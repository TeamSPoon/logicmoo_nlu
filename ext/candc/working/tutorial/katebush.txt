Kate Bush (born 30 July 1958) is an English singer, songwriter, musician, and
record producer. Her eclectic musical style and idiosyncratic lyrics have made
her one of England’s most successful solo female performers of the past 30 years.
Bush was signed by EMI at the age of 16 after being recommended by Pink Floyd’s
David Gilmour. In 1978, aged 19, she topped the UK charts for four weeks with
her debut song “Wuthering Heights”, becoming the first woman to have a UK
number one with a self-written song.
