What do you think about the new Eminem song?
I haven't heard it, what's it about.
Well it's pretty political.
Really, he usually stays out of politics
Yeah, well not this time, he's rapping about Trump!`
I bet that is pretty funny, does he have a new album out?
I don't think so.
What was your favorite Eminem album?
Definitely the Slim Shady LP
mine too, that had so many good songs
It sure did.
You can really hear the influence from Dre
Yes and he collaborated on quite a few songs on that album.
Didn't he produce it?
Oh yeah, I think it was produced under Death Row Records
He is definitely a rap god at this point.
He is but he's no notorious BIG
Well that's for sure
Rest in peace Biggie.
Rest in peace....<pours some 40 on the floor>
