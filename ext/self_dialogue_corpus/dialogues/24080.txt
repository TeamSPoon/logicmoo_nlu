Have you seen Independence Day, Part 2?
Yeah, I just saw it last weekend.
What did you think about it?
I thought it sucked.
I know me too. It could have been so much better.
The first one is my favorite movie of all times, so I was really looking forward to this one.
Did you see that Will SMith's character was killed off?
Yeah, I read he wanted too much money for the second part.
I think the movie would've been better if he had been in it.
What did you think about the plot?
I didn't find it very believable. The movie was not very suspenseful.
Yeah, it was not as exciting as the first one.
I did like that Jeff Goldblum and Bill Pullman were back.
What did you think of the special effects?
They were good but it was too much action and not enough substance.
Yeah, I didn't think the special effects were too impressive.
Do you think there will be a third part?
I don't know. If there is, are you going to see it?
I don't think so. I think I'm done with this franchise.
Yeah me too.
