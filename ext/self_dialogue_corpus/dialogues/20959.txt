Did you ever see World War Z?
Still haven't gotten a chance yet, but remember it coming out.
It's actually a pretty decent flick, you should check it out.
I remember that it was a production nightmare.
Yeah, they totally rewrote the last part of the movie.
That's what I heard.  The third act is completely different.
Apparently Brad Pitt didn't like the direction the movie went.
Which is strange really.  He read the script, right?
I'm sure, but apparently it didn't translate to the screen like they wanted.
So what changed?  Don't spoil it for me, but give me a hint.
Sure.  I guess the original script had him being way too action-heroey, if that's even a word.
It's not, but I get what you mean.  He was too much of a fighter vs. what his character should have been?
Exactly.  So they reshot the end to make him more measured.
Sounds like it was a smart move.
It was in the end.  A lot of people credit it with saving the production.
I remember that they feared it could bomb at the box office.
Yep.  But instead of being an expensive failure, it made money.
You know what's crazy?
What's that?
We haven't even talked about the zombies in a zombie movie yet!
