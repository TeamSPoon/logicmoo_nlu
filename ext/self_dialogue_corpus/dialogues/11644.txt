Do you like the earlier beatles music or the later Beatles music better.
The earlier songs are some of my favorites.
Like which songs?
She Loves You and I Wanna Hold Your Hand.
Those are both good songs.
I think some of the later songs got too far out there.
I think they were doing a lot of drugs then.
Like Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds being about LSD?
Exactly. Some of the later songs lost the simpleness of the earlier music.
They did seem to get more complicated.
