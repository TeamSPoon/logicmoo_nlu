Good morning!
Good morning to you; how are you?
Just fine! Woke up to a groovin' song on my iPhone.
What's your alarm?
I have it linked with my Google Play, so just whatever top 40 song is up next.
What was today's?
"Something Just Like This" by the Chainsmokers.
Nice, I love the Chainsmokers!
Me too, they have such an energetic beat to them.
Indeed, though I think I'd hate to have that as my alarm.
Oh? What do you use?
I like to wake up peacefully, so I usually play a soft soundtrack piece.
Really? Like what?
Well, lately I've been using the theme from Finding Nemo.
Whoa, that's so soft. That would never wake me!
It works for me, and I love soundtrack pieces, so.
Do you have a favourite composer?
I love Howard Shore's stuff.
He did the Lord of the Rings soundtrack, right?
Yeah, he's a genius.
