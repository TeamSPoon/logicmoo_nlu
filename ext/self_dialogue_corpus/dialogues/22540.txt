I finally rented the 2017 version of Beauty and the Beast.
Really? I've been wanting to see it!
I rented it on MGo for me and the kids.
How much was it?
$5.99 plus tax.
Did you like it?
Yea it was a good movie. I was basically just like the cartoon version we knew as kids but with real people.
What about the Beast? I've heard people say they were disappointed with the animation.
I didn't see an issue with the Beast. He was like I imaged. I even think his voice resembled that of the original.
How were the effects?
There were a lot of effects, obviously,I thought they were really good.
When did the original Beauty and the Beast come out?
1991! I was only 6 years old.
Do you want to hear some fun facts about the movie?
Yes, of course!
There were over 8,200 candles used as set decorations during production.
Wow! That is a lot of wax. What else?
Approximately 1,500 red roses were grown or purchased during production for use as research or set decoration.
Someone go rich off of that!
Yes I know, we are in the wrong business friend!
