Did you see the Second Guardians of The Galaxy movie?
Yeah that movie is hilarious.
I saw it too and really liked it.
It is a great movie. I am so glad Disney owns Marvel.
Me too. I loved the jokes in this one.
I still love the characters Star Lord and Gamora.
Their banter is so funny. That other guy is hilarious too.
Which one?
Yondu. He is kinda greyish green with the red veins.
Oh yeah I love that guy. He has a great dry sense of humor in the movie.
