What team do you hate most in the NFL?
It is for sure, the Steelers.
Why do you hate them the most?
The NFL seems to favor them. They always  get all of the breaks.
Is that the only reason?
Heck no. I also cannot stand their fans. They are very annoying and are bandwagon fans.
Are you sure that your not generalizing?
Maybe to a point but still, the majority of the steelers fans that I know have no ties to the city or team whatsoever.
Don't fans have the right to root for any team that they want?
Of course. However, it is still frowned upon to be a band wagon fan and root for a team just because they are good.
I could understand that. However, nobody likes to root for a loser.
This is true. However, it builds character being a fan of a bad team.
Any other reasons why you dislike them so much?
I also can't stand how annoying their fans are. They just seem very rude and classless.
I think a lot of NFL fans are like that these days.
This is true but I have met some fan bases that are good fans and treat you with respect.
What fans base did you like the most?
I think 49er fans were very respectful when I went to see a game there.
Did you like any other fan bases?
Surprisingly, I found cowboys fans to be quite respectful when i saw a game there as well.
