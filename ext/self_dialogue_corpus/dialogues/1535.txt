Who do you think makes the playoffs in ncaa football this season?
Conversation starts with Alabama as usual. Roll tide.
Of course. Let's get Ohio State in the mix too.
Clemson out of the ACC.
Oklahoma Sooners.
Even with Stoops resigning? That gives me pause with a new regime.
Good point, I forgot.
Washington could be back in the mix again.
You know, they're interesting. I think they'll still be quality but they lost some key defensive guys in the draft.
Their secondary might take a step back, but they'll still be good and the PAC-10 isn't great.
PAC-10 isn't great, but I have a feeling USC is about to have another run. They seem poised to get back in the top tier.
Yeah, they have Darnold so they should be in for a good showing.
Who are we forgetting?
Florida State. Florida Gators for that matter.
I don't know about Florida, I still have LSU better than them as well as Alabama.
At the risk of flooding with SEC, I think you can throw Auburn into the mix for potential.
Dark horse for Wisconsin, I just have a feeling they can come out strong in the B1G.
Interesting. I was looking through their profiles earlier and it looks like their returning some key guys.
What about Penn St? Can't forget Penn St.
We'd all like to forget about Penn St.
