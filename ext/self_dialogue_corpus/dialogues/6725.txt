Do you know what Disney movie I've always disliked?
What one?
The Little Mermaid. It drives me insane.
Oh no. Why is that?
I hate that Ariel gives up her mermaid life for a man.
Yeah, that's quite the sacrifice. Who wouldn't want to live under the sea?
I wish I could be under the sea right now!
Me too! Especially to escape this scorching summer heat.
That chick's voice is annoying too.
Wow. You've got some strong feelings about poor Ariel.
