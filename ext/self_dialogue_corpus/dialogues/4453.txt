Today is the anniversry of the release of Jaws.
That is my favorite movie, I watch it like once a month.
I used to watch it all the time as a kid.  Its why I can't go into the ocean.
Scared you that much huh.
Yeah, that top view shot they do whenthe shark swims next to the boat and its as long as the boat, that scared me to death.
Were gonna need a bigger boat.
Exactly.  Or when the woman is swimming at the beginning and gets dragged ever all over before being pulled under.
You know they did that scene by tieing ropes around her waist and pulling her back and forth to make it look real.
Yeah, I saw the documentry about it.  Didn't make it any less scary.
No, it didn't but it was great to see how they made it look so real.
