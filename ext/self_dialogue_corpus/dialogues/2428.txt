Wiill you be watching and NFL games this season?
You know that it a crazy question, I will be infront of that tv.
Who you do you think will take it this year?
I'm thinking that the Giants will pull it off.
Are you serious? I'm thinking that Washington Redskins will have a good chance this year.
Why do you think that, do you know something I don't?
Not really, I just know that nothing is impossible with any team.
Well from the perdictions I read recently, the Redskins are in poor shape.
Like what have you heard?
According to Bovada, the Redskins chances of winning the next Super Bowl come in at 50-1.
Get out of here; that is just their opinion.
Don't take it so bad, eight other teams have worse odds than the RedSkins, ha ha.
I'm not taking it bad, I just can't believe your letting perdictions persuade your outlook on the team.
No, I'm just trying to get under your skin, in a teasing way. Nothing serious.
Not taking it to heart. But, I will say this, I think Redskins will prove those perdictions wrong.
Well stay positive, because that is what a diehard fan does.
Believe me, I'm sticking with my team, been a fan through the good and the bad.
I have to say, it is the same here. I never thought of rooting for another team; just the Giants.
Well good luck to you.
Thanks and good luck to you too.
