I've been listening to this new band called Pink Floyd. Have you heard of them?
I wouldn't call them exactly new, dude. I'm surprised you discovered them.
As the networks used to say, it's not a repeat if you haven't seen it. So they're new to me.
You're still playing vinyl, aren't you?
I gotta tape deck.
Ok, I'll bite. What's your favorite song or album?
I really like Animals. Robin Watkers really wrote some fantastic lyrics.
I think that's Roger Waters. Did you know that the album was created in response to....
Excuse me, I'm talking now. The piece called Time is very moving. The clock section is tremendous.
That's not even on that album. That's on Dark Side of the Moon.
That's what I meant. Who are you to question what I meant to say when I said it? Anyway, they are my favorite five group band, next to the Backstreet Boys,
There were only four members. One died.
I said that there were four. Why don't you listen to me when I think of what I'm going to say? Now there's three. Robin Watkers died. He played drums.
You're waaay off. Robin Watkers, I mean Roger Waters is not dead. Musically maybe but he's very much alive and he did not play drums, although in his mind he probably thought we did. Kind of a little like you.
So who played drums then, smarty-pants?
Nick Mason did. He's still alive.
Doesn't he run a jar factory on the side? My Gamma always talked about how good those jars were.
I think I'm going to hemorrhage.
Oh, that's the name of their third album, I think. It had a guy singing with pixies.
Lord, please take me now. Don't care where.
