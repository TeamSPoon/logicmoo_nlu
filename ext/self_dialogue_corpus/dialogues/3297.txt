What's your favorite horror movie?
Has to be Texas Chainsaw Massacre.
Oh, God. That movie scares me so much!
Ugh, the sounds in that movie alone are enough to creep me out.
Yes. Like in the beginning with those camera bulb flashes and the high pitched twanging noise?
That scared me, too! Hey, remember when the girl is in the farmhouse and she stumbles into that room of bones?
How could I forget? She falls down, she's crying, and she's just covered in all those human bones.
Yeah, and there's like a lampshade with skin on it.
That movie destroyed me for years. Like, I think I developed a condition.
Who could blame you? I can't think of another film that's been nearly as terrifying.
