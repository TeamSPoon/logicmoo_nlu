Who do you think wins the NL Central this year?
Chicago.
I want to believe that but its hard to repeat.
It is but not winning the division.
The Braves did it how many years in a row?
I think 13.
Yeah, so this could happen.
The Cardinals can never be counted out.
What about the Pirates?
I think their window closed.
That was quick. What a terrible franchise.
I think McCutchen is on his way out.
His defense is starting to wane.
They have moved his outfield position already.
Yeah, they dont have a ton of pitching outside of Cole.
They had the momentum for awhile.
But back to the Cubs. Are they a dynasty?
Theo Epstein only creates winners.
They drafted well.
Thats the key to winning in baseball, it takes time to rebuild.
