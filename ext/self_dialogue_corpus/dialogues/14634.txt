Will an expansion team ever come to the NBA?
I think Vegas could be next
Do they really need expansion though?
Not really, the qaulity of rosters isnt that great right now.
Yeah I think they need to tell future players they have to wait 3 years out of high school.
The problem is theyll just go overseas.
Then they should say 3 years in college.
How do you tell a player they have to go to school though when they have free will?
I dont know they have to figure that out.
Well back to Vegas, do you think a 2nd team will come in?
With the way games are scheduled I dont think you need to have 2 teams.
Yeah they could probably do with just 1.
How do you staff a team like that?
Let them pick 1, 2, and 3 in the NBA draft and then make 5 selections from the best 5 teams in the league.
Why punish a team for having a good roster?
Well you want the franchise to be good, to increase attendance.
I dont see that being an issue in Vegas.
Its more of a tourist place though.
Yeah but to catch a sporting event out there? People would do it.
They may but you need a winner on the court right away.
