Wow, I can't believe the original Star Wars movie is 40 years old!
Yeah, it came out in 1977.
Who knew it would be so popular?
I don't think anyone knew.
I still think It was the best one if all.
I like it too. Who is your favorite character?
Han Solo.  What about you!
Chewbacca for sure!
It's a great movie, even after all these years!
It sure is.  I could watch it a million times!
