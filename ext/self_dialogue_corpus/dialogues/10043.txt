Action seems to be one of the strongest genres going. I mean, John Wick alone
That franchise will run out of gas eventually, but yeah, good stuff
The only dark spot is the Fast & Furious franchise. That has been a drag for several movies now
Totally. I'm liking these more under the radar films anyway, like The Guest
Such a good movie. The bigger films are a bit stale, as usual
Especially when Tom Cruise is wasting time with the likes of The Mummy
That was a crap fest from the beginning. It was easy to sense that it was going to fail
I do think the future as always is through gritty, small budget films
The guy who'll next break out is the one that did Blue Ruin and The Green Room.
He's gonna be big, agreed.
