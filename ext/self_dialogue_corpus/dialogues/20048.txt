So, what's your favorite movie?
I really like Man on Fire with Denzel Washington.
Was Denzel Washington in that movie Deja Vu?
He was, I watched it on Netflix last week actually.
You know I watched The Secret Life of Pets on Netflix with my kids last weekend.
I saw that with my kids in the movie theater, that was a good movie.
My kids really liked that new Moana movie too.
I really like Moana.
Disney has been making some good movies lately.
My two little girls just loved Frozen.
Did you see the new Beauty and the Beast?
No, I haven't seen that one yet.
The last movie I saw in the theater was the new M. Night Shyamalan movie.
He's a really good director I think.
I didn't really like that one movie Lady in the Water.
No, but Signs and the Village were really good movies.
I heard that M. Night Shyamalan is making a sequel or something to Unbreakable.
I don't think I saw that movie.
Bruce Willis starred in Unbreakable, so did Samuel L. Jackson.
Oh yeah, wasn't that the one where he was like a superhero or something?
