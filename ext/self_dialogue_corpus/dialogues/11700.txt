You like The Beatles, right?
Of course, they're one of the best bands of all time!
I know, right? Anyway, I was just listening to Rubber Soul.
That's a great album! What's your favorite song on it?
Hmm, I would have to say "In My Life."
Yeah, that's a really great one!
What about you?
I love Nowhere Man.
The harmonies in that are excellent!
Yes! That's what I love about the song!
