My boyfriend's a singer in a metal band.
Really? That's impressive.
Oh, are you a fan of metal music?
To be honest, not really. It can be a little overwhelming for me. But I admire the skill it takes to play it!
Fair enough. What kinds of music do you like?
I love musical songs!
Really? What musicals?
Well, like pretty much everyone else in the world, I love the music from Hamilton.
Hamilton is pretty hot right now.
It really is!
What other musicals do you like?
The new Anastasia Broadway music really is nostalgic for me.
Oh, did you watch the movie as a child?
I did, and I loved it!
Any other newer Broadway shows you like?
I like the music from Dear Evan Hansen.
Oh, I heard that had won some awards.
I think it might have. I just know I love the music!
Okay, I confess: you're getting me intrigued. Any music you would recommend for me?
Try Next to Normal as you like rock.
