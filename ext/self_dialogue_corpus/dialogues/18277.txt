What's your favorite time period for music?
You mean like whether I like 60s music, 70s music, and so on?
Yes, that's it. I'm really into the 90s.
Oh, okay. I'm much more of a 70s person.
Why is that?
Well, I really like the variety. You can get classic rock, punk, early New Wave, progressive rock, and so on.
That's fair. But don't you like grunge and metal?
I do, but there's no way you can beat bands like Pink Floyd.
I'll admit that I do really love some of those punk bands.
It was an excellent mix.
Still, some of those bands were still around in the 90s.
So, you're saying that the 90s is offering the best of both musical worlds?
That's exactly what I'm saying.
I don't buy it. Those bands weren't at their best by that point.
I thought Pink Floyd's Final Cut was respectable.
Respectable, sure. But how respectable?
It was respectable enough to sell really well.
Yeah, but there's no way it can stand up to Wish You Were Here.
Maybe so. Thanks for the chat.
Definitely. Thank you, too.
