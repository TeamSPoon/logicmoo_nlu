I have great news!
What is your news?
That new movie, Moana, is on Netflix!
Really?
Yes, I was so excited, my kids and I watched it right away.
I think that it's great that Netflix picks up newer movies.
Me too, my kids watched Zootopia twice a day, everyday, it's nice to switch it up a bit.
Zootopia is a good movie too.
I agree, I'm just glad we can throw some variety into the mix now and again.
I will have to bring over some popcorn and watch Moana with you guys this weekend!
