Who is your favorite rock group?
Rolling stones. they are awesome and still going!
I will say that is great to see them still rocking it.
Keith Richards has so much stamina still.
I am surprised he has not had a drug overdose and died yet.
It is a little awe inspiring, that he lived so hard and still working.
Drugs were so much a part of the rock and world scene.
I think they still are part of that world and lifestyle.
To some degree but back in their hayday it was so present in the rock culture.
I think it is just a little more hushed up now, but still very much there in the music rock scene.
