What's your favorite Disney movie?
I really like Pete's Dragon.
The new one?
Yes, the one that just came out last year.
I really liked how they kept the story in line with the time period.
Yeah, they didn't try to make it more modern. But the dragon was top notch!
It was a really charming and heartwarming story.
I thought it was very authentic myself.
I liked the car chase scene at the end.
That was my favorite as well.
