Now, Naomie Harris really had a stunning dress!
That white Calvin Klein? Gorgeous!
Speaking of stunning in white, Priyanka Chopra's geometrical gown was absolutely beautiful.
I agree, it fit her to a 'T'. Ralph & Russo should be proud.
There was plenty of gold on this red carpet!
Emma Stone giving flapper chic in Givenchy and Halle Berry also went with some gold fringe with her gown. Both were sparkling!
There certainly were some sparkling gems on the carpet!
Yes,  that gorgeous Bvulgari necklace draped around Alicia Vikander's neck!
There were a lot of great suits this year as well.
Dev Patel looked bright and chic in his white Burberry jacket and Justin Timberlake's Tom Ford couldn't have fit better!
It was so great to see Jessica Biel step out of her box and wear that to-die-for gold gown.
She always looks great on the red carpet but I agree this is one of her better dresses!
Lots of my favorite gals are sporting super short hair cuts right now which I love!
I wish I could pull off Ginnifer Goodwin's look, that short hair and the red gown.
Pharrell looked relatively tame this year.
He still found a way to add a little flair though with that long jacket and simplified frill-shirt, I can appreciate that.
There were some pretty fun colors on this red carpet too! That brighter navy blue suit that Riz Ahmed wore was so spring-y!
He would have looked great standing next to Leslie Mann in her yellow gown. She looked like Belle from Beauty and the Beast!
I think one of my absolute favorite dresses was that silver and creme fringe dream that Sofia Boutella wore!
I think we can both agree, you can never go wrong with wearing Chanel.
