Did you ever see the movie 'Cloud Atlas'?
No, but I read the book.
Oh, I didn't even know it was a book.
Yep, it was a big bestseller. That's why they made the movie.
Ah, I see. How did you like the book.
It was actually pretty awesome! I loved it.
Interesting. The movie was only OK, I thought.
Then they must not have adapted it well, because the book was fantastic.
The movie wasn't bad, don't get me wrong. Just not amazing.
Did the story kind of follow different characters throughout time?
Yep, that's how it went.
Who were the stars of the movie?
Tom Hanks was probably the biggest name.
Wow, you're saying it was a Tom Hanks movie and an adaptation of Cloud Atlas, and you didn't like it?
Yep, that's what I'm saying.
That surprises me. That sounds like a recipe for success.
Not according to me! You might think differently.
I would be interested in seeing it, yeah.
If you like it, then maybe you just think the concept is cooler than I do.
That's possible.
