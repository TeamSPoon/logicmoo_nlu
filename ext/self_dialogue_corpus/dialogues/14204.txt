Lady Gaga's music video for Telephone is a work of art.
I agree. The costume design alone makes it fantastic.
Totally, and the nod toward Thelma and Louise towards the end of the video is great.
Beyonce and Lady Gaga make such a great duo.
They are both so talented.
Oh, there's no doubt. Lady Gaga actually co-wrote the script for the Telephone music video.
Wow, I had no idea. She's so creative.
She helps write a lot of her songs, too.
I think that that's so nice. It seems a lot of singers don't write their own songs these days.
I totally agree. I actually read somewhere that Lady Gaga wrote Telephone for Britney Spears.
