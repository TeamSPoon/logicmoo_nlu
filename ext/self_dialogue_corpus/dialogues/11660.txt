Okay, so, I saw a friend of mine once at the local park.  Him and his band were performing various songs including some tunes by the Beatles.
Oh, that's cool, what ones did they do?
You know,  I can't recall off-hand, but it was kind of weird..
What do you mean?
They're were playing this one song where the guy is mentioning suicide and stuff and I'm like, "Whoa... is this the same band that song 'I Wanna Hold Your Hand' and 'Let It Be' and all those?
Well, they've gone their share of sad songs before.  Like "Yesterday" and "Long and Winding Road".
Yeah, plus I asked my friend about that after the show and he explained that the particular was from the White album.  And I'm like, "Oh, that makes sense."
How so?
Well, I've been told that's kind of an odd album in Beatles discography. Among other things, it's the one Charles Manson was claiming he was hearing "secret messages" from.
Meh... I'm not sure Manson is someone we should turn to for any sort of reliable info.
