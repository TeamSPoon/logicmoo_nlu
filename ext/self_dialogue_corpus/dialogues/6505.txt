Me and the kids watched Aladdin yesterday. I forgot how much I love that movie!
Yeah!  I loved that one as a kid!
It's still great as an adult, but you definitely notice different things.
Like what?
Abu is a pain in the butt!  It's because of him the chamber closed, and he didn't want to share with the street kids.
I never thought of that!  Were the songs still as good?
Yes!  My kids have been singing them all day today.
"A whole new world"!  Haha, I used to sing that constantly as a kid.  Must have driven my Mom nuts!
Me too!  Now I know how my Mom felt.  They're driving me nuts!
Would you mind if I borrow it?  I'd love to watch it again.
