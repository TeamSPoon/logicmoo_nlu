What is a good thriller movie to watch?
How about Final Destination? That one always gets me.
Oh I remember that, with Devon Sawa?
Yup, that's him.
That movie really scared me when I was a teenager.
Of course it scared you, it was a movie about Death chasing a bunch of teenagers.
It wasn't just that though.
What was it then?
It was how no one really has control. One day you're here, the next you're not, super creepy.
Well, it sounds like you picked your thriller movie then.
