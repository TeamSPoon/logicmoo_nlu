Have you seen Frozen?
No, not yet, I haven't.
Really? I feel like everybody's seen it by now.
Yeah, I haven't really had the desire, but there's a lady at work who is obsessed with Olaf.
Oh my gosh, Olaf is my favorite! I have a stuffed Olaf at home.
I see him all the time when I go to Target, kids seem to love him.
I'm not surprised, he really is a fan favorite; maybe even more popular than Elsa!
Who is Elsa? Is she the one with white hair?
Elsa is the main character in Frozen. Man, you really have a lot of catching up to do!
I really do, I'm not hip with the jive anymore. What are you doing this weekend?
