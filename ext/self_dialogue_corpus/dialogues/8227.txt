What do you think about Adele?
I kind of don't care for her.
Why not?  She's a great singer.
Oh, she's good.  Her music is just boring.
She has so much emotion in her music though.
I think she does, but it's just not for me.
I guess we all have our opinion.
Don't get me wrong though, she deserves all her awards.
You wouldn't buy her album though.
Nope.  Not me.
