Hey, did you hear that new song by Rihanna?
You mean the one called, "Wild Thoughts"?
Yeah, that one!
I love that track. I love how they sampled Santana's old beat.
Oh yeah! Wasn't that originally in that song, "Maria, Maria"?
Yeah! I think it came out around the early 2000's.
I totally remember jamming out to that song as a kid. I loved the music video.
So did I! What do you think of Rihanna's newest tracks anyways?
I do like them a lot, but sometimes I miss her old stuff.
Yeah, she has a lot of spunk now which is so cool, but sometimes the songs can get repetitive.
I totally agree. Speaking of female vocalists, Remy Ma is on a roll isn't she?
Yeah, since she got released she has been just letting out track after track. Did you hear the Nicki Minaj dis?
Yeah, I did. I think I like, "No Frauds" better though, to be honest.
I agree. That was an awesome single. I usually don't like Drake, but on that he was good.
Wow, I thought the same thing! I'm not a fan of him, but he was good on that.
Yeah, and so was Lil Wayne.
Yeah he was! I was surprised they featured him on it.
Me too, I didn't think he would want to get involved.
It made for a good song, though.
It sure did!
