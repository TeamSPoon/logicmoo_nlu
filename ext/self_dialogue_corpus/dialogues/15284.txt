Do you like David Bowie or Talking Heads better?
Oh -- Bowie was great!  He really could play all sorts of music.
Do you like him better than Talking Heads?
Well, I can't really say that.  I like the way Talking Heads incorporated all sorts of world music touches into their music.
They both used Brian Eno as a producer at different times in their career. What do you think of him?
Eno is kind of abstract.  Talking Heads and David Bowie made more accessible music, in my opinion.
So. if you had to decide between them, which one would you pick?
I find Bowie easier to dance to.  He always manages to keep the beat going!
Then you would pick David Bowie?
Well, the Talking Heads -- particularly on their last three albums, where they used *zouk* style rhythms -- made very danceable music.
I'd agree with you there. Their first three albums are overly cerebral: too many self-aware lyrics, and too simplistic a musical style.
Actually, I think that's why Brian Eno picked both Bowie and the Talking Heads to produce: a simple musical style.
That's a good point.  Eno liked to find a groove and build on it; it seems that a simple style would be more attractive to him.
So -- between David Bowie and the Talking Heads, who would you choose?
I would go with the Talking Heads: I think that both their lyrical and musical style had more development over the course of their career.
Wouldn't you agree, though, that Bowie's lyrics were more relevant to his audience throughout the years?
That's a good point: he made alienation into a virtue, and yet always retained a strong sense of irony. Look at his last single: 'Lazarus'.
Knowing what we know now -- that he was that close to death -- it must have taken some courage to address it head on like that.
Musical courage -- I think that that really sums up David Bowie.  He never held back!
And that is, I think, why I would have to choose David Bowie over Talking Heads.  They were both really good, though.
