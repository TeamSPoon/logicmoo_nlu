Have you seen the new Beauty and the Beast yet?
No, but I want to! Is it good?
Oh, it's just great. I loved it.
Does it follow the animated one's storyline?
Yes, pretty close.
I think I'd be upset if they changed it too much.
No, they didn't mess with the story. Some things were added, but they fit in very well.
Like what?
Well, we get to learn what happened to Bell's mother, for example. How she died.
That sounds intriguing. I can't wait to see it!
