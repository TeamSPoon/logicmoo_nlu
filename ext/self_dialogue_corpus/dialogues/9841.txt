Do you like rap?
yes, I do, I love it, I think LL cool J is my favorite
Oh ya, he is awesome, whats your favorite song from him?
I would have to say "doin it".
Yes, thats a great one. Do you listen to wrap often
I listen a couple times a week, I like it when I am working out or doing yard work
Thats a great idea, the beat would keep you moving for sure
It does, and sometimes my neighbors catch me singing or dancing
oh man thats hilarious
and embarrasing
