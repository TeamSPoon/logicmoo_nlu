I feel like saying that rap is dead is just absurd.
I agree. Too many people are stuck in the past.
Exactly! Sure, guys like Tupac and Biggie are masters of the game, but they created quite the legacy.
People just generalize too much.
Right? It's like one song is enough to illustrate the whole genre to most people.
I know. It's ridiculous, isn't it?
Absolutely. Like, just look at J. Cole.
Oh man, Cole is awesome!
He just knows how to make good rap music.
That he does. And music with some real meaning, too.
His song "High for Hours" really got me thinking when I first heard it.
I don't think I've heard that one. Is it new?
Yeah. He just released it at the start of the year.
I'll definitely look it up.
What's your favorite song of his?
It definitely has to be Change. He does a great job of expressing his philosophy in that song.
I agree. It's a very empowering song.
If only more people thought like that.
There'd be far less wrong with the world.
My thoughts exactly.
