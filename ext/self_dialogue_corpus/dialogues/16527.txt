I'm one of those people who really fears the dentist.
Everybody fears the dentist.
I guess, but I'm absolutely phobic, and the sound of the drill sets me off. So I got a Baroque music tape to drown it out.
Your dentist let you?
Yeah, she didn't care. So I'd turn up some Brandenburgs or whatever when the drilling started, and feel relatively relaxed.
This worked?
Oh yeah.
I should try that.
Yeah, it seemed to kill the pain, too.
I'm definitely going to try it.
Yeah, well, there is a slight problem though.
Yeah?
Yeah. Now when I hear certain tunes, like in an elevator or something, I tense up a bit.
But it seems like it would be worth it.
Maybe. You know my neice got married last month?
Yeah. You told me all about it.
Not everything. She came up the aisle, and the sun was shining, the flowers were beautiful, and I was miserable.
They were playing Bach?
No, Pachelbel, actually, the Canon in D. Solemn joy. It was horrible.
Wow. I'll just take novocaine.
