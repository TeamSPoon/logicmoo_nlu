What is your favorite Steve Martin movie?
I like "The Jerk", have you seen? Its a classic
Oh yeah, I have seen that one. Its good, but not my favorite.
well which one is your favorite?
The one where he is traveling with John Candy.
You mean  "Planes, Trains and Automobiles?"
Yes! His frusteration makes me laugh everytime he thinks he is about to ditch Candy.
Steve Martin had great physical comedy in "The Jerk".
Really? What was your favorite scene
When he is working at the gas station and the shooter is shooting at him.
I don't think i remember that scene....
He is being shot at and the shoot misses and hits the oil cans.He runs in the store and hides behind the window display .
Is that the scene where he is yellling:" The cans! He hates the cans! Stay away from the cans!"
yeah, that is a pretty funny scene.
I think the scene in Planes, Trains and Automobiles where he and Candy have to share a bed is way funnier.
no way. It was cliche at best.
Perhaps, but the baffoonery of The Jerk is clearly a hangover from his television days.
I disagree, I think it was more a statement of gangly pubessence  in an adult and his transition away from the country.
Seriously? You don't like it was from culture clash?
Could Be, in the opening he did say he was born a poor black child, when in reality they raised him.
