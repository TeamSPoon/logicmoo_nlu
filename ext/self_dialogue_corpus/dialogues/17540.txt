What is you thoughts on One Direction?
I think they had a decent run.
I never even got into them until they broke up.
Really? What song drew you in?
I heard the one called Night Moves.
That is a really cool one.
I know.
Most people think they just make kid music.
They actually had some good songs.
I even like their more pop type ones.
Like That's What Makes you Beautiful?
Yes, it is catchy.
They have some decent solo stuff.
Like what?
Harry Style has one called Sign of Times.
I heard that song, did not know it was his!
Yes, he even wrote it.
It sounds like an old Bob Dylan song.
I think it will be a classic.
I hope the others do just as well as him.
