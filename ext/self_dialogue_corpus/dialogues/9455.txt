Hey, man how was your weekend? I mostly chilled out to some Drake.
It was great! I just got back from a Drake concert last night!
No way, you're a fan of Drake too?
Yeah, i've been listening to him since he released "Thank Me Later".
Wow, so you're a long time fan, huh?
Yeah, what do you think of his latest album?
I mean I just started getting into his songs, but so far, I like what I hear.
Yeah, I really like everything on "Views", it really speaks to me.
I'll try to give it a listen tonight, talk to you later man!
Yeah, hit me up sometime, we should go see him live when he's back in town!
