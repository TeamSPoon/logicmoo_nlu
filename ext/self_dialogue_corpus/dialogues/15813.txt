How well do you know the band Modest Mouse?
Not too well, I just remember there one giant hit, "Float On."
That is the song most people know them by. Did you like it?
Yeah, it was strange sounding for sure, but also magnetic and compelling. It wasn't like anything I knew when it came out in 2003.
Ha! That's what drew me to them as a band initially. Their weirdness and idiosyncracies.
Yeah, weird can be good. There's for sure good weird in music.
Well, Float On isn't exactly characteristic of all of their stuff. My favorite stuff is their earlier stuff and it's way different.
How so? What do you mean?
For the most part it's less produced, but it's also moodier and less poppy.
So even weirder?
Yes, even weirder, but in the greatest way imaginable.
Well, what do you recommend I check out?
I think their absolute masterpiece is the Lonesome Crowded West.
Why do you pick that one?
It's about America. It's still relevant today.
About America in what sense?
It's about alienation, mass culture, sprawl, road trips, religion, seedy night clubs, banking, lawyers, and more.
That does all sound like America. When did it come out?
That's the amazing thing. It came out in 1997, which is now twenty years ago, but it is still super relevant.
Okay, I'm adding it to my queue now on Spotify. You've sold me.
