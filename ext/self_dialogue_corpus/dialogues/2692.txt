Can't believe the pAnthers picked up McCaffrey.
How so? Panthers is a running team.
That's why. They have already pretty good running game, what they shoould've done is a picked up a good WR.
Well Panther's running game is largely driven by Jonathan Stewart and Cam Newton
Yeah, Cam's the second in their team in terms of running yards
And that's not really a good thing, because the QB can get hurt running. They need another RB
They have other RBs,. Whitaker, Artis-Payne, etc. Don't need another RB
Yeah, but they're not as good as McCaffrey. He's a beast
He is good. i wished they picked up another WR or a TE
Another TE on top of Olsen? Olsen is already no 3 TE in the league
Who's no 1? Gronk?
No, Surprisingly, Travis Kelce
Oh yeah, Alex Smith does love his TEs.
And to think the beginning of the season last year, we were all like "OMG, KC Chiefs running game is stacked!"
Haha, Charcandrick West was such a disappointment.
Anyway, another WR for Panthers is kinda redundant at this time. Between Olsen, Benjamin and Ginn Jr, they have over 2700 yards
How does that comp[are to other teams?
Like in terms of passing yards? The team that passes the most is New Orleans Saints. Brees loves to throw. They had over 5000 yards passing last year
That's close to double that of panthers
Well passing between the top 3 of Pather's receiving core. Pathers had over 3600 yards passing last year
