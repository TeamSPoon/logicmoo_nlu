Who is your favorite team?
I really love the Reds.
Me too! It is just a shame that they never make it far in the playoffs.
True. After trading away some key players in the past couple years, I wonder if they will recover.
Not sure, but the Houston Astros look red hot recently.
Jose Altuve has an unbelievable batting average.
He is also a solid infielder!
Yes. Did you see the Astros beat the Yankees on Derek Jeter celebration night?
No. But that is sad. Derek Jeter is a terrific player.
Yeah a real class act. The Yankees have gone downhill since his retirement in 2014.
That's okay with me. I was getting tired of watching them win all the time.
You know who I've been really impressed by? The Cleveland Indians.
Why do you say that?
They made a huge run in the post-season last year. And their roster is not nearly as deep as some of the other teams.
True. I heard they really play as a team. Cleveland must really be excited that their team was a contender for a world series title.
Maybe they will make a run for it again this year. Especially if Francisco Lindor stays hot.
Lindor is from Puerto Rico. I saw the Astros play the Marlins in an international game in Puerto Rico last night.
That's awesome! I did not know they did that.
I guess it was some sort of special occasion. But cool to learn about Puerto Rican baseball history.
I bet there is a rich history there. Yadier Molina for the Cardinals is also from Puerto Rico. Lots of great players are. Probably because of the nice weather!
