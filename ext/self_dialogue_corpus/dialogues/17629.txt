Okay, possible unpopular music opinion about to be stated here.
Leave my girl Beyonce out of it and I'm sure you'll be fine. Proceed.
I wouldn't dream of taking on the Beyhive. But I do think No Doubt is better than solo Gwen Stefani.
Ouch. Although I guess it'd probably be meaner to the guys to say she's better without them.
It would be meaner. I just think the group had better songs.
You know, I'm not sure that's such an unpopular opinion.
So you agree?
I agree that 'Hollaback Girl' can't hold a candle to the iconic 'Don't Speak'.
Or 'Just a Girl' or 'Sunday Morning' or 'Ex-Girlfriend' or...
Whoa, you are really not a fan of 'Hollaback Girl' are you?
Ha, I just think the No Doubt stuff is so much better.
There is a different style between that and her solo stuff.
Definitely. No Doubt had so much more of the ska vibe.
Are you really into that genre?
Not particularly. It just seems superior when comparing it to straight pop.
Maybe that's the issue; you're comparing things that aren't really comparable.
I guess you're right. It just seems a shame that she left to do worse music.
Well, in your opinion anyway.
Yes, yes. Isn't that all that should matter?
Oh, you're a funny one. Funny and delusional.
