I like rap, but I don't like that gangster stuff.
Me neither. Who wants to hear about a gold chain?
Nobody does. What is something good that is rap but not about cars?
Have you ever heard of A Tribe Called Quest?
No I have not. Who are they?
They are an alternative hip hop group from what they call the Golden Era Of Hip Hop.
That sounds like what I am looking for.
It is what you are looking for. Have you ever heard of Jungle Brothers?
Yes they are great.
A Tribe Called Quest was friends with them and collaborated a few times.
That is so awesome!
It is. Their songs were about empowered people not making them jealous.
Where would I start if I wanted to listen to them?
I would check out the album Midnight Marauders.
That sounds like my type of album.
It is so smooth you need to check it out now.
So what is good about this album?
The way they use samples are so amazing. You just have to hear it to believe it.
That is great. I love when musicians sample other music.
Me too. Hopefully we don't get draconian copyright laws in the future which prevent us from hearing new music.
