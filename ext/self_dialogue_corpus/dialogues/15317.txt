I like the new Twenty One Pilots single.
Which one?
That one they did for the Suicide Squad movie. It's called Heathens.
Oh, cool. Is it good?
Yeah, it's got a night haunting background with a little beat thrown in.
Sounds like I'd like it. Have they put out any other new music?
They have! They did a cover of Cancer by My Chemical Romance.
How's it sound?
I listened to Twenty One Pilots rendition of it first and loved it. But then listened to My Chemical Romance's and didn't like theirs.
So they made it better?
Oh, definitely. It sounds really sad. I love it.
I will have to check it out.
Oh, also, Twenty One Pilots did a studio session with MuteMath. They redid a few of their old songs.
Sounds interesting. Who is MuteMath?
A small collaboration between Paul Meany and Darren King. You might like them too.
I'll have to check them out. I never heard of them.
Well, get the new Twenty One Pilots stuff I told you about and then check out MuteMath.
I will definitely do that.
We should go to a Twenty One Pilots concert together sometime.
I'm down for that. Just let me know when and where!
