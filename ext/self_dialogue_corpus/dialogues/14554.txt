Did you see the Rockets get completely destroyed by the Spurs?
Don't remind me. I had money on Houston.
Ouch. Hope you didn't lose too much.
The Spurs didn't even have Kawhi or Parker. How could this happen?
Harden was getting shut down by Simmons. He looked lost out there.
And Murray. Where did that guy come from?
You know Pop's system. They put anyone in there and it just works.
But even a late first rounder?
Even Kawhi was a mid first rounder.
True. The Spurs are just a top tier orginization.
Ha! You should've bet on them then!
Can you not?
Who do you have tomorrow? Washington or Boston?
I don't even know. I guess Washington since the home team has won every game so far.
The Wizards players are just bad on the road. Especially Beal. But they thrive at home.
I can't believe he airballed that wide open shot to win the game in game 2.
Too much pressure. He's got it in him but that was a new situation for him. He'll learn.
I just hope it isn't another blowout. The whole play-offs has been filled with them.
You and me both. Hope it's a good, close, low scoring game.
Low scoring game in today's NBA? Yeah, right.
