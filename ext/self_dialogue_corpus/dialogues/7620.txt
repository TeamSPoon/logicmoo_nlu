Do you think Ron and Hermionie were meant to end up together?
Yes, of course! Why, are you a Harry and Hermionie shipper?
Well, it seemed like they were insinuating some sort of love triangle in the last two movies.
Yes, but that was really a departure from the books.
Do you prefer the books to the movies?
For the most part yes, but I am glad they made movies from the series. How about you?
I usually prefer the book the the movies in general but really like the Harry Potter films so it's tough to say.
True, I grew up with the movies so they were a big part of my childhood.
Mine as well. My friends and I would all go to the opening night dressed as wizards.
It's nice that they are rebooting the wizarding world with Fantastic beasts.
