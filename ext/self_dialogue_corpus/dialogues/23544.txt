How do you feel about all the premium movie channels creating TV shows?
I do not think thats what they should do.
But most people dont watch as many movies nowadays they have to do something
Thats not the real reason they create original content.
Why do they do it then?
I think they need a reason to get subscribers.
So the movies they play are not enough to keep people paying?
I think that people do not sit down to watch movies like that anymore.
My own experience, I do not do so.
Yeah see thats what I mean, the model has changed.
I think HBO and Showtime still do a good job
I havent watched a movie on either platform in forever.
You may be a single case though.
The numbers do echo my sentiments as well.
Thats strange because the subscriber rates are through the roof with both.
Yeah because of the original shows they are producing.
They do have more wiggle room.
And no commercials.
I am surprised they havent sold commercials yet.
Why? They pay a premium just to get viewers
