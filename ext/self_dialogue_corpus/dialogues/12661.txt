OK, so favorite Star Wars moment. Go!
OK. Wait, do you mean in the movie, or like, where we were at certain times?
Let's stick to movie moments.
Hmm, OK. I don't know if I have a favorite. There's so many. How about when Lando walks in on Darth and Darth says "I am altering the arrangement. Pray that I do not alter it further."
Ha, yeah, that's a great one. How about when Han and Leia are on Hoth, and she calls him a scruffy, no good nerfherder.
"Who's scruffy looking?" Ha, classic.
You know, I like to use the line "Seems like I'm going nowhere" when someone asks me where I'm going.
Ha, yeah, Luke on Tatooine. Nice. "But I was going to go to Tasha Station and pick up some power converters!"
The whole movie is just full of quotable moments.
Just one long string of them!
