What are your favorite NFL teams?
Well I'm a big Dolphins and Raiders fan.
That is a very interesting combination - why them?
Well I grew up in South Florida and I like the players on the Raiders.
What do you think about the recent movement of the Raiders?
I think it was needed - Las Vegas will be interesting.
Yes, I think so too, that city needed a sports team.
I agree, it is definitely an interesting location for a squad.
I think the Raiders will have another surprise season.
Last season was great before the quarterback went down.
Yes, they were a nice surprise.
And they made the playoffs, too!
Who do you think are the best NFL coaches?
Well I really think Bill Belichick is up there.
Hard to argue against that.
I also think that the Packers coach is pretty great.
Mike McCarthy?
Yes, he is great - as well as Pete Carroll.
I love his South California demeanor.
He seems very laid back.
