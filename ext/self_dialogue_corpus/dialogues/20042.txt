it was the worst in the X men series if you ask me.
No way. it had the best special effects, great story line.
Special effects are not the problem, it's the premise.
Premise that 4 horsemen accompanies the Ancient God mutant? What's wrong with that?
It's a stupid premise. Look at the horsemen what were they...
The dude with the wing,
Yeah the flying guy who gets his wings replaced with some steel wing feather thing. How is he a Horseman of the apocalypse?
Because he can fly and shoot his steel feathers at people.
That's so sophomoric.
What about that chick with light saber arm? That chick was a bad ass.
Maybe if the character was developed more. Though that's true of all the Horsemen. Really the only thing that was sort of bad ass was her jumping off the plane and landing using her light saber arm thing.
And the egyptian girl and Magneto?
I still have no idea what value that egyptian girl brings to the whole genre.
She's Storm. They just decided it to give it a Egyptian twist
See that's kinda retarded.
Did you like anything about the movie?
Magneto was total bad ass. The whole premise that Earth contains magnetic materials and that magneto can harness that is terrifying.
That was pretty good.
The way Jean walks out form the building floating in the air. that was good too.
That was scary good. it felt like I was there looking up at her. Total bad ass.
