What was your favorite grunge band?
I would have to say Nirvana.
Not a bad choice, but I'm a Pearl Jam person myself.
Could never get into Pearl Jam, I mean they are okay, but I liked Nirvana's more agressive style.
You know it's funny I'm partial toward punk and Nirvana was certainly closer to punk than Pearl Jam, but Eddie Vedder seals it for me.
I can see it, guy was and continues to be a great songwriter.
He really is, sometimes don't feel he gets the credit he deserves in that regard.
I wouldn't go that far, he's extremely highly regarded as far as I can see.
I guess it depends on your definition of highly regarded.
I suppose so, but not sure how anyone could feel he deserves more recognition, he gets a pretty large amount as is.
