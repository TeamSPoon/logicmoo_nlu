Did you ever listen to Good Charlotte?
I completely forgot about that band.
I used to be so obsessed with them in high school.
What was your favorite album by them?
It has to be "The Young And The Hopeless".
I think that's everyone's favorite.
After that album they started to get further and further away from their sound.
I agree. That album had so many good songs on it.
I seriously know every word to every single song on it.
I do too. I need to go back and listen to it now.
What was your favorite song on it?
I think my favorite was "The Anthem" but it's hard to say.
That was the song that got me interested in them.
Me too. I remember the first time I heard it.
My favorite was probably "My Bloody Valentine".
I loved that song too.
They actually have a greatest hits album now.
Really? That makes me feel so old.
Yeah, it has 16 songs on it.
It's crazy that a punk rock band had that many hits.
