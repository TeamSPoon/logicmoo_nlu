Have you seen the movie The Witch that came out last year?
Oh yeah, I wanted to see it badly after I saw the trailer
so what do you think
I think it's scary in a total different way, and it has some religious implications to it
oh yeah, what was that?
I think the isolated environment may indicate what would happen to some very devoted religious people if they're separated from the rest of the society
what would happen?
it would drive them crazy
sounds depressing
yeah, that's the underlying tone, not many people noticing it anyway
