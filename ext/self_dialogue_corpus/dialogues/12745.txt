Did you see that really funny scene in the new Episode II movie?
Which one was Episode II?
Episode II is Attack of the Clones.
I actually skipped over that one because it got pretty bad reviews.
It wasn't as bad as everybody made it out to be.
Okay, so what is this funny scene?
It's something that Darth Vader says.
I thought Vader didn't exist in that time?
He does but as an adolescent. He drones on about how much he hates sand!
That's not very befitting of a major villain!
