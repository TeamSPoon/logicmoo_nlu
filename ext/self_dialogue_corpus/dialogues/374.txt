Captain America is an interesting character
I thought he is ok, there are better superheroes out there.
The actor who plays him in the movies is great!
I just think the overall character isnt very interesting
Compared to other superheros, maybe.
Yea, like Superman has a way more interesting story
Yea, and he can fly and use xray vision.
I do like captain americas shield
I want one of those!
I'm sure they sell them on ebay.
