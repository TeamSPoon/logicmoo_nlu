Did you know Tom Petty came through last year.
No. I missed it!
Yeah, me too.
Why didn't you go?
I really wanted to, but I heard tickets we like $200.
That's outrageous!
Yup. Big name like that doesn't have time for the little folk anymore.
Still would have liked to have seen it.
Me too. He's one of my favorites.
Did you know he was in a "Super Group".
No. What was that?
It was called The Travelling Wilburys.
Who was in it.
I think it was Bob Dylan, George Harrison Roy Orbison, and Tom Petty.
Wow!
There was another one, but I can't remeber him.
When did that happen?
I think it was in the 80's.
I'll have to look it up.
You should!
