Do you want to know why I love music so much?
Sure. Why?
Because it can tend to my every mood.
What do you mean?
Music has a way of making me feel certain ways, it plays on my emotions.
Give me an example.
When I feel down and just need a good cry. I can listen to a sad song and reflect emotionally.
That's true.
Or when I am in love and dancing with my partner, I can feel the passion through a good ballad.
I definitely agree with that.
Another example would be when you are feeling patriotic and you hear the song God Bless America.
Yeah. That always has me feeling some strong emotions.
Music is just so great because it can make you feel things just by listening.
Absolutely. Whenever I am in a bad mood, my mom used to play the Lion King soundtrack.
I am sure that made you feel much better right?
It did! It always made me feel more upbeat and like a kid again.
Do you see what I mean? Music tends to our emotions.
It is soulful in a way.
It absolutely is and I love it all.
Me too!
