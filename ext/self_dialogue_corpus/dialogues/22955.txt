Why do you think people complain about all the Fast and The Furious movies?
I think since there are just too many.
But, there are eight Harry Potter Movies.
Yes, in those the story moves along though.
Who do you think played their character the best?
I would go with Ruper Grint.
He played Ron right?
Yes, I think he was pretty much Ron in real life.
I like that those movies dove into what kids are really like.
I do not think many kids can whip up a poly potion in the toilet.
I mean, the friendship they all have.
I see what you mean, and the hardship.
It showed how hard it was to over come things, even for kids.
I like how big the lore was in those movies.
I did too, the magic and history.
I also loved how they made the world seem so real.
When they drink Butter Beer, I can almost taste it.
Do you think the new series will do well?
The Fantastic Beasts one?
Yes, it has a lot of potential to be amazing.
