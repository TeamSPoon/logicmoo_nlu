Hey User 2, I'm looking for a movie for my kids to watch this weekend. Any suggestions?
Are your kids fans of video games?
Video games? Heck, that's all they do these days.
In that case, I would suggest watching "Wreck-it Ralph".
Oh, is that a movie about video games?
Yes, the main character is an arcade game villain, from a game kind of like Donkey Kong.
Donkey Kong? I don't know if my kids will get the reference.
See, that's the great part. The movie has all sorts of references and cameos from video games from the arcade era all the way up to modern games, even some mobile games' characters make an appearance.
Ok, that sounds good. I think my son will like it, but what about my daughter?
One of the protagonists is a girl named Vanellope von Schweetz, whose backstory models her as an inspiration to girls, especially ones who may have encountered bullying.
