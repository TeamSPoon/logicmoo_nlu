I find the best band around right now is Say Anything
What? They have completely changed.
Yeah but their is so much back catalogue.
What is your favorite album?
I think Baseball was their best.
That was a pure rock album but it was written so long ago
And it still holds up today
Yeah but the songs were basic three chord rock tracks.
Is a real boy is their second best.
No way that was a rock opera and clearly their finest work.
They did put out a double album
And some of the songs were filler
They had a lot of featured guests on that album
I believe it was every song having at least one guest spot
But now they dont even have guitars in their song
That was one album, it could change
Do they even have a record label anymore?
Well its just one person nowadays
Yeah see they changed and left the rock genre
No they didnt they just progressed as musicians
