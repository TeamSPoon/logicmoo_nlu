What do you think of Anakin's story in Star Wars?
Oh its so traguc. I felt bad for the Skywalkers.
Mmm hmm. So do you think he was a bad guy?
To be sure, he did go to the dark side. He killed quite a bit.
But you think he's a tragic character.
Yes.  A lot of tragedies were caused by him, and in the end he was redeemed.
I'd say it was hard to see the young, promising Anakin, knowing he'd go astray.
I can see that.
Then events went full circle, and Darth Vader rebelled against the Emperor.
So in one way love ruled the day.
