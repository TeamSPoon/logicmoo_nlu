Do you like Luther Vandross?
I love Luther Vandross! I hate that he died.
Me too, he was one of my favorites.
What's your favorite song by him?
A House is not a Home. That's definitely a well done song.
I love that one but Superstar is my all time favorite of his.
Didn't he remake that from the old Carpenters song?
Yes he did and made it better in my opinion.
That's true. Luther Vandross did a song with Mariah Carey didn't he?
Yes they remade Endless Love by Lionel Richie and Diana Ross.
They did it beautifully. Lionel Richie is another of my favorites.
I love the song Hello by him. And the video is so sweet.
They did that song on a scene in the movie Trolls.
Oh my kids love that movie. It does have a good soundtrack though.
Yes the songs get stuck in your head right away.
Didn't Anna Kendrick voice one of the characters?
The girl from Pitch Perfect? I didn't know that.
Yes she did the speaking and singing voice of Princess Poppy.
Oh that's a fun fact. I loved her in Pitch Perfect.
I'm a fan of Glee so I loved that movie too.
