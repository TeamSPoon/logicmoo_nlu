Have you seen the original Disney Cinderella?
Oh yes, it was one of my favorites as a little girl.
Mine too!  I really love the part where the mice make the dress for Cinderella.
Yeah, that was awesome.  Bibbity, Bobbity, Boo!
Yes, and the depiction of the evil step sisters is great.
I know.  I sing along to all the songs in that movie.
I used to, too!  Now I hear my children singing it while they're watching it.
That's so funny.  Mine do the same thing.
It was really the classic love story.
It was the ultimate princess movie.
