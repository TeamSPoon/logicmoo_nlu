What do you think was the best Beatles Album?
For me it would have to be Let it Be
The last album they made
Well technically it wasnt
Why?
They recorded it before Abbey Road
Thats something new to me
Yeah the Abbey Road sessions were the final work they did together
They seemed to always be releasing records.
Almost 2 a year at one point.
