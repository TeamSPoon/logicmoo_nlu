Do you think Kylo Ren is a good proxy for Darth Vader?
No, he is not even a close second.
You do not like the character?
It is not that I do not like him, it is just that he is not even that bad of a bad guy.
In what way?
Well, he could have killed Rey. He was even sad killing his dad.
Anyone would be, I am sure Anakin was sad killing Obi Wan Kanobi.
He may have been, but SIth lose all their light. Vader was not sad at all.
But Vader gained remorse, so Kylo can have a bit too?
He gained it at death, at the hands of all the light Jedi in his son, Kylo is just weak. He can not even stand up to an officer.
