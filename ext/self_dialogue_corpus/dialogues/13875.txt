Did you know Lady Gaga plays several different instruments?
I know she plays the piano.
She also plays  an acoustic guitar and the drums.
Wow, she is really talented does she play anything else?
Yes, she plays the keytar. She is so musical.
I would love to see her play the drums.
She played all of them on the Howard Stern show. Many people think is was one of her best performances.
Maybe, I will check it out on youtube.
Yeah, it is definitely worth watching, I think you will really enjoy it.
I probably will, I am a huge fan of hers.
