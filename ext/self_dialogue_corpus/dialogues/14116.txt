Do you know where event Lady Gaga wore a dress made from raw beef, now known as the meat dress?
I think it was at an awards show.
Yeah, 2010 MTV Video Music Awards.
I'll bet that was heavy and uncomfortable.
I'll bet it was cold too. They would have to keep it cold so it would not stink.
Oh, yeah. It probably did stink in those hot lights.
She is always coming up with some real attention grabbers.
I heard she works all of the time. She is the type of person that has to create or she gets depressed.
I love to watch her perform she is so amazing.
She has a real talent that is for sure.
