What is the most recent movie you have seen?
I went and watched Everything a few days ago.
I don't think I had ever heard of it.
I hadn't either. I wanted to watch Wonder Woman but arrived late.
So what was it about?
It was about a girl who had an immune issue and she falls in love with a boy.
Sounds like your typical dying girl romance story.
Well, I hadn't really thought about it like that, but yeah, you are right, it does.
So what happens?
I am not going to get into spoilers, but in the end, they end up together.
So how was the acting?
The acting was great; although, I don't recall seeing any of the actors before.
Any big names?
Nope, there wasn't anyone of note in the movie.
So what was the setting?
Just your typical suburban neighborhood.
Does that add anything to the movie?
Nope, this movie was all about the characters.
The question that needs to be asked is, is it worth seeing?
I would highly recommend it if you like those kinds of movies.
