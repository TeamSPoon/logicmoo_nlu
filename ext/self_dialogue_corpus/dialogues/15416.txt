Do you ever listen to popular music on the radio?
Only when my kids turn it on.
Have you heard the song Rock a Bye?
I don't think I have heard that one.  If I did, i probably wasn't listening very closely.
I really love it.
Why?
Well, at first I just liked the sound of it, but I didn't listen to the words.
What about the sound did you like.
I just liked the tune and the rhythm.  The chorus is really catchy, and i like the singer's voice.
Who sings it.
I don't even know.  My kids know though because I ask them to play it for me all the time now.
So, what do you like about it besides the sound?
Well, I love the words now that I know most of them.
What's the song about?
It's a song about a single mom singing to her baby.
Most popular music is about sex and bad relationships.
I know.  This one makes me cry every time because the mom sings to her baby about keeping him safe.
I should give it a listen.  I know you are careful about what you listen to.
You won't be sorry listening to this one.  As a mom, it will touch you to your very core.
What's it called again?  Rockabye?
