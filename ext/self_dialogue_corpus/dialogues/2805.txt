Are you a fan of Cam Newton?
I think he is an alright quarterback.
I think he is very good.
His size gives him a great advantage.
He is a good person on and off the field.
I have heard he does some charity type work.
He does.
I think the best quarterback in the league is Drew Brees.
He is a good player.  I think he is past his prime.
That may be true.
I think he will be slowed down quite a bit this year.
I sure hope not, I really enjoy watching him play.
Are you planning to go to any games?
I haven't decided yet.  How about you?
I usually try to get to one every year.
What game are you thinking this year?
I think I will be going to the Chicago game week three.
That is smart.
Why is that?
Go to Chicago early in the season before it gets cold there.
