So, what's your favorite horror film?
It's hard to say, there's so many I liked, but I think one of them is definitely Nightmare on Elm Street 3.
Oh, yeah, I remember that one!
I think it really raised the bar on the Nightmare films and horror in general, they way they had Freddy's doing all those transformations and stuff.
Well, I remember when he was turned into that giant snake!
Kind of thought it was a worm, myself.
Well, whatever.
But yeah, that was cool!  And the scene where he turns that kid into a puppet.
Oh, man, that was freaking gross!  I remember watching that as a kid, that really turned my stomach!
Your parents let you watch that stuff?
Yeah, they didn't mind me watching crazy horror films as long as I didn't a) wake them up at night or b) there's wasn't a lot of nudity.
Wow, interesting moral standards there.
Yeah, I know, right?
There were some downsides to the movie though.
Oh, what's that?
Well, the whole "Freddy Krueger cracking one liners" thing got started there, and I think the sequels went waaay too far with it.
Yeah, that's kind of true.  They forgot the whole "less is more" kind of thing.
Oh, thought of another, remember the scene where what's her name is running and she's got the little girl in her arms?
Oh, and it turns into a skeleton?
Yeah, that one!  There's a part in that scene, where, even as a kid, I was like "That's a doll!  She's carrying a doll!"
