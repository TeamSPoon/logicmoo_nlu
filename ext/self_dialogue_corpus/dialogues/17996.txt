Hey girl, what's up?
Not much. What about you?
I'm just sitting here thinking about some of the greatest country artists of all time.
Wow that is a tough one. There is so many to consider.
Yeah but I would have to say the top one would have to be George Jones.
Well, he is good but I would not say that he is the top one of all time.
Who would you go with?
No doubt it would be Kenny Rogers.
No way. Just think about all the songs he did with Tammy Wynette.
Yeah those songs with her are good but the ones he did by himself just do no compare to the ones by Kenny Rogers.
What songs are you referring to by Kenny Rogers?
Lady, The Gambler, We've Got Tonight, and of course his version of I Will Always Love You.
Well I'll give it to you those are some good songs but George Jones is at the top of that hill.
What are some of his biggest hits?
White Lightning, She Thinks I Still Care, Why Baby Why, and and of course Hello Darlin.
I must say that Hello Darlin is probably his greatest song but I still don't think that it tops Kenny Rogers' top song.
I guess they both have their good and bad songs.
Yeah but I would still go with Kenny Rogers being the best.
I will have to keep George Jones as my favorite.
This is just one argument that will never get settled.
