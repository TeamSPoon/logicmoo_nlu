Who is your favorite female artist?
Madonna!
I enjoy some of her songs. I will always love her early works like holiday!
That was her first song on the US Billboard Hot 100.
I don't think it ever got to top ten status though.
No her first top ten was Borderline, in the U.S. that is.
Did she have a big hit somewhere else first?
It just has to do with when the songs were released here. It was released before lucky star here.
I loved Lucky star. She wrote that song.
I think she wrote the majority of all her music.
She is such a talent.
Her brother is talented as well. He was her choreographer for years.
Didn't they have some falling out?
Well I think she hired some other choreographer,that may be why.
I think he wrote a tell all book.
I will have to get my hands on a copy.
I am sure there are some great scandalous stories.
Madonna does seem wild at least in her younger years.
She is still feisty.
i suppose she is now dating a  26 year old named Kevin.
