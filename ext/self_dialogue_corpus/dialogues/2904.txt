What are they going to do about the Pro Bowl, man?
Yeah, it used to be a good game, you know?
I remember watching a few years ago and they were taking it so easy.
Yeah, it was kind of a laugh until that one play.
Yeah, I remember that, when the defensive line really went at it...
And the offensive line was just standing there getting smack.
Then they finally started to play some football. Remember?
Yeah, it was kind of funny, I thought.
I understand them not wanting to get hurt but it used to be a real game.
Yeah, you wouldn't want to blow out a knee in the Pro Bowl.
I know I wouldn't want to end my $100 million dollar career on a name that doesn't really mean anything.
It's not like the All Star game in baseball though. Nothing's riding on it.
Wonder if they could do anything about that?
First possession in the Super Bowl for the conference that wins the Pro Bowl maybe.
I guess that's something but not really much.
I bet if they paid them better even that wouldn't make a difference.
I have to agree with you there.
The Pro Bowl's kind of like preseason but your job's not on the line.
That's a good way of thinking of it. Never occurred to me.
I only just now thought of it.
