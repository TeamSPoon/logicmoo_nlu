What is your favorite Harry Potter Movie?
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 for sure! I loved every bit of it!
What did you think of everything that transpired with Snape?
It was heartbreaking for sure! I love that we got to see his story from beginning to end, and see how he really was.
It was really sad. He is my favorite character.
Mine too. He is so complicated and diverse!
I do hate that so many characters had to die. Tonks, Fred Wesley, Lupin and Snape.
I know! Such great characters got killed off, making it so emotional!
I love the Harry Potter series. It is my favorite ever!
Mine too! Such an amazing stories, with some of the best characters ever!
