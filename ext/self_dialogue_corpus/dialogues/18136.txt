What do you think of opera music?
I like opera sometimes, but I haven't heard a lot of good stuff.
Most people haven't, even I haven't.
What did you have in mind when you asked?
I was wondering if you've heard any of the music from The Phantom of the Opera.
Not really, what's it like?
Oh wow, it's so good!
What's so good about it?
Each song just flows so nicely and has such a memorable melody.
That sounds cool, I like that.
I'm sure you'd love all the music in there.
Is it a movie?
There is a movie rendition of the play, but the music came from the play originally.
Is the movie version any good?
Yes, I think it probably has the best recorded versions of all the songs.
Wow, that's a pretty good compliment.
It deserves it. The main girl's voice is so gentle and pleasing, and the Phantom's is very suiting for his character.
That sounds like it'd be fun to listen to.
I have the soundtrack if you want to borrow it.
Sure, let me borrow it over the weekend and I'll get back to you.
