The Wizard of Oz was a real classic film
I know, I liked that each character was missing something and had to find it
they had to get it from the wizard
like the lion needed a brain and the Tin man needed a heart
and Dorthy had to get home somehow
the ruby red slippers were so pretty
they were, remember the bad witch had them on when she was under the house?
yes, that part was crazy, the good witch was pretty
I wish I could find a yellow brick road
There was something really magical about that movie
