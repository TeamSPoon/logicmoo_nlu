Did you see the Pirates and Nationals game yesterday?
No, who won?
The Pirates won 10-4. It was a great game.
Did Bryce Harper have any hits?
Yes, I believe he got 2 hits.
Wow. He is supposed to get a really big contract next year.
I know. I wonder if the Nationals will keep them.
He is going to ask for over 400 million dollars.
Do you think they will pay him?
It depends on whether they have the money.
I'm sure that won't be a problem. I hope they keep Ryan Zimmerman too.
He has been having a great season so far.
I agree, even at his old age.
How old is he now?
I think he is in his late 30's. Most of his time was spent in the minor leagues.
Wow, that is a great story.
When is the next game?
I am not sure. I am going to watch the Red Soz and Athletics tonight.
Who do you think will win?
The Red Sox look good this week.
