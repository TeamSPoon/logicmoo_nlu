Lady Gaga is one of my favorite singers.
I think her music is a little too childish for me.
Not at all.  She is amazingly talented.
You think so?
Absolutely.  She sings, dances, writes, and plays her own instruments.
I didn't know that she did all of that.
She is a creative mastermind.  Her early stuff on youtube is so impressive.
I've never thought to watch it.
You should.  It will make you see her in a different light.
I think I'll do that.  Thanks for telling me.
