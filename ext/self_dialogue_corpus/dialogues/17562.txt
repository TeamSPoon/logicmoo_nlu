Do you have a favourite Newsboys song?
I don't know, it used to be Entertaining Angels, but I kind of like Take Me To Your Leader.
I love the creative writing on that one.
Yeah, it took me years before I made the connection of what he was trying to say with the names.
I feel that way about the puns in "Breakfast".
I know what you mean. I miss the old Newsboys.
You don't like them now with Michael Tait?
I didn't even care for them before that. I thought the last album they put out before changing lead singers wasn't even that creative.
Yeah, the songs were definitely more original and funny when they started out.
Yeah, now they're just trying to sell in mainstream Christian markets.
They used to be so unapolagetic in a witty and confrontational way.
Like with "I'm Not Ashamed" and "God is Not a Secret".
Exactly. I wish more artists were honest about when it's time to throw in the towel.
They still have to make a living.
I'm sure Peter Furler had made enough money at that point that he didn't need to worry about that.
You're probably true.
I guess I take it kind of personally because that was like my favourite band growing up and to see it take a turn for the worse makes me sad.
I don't blame you. They put out a lot of high quality stuff though.
Yeah. And they are all getting older and evolving, I can't expect them to stay the same forever.
Just keep enjoying their older stuff that's still good.
