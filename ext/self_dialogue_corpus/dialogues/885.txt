So something i've always wondering.
What is that?
Well, when Field Goals are kicked, If you are in a stadium, even unenclosed, where does the wind come from that pushes the ball.
I've thought of something like that. i can see it in unenclosed stadiums but in an enclosed stadium it should not happen.
But i have seen games in enclosed stadums where it HAS happened.
Oh, at least 2 or 3 times last seson alone i saw it on TV.
It is definately strange.
I'm sure there is some kond of air flow in both kind of stadiums just so fans and players can breathe but to make a ball move?
Well, think how much force you would need to force air thru aa 60,000 seat stadium.
I presumed it was done in sections.
i honestly do not know.
hm.... something we should look up.
I guess the question is how do kickers and punters DO make it with breezes and air flow.
Well, other than LOTS of practice they watch the flags on the goal post to look for breeze.
True, you see them adjust a lot.
I also see a lot of balls curving real close to the end zone but straight and true up until that point.
Yeah, that always puzzles me.
Could be just the knetic energy fading out from the kick.
You think?
It's a possibility.
