So is Justin Bieber the king of pop at this point?
He has some good tunes, but what about Bruno Mars?
Good point - "That's What I Like" and "Versace on the Floor" are great new songs.
His voice is the best, especially on "When I Was Your Man" and "It Will Rain".
"Unorthodox Jukebox" was fantastic from top to bottom.
He's an underrated dancer too, and he even plays a mean guitar!
That's right, I saw him cover Prince's "Let's Go Crazy" at the Grammys.
Bruno is about the only current artist who could have pulled that off.
He would be such a fun concert to go see.
For sure, we'll have to go check him out when he's in town.
