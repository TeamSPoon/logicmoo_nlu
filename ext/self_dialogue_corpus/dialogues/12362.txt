What do you think of the storm troopers in Star Wars?
Totally awesome. I thought they were really bad dudes.
No lady storm troopers?
Not in the original three, but I think there are some in Force Awakens.
Yeah, that's right. The silver looking one.
Captain Phasma I believe.
I really liked the snow ones in Empire
Oh yeah, those ones were awesome.
Yeah, they had capes and extra accessories.
Yeah, I thought those were so cool when I was kid.
