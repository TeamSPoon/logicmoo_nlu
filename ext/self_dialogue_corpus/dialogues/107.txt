So, who is the best Batman of all time?
For my money, I'll say Michael Keaton is the best Batman, but the Christian Bale trilogy are the best Batman movies.
I can agree with that.  Who was the better Joker, Jack or Heath?
It's really hard to say-- both really nailed the role in different ways.  I'll say Heath Ledger, because his role is so iconic now.
What about the best Catwoman?
I'll say that every Catwoman but Halle Berry is tied for first place, because that Catwoman movie was the worst thing to ever happen.
Do you know what would be really cool?  If they could do an Avengers/Justice League crossover in the movies.
I don't ever see movie executives putting aside their egos long enough for that to happen, but it would make all the money in the world.
Yeah, it would be amazing-- Superman on screen with Captain America, Batman with Iron Man.
It would be amazing, no doubt.  I wonder who the villain would be?
