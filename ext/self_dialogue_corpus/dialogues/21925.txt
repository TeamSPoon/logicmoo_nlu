What do you think about the Hunger Games movies?
I love them! I like Jennifer Lawrence is great.
I agree. She's awesome.
Althought I never got the idea that she was really torn between the two guys.
I don't think that was her fault. I think that was the writing.
Yeah, I agree.  I never thought that Liam Hemsworth was really in contention.
Yeah, Peta or however you spell it was in SO many more scenes and they never really showed her thinking about the other guy.
And when he builds the weapon that kills her sister! I mean really, you know she isn't going back to him.
I agree.  But I actually felt less like she was in love with Peta than that they had bonded over suffering.
I think that's the best she could get after all she went through.
The end was a suprise for me!  I never thought that she was going to kill Julianne Moore.
I agree! I thought she's expose her but not kill her.
That was pretty rough.
And when they go after the other President in the end.  I thought he'd live.
No, I never thought he'd live.
I loved the costumes!
Oh yeah! That dress that goes up in flames is fantastic.
That would be a great halloween costume, minus the flames.
But I don't like the bow and arrow outfit.
Well, what can you expect.  It's suppossed to be pratical.
