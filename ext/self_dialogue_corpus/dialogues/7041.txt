Can you recommend a good Disney movie for me?
Yes, Peter Pan.
I've never seen that one.
It is pretty old, but it is an iconic Disney movie.
What happens in it?
Peter takes Wendy and her family to Neverland.
What happens there?
Peter fights the wicked Captain Hook.
Oh, that sounds awesome.
Yeah, and there is an alligator that lives in the water. He is scary.
