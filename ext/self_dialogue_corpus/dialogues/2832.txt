Are you planning on going to any Buffalo Bills games this year?
Maybe, I don't know yet.
Are you excited for the new season?
Not really, I'm still kind of burned out from last season.
What makes you say that?
I'm just sick of this team.
So are you just done with them?
I wouldn't say that with any certainty.
Don't you think that the Bills have a chance to go to the playoffs this year?
Not at all.
I can't believe you have given up.
I've been a fan for almost thirty years, and they let me down every single year.
I understand your frustration.
LeSean McCoy is the only great player they have, and we still don't have a good quarterback.
Yes, it's been a long time since we had stable play at that quarterback position.
It's just getting to the point where I look at the Bills and the NFL as businesses that want to take my money.
Well I still have fun and enjoy them.
That's good, but I have a tough time when they don't provide me with any tangible results or services for my money.
That's funny, maybe you shouldn't follow the team or the league anymore.
I have felt this way for close to ten years, and this year might be the year I stop watching or supporting.
