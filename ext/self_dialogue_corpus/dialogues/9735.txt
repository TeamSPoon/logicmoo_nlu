Do you listen to very much rap that's political in nature?
Not really—is there political rap?
Absolutely! Some of the earliest stuff that was commercially released has political messages.
Like what songs?
Well, "The Message" by Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five. It came out in the early 80s.
Old school.
Totally. But it's really interesting—all about the plight of the inner cities in the early 1980s. Has a lot of really interesting social commentary, not just good rhymes.
Grandmaster Flash? Isn't he also a DJ?
Oh yeah, he's awesome. So amazing at scratching and cutting and he wasn't even using a laptop of anything! You should check out the movie Wild Style for some of this old school style.
Will do!
