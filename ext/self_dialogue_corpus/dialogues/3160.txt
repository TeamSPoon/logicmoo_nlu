Are you excited for the Dallas Cowboys this season?
I dont know, Tony Romo wont be playing.
Oh that doesnt matter, Dak Prescott will be great!
Yea but can he lead his team?
Of course he can, didnt you see last season? He was great.
Yea but that was only 1 year, he might have a softmore slump?
No way he is a born leader.
How do you know?
Look at his college experience, he was great.
He also had a great running back in Ezekiel Elliot
Yes Elliot is awesome, he will be great again
Of course, thats if he stays out of trouble
Yea thats true
How is their defence this year?
I think its gonna be better than last year?
No way, they lost so many cornerbacks to free agency
Yea but they will just replace them
That does not give me confidence
You might be right about that
Well their offence will probably make up for it
