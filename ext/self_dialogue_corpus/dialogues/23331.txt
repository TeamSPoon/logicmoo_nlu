Do you like all movies?
I do, what about to you?
Same here, there's so many genres and actors,
There's definitely something for everyone
There sure is, Noone is disappointed when it comes to movies.
Nope there is old westerns, action, drama, comedy, thrillers, fantasy, scifi.
Even documentary movies
Yea, I don't watch those.
Me either, they are so boring to me.
They are, I don't understand how people can sit through those.
I dont either.
Maybe if someone is really I teres Ted in the person.
Yea, I watched a movie on Jeffrey Dahmer one time, I guess that was like a documentary.
Sounds like it if it was about his life.
That one wasn't too bad, it was kind of interesting.
Uea I guess it depends on the type, because that sounds interesting.
I can't just want any documentary though.
Nope, never, I can not sit through them.
I wonder what kind of people do
Ones that have boring hobbies
