Do you think the Patriots will repeat as Super Bowls winners this year?
As a Patriots fan, I'd like to think so.
But in your unbiased opinion?
Well, we will have to see. They play some good teams this year.
Yeah, but they don't have that hard of a schedule.
I think their strength of schedule is twelfth, but that doesn't really mean much before the season starts.
Fair, but who are they playing that you are worried about?
Worried may not be the right word. Apprehensive though; the Chiefs, Texans, Falcons, Broncos, and Steelers for sure.
I don't know. Texans still don't have their quarterback situation figured out. Maybe the Falcons only because they have something to prove.
Exactly. And the Steelers game is away and it isn't easy to play in Pittsburgh.
As much as I hate to admit it, I just don't see anyone in the league who will be able to touch them this year.
Once we get to post season though, I imagine we will face the Raiders and they will be tough this year.
Oh, that's right. They got Marshawn Lynch didn't they.
Yes. And I can't imagine they will throw the ball on the one yard line if they can run it with him.
That couldn't be a reference to Super Bowl 49 could it?
You think? It should be a good year all around.
I know. I'm excited for it. I think the Eagles may be able to step it up this year.
Maybe for the first four or five games just to give their fans some hope.
And then go back to being the Eagles and crush all hope for the remainder of the season?
Exactly! August just needs to get here.
