Who is hosting the Super Bowl this coming season?
They are actually having it in Minnesota.
Minnesota? Are you kidding me?
Yes, they have a new dome!
Really? When was that built?
I think it was just built for the Vikings this past year.
That's great, but I really love an outdoor NFL game.
Me too, especially in the snow.
Yes, I think those are the best football games.
I don't think any games should be played in a dome.
Not even when it's 20 below zero?
Not even then!
Football is such a brutal sport, they should be able to withstand the weather.
Well, I think the players can, it's just the fans can't.
True fans will withstand the weather.
I think there is some good to come from having a dome.
Yes, probably good if you want to take kids to the game.
Yes, my kids love the games but it can get so bitterly cold that we have to leave.
Yes, probably eventually all NFL teams will play in a dome.
It seems like that is the trend.
