I am going to see Alien Covenant tonight.
Really?  I am always afraid to see those types of movies.
I am not, Alien trilogy is my favorite movies of the world!
What is the story line in this one?
Bound for a remote planet on the far side of the galaxy, members (Katherine Waterston, Billy Crudup) of the colony ship Covenant discover what they think to be an uncharted paradise.
Sounds like the team finds trouble pretty fast after they go to the remote planet.
Basically, yes.  And they have an android to thank for creating the alien species.
What a surprise twist!
I probably shouldn't have told you that!
I agree! But I will not go by myself , it is frightening!
The aliens are different in this movie.  They show the evolution of it to the current line of them.
It amazes me how fast the creature gestates in the human host.
it only takes  a few days and then it splits them open and emerge as full alien.
Who stars in the movie?
Katherine Waterson, Michael Fassbender, Noomi Racape are the main characters.
Who is the director again?
Ridley Scott, who else?
Ah, I see you like Ridley.
I wish I could work under him, that would be phenomenal.
He seems very creative.
