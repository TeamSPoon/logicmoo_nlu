Did you see the new Guardians of the Galaxy movie?
Yes, are you kidding? We went together.
Oh...right. Awkward. Anyway, how would you compare that to the first?
I thought that this movie had a better villain overall than the first, but the silliness was overwhelming.
How so?
Well, everything was a massive joke. It's fine at times, but here the epicness was brought down by the humor.
Yeah, I can see that, but the characters were better.
I disagree, of course. Gamora's character was completely misused.
Why do you say that?
Because I felt that way, silly. And because she wasn't used in the plot; she just fought her sister until they agreed not to anymore.
Yeah, that was a bit odd. I see that now.
I'm glad you do. What did you like most about it?
I loved baby Groot! He's so cute.
You're such a child. Groot did nothing the whole movie except dance during an action movie.
No, he caught the one bad guy and threw him off the bridge.
You're saying a baby tree flat-out murdering someone is fine because he's cute?
You like ruining movies, don't you?
I should work at CinemaSins.
What are you  most looking forward to going forward?
Well, Star-Lord saw the whole universe and now has infinite knowledge that doesn't go away now that he's no longer a god. How will he use that in the final Marvel movies?
