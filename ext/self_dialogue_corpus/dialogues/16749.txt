You know now that I'm in my 60's I just can't seem to keep up with all the new music and artists that are out there.
I know what you mean.  I feel the same way.
I find that I don't listen to any of the new stuff because I don't like it much.  There are a few songs that I like.
Like what?
Well, there was this song that a radio station played and I never heard who sung it.  I was so frustrated.
Did you ever find it?
Yes, I did.  I thought it sort of sounded like Justin Timberlake.  I searched on the internet and found it.  I play it a lot.  I like it.
What is it?
It's called, "I can't stop the feeling" by Justin Timberlake.
Oh, yeah I love that song !!
I know, it is really catchy and makes you want to get up and dance.
Have you seen the video yet?
Yes!!  I think the video is neat.  All the people dancing, even people that are my age are in the video.  Which I think is neat.
Yeah they did a good job of putting all the different people in the video and then at the end they all come together and dance.
Even in my "older" age I can still get into that type of music.  I guess that's not all bad.
I think it shows that you are still young at heart.  Music helps lift the mood and makes you feel better.  Don't you think so?
Yes, I do.  I especially like to listen to praise and gospel music.  Now that will really lift me when I'm down and blue about life and circumstances that seem overwhelming.
Any certain artist you like in that genre?
Yes, there are many, but I really find that the Hosanna Integrity music which has different artists really sooths me when I need it.
That's great I will have to check into that too.
