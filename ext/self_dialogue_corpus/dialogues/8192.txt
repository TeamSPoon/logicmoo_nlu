Have you heard any of Harry Styles' new music?
The guy from OneDirection?
Yeah.  He went solo.
I'm not really into him, but I think I heard one of his new songs.
What was it?
I don't know, but I think it was written with Taylor Swift.
Oh yeah, I love that one!
I didn't care for it much.
Were you a fan of One Direction?
No, so maybe that's why I didn't like this song.
