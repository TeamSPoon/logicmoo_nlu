Have you seen any good movies lately?
I just watched the second John Wick movie.
Oh? How was it? I liked the first one.
You know, it was pretty much just 2 hours of Keanu Reeves killing people.
Well, that was pretty much the first movie, too.
Yeah, but it seemed like it was gratuitous. There was very little else going on.
There was no plot?
Oh, there was, I guess. Instead of killing over his dog, he was killing over his car, and then his house.
I guess he really liked his car.
Yeah, but i don't know that it necessarily warrants slaughtering like fifty people. and his car is totalled in the process anyway.
Were there any memorable deaths?
He killed a couple of guys with a pencil. Those were particularly graphic.
A pencil? Like a number 2?
Yep. Apparently it wasn't the first time either. The stories about him are "watered down", says one character.
That is pretty sweet.
He seems superhuman. He gets pretty badly injured and is still out there killing people with ease.
Adrenaline is a really powerful thing, even for people who aren't assassins.
Sure, I agree, but that can only sustain you for so long. After that, it has to be something more.
It's his sheer force of will, then. There's a reason the movie is named after him and not one of his victims.
Well, everyone he killed was probably not a 'victim', they were all in the underworld already.
