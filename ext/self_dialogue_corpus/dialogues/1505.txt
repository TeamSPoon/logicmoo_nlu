This NFL offseason has been interesting.
Yeah there have been some surprises and a lot of teams seemed poised to make it a competitive year.
There is one move that has me confused. Joe Montana comparing Colin Kepernick's situation to Tim Tebow.
What did he say?
He said that it was his subpar completion percentage that did him in.
That's not fair Tebow had a forty something percent completion rate and Kapernick was mid to high fifties.
Right. So Tebow we understand. You can't make it long in the NFL with those numbers.
Kapernick's completion percentage is better than some starting quarter backs.
Exactly. So why is he not signed?
OK. So the owners are saying it's the fans. They don't want him.
He has apologized to the league and stated that he will stand for the National Anthem going forward and he still isn't signed.
Do you think he's been blacklisted?
It seems that way. That and his performance.
So he isn't winning enough to make his not so distant past go away.
I think so. I've heard he also will only sign if he is going to start.
The only team that would be desperate enough to pick him up is the Jets.
They haven't even spoken to him and they are about to make the Cleveland Browns look good this season.
Maybe this is it for him in the NFL. I heard the Cubs drafted him out of highschool.
So maybe he is just like Tebow and he can go play baseball.
America's favorite past time may not appreciate him.
