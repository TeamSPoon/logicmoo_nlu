What is your favorite thriller?
I always liked Joy Ride.  I know it's older, but I always love watching it.
That's the one with Paul Walker right?
Yes.  I thought it kept me on edge the entire movie.
I liked Paul Walker in the Skulls.  That was a good thriller too.
Which one do you like better?
Definitely the Skulls.
I think the Skulls is a good mix of mystery and thriller.
It is.  Have you seen The Hunger Games?  That's kind of a triller.
I have.  I thought the books were so much better though.  The directors could have done a much better job making the movies more thrilling.
