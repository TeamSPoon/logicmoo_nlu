Hey do you like Kenny G?
Who is Kenny G?  Is he that guy that plays a saxaphone?
Yes, that's who I'm talking about.
I've heard some of his music, but not much
Oh, that's too bad.  I absolutely LOVE his music.  He is so talented.
Why do you like him so much?
Well, I have a lot of fond memories playing his music because my husband and I like to listen to it together.
I'm not all that interested in saxaphone music
What about jazz music in general, do you like any jazz?
Some jazz is ok, but I guess it's not my choice of music.
Well, what is your favorite type of music?
I enjoy quite a few types of music
Name some that I might know.
I like soft rock and oldies.
Oh, yes I like oldies too.  Especailly from the 60's and 70's.
Yes, I also like musice from the 50's and even some from the 40's.
Oh, you know I have been listening to some music by Frank Sinatra and I really like his music.
My parents used to listen to his music, so I'm somewhat familar to it.
I found a song by Frank Sinatra that is so my husband's and my kind of song.  It's called 'Time after Time".   It is a love song.
Oh, I will have to check that song out.
