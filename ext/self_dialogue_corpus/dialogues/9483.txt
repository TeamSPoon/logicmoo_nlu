Who's your favorite hip-hop star?
Uh... Puff Daddy?
Puff Daddy? You know he hasn't gone by that name in something like ten years
Which tells you how big a fan of Hip-Hop I am.
Hip Hop is cool. You should give it a chance.
Nope. I won't pay someone to cuss at me and tell me how I should go out and have sex with sluts and kill cops. No way.
Very, very few hip-hop songs talk about killing cops.
Guess how many country songs talk about killing cops?
All country songs are about trains, trucks and your woman leaving you.
Hey, at least they're not killing cops or doing coke or screwing hoes.
