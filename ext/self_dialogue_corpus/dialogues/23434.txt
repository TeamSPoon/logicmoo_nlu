Do you want to go see the Pirates of the Caribbean movie with me?
With you, no.
Ouch. How about at all?
Nope, I have no interest.
Why not? You love swashbuckling adventures.
No, I really don't. They are silly.
Don't you have a couple of them on DVD?
I used to, but they're in storage and I haven't watched them in years.
Why the change of heart?
Well, I got older. They're clearly catered for children.
Do you like Johnny Depp?
I like how devoted he is to his character, but the character has grown thin on me.
Well, I'd like to see it.
You know the reviews are crap, right?
Really?
Yeah, something like 35% on Rotten Tomatoes.
What did the last one get?
About the same.
Well, maybe I'll wait for Redbox. That's a bit low.
Good choice!
