Do you like the Beatles?
Kind of.
What do you mean?
I mean, I like some of their songs. Like Across The Universe and Blackbird. But I just never really listened to them.
You should really give their albums a try! A lot of their music is on Spotify.
I might check out some of their stuff. Are you a big fan or something?
Definitely. I pretty much grew up listening to The Beatles.
How'd you even find them? They were popular before you were born.
Yeah, but my dad was really into them. He's the one that got me into them in the first place.
That's cool. Maybe he had some of their old records then.
