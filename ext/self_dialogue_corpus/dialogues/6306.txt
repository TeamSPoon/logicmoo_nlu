Have your kids watched all of the Disney Classics like, Snow White, Fantasia, or Bambi?
They've watched a few but not all, the kids don't care for the graphics because they're not like todays movies.
What's the last movie they watched from Disney?
Aladdin and they loved it.
I just watched Alice in wonderland and they loved it, I think the fact that theres a lot of singing in it.
I should try and watch that with them, I think they would compare it to the remake.
Let's make a movie night and watch PInnochio or Jungle Book with them.
That sounds great! we could make a night of it Jungle book is actually quite funny especially the monkey king.
Perfect and then next weekend we could watch Sleeping Beauty and Cinderella.
Sleeping Beauty is my ultimate favorite Disney Movie.
