What good movies have you seen lately?
One movie that really messed with my mind is The prestige.
Oh, isn't that the movie about the magician duel?
yeah, that's one way to put it. I just love Christopher Nolan movies man.
My wife called The prestige a movie between batman and Wolverine in an alternate universe.
Seeing Christian Bale as anyone but batman is hard, he really is an embodiment of Batman.
His work in other movies aren't as great, I think that Leonardo Dicaprio plays Christopher Nolan movies well.
What other movies has he been in?
Inception was a classic and Shutter Island was another one.
Inception truly was terrifying, not knowing whether he's in reality or not.
