Have you ever seen any of the Psycho movies?
I've seen some.  I don't know if I've seen all of them.
Did you know that they turned the movies into a series?
No.  Did they?
Yeah, it lasted a few seasons, but it just ended.
Oh, what was the name of it?
It was called Bates Motel.
It follows the same story line?
Actually, it shows why Normal turned into a crazy person.
Oh, that sounds interesting!
