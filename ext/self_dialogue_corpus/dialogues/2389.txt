So isn't it weird that the Rams are in Los Angeles now?
Yeah, it seems like they should still be in St. Louis.
When I was a kid, they moved to St. Louis, and it seems wasteful that they moved back again.
I know, but I'm sure it has to do with money.
Oh yeah, someone is getting very rich off the deal.
Have you seen the temporary stadium that they are playing in?
Yes, it doesn't quite look NFL-level, but I know they are constructing a new state-of-the-art stadium.
It will probably be crazy how modern it is.
Yeah, the new fields are just insane with how different they look.
The one that just opened up in Minnesota is very futuristic-looking.
Yes that one is nice, but I like the one in San Francisco that they built for the 49ers.
Oh yeah, that stadium is unique.
So now it seems that the Raiders are leaving Oakland for Las Vegas.
Yes, I heard that crazy news.
So they will have to build a new stadium in Las Vegas for when they move.
Can you imagine what it will look like?
No, but since it is Vegas and the Raiders, I bet it will be very attention-grabbing.
They will have a one-of-a-kind place for sports entertainment.
I agree, and they'll have no problem filling it to capacity with tons of fans.
It will be an event, that's for sure, but ticket prices probably will be astronomical to get in there.
