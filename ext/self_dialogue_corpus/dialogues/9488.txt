Remember when Eminem first came out?
Of course! I was a huge fan and still am.
I remember how different his song "The real Slim Shady" was. So weird.
It was definitely different.
He was like a brand new rapper though. His music was so different.
Yes! I still listen to his music today.
I do too at times.
I also enjoyed his movie "8 Mile".
Wasn't that based on his actual life?
Yes I believe it was.
