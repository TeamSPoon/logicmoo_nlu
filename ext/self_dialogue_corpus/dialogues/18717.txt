What kind of music are you into?
I know it sounds cliche, but just about everything.
Even country?
Haha, yeah it's ok.  It's usually cheesy and corny, but sometimes, it can be sweet and endearing.
What about techno?
Ok, you got me there-- I think that's pretty awful.
Rap?
I don't listen to a lot of rap, but the rap I do like, I love.  I still consider Blackout one of my favorite albums of all time.
Who is that?
Method Man and Redman.
Are they in the Wu Tang Clan?
Method Man is.
Do you like classical?
Certain songs-- like I'd be bored at a symphony because I typically like songs with lyrics, but I love the Superman theme for example.
Do you like rock?
Yeah, I'd say rock is what I listen to the most?
What are some of your favorite rock bands?
Pink Floyd, the Beatles, the Rolling Stones.
Do you like rap-rock?
You mean like Limp Bizkit?  I refuse to believe that anyone could've ever liked that.
