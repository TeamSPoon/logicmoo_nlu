Yo, Johnny, you gonna watch Coco?
What up Big Steve, what is that like fashion or something?
Nah dawg, its some straight up, incredible visual, Cinco de Mayo theme movie man!
For real? That sounds trippy!
Yeah man, its lit. The trailer is lit, awesome trailer man!
Ooooo, I gotta see it. I'll bring my homies, and my boys, and my family.
Yeah man, in the Coco movie, the boy was running around in the spirit realm, so beautiful!
Yeah man, I heard you the first time.
This movie is going to be the popping Disney movie of 2017.
For sure man, I hope its good. I'm buying my whole family movie tickets.
