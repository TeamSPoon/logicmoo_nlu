Why did they decide to change the fighting style in the prequels?
You mean from Samurai style to Chinese style?
Is that what that's supposed to be?
yes. Chinese style has more movements making it look flashy.
Yeah, guess that makes the light saber moves more dramatic.
Way more dramatic, but also a lot more woirk, but that's made possible with better computers.
Yep.
You know whatI think it owuld've been cool?
What?
You know how Anakin goes and kills all the jedi kids? I think his blade should've turned red or at least purple. And totally red by the time he battles Kenobi
