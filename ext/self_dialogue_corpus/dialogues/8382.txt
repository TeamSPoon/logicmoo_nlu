I really like Twenty One Pilots.
How many people are in that band?
There are two.
Two people in a band?
Yep.  One is the drummer.  The singer plays everything else.
Like what?
Piano, mostly.  But he also plays guitar and even a ukele.
Cool.  I thought they were kind of religious.
Not really.  They have thought provoking songs that make people think it's preachy.
I'm going to have to try them out. Thanks!
