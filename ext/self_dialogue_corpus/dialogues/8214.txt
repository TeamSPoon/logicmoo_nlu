What do you like about pop music?
It's fun and more upbeat.
I agree. What do you dislike?
Mostly the auto tune and lack of real musical ability.
That's what I dislike too. I hate auto tune.
It makes the singers sound robotic.
A lot of the time it does, yes.
I can always hear it even if it's used sparingly.
I think pop was better before it came along.
I agree. The singers had to go on their own merrits.
