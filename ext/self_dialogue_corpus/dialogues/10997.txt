This is hard to watch!
Yeah, that goalie's on a long scoreless streak.
They've got all the defensive power. Look at that Havoc!
See that? Yeah, he's plenty of trouble.
Wow, look at our Killam. He slammed that guy right into the  shield.
Good work!
Go, go go. Look. Wohovick avoided the check!
Yeah! Point shot!
And he stopped it.
Next time. Next time. Come on, come on.
Oh no, offsides. He was about to pull the trigger, too.
Yeah, and now they got another one.
That's it. We never even touched them.
The odds did have us as the underdogs.
At least our guys gave them a battle. That stupid manager...
We  tried.
Yeah, somewhat. If they'd just trade a few.
Yeah. I don't know why  I keep coming.
I do love the Shark Tank though. It's got a great bar.
Too bad it's closed. Lets go over to the High Life.
