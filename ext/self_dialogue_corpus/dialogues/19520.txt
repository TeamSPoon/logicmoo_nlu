So you like Avenged Sevenfold, right?
I don't listen to them that much, but yeah.
Do you prefer their old or new style?
Their old style. I was actually a fan back then.
I guess that means that Waking the Fallen is a favorite for you?
You're right. It's actually still one of my favorites.
What did you like about that album?
I just liked the sound of it. It was more polished and refined than their debut.
Favorite song?
I'd have to say Unholy Confessions.
You know that they still play stuff from that album live, right?
I could've guessed, but I don't imagine it sounds the same.
You should take the time to look up some recent footage.
But the singer doesn't even scream anymore.
That shouldn't matter. I know what I'm telling you.
Well how recent, then?
Literally during this year. They still perform Unholy Confessions as a closer.
Do they play any others?
From Waking the Fallen? They do actually play songs like Chapter Four and Second Heartbeat sometimes.
Okay then. I'll check it out.
