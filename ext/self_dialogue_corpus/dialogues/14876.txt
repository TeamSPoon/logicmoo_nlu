If you had to only watch one comedy movie for the rest of your life, what would it be?
Umm...probably Zoolander.
Haha! Excellent choice!
Yea, Zoolander is such a classic. I honestly don't think I've seen a more original and outrageous comedy.
Yea, like the whole concept of the movie is so incredibly stupid but so brilliantly smart at the same time.
I love it how Will Ferrell was in that movie before he was super famous. It's funny to re watch it and see him play Mugatu.
Yea, he was hilarious!
Did you see the second Zoolander movie?
Yea...not a fan. It was basically just a sad attempt to copy the first.
Yea, it felt like it was a parody of the first movie.
