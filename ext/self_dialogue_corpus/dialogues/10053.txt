I can't wait to see the new Star Wars movie.
What is the title going to be?
The Last Jedi.
I am assuming that Mark Hamill will be reprising his role again.
Yes, he will play Luke again, but from the trailers he seems a bit darker.
How do you mean?
The trailer shows him fearing that the Jedi's time is over with.
Well, everything must end at some point.
I hope that this isn't the last Star Wars film because the franchise is so great.
I hope so too. There are so many memorable characters.
