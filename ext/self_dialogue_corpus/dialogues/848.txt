I can't wait for the NFL to start!
Yeah, It is going to surely be exciting!
Do do think the Pats can pull it off again?
That is a great question. They surely loaded up the Brinks Truck!
The dude they pulled in from New Orleans is going to be dynamite!
He might even be a reasonable facsimile of Randy Moss.He name is Brandin Cooks. Fast!
Well, how about some of the other teams in the AFC? How do you like Carr, and the Raiders.
I think they are a real threat as long as he stays healthy.
That was just a freak injury he'll be fine.
It just shows how valuable he is. Without him, the Raiders got blown out in the playoffs.
The steelers will always be tough. Timeline always seems to get those guys to play.
Agreed! They got some young guys on defense. The guys they had last year just couldn't get it done.
They drafted Watt's little brother and Cameron Sutton, a cornerback from Tennessee. They will be a lot better right there.
Well, it won't be enough to overtake the Patriots.They loaded up on defense too.
They picked up LB Harris from the Jets, and he was really good last year. They also scooped up Stephon Gilmore from Buffalo.
I know, they gave him 15M a year.Bet that has to make Malcolm Butler Happy. He is playing for under 4M this year.
Well, he will get his payday next year.All of the good ones do!
God, we didn't even have time to talk about the NFC!
They will be interesting too this year. Green Bay and Dallas look dominant!
The back from Dallas has only been in the league for a year.It seems like he is in a little trouble.
