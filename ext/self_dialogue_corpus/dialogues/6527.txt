Did you hear about the little short feature film based on the Disney movie Frozen that's coming out in November?
No, what's it called?
Olaf's Frozen Adventure. It's only 21 minutes long, but it sounds cute.
Oh, Olaf was the cute little snowman. He cracked me up when he kept dreaming of what summer would be like.
In this one, he's gathering up the best holiday traditions for Anna, Elsa, and Kristoff.
So all those original characters will be in it? That sounds like fun!
There's going to be four new original songs in it too.
When does it come out?
November 22, 2017. Right in time for the Christmas holidays.
It's a Frozen Christmas present!
