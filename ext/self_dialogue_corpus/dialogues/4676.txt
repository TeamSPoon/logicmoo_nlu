Did you see the Cincinnati Reds baseball game last night?
Yes, it was another poor performance by their starting pitcher.
I know.  Its sad that they have everything they need to win except the starters.
It has really hurt them that Bailey and Desclafani have been injured all year.
That is so true!  The Cubs aren't nearly as good this year so the Reds could have contended with even a marginal starting staff.
I know.  Its going to be another long year.
At least we have Votto and Cozart to watch.
Votto is always great but where did Cozart learn to hit all of the sudden?
The announcers were saying Cozart had a new stance that allowed him to be much more relaxed at the plate.
Whatever he is doing is working.  He should be the All Star shortstop this year.
He should be but with all those Cub and Cardinals fans voting for their players he probably won't be.
They start a series with Colorado tonight so that probably means a lot more runs scored.  Those guys can really hit.
At least it is at home.  The Reds play much better there.
Yes, we can be thankful the game won't be in the thin air of Colorado where the Rockies really hit.
How about we see if we can catch a game on Sunday?
That sounds great to me.  I haven't had a chance to see them live this year.
Great! I'll check to see what tickets are still available.
I wonder who the starting pitcher for the Reds is Sunday?
I am not sure it matters; they are all bad.
That is sad but true.
