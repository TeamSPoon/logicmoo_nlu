Do you listen to music much?
Yeah, I listen to some everyday.
What have you been listening to lately?
Just whatever is on when I turn on the radio while I'm driving.
Yeah,that's been me lately too.
I mostly listen to pop recently.
I like some Brittney Spears now and then.
Oops I did it again.
Yeah, love that song!
And how about Ooh La La.
Oh right, that's from the Smurfs 2 movie.
Loved that song, really fun.
Probably my next favorite one is Crazy.
An oldie but still a goodie.
She seems to be doing really good now, she seems better.
Yeah she does. It shows in her music.
She made Slumber Party not that long ago.
Yeah, I think in 2016.
She seems more grown up in that one.
Yeah, older and wiser.
