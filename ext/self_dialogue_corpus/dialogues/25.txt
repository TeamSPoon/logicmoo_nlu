I just saw Sucker Punch the other day.
The action movie? Did you like it?
I liked the actions scenes more than the story.
Who was in that one? Jenna Malone?
Yeah, Jenna Malone and Vanessa Hudgens were in it.
Did you think they did a good job?
I thought they were excellent, and the soundtrack was great!
Any good fighting scenes?
They were all really imaginative with crazy backdrops and themes.
Sounds like it was really good!
