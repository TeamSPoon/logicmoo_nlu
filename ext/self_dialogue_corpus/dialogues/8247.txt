What are you listening to?
My man, Bruno Mars.
I love his sound. The guy is talented.
Agree.  I'm going to see him this summer when he's in Vegas.
Sweet! Have you seen him in concert before?
Believe it or not, I was in the audience at Ellen when he performed Uptown Funk.
That's crazy. I would love to see him in person.
Did you see him on Carpool Karaoke?
Yes, so funny with Bruno and James Corden.
Bruno is short, but his talent is huge!
