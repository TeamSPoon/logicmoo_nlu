What's the best war film you've seen?
Recently or ever?  That's a big library.
Let's just say ever and keep it easy.
Man, that's tough.  I would say Saving Private Ryan.
Wow, you read my mind.  That would be my choice as well.
There's any number of films you could throw in there recently.  Even Hacksaw Ridge recently was spectacular.
I remember watching Saving Private Ryan when it came out in the theater.
Me too.  I'll always remember the sound effects.
Yeah, especially the beginning on the beach.  Talk about thrilling.
Probably one of the greatest sequences ever filmed in my opinion.
Yep.  25 straight minutes of bullets, agony, just war itself.
It put you right in the middle of it all too.  It was truly unflinching.
The whole movie was good though.  I love Tom Hanks.
He played the character pretty straight up.  No frills, just a guy who wants to get home.
I pretty much knew he wasn't the guy who survived though.
I figured that it was also Ryan at the beginning and end just because of age.
That movie was totally robbed of Best Picture.
It didn't win?  What did.
Shakespeare in Love.  Can you believe that?
Seriously?  That's ridiculous!  What were they thinking?
