Man, the Falcons are stacked next year.
They will be good no doubt.
I can't believe they blew the Super Bowl.
Shocked everyone.  Biggest choke of all time.
I couldn't believe it when I saw it.
You have to think they will use that as motivation next year.
Maybe.  Depends if they can bounce back.
They will.  They are simply too talented.
Their offense is crazy good.
Yep, Ryan, Freeman...
And don't forget the best player, Julio Jones.
I didn't forget him.  He's a beast.
He might be the best receiver in the league.
It's subjective, but size and speed ratio, I'd agree.
I could see him getting 20 TD's this year.
It's not far-fetched, just depends on how much they want to feed him.
I would be chucking the ball to him every play basically.
Not every play, but I get what you mean.
No, I'm serious, every play.  They can't stop him all game.
They'll just double-team the dude if they were going to do that.
