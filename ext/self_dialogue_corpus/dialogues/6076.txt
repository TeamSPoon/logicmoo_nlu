I told my mom last night I thought what she said was disgusting, and she just laughed at me.
What? Why was what she said disgusting?
She was talking about how her neighbor brought her deer meat, and how much she loved it. I told her that was disgusting.
So she laughed at you?
She laughed cause I said how could you eat Bambi?
Oh, that Disney movie Bambi really was touching.
I cried so hard when Bambi's mother got shot in that movie. I was only seven, and I have never forgot that moment.
I know, that seems like too sensitive for something in a kid's movie.
I loved Bambi, and his little friend the skunk Flower, and his little friend the rabbit Thumper. I don't know how anyone could eat Bambi.
I know what you mean, I've never eaten deer either. They're too cute to eat.
