Did you ever see the Lion King?
You mean the Disney movie?
Yes , the one with Simba.
Yes I have, it was really good
His dad was Mafusa and there was the really bad lion who was his uncle named Scar.
He was pretty mean
There was a lot of action in that movie.
Yea Scar was always trying to kill Simba so he could rule.
Yea, what a creepy lion.
Elton John sang the theme song to that.
Yea I remember.
It as can you feel the love tonight
That was a good song.
And a good movie.
Disney puts out a lot of great movies.
