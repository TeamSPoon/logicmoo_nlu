Are you ready for the Steelers this year?
Oh you know it.  Every year we are contenders for the Super Bowl.
I think the head office had a really strong draft this year.
We got some very good prospects.
What do you think about T.J. Watt as our first round pick?
Well he's J.J. Watts brother so that's not a bad thing.
I couldn't agree more.
He had a really good combine so I think he is a really solid pick.
I can't wait to see the Steelers beat the Ravens this year.
It is a wonderful sight every season when that happens.
I think the Bengals will give a little trouble this year compared to many in the past.
Why do you think that? We have always had there number.
I think they are getting desperate and need to show something or a lot of them are going to be gone.
I still don't think that is going to make them much of contenders this year.
I don't know it could cause some close games.
We had a strong draft and we have mvp caliber players all over the field for us.
So you aren't worried at all?
Not in the least, ever year we are in the hunt.
In Pittsburgh we expect the win the Super Bowl every year.
If you aren't first, your last.
