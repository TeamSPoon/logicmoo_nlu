Would you like to come over this weekend? I'm having an 80s movie marathon.
That sounds like fun! What will we be watching?
I thought we'd start with Labyrinth.
Isn't that the one with David Bowie?
Yes, it's one of my favorites.
My favorite from the 80s was The Goonies.
We'll be watching that, too.
Neat! I also liked The Dark Crystal.
Oh, I forgot about that one! I'll add it to the list.
You should add some John Hughes movies, too.
Like The Breakfast Club?
Definitely! Also Pretty in Pink and Sixteen Candles.
Molly Ringwald starred in one of those, didn't she?
She was in both, actually.
Oh, that's right! She did a lot of movies back then.
Yeah, though The Breakfast Club will always be my favorite.
There were so many great movies that came out in the 80s. I wish we had time to watch them all.
Maybe we should make "80s movie marathon" a weekly thing?
That's a great idea!
Fantastic! I'll bring the popcorn!
