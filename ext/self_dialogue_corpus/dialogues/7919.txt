What's your favorite pop song?
I really like Backstreet's Back.
Really? Why that song?
I always thought Nick Carter's line about being sexual was hilarious.
Okay, I can see that.
What's your favorite pop song?
That's a tough one, but I think it's Can't Get You Out Of My Head.
By Kylie Minogue?
Yep, that's the one.
Oh, that's a great dance song!
