New Orleans Saints is my favorite team.
They began in 1966.
That's 50 years ago.
They are headquartered in the city of Metairie.
That is where their training camp is also.
They used to be in the Eastern Conference.
Then they were in the NFC West.
Now they are in the NFC South.
Their uniform is Gold and Black.
Sometimes it is White and Gold.
They have a fight song.
When the Saints go marching in.
Their mascot is Gumbo.
That's funny.
Tom Benson is the owner.
General manager is Mickey Loomis.
Sean Payton is a good head coach.
The Aints does not seem like a good nick name for them.
They have 10 playoff appearances.
They had temporary stadiums in 2005.
