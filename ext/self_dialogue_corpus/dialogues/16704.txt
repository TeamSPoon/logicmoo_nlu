How do you feel about music
I love music.
Do you listen to it often?
All the time
I love pop like rhianna, Ariana grande, Gwen stefani
They are good singers
Ariana grande is amazing, who do you like?
I like Linkin park, Jason Aldean, that dollhouse song is good
You're very diverse
I am, Melanie Martinez is the one that sings that dollhouse song
I like that song, it's so wierd.
It is, but it's very truthful.
I also love Megan Trainor
Me too all her songs are great.
I like the my future husband song.
That one is funny.
All her songs are great though
They are, I hope she comes out with more
Me too, she's the best
I agree
