Yeah, those were pretty catchy.
Did you ever see them at Disneyland?
Who, Anna and Elsa?
Yeah.
Nah, way too expensive to go there.  What about yourself?
We took our daughter there three years ago.  It was a four hour line!
No way I could ever stand in line that much!
My husband did the standing, I ended up playing in the park with her.
Man, you owe him something for that.
Yeah, it was super nice of him to do that for us.
