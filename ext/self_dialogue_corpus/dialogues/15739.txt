dont ou love a song that reminds and brings you back to a moment in your life
like what
well the group Night Ranger is one
what song
Sister Christian
what does it bring you back to
when I first met my husband way back in the 80's
why
not really the words
then what
everyplace we went that song was playing
wow it must have been popular
it was at the time even the 7-11 stores when we walked in was playing it
I love ac/dc music because I saw them in concert 3 times when I was a teen
did you ever see them when Bon Scott was the singer
yes I did
wow thats classic
it was a great experiance
I imagine, love hells bells its my favorite
thats good but back in black is the all time classic
