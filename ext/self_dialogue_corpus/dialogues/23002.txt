Hey I just finished watching a great movie!
What was it?
Dr. Doolittle!  Do you remember it?
From when, the nineties?
Yeah it came out in 1998.  It starred Eddie Murphy.
I remember the one!  I haven't seen that in a long time.
Yeah I hadn't either.  It is a great movie!
Doesn't he save a lion at the end or something?
Yes he does, but there's a lot leading up to that.  He goes through things with his job and his family.
It's based after an old movie, isn't it?
Yes, I think the original came out in 1967 so it was a long time ago.
I wonder what it's all about.
I doubt it was as funny as the Eddie Murphy remake.  That one was hilarious!
Yeah, everything with Eddie Murphy is funny though.
Pretty much.  Who else was in it?
I know Kristen Wilson and Oliver Platt were in it.  I didn't recognize anyone else.
I'm not sure who they are.
Yeah, and of course all the animals.  Most of them could talk remember.
Yes of course I remember that.  I just watched it.
I'm going to re-watch it myself!
