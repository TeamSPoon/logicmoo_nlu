Do you like comedy movies at all?
Oh I love them. My husband and I watch them a lot together.
I like to watch any new  ones that come out.
Me too.
What is a new one you've seen lately?
Let me think, I'm not sure actually what about you?
My husband and I watched the movie "Fist Fight" not long ago, it was hilarious.
I actually saw that in the movie theater!
Wasn't it hilarious?
Yes it was. I like Ice Cube.
He always plays a ruthless but funny character.
He does. I wouldn't want to mess with him.
What was the other main actor's name, do you know?
He's really familiar, you mean the guy from Horrible Bosses?
Yes that guy!
I think his name is Charlie Day.
Oh okay. I knew his face but not his name.
You know who else was funny in that movie?
Who is that?
JIllian Bell. Her character was so just inappropriate and funny.
