Hey did you see the last Cavs game ?
Oh man ! Yes I did.
How embarrassing is that for the Boston Celtics to lose by that many point ?
I know, right ?
Yeah, they didn't even try to come back.
Yeah I agree. They threw the towel at the half time.
I switched the channel at half time.
I did too, the eastern conference finals shouldn't be THAT boring.
I think it's all LeBron James's fault. He is just too good for the other teams.
Yeah, there is no excitement cause he se the goat.
Did you see the Cavs bench having fun before the halftime on every shot.
Haha yes, but did you see J.R. Smith's last shot ?
Oh, that was a beauty. And they got the record for biggest half-time lead with that shot.
So, who you got in the finals ?
Thats a though one. Both Cavs and Golden State Warriors are too good.
When someone has to win ?
Yeah I think it would be LeBron. He is just too good, man.
You think that GSW will choke again ?
Counting on it haha.
We will see what Kevin Durant has to say about that haha.
