Who is your favorite Disney princess?
Oh, easy!  My favorite princess for sure is Pocahontas.
Really?  Why Pocahontas?
Obviously because she's one of the first that did not act like a complete "damsel in distress".
She still ends up with the leading male at the end of the movie, just like all the other Disney princesses.
Right, but she watches out for him and shows her father she's willing to sacrifice her life to save his when he gets captured.
True.  I think Elsa is my favorite though because she truly does not rely on anyone but herself.
Pocahontas doesn't really rely on anyone but herself either!
She's got Meeko and Flit who are her sidekicks.
Well, everyone is entitled to their own opinion.
