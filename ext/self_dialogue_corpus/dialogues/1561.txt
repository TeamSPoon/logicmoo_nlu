What do you think of all the NFL teams changing cities recently?
I think it's bad for the league.
Why do you think it's bad?
It's hard to get a loyal fan base when there's a chance a team might move.
Isn't that why the St. Louis Rams moved to Los Angeles because of the fan base?
No, they moved to get a new stadium.
That's kind of a crappy reason to move a team.
It is.  Especially when St. Louis is still paying for the old stadium.
I don't understand why cities pay for stadiums.
It's to attract a team but then the team get greedy.
How do they get greedy?
These NFL teams want a new stadium every 10 or so years.
I remember when stadiums were around forever.
Those were the best stadiums they had history.
What is the oldest stadium in the NFL?
It's Lambeau Field in Green Bay.
That's a great stadium.
It's great because it has history.
Do you think the Packers will ever leave Green Bay?
No, actually the Green Bay Packers are owned by the town and the fans.
