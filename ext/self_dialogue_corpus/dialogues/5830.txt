I was complaining last week to my husband that we never do anything romantic together anymore.
I know a lot of married couples feel they get stuck in a rut of working and just being at home.
He suggested we go out to a movie for a date night.
Well, that sounds romantic! What did you go see?
The new Disney movie- Pirates of the Carribean- Dead Men Tell No Tales!
Well. that doesn't sound really romantic after all.
Of course, Johny Depp is still pretty cute, and I like his Jack Sparrow character that reminds me of Keith Richards, but no, it's not really romantic.
Unless if you act really scared during the scary parts, so you can snuggle up to your husband or hold his hand.
My husband's hands were full of popcorn and soda the whole time, so there was no hand holding.
Well, at least there was Johnny Depp to look at.
