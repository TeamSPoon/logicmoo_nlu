Does Madonna still record music?
I don't think I've heard anything by her lately.
Me either.  I wonder what she's been up to.
I haven't even seen her in movies.
Yeah, she's been quiet lately.
Her kids must be almost grown up by now.
It's hard to believe she started so long ago.
When was it that she first started?  The nineties?
Oh, no.  Her first big hit was in the mid-80s.
Wow, what was her first hit?
I think it was "Lucky Star."
I don't really know that one.
Well, I don't think it was the most popular one, but it was still a big hit.
What other hits did she have in the 80s?
I think there was "Papa Don't Preach" and "Like a Virgin" in that time.
Oh, I've heard those.
Yeah, she had a lot of big hits.
I'm more familiar with her later stuff.
Her earlier stuff was much better if you ask me.
I'll have to listen to some of it.
