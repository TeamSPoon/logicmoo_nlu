You know what else is weird?
No i don't know. And I don't want to know.
You know how in the end of Rogue One, they make a copy of the schematics?
Yes. What about it?
The screen was intentionally made to look like the screen from the 70s.
So what's wrong with that? it's good for the continuity of the films
Well, that's the whole point. Why is it necessary to have that continuity?
Because watching the original will be ruined if they had more advanced screens and technologies in Roguie One
ok Fine, even then why would they still use a little diskette to store the info? It's so anachronistic.
Again, continuity too the original films. These are important details that influence our enjoyment of the originals.
