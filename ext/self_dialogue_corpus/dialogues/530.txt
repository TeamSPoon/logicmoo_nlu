What do you think about all the rookies going into the league this year.
I think they will do the teams good.
I agree. Each team needed some.
Especially the colts alot have retired.
Who has retired?
Pat Mcaffe has retired.
Wow he did?
Yep! Just last year.
Wow. I thought he would go farther.
Me too!
Robert Mathis also retired.
I heard that.
The rookies will help all the teams.
I agree and they are new and young.
They are healthier too.
The Cowboys rookie last year did good for Tony Romo.
Yes they were great last year.
They could win it all.
I bet they coud.
I cannot wait to watch them!
