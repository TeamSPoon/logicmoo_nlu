Do,you think the chiefs make the playoffs?
I don't know.
They have a tough schedule.
I'm reading 8-8 predictions.
I saw that.
Andy Reid will keep them in it.
He's a good coach.
He's done well.
He had some good years with the eagles too.
Yes he did.
They have the fourth toughest schedule.
I saw that.
Could be a tough division too.
I think,the defense keeps them in most games l
I agree with that.
I don't know if they'll score a lot.
They have to get off to a better start than last year.
That's true.
A better offense than last year hopefully.
We will see.
