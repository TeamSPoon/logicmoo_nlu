Are you a big fan of Justin Bieber?
Not really.  Why?
I don't really care for him either.  I heard he messed up on some of his own lyrics.
Oh, yeah.  I heard that too.
What was the name of the song?
I think it was like Despacito or something like that.  Why?
I wanted to see if there's a video online.
Yeah, I've seen it before.
Does he look good in it?
Honestly, he looks drunk.
