My kids really loved the Pee Wee Herman movies.
They were hysterical!
Remember Pee Wees Big Adventure?
I do, the one with the Red Bike.
Yea, he had some really great scenes in that.
Yea like the bar room scene when he was dancing on the bar with all the bikers watching.
Yea but the best was LARGE MARGE.
Yea, my kids freaked when they saw that for the first time.
My kids watched that over and over and over again and STILL DO.
I do it, it is classic!!
Then there was Big Top Pee Wee.
Yea the one with Kris Kristoferson and that pretty circus lady.
Yea I think Gina Davis played her.
Now he has a new one out.
REALLY???? I did not know that!
Yes it is called Pee Wees Big Holiday.
Oh I have to watch it.
Me too.
I cant wait to see it.
Me too! Maybe we can watch it  together
