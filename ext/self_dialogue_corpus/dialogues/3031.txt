How exciting will the Panthers be this year?
It depends. How good is DA?
DA? Who is DA?
Panthers backup quarterback Derrick Anderson.
What does he matter?
What does he matter? He's Cam's backup, his support system. Without him the whole thing goes down.
Does he really matter that much?
He threw that interception against the Seahawks.
Yes, I remember that now. That game wasn't close though.
It was like 44 to 8, yes, though that was the first play of the game.
How is Tolbert doing?
He's doing well. It's nice to see him playing again.
He is kind of large, right?
Yes, that's accurate. He weighs 243 pounds.
I don't know if that's large. Cam Newton weighs 245.
They're that close? I wouldn't have guessed.
I know right?
Exactly. He just is taller.
Yes, I would say so. He's faster too.
That would be an interesting race.
