Have you seen Moana?
Yes, I have. What did you think about it?
It was amazing! I have seen it three times already!
Wow. What was your favorite part?
I like the "Shiny" scene with the Crab.
Oh that part was neat. I feel like it was so true to life.
I'm going to watch it right now!
Did you dislike anything from it?
Hmm, let me think. No.
Wow, I know a lot of people are big warriors for that movie.
