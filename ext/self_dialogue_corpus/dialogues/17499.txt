What kind of music do you like?
I like jazz and R & B. You?
I like rock mostly, though my tastes are a bit eclectic.
Who are your favorite bands?
I don't really have favorite bands, more like songs that I like.
How does that work?
I may like a song and have no urge to seek out anything else by the band or artist. It's just how I am.
I can't imagine that. If I find an artist I like, I try to get everything they perform.
Do you use iTunes?
Now I do. Back in the day, I would pirate music on Napster and such.
I did that too back in college, when it first became popular.
There aren't a lot of those kinds of sites anymore. It's mostly torrents now.
Sometimes if I can't find something, I'll look it up on YouTube and make a recording with Audacity.
That's pretty smart.
It also lets me do things like make megamixes of certain songs. Audio editing has become a minor hobby.
That sounds cool.
You'd be surprised at how simple it can be.
I'm technologically challenged. I couldn't do something like that.
Sure you could, with practice.
I don't know about that.
