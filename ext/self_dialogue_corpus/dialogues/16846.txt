what do you think of paramore
they are great
i know, right?
hayley is such an energetic vocalist
i want to see her live so bad
after laughter raised it up a notch
i liked riot better to be honest
probably just because its nostalgic for you
yeah, pretty much
i never liked misery business
me either. i liked miracle and crush
i loved crush
i used to dance to it all the time
we were angsty emo kids
paramore wasnt even that angsty
yeah, they werent my chem or the used
or seether
seether were super angsty
all they said about was pain
crying about exes
