Really, it's  well known. Good women have high voices, and powerful men sing bass.
That's just silly. A person's vocal range has to do with his or her vocal chords I'm sure, not personality.
In opera, the high voices belong to the pure. Consider Desdemona, Juliette, Angelica, and poor, fragile Ophelia.
It's just a convention. And what about Carmen?
Well, she's a mezzo, most comfortable in a slightly lower range. Such voices are usually  guardians, wives, confidants, little people.
Yeah? But the Marschallin is a soprano. She's middle-aged, and no maiden.
Yet she behaves as a woman should. Abundantly available, then generously getting out of the way of true love.
Okay, Tschaikovsky's Queen of Spades.
Again, she's a mezzo-soprano. Not immoral exactly, but not perfectly pure, and not young.
Aha, Lulu. You can't say Lulu is pure. She's a soprano.
Yet she is pure woman. There's a raft of tenors and baritones in Lulu, but Jack the Ripper is a baritone, while the banker is a bass.
I guess you're going to tell me why.
Just listen. Pinkerton, a tenor, is not man enough to save Butterfly, Jose, tenor, can't hold Carmen, Otello can't control himself.
I'm a tenor, as you know. So I guess the baritones are the real men?
Yep. The hero Wozzeck, Macbeth, Jack the Ripper in Lulu, Don Giovanni, these are the real men, apparently.
So what about the basses?
They're the real power.
Masculine power?
Pure power, like a soprano is pure innocence. Wotan, the father of the gods, Bluebeard, the Grand Inquisitor. Power, I said.
You worry me.
