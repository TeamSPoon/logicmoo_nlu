What is your favorite music genre?
Country is my all time favorite, but I do listen to some rock.
Country is also my favorite.
Who is your all time favorite country artist?
I would have to say Reba McEntire. To me she is a legend.
Yes I agree. I love her song Is There Life Out There.
That is a great song by her. I also like How Was I To Know.
She has many many great songs.
Did you know that when she was in high school, her and her two siblings formed a group called the Singing McEntires?
Really? Did they perform at shows?
They did perform at rodeos, but later disbanded and Reba continued solo.
I am glad she did because I love her music.
I agree. I also like George Straight.
Oh my yes, he is another wonderful legend.
His song I Cross My Heart, was the song I used for my wedding song.
That was a good choice. I also like his newer one, Give It All We Got Tonight.
Yes, that is another great one from him.
I am in the mood to listen to some music now.
I am too, let's put in a CD, who would you like to hear?
Put in George Straight in honor of your wedding song.
