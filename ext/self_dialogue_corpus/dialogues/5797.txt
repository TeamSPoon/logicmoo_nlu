Did you get to watch the live action version of Beauty and the Beast?
Yeah, I did! Emma Watson was awesome!
Yeah, she was great as Belle. The new songs were not bad at all, either.
They fit the expanded storyline, but I still kind of like the old stuff better.
I know what you mean. It was cool to see a bit more backstory.
You know, I think I remember the Beast's past being expanded on in the Christmas special but not much of Belle's past before she came to whatever town they were in.
She mentions having moved there, in the original. Also, Gaston had a bit of a job change. He was a hunter in the original and he's some kind of soldier in this one.
And LeFou, too! They changed him a bit, he's kind of...quesioning, I guess?
I guess. They still did really well with it overall.
True, true.
