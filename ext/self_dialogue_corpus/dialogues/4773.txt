Those Orioles pulled off another one
Yeah I saw that, in extra innings on top of that
Yeah it was a great ball game last night!
That Castillo home run was a thing of beauty
The great thing about that was he had just come off of the disable list
Talk about being ready to play!
Not only did he hit the game winning home run, he had hit another one earlier
That's a game you tell your kids about one day! Great performance!
Yeah they needed all of his offense last night
For sure and they best thing is that they are only 1/2 game behind the Yankees.
Did the Yankees play last night?
No, I believe they had the day off
Okay. Well that Castillo has been on fire since coming off of the DL.
Yeah I read on ESPN that he has been hitting .600 since coming off of the DL
Those are crazy numbers!
Hopefully he can keep that type of production up throughout the year
Yeah. They really needed this type of performance last night. The team has been struggling.
Yeah they were coming off of a 1-6 road trip.
They are fortunate to be only behind the Yankees by that 1/2 game.
Yeah they are. Now they need to pad some wins.
