Did you watch Cars or Cars 2?
Of course, who hasn't!
Heard Cars 3 is set to release around mid-July 2017!
Wow! I'm super excited about it, can't wait for it to release.
Same here, my family is looking forward to it.
I'm looking forward to Lightning McQueen's actions on the screen.
McQueen with Doc and Sally are fun to watch.
I wonder what kind of story is lined up in Cars 3.
Well, you don't have to wait long and it sure will be fun and entertaining.
Yes. Jotting down the date in my calendar for advance booking.
