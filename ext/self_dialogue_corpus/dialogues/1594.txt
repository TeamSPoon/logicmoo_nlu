You a big Bengals fan?
I was, but then they broke my heart.
How so?
Super Bowl XXIII
Oh, did they lose that one?
Yes, by four points and at the very end.
Man that's too bad.
Yeah, it was a killer to watch.
Who was their QB back then?
Boomer Esiason
Oh yeah, I thought he was pretty good back in the day.
Yep, they also had Icky Woods
Oh that's right. The Icky Shuffle.
That's right.
Wasn't he a rookie back then.
Yes, that was his rookie season.
Didn't do much after that.
Not really. Kind of fell away.
Until he appeared on a Geico commercial.
Oh yeah, that was funny.
