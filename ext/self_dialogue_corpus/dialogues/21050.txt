Hey, we just saw a fun little movie the other night!
What was it?
It was that movie called "Whiskey, Tango, Foxtrot".
Who's in it?
Tina Fey is the main character, and I think she also wrote the story.
Oh I know that movie! Wasn't it adapted from a book?
Maybe...
Yes, I'm pretty sure it was. Is it about a war correspondent in Afghanistan?
Yes!
Oh I saw it. It was pretty neat.
I really liked it actually, and I'm a big fan of Martin Freeman as well so I was happy.
He's so funny!
I love him in Sherlock!
And in the Hobbit - he was pretty hilarious in the Hobbit!
Yes, he adds a bit of sarcasm to the whole thing, which is welcome because those movies are heavy.
Yes, they are! A lot of movies for a little book...
Still, I enjoyed them. I guess I just go with the flow.
I know, they're really well made.
And the landscapes are amazing.
I heard most of those movies were shot in New Zealand.
