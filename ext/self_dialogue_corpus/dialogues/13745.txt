What song do you like the most of Lady Gaga?
Just Dance or Poker Face.
So you like her early stuff.
I also like her first songs.
Some of her outfits are something like that meat outfit.
That was hilarious. I don't think I could walk around in a meat outfit.
I also like Bad Romance do you like that one?
Yes I like that one too.
Paparazzi was ok also.
I didn't like that one.
