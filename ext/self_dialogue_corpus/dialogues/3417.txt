What older horror movie do you still love?
For me I have to go with 1992 Candyman.
That is a goodie.
I feel like even watching now scares me.
Virginia Madsen performance in this film is super believable.
I think also the area they shoot the film adds to the freight. That bathroom scene is so scary.
Ya just the crime of the area alone is frightening.
Cabrini-Green housing projects is the area it was shot in .. well partly.
That must have been truly horrifying. Make sense it felt so authentic.
Apparently they had to make a deal with the gang to make sure they were safe.I think they had many  gang members as extras.
