Did you ever get to go see Kong: Skull Island?
No, I have not. What was it like?
It was quite stunning, the director Jordan Vogt-Roberts did a great job with the action in this movie.
Who starred in the production?
Tom Hiddelston, Brie Larson, Samuel L Jackson and John Goodman were all in this one!
Nice cast, I suspect Tim was the leading man?
Yes, they end up finding an unchartered island together with quite a bit of danger and of course Kong.
It looks better than the last Kong movie they did in Hollywood.
You should go see it, maybe next week if I can I will go with you.
Thanks! That sounds great!
