What is the saddest part of Star Wars?
I thought it was really sad when Padme died
Yeah, she had a huge funeral though and that made me happy
She looked at peace and was pretty
Yeah it was a sad scene.
I really liked her character in the first few Episodes
Natalie Portman did so great. I could tell she loved Anakin
She never knew she gave birth to really important Jedi
That is pretty sad. She is in Heaven and is proud of Luke and Leah
She wasn't a bad fighter herself, she did what she needed and helped the Light Side
