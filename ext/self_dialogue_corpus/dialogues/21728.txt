What do you think is the most under rated movies?
I think there is more than one.
Well, what do you think are some of the most under rated?
I would have to start with "Inside Man".
What is that about?
It stars Denzel Washington, it is sort of a suspense.
Why is it suspenseful?
There is a bank heist involved.
What other ones?
Well, it is a but more well known, but there is one called Lucky Number Slevin.
Is that the one with a young Brad Pitt?
Yep, ever saw it.
I did, a long time ago.
It is funny, but also a thriller.
I remember that show having really funny one liners.
"The third time some one calls you a horse, perhaps it is time to go buy a saddle", is my favorite.
Right, after he says you punch them the first two times.
Yep, I love the ending too.
I actually have one too, with called The Secret Life of Walter Mitty.
That show was funny and moving.
