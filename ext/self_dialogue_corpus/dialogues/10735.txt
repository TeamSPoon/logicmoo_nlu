Have you seen all of the Fast and Furious movies?
Yes, I have seen all of them. Sad to see Paul Walker Die
Yeah, it sure was a tragedy
Do you have a favorite movie?  Mine was the last one "Fate of the Furious?
Not really, I am not a huge fan of the movies.  I watch them, but only once they come to DVD
What don't you like about them?
Well, I love the Rock so I'm glad they added him, but the stories are lame as hell.
Really, I think they are cool.  I love the action in the movies and the car scenes are great.
I guess if your a car guy you could.  I'm not and the chase scenes are ridiculously fake
Aww, come on man.  They are just fun to watch.
