Hey what is your favorite song from the 80's?
Wow, that is a big question...80's rock, beginning of rap, punk, electronica?
Well, I was thinking classic 80's rock like Foreigner, Toto or Kansas.
My favorite was the Fixx. I love that song I Reached The Beach.
Yeah, that's a great song, cool band. I liked Toto's Africa.
Yep, what about Cold As Ice, by Foreigner.
I saw them in concert. I think. It was long time ago.
Do you like the Styx? Remember Renegade?
Yeah, the beginning of that song gives me chills. Love it.
I know. I have a good friend that loves Journey. Can't say 80's classic rock with out them.
What ever happen to them? Steve Perry right?
I don't know. Do you think he is still alive or still playing?
Good question. I think the rest of the band is still touring without him.
Yeah, he kind of vanished after 2 albums.
What was their big song?
I think it was Faithfully or maybe Don't Stop Believing.
Yeah, that's it. I think that's what it was. Oooh how about Asia?
Yeah, that's my dog's name. I forgot about them. Wasn't Soul Survivor their big hit?
Yeah that was one of them. I think it came out in the early 80's.
Dude, that was a long time ago.
