I think I am gonna miss Tony Romo this year?
With all the injuries I can not believe you just said that.
No really though I think he was the glue that kept that team together.
You think that is the reason everyone seems to be getting into mischief more now that before?
I think he was the glue that kept the locker room stable.
He was good to Dak on the sidelines last year.  He is a stand up guy that is for sure.
Dak is just so young at 23.  Those older guys are not gonna want to listen to him.
That is for sure.  I think the older guys are gonna laugh at the "kid" trying to play grownup.
Jones is not gonna help stablize the team it is up to the Quarterback.
The quarterback is always the strong leader of the team.
I can not wait to see him at camp this year.
I think I am more interested in watching Zeke this year and the chemistry those two have.
Pre season starts his year with the cardinals.
Starting with a team out of the West is starting it off with a bang!
I think the Cardinals will be a easy starting game.
I don't think so.  I think they will have a strong team this year and the Cowboys better be ready.
I think they have a good chance in making playoff's this year.
If they can carry the East I think it will set them up for a good chance!
Is it Sunday night foot ball time again?
I am ready for some chips and salsa and sunday night lights!
