Its a little old school, but do you like Beatles music?
Sure do.  I went to see Beatle Mania once.
Oh how was that experience?
Sooo fun.  The music was fabulous and I got caught up in the show.
Sounds nice!  I like their earlier music myself.
Mmm-hmm.  It was good, but I like all of it.
Even towards the end when they were arguing?
John and Paul wrote some of their best music then.
Don't forget George.  LOVE "While my guitar gently weeps."
Ringo wrote a few catchy songs too!
