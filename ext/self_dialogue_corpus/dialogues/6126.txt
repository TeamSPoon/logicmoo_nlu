What are your thoughts on Beauty and the Beast?
Loved the original animated version.
Yes, that was an instant classic. Great story and singing.
I believe it was nominated for best picture
Really? I didn't know that
Yes, even before they started doing it specifically for animated movies.
I guess it didn't win.
No, I don't recall which one won that year. I believe it was 1992
Still, I enjoy watching it now. Still holds up.
Me too. I love Mrs. Potts.
