Have you ever seen the movie "The Parent Trap"?
Which one?  The old one?
Either, actually.
Oh! Yes.  I saw the original movie with Haley Mills during the 70's.
Did you ever see the updated version with Lindsay Lohan?
I did, but I didn't think it was as good as the original.
Most remakes aren't as good as the first.  Although, I did like the fact that the modern version had the mother living in England.
Where did the mother live in the original Parent Trap?
In Boston, I believe.
Where did the father live in both versions?
In the original the dad lived on a ranch in California.  In the modern version, the father operated a vineyard in Napa, California.
Who played the father in the modern version?
Dennis Quaid.
Did you catch the crossover actress?  The lady who played the step-mom-to-be in the original (Vicky), can be seen playing the mother of the step mom in the modern version.
That's really cool!  I missed that.
It was great casting.
Well, it was a nod to the parents of the current generation who had seen the old film.
It was.  I also liked that they updated the relationships of the butler and the maid.
I did, as well.  If they had stuck with the 70's era dynamics, It wouldn't have played as well in modern terms.
I agree. We should watch the two movies back to back one night soon!
