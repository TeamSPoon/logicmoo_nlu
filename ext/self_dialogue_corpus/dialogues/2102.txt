As of recent, all of the New York football teams sure have been bad
I agree, that's pretty clear
The Giants were the last good team and that was years ago they won the superbowl
Yeah and the jets are a joke
The Giants usually have good talent on the team each year I wonder what their problem is
They are poorly coached in my opinion
Yeah I think they recently fired someone from their coaching staff
I believe they fired their head coach
That was probably a good choice, it wasn't working out after they had won the super bowl
The jets are also pretty bad
Yeah but they've been bad for a while
They have a lot of problems
The jets are far away from being any good
Yeah they are lacking critical parts to their team
They need a complete overhaul so they can come back
The entire team and staff needs to be gutted
I'm sure new york fans are ashamed
I would be
I would be clinging to the Giants superbowl win a few years ago
I'm sure most of those fans are!
