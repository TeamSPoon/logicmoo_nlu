Hey, how you doing?
Good to see you! I'm fine. What's new with you lately?
I saw a really interesting movie last night.
What was it called?
Interstellar. It's the latest Christopher Nolan movie.
I heard that was good, but that it had some absurd science in it.
I really liked it. But yeah, there were some major implausibilities in it.
Like what?
Worst was the "going into a black hole and surviving" thing.
Ugh. I had that. But was it worth it?
I think so. I mean, there's are symbolic ways to interpret the absurd science in this case.
How do you mean?
Like, love was seen as a fundamental force in the universe, like gravity. Scientifically absurd, but beautiful on a symbolic level, and emotionally resonant.
I guess. I have a hard time with movies that have implausibility. Wasn't Matt Damon in that movie? He's one of my favorites.
Yeah, Damon played a minor character. A real jerk, did not behave very well to say the least!
How were the female characters in the movie?
There were some strong, smart women in the movie. Well, mostly the main character's daughter. But she was really good.
I wish there were more good female characters in movies.
Agreed. Pretty rare for a movie to have multiple richly-drawn female characters these days.
Especially science fiction movies!
