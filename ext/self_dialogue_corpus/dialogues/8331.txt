I just found this playlist of throwback hits from when we were in high school.
Wow, what's on it?
Do you remember Sugarcult?
Not really. What song did they do?
They had that hit "Memory."
Oh wow! I loved that song!
I know! I used to have it on my iPod.
What else is on it?
JoJo, Missy Elliott, and even Sisqo.
Send me the link. I need to hear this.
