I just watched the original trilogy again and I'm not sure how I feel about return of the Jedi.
Why?  That had a great story about the redemption of Vader, and Luke finally becoming a full Jedi.
Yeah, that was amazing, as were the effects as always.  But those Ewoks man.
I hear you, they were the low point of the movie.  But they were pretty awesome in that big battle.
I guess you're right.  Plus kids love them too.
Yeah, and how about when Luke and Leah revealed they really are siblings?
For sure, and Leah has force powers that Luke is someday going to teach her.
I'd like to see that, see how strong she is next to her twin brother.
They should be equals.
I agree, that would be a great movie.  Maybe for Episode 8.
