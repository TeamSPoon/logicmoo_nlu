Who is your favorite rapper from New York?
I would say Jay-z.
Why Jay-z.
I believe that he is the most lyrical and he has done the most for the culture.
What do you mean 'for the culture'?
Jay-z had broken down barriers and branched out of just hip hop. He is a mainstream mogul now.
I agree, he had done more than he probably ever thought he would.
Yes, and he has a new album coming out soon.
What is the name of the album.
The name is '4:44'.
