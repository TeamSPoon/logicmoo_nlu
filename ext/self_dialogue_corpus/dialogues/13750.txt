Lady gaga is at her best when she plays with just a piano.
You think so?
listen to dope and speechless.
they're good
its sparse but it allows lady gaga to showcase her vocals.
she really is an amazing singer.
she is so talented but some of her songs have too much going on.

you can really listen to her voice.
she is the best.
