When does the NFL season start?
Around September or October I think.
Nice. Who's playing in the opening game?
I'm not sure but they always make the defending champs play he opening game.
Man I hate the Patriots. I hope they don't win again this year.
Me too but their team got even better than last season.
Who did they get this offseason?
They got Brandin Cooks, a true #1 receiver and Gilmore, another lockdown corner.
Damn. They will be a though out but I have a feeling it's the Raider's year this year.
Didn't they get Marshall Lynch to come out of retirement?
Yes he filled one of their biggest needs and I think it will take them over the hump.
No way he's too old and he hasn't played in years.
That means he's more fresh and healthy. Plus they have one of the best offensive lines in football.
Well what about the Falcons? Do you think they can make it back to another super bowl?
No, I think the loss in last year's super bowl will be too though to get over mentally.
I agree. They choked big time.
And I hate them for it. I can't believe they handed the patriots another super bowl ring.
Why do you hate the Patriots so much?
I'm a Jets fans, we  are born to hate them.
Oh ok it all makes sense now.
