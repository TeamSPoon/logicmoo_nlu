So I've read all the Harry Potter books, and now I want to watch the films. Are they any good?
I really loved the first three, but then they kind of taper off.
I can't wait to see what they did with Hogwartz and everything.
Chris Columbus directed the first film, and it's really good.
I hope they didn't change too much.
They were actually really faithful to the original series. Who was your favorite character?
Well, Harry of course. I can't believe how mean his parents were to him.
Well yeah, but you know they weren't really his parents.
They acted like total ghouls to him!
I know. I think they were afraid of his powers.
