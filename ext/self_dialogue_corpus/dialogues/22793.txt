Do you remember when Martin Scorsese finally won a Best Picture
Wasn't it for Gangs of New York?
No, that was nominated, but didn't win.
So which one finally won?
The Departed
Oh yeah, I remember that one.
Yeah, I really liked it.
Quite the story line with all the double-crossing
Yeah, Matt Damon was the biggest rat of them all
But Mark Wahlberg finally gets him in the end.
Yes, that was a classic scene.
I really liked Leo's work in that one.
Yes, agree. He did a really good job.
And then Alec Baldwin had a nice supporting role in it.
Yeah, I thought he was pretty funny.
I really didn't like Jack Nicholson in it though.
I agree. The accent was horrible.
Yeah, and the way he finally died was a bit much.
Yeah, well you can't win them all.
No you certainly cannot.
