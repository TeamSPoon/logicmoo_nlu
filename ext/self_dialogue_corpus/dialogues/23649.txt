Guess what movie I watched yesterday.
Boy, could you give me a hint?
I watched it with my daughter. She used to be nuts for them when she was younger.
Was it a Disney movie?
Yes, but not a cartoon.
A teen Disney movie?
Yes. High School Musical.
I actually thought those were pretty good.
Me too. Unbelievable but good.
Yeah, I know, a whole school that sang good.
I guess when the kids watched all they saw was the good looking teens.
Yes, Troy and what was the other kids name in the movie?
I think his name was Chad.
Yes, that's it. The two heart throbs of the movie.
Basketball players and singers. What a mix.
Not in todays world.
How many of the movies did you see?
Only the first one.
I saw High School Musical one and two.
My kids were never really into them that much.
