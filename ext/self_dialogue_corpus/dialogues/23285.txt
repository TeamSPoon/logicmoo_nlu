Did you see Rogue One yet?
I sure it; it was great.
I agree.  I think it was the best Star Wars movie so far.
I'm not so sure I'ld go that far; I really like The Empire Strikes Back.
They're kind of similar, aren't they?  Both are pretty dark.
Yeah, but Empire Strikes Back did it first.
I think Rogue One did it better.  I liked that they were willing to have such a dark ending.
I did like the ending, although it did seem a bit harsh to kill everyone.
How could they have possibly escaped and had it be believable?
Good point; I'm not sure how you could have written that without seeming forced.
I thought the acting was really good, too.
The writing was excellent, as well.  I liked that the characters had shades of gray.
Yeah, having everything be too clearly good versus evil is a weakness in Star Wars.
It seems more compelling to have the good guys have some bad traits and bad people working with them.
Speaking of bad people, I do wish they had spent more time with Forrest Whittaker's character.
I agree; I felt short-changed there.
Maybe they'll get to him in another one-shot.
Hopefully so; better him that Jar-Jar Binks!
Anything is better than Jar-Jar!
That we can agree on!
