What are some of your favorite bands?
Oh I really like Accept.
I haven't heard of them before, what kind of music do they play?
They're definitely a metal band.
Are they any good?
Yes, very good. Their old stuff has some great hits.
What was their old stuff like?
It was metal from around the 80's, so it had that operatic type singing voice that was aggressive and distorted guitars.
Interesting. Are they still around?
Yes they are, they've been around for a long time.
Wow, I thought most 80's bands were gone by now.
Most of them are, but Accept recently revived with a new singer so they're back in production.
Do they have any of the original members?
I know they still have the same guitarist, who is incredible.
What's his playing like?
He plays a lot of very melodic type solos, and has a lot of catchy riffs.
That's good to hear, a lot of guitarists just play a ton of random notes it seems.
Some of them do, like the whole shredding theme of guitarists.
Like Van Halen?
He's more tasteful of a guitarist I would say, but he's written some great music that's for sure.
