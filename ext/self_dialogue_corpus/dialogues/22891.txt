What was your favorite movie as a kid?
When I was in the 5th grade, I really liked Galaxy Quest.
Oh right, I remember seeing that. It has Alan Rickman in it, correct?
Yes, that's right. Also Tim Allen and Sigourney Weaver.
That came out at the peak of Tim Allen's career, right?
Well maybe it came out as it was just starting to wane.
Rickman has such a great performance in that film.
He really does. It's also one of the only films that has a lathe joke.
I don't remember a joke about a lathe.
When they're down on the planet fighting the rock monster, one of the other crew suggests that he try to craft a weapon and make some sort of rudimentary lathe.
I kind of remember that. That's the guy who plays Monk who says that, right?
Yes, the actor's name is Tony Shalhoub.
Do you remember who directed the film?
I don't; can you look it up?
Yes, I just pulled it up. It was Dean Harisot.
What else has he directed?
He also directed the Fun with Dick and Jane movie with Jim Carrey in it, and Red 2.
I never saw the Red movies.
Oh they're okay.
Maybe I'll see if I can stream them.
