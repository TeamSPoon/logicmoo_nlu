Bat Out of Hell is by far the best album of time.
From Meatloaf, right?
Yes. Paradise By The Dashboard Light was my favorite song ever.
I love it still.
The duet, and their vocals together were jsut perfect.
Everyone always sang that song.
Everyone did. It's still great.
What year did that come out?
In 1977.
Makes me feel old.
That album is timeless.
It really is.
Two Out Of Three Ain't Bad was on that album too.
Yes, another timeless song.
He can still sing great.
He's got to be close to 70 too, don't you think?
Yes.
I'd like to see what he looks like now.
I haven't heard anything about him lately.
I know he was in a few movies.
