Did you ever see Source Code?
Sounds familiar.
It's the one where the guy has to figure out how to stop a bombing.
Oh yeah, like eight minutes at a time or something, right?
That's the one.
That was a really good film.
The ending was kind of weird though.
Yeah.  Guess they froze time and lived happily ever after.
Kind of weird, but entertaining up to that point.
Most definitely.
