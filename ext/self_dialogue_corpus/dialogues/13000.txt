The Empire Strikes Back is not as good as the original Star Wars
How can you say that? Empire is awesome
Star Wars had to create a universe people would be interested in. Empire just expanded it a bit and added a dumb twist
A dumb twist? it set up one of the best conflicts ever.
They had to retcon all the Luke and Leia stuff to make it make sense.But its still creepy
Since they didnt know they were related the stuff in Star Wars comes off as harmless flirting.
It still seems like they added that after the fact rather than having a master plan. Star Wars is a complete experience on its own
I agree that Star Wars built a great world but Empire gave it emotion.
All the emotion was present in the first film to use. They didn't have to add a silly soap opera plot to expand it
It wouldn't be the Skywalker Saga without a bit of soap opera melodrama to it.
