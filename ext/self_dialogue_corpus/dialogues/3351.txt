Have you seen The Autopsy of Jane Doe?
No I haven't but isn't Emile Hirsch in that?
Yes, Emile Hirsch and Brian Cox play a father and son who run a business operating a coroners office. The local sheriffs bring in an undamaged body from a heinous crime scene and want them to figure out her cause of death.
Wow, that sounds pretty intriguing! This is a horror movie right?
Oh yes it definitely is a horror movie. The suspense is excellent. There's a huge aura of mystery and the uneasiness I felt watching this was so terrifying it was good.
Does the whole film take place in this coroners office?
Pretty much, it takes place in the coroners office which gives it a creepy claustrophobic feel. The setup is very terrifying and the suspense as they're trying to figure out Jane's death is so unnerving.
Is this more supernatural horror?
There's definitely a supernatural horror element about this film. I won't spoil much but the first half of the movie during the autopsy on Jane is really startling with each discovery they find, and there's a lot of strange happenings that occur in the coroners office after the body arrives.
This sounds really good. I'll have to give it a watch! I think I remember Andre Orvedal directed it, he did a fantastic job with his other movie called Troll Hunter. I'll have to look for this!
