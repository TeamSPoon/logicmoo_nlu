Do you think the Suns are good?
They were with Nash
I agree. Once Gortat showed up, it all went bad.
Yeah and Scola and Beasley.
I miss the Nash days.
I miss the Barkley days.
I wish D'antoni would be their coach again.
I loved the run and gun offense.
The Suns always get the short end of the stick.
Yeah, we never get the top pick, or anything.
This year we got number 4.
Yeah and the Celtics and Lakers magically got the top 2.
I bet the draft is rigged.
Maybe, but I really hope the Suns get it together.
How do we do that?
Get rid of Bledsoe and Knight.
Yes and let Booker become the main guy.
I think we should fire Watson as coach too.
Who should be the coach?
Maybe Steve Nash is free?
