Do you like remakes of old classic movies?
I do like some.
Which ones do you like?
Well, have you seen the remake of Amityville Horror?
Is that the one with Ryan Reynolds?
Yes! He plays George Lutz.
I have seen that! He played the part SO well!
I agree, and I think it was way better than the original.
Have you seen the movie called IT?
The one with the killer clown?
Yes, it is based on a book by Stephen King.
Yes I have, that movie was so creepy.
Did you know they have been in the process of making it again?
No way, when does it come out?
I believe in September of 2017, you must watch some of the trailers.
Does it look scary like the first one?
I would say yes, the trailers show that the movie follows the original almost scene for scene.
I wonder if it will be as long as the original, I remember that was a very long movie.
I would hope so, in order to capture the original I would think it would be just as long.
We must go watch it when it comes out then!
