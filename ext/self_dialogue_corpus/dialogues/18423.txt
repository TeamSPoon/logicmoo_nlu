Whatever happened to Marilyn Manson?
Who cares?
I kinda dug his music.
You and every other goth on the planet.
Those types never really stand the test of time.
Too true.
Still, I always wanted to see him in concert.
I'll bet that's a creepy show.
I would have to imagine.
I just looked him up online.
And?
He's still touring.
Awesome.
You can make you life long dream a reality.
You're such a smart aleck!
Can't help it.
Tell you what, if he comes through town, I'll go with you.
You're the best!
Anything for you my freind.
Thanks!
