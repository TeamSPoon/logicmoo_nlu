What are your thoughts on the sequel to Mary Poppins?
No, just no.  I can't.
Why not! I love Emily Blunt!
Because I don't think you can recreated that magic. And Julie Andrews is so perfect!
Yes, she won an Oscar for it. But, I think the sequel will be great.
And it won't have Dick Van Dyke.
Hey, he's not dead.
But if he is in it, he'll be ancient. Why not make something new?
Well, there were multiple Mary Poppins books.
I don't care.  I don't want to watch it.
