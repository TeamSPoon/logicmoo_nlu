Hey do you think it's fair to say Michael Jordan is the greatest player of all time?
Well, he is generally regarded as the best of all time. But if he is the greatest, where are all of the rings?
He might not have the most rings but he helped bring Basketball to mainstream America with his crossovers.
I think Jordan is the most prolific basketball player that was able to do everything, from defense to offense.
True.  People can claim that people have done much more impressive things than him, like Wilt Chamberlain's 100, Bill Russell's 11 rings and Kareem's with the most points ever.
They even claim that LeBron is near or even on Jordan's level, and that he wouldn't have been that good without Pippen/Rodman,
Shoot. His Airness has created a threshold that players, professional or not, try to reach or recreate.
Michael even mentored Kobe and he's without a doubt one of the best players ever to play.
I don't know about all of that.Kobe is and was a ball hog in my opinion.
You just don't like Kobe.
What is there to like about a selfish player like him?
I wouldn't go that far.  And yes I think it is fair to say Jordan is the best NBA player to ever play the sport.
I think it's more than fair.
Yeah.  With his ability to do everything and his high flying dunks, I agree.
Nowadays, so many new and upcoming players are copying Jordan's dunks.
True. You can tell they watch tapes of the man and strive to be like if not better than Jordan.
You know some people say though, "If Jordan was the best player ever, why doesn't he have the scoring title or the most championships?"
This is logic that I've heard before, and it's quite frankly ridiculous.
Yeah, me too. I was watching a program last night and they were saying Jordan couldn't win until Bird and Magic declined.
I honestly never understood this reasoning. It's like saying "Kobe wouldn't have won if Prime Jordan was still playing"
