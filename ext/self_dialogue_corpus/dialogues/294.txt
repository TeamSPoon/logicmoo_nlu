Why is Iron Man such a jerk?
He's just confident, that's all.
No, he's a jerk.  Every movie he's been in, he's been a complete jerk to anyone that gets near him.
That's part of his allure.  He's an anti-hero of sorts.
It doesn't help that Robert Downey plays him and he strikes me as kind of a jerk in real life too.
You seem very opinionated on this.
Well, I'm just a bit sick that Iron Man has been in, what, five, six movies now and he's the same guy he was since the beginning?
Some characters don't have the same story arc.
I'm hoping they kill him off in the next Avengers movie.
I bet they will actually.  His story is pretty much over at this point.
