Seen any good movies this summer?
Yeah, I've seen a few so far.
What's been the best one you've seen this summer?
Nothing has really blown my mind, but I'd probably have to go with Guardians of the Galaxy volume 2.
Oh yeah, I saw that one. Pretty solid.
Yeah, 'pretty solid' is a good way to describe it.
It's one of those movies that you have a good time watching, but it doesn't really stick with you.
Agreed. I would definitely see part 3 though if they make one.
Oh, they'll make one. Those movies are making way too much money to not keep making them.
What have you seen this summer that you've liked?
I saw Wonder Woman the other night; it was pretty good.
Cool. Yeah, I want to see that one.
You have to wonder when people will burn out on the superhero thing.
Not yet, apparently.
I feel like we're just on the edge of oversaturation.
Yeah, they're definitely getting into some lesser known superheroes.
Who knows though, maybe the lesser known superheroes will inject some freshness into that genre.
I can see that, since most people aren't already familiar with the story.
Right. You can only reboot Spider Man so many times.
Haha! Yeah, maybe you're right.
