Hey do you play any sports?
Not recently. But I did play baseball in high school?
No way! Me too!
Sweet, did you go on in college.
I wasn't recruited at all, but I did play on a club team. It was more of an excuse to get together and drink.
Yeah, I played for a while in college, but stopped after freshman year. It was too much!
Yeah, I'd been playing since t-ball, so it was weird to stop, that's why I joined the club team.
I've thought about starting up an adult league around here.
That sounds sweet!
Would you be interested?
Yeah, totally. I think I have a couple buddies that would be too.
I was shortstop in college.
Yeah me too! My roommate was a pitcher. I haven't talked to him about uit, but he'd probably be down.
Sweet!
Have you thought about where we would play?
KInd of, I think maybe Oak Park. If we do it on a weekday I think there will be space.
That'd be sweet, not too far from my apartment.
Sweet! I'll ask my roommate and maybe put an ad on craigslist.
Yeah, keep me posted! My schedule's pretty open after work.
Nice. Play ball!
