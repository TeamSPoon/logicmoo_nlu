Hey did marshawn lynch retire again
No but he should i think
Why dont you like him
Because he isnt as good as everyone thinks
Dude have you seen his stats ?
Yeah and they dont impress me
I dont like him as a person also but he is a good player
Ok he might be decent but thatts about it
Alright dude lets talk about someone else
Alright what do you think of tom brady
Dude hes a cheater
No they lied about that
No way there is so much proof saying otherwise
He has evolved so much since then so it doesent matter
Yeah cheaters never change and he still isnt better than peyton
Sure peytons good but hes no tom brady
Peyton has a lot more history than brady first of all
Yeah but that means nothing
He has not become great from just history but his games also
You know nothing about football
