How good are the Seattle Seahawks?
They are one of the best teams for sure.
You think Russell Wilson is a great Quarterback?
He isn't a bad quarterback.
I would say 2015 was a much better year then 2016 for him.
He would probably agree with you.
He had 13 fewer touchdowns and 3 more interceptions in 2016.
That is a reason for him to do much better this year.
You are right he will want to prove the haters wrong.
All he has to do is use their hate as motivation.
Well I'll keep an eye on the Seahawks games next season.
Good call there should be some exciting games.
I wish they played East teams more often though.
Yeah they don't play certain teams very much.
It would be nice if the schedule included a game against every other team.
They should all play at least once before the playoffs.
I know it makes no sense that they don't.
Maybe we should write a letter to the NFL.
If you write it I will sign my name.
Sounds good but I will sign my name first!
