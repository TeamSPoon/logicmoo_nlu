I'm ready for football season!
Me too, think the Bengals can do anything this year?
I hope so, it's been awhile.
Yea, Icky Shuffle days.
I love the Icky Shuffle!
Icky Woods was more entertaining than talented.
But he was fun!
Probably more talented than the guys we have now.
Dalton isn't bad.
If it hadn't been for the 49ers, we might have two Super Bowls to celebrate.
Hey, some teams have never even been!
This is true.
I wish Boomer Esiason could come back and lead this team.
Yea, we ain't had much success at quarterback.
At least the Browns give us chances at two victories.
Yea, but I'm sick of Pittsburgh rubbing our noses in their success.
I hope we beat them this year.
I don't like the Ravens either.
I don't think anyone outside of Baltimore does.
They are the stolen Browns franchise.
