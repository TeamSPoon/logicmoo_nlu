I am going to a concert this weekend, a music concert.
Are you?  Who are you going to see?
I am going to see Bruno Mars.
Oh I am jealous! I wish I could go!
Yeah, his concert starts around 8pm Friday.
How much did it cost?
$50 a ticket for the seats.
Wow, sounds like they will be great seats.
I love his songs, Talking to the Moon and Marry me. I can't wait to hear him soon.
He is phenomenal. His song " Just the Way You Are" is my favorite.
Uptown Funk is the best too.
Yes, it is so fun to dance to!
Yes, I dance to it often ;) I love dance music.
How about Whitney Houston?
Oh yes, Whitney is the best.  I wanna Dance with Somebody is one of the great songs.
I wish she was around more, was sad to hear her passing.
Yes, her songs are always with us.
Do you think that they will do an album with her collective work in it soon?
Yes I am sure they will.  It will cost a pretty penny too.
I would buy it.
