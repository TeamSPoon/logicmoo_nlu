The Sound of Music was a good movie, wasn't it?
Yes I thought so.
I saw it in the theater with my parents. I guess I was about 13.
It starred Julie Andrews.
She had a wonderful voice .
It also starred Christopher Plummer.
Yes I remember him singing a bit in it as well.
My favorite Things became quite a hit.
Yes the whole soundtrack did.
It taught you a lot about the history at the time as well.
Yes it did.
The scenery was really beautfiul in the Austrian mountains.
Yes.
It was a really long movie though.
Yes it really was, seemed like a good 3 to 4 fours long.
I tried to get  my kids to watch it but they got bored.
Really? My neice loves it, she is 28.
I guess it appeals to some of this millenial generation.
It was a great movie.
Yes it was.
