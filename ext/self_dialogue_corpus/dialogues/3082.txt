Dez Bryant is an amazing receiver.
He is amazing.
I hope he stays away from injuries this season.
Yes, that's tough to do but I like his talent.
He keeps the fans on their toes.
Also, he keeps the players on their toes.
He has speed and determination.
I would love to see him play in person.
That would be incredible.
Do you think that their will be some great rookies this year?
Yes, indeed.
Who are you looking out for?
I hear that DeShaun Watson is going to really provide a solid game.
He's quite a player.
Also, Dalvin Cook will help the Vikings I bet.
Wow, sound like they have it made.
The rookies always add some spice to the game.
I don't know how the rookies do it
It must be tough, but they sure work hard.
They are good at showing what they've got.
