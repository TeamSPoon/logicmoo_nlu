Are you going to see the new Star Wars when it comes out?
I didn't see the first one.
What?!
I heard a mixed review.
It was awesome.
I'll take you word for it.
Did you like the originals?
Yeah.
So, what's the problem.
The prequels.
I kind of see your point, but this is an entirely different creature.
Yeah, just don't care for Lucas.
He has gone down hill a bit, but I don't think he had much to do with the new ones.
He owns it!
Nope. Sold to Disney.
Oh! I had no idea!
So, gonna watch it now.
I'll think on it.
You have to, so you can come with me to the new one.
Alright.
