If you could pick one movie to watch for the rest of your life what would it be?
Thats a hard question with so many possiblities.
Yeah thats what the point of us talking is!
True, I would say The Butterfly Effect
Whoa that is a shocker
I think it was great.
Ashton Kutcher did a good job in that film.
I think the plot twist was wonderful.
How good do you think Amy Smart was?
Great because she played like 3 different roles in the entirety of it.
I forget who else acted in it.
No one too notable, but it was a good film either way.
Do you like Ashton Kutcher as an actor?
He is not that bad to be honest
I like the diversity of roles hes had.
Well he always did good in specific roles.
Like in Dude Wheres My Car?
That was a good one for stoner flicks.
It did fit the genre like it should have.
Exactly it wasnt too heavy nor was it completely ludicrous.
