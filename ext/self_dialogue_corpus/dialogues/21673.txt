What is your favorite Al Pacino movie?
Probably Dog Day Afternoon.
Really? I'm surprised you didn't say Stand up Guys.
Is that a movie with him in it? I have never heard of it.
Yeah him and Christopher Walkin are the main characters.
What is it about?
They are two old hitman, Pacino just got released from prison.
Sounds really interesting. Go on.
Basically Christopher Walkin was his best friend but got ordered to kill him when he was released from prison.
That sounds kinda sad actually.
Yeah, but Christopher Walkin decides not to kill him in the end.
Thank god, it would be horrible for him to kill his friend like that.
So they both decide to go and kill the guy who ordered the murder.
Were they successful?
Yes, they actually both survived throughout the end of the movie.
That sounds like a really great movie.
It is, you should check it out.
Well, its probably not good for kids right?
No, definitely not, haha.
Well, I'll watch it when I my kids go to bed then.
