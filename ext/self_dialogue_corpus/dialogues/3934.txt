Did you see Heat?
You mean with Al Pacino and Robert Dinero?
Yes, that's the one.
I saw it. That was a good movie.
They say it's a drama but I think it's a thriller because of the bank robbery plots and the plot to catch the crew.
I would call it a thriller as well.
Did you know that Dinero and Pacino did not film the movie together?
What are you talking about?
They were never on the set at the same time. Every scene together one is facing another, never side by side or touching.
I think I do remember hearing something like that. It's still a good movie though.
