I'm excited to see Guardians of the Galaxy 2.
Me too. I like that Marvel supposedly kept this movie light and fun like the first.
Marvel has a bad habit of making movies darker as a serial progresses.
I know. The Captain America movies have gotten a little too serious.
Yes, and the last Ironman movie was no fun at all.
It isn't just Marvel that has a tendency to make movies more grim as the series progresses.
Yes, it was amazing how different the movie Kill Bill 1 was from Kill Bill 2.
Frankly, I think they've ruined the Batman franchise by making the movies so dark and brooding.
Yes, during the last few Batman movies, all I could think about is how Batman growls his words constantly.
I loved that the Lego Movie made fun of that.
The Superman movies have pretty much ruined that franchise also.
Yes, once you've had Superman save the world, then how can you up the stakes in the next movie. It gets ridiculous.
I really haven't liked any of the Superman movies, because Superman is always so perfect that he's boring. He's so powerful that the villain is never any real threat.
I have to admit that I liked the Batman movie that starred George Clooney, because it was just so silly.
I loved that it featured so many big stars like Arnold Schwarzenegger and Jesse Ventura.
Jesse Ventura is so entertaining. I loved him in Predator.
The two Predator verses the Alien movies were absolutely awful.
I hated that they weren't very good because it sounded like a good idea to have those two beings face off in a movie.
It would've been a lot better if Jesse Ventura was in it.
Yes, and Rocket Racoon and Groot, too.
