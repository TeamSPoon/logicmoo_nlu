How excited are you for the Patriots this season?
Oh man, I am so stoked.
I am too! What's your prediction for their record?
I think they could go anywhere from 10-6 to 16-0. How about you?
I think they're going 16-0!
I think they have a chance! Back to back Super Bowls?
That would be so awesome. They've added so many players.
I know. I'm most excited about Brandin Cooks. How about you?
Cooks is gonna be nasty in this offense. I'm excited about a healthy Gronk.
Yeah. Bennett was good in his absence last year but Gronk is the best.
I'm also stoked about our new running backs.
Yeah. I think Gillislee is going to be great. I don't know much about Burkhead though.
I think Burkhead will be just fine. They can't keep all those backs though, who do you think gets cut?
I think DJ Foster is gonna be the odd man out.
Yeah I do too. I'm also excited about the secondary. Two number one cornerbacks?
Gilmore and Butler are going to dominate.
Where's the Super Bowl this year?
I think it's in Minnesota.
I've always wanted to go to Minneapolis. If the Patriots get in, wanna go?
I'd love to. We'll see though. Hopefully they make it.
