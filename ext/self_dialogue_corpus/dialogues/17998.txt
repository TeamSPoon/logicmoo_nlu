What are you listening to Joaquim?
Oh, hey Mario, I'm listening to ELO.
ELO?
Yeah, they're a band from the 70s.
Hmmm.  What does ELO stand for?
Electric Light Orchestra
Interesting.  I think I've heard this song before, what's it called.
It's called Mr. Blue Sky.
It sounds very familiar.  Where have I heard that before?
A lot of people recognize it from Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2.
Ah, yes. Thats it!
Here, let me play you another song.
Sure, What's this one called?
Here's "Don't Bring Me Down."
Oh, I kinda recognize this one too.
I thought you would, this song is still pretty popular on the oldies stations.
Nice.  Who's the lead singer?
His name is Jeff Lynne.  He's a popular producer as well as a talented singer.
Oh, didn't he do something with The Beatles?
Yeah, he worked on the "new" songs from the Anthology series!
