When will the Dallas Cowboys get better?
I miss Troy Aikman.
Dave Compo was coach in 2002.
I liked when Tony Banks was quarterback.
Roy Williams was good in 2002.
Remember Walter Payton?
Then Bill Parcells was coach.
Who was quarter back in 2005?
I think it was Drew Bledsoe.
Remember Terrell Owens?
He got happy when he got a touch down.
In 2009 their practice field cover collapsed during a wind storm.
12 players were injured.
And some coaches also.
2010 Jason Garrett was interim head coach.
They have a blue star as the logo.
It represents THE LONE STAR STATE.
That would be Texas.
It is the best known logo.
Because they are the best.
