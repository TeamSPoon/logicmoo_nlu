Did you ever get a chance to see the Tron sequel?
No not yet, is it any good?
I thought it was pretty awesome. Did you see the original?
Ya a long time ago when I was a kid.
Yes Jeff Bridges is in this one to.
Oh really, he is a great actor.
Yes and the special effects are really good in this one.
I bet; a lot better than when the first one came out I imagine.
Yes - but it has the same look to it as the original.
Awesome! I will have to see it.
