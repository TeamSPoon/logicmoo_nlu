Have you ever heard of Kasabian?
Not sure.  Are they American?
No. They are British.
I think I did.  The guitar player has real long hair, sort of a young Keith Richards.
Serge.  He writes with the lead singer.
There was a song that was in a Colin Farrel film that I just loved.
Le Fe Verte.  It's about Absinth.
What was the movie?
London something.  He did the film score.
He is really talented.  Gorgeous, too!
I'll say!  The singer is not bad, either.
They, or he, have gotten too show bizzy.  Since he cut his hair, he started looking to slick.
I like to watch earlier videos.  Like 'Fire' or 'Processed beats'.
What was that album called something lunatic asylum?
'West Ryder Pauper Lunatic Asylum', I believe.
Right.  A friend listens to that a lot.
They are really different, aren't they?
He said that they sell out stadiums in Europe, but nobody knows who they are, in this country.  I know, weird.
Or as Donald Trump would say...SAD!
This really is sad, people don't know what they're missing.
