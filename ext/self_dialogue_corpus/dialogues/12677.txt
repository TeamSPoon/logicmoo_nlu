Do you like Star Wars?
No, I think it's terrible
What? Seriously?
Yeah, the characters are so boring and static
How many have you seen?
Just the first couple
You mean Episode I or Episode IV
Whichever one they have the race
Oh well that's the problem, the prequels are terrible. Watch the originals first
Alright I guess I'll give them another try
