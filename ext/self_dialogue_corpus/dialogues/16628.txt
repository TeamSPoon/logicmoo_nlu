Do you stream any music?
Like online?
I think thats the only way you can.
Yeah I use YouTube most of the time.
I prefer Spotify to listen to music.
I think thats a great app too but the commercials are long.
The paid version eliminates that.
I can get Sirius radio cheaper per month than Spotify.
Right but you cant take Sirius with you wherever you go
Do artists get paid alot from those music apps?
I think a band doesnt make a ton on their music anyway
So how are they turning a profit?
Merchandise sales in my opinion.
So its better if I buy a hoodie than an album
In a way yes and in a way no
Explain please.
When you buy the merch they get paid and when you buy the album the record label gets paid.
Meaning more albums more money from the record label?
Kind of, its a give and take.
It sounds super lopsided to be honest.
