What is the deal with John Wall just taking over all of a sudden?
What do you mean all of a sudden he has been a top point guard for years?
Well yeah but now he is really taking over.
I suppose but I think you just were not paying attention to him before.
That is possible but maybe there is reason if he cannot dominate the Celtics.
Well is it really his fault, he has been going crazy but no one is helping him out.
I don't think that is true. I just think the Wizards may not be there yet.
I guess but the Bulls gave the Celtics the same challenge as the Wizards.
I am not sure that is totally sure.
Well the series is likely to end up with the same series score.
Maybe, but the Bulls also had playoff Rondo who was playing out of his mind.
True but the the argument is if Wall is really a top point guard, and based on what you said he falls into the Rondo category.
Well what i actually said is he falls into the "playoff Rondo" category which is a totally different thing.
True.  I wish he hadn't gotten injured cause who knows what would have happened with the Bulls.
Yeah they were clearly the worse team but they were going insane until he went down.
Yeah it makes me wonder if they will bring him back next year.
I doubt it.  He wasn't even starting earlier in the year.
True but maybe his playoff performance will get him paid.
Possibly but he has a history of being inconsistent.
That makes a lot of sense.
