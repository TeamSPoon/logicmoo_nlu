Wasn't Whoopi Goldberg in a Disney movie?
Yeah, she was in The Lion King. She was one of the hyenas.
Oh yeah, the really goofy one, right?
Yeah. Her name was Ed I think.
That sounds right. Who voiced Timon and Pumba in that?
I don't remember but it was a duo that did a bunch of stuff together.
Was one of them Nathan Lane?
Yeah! It was Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick.
And Nathan Lane was the warthog right?
Yeah, that's right. Let's not forget Jonathan Taylor Thomas as young Simba.
