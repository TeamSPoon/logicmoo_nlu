Hey man, are you into those wizard movies?
Blizzard movie? You mean the World of Warcraft movie?
No, wizard movies. You know, Harry Potter.
Oh! Yeah, not really. I've only ever seen the second one and I couldn't quite figure out who was what.
You really should try them all out. The first one really sets the scene.
How so?
Well, in the first one, you see where Harry is starting out. Actually, you get to see where all the kids come from.
Even all those red headed ones? That part was confusing.
Yeah, the Weasleys. That really is a big family. You only get to know a few of them at a time.
That Ron kid was pretty goofy.
Do you not like goofy characters?
Actually, I like the goofy characters the most. They feel more down to earth and real.
Then you most have loved the half giant, Hagrid.
Well, yeah. I liked that guy. Wasn't he expelled from school and everything? But got to come back to work for them?
Yeah, he was. His full story is pretty interesting. His book character and movie character line up pretty well.
So, he's a half giant in both of them?
Yeah, he is. He also uses that fact to help the heroes, you know, Harry and the bunch, out of a lot of trouble.
So, the real hero of these movies is Hagrid?
Well... you know, you could say so. Hagrid is the one who gets Harry to Hogwarts in the first place and he helps them all through the story.
Isn't it great when heroes of movies are different than the main character? It gives it some good depth.
