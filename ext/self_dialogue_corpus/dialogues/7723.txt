What did you think of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix?
I liked it.  It was a turn for the more mature part of the story line.
Yeah I agree, it was really cool to see how strong Harry really is too.
I know what you mean.  And to see him as a leader.
He never really thought of himself as a leader, but clearly he is, and he was a good teacher.
I know.  Tough as nails too, he doesn't seem it behind those round glasses, but he's top shelf.
I just hated that lady in pink.  Looking like she was some innocent person but really she was evil.
I know what you mean.  I love how the students were so powerful by the end she couldn't control them.
Yes, it was a good point that force alone cannot take on the wizard world.
Foreshadowing no doubt for the final movie.
