Hey, what NFL team you rooting for this year?
Detroit Lions, I want to see them go to the Superbowl.
Their name came up in conversation because of some players that are being inducted into the Hall of Fame.
Oh yeah, who were they talking about?
The running back; Barry Sanders..
He's retired,  what did they have to say about him.
It was all good actually. Experts ranked him as the second greatest running back in NFL.
Wow, it's awesome to still be recognized for your talent after all these years.
Right. He retired back in 1999?
Yes in his early 30's.
He was smart, he got out while he was ahead.
You know it; football does take a toll on the player's body.
Yeah and we aren't feeling it, ha ha. We just feel the excitement while the endure the pain.
You got that riright. Who you looking at this year?
I'll be watching the Buc; they have potential.
They do, they also have some young players.
Yeah, they just drafted a 27 year old quarteback, named Sean Renfree.
Didn't he come from the Falcons?
I believe so.
Well I guess we will see how our teams do this season.  Good luck.
