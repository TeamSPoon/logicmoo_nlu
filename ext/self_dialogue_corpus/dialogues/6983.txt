When are they going to make a sleeping beauty remake?
They kind of already did.
What do you mean?  I haven't seen anything about it.
Maleficent.  Came out a few years ago, remember?
Well, that's not really a true sleeping beauty movie.
Of course it is.  Just a different perspective.
That movie was kind of dark and mysterious.  I want something lighter.
You can't make all movies all rainbows and unicorns though.
It frightened my daughter quite a bit.
She'll probably really like it when she's older.
