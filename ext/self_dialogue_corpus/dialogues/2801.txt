Did you catch the Cowboy's game on TV yesterday
Man I haven't watched a football game since the last time the cowboys won the Superbowl.
You mean you live in Texas and you don't follow the NFL?
Nope, all a bunch of nonsense to me, just another way mass media tries to steal my money.
Do you have a favorite team, or did you have when you did watch.
Yeah, I was a Houston Oilers fan.
You know they don't exist now right?
Yes, just because I don't follow the NFL doesn't mean I have my head in the sand, Houston has a team called the Texans, right?
You are correct sir, what turned you against the NFL?
Think about it man, half the players are criminal rapist drug addicts, you really want to spend your Sunday, Monday, and Thursday free time watching them.
It's not that bad man, the NFL works hard to keep their players in line.
Alright, the NFL, have they ever given you anything for free to reward you as a loyal customer, and TV games don't count, because you spend at least an hour of the game watching commercials.
Yeah, I do kind of see your point.
They are there to take your money, they nickel and dime you and the taxpayers who live in the communities that have to pay for their Billion dollar stadiums.
Man you're killing me with your anti-NFL negativity.
The last good NFL player was Earl Campbel, everybody else has paled in comparison.
Well let me ask you this, who was your favorite all time NFL player when you did watch.
Roger Staubach, nobody better than him.
What would make you come back to football and start watching the games again.
When the NFL and the Teams start paying the taxpayers back for subsidizing their Billion dollar stadiums, and we know that isn't going to happen.
