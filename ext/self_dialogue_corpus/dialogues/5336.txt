Did you watch Pirates of the Caribbean: Salazar's Revenge?
No, haven't yet checked it out.
How about the previous instalments of the series?
I watched part 1 and 2.
How do you like this series?
Well, to be honest it was kind of disgusting to watch those creatures on that ghost kind of ship.
Well, you get use to it with time.
Captain Sparrow is entertaining.
He sure is more than entertaining and his antics are at times too much.
He is the soul of the series.
