Are you interested in seeing the new Pirates of the Caribbean movie?
Probably, I've seen the others but I don't really remember them well.
I don't either but I plan on watching them all again before i see the new one.
When does it come out?
I think May 26th; I can't remember the name of it though.
It's called "Dead Men Tell No Tales"
I hope it's as good as the others, I wonder what the reviews are.
I think it's rating pretty good right now, IMDB shows a rating of 8.6 which is good especially since it hasn't come out yet
I really like Johnny Depp, what was your favorite Johnny Depp movie?
My favorite is Edward Scissorhands.
That's a classic!  I can't believe Winona Ryder was in that, she looked so different!
I know! The blonde hair makes such a difference. Whats your favorite Depp movie?
I liked Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, I loved Willa Wonka as a child.
Me too!  Gene Wilder was great in the original.
Is Keira Knightly in the new Pirates movie?
I think she is. I can't think of any other movies she's been in, can you?
She was in Imitation Game and Collateral Beauty but I haven't seen either.
I saw The Imitation Game, it was kind of weird.
I don't really like movies that are set in the war era.
Me either but I did really like Saving Private Ryan.  Matt Damon was phenomenal in that!
