You know who's  not only a great pop musician and singer but it seems a good person too?
Who you talking about.
Chris Stapleton. I like him a lot.
He seems really down to earth.
Yes he does.
I like his songs Tennessee Whiskey and Fire Away.
They are great tunes.
They were released in 2015'i think.
I think you're right.
From The Traveller album.
