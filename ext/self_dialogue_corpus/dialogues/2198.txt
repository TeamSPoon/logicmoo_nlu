Who do you think is going to win this year?
Well I think the Patriots are the top of the list. What about you?
Ehhh, I think that's an easy pick, but I'm going with a darkhorse, the Dolphins.
What? Why?
Look at what they did last year.
Like what? Lose in the first round of the playoffs?
After getting there for the first time in 7 years or so.
Yea, so what?
They did that with a rookie head coach.
That's not that impressive, that happens a lot.
Yea but then they signed all the core players that got them there and added on in the off season.
I still don;t see why you're putting them in Superbowl contention.
Well I said they were my dark horse pick, I think they will surprise everyone.
I think you're crazy and they won't even make the playoffs this year.
I think you're underestimating a good team.
They are not a good team.
So making the playoffs means you're not a good team?
No, losing in the first round after a wildcard berth does.
Well not every team cheats like the Patriots.
Cheat or not, they still win.
