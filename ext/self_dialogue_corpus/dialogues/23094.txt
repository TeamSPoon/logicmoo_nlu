What's your favorite genre of movies?
You know me, I like the classics.
I should have known, right? So what's your favorite?
I like Gone With the Wind.
That is old!
I know, but it has such a feel for the Civil War period.
I've never actually seen it, but I've seen clips from it a lot. It's in color, isn't it?
Yes, it has color even though it was a 1939 movie. The color really enhances the feel in the setting.
Was that a Clark Gable movie?
He was in it, along with Vivian Leigh and some other notable names.
I remember they had a really rich woman who always wanted to get her way and then the Civil War started, right?
She was a part of a big slave owning plantation in the South, and she was used to getting whatever she wanted and using men for her advantage.
That would be where Clark Gable came in?
Clark Gable played a man whom she eventually could not have her way with. He represented a strong character who wouldn't put up with her ways in the end.
That's where the famous quote comes in, right?
Oh, yeah. Frankly, my dear....
Yeah, that one. It had to get past the censors of that time?
It got fined for it, I believe. It probably opened up the doors to using the word in subsequent movies, though.
Yeah, because now it's used all the time, and people don't really think anything of it, unless it's in a kids movie.
Yep. That's true.
