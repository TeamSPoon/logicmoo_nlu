What's up with the Chiefs this year?
Not really sure what you mean by that statement.
Seems like they are a team in transistion.
I don't know, they're pretty solid.
It seems like Alex Smith just can't catch a break.
He's the ultimate bus driver quarterback.
Extremely solid and unspectacular all at once.
You can win a super bowl like that, but have to give him a good supporting cast.
I really like that fast guy they drafted.
Tye Hill?
Yeah, that dude stole the show last year.
He was a one man highlight.  Probably the fastest player in the NFL.
He's a real weapon for them and a great NFL pick.
It will also be interesting how they develop at QB going forward.
Yeah, they burned a high pick on a QB, right?
Traded up to get that guy from Texas Tech.
He's probably a year away from starting I think.
But the writing is on the wall for Alex Smith: you ain't the future.
They might make wild card if they're lucky, but that division is a killer.
I think they'll be bumped out of the playoffs this year.
