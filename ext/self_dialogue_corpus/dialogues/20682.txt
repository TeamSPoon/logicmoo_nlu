My husband and I just had our anniversary and we went to a movie in the Theater for the first time in 10 years.
Oh really?  I love going to the theater.  It is so much more immersive than just watching a movie at home.
I had forgotten how awesome the theater experience was.
So what Movie did you decide to see?
He let me choose, so I chose the Shack.
I missed that one.  Was it good?
It was amazing! I read the book three times and could not wait to see the movie.
What was so good about it?
They followed the book so well and brought the book to life on the big screen.
What was your favorite scene?
I loved how they portrayed the struggle that Mac had in stepping out of the boat to walk on the water with Jesus.
It sounds like a deep deep movie.
Of course the book is much deeper but they did such a good job to get to the meat of the point of story in just the length of a movie.
Can you tell me anything else without telling me the end?  I really want to see this one myself.
I can't think of anything except for specific things which might ruin it for you.
Oh ok.  Is it a sad movie?
Well be prepared to shed some tears when you watch that one.
Oh great!  I do tend to love sad movies.
You should maybe try and read the book before seeing the movie.
Ok I will do that for sure.  I have been meaning to read it anyway!
