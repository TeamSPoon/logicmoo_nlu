Do you like listening to Lady Gaga?
Of course! She is mega talented!
What is your favorite song by her?
I like listening to the song Applause.
Oh I forgot about that song! That is good!
Yeah it is the best for the club.
Have you seen the video?
Yes it is super weird but cool.
I also like the song called The Cure.
Oh I will have to listen to that one.
