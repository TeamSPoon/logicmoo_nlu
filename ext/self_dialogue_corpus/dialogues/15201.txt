Have you ever been let down by a concert?
No why have you?
Yes, I feel the last counting crows concert I attended kind of sucked.
why ? In what ways?
Well I felt the song you truly are waiting to hear like round here were re worked in a way that was barely recognizable.
That does suck. I actually feel artist should be more open to the big hits that made them popular in the first place.
Yes, they are sometimes so reluctant to play fan favorites but I don't get why.
Well not all bands are like that. Thanks goodness.
Maybe I have just had some bad luck.
If it has just been one counting crows concert experience It is not bad at all.
If only that was the only time. I went to a jefferson airplane concert this past summer.  Guess what they choose not to play?
white rabbit?
No they did play that one at least.. but Nothing's gonna stop us. It was one of the reason I wanted to go at all.
That sucks since it is one of the bigger hits for them but so different from their usual sound.
I agree it was an 80s hit for them for mannequin the movie. But being one of their biggest hits they should have played it.
Did they play rock that city? That was another big one.
Yes. I guess they played two of the three songs I really wanted hear live.
I guess they hated that song, or are embarrassed by their 80s phase like many people.
I get that , it is true they don't like playing that song. But I still find that to be wrong, celebrate what you are loved for.
I do agree with you. I hope that all your future songlist wishes come true.
