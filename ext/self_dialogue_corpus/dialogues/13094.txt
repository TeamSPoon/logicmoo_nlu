What do you think about the newest Star Wars cast?
I loved Natalie Portman in it, she was so awesome as Padme.
I agree! And what about Kiera Knightly? Those two together are just a dynamic duo.
What about Carrie Fisher as the classic Princess Leia?
She was amazing. It's such a shame what happened.
I know, but her spirit lives on in each and every Star Wars movie to come.
Absolutely. George Lucas knew what he was doing when he cast her in the original. It was an amazing choice.
Did you know that he had to get some inspiration from Akira Kurosawa?
Really?! I had no idea. That makes sense though. I can see how it gave it a more personable feel.
Absolutely! And with a ten million dollar budget, they had to make sure it was great!
