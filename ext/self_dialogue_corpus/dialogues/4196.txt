Have you seen Get Out?
We rented it last weekend.
What did you think?
I really liked it. Have you seen it?
No, we are gonna watch it tonight. Don't give me any spoilers.
I won't but I will tell you it is a nice blend of horror, thriller, and some comedy. I think you'll like it.
I wanted to see it because it has Allison Williams from Girls.
She is great in the movie. I will also tell you it stars Bradly Whitford.
He looks so old in the trailers I have seen for the movie.
He plays Allison's dad in the movie.
