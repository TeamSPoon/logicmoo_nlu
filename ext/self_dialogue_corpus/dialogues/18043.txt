If you could only listen to one song for the rest of your life, what song would you pick?
Is that a trick question?
No, why do you ask?
Because it seems like a trick question.
How so?
Any music you listen to over and over again, you'll start to hate it.
That's probably true.
So any song I pick, it's basically a song that I will grow to despise.
I guess maybe if you listen to it sparingly, it might be OK.
I'd probably pick something from a style of music that's fairly undestated.
Like Classical, maybe?
Yeah, maybe a classical composition. That wouldn't be as grating over time.
Which one would you choose?
Maybe Fur Elise, by Beethoven.
Why Fur Elise?
It's very beautiful, but it's also pretty understated compared with some of the more loud, operatic classical tunes.
I can see how that's true.
So that might have a chance of lasting for a whil before I grow to despise it.
You've got a very gloomy outlook on music.
Haha, I just don't want to listen to only one song for the rest of my life!
