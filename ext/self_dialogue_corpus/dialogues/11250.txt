Wow, did you see what Jenna was wearing this morning?
I did! I can't believe she would wear that! I think I was 2 the last time I put on overalls...
I'm surprised you ever wore overalls at all, actually.
I did, my mom even has a picture of me wearing them.. ugh.
Haha, I've got to see that! But still, I bet you wore them better than Jenna did.
Yeah, my diaper really filled out the tush! Haha.
Better than no tush! I wish I had more of a back end, I don't look good in most jeans because I need to tone up.
Oh, I don't know, I think the jeans you're wearing now are fine.
Well, they're better than Jenna's overalls. Maybe we should say something to her?
Like what? She's just going to get mad if we try to act like the hosts on "What not to wear"...
I don't know, she might be grateful. Who knows, maybe this is the begining of a career in fashon!
No way, I have style, but I could never make it as a designer.
Honey, if you can pull off overalls, you can be a fashon guru. Just go talk to her! She needs your advice!
Well, maybe after lunch I could grab some magazines and look through them with her. Point out some nice new trends...
That's the spirit! I just hate to see fashon disasters walking around.. in overalls...
Haha, yeah me too, I guess it would be doing the world a favor.
Totally, not to mention you would be doing Jenna a huge favor!
Yeah, I suppose you're right. I'll give it a try.
I can go with you too, I've been meaning to ask her if she wants to go shopping this weekend for some new tops.
Oh, that would be perfect, we can all go and help her out!
