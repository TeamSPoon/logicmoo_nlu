What was the last movie you saw?
I saw Lego Batman.
Was it any good?
Yeah it was really good.
I loved the Lego movie.
If you liked that, you will love Lego Batman.
Does it have the same humor?
Yeah, it's still goofy but has heart.
Why can Lego make such good movies?
I think it's because they actually care and it's not just a cash grab.
