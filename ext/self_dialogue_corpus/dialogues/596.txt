How do you think the Titans will be this year?
Much improved is my guess.
Why in particular?
For one thing, they are developing a very good offensive line.
They definitely have been collecting some good young talent.
It helps that they've got Murray running behind them.
Yeah, he's reminding me of his glory days.
You mean when he was with Dallas?
Right.  His time in Philly was no glory day for sure.
Yeah, what a mess that was.
What do you think of Mariota?
He's improving year after year.  Seems like a good pick so far.
Man, that guy has some jets.
Yeah, he ran all the time at Oregon.
It really helps when he scrambles.  Linebackers can't catch him.
He picked up tons of first downs last year from running out of the pocket.
I think the key with him is keeping him healthy though.
Yeah, you can't run for your life and not expect to be hurt.
I think they can challenge the Steelers to win the division.
I hope so.  I hate the Steelers!
