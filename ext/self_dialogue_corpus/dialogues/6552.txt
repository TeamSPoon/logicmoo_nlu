Do you know which is the latest Disney movie?
Yes, Cars 3 was released on June.
Would you go to the cinema to watch it?
I think so. It's one of my favorite.
Same here. I saw the trailer and the graphics got way better.
Well, that doesn't mean it will be better than prequels
True, but I think Disney won't let us down.
Yeah they never fail to amaze me.
We should go to the cinema and watch it together.
Definitely. Can't wait.
