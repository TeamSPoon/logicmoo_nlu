Did you see the Cavs and Celtics games the other night?
No, I missed it, what happened?
The Cavs blew out the Celtics by 40 points.
Yeah, that's about what I expected.
This just isn't going to be competitive.
I wanted to see the Wizards make it, but I know it wouldn't have made a difference.
Yeah, this was a Golden State and Cleveland final in the making all along.
It looked like the Spurs might have given Golden State a challenge in game one.
They were up 25 points!
I guess Steph Curry might be down but never out.
Well, the Spurs had some bad injury luck too.
Yeah, nothing you can do about that.
Do you think both teams will sweep?
Golden State, probably.
Not Cleveland?
LeBron is good, but I think Boston will steal one.
The Spurs are good too, though.
Yeah, but that injury pretty much killed their shot.
Who do you think will win it all?
Golden State, they're looking for revenge after last year.
