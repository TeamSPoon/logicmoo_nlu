Why was Harry's family so mean/
What do you mean?
His brother and mom and dad, they're all mean.
No, that's not his real family.
It's not?
No.  His mom and dad died protecting him.
Oh.  I must have missed that.
That's a pretty huge miss.  It's like the center of the whole first movie.
I guess I better watch it again instead of get distracted.
I've got a copy if you'd like to watch it tonight.
