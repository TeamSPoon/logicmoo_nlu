Hey, have you heard the new song by the Foo Fighters?
I'm not sure that I have, what's it called?
It's called Run.
Hmmm...I don't think I have heard it yet.  When did it come out?
A couple of weeks ago, I think.
Oh, then I definitely haven't heard it yet.
You should listen to it, it's really good.
Ok, does it sound like anything else that they have done?
It definitely has the Foo Fighters' sound, but I wouldn't compare it to anything else that they've done.
Awesome, I love cutting edge music.
Same here, it seems that the Foo Fighters try new things out a lot.
Oh yeah, they have done quite a variety of music!
Yeah, it's amazing to think that Dave Grohl was the only musician on their first album.
Really?  I didn't know that.
You really didn't know that?
Honest!
Wow, well he played all the instruments on the recording, and then decided to form an actual band.
That's awesome!
Yeah, and to think he was "only" the drummer in Nirvana!
Dave and the Foo Fighters rock!
