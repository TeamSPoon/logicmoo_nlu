Did you see the Bruno Mars performance last night?
What channel was it on
BET, it was their awards show.
I must have missed it, how was it.
You know, like every one of his performances.
So it was good, huh?
Yeah he stole the show to be honest.
I wish he could perform at a funeral.
Thats strange.
He just brings so much energy to whatever he does
