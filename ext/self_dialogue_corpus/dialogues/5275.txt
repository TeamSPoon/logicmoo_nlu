Have you seen that movie Big Hero 6?
Yeah, it was actually really good.
I agree, I didn't expect it to be good from the trailer.
I didn't expect it to be good either, I thought it was over-hyped.
Yeah same here, but it actually made me sad!
I know right, when the robot sacrificed himself for the boy...so sad.
Yeah, but in the end, the robot was saved by the memory card thing.
Yeah, uugh I hate how his brother died in the beginning.
I thought it was kind of funny...
Your sick!
