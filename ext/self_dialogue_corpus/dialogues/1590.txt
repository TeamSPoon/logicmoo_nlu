What do you think of the teams moving to different states?
You mean the Rams and Chargers?
Them and and the Raiders.
I think it could be good, Los Angeles has a large population so it should sustain that fan base.
I do not think the Chargers should of moved.
They did have a good base in San Diego however they never won a superbowl
The Rams did in St. Louis but they moved also.
They were in LA previously so I think they wanted to go back for whatever reason
Maybe the Chargers should of moved and Rams should of stayed.
That seems more reasonable but we are past that point now.
What you think of the Raiders going to Las Vegas?
I think it is a good move, they have a large population there to include tourism
Tourists should help make those games packed!
Gambling and Football in the same city, some people are having dreams about it.
How do you think the gambling will effect the NFL?
I think the NFL should take a tax of the winnings of gamblers.
That could be a useful solution, it could help with many things that extra revenue.
Yeah, such as making safer equipment for players
Or investigation how to treat some injuries from the game.
Both are good solution for that gambling tax, I do not think it will happen though. Casinos won't like it.
