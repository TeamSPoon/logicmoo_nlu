Give me your top three favorite bands mate in the rock genre.
Do you mean just rock in general or do you mean classic rock, like Led Zepplin rock.
I guess either one, now that you said Led Zepplin.
Okay, well then I would say Pink Floyd.
Wow. Really? Why would you choose them?
First off, the variety of music they play is pretty stellar.
How would you describe the sub genres of music they play?
I would say between psychedelic rock, to pop rock, to gospel rock, if that's even a sub genre.
Are you referring to the backup singers in the album Darkside of the Moon?
Well, yes, I had that in mind for sure. I think they used the power of backup singers very well.
