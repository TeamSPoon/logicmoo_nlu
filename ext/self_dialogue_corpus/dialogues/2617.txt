Are ready for some NFL?
Yea,I think we should go to a few Giants games this year.
Yea, that sounds like a lot of fun!
Do you think we will finally get back to the playoffs this year?
I sure hope so, it has been quite the drought.
Tell me about it! Those Superbowl's seem like ages ago at this point.
They sure do! At least we have a great quarterback and receiver.
That is true, but we need way more than that to reach the promise land.
I think we need to work on that defense a little bit. It must improve!
I agree, at least we took a defensive player in the first round this year.
That is true! He is a cornerback, right?
Yea we selected Eli Apple from Ohio State.
Do you think he will be able to come in and play right away?
I am not sure, that is the expectation though.
Some guys seem to be ready right away and others take a little longer.
That is true. Hopefully Apple can come in and be a lock down corner for us.
How do you feel about the coaching staff at this point?
I am not very impressed by Ben McAdoo to be honest with you.
He needs to get us to the playoffs this year in my opinion!
At the very least I would like to see some serious improvement from our team.
