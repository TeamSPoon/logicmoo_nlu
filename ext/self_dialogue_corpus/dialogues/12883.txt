Did you see any Star Wars in theatres?
Yes. I saw the originals.
Was it a lot different.
Yes. There were not any updates back then.
I love the originals.
Me too. They are well done.
Do you like the new ones?
Not really.
Same here. I wish they could make another great film like Star Wars
Me too. It is such a cool idea.
