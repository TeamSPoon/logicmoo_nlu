I miss the NFL season!
Me too, please start again soon.
I know! I so can't wait until the opener.
I miss hearing about Cutler's mom too.
Yes, she's hilarious.
Indeed, her & the Twitter are pals.
They sometimes ask Cutler about his mom during interviews.
I bet that never gets old.
No, he's a good sport.
All the player interviews have been the highligt of my summer.
Yeah, I was stuck on ESPN all summer. You would think it was not the off season.
Do they have any new football shows?
They don't have anything new, but they do have alot of guess NFL hosts.
Who has guess hosted so far.
Well last week they had Brown & Flacco, but they had far more interesting people in the begining of the summer.
Wait, Flacco cohosted?
He has hosted at least twice now. I missed his firt time.
Is he any good?
Yeah, he did really well.
I'll have to remind myself to look out for him next time he's on.
