You know, sometimes I wish I could go to another time period so that I could have their music as mine.
Oh really? What time period would you go to?
Well I am not 100% sure, I just know I do not like the music that is put out today as much.
I guess I can understand that.
Well what time period would you go to?
Easy, I would go back to the 70's and early 80's.
Really? Who is your top band from that time period.
There are so many, do I have to choose just one?
Okay, top three.
I can do that. Journey, the Eagles, and the Carpenters.
Now, I could listen to a steady diet of that.
Especially Journey. They are timeless.
True, I think people know there songs as much today as they did back then.
I know that my nieces and nephews still love Journey.
I am sure that you helped them into them.
Well maybe a little good music education happened. So what time period if you had to choose?
I would say probably the 50's and 60's.
Why so?
I love that kind of band,  harmony, early rock and roll sound.
I would really enjoy that kind of music too.
