How many superhero movies have been made in the last 10 years?
Do you count Guardians of the Galaxy as a superhero movie?
Of course, absolutely.
Do you want them broken down by D.C. or Marvel universe?
Marvel first, and then D.C. Universe.
Well, at least 10 with Marvel, and another 5 with D.C.
Can you name some of them?
Avengers, Captain America, Ironman, The Hulk, Thor, Spiderman, just to name a few.
Alright, How about the D.C. universe
There is Batman, Superman, Batman vs. Superman, the Green Lantern, and I think they are coming out with an Aquaman, and Wonder Woman just came out.
How many Spiderman movies are there?
At least 4, probably 5, with several different versions of Spiderman.
How many Batman movies are there?
At least 5, and again, several different actors and interpretations of Batman.
Should we count Suicide Squad as a superhero movie.
I think we should.
We've totally left out the X-Men!
We have haven't we.
That has to at least count for another 5 movies.
And Logan just came out on HBO.
