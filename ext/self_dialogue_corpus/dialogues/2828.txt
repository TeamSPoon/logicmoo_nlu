Who is your favorite NFL rookie going into next season?
I don't know all that much about any of them, but I'm excited to see how Myles Garrett does with the Browns
Yeah, as the first pick overall, all eyes are on him to succeed
Even if the Browns are the worst team in the league, one player isn't going to completely turn it around
What do you think the Browns need to really turn their luck around?
Better coaching and better front office personnel, I would guess
And a decent quarterback who isn't always getting injured would probably help
Can you believe how many quarterbacks they've gone through just over the past few seasons?
And to think they could have drafted someone solid, like Dak Prescott, who no one expected to completely take off
Maybe they'll have that kind of luck with DeShone Kizer
I don't know enough about him to know one way or the other, but I'm a bit surprised they even drafted a quarterback
They're just full of surprises after picking up Brock Osweiler from the Texans
That was one of the craziest trades I've seen in the NFL, and a pretty rare thing from what I hear
I wonder if they'll use Osweiler as their starter this season?
A lot of people were speculating that they would try to trade him away, but it hasn't happened yet
They also said the Browns might try to get Jimmy Garoppolo from the Patriots, but their asking price was just too high
I guess you don't get as many great players on one team without being a bit stingy
Maybe, but Jimmy G hasn't had much time to prove himself, and might end up being as big a bust as Osweiler was
Then again, if he's being mentored by Tom Brady, he could end up being the next Brady himself
That's a pretty big gamble to take, if you ask me, probably too high of a risk for most teams
