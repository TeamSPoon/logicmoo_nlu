i was listening to the radio the other day...
and? what happened?
well, the DJ played a justin bieber song...
that's not so out of the ordinary
yeah, but then she played a weeknd song. and then a selena song!
okay, that was definitely on purpose
exactly! at least the selena song was good

heart wants what it wants
oh yeah, that one makes me cry
