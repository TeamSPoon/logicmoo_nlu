What teams do you think will be in the Superbowl this upcoming season?
Hard to tell. There are a lot of good teams and injuries can change things.
Agreed, but if you had to take a guess.
Well I would go with the safe choice, the New England Patriots.
The Patriots? Really? Tom Brady is about to turn 50 isn't he?
No, he will turn 40 this upcoming season and he still looks as good as ever.
I know you are probably right about the Patriots being in the Superbowl but I just don't like them.
The last Superbowl against the Falcons was an amazing game. They are fun to watch.
No doubt that game was amazing. It has to be one of the most historic NFL games ever.
For the Patriots to come back from a 25 point deficit was one of the greatest things I have ever seen in football.
Yeah the Patriots are good but what other teams do you think could be in the Superbowl next year?
The Atlanta Falcons.
The Falcons? You don't think they were kind of a fluke last season?
Not at all. The team from last year is still in place and they have a good schedule next year.
Lets hope if they do make it to the Superbowl again they don't embarrass themselves.
If they make it back again I don't see any team coming back from a 20 point deficit to beat them.
What other teams do you think have a chance to make it to the Superbowl?
The Cowboys, Chiefs, Raiders, Texans, maybe even the Steelers.
The Texans? You can't be serious?
They have a great defense. If they can get a decent quarterback they could go all the way.
