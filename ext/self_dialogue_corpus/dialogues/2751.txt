The 2017 season is almost here
Yea, pre-season camps open in a few weeks
So what teams do you think will finish at the top?
I think Green Bay , New England  and Atlanta are the favorites
What about surprise teams ?
Minnesota , Dallas , KC and Oakland
I hope it's not New England  again it's kind of getting old.
Yea it would be fun to see a few new teams breakout in 2017
What's you favorite team?
I'm a huge Giants fan
Oh wow I love the Vikings were  rivals
Vikings should be pretty good
Yea, I feel like Minnesota and the Giants are in about the same place  with their teams
I think 1 or both could make the playoffs but neither is built to go really far
Agreed, It would be nice just to get back to the playoffs
Yes making the playoffs make the season feel like it wasn't a complete waste
So do you get to many games?
Maybe 1 or 2 a season
Nice I don't get to many games but I watch every Viking game on TV
Wow,  great and good luck in 2017 to your vikings
