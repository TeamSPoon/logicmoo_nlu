Have you seen the documentary Nobody Speak?
Isn't that about Hulk Hogan suing Gawker over a sex tape?
Yeah, that's the one.
I thought that whole thing was ridiculous, just a media circus. I wouldn't want to watch a documentary on that.
It's really fascinating, you should watch it. It's insane how the state court ruled against Gawker, even though Federal courts had refused to.
Didn't they bankrupt Gawker?
Yes, they closed it down. And they went after individuals in the company like the reporter and editor, and bankrupted them too.
I guess I could see blaming the editor, but the reported didn't have the final say on what they put online, so it seems bad to be blaming him.
It's so bad in so many ways. The movie explained that Hulk Hogan never had the money to fund the lawsuit.
Then how was he able to sue?
Secretly, at least during the trial, a billionaire executive was funding Hulk Hogan.
Why would he do that?
Apparently he hated Gawker enough that he wanted to destroy them completely, and he was willing to out-spend Gawker's legal team big time.
Is that legal?
The movie said that amazingly it is. A billionaire can go after any media outlet and crush them. It's terrible.
Well wait, how could Hulk win a lawsuit when he went on TV and radio and joked about the sex tape?
I know, that should have made it impossible for him to win. But this was a court and jurors in his town, and the judge even criticized online media before deliberations!
That's awful.
It really is. They said Hulk is reported to know he was being filmed anyway, it was never a secret sex tape.
Sounds like a set up!
