Could you imagine a more actiony fast and furious movie
What in the world are you on about
Making those movies more action focused
That makes no sense
How so
Imagine them like twisted metal or something
Like racing cars with guns
Yeah man
That is the dumbest thing ever it would kill what makes it good
Why is that
