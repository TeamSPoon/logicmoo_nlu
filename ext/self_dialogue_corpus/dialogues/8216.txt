How do you feel about the current state of pop music
terrible, i don't like any of these new songs
What about The Weeknd, he is doing some cool stuff lately
No, it sounds too generic.
Well what about Drake? His new song Passionfruit is easy to listen to
I'm not really a fan of rap, i love soft rock and accoustic music
Maybe you should check out Ed sheeran

He plays guitar and incorporates a lot of pop in his music
