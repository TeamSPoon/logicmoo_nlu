The Patriots, cheaters or not?
I think they are.
Bill Belichick can't be trusted to do the right thing.
There have just been too many suspicious actions about the Patriots.
Winners?  I guess cheating does pay off in the end.
They are competitive every year.
There was spying, deflate gate, anything else?
There was PEDs gate where they gave several players PEDs.
Did not remember that one.
And IR gate where they illegally used the injured reserve list to keep on players who weren't hurt.
Were they punished?
Yes, they lost a draft pick.
It seems like losing draft picks never hurts them.
I guess that tells you how important the draft is.
Yes, bad teams always draft high but most of the time still stay bad.
Patriots have been picking late and losing picks yet still always finish near the top.
It is all because of the cheating.
Cheating pays!
I really think the cheating part has been overblown they are still talented.
A great deal of their success had to do with Brady.
