What is your favorite princess movie by Disney?
I think I like Cinderella most of all.
Yes! I love how the animals help to turn her into a princess.
Helpful animals are so Disney.
Does she have a fairy godmother?
Probably! Most Disney princesses have fairy godmothers.
And she's the one who loses her shoe on the steps, right?
Of course. That's how Prince Charming finds her.
I really need to lose one of my shoes one night.
Maybe your Prince Charming will find you!
