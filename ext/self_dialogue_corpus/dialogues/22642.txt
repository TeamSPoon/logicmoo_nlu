Did you see that movie Enough?
I'm not sure. Who was in it?
That's the one with Jennifer Lopez.
Oh, the one where she was abused by her husband?
Yeah, that's it.
I saw that.
Did you like it?
I did and I didn't. It didn't seem real in some parts.
What parts?
Like when she first went to the police and they wouldn't help her.
Yeah and like when the detective guy suggested a way to kill the husband?
Exactly. You know dang well that's not how it is in this day and age.
I don't know. But she did jack dude up in the end.
Dude was a loser. All he wanted to do was control her.
I know that's right. She wasn't having it girl.
How J-Lo go from a movie like Enough to the one where she's messing with the teenage neighbor?
I know right. Probably hard to get a good role these days.
Yeah, she is getting older.
I know right. She's very far removed from Out of Sight.
Oh, with George Clooney? Now that was a good flick.
