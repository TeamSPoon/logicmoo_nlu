Do you like the Dark side or the Light?
I'm a fan of the dark side.
I wish I had storm troopers following me around.
I like how they jog around.  I like the sound of they make on the floor.
Did you like Finn as a stormtrooper?
I thought it was an interesting inclusion.  It's good to see more diversity in the First Order.
Yeah, the rebel alliance is so much more diverse.  They even have interspecies commanders.
Like the fish.
That's exactly what I was thinking.
Diversity for the universe!
