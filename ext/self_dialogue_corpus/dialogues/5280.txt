I really miss the older Disney movies.
Me too. Cinderella was one of my favorites when I was a kid.
I know! And Sleeping Beauty was so great!
Sleeping Beauty was one that I watched all the time too!
Disney never gets old either. I love their new movies too.
I know what you mean. Every movie that Disney puts out I seem to love.
I agree, it's like they can't make a bad movie! Aladdin was amazing!
I know, the soundtrack was awesome too!
I agree. All the soundtracks in the newer movies of Disney's are all amazing.
I could just re-listen to the songs and recite the movies almost by heart!
