Oh, I really love the Beatles. Nobody writes music like "Yesterday" anymore.
Yeah, I totally agree.So much feeling... Everytime I hear "Yesterday, all my troubles seemed so far away..."  I get all teary-eyed.
You too?
Yeah, our parents used to complain about how the lyrics didn't make any sense. They should give a listen to the stuff that passes for music these days.
Funny, my Dad did the same thing. But now that he's 87, he actually LIKES the Beatles!  Guess NOW he's comparing them to modern music.
That's funny.  My grandkids like the Beatles more than their parent's music. I played Abbey Road for my 6 year old grand-daughter and she loved it.
Oh, Abbey Road is such a classic. How could anyone not like it?
I agree.  What's your favorite cut from Abbey Road?
That would definitely be George Harrison's "Here Comes the Sun."  You?
I prefer Lennon's "Come Together" but "Here Comes the Sun is definitely a close second for me.
