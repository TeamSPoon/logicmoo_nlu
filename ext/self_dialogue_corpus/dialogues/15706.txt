What do you think about Metallica?
As in the old or new Metallica?
The old
They are great!
Any favorite songs?
Master of Puppets is great
What about Enter Sandman?
It's decent, but do you consider it new or old Metallica?
It's right on the line where people say old, while others say new.
Yea, I agree. It's hard to differentiate.
What is your opinion on new Metallica?
Well, some of it is alright.
And the rest?
Utter crap.  You know what Lars had said a few albums back?
Yea, he said that it came "straight from his ass"
Yea, That was exactly how I feel
Me too!
Haha!
We should talk more later
Alright, bye
