Did you see that the new Enchanted is being filmed this year?
What! No way! Do they have a set date yet?
I don't think so, but I am very excited about it.
It is one of the most relatable Disney movies ever.
I agree. Amy Adams is amazing.
She plays the part perfectly.
Beauty and the Beast is out on Apple TV now too!
I know! I can't wait to re-watch it.
It was definitely a hit and I loved all the remastered songs.
Emma Watson did wonderful as Belle.
