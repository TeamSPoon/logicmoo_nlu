Rumors here in Chicago about the Cubs trading to get Quintana from the White Sox.
Who would the Cubs give up?
I dunno, Baez maybe?
That sounds light. It'd have to be more than Baez.
What about Baez plus Happ?
That's a start. Still seems like a silly rumor.
You don't think Quintana would be a fit for the Cubbies?
You can always use good starting pitching, it's rare. This just seems like a rumor for rumor's sake.
I've heard it from a couple different places though and it would make some kind of sense.
It seems more like local media trying to make a local rumor because it sells newspapers.
Maybe, but I'm just thinking about the possibilities.
Besides that, why would the Cubs trade Baez in the middle of the season?
I was just using Baez as an example because he seems to be one of the guys always being asked for by other teams.
I can't really think of a sensible match for the Cubs to trade away if this were true.
Maybe Happ, Eloy, and some others plus cash $.
That's more feasible I think, but if White Sox make Quintana available other teams could probably put together better offers.
If the Cubs want him, there's not too many other teams that have the prospect farm to match us.
Well then you're paying a premium if you really put the pedal down on a deal. Is Quintana really a guy worth draining the resources for?
You said yourself that the pitching market was thin. I think any capable arm is going to demand a nice ransom at this point.
True, but even in a thin market there's a limit that would produce negative returns if you give up too much for too little.
