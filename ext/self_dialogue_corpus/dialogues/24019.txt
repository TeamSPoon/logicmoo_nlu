Which Jurassic movie was your favorite?
Probably the first one. I didn't really care about the sequel, the third one or the latest, Jurassic World.
Steven Spielberg really put a stamp on that franchise with the first one. That was my favorite but I really enjoyed the Last World and Jurassic World too.
The Lost World was the second one right?
Yeah, it wasn't bad for me, I thought it was really fun. The third one got a bit over the top.
Is the third one when they were stranded after the boat accident on that island?
I don't remember it too clearly but that's basically what happens. It was kind of boring compared to the others.
I did like the new dinosaurs in Jurassic World.
You're probably one of the few. Most people hated the new I-Rex. They felt the chameleon disguising and high IQ were too much.
How about that big dinosaur fish! The one that ate the I-Rex at the end, that was pretty amazing!
I thought the effects were really good. I liked the way they modernized a lot of the dinosaurs but also polished up their looks. It was very realistic.
There's another Jurassic coming out in 2018.
Really? I'm kind of interested in that now. I'm always ready to watch a new one but I keep my expectations low going in now.
Yeah in 2018 there will be another Jurassic. This is going to be called Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom.
I'm guessing it picks up where Jurassic World left off.
At least we'll still have the infamous T-Rex in this.
The T-Rex became the hero in Jurassic World!
Do you think they'll bring back Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard?
Chris is definitely back in, he's now the face of that franchise. I'm not sure about Bryce. It would be nice if she returned too, for continuity.
I hope so! I really enjoyed their on screen chemistry in Jurassic World even though the movie itself was mediocre.
