Who is your favorite Star Wars character?
That's a tough question, but I'd have to say Obi Wan.
Interesting choice.  Why?
He's an interesting character.  He's a strong Jedi, and he is a good mentor.
Do you think so?  Even though his protege went to the Dark Side?
Well, that was not Obi Wan's fault.  Who is you favorite character?
I love Princess Leia!
Nice!  She's really cool.
Yeah, she's really the hero of the whole story.  She's the one searching for Obi Wan in the original, she goes after Han Solo, and even now in the new movies, she is a rebel leader.
I never thought of that.  She's a strong character.
