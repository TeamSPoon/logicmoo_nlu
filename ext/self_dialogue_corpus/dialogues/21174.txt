Did you like Suicide Squad?
No, i couldn't finish it.
Why not?
The characters were not relatable
Like who?
The joker. He was poorly acted.
He wasn't as good as Heath Ledger.
I agree.
Why else didn't you like it?
The plot.
What about it?
It was not believable.
Can you elaborate?
Why the army went along with the squad? They had guns and large weapons.
I thought the same
Yes thank you for seeing that.
Well I was hoping it would be good, but I guess it's not the case.
There were definitely high expectations for it.
Let's hope the next comic book movie is better.
Yes, in general I like watching them.
