Do you listen to much Gramatik?
Is he the beat maker/producer?
Yea, he specializes in chillhop and electroswing.
Yea, I love him.  The only thing is all his songs sound similar.
You eventually can start telling them apart more.
It is great music to listen to while doing work or reading.
Yea, it is just so relaxing and easy to listen to.
I am surprised the genre is not more popular.
It fills a kind of strange niche.
What do you mean by that?
It is not quite hard enough for all hip hop people to like but you also can not dance to it.
Yea, like I said, it is relaxation music.
Yea, though some people think it sounds like elevator music.
I can see where they are coming from but it is so much better.
I do not disagree with you there.
What is your favorite song of his?
I like Street Soul 102.
Is that the one that sounds like a Wu Tang song?
Yep, it sounds just like it.
That may also be my favorite.
