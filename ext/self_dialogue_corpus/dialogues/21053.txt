Have you seen The Diary of Anne Frank?
Well it depends on which one.
The one from 1959
No, I haven't seen it but I read part of the book.
You would probably like it. Do you like historical movies?
Yeah but not always the sad ones.
Oh. What is your favorite genre then?
Probably horror movies.
Oh, like the "Saw" series?
Not really, those are just about gore.
True, what do you look for in a good horror movie?
I like have a villain that is relatable, it makes me think anyone can be the killer.
That makes it even scarier!
Yeah, I also like to stay away from aliens or fantasy stuff too.
So it makes the movie more relatable?
Exactly! It keeps me on edge even after the movie is over
So what's a good example of a movie like that?
I like The Strangers and Hush
Both movies that happened in cabins right?
Both happened in the woods, but they both had normal people attacking at night. So scary!
