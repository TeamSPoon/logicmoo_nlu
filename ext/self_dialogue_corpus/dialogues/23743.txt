What is your favorite Christmas movie?
Well, I think Christmas Vacation is the best although it's not a typical movie.
No it isn't I do agree though, it's a must watch.
Chevy Chase is great.
I love Clark in that movie.
Clark Griswold. Everyone knows that name.
Don't forget cousin Eddie.
Wow, that man was even funnier.
He was such a hick. I loved when he was dumping his toilet in the sewer.
Yea, standing there in his robe. What a goof.
The old people were funny too.
I loved how she put a jello mold in the box.
When Clark didn't get his bonus was hilarious.
Yes, just jelly of the month club.
Cousin Eddie really stepped up when he kidnapped his boss.
They were all great characters in that movie.
Randy Quaid was my favorite next to Chevy Chase.
I agree.
I do also like Beverly D'Angelo.
Me too and I rhink she's cute.
