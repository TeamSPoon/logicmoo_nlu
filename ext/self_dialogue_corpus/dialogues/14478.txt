What do you think of the semi-finals
It doesn't seem that exciting
I know, it is clear that it will be golden state and cleveland again
Same as last year
Do you think one is going to to be perfect
Probably golden state, the spurs seem done
LeBron is not the same but they could do it
Yeah but I am not sure they are going to repeat, golden state learned from their mistakes
Agreed, if they are down 3-1 they are not coming back
I am going to watch all the games though
Who is better, LeBron or Curry
I still like LeBron but Curry is more subtle
i think he is a better leader on the team
That is a good point, they seem to gel better
I think it is a stronger team and that is why it will go perfect
Will they go perfect through the finals
No, I bet that Cleveland will win at least one game
I think they will win 2
You wanna bet that Golden State wins 4-2
I think you are right
