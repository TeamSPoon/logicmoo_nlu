Know what movie I used to like but is now awful and distasteful?
As I cannot read minds, I do not. But go ahead.
The American Pie series.
I sort of agree. Go ahead and rant.
So, the original had the webcam against her knowledge, including some nude scenes.
True, that's a crime these days and should have been then, too. Anything wrong with Pie 2?
Well, I'm not done with 1 yet. The whole plot about losing your virginity is awful.
Why? It's a real thing guys talk about and have goals for. Girls too.
Yes, but they end up treating women terribly.
True. So, Pie 2?
The lesbian scene alone is awful.
I sort of disagree for awful reasons, but why did you not like it?
It's completely ridiculous and none of that would happen.
So, I like American Pie 3 and Reunion.
Why's that?
Despite now frowning on I-II, these are good for older people who grew up with them.
How so?
Growing up and getting married, and coming back for your reunion: it's great to see how people have changed.
How did they change?
Despite being immature still, especially Stifler, they've matured and taken some responsibility for once.
