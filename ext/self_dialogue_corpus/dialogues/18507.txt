do you know seether
they did that song with amy lee?
yes, they just released a new album
i dont really care much about them.
i just care because its nostalgic
i used to like their depressing songs but not now
fine again was one of my favorites
i used to relate to that song
i still do sometimes
i feel embarrassed listening to it
its so angsty
they wanted ot be like nirvana
they even covered nirvana songs
the singer sounds like kurt though
they could make a killer nirvana cover band
i would be tempted to see that
i wish i would have been able to see the real nirvana
me too
nirvana were so important to rock
the most important 90s band
