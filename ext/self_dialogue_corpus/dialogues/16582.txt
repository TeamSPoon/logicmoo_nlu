So what do you think of Indie music?
Eh, it's not really my style.
Really? Why not?
It just always seems second rate, like stuff people couldn't get a label to accept so they just did it themselves.
You, my man, are clearly not listening to the right indie!
Oh? Then what would you recommend?
Personally, I'm a huge fan of the band Of Monsters and Men.
They indie rock, or?
Indie folk/pop. You might have heard one of their songs, actually--Little Talks, maybe?
Actually that does sound kind of familiar, were they on the radio any?
Yeah, they were super popular.
Were? Are they not together any more?
Oh no, they are! There was just a long break between their first and second album.
Ah, I see. So are they Canadian or European or...?
They're from Iceland, actually.
That's cool--no pun intended.
Haha, you're good. They're pretty neat.
So do they sing mostly in Icelandic?
No, they sing in English. They have two albums so far.
Huh. Maybe I'll check them out--even if they are indie.
