I love to watch animated Disney films.
I do too. They make me feel good.
They give you a sense of something steady.
Yes like the movie Bambi makes me remember childhood.
For me it's Alice in Wonderland.
Disney has really made an impact on the family movie going experience.
I agree whenever there is a new movie out I go to see it.
I usually make it an event.
We plan our day around the movie.
I think that's a great idea.
