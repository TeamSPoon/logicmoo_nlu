Did you know that they are making a new Predator movie?
Yes, I heard that.
Shane Black is going to direct it.
That's right and he was in the original movie.
The original Predator was a classic.
Yeah, I think that it is one of the most underrated action movies out there.
Predators was also underrated.
Who was in that one?
That one starred Adrian Brody.
Yeah, you wouldn't think of him as an action hero, but he did a great job in that one.
