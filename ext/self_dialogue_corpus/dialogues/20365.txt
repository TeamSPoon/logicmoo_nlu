What's your favorite musical comedy movie?
I have two favorites - I can't pick between them.
What's the first one?
It's Singing' in the Rain, with Gene Kelly, Debbie Reynolds, and Donald O'Connor.
Oh yeah, that's a great movie.
I'm sure it's on a lot of people's "best" lists. It is just an amazingly perfect, funny, romantic, musical movie.
Do you have any favorite moments in the film?
When Donald O'Connor sings Make 'Em Laugh. It's a great song for him, he shows off his dancing, he walks up walls, it's awesome.
It was Debbie Reynolds' breakout film, wasn't it?
She was very young, and Gene Kelly worked her hard, but she kept up with him and Donald, which is saying something.
I loved Jean Hagan as Don Lockwood's screechy ditzy costar.
She was the best! And even though she's kinda dumb, she is very savvy about her career, and she has even the heads of the studio over a barrel for much of the movie.
What's your other favorite comedy musical?
The Court Jester, with Danny Kaye and Glynis Johns. It's far and away my favorite Danny Kaye film.
"The pellet with the poison's in the vessel with the pestle..."
See, everybody knows The Court Jester.
He has great co-stars - Basil Rathbone is the bad guy.
There is an amazing sword fight between them toward the end. It sends up all the great swashbuckler battles, but at the same time, it's a great sword fight on its own.
Danny Kaye's ability with trick lyrics is legendary.
His wife Sylvia Fine wrote all of his numbers, to show him off in the best way. The Court Jester does just that.
