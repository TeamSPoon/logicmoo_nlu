Grunge rock was a great movement.
There were alot of big bands like Stone Temple Pilots.
Nirvana was the big one, but there were alot of others too.
Mud Honey was from that era.
It's interesting to see musical genres blossom and then die out.
Kind of like Rockabilly or Motown.
Grunge is a genre that still holds cache.
Even though it's era is over, the songs still play well.
Nirvana was the most well known Grunge band.
I think my favorite was Stone Temple Pilots.
