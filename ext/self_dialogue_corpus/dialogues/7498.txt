What did you think of the first Deathly Hallows?
It was pretty good.  It's amazing to see how quickly the wizarding world fell.
Proof to how powerful Voldemort really is.
Yeah, baldy is pretty powerful.  And clearly has agents everywhere.
The cliffhanger at the end was insane too.
When Voldemort gets the Elder Wand?
Yes!  How are they going to battle that powerful wizard with that powerful object?
The parts about the Deathly Hallows was cool too.
Yeah, seeing the history of these objects.
I'd even someday like to see more on their history and former owners.
