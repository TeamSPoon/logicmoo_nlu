Do you watch superhero movies?
Yeah, I love them.
Oh really? What's your favorite one?
I'm not sure...but I did think Guardians of the Galaxy was really good.
That one was alright. Why is it probably your favorite though?
I think the characters were all so likable, and they didn't overshoot with the movie.
Yeah, a lot of superhero movies do that.
Yup, like Man of Steel.
Terrible movie.
Agreed.
What else did you like about it?
I thought they paced the movie really well too.
How so?
It never felt like it dragged, or got boring. It also never felt like it was being rushed for the sake of plot.
I suppose that's true.
Of course it is. The only other superhero movie that had such good pacing was probably The Avengers.
That was the best superhero movie in my opinion.
Yeah, they really got everything right with that one.
Either way, I'm definitely going to see the new Guardians of the Galaxy.
Yeah, I can't wait.
