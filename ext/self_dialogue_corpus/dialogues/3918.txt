Have you ever seen The Panic Room?
I do not think I have. Who is in it?
Jodie Foster plays the leading role in it.
Is it one of those movies that keeps you on the edge of your seat?
It sure Is! These people break into Foster's home and terrorize her and her child.
Sounds like it could be really good.
We could watch that one or 50 First Dates.
I am in the mood for a thriller actually.
Panic Room it shall be then!
Awesome, I will order a pizza to go with it.
