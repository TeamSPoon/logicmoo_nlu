Have you see the new Harry Potter movie?
You mean Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find them? Yeah, I saw it.
And? Did you like it?
I mean, I don't see how it had anything to do with the original books other than the magic, but it was okay.
Oh! That's because it's not really a prequel, it happens like fifty years before the books.
That explains why I didn't see any cameos, I guess.
Definitely not, it's based off of one of the text books in the original series, actually.
Huh. Well it had a lot of character for a textbook!
I thought it was just as good as the originals, myself.
I wouldn't go that far. I thought the originals had better plots.
I guess I just thought the character development was better in this one.
I'll give you that, I liked Newt more than I ever liked Harry.
Isn't Newt the best? He's so adorable!
He's definitely a shy kind of guy, but he seemed friendly enough.
I loved how he was so awkward around humans but great with his animals.
His niffler was cute. Do you think him and the girl will get together?
I mean, I don't know if you want spoilers for the next two movies.
Ah, I guess it's in the book?
Yeah, in the book they get married. They're super cute.
Well, that's not the sort of spoiler I mind. I'll look forward to watching that.
