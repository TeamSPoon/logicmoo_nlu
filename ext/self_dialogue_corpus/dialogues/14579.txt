Have you been watching the basketball playoffs at all?
Yeah! The Cavaliers swept the Raptors.
The Cavaliers will probably end up playing Boston.
You think so?
Yeah. I don't think the Wizards can beat Boston.
I think they can, the series is still pretty close.
The problem is, all Boston has to do is win one more game and then they advance.
Yeah, that is true, do you think it will go to game 7?
Probably not. I think the Wizards will lose to Boston in game 6.
That sucks man, I know that the Wizards are your team.
Yeah, but I think the Cavaliers will definitley beat Boston.
I think so, too. I think Boston is overrated.
Who do you think will win the whole thing?
I am almost positive Golden State will.
Yeah, I think so too. They are just too good.
I wonder how long they will be this good?
I am not sure. I mean if Curry continues to play for them they could be the Patriots of the NBA.
Yeah, I agree. We'll have to see.
We should watch the finals together. I'll text you later about it.
Okay, sounds good. Talk to you later!
