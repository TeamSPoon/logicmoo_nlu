Did you ever see The Usual Suspects.
Yes. Amazing cast.
Kevin Spacey at his best.
Could you beleive the end?
When it turns out to be Spacey the whole time?
Incredible. Never saw it coming.
That's what made it such a great show.
True. But you really can't watch it a second time.
You should. It makes in more fun to watch Spacey.
I'll give 'er a go!
