Do you like football?
I do. It's my favorite sport.
Did you watch the Super Bowl last year?
Yeah. I watch it every year.
That was one of the most entertaining super bowls I have ever seen.
It definitely was. I couldn't believe the Patriots came back.
Yeah, I only wish it were the Broncos playing instead.
You're a Broncos fan, I take it?
Big time. I was disappointed with last season.
I could see how you would be.
At least the Patriots put on a good show.
They truly did. I felt bad for the Falcons.
I think the whole world felt bad for the Falcons in the fourth quarter.
It's hard to say it wasn't their fault. They threw that game.
Tom Brady definitely embarrassed them.
In my opinion they allowed him to do it. They knew they would be looking at big pass plays.
Yeah, they should have used more deep zone coverage.
Definitely, you can't just allow that many big passes in the fourth quarter.
I agree. Some of the passes were sketchy, though.
Yeah, the Patriots definitely squeezed out that win by the skin of their teeth.
