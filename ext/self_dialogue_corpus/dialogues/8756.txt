What's your favorite Ramones album?
Wow that's a hard one, first three were all so good.
It's tough but you must decide, mine is Rocket to Russia.
Great choice, guess mind would have to be their self titled album.
Also a great choice, you really can't go wrong with any of their early stuff.
Definitely agree, my other half for example would probably choose Leave Home.
Ha interesting that we would all three have different choices, but I think it just goes to show how tough a choice it is.
Yeah rarely has any rock band, independent if genre had three albums of that caliber to start their career.
Absolutely and to think critics of the time were so confused by them.
Yeah no one had ever been quite like them before, took awhile to grow on people.
