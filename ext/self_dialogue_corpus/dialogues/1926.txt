You're a 49ers fan, right?
Sometimes, yeah. Why?
So what's the deal about Colin Kaepernick?
What do you mean?
Well Joe Montana isn't optimistic about him finding a new home.
You mean he's still a free agent? I'm a little surprised.
Some are blaming protests in 2016 for him remaining a free agent for four months now.
Well... that could be part of it. Personally I don't think he's getting a fair chance though.
How so?
Well he's either being blackballed by everyone in the NFL or they just don't want to see his play style.
So?
He's got a 59.8% career completion record. That's nearly 10% more than even Tim Tebow's career.
That is actually pretty dang impressive.
Yeah, so the guy is getting a raw deal. Hopefully someone will give him a chance he deserves.
So what do you think about that DeForest Buckner? Seems like there's a lot of hype around him lately.
And with good reason! Dude is going to be a defensive MVP this year for certain.
You really think so? Isn't he still kinda green.
He may be in his sophomore of his career but dude has the build, speed, and athleticism.
But wont their new 4-3 defense give him some issues?
Nah, dude knows his stuff and has the skill for both inside and outside on the line. Trust me, you're going to want to keep an eye on him this year.
