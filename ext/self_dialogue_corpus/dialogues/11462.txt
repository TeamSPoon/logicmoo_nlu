Have you ever heard of The Beatles?
I have no clue what that is.
Are you kidding?
Not at all. Are you going to stop being rude and explain?
Um, only one of the most famous pop rock bands of all time?
So...like One Direction?
No, like The Beatles. Sgt. Peppers, A Day In The Life...the Beatles!
Yeah, not ringing a bell.
You are the bane of my existence. Please listen to the beatles. They're classic.
If you say so...
