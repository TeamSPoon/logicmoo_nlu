You know who I loved when I was in college?
Who is that?
Dru Hill. My boyfriend at the time introduced me to them.
Wasn't Sisqo part of that group?
Yes he was!
Okay I thought so. I liked some of their songs.
I still like most of their music even though some remind me of my ex now.
Like which songs do you mean?
One especially is "Beauty". It's a beautiful song but he dedicated it to me.
Oh okay I remember that one!
I really loved their song "These are the Times" also.
I can hear the tune in my head but can't remember all the words.
They were really great. A lot of great songs.
I agree. Then Sisqo broke out on his own?
Yes I think so.
Remember his song "The Thong Song"?
Oh wow yes!
Back in the day we used to sing that at parties.
I remember that! Fun times.
Now I need to go look up that song.
