I watched A League of Their Own more times than I can count as a kid
Me too. And the Sandlot as well.
I don't even like baseball.
Me either but those movies were so good.
I didn't like the Major League movies as much
Me either.
It's funny how no one really watches baseball anymore
You should watch the battered bastards of baseball
It's a documentary?
Yes. It explains some of the reason no one watches.
Unnecessary roughness was a good football movie
I loved Sinbad as a kid
Yeah. Little Giants is also a good football film
I always liked Friday Night Lights.
Yes. James Van der Beek is great in that
You're thinking of Varsity Blues
Oh yeah. FRiday night lights had Billy Bob Thornton in it?
Yes that's the one
I do like that one better
It's a little more serious.
