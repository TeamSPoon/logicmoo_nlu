Who's the best hype up rapper in the game?
Jeezy for sure! Have you heard him.."I put on for my city, on on for my city."
Jeezy is up there for sure. I think Lil Jon has the best hype game though.
Yeah, "Get Low" and "Turn Down for What" go hard for sure.
Don't forget "Snap Yo Fingers" either. That was my go to song when I was getting ready to go out to the club in college.
That is a great one.
We'd be totally remiss if we didn't mention FLA-VOR FLAV!
Ha! Ha! Ha! That's true, I'm not a big fan, but he's essential hype man.
Yeah, if a university offered a Hypeman 101 course, he'd get at least a week of study.
Oh, for sure. Flavor Flav was one of the first to do it.
