Did you see the Spurs game last night?
No I did not.
It was amazing basketball.
Oh really, why is that?
Well not in the conventional sense.
Go on.
It was a defensive show.
Oh nobody likes to watch that.
Well some people do.
Okay it lacks the flashy offensive plays that make highlight reels.
Yes that is exactly correct.
Wow that Greg Popavic is amazing.
Yes he runs a defensive powerhouse.
He must be a genius.
Yes, and you should have seen the way Ginobili locked down his defenders.
Yes he usually opts to attack, harass and stick to them like glue.
Yes he is so great.
I want to watch him play like that.
You have to watch the playoffs, that is when they play harder.
Ok I will do that.
