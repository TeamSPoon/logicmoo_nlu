Who's your favorite Beattle?
Probably George Harrison. Why do you ask?
Because my mother in law is a hige beattles fan and i really want to impress her. I need to get to know as much as the Beattles as possible, so i can get those brownie points.
Well okay, i can try to help you out as much as I can. My mom is a Beattles freak as well. She could tell you anything you need to know about them.
Would you be willing to go to a Beattles concert with me and my inlaws?
Maybe, we will see. I think they're all either retired or not living right now. The only one who isn't retired is the main Beattle.
Okay we can do that. As soon as I get the money we can all go, can't wait to see the Beattle live and in action
Alright, i would love to hear "She Loves You" live and in action at a concert.
I bought all of their songs!
That's all i have in my house is Beattles and Bobby Brown vinyl records all up in my house. we can play them on my record stereo.
