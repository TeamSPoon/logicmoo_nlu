When you watch the NFL do you think there are too many commercials?
Absolutely.
I think there are too.
I read an article about that recently.
What did it say?
It said in the 2017-2018 season the NFL has cut back on the commercials.
Thank goodness.
The worst was after a score and kickoff.
That was ridiculous.
I know.
Watch one play then back to commercial.
Apparently that is something they will no longer do.
That is good.
It is.
Sounds like Goodell did something right.
He did there.
Too bad he doesn't seem to get anything else right.
No he doesn't.
He is not liked by many people.
I would be one of them.
