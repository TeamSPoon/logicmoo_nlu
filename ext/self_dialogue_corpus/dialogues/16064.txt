Who's your favorite band?
I love Fall Out Boy. I've been following their music ever since their band got together.
You mean you know their first album, "Take This To You Grave"?
Yeah, of course! They really started out as a hardcore punk band.
The first Fall Out Boy album I heard was "Infinity on High".
"Thnks Fr Th Mmrs" was probably one of their most popular songs back then.
Yeah, I think most of my friends who knew Fall Out Boy only did because of that one song.
Have you heard "Folie a Deux"?
Yes! I used to listen to "I Don't Care" on repeat during my high school years.
That was a really catchy song.
What do you think of their recent songs?
Like, "My Songs Know What You Did in the Dark"?
Yeah, or "Immortal". I personally feel like they sound like a mainstream rock band now.
I'd have to agree. They're not as eccentric as they used to be.
But it seems like the media really likes their work, and they're very famous now.
Yeah, I supposed it's alright that they sacrificed a bit of individuality to become more famous.
But on the bright side, they still produce songs that embrace their old style, such as "American Beauty/American Psycho."
Good point! That song does still capture their style from back in their inception in 2003.
I wonder if they'll release any new songs soon.
Apparently their new album, "Mania" is coming out in September!
