Have you been listening to anything lately?
Yeah I have been listening to some Halsey.
Oh is she a good singer?
Yeah she is a good singer.
I think she uses a bit too much auto tune though
I can agree with you on that
I have been listening to Lorde
Oh she is decent.
Yeah I liked her a lot on the disclosure collaboration
I have not heard it yet.
I should play it for you sometime.
That sounds like a plan.
What else have you been listening to.
I have been listening to some old Beyonc√© music.
That is so old.
Yeah I know but it is classic
Agreed.
Have you seen her in concert?
No, have you?
Not yet.
