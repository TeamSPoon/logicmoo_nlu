The Rockies are playing the Reds this evening
Yeah the Reds just got swept by the cubs.
The Reds are struggling a little bit they could use a win tonight.
Yeah but the Rockies are rolling and are looking really good right now.
Yeah they are 10 games over .500 right now.
And they are playing better on the road than they are at home. Which is impressive.
The reds are still only 4 games back after getting swept, so they are still engaged.
Yeah and it's still early, but I would like to see them take care of the Rockies this evening.
Matter of fact the Reds have lost 6 in a row, so they got to  stop the bleeding.
Baseball is such a long season, you just have to be able to hang in there.
Yeah, but you never want to fall too far behind. It's a marathon, but you don't want to be way in the back.
Yeah if they could just tread water and hover around 3 to 4 games out of first place they should be in good shape.
Yeah but that is easier said than done. They are in a tough division.
That division is tough. Especially with the World Series Champions Cubs and the Cardinals.
Yeah the Cardinals always seem to be hovering around the top.
The Reds are going to have to play awfully well to compete with this group.
But it can be done, they just got to get some timely hitting and good pitching.
Yeah but I think the Cubs exposed their pitching that last series.
True, but when the Cubs are hot, they will expose a lot of teams.
Good point. Hopefully, tonight starts a win streak for the Reds.
