Have you seen the newest Star Wars movie?
Do you mean Star Wars: The Force Awakens or Rogue One: A Star Wars Story?
I meant Rogue One: A Star Wars story.
Yes, I have seen it, it was fantastic!
I really liked it too!  I wasn't sure about the idea of a Star Wars movie that is not part of the main "episodes."
I agree, there was a high chance that it wouldn't be a good movie.
I did really miss the presence of lightsabers, but there was great action overall.
The movie was definitely different, but overall good.
Do you think this success can continue?
I hope so!  I am really looking forward to the Han Solo movie.
They are making a movie just about Han Solo?
They are!  It is a prequel about his back story?
Who is playing the character of Han Solo?
A relatively unknown actor named Alden Ehrenreich.
Oh, are any big name actors in the film?
Yes!  Donald Glover is playing the role of Lando Calrissian.
Wow, that is really exciting I like him!
He is a great actor, he is also a musician under the name Childish Gambino.
Of course, I know that!  But I think he is a better actor than a musician.
Well, he should be great in a Star Wars movie!
