Are you ready for football to start again?
Yeah I'm already watching the Packer's pre season.
How are they looking?
Good so far. Hopefully they keep it up. I would like to win the work pool this year.
Your co workers follow football too?
Yeah we have decorations up and everything once it starts and a bulletin board that shows the rankings of the different teams.
What all teams do you guys follow?
Packers, Lions, Vikings and for some reason there are a few that like the Dolphins.
Wow that sounds fun.
Yeah who ever's team wins get to have a specail work lunch provided by the losers.
So you think your Packers will take the title this year?
Yeah definitely we deserve it with all our hard work.
I like Aaron Rodgers but you know my team is the Lions so I have to say that Matthew Stafford is better.
Oh yeah right. He wishes.
I'm serious and I think my team has better team dynamics.
Well with see how it goes this seasons. Packers will wipe the floor with the Lions
We have a good line up this years and I think we will surprise you.
Ha. Not a chance. We win against the lions constantly.
We get our hits in.
Half of the state of Michigan roots for the Packers instead of the Lions what does that tell you?
