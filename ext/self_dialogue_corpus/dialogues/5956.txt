I just found out that I can watch Disney movies on Netflix.
Really? Do they have any new ones or just the older releases?
I saw some that have recently been in theaters.
Oh, that's very helpful. I don't always get to see movies in the theater that I want to see.
I know what you mean. I get busy too.
Yes, and now I can see the movies that I want to see when I have time and without leaving my house.
Would you like to come over on Friday and watch some of the newer releases?
That would be great! Can I bring anything?
No. I will have appetizers and drinks.
Ok. I'll bring some popcorn.
