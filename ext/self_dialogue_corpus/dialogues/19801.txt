Have you heard of Eryn Allen Kane?
No, who is that?
She's a singer. She's done stuff with Prince and Chance the Rapper.
I like Chance. What did she do with Chance?
She's the one singing on "do do do" on Finish Line/Drown. She also sings on the music video version of Same Drugs.
Oh ok, I like her voice.
Yea, her voice is amazing. She has two albums out. There's five songs on each album, but all the songs are so good.
What's her albums called?
Aviary: Act 1 and Aviary: Act II
I'm going to have to check it out.
You should! My favorite songs are Piano Song and Have Mercy. She has really strong vocals.
What did she do with Prince?
Prince was like her mentor. They song a song about Baltimore when the riots were happening.
She must be talented than.
Yea, super talented. It's weird that not a lot of people know about her.
Who do you think she sings like?
Mmm.. she has her own style, but she kind of reminds me of Beyonce. The power in her voice is definitely there like Beyonce.
I love Beyonce! Now I have to hear this girl sing.
Me too! You definitely should! She's my favorite singer. She's definitely up and coming.
I'm going to stream her albums when I get home.
