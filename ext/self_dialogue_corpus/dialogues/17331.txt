Hi.
Hey there.
Do you like music?
That is a pretty broad question.
Okay.  Is there any particular kind of music that you like better than others?
I like rock, blues, and r&b.
Okay cool.
What about you?
I like rock, some pop, and 80's music.
Who do you like from the 80's?
I like Hall and Oates and Genesis.
Are those your favorite bands?
Yeah I would say so.  Who are some of your favorite bands?
I like Jimi Hendrix and Led Zeppelin.
Oh so classic rock.
Yeah that's right.
My parents listen to a lot of that.
For me it was the best and still is the best time period for music.
I think the 80's had a lot to offer.
Not as good as the 70's though.
