Hogwarts must be a huge place.
Of course it's huge.  Look at how big the place is.
What I mean is that to house that many students, it must have a ton of beds.
Each house has it's own section not too mention all the hidden parts of the castle.
Yeah,would have been cool to explore that place.
Probably really easy to get lost.
Well, you'd definitely need a map of some kind.  I would just sit in the hall the whole time.
And probably eat all the food, right?
Yeah, those banquets looked awesome.
Best buffet ever!
