Have you heard the new Ed Sheeran album?
Yes, I just listened to it! I really liked the song "Dive".
That was a great song, though my favorite was "Shape of You".
That's a great song! How many albums does he have out anyway?
He has 5 albums out, including his EP.
Awesome! I'll have to listen to his other albums.
Did you know that he also has written songs for other artists?
Yeah, I know he's written for Justin Bieber, One Direction, and quite a few other artists.
Wow, I didn't realize he had written for so many other people! He's extremely talented.
I agree, especially since he performs most of his music with just a guitar and a loop pedal!
