What is the saddest scene you have ever scene in a Disney movie?
Well, there is when Mufasa dies in "The Lion King."
Classic tearjerker scene, my man.
Really, but you know I think I've cried harder with a different movie.
I think I know which because I cried too, I hate to admit it.
Which one, then, guess?
"Lilo and Stitch."
Wow, right on the money.
He just wanted a family! He learned to be good and HE JUST WANTED A FAMILY!
You better stop, if I cry I am not hanging out with you anymore.
