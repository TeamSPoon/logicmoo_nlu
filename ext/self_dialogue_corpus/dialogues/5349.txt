Hey do you remember the name of the evil woman in Sleeping Beauty?
Yeah of course I do! Her name was Maleficent. You know, I don't think she was all that bad.
Really?!? Why do you say that?
All she wanted way to be invited to the party they had welcoming the birth of Aurora.
Okay, but when she wasn't invited she placed a curse on the baby. That seems pretty wrong to me.
Well that's a good point. She is capable of turning into a pretty cool dragon though.
Yes that's definitely true. Good thing Prince Phillip was there to help lift the curse on Aurora.
Okay I take it back, Maleficent was pretty evil. I still think if she'd just been invited to Aurora's party none of that would have happened.
Well I think if Flora, Fauna, and Merryweather had done their jobs the curse would never have befallen Aurora!
That's a lot of blame to cast on the Good Fairies. And it wouldn't have made much of a movie if Sleeping Beauty never went to sleep.
