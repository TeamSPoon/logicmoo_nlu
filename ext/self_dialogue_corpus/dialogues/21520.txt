What was your favorite Disney animated movie, growing up as a kid.
For me, it's Beauty and the Beast.
That one was pretty good, but I'm more of a Lion King fan.
Yuck! Lion King was one of my least favorites.
That's crazy, it's so good. The songs were outstanding!
I liked 'Circle of Life', but most of them weren't doing much for me.
'Hakuna Matata'? That song is so fun and catchy.
I thought it was corny, and I didn't like Timon or Pumba.
I'm not going to say Beauty and the Beast was bad, but Lion King was way more beautifully animated.
I can't agree with that. Some of the stuff they did in Beauty and the Beast had never been done before. Remember the ballroom scene?
That was nice, but that was one scene.
I think Beauty and the Beast actually won an Oscar for Best Picture.
No, they were nominated but didn't win. No animated movie has ever won the Oscar for Best Picture.
Ah, that's right. But still, Lion King didn't get nominated.
Neither did Little Mermaid, or Pocahontas, or any of the others. So what does that prove?
That Beauty and the Beast is the best one!
I still think the Lion King was better. Simba is my dude!
Did you watch any of the direct-to-DVD movies they made tthat were sequels to Lion King?
I didn't even know they made them.
Consider yourself lucky not to have known, it could have destroyed your childhood.
