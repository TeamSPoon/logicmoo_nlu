Who do you think has the best and worst uniforms in the NFL?
Best uniforms? I would have to say the Lions do.
The Lions? That's an obscure choice.
I like the Blue and Silver combination and their new logo is classic with a slight design change.
That upgrade in logo was hardly noticeable. Sometimes those are the best upgrades.
For certain. When a team goes crazy with a totally new logo, it sometimes loses it's feel.
What do you think is the worst uniforms in the NFL.
An obvious answer would be the Browns, because of the colors. However, I would say the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.
At least they don't have those old creamsicle orange uniforms.
I disagree. Those uniforms were awesome. They were outrageous but they worked.
Did you like the old logo with the Buccaneer and the sword in his mouth.
I actually did. It wasn't intimidating at all and he winked, but it was detailed and unique and separated itself in that category.
That's surprising because most people hated their old logo and uniforms. Why do you hate their new uniforms?
I don't care for their new logo and their logo is oversized on the helmet.
Is it oversized. I didn't even notice.
It is. Take a look next time they are on television. I also hate the color pewter or whatever they call that.
It is an ugly color. What else don't you like about their uniforms.
The numbers look like they belong on an old 1980's microwave.
I could see that. They have that microwave or even alarm clock feel.
They need to go back old school and bring back the old uniforms.
