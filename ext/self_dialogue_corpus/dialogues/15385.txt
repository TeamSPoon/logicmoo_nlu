What ever happened to Lorde?
I don't know but I saw her on a TV interview a couple weeks ago.
Really?  What show?
I don't remember for sure, but I think it was maybe Good Morning America
Good Morning America?
I think so, I don't usually have time to have the TV on but Sunday we usually do and that's the only time I can think of.
Well, what was the interview about?
I didn't really pay attention.  A comeback song probably.
Did you get the name of it?
No, I only remember that I didn't recognize her at first and she was talking about being nervous on stage.
I would never have thought she was the nervous type.
Yeah, she said she gets really nervous during live performances.
Why didn't you recognize her?
She wasn't wearing any makeup.  She looked like a totally different person.
How?
She reminded me of the Seinfeld episode where Jerry had a date with a woman who would either look gorgeous or look terrible depending on the light.
HA!  That's funny.
She really was pretty for the most part but a little homely at times.
She usually has some off the wall, crazy thing to say from what I've seen.
She did mention in the interview that she sees colors when she sings.  I thought that was weird.
