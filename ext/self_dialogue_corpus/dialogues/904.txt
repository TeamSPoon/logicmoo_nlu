Who is the best NLF team this year?
I think the Falcons.
The Atlanta team?
Yes.
Why do you say that?
The have good returning players.
Right, and they always keep a healthy team.
I think the lack of injuries for that team always gives them a leg up.
Unlike the Texans.
Do they get a lot of injuries.
Yes, one of their star players was out.
Who?
JJ Watt.
Oh, well I think all the teams make a lot of injuries.
It is the name of the game.
Do you think the Texans have a change this year?
I think they do, they seem to get better every year.
They are more or less a new team.
Right, and soon they will establish themselves as a good team.
I just hope they can hold on to the star players.
