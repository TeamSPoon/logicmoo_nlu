Who do you think makes the best movies in the movie industry?
Definitely Disney, hands down.
Why's that?
They just have so much range at this point. They started out with hand-drawn cartoons, then added live action, and now they have animation too.
They bought Marvel too, so they're in charge of all the superhero films pretty much.
Yep, every superhero except the DC Universe ones, which is pretty much just Batman and Superman.
Didn't they buy another entity as well?
Yea they bought that Star Wars franchise.
Oh wow, that probably cost them a ton of money.
Probably, but it's definitely worth it. The new Star Wars movies are going to make them billions of dollars.
