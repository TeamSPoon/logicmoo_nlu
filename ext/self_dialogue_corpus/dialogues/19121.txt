How long have you been playing guitar?
About four years. I started on my own,  I took a couple of classes later, now I'm practicing on my own again.
Did you use a particular method of learning like watching videos or reading books?
I went to the bookstore and then to Guitar Center and browsed through several books and then I decided to buy two of them.
So by the time you started taking classes you were a decent guitar player?
Hardly! Even though the beginning exercises looked easy in reality it takes a few weeks to go through them.
Did you finish both books?
Not yet. One of them shows how to play the rhythm part of songs that use three cords at the most. That's the one I'm enjoying the most.
How many chords do you know now?
I know all the major chords, which are the ones most of the books recommend you learn first. I also know a few minor chords.
Are  any of the songs you play famous songs, something I would recognize?
Well I can play "Bye bye love" by the Everly Brothers and "Love me do" by the Beatles.
I don't know them.
You don't know the Beatles?
No I mean I don't know that song, and I definitely don't know the Everly Brothers.
You must know "Hurts so good" by John Cougar.
Uh, yes I know that one. It's been a long time since I heard it though. It looks like they're all old songs.
Yes they're old, but the reason they're in the book is because they are easy to play.
Can you play one those songs for me the next time I go to your house?
Sure.
