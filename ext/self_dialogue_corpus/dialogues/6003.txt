Isn't it weird that Disney owns Marvel now?
It is!
Guardians of the Galaxy was technically a Disney movie!
the best movie they've done, honestly
certainly the least family friendly, at least
it's really cool, though. two huge parts of nerd culture coming together.
the cartoon nerds and the comic nerds
exactly! it was bound to happen
disney is doing a good job with it's comic book movies, too
i'm surprised, yeah
