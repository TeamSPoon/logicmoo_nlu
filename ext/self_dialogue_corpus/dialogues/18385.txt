Do you like Madonna's music?
Yes, Ive alway's loved Madonna's music and her style is really edgy.
I can remember one of her first tunes "Dress You Up" it's one of my favorites what's yours?
I really like that song 'Vogue' . It doesn't matter how old you get they will always be playing it when you go shopping."
I know, it's a timeless classic- they were playing that the other day when I was at Macy's.
You know a few of her tunes were so explicit that alot of stations would not play them.
I know. I didn't really see what the big deal was about that- they play everything else.
I know, it's not as if any of her really early stuff was less provocative
I know what you mean.
They didn't hesitate to play 'Like a Virgin' or show the video
Yeah that song and video were kind of raunchy
Her songs are really original, I mean Madonna never really tries to imitate any other artists
Yeah. And if she samples other songs or their beat, you would never know cause Madonna kinda makes it her own
Yeah theres that song 'Justify My Love' .
What about that? That's one of my favorites
Well that song is sampled from  that rap group 'Public Enemy' one of their tracks
Really? Which one?
I think it's called 'Security of the First World'
I guess I will check that out later
Madonna sampled that but was very clever. I still love the music though
