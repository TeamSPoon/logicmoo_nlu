Are you excited for the football season to start?
Yes! I can't wait. Who do you think is going to win the NFC East?
I think the Cowboys will win it again. They have a great quarterback and runningback.
I don't know, I think the Redskins have a really good shot this year.
The Redskins have a tough schedule though. It will either be Dallas or NY Giants.
I don't think the Giants will be good this year. Eli Manning is getting old and they don't have a good run game.
On second thought, I wouldn't count the Eagles out either. Carson Wentz was pretty good last year.
True he was but they need help in other areas and aren't ready to compete in my opinion.
What do you think about the NFC North?
It's hard to imagine anyone but Packers winning it.
Lions were good last year and they've gotten stronger in the off season.
I think Matt Stafford is still overrated and has yet to show he can win big games.
I think Rodgers is getting older. Maybe Minnesota can step up this year.
But they lost Peterson which is going to make it tough for them.
One this for sure is that the Bears are going to be terrible again.
They just can't seem to find a decent quarterback. At least their running game is good.
Who do you think wins NFC South?
The Falcons again, no doubt.
And NFC West?
I'm going out on a limb and saying Rams!
