Can you believe it's time for preseason football in a couple of weeks?
I know...where does the time go?
Have you been watching the Philadelphia Eagles practicing? What do you think?
I am excited about the team.
What makes you say that?
I like their new young quarterback. I think he may just put a fire undef the team.
Yeah, but what do you think of the coaching?
Well, that may be a problem. I am not sure about the offensive coordinator.
Yeah, me too.
What did you think of their draft choices?
I thought they were pretty good, but time will tell.
I sure hope they do better this year. Last year was disappointing.
Me too. Do you think you will get to any games?
I sure hope so. I would like to see them play the Dallas Cowboys.
Me too. Let's try to get tickets for that.
We will have to get them early, They sell out quickly.
Let's spend a little more and get some really good seats.
I agree. But I think they play them in December,it will be cold.
That's ok, we will bundle up..
And we will do a lot of yelling and jumping up and down so it will be ok...cool!
