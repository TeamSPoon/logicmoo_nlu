Which rapper had the longest career success?
That's easy; for me it will always be Dr. Dre.
I was thinking more like Big Daddy Kane.
I like his work, but Dr. Dre has been around longer.
I think Dr. Dre is worth more, like 740 million; but Big Daddy is in the MTV best MC's of all time.
Dr. Dre won MTV awards too.
Also look at the whole picture; big daddy worked with Tupac and Biz Markee.
Dre was in the biography about Tupac.
I guess they're both good, hunh?
That's what I've been trying to tell you.
