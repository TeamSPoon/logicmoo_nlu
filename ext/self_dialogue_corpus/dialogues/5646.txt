Anna and Elsa are awesome. I love that sisterly love they have.
I wouldn't know, I've never had a sister. I was an only child.
Did you ever want a sister or a brother?
Sometimes, but, usually, I was okay with just being an only child and having my cousins and my friends.
I love my sister. I can't imagine not having her in my life. I would feel horrible if we had to be separated.
I probably would, too, had I a sister. I do know what love feels like, that's pretty universal.
Sometimes I like to be by myself, but I still want to be close to her.
So, would you be more of an Elsa or an Anna?
Anna, totally. I may be the older one, but I don't think I'm that mature.
I think you are.
