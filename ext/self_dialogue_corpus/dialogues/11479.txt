Do you think the Beatles are overrated?
No, I don't think so. Their songs are certainly popular, but I don't think that necessarily means overrated.
Yea, I mean their songs are super catchy. And to have that type of sound during that era of music must have been really exciting.
I feel like they were like the original boy band/popstars of their time.
Oh for sure. Their music kind of set the tone for a new era of Rock n Roll.
And their songs were really fun and had a lot of energy.
Yea, I feel like they were really original and were presenting something that was unheard of before.
Songs like "Twist and Shout" and "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds" are my favorites.
They're so catchy, but also a lot of their songs sounds really psychedelic which I feel like was kind of the iconic sound of the 60's.
Yea, for sure. But even today you could listen to them and still be into it.
