Have you heard of Royksopp?
No, what is Royksopp?
They are an electronic music group from Norway.
I don't listen to a lot of Norwegian music. Is it really good?
I think they're very unique and creative. They write songs with good lyrics and an interesting sound which definitely sounds European.
I'm always looking for something different, so I sometimes check out European groups. Are they really new?
Actually, they've been around since the late '90s.
I see. It's funny that I haven't heard of them. They must be obscure.
They never had any really big hits here in the United States, but one of their songs was used on a Geico commercial. You would definitely recognize it if you heard it.
Which commercial was it?
It's the one where the caveman was in the airport and he was on the conveyor walkway.
I think I remember that. The song was talking about "remind me of another place and time."
That's the one. It's called "Remind Me."
I'll have to check that out on Youtube. I liked that commercial.
There is also a female vocalist that sings with the group on some of their albums. She has a really cute voice.
That can be fun. Which song should I check out featuring her vocals?
I think "The Girl and the Robot" is a good one. My favorite one with her is "This Must be It."
I'll have to check those out too. What bands do you think they're similar too?
Compared to bands in America, I really can't think of one right off the bat. They have a very electronic techno kind of European style, but the vocals are also very good.
I guess I'll have to just listen to them in order to find out.
