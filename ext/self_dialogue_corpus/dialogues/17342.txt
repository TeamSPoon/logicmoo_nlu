Who is your favorite female singer?
Kellly Clarkson. And yours?
Fiona Apple. I like Kelly too, though.
Why did you ask? Are you looking for new music?
Yeah, I'm in the mood for something different than what I usually listen to.
Have you tried the radio? Lots of new voices there.
I did. Fan videos are a good way to find new music too.
You were in the mood for a female singer?
Yes, maybe something sort of soft and quiet, though.
Have you tried listening to Birdy?
Oh, I like the one song of hers I heard.
You should listen to a few more. I think she would fit your mood.
I will do that. I will get some mp3s.
There are more female singers I like, but I can't recall their names.
How about male singers?
You could listen to Rob Thomas. He's not always quiet and soft, though.
I like him too, I will add him to my playlist.
Matchbox 20 is good too, of course.
Of course. Looks like I'm all set for future music listening.
That's great. Let me know if you need more suggestions.
