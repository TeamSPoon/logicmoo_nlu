Have you seen Leon the Professional? It's my favorite thriller of all time
I've never heard of it! It sounds interesting though! What the heck is that movie about?
There's a professional hitman who teaches an orphaned girl how to kill
What happened to her family?
They got killed by some bad guys
Oh, I bet she was really pissed at them for that
That's exactly why she wants to learn how to kill
Oh that's sounds cool. Who is the main actress?
The little girl is played by Natalie Portman
Oh, I didn't know she was in movies so young!
