Was Hercules one of Disney's worst films?
I think the animation was bad.
The characters look like every other movie.
I know but it was just off.
I think it did terrible at the box office.
I have never seen it replayed.
I think the storyline was not that good.
Most kids dont understand what they were talking about.
One of the few Disney movies I will only watch one.
I am one of them too, so count me in!
