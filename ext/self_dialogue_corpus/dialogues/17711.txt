What kind of music do you listen to to relax and destress?
Usually I will listen to one of my favorite New Age artists.
Who are your favorites?
I'm listening a lot to Enya right now. Her music is so soothing and relaxing.
She has a beautiful voice. Very ethereal.
I really like her harmonies and the layered voices she uses in her recordings.
I like David Arkenstone's stuff.
I agree! He was one of the first new age artists I started listening to way back when.
Do you like vocals or instrumentals more?
Other than Enya, most of the new age I listen to is instrumental. When there are words, I tend to pay attention to that and not relax, ha.
Some of the new age artists I like are Yanni and Patrick O'Hearn.
Patrick O'Hearn is one of my absolute favorites. I have all of his CDs.
Do you listen to any other music to relax?
You might laugh, but I listen to a lot of Kpop.
Korean pop music relaxes you?
It certainly takes my mind off my troubles. Kpop makes me happy. It has done that ever since I started listening to it.
There are an awful lot of Kpop artists. Do you follow them all?
No, I just follow TVXQ. They're Kpop legends. That group - the duo version - was the first one I sampled, and I've never heard any other group that matches them.
What is so special about TVXQ?
They have great songs and they sing beautifully in harmony, but they are also powerful and exciting dancers. I like the whole package.
