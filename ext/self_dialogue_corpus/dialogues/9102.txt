I won tickets yesterday for a concert !!!
Really? What band is it?
The Dave Matthews Band- can you believe it? They rock!
How did you get so lucky?
Saratoga Living Magazine and Saratoga Social were having a contest for free tickets.
What did you have to do to enter?
All I had to do was "like" both their facebook pages, and then they randomly picked someone.
Where are they playing at?
The Saratoga Performing Arts Center- and I won two tickets. Do you want to go?
Of course! I love the songs "Satellite" and "Crash Into Me."
