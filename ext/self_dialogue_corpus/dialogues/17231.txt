Who have you been listening to lately?
I've been getting into Michael Jackson's music again.
He was a legend, rest in peace.
Yeah, all his music just has such a strong story.
I also like how he had so many hits that span across decades!
Yeah, I think he will always stand the test of time.
Whats your favorite song by him?
Okay, can I have three?
Sure, that hard to choose?
Yeah, I just have so many favorites.
Okay, top 3, go.
First, Stranger in Moscow.
Such a good song.
Next, Morphine.
Really? I've never heard that one as a favorite.
It's random, but I just love the beat and the theme of it.
Fair enough, and the last?
Of course, Thriller!
Ah, the classic Michael Jackson!
It will never die down, ever.
