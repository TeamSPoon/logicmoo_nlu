White Chicks is one my all time favorite comedies.
Me too. Every time I watch that movie I laugh non-stop.
The absurdity of it is what cracks me up.
I know. It's so unbelievable that anyone would mistake the Wayans for two spoiled white girls, but that's what makes it so funny.
I definitely enjoy the Wayans more in this movie than in the Scary Movies.
I agree. I think they are able to showcase their talents more in White Chicks, although I find both movies to be funny.
Really? I can't stand the Scary Movie franchise.
Wow, why?
I just think parody movies are so overrated, and they don't require much talent.
I guess you could say that, but they still manage to make me laugh.
