What are your thoughts on Counting Crows?
Counting Crows?  Man, that takes me back.
Are they even making music anymore?
Beats me.  I don't think I can really remember any songs from them in the past 15 years.
Did you know the lead singer once dated Jennifer Aniston?
Seriously?  That dude had dreads even.
I know, crazy right?  If I were dating her, I wouldn't stop dating her.
Well, when you're popular like they were, you were actually more well-known then her too.
I'll have to see if they have anything recent.
Yeah, give it a spin and let me know.
