Have you ever seen any movies with Chevy Chase?
Yeah, I love that actor.
Well, have you seen Christmas Vacation?
Yep, that's one of his best movies!
I agree, He is so funny in that movie.
Have you by chance seen the movie Vegas Vacation?
Yeah, that's another great one.
Whats your favorite part in that movie?
I like the part when his son gets a fake I.D. with the name Nick Papa Georgio.
Haha, that is hilarious.
Do you remember when his son wins the first car in his casino?
Yeah, that was too funny.
Like what are the odds that a kid his age would win a car in slots?
What are the odds he would win all 4 of those cars haha.
I don't know, but that's pretty impressive.
I know, I wish I could win big in slots like that.
Well, that's the whole scam behind it, you see one guy win so you think you can too.
I know, haha, I probably shouldn't ever gamble.
Well I'd say its okay to gamble, take everything in moderation.
I agree, It's not that bad unless you over do it.
