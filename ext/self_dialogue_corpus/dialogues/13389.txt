I just watched Empire Strikes Back.  Again.
Why not?  It's the best one,
I can't stop getting freaked out every time I see Han in carbonite.
Yeah, it scared me when I was a kid.
Sure - he was frozen, and he had that grimace on his face.
Right?  He looked like he was in agony.
But I just realized when I was watching it tonight - when Han first goes into the hole, he's handcuffed.
Oh yeah!  Then he's holding up his hands!  Now how did that happen?
Did the carbonite break the handcuffs?  I have so many questions now!
Me too!
