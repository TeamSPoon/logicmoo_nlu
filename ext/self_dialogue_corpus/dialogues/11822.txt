Do you like the Beatles?
Yeah, I love them! I grew up listening to them a lot with my mom.
What's your favorite song?
My favorite is Hey Jude. What about yours?
My favorite is Yesterday. Funny that we both like slow, softer songs.
Yeah, especially when their bouncy, poppy songs are so fun!
I love Paperback Writer. That's probably my favorite upbeat song of theirs.
I really like Ticket to Ride. It's so funny and fun to sing along.
Yes! I forgot about that song. It makes me think of the movies the Beatles used to make.
I haven't seen any of them. Maybe we should watch one together!
