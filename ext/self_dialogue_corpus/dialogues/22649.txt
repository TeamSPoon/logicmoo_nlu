Are there any good movies out right now?
I just saw Wonder Woman and it was pretty good.
Well, I'm not really into super hero movies.
Okay then, how about Pirates of the Caribbean?
I heard the reviews weren't that good.
You can't always rely on the reviews. I don't always agree with the critics.
I know, but I don't have a lot of money to throw away on a disappointing movie.
Well, Wonder Woman got good reviews and I definitely recommend it. Even if you don't like superhero movies, I still think it was good.
I guess I'll check it out. It's gotta be better than Transformers.
Did you see it?
Not this one, but I saw the last one with my friend. I have no interest in this one.
It's just your typical summer movie. Entertaining but over the top.
Yeah, like they're trying to appeal to a mass audience of teenage boys.
I think Wonder Woman appeals to a wider variety of people.
I just hope it's not a waste of my time and money.
Stay away from the movie theater popcorn and soda if you want to save money.
I know right! It's brutal!
Have fun at the movies. I hope you like it.
Thanks!
You're welcome.
