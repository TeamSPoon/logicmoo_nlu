What's your favorite movie?
Oh, that's a tough one. I guess I'd say Titanic.
Because you have a crush on Leo?
Not just because of that! I thought it was really well done.
Yeah, it did win the Oscar.
I just think it kind of had a little of everything.
What do you mean?
Well, there was romance and action and it was even based on something that happened in history.
That's true. I heard they did a lot to make it accurate.
Some of the characters even existed in real life.
Not Rose and Jack.
No, of course not.
The scene of that mom putting her kids to bed knowing what was coming always gets me.
I know, right? I can't imagine what that'd be like.
Okay, you're reminding me why the movie is about more than just Leo.
Ha! Seriously though, the sets alone make it worth a watch.
But maybe not worth the length of the watch.
Okay, you might have me there. It is a really long film.
Then again I'm not sure what I would cut out.
Definitely no scenes with Leo!
