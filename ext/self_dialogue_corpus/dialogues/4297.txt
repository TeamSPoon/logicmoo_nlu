Mary, have you ever seen Gone Girl?
I have not seen that thriller yet.  Who plays in it?
Rosamund Pike and Ben Affleck play in as a married couple that go through some hard times.  The woman comes up missing.
Sounds pretty cool.  Did they ever find her?
Well yes, but it has a twist to it.  She is not all she seems to be.
So she is deviant?
Yes , she is not the best person, she turns out to be setting it all up herself.
Does she end up hurting her husband?
No, she leaves him alone, he is the only one that really know her.
Sounds fun, I will have to rent it.
