What was the last thriller movie you saw?
that would have to be Hunger games Mockingjay II
I can't believe Peeta was trying to kill Katniss
I know, and President Alma Coin was so mean.
I know right! When Katniss shot her in the end a cheered!
me too, I was really upset when they killed Katniss' little sister Prim
Yeah, but it was sweet when Petta was planting the prim rose at the end
yeah it was. I really didn't expect Petta and Katniss to have kids.
Yeah that was kind weird. What a messed up world
I know. But what an action packed series
