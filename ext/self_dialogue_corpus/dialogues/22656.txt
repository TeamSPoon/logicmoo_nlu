What do you think of the New Transformers?
I can not believe they are still making them.
Mark Whalberb still draws a crowd.
But, I mean come on how many are there now?
I think six.
That is coming close to the amount of Fast And Furious movies.
I think it is the action that draws them in.
I only watched the ones with Shia Lebouf.
I thought the brought a nice touch to the series.
Right, then they sent him off to college and now he is not more.
I wonder if he will ever come back to the series?
No, I do not think so.
This one has some of the good guys going bad.
I know I could not understand that.
I just can not see Peter Cullen as bad.
Who is that?
That is the name of the guy who play Prime.
I always wondered who played him.
He did him in all the animated movies too.
I like that they kept the same voices in all the universe.
