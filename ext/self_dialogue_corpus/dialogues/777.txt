Do you think the raiders will be as good as they showed last year?
If Derek Carr can bounce back from his injury,yes I do.
He broke his leg right?
Yes,he broke his fibula.
That's a severe injury.
Yes it is.
Didn't they get marshawn lynch?
Yes they did.
Yes they did.
That's a big addition.
They also have amari cooper and Michael Crabtree.
I don't think offense is a problem.
No,but defense might be.
They addressed the secondary heavily though.
Right,and the rookie Eddie vanderdoes could be a good defensive tackle.
He should bolster the defensive line.
They are still weak at linebacker.
They could use help there.
Fox has them winning over 9.5 games.
I can see that.
