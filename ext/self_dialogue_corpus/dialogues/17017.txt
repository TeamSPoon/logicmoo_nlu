You have some odd choices in music  on here.
Like what?
"Let it go" from "Frozen."
Okay.
"Call Me Maybe" from Carly Rae Jepsen.
I fell in love with that song when the Olympic swim team lip synched during their plane ride to China. I loved that video.
"Breathe" by Faith Hill.
Hey! It's a nice song.
Granted, just a little odd for an almost fifty year old man.
I know. Told my wife I think I'm turning into a twelve year old girl.
Based on your song selections, I wouldn't doubt it. Oh, here's another "I need a hero." The version from the "Shrek" movie.
I loved the original version. But I like the new one better.
You really are becoming a twelve year old girl.
I know. It's kinda cool.
So, you got any other songs on here that I can embarrass you with?
Hey, I'm not embarrassed. It's what I like. And that isn't all that's on there.
Yeah, I see your large Elton John and Billy Joel collection.
Did you see my Frank Sinatra collection?
Oh. Missed that.
Yeah, I'm not just a twelve year old girl. I'm also a seventy year old men I have very ecclectic tastes in music.
