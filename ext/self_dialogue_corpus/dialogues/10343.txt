Do you like Rush Hour?
Who is in that one?
Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker
Oh, that is a very funny movie
Have you seen the second one?
I think so.
Do you like part 1 or 2 better?
I prefer the first one.
Why is that?
I think the bad guy is better. That where he pretends to be a cop and kidnaps the girl is really memorable
