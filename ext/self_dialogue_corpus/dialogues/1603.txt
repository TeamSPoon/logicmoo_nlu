You know I wasn't much of a NFL football league fan until I got in the office pool.
You're kidding! Why?
Just never had much interest in watching a bunch of guys chasing a piece of rubber people call a football.
You mean pigskin don't you? (laughs)
Whatever! I spent my Sundays making money by betting on the NFL teams.
If you didn't know or cared to know anything about the NFL, how did you know who or what team to bet on?
I had to learn the colors of the NFL uniforms.
You didn't know the NFL team colors but you bet  on them anyway?
Yes! I had a system and the system used colors.
What color is the New Orleans Saints team?
Black and Gold.
Chicago Bears?
Blue and Orange.
Green Bay Packers?
Green and Gold but everyone knows that don't they?
I guess but remember you didn't until you got in your office pool right?
Right? I didn't know none of the NFL's players or coaches either.
So how could colors help you pick NFL's team winners.
I always bet on the team who's colors were primary colors. I never bet on secondary colored uniforms.
You're kidding right? None of this true right? Well I'll be a monkey's uncle! Get outta here!
