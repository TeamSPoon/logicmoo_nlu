What is your most memorable Steeler game
2008 AFC Championship against the Ratbirds.
Why? It wasn't the Super Bowl!
My brother-in-law and sister are fans that crappy team
Wasn't that played in Baltimore?
Yup. Nosebleed seats surrounded by Rats.
So what happened to your family?
Well, they left when the Ratbirds got the ball with us leading 16-14. Superstition ruled their motives.
Scarey McScareys, huh?
Yup...lol.
Everytime they went to the bathroom during the game something good happened for us, so...
So when Pittsbugh intercepted the ball, where were they?
They were on the ferry going home.
Wow...unbelievable
Me, I was waving my towel wildly amongst all those Rats.
That had to be dangerous...
Nah. They were too depressed to do anything to me
True, had to be. I would have been to scared to do that
You only live once man,,,lol
Goodness gracious man, you're dangerous
