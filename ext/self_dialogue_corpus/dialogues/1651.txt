I'm ready for the football season to begin - the Pats are going to take it again!
I don't think so. It's way to early to predict a Super Bowl winner.
So if you don't like the Patriots, who do you like?
I've always been partial to the Tennessee Titans.
Are you kidding me!  They don't have any defense. I don't think they could even beat the Browns!
Hey, the Browns aren't so bad. And their fans love them!
Yeah, but have you even been to Cleveland? The Browns are about the only thing there to love!
Maybe, but when it comes to a football town, Dallas is the winner
I have to admit you're right. The Cowboys also have rabid fans, even when they have a bad season.
That's the Landry and Staubach legacy at work!
Landry was hands-down one of the best NFL coaches ever. He could take on any of today's teams!
He sure knew talent when he saw it. The Cowboys were THE team to watch back then.
Today, it's definitely the Patriots who are in the spotlight all the time.
Yeah, kind of reminds me of the Joe Montana days with the 49ers. He could do no wrong.
Or John Elway with the Broncos.
And today we're stuck with guys like Colin Kaepernick and Tom Brady.
Nothing wrong with Brady, my friend! But Kaepernick - I'll give you that one.
I just wish he'd stick to football and stay out of political issues.
Joe Montana must be rolling his eyes!
Well, at least Kaepernick's a free agent now. Interesting to see if anyone picks him up.
