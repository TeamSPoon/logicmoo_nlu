I was thinking today about first round busts in the NFL.
There are plenty of them to consume your thinking.
Yes. For sure. Wonder how many first round busts there will be this year.
It will be interesting to see. I'm guessing that Trabisky player may be a bust.
I could see that. So many quarterbacks have been busts in the past.
Akili Smith, Tim Couch, Johnnie Manziel, and the bust of all busts Ryan Leaf.
Ryan Leaf. Wow. What a shame the way his career turned out.
He brought a lot of it on himself with his attitude and locker room conduct.
For sure, but I still feel bad for the guy a little bit. Remember the choice between Leaf and Manning.
Their careers couldn't have been more polar opposite.
Imagine if the Colts picked Leaf instead.
I think it wasn't as hard of a choice as the media made it out to be. A household name, Manning, versus a guy who nobody heard of till his final year of college football.
True. I think a lot of people believed they were equally talented.
I think the talent was there with Leaf, he just never adapted to the NFL game pace.
Unfortunate. There were other big quarterback busts in the 1990s that get overshadowed.
Akili Smith. Ha ha.
Akili Smith is definitely one of them.
He was another quarterback nobody heard of until his final year of college.
The Bengals really had a lot of busts in the nineties. No wonder they haven't won a playoff game since 1991.
That's part of the reason.
