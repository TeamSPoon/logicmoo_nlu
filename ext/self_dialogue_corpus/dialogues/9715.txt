So how do you feel about Eminem's latest album?
Which one was his latest?
The Marshall Mathers LP 2 was the one.
Wait, so was that like a sequel to the first one.
Basically, that's what it was supposed to be.
Did you think it was as good as the first.
I really liked it a lot. I thought it felt like a more mature, focused version of the first one.
That definitely sounds interesting to say the least.
It is. Definitely check it out if you can.
I'll get on YouTube later today.
