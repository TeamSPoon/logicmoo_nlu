Whats your favorite movie series?
Harry Potter hands down.
Really?  I've seen the first one a really long time ago but I never finished it.
You have to!  I know there are a lot of them but everything about them is great.
How many movies are there?
Well, there's eight Harry Potter movies but that new movie Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them takes place in the same universe.  It happens before Harry Potter.
So should I start with the first Harry Potter or that new movie?
You should definitely start with Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.  The new one just has nods to the others that you wouldn't get if you hadn't watched them first.
Does it have any of the same actors?
No, not that I know of.  Speaking of that the casting is amazing.  Daniel Radcliffe was spot on playing Harry Potter.
