Do you remember watching Full Metal Jacket?
No I missed that one, I know the name.
It is surely one of the best war movies.
What makes it so good?
It shows the bootcamp before young soldiers go to war.
Oh that is the whole scene of the film.
That is first half.
Oh and the second is the war.
Yes but it is like watching two completely different movies.
Which one is better.
The second half is so much different.
So which one is better?
The first half is one of the most amazing pieces of film ever made.
Wow it is that special?
Yes even some of the lines were not scripted, it is authentic.
Wow that is unique.
Yes it is truly a masterpiece.
Wow then I look forward to watching it.
Yes there is a lot going on in that film.
Great, I look forward to watching it then.
