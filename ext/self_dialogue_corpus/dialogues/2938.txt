What NFL stadium is the coolest?
I think the Eagles stadium is pretty neat.
How so?
Well, they've got incredible food and seating.
Did they just build that stadium?
Not too long ago.
When did it open?
Well, it was built in 2001, and it was renovated in 2013 and 2014.
That is pretty recent.
They have Wi-Fi and update score boards there.
That is cool.
What do you like best about the upgrades?
I think the seating is fantastic with great views of the game.
Can you see the cheerleaders?
You can see it all.
That's neat.
I hope to take my kids to a game sometime.
That would be fun.
It's a dream of mine to have my son play in the NFL.
Must be a common dream.
