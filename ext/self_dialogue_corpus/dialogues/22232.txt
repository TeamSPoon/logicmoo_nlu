Have you seen the movie How to Be a Latin Lover?
No, I haven't even heard of it. What's it about?
It's about a guy that gets dumped by his wealthy elderly wife and becomes a giggolo.
Oh my, that sounds entertaining what did you think?
I read reviews before I went and they weren't that great, but I actually liked it.
Who is in it?
It stars Salma Hayek and Eugenio Derbez.
I haven't heard of Eugenio Derbez, but I really like Salma Hayek.
Yeah she's great, especially in her movies from the 90s.
I guess this is the most recent movie she's been in.  Was it funny?
Yeah it was a really good satire. It was nice to just watch a movie mindlessly.
That does sound nice. How was Derbez as an actor?
He was great.  He and Salma have wonderful chemistry, so it was nice to watch how natural they were on screen together.
Yeah that does sound nice.
It did have a lot of cliches, which I am usually sick of, but I liked them this time.
The whole title itself is a cliche, so I can understand that.
I highly recommend it though.  It would be great to see with your girlfriend.
I'll talk to her about it tonight.
Tell me if you see it!
Okay, I will.
