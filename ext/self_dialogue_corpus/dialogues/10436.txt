Hey How are you doing today?
I am doing great! Yourself?
Awesome, I stayed up late last night watching a movie called The thing called love.
Oh, I heard of that movie ?Is it old ?
Yes, it is fairly old now.
Who is in it?
The late Rive Phoenix, Samantha Mathis, and Sandra Bullock
oh, I remember River Phoenix so cute and so talented.  What a tragedy.
I think it was made right before River Phoenix died and before Sandra Bullock became famous.
Sandra Bullock is an great actress.  What is it about?
A big city new york girl follwoing her dreams to be a country star.
Did they play any good country music?
Yes Trisha Yearwood was in a lot of it with her songs.
oh, what music does she write ?
She wrote the song I can't understand.
Oh, I know that song.  I love that song!
She also has the song A perfect love out now.  But its not in the movie.
That is a great song I really like that one too!
You should definitly look into streaming The thing called love its underated.
Ok, I will look into watching that this weekend. Thanks !!
