Have you ever seen the original Terminator film?
Of course! It's one of the best action movies of all time.
Really? Would you say it's the best of the Terminator movies?
It is my personal favorite.
What about Judgement Day? Everyone says that one is better.
It has better special effects and action sequences but doesn't have the charm of the original.
How do you mean?
The low budget, sci-fi setting was a lot more appealing to me than the more polished Judgement Day.
I see. I thought the first one was a little bit campy.
That's part of the charm!
