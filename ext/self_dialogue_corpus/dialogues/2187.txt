Do you watch football?
Every sunday.
Do you like Tom Brady?
Yep, he plays for my favorite team.
Mine too.
Do you think the patriots will win it all this year.
I think so.
Why?
Not many teams that can go toe to toe with them.
That's true.
Who do you think can beat them?
Broncos.
Why them?
One guy, Peyton Manning.
I'm not so sure.
He can pull off passes that even Brady can't.
He is a very good player.
His injury didn't seem to slow him down much.
He's still got a cannon.
Other than that team I don't think so.
