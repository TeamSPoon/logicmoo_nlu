Have you seen any Harry Potter movies?
Of course, I am a huge fan!
Oh sweet! Me too. Which movie is your favorite?
I would probably have to say Prisoner of Azkaban.
That's definitely a good one. Are you a big Sirius Black fan?
No. I mean I like him, but I really like Lupin.
Lupin is a great guy. Is he your favorite part of the movie?
I'm not sure. He's one of them anyway. I love the scene when they are practicing fighting Boggarts.
Yeah really. That one is funny. Snape dressed up as Neville's grandma had me laughing so hard.
Ha! "Riddikulus" and Draco says "This class is ridiculous." Too funny!
