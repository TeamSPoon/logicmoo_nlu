I used to really like country music. But lately it just doesn't feel the same.
I know what you mean. It's basically pop music now.
Basically, but it's like slightly outdated pop music that has a slight twang to it.
Exactly. I wish I could find some real country music to listen to, like some Sammy Kershaw.
I loved his songs years ago, what about Dwight Yoakum?
Yes, Dwight Yoakum was fantastic. His song Try Not to Look so Pretty was one of my favourites.
But that was so long ago.
It was. I also really liked Gary Allen.
I liked him too, but only his earlier stuff, he got weird after awhile.
I forgot about that. Yeah.
I heard the new Faith Hill and Tim McGraw duet, it's terrible.
It is terrible! I used to love their songs together.
Me too. And their solo stuff, but now I prefer his acting over his music.
It's sad.
You know I have had some luck listening to artists classified as folk or bluegrass.
That makes sense, they are related to country and not as prone to the pop influences.
So who do you suggest?
The Avett Brothers, Those Darlins, Old Crow Medicine Show. Those are some of my favourites.
I'm still going to listen to my old Lyle Lovett.
You should. Lyle was great.
