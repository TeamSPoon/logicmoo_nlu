I just watched the Phantom Menace on TV last night.
Is that the first time that you had seen it?
No, I saw it on opening night back when it first came out.
Me too. I remember calling 1-800-moviephone to find the nearest locations!
I remember that service!
Yeah, time really flies.
What did you think of the movie on this go around?
It seemed more cute than realistic.
I agree. After seeing how realistic and gritty Rogue One was, the prequels seem like they were meant to be watched by kids.
I can see that. But seeing Darth Maul still makes me cringe every time I see the first prequel!
