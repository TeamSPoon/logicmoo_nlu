Have you seen the new Guardians of the Galaxy?
Yes!  I loved it-- great movie, awesome soundtrack, and Stallone is in it.
What was your favorite part?
Too many good parts to name-- it's a brilliant mix of comedy, action, and drama.
I can agree with that.  Talk about taking some secondary characters, and making them super popular.
James Gunn is a great director.  I really liked his movie Super, too.
Yeah, that's probably Rainn Wilson's best movie role.
And, it has Juno in it.
Haha, you mean Ellen Page?
Yeah, haha.  I loved her as Kitty Pryde.
Kevin Bacon is in Super too, and would later be Sebastion Shaw in X-Men first class.
And, Michael Rooker, who was Yondu in Guardians.
Everything comes full circle.  You like Michael Rooker?
Yeah, he's solid.  I liked him in Mallrats, and Days of Thunder, but his role as Yondu is my favorite.
How about Chris Pratt, huh?
I know, he went from a small name actor to one of the biggest stars in Hollywood.
And, how about Dave Bautista?
Guardians definitely made his acting career.
No doubt-- pro wrestlers don't typically make a lot of good movies.
Except the Rock.  He's one of the biggest stars out there.
