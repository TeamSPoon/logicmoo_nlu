Have you listened to many alternate recordings of Beatles songs?
Nope, can't say I have. I've only listened to regular single and album versions.
Ah, for shame, you're missing out.
Are there a lot of alternate versions out there?
Yup, there are a ton. I'm listening to an alternate version of "I'm Looking Through You" which is super delightful.
That's a great song. Is the alternate version much different?
The melody is the same, but the arrangement is quite different.
That's probably my favorite kind of alternate version.
Me too! Demos and early versions are fun, but I like when the arrangement is totally different.
I see there's an album called Anthology that has a ton of alternates. I'm gonna give it whirl!
