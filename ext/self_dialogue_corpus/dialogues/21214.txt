I saw that new medieval movie yet?  It was really good.
Medieval?  Do you mean King Arthur?  I haven't seen it yet but I plan to.
My favorite old movie was on TCM this week.  Have you ever seen "Philadelphia Story" with Katharine Hepburn?
I have never seen that one.  You must really love it.
Did you see the new Marvel movie?  I loved it!
"Guardians of the Galaxy 2?"  I saw it.  It was awesome!
This weekend, I know what I want to do.  I want to see "Alien!"
That doesn't scare you?  Just watching the trailer made me scream.  I may skip that one.
Two more weeks to go and Captain Jack Sparrow is back!  Aren't you excited?
They made another "Pirates of the Caribbean" movie?  I didn't know they made another one.
Have you ever just curled up and watched old movies all day?  That is one of my favorite things to do.
I like new movies, but I do like "12 Angry Men".  That was a great oldie but goodie.
What did you think of the live action "Beauty and the Beast?"  Did you like it or no?
I thought it was great.  I don't understand what all the fuss was about.  It's 2017.  Who cares if they implied a character was gay.
My family and I watched "Boss Baby" the other day.  I thought I wouldn't like it, but I really did.  I laughed so hard.
My kids wanted to see it, but there wasn't time.  When it comes out on On Demand we will have to check it out.
I swear, I could watch the trailer for "The Last Jedi" over and over and not get bored.  I can't wait for Christmas.
I read that it was viewed 3,000,000 times the first day it was released.  I can't wait to see it.  I will miss Carrie Fisher in the next ones.
We binge watched all the "Indiana Jones" movies the other day because my daughter's soccer got rained out and she had never seen them.
What a great way to spend a rainy day.  I would spend a day with Harrison Ford if given the chance!
