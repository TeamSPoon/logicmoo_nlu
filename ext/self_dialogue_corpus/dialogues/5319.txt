I hear that Disney is doing a live action version of Mulan.
Really, when is it supposed to come out.
2018, I think.
Oh, I wish it was sooner, I loved the Beauty and the Beast live action movie.
I wonder who will be in it.
I don't know, but I am sure they will find people that fit the parts.
I hope they include some of the musical numbers.
I agree, they make the movies more fun!
I hope they make a lot more live action movies.
Me too, they are so much fun!
