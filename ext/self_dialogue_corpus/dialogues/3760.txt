Have I mentioned that 'The Prestige' is my favorite movie?
No, I never knew that you loved that film so much.
Well I've seen it over twenty times.
What makes you love it so much?
It's got tons of great actors in it, and the mood and tone of the movie is so eery.
It does kind of have a spooky atmosphere.
I love most Christopher Nolan films for that reason, and the music is haunting too.
Now you're making me want to watch it again.
I'm probably going to have to watch it again tonight when I get home.
Well I'll most likely wait longer than that, but I definitely want to view it again to see if I missed anything the first time around.
