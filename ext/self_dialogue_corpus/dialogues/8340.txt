I was really surprised to see how great Ariane Grande is.
I did not even know she could sing so well.
I loved her new one.
Side to Side?
Yes, it was a really great summer jam.
She is actually a really skilled vocalist.
I heard that in her song, Beauty and The Beast.
It is nice to see a pop star with such a vocal range for once.
She is far better than most of the tv stars turned pop stars.
I think Brittney Spears did well, after the Mouse club.
