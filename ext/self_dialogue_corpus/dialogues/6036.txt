What kind of Disney movies do you like?
I grew up on their animated films. I saw all their live action movies in the 60s too, but those are pretty corny now.
I like the direction they went with their more action oriented live action, like Pirates of the Caribbean.
That first Pirates movie was such a pleasant surprise! I thought it would be awful, but I think it's marvelous.
Johnny Depp, he is amazing.
He's just one of the terrific elements of that movie. I love the music and the production values too.
The rest of the Pirates movies were not as good, I don't think.
The second one was okay, but yea, then the series kind of went off the rails.
Have you seen the latest one?
Not yet, but I'll give it a chance when it comes out on DVD.
