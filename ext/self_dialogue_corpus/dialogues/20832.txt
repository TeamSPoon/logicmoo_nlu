Who do you think makes the best movies?
Definitely Disney!
Universal Makes a lot of good ones too.
Yes they do , like The new one Despicable Me 3.
Did you know that the first movie Universal produced was in 1912.
No I did not know that.
That is over 100 years ago.
They must have seen plenty of movie stars.
The produced so any movies like Back to the Future, Howard the Duck and hundreds more.
And Child's Play.
That's right.
I hate that movie.
I hate that Chucky doll character. He is scary.
And mean. I would never want that doll.
They did Bride of Chucky too.
Boy they were quite a pair.
I know.
I wonder what they will come out with next.
I hear they are making a pokemon movie in the future.
I heard that too, in about five years.
