I just watched The Shining made in 1980. Have you seen it before?
Oh, yes I have move than once.
Jack Nicholson is perfect for the part that he played.
I can't imagine anyone else playing that part.
It really scared me the first time I saw it. The acting was so good it seemed real.
I agree, the acting seemed effortless. Great actors in this one.
What about when Jack has typed Red Rum over and over.
That was so creepy. It was great.
Then of course there is the famous ax in the door scene.
That scene is hands down one of the best most iconic scenes in horror history.
