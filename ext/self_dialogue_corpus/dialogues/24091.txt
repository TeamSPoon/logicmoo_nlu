I just saw the movie Pafum.
Oh? Where?
On TubiTv on my smartphone.
it's about perfume?
yeah, but it's a really good movie about a serial killer who kills virgins to capture the scent
What?
starts off when just born and the Mom tried to kill it because she's poor
gory
yeah , well he is sent to a orphan house  - and the little kids tried to kill the baby.
sounds sad
well yeah, in the beginning but they are giving you background
so when does it get interesting?
when delivering leather to a parfum maker he begs to be his slave
slave?
Well yeah, better to be a slave of a parfumer than of leather making
so what's so great about this movie?
Has Dustin Hoffman in it as the parfumer
so, what, Rainman sucks
and the other dude that a really good actor is the guy in Die Hard
The German dude?
