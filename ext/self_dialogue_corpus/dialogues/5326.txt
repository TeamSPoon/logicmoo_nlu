What do you think the next Disney movie will be?
No idea, they seem to be going more towards animal movies.
Yah your kind of right!
Well maybe they will bring out some more classics?
Which old ones did you enjoy the most?
I loved little mermaid, and Beauty and the beast.
Gastion, is such a joker in that movie.
Right its really crazy how he already has so many ladies after him but really wants bell!
He think she is beautiful!
Thats why they call the movie that!
