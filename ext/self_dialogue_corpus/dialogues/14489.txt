Are you enjoying the NBA playoffs so far?
Not really, there have not been enough competitive games.
I agree, hopefully the finals makes up for it.
I sure hope so, LeBron and the warriors are playing so well.
It could be a very historic match up.
Are you a fan of either team?
No, my team didn't even make the playoffs.
Same here, I do really like Stephen Curry though.
Me too, I liked him all the way back when he was in college.
Are you looking forward to the draft?
Absolutely, it is one of my favorite events of the year.
I really like Lonzo Ball despite his dad.
I'm more a fan of the players from Kentucky as I root for them in college.
Lonzo sure struggled against them in the tournament.
He certainly did. I think Fox will be a better pro than him too.
Do you play basketball as well as watching it?
I do, I live by a park and play multiple times a week.
That's awesome, I haven't played in too long.
You should really get back out there, its too much fun not to.
Maybe I'll go and try to find a pick up game later this week.
