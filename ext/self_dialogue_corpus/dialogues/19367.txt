when is beck releasing the new album
he was supposed to release in october
so did he just postpone it?
they just didnt say anything about it
really?
i heard chance was supposed to be in the album
but he backed out?
chance did.
how come?
he was supposed to appear in the wow single.
so why did he back out
because of religious reasons, i think
chance is a christian
yeah, but beck is a scientologist i think
thats weird. do you know if the album is done
i believe it is.
so its just the labels postponing it
either that or beck wasnt happy with it
like he wanted to create new songs?
maybe
