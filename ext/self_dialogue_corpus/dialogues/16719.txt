Did you ever do band camp in high school?
Yeah, I was in marching band for all four years.
So, are the stories true?
You know ... the American Pie stories.
Ahh, those. Umm, sort of.
What is and what isn't? I have a kid joining.
Well, the friendships that develop surrounding music are really strong, since it brings us all together.
That's boring. Tell me about what I need to hear.
Well, the band camp bus is basically sex ed.
How so?
There are chaperones but they can only do so much. On the way home from competitions and games it's makeout central.
Really?
Yeah, but it's no different than any other group. Get a ton of teenagers together and put them in an enclosed space, guess what'll happen?
No actual sex, though, right?
Shouldn't be. There's a "heads up" rule on the bus.
Good.
We pretty much saw each other changing all the time.
So, high school music programs are sex ed?
Basically. But the amount and quality of music we play is great. Kids are in it for the music, not the sex.
Thanks, I think I feel better, but I am not sure.
