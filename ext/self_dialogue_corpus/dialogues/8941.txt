Hey, do you like Pavement?
Yeah, dude, one of the best bands of the '90s
Yes, yes indeed. Malkmus is a genius
And he really couldn't care less about the public's opinion
I know, right? Just straight up doin' his thing
And all the other band members
Yes, all just chilling and Ibold always grooving
To combat Malkmus's bouts of disgust with being together
Yeah. Imagine what their music would've become if they didn't split up
Yeah, it is too bad for us. But I'm sure they don't care
