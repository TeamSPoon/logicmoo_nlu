How do think the Steelers will do this year?
Pretty much the same as last year.
So you think they'll make the playoffs.
Of course. Their offense is still one of the best in the NFL.
Do you think they'll make it to the Super Bowl?
Probably not. New England is still in the AFC and they are well, good and lucky.
Yeah, they really have a difficult time with New England.
Don't remind me.
Do you think their defense has gotten any better.
For sure. Their secondary is still young and getting better all the time.
I thought they improved a lot last year. I agree.
They still have a long way to go on defense, but I'm happy with the progress.
Do you think New England wins the AFC again.
Of course. Unless Tom Brady decides to retire mid season.
He's almost 40. He isn't slowing down any time soon.
Unfortunately. We will still hear from Tom Brady for at least 2 to 3 more seasons.
Peyton Manning deteriorated when he got close to 40. Wonder why Brady hasn't.
Probably because he releases the ball so quickly and never gets hit.
That's true. He never gets hit.
Last time he got injured, they made a special rule about not hitting below the knees. He's too protected of a player.
