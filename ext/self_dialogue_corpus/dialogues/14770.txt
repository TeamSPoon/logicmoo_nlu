What is your favorite comedy?
I would have to go for Ricky Bobby.
Taladegha Nights?
Yes, about racing.
The Nascar film. Sasha Baron Cohen was in it right?
Yes, pre-Borat. He was kind of the bad guy, but nor really.
I like the part where he tries to make Ricky Bobby say he likes crepes.
And the other guy calls them "Really, really thin pancakes".
Right, so funny.
Then he breaks Ricky's arm.
