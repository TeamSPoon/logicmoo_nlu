Do you have a read on the Vikings this year?
I really dont
I know me either
I looked at their needs, and their draft but I still am a a loss.
I think they will be solid
Probably yes...I just am confused
Well no more so than with Detriot
No kidding! I just dont get that team
I think both have great potential and good players
But its like their is a curse holding them both back
They have flashes though
As long as neither team is hurt I can actually see them beating eachother up
Hopefully the excuses will stop soon about their respective pasts/records
I think so. They just have to put it together
I know their fans are ready
Their fans? Heck the entire league
That is a great rivarly
I know it...and with the Packers
Easily one of the best group of three teams
For sure.
