My son and I were talking about his favorite childhood movies.
Really, and he remembers them.
Some of them. He does remember his favorite.
What was that?
A Goofy Movie.
Do you mean Goofy as from Mickey Mouse.
Yes, but Goofy had his own movie.
I never knew that.
It was okay, but my son loved Goofy so we bought it.
That's cute.
