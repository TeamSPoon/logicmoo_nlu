How do you feel about Colin Kaepernick?
The quarterback who was always kneeling during the National Anthem? I don't know much else about him
Yeah that's him, but what do you think of him as a player?
I know he played really well with the team for a while before they started benching him
And for Blaine Gabbert of all people
Who in their right mind would think Gabbert was a better option than Colin Kaepernick?
It's hard to understand what goes through the coaches' minds when they're losing so much in a season
That's true, and I suppose I'd want to make a change too if my quarterback was throwing four interceptions in a game
But what about all those players retiring from the 49ers? That probably made a huge impact on him as a player
I think you're right, which is why I think Kaepernick gets unfairly criticized as a player
Context is everything in the NFL, although overcoming adversity is a strong skill
Sure, but there's no way that Kaepernick being overlooked by so many teams has to do with his skill as a player alone
I don't like it when the NFL gets too political, it spoils the mood for me
It's such a popular sport that you can't blame players for being outspoken
I understand that, but I wish teams would just look at Kaepernick as a player and leave his political views out of it
Well if Michael Vick can get a second chance, I suppose anyone can
That's a bit different, though; Vick broke the law and did his time, and Kaepernick just silently protested something
Yeah it's a strange double standard when you think about it
Michael Vick was an elite quarterback, and Kaepernick never was
Sure, but maybe all Kaepernick needs is a second chance to make a huge comeback!
