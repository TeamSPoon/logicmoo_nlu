That sounds great
Did you watch the voice this season?
Yes it was a great season
There was a lot of talent and the judges were awesome
I know, I hate that Alicia and Gwen are leaving. They made the show awesome.
Miley wasn't bad last time, though she did have a really diverse team.
I'm glad Chris won the whole thing
He's so talented I can't wait to see what he comes up with.
