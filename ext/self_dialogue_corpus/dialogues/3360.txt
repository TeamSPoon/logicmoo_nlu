Have you seen any new horror movies in theaters lately?
Yeah, my sister and I watched "Life" the other day. It's a Sci-Fi horror.
Oh I watched a trailer on that one. It kind of looks like an off-shoot of Alien.

Give me a quick run down of Life?
No! I will do better then that. How about I take you on Saturday after we get off work.
I would love that, as long as it does not have a lot of jump scares. I love to see Ryan Reynolds in a Sci Fi movie as well. I loved him as Dead Pool!
Oh he is a great actor, but then so is Jake Gyllenhall. You won't be disappointed. And "Life" as a few good jump scares, but you will be fine. A good horror movie is not good without a few of them to keep you on your toes.
True. Now you have me all psyched to see it. Saturday won't come soon enough.
Gives you something to look forwards too!
