Hey, what's up?
Hey buddy!  How have you been?
Pretty good.  I just got out of work.
Same.  It's been a long week.
Tell me about it.  Have any plans?
Not really.  I was going to wind down with a movie and a few beers.
I was going to do the same.
You should swing by.
Any movie suggestions?
I was thinking of rewatching the 'Lord of the Rings' movies.
That sounds great.  It's one of my favorite movie trilogies.
It was so far ahead of its time.  What was your favorite?
I loved the first one since it introduced us to the world of Middle-Earth.  It also had the best balance of all the elements; adventure, action, drama.
I really liked the first one; especially the Cave troll scene.  That said, I am a big fan of the action of 'Two Towers.'
Helm's Deep was such a great scene.  Theoden's speech was an instant classic.
It gives me chills every time.  'Lord of the Rings' is also one of the few movie franchises that stay true to the original source material.
Yea, they did justice to Tolkien's works.
True masterpieces.
Well, we should start soon if we want to get all the way through to 'Return of the King.'  Especially considering how long the last one is.
Sounds good.  See you soon.
