What type of music do you listen to?
I listen to a lot of stuff. Anywhere from dance music to death metal.
That's great. I love all styles too.
The only thing I really can't get into is country music.
I'm right there with you. I couldn't tell you five country songs.
I appreciate it for what it is, it's just not my style.
It all just sounds the same to me honestly.
I feel like you could say that about any genre of music, though.
That is true. What are you listening to lately?
That new Volume's CD is really good.
I haven't heard that one yet.
It's really new. The songs are very catchy.
What type of band are they?
They're normally a metal band but there's a lot of soft singing on this release.
So not a lot of screaming?
Way less than they had in previous releases. It's still there though.
I like some screaming but it can't be the whole song.
Yeah I think it's good for heavy music. It's hard to understand though.
I agree. I like to be able to understand the words.
You actually learn to understand it after awhile.
