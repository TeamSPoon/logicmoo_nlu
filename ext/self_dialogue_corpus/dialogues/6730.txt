Apparently the Cars franchise is continuing to do well at the box office.
Oh, yes. I heard the Cars 3 opening went really well.
I think I saw the first one. I remember Larry the Cable guy did one of the voices.
Yes. He was a tow truck called "Tow Mater".
And who was the main character in that movie?
The car was called Lightening McQueen.
His voice was also by a famous actor, wasn't it?
Yes. That was Owen Wilson, actually.
I wonder if the same characters are in this new movie.
Apparently Tow Mater, Lightning McQueen and other cars from the first two movies are in this one as well.
