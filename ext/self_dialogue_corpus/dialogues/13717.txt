Holy Moly, did you just see what "Lady Gaga" was wearing on the award show?
No, What kind of crazy thing did she wear this time?
It was an outfit made out of meat!
Are you serious?  Even her shoes?
Yes the shoes too, that is one nasty thing to wear.
I can only imagine that flies were all over her
I used to think Bjork was nuts when she wore that dress that looked like a swan but I think the meat suit wins hands down
no kidding I wonder if she was making a statement or if she is just being eclectic
Well one thing is for sure it couldn't have been for PETA
(chuckles) yeah maybe she is just stating that meat is awesome.
