Do you remember the music of the late 90s?
Somewhat. Who were some of the big groups back then?
I remember Celine Dion was really big.
Oh yeah, she had that whole Titanic moment.
Yeah, My Heart Will Go On won a Grammy back then
That song was really annoying after awhile
Yeah agree.
I remember Madonna had a big hit back then as well
Oh really, which song?
I think it was Ray of Light
Oh yeah, that was a decent song and album. I had a copy.
Sheryl Crow was hitting it big as well.
Oh Sheryl Crow. Not a super big fan of her.
Yeah, she was a little overrated in my opinion.
And then of course there were all of the boy bands.
Like New Kids?
No, I'm thinking Back Street Boys.
Oh dear. I do remember them.
Yes, how could we forget.
Yes, how could we forget. Unforgettable.
