What do you think of Rey in the star wars movies?
I like that they have a new heroine
I think natalie portman is kind of a boring actress
Yeah, those star wars movies were dreadful
The new ones are fun though
For sure. I'm sad about carrie fisher dying
yeah, at least she got to see the movies
I always wondered if mark hamill is related to dorothy hamill
He's not.
Oh well. He should be in the new star wars.
