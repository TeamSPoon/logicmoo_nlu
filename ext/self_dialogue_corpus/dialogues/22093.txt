I know, it was as good if not better than the first.
Baby Groot was adorable
I think this movie was funny as shit
Yeah, Drax was a trip.
Did you like how they did EGO
yeah, they changed it a little from the comics but it was good.
Marvel always hits a home run.
I know, Marvel is awesome.  All their movies are great.
I can't wait for Thor 3
I know, i'm excited about that
The trailers make it look real good
I love the scene where he get excited when he sees the Hulk
That made me laugh my ass off
I think it's going to be great.
Everything has been building toward The Infinity War.
That story line was some of the best comics I ever read.
The movie should be one of the best ever
I hope so.
