I was just sitting here thinking about Bobby Brown.
What about him?
How he left New Edition and crushed the game.
I know right. That Don't Be Cruel album did numbers.
He had like four or five jams on that album.
My favorite was My Prerogative.
I liked that and Roni.
The truth about Roni, she's a sweet little girl...
I know right. Then he had a few remixes.
Oh, you talking about Every Little Step.
Yeah, when he did the remix and he added a rap verse to it.
That thing was fire.
Shoot, I liked his album that had Humpin' Around on it.
Humpin' Around was my jam.
Was? Man I still be playing that jam like it just came out.
I even like the song he made with Whitney.
What was the name of that song?
We Got Something In Common.
Yeah, that's it. Damn shame she left from here.
I know right.
