There seem to be some good young teams out there that could over take both soon.
Yea, who would you say?
I'm not sure. What do you think of Philly?
Eh, they have a quarterback hopefully, but they still have a ways to go.
Yea, I agree. They have some work.
Well, maybe Tennessee is further along.
Yea, they might be. They do have a couple pieces.
I agree! Also Dallas should be ready to take the next step.
Yea, I agree. Can't count out Atlanta either. They didn't exactly get worse.
No, they didn't they should be really good again this year.
Yea, Houston seems to be hanging on as well.
I do not know how they do it.
Well, they have an amazing defense, but eventually they have to get some play makers on offense.
Yea, their defense wins games, but they need a little more offense too.
Yea, maybe a quarterback that knows how to throw would be nice.
Yea, I agree. That would be a start.
Yea, well sometimes those are harder to find than you may think.
I agree. Hopefully they will find one sooner rather than later though.
Yea, hopefully. They sure could use one.
So could about ten other teams.
