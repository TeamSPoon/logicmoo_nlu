Hey, could you teach me about football?
Sure, what do you want to know? Offense or Defense?
I'd like to learn about offense.
Ok, offense it is. I'm sure you know what the quarterback does right?
Kind of, he throws the ball right?
Well, kind of. The quarterback is basically in charge of the field. He decides the plays.
Oh ok, so he tells everybody else what to do.
Right, so he might throw the ball to someone, or he might run the ball himself or hand it off to another player. It all depends on the play.
Ok I get it. The quarterback is the general and the other players are his soldiers.
Exactly. Next we have the running back . This is usually a really fast player that can do everything. Run, block, whatever.
So, he's like a second quarterback?
Well, no, because he doesn't call the play. Remember, the quarterback decides on the play.
Oh ok, but after the play is decided, the running back is pretty important?
Yea, absolutely.
Ok, got it. What else?
Well, then we have a fullback, which is like a runningback, but normally stronger. The fullback does a lot of blocking and protecting.
Oh ok so like a buff version of the runningback.
Yea, kind of. Which is crazy because they are all so buff already.
Yea no kidding. This sounds complicated.
It's easy once you start watching games.
