What do you think the best Jamie Foxx movie is
Wow its tough hes been in a ton of good ones
He takes on alot of roles.
Yeah he goes from comedies to serious roles quickly.
Helps keep him level headed I guess.
Yeah he is a pretty down to earth guy it seems.
So what do you think is his best
He was great in Ray.
Yeah what a good portrayal.
I didnt mind him in Any Given Sunday
You cant be serious
Why not it was a good role.
Yeah but it was a generic football film.
I just think he played a great lead.
I think Pacino was the lead in that.
He was good in Horrible Bosses
Please he was barely in it
Yeah but he killed his parts!
Hes a funny guy
And can be serious when he needs to be
