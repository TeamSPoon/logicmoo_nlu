Have you heard Big Sean's new album?
The one that came out this year? Yeah.
I personally think it's his best work.
I agree. I'm surprised it doesn't get more radio play.
It seems to be like that with certain rap artists.
Yeah, they can make the best music and still get no radio play.
If the song doesn't have a hook it usually won't get played.
True, a lot of his stuff doesn't really fit the radio song structure.
Yeah, It's just a lot of clever rapping with very little singing parts.
At least no one can say he's selling out.
