Have you ever heard of the brand ripndip?
Is that with the alien and the pockets?
Yes thats the one, do you like it?
I think its okay, its a little childish to me.
I think its supposed to represent being free, not connected.
Yeah i guess, do you know of any other brands?
I think the store h&m is very good, nice clothes
Yes! i've shopped there many times and i have a lot of clothing from them
I know, its a little more mature than ripndip i think.
I agree with that. H&m is more comfortable and easier to wear.
I think you should wear h&m if you are trying to dress casually
Well i think ripndip could be worn casually as well.
Yes i agree, whats your opinion on nike?
I love nike, nike is an anytime kind of clothing.
Absolutely. I wear nike almost all the time wherever i go.
i do not wear it THAT much, but it is good.
Have you thought about buying more clothes from them?
I think about it sometimes, but its so expensive.
yeah it is pretty expensive, you should buy it from a secondary source
i will try, thank you very much
