I'm lost, I hardly ever know the names of the top bands?
Yeah, you're stuck in the 90s.  Try downloading something new.
I've been looking at the UK charts.  Mike Posner is in the top 10 now.
Top 10 for what?  Isn't he like a John Mayer type of guy?
Justin Bieber is still kicking, he has a new song in the Top 40.
Yep, it's called "sorry" and he should be.  It's terrible.
I must be getting old, most of the music I hear is terrible.
It's not just you, most of it is unlistenable unless you are a 15 year-old girl.
There is this new song by Muse out but I can't for the life of me remember the name.
If it's in the last year, it's probably called "Deep Down" or "Dig Down", something like that.
I haven't heard anything new from Kings of Leon since the Wall CD.
I haven't either, they must be partying too much.
Have you ever heard of the Imagine Dragons.
Yes, my ex-girlfriend used to play them a lot.  That's why I'm not a huge fan.
Green Day hasn't put out anything lately.  Are they over?
I don't think so, they put out something last year.  I think it was called "Still Breathing" ironically.
Did Coldplay break up or what?
I don't know.  All I've heard in the news is like gossip column stuff about who's dating who.
Hey, Wheezer has a new song out or should I say video?
If it's the one I'm thinking of, "Feels Like Summer" or something.  It wasn't bad.
