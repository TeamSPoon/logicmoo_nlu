Do you like Francis Ford Coppola movies?
I think I've seen a few - I didn't watch them intentionally because of him, though. What has he done?
'The Godfather' and 'Apocalypse Now' are probably is most famous.
'Apocalypse Now' is the Vietnam war movie, right?
Yes, based on the book 'Hearts of Darkness'.
That is an amazing movie. I've never seen the director's cut, though.
If you've seen the film anyway, I wouldn't bother. There's just an extra 20 minutes.
And that movie is already so long! 'The Godfather' is long, too.
It doesn't feel it at all. Everyone puts on incredible performances.
And the cast... Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Diane Keaton... unbelievable cast.
It would be difficult to make a bad movie with actors like that.
And Robert DeNiro is in 'The Godfather 2', but I haven't seen it.
You haven't? It's most people's favorite.
Is it your favorite?
No, the first 'Godfather' is my favorite, of the three.
That's usually the way, where the first movie is the best.
It was so faithfully adapted from the Mario Puzo novel, and I loved the book.
I haven't read it - the script is just incredible though.
Think of how many iconic lines are still around, and the movie is half a century old!
And yet it's still better than most movies they come out with today.
