You know, I didn't believe it at first, when Vader claimed to be Luke's father.
It does come a bit out of left field, doesn't it.
Exactly.  The first movie was written as if Darth and Annakin were separate characters. The revelation in Empire Strikes Back doesn't match what came before.
It does, however, match the Degobah cave scene.  It was foreshadowing.
It was weak foreshadowing, though.   Lucas really should have put in some more info about Darth and Anakin.
I think it's effective the way it is.
I don't.  I think that it's the kind of thing the audience will disbelieve.
You'd need to do a study.  All you'd need to do is find 500 people who don't know that Vader is Luke's father, and show them the movies.
I think that would be impossible.
Oh, I'm sure of it.   It's too well know. You could try, though.
