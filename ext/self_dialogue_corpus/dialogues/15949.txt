Hey, have you heard the new country station?
No, what type of songs do they play?
It's mostly new country hits, like Blake Shelton, Jason Aldean, stuff like that.
Oh wow, that sounds pretty good!  I love Blake Shelton.
Yeah I especially like his videos, too.
He just has a great voice overall, and his lyrics are always so catchy.
I know!  I can't help but like the older country hits, too, though.
Well yeah, Patsy Cline is hard to beat.
Yes, there aren't a lot of radio stations that play the old classic country.
I know, it seems like it's not as popular as you would think.  A lot of people overlook it.
Yes, and a lot of the newer country sounds more like rock music to me.
Seriously!  What about Dierks Bentley?
Yeah, he sounds like a rock musician.  I do like some of his tunes though.
Yeah but I think the classic country artists would be insulted!
What, that they're calling that music country?
Exactly!  It sounds like rock.
True.  Well, things always change over time.
Yes, but country music should still be preserved with its integrity as country.
Yes, I do agree.  That's why the classic country stations are great.
Yeah, they don't play that type of new rock country nonsense.
