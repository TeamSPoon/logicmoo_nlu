I read yesterday was the 50th anniversay of the Beatle's song "All You Need Is Love."
Wow, that was a long time ago. It makes you realize how fast time flies.
"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band" is also having a 50th anniversary.
I think even more people relate to that because it was in a movie in the 70s.
Oh yes, I remember that. The Gibb brothers were awesome.
I think they are great singers, and I liked this better than their disco.
The disco was kind of funny, but I liked this movie because of this really great song, Strawberry Fields Forever.
That song gave me chills when they sang it.
I know, I think I had a few tears during that.
It's no wonder people still like the Beatle's music after 50 years.
