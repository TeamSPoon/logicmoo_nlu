Do you want to watch a French movie?
I don't know. I don't really like reading subtitles.
My favorite movie ever was a French movie.
Really? What was it called?
It's A Christmas Tale. It's a really weird story.
Tell me about it.
This dysfunctional family meets up for Christmas and a lot of weird stuff happens.
I don't know if that's my type of thing.
Trust me, it was amazing. I really identified with the characters.
I prefer action movies.
Really? I wouldn't have guessed that about you.
Yeah, I'm really into the Lethal Weapon movies from the 80s.
I've never seen those.
They're kind of buddy cop movies. There are lots of explosions.
I guess I'm just not that into explosions.
But it's fun! Especially on a big screen.
I'm glad someone likes it.
Hey, you liked The Dark Knight. That has explosions!
You're right. Maybe I do like explosions.
Explosions are the best.
