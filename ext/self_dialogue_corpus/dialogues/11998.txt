I just saw Attack of the Clones again.
Did you like that one?
It wasn't too bad.  Loved Padm√© Amidala.
Yea, Natalie Portman rocks.
I wasn't too thrilled with Jar Jar Binks.
Yes, i think he was over the top.
I liked the battle, though.
Me too.  What else did you like?
I like the marriage at the end of the movie.
It was silly having robots as witnesses.
