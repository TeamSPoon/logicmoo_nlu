Did you watch the newest Kevin Hart special yet?
Yes, it was awesome!
What was your favorite part of it?
I loved the jokes about the raccoons, I was laughing so hard!
Yeah, that part was really great.  I think my favorite was when he talked about his kids!
That was pretty great!
I can't wait until he stars in a new movie!
Yeah, his movies are always super fun.
Definitely, we should plan to go to the movies next time he comes out with one!
Most definitely.
What's your favorite movie that he's done?
I think I'd have to say Get Hard, that one was really funny, especially with Will Ferrell.
They were great working together.  But I think my favorite Kevin Hart movie would be the Wedding Ringer.
Oh yeah, I remember watching that one.
Remember? We saw it at your house and had popcorn!
I was laughing so hard when he was acting with Josh Gad!
It was absolutely hilarious!
Yeah it was! All this movie talk has me in the mood to watch one!
Let's go watch one then!
Sounds great, let's go!
