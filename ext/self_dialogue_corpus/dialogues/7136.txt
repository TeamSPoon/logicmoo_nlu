Hey, I was wondering if you've seen the new Beauty and the Beast movie yet?
No! I've been meaning to check it out, but the timing hasn't been right. Have you?
Yes! It was amazing and beautiful. I couldn't believe how much better it was than the original.
What was so different about it? I haven't even seen any ads for it, to be honest.
The Beast actually sings in this one. And the graphics are incredible!
I'm going to have to go see it in the theaters then, before they stop playing it.
I hope you do! It would be a shame not to.
It sounds like it. I did hear that Emma Watson made the perfect Beauty for the film.
She and Dan Stevens, Luke Evans, Kevin Kline all did spectacular work on the film.
Ok, you've convinced me! I will see it this weekend, and if they're lucky, maybe I'll take the kids!
