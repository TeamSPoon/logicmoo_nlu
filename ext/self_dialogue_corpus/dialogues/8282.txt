Do you really think Michael Jackson was the king of pop?
I suppose I do
What about Prince?
Yeah. I actually like Purple Rain better than Thriller.
What about Janet Jackson?
That velvet rope album turned me out.
I think Beiber is pretty great
I need you to stop talking. he's terrible.
What about Bruno Mars?
He's great of course.
