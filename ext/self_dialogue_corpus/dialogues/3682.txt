Have you ever seen Curve?
No, what's that about?
It's a movie about a woman who gives a hitchhiker a ride and ends up driving off a cliff.
Why did she do that?
Well, he took out a knife and she started freaking out, so she figured, I'll either get raped or I'll drive off this cliff.
Oh, and she chose the cliff.
Yep, and then she gets stuck in her car for days at the bottom of the cliff.
Wow, does she die.
No, she is quite the warrior in the movie. She gets out and gets revenge.
Very cool.
