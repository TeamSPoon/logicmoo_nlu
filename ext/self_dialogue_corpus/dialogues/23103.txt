What's your favorite Marvel movie?
My favorite so far is Civil War.
That's a good one but not my favorite.
No? Which one then?
I liked the first Avengers the best.
I did until Civil War came out.
What's so great about it?
Just about everything. There were so many heroes in that one.
But there was no Hulk or Thor.
True. But they had everyone else except Doctor Strange and those two.
I still think Avengers was better.
Well what was so awesome about avengers compared to Civil War?
One word. Hulk.
What about him?
Well it was the first movie with the new actor and he was awesome.
That's it? He was good but it didn't make the movie.
To me it did. Especially the scene where he grabbed Loki and whipped him around like a ragdoll.
I'd rather watch all the rest battle each other any day.
We'll just agree to disagree.
I'll agree you're opinion is wrong.
