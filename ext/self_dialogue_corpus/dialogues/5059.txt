Did you hear that Derek Jeter is getting his number retired?
No I didn't. When will that happen?
Sunday night, before the game on ESPN.
That's the Yankees game, right?
Of course! Who else did he play for?
Nobody else that I know of.
That's right. Just the guys in the pinstripes
Didn't he play shortstop?
Yeah. And he won five gold gloves!
He was an all-star also, wasn't he?
Not only that, but he's a future hall-of-famer without a doubt.
This guy must have been the best Yankee to ever play.
Well, he is one of the best. The Yankees have a long list of all-time great players.
Like Babe Ruth, Joe DiMaggio, MIickey Mantle, and Yogi Berra?
Yeah! But none of those guys got more hits than Jeter. He's the all time hits leader for the Yankees.
Wow! That's saying a lot! What about all of major league baseball?
He is sixth all time with 3,465 hits.
Oh my! Did he get more hits than Hank Aaron?
Actually, no. Aaron got 3,771 hits, which is third-most all time.
That's no suprise to me. Hank Aaron hit so many home runs in his career.
