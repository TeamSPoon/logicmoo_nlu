Are you a fan of Rob Zombies movies?
Yes, I am. He's got a sick mind.
That's funny, but yes he does.
Very creative and his characters in the movies are very colorful.
The only movie I didn't like was that one called The Lords of Salem.
I didn't see that one.
Well don't bother. Not very good.
That's weird. Who was in it?
Well of course his wife Sheri was the star.
Another creepy movie.
It was supposed to be, but I didn't really find anything very good about it.
Is that a recent movie?
It came out in 2012.
I really never heard of that.
We bought the DVD because we like his work, but then sold it on Ebay.
So it was that bad?
Yes, we wasted and hour and forty minutes watching it.
Well why did you keep watching it?
When I start one, I have to finish it. I always hope for something good to happen.
Me too.
