Is Paul Thomas Anderson overrated?
He's made good movies.
I like a few of them, but some are bad.
Like which?
That one with Adam Sandler.
Punch Drunk Love? I liked it.
Eh. And The Master was terrible.
I didn't see it.
It's garbage.
Boogie Nights and There Will Be Blood are great.
They're good, but not great.
Are you kidding? They are beautifully written and shot.
He does hire good cinematographers.
Magnolia is another good one.
Yes, I liked that one too.
So you seem to like most of his movies.
Yes, and I'll probably watch his next one.
So maybe you're underrating him.
You're probably right. He's talented.
That wasn't hard to admit, was it?
