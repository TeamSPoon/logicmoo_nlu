What is your favorite Michael Keaton role?
That's a tough call-- I love him in Batman, Beetlejuice, Birdman-- I'm super excited to see him in Spider-man: Homecoming.
Yeah, that looks like it'll be really good-- it's cool to see him in another superhero movie.
Did you know they were going to make a second Beetlejuice?
Really?!
Yeah, the premise was the Deets family buys a hotel on a Hawaiian island, and Beetlejuice is supposed to scare them away.
That is the dumbest idea I've ever heard.  I'm glad they passed.
Speaking of movies that almost happened-- have you ever heard of a movie called Superman Lives?
Yeah, they made a documentary about the movie falling through.  It's really interesting--  I would've seen it.
They make the producer sound like a mad man-- making a lot of stupid suggestions.
Yeah, like Superman had to fight a giant spider.
And, how the giant spider made it into Wild Wild West, with Will Smith.
I never saw that movie, fortunately.
Really?  It's Will Smith's best role, if you exclude all his other roles.
I liked him in Independence Day.
That's a great movie-- too bad he wasn't back for the sequel.
I haven't seen that-- I thought they kinda said all they needed to with the first one.
I'd watch it if it came on Netflix or something.
There are too many good movies out there to waste your time.
I like watching bad movies every now and then-- it makes me really appreciate the good ones.
