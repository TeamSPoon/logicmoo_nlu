Do you like the Beatles?
Yes, I do.
What is your favorite Beatles song?
It is difficult to say as they have so many good songs.
If you had to pick just one, which one would it be?
"Hey, Jude" is one of my favorites.
That was their first release on their own Apple Records label!
Paul McCartney wrote it to comfort John Lennon's son, Julian, when his parents were getting a divorce.
I really like "When I'm Sixty-Four".
Paul McCartney composed that one when he was about 15 years old!
Wow, he wrote that when he was young!
Yes, then he brought it out when his father turned 64.
Another one of my favorites is "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds".
John Lennon says he wrote it based on a picture his son had brought home from school.
Yes, a picture of a classmate of Julian's,
Her name was Lucy O'Donnell and she didn't know the song was about her until 1976.
Didn't people say it was based drugs because of the initials of the song being LSD?
Yes, but Lennon says it wasn't.
Didn't he have another explanation later on?
Yes, he later said that it was inspired by "Alice in Wonderland".
