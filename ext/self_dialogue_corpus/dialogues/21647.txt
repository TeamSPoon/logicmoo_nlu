I just re-watched Django Unchained what do you think about that movie?
I've heard so much about it, but I've never had a chance to see it!
Are you serious, it is one of my favorite movies.
What stands out to you about it?
Lots of things, I can't give it away, but it's a truly original movie with action and great writing.
I need to watch it then, who directed it again?
Quentin Tarantino, he's sincerely a great director.
Oh then I definitely need to watch Django, I love all of Tarantino's movies. I know Jaime Foxx is starring, but who else?
Yes Jaime Foxx is in it. Christoph Waltz and Leonardo DiCaprio also have big roles.
Leonardo DiCaprio is always in such important movies, Inception was an incredible work.
I loved Inception! I still feel like that I haven't figured out what exactly happens even though I've watched it so many times.
I know, it is one of those movies you have to watch a couple times to really grasp what the meaning is.
I think I prefer movies that aren't too thought provoking, but still engaging if you understand.
Hm really? No I really like movies that make me think about what's being portrayed.
I guess sometimes, I really just hate space movies though.
What! I love space and movies about it. Why do you hate it?
I don't know, I think I saw a space movie when I was young and it scared me, so now I avoid it.
I think you would enjoy them now, have you seen Interstellar?
No, I haven't, but I have heard some great things about it.
We will watch it together, I promise it won't be scary.
