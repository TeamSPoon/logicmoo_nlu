I hope the NFL doesnt make anymore rule changes or new ones.
Me either, it's gotten silly lately.
If it gets any worse it will be like Flag Football.
I thought it was silly that players cant do a shimmy after a touchdown.
Or slam the ball.
Yeah, it's getting crazy.
Between that and the concussions.
Yeah, the no helmets clicking rule.
You cant always control that, it's silly.
Serious, any play can have helmet contact.
It's too bad we can petition the comittee for rule changes.
Yeah, but the rules now are "for the better"
They are doing the same with Boxing,
Next you will have to wear a helmet for golfing.
Or safety gear for Bowling.
I fear it will only get worse.
I guess time will tell.
Yeah.
I do like your idea about petitioning the NFL Comittee.
I wonder how we go about doing that.
