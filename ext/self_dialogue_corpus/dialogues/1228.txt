I think that football games in the NFL are way too long, don't you think?
Yeah, definitely. I think it's due to all the time outs and commercials.
That's what it is. There is just way too much commercials.
Well, that's how the NFL make their money. So I'm not surprised.
I'm just surprised that a game that is supposed to be an hour is now taking almost four hours to watch. That is ridiculous.
Yeah, and it's even worse when you live in the East Coast.
Exactly. I think the NFL has gotten too greedy with trying to squeeze in as much ad time as they can.
Yeah. But I don't see them changing it anytime soon.
I actually think that fans have started to revolt against it. With the internet, more and more people are watching games by other means.
That's what I heard. Wasn't footbball ratings down last season?
Yeah it was. And I think part of it was the fact that a lot of people are just tired of all the commercials.
Probably. But do you actually see the NFL cutting down on commercials?
They're gonna have to unless they want people to stop tuning in.
If that's the case, then the NFL is going to have to figure out how to make money with less commercials.
One of the things I heard was that they were considering putting sponsors on team jerseys.
You mean like company logos on the team uniforms?
Yeah. I think that's one way they can make money with less commercials.
I would actually be for that if it meant shorter NFL games with less commercials.
I would too. But it's going to be odd buying a jersey with a logo from a corporation on it.
If it means I can go to bed at a reasonable time because I don't have to watch a four hour game, then it's fine with me.
