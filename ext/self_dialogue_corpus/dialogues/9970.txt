I just watched the movie Collide the other night.
That's the one with Nicholas Hoult and Felicity Jones right?
Yeah I've become a huge fan of Nicholas since his role as the War Boy in Mad Max Fury Road. I'm also a huge fan of Felicity Jones since Like Crazy and recently Rogue One.
Is this an action movie or a romance?
It's starts as a romance but it's a pure action movie. I was surprised when I found out Ben Kingsley and Anthony Hopkins were also in this!
Wait, I didn't know Ben Kingsley and Anthony Hopkins were in this!
Ben Kingsley is hilarious in his role. He plays a slimy criminal that makes Nicholas run errands for him. He's basically playing a character very similar to his role in Iron Man 3 as the Mandarin.
I've always seen Ben Kingsley as a serious actor but when I watched Ironman 3 that was so surprising in a good way to see that he could really ham it up.
He really hams it up in Collide. The movie overall was very average, the action was good, the romance bare, and the story plot pretty basic. I would consider this movie a pretty generic action flick.
This sounds like one of those rainy Sunday afternoon movies to throw on. I think I'll save it for that occasion.
