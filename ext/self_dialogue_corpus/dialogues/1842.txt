What's up? Are you ready for the football season?
I can't wait. We just got a new projection T.V. and green wall for watching NFL games.
Great! Who do you think will go all the way this year?
If I had to bet on it today I would say the Patriots.
It's hard to deny their talent but I am not a fan.
Understood. That whole Aaron Hernandez fiasco left a bad taste in my mouth.
They knew who he was and what he was capable of before they drafted him!
He had enough off the field problems to scare most teams away. Pats are all about winning.
Speaking of tight ends, I like Greg Olsen from the Panthers.
Olsen is cool and I think that Travis Kelce is going to have a big year.
What about Gronk? He's on top right now.
He's great when he's playing but I think he's injury prone.
If he stay off of the bench and on the field he'll be unstoppable this year.
Same with Jordan Reed from the Skins. he's got mad skills.
Yup. He missed four games last year.
Do you think that Matt Ryan still has what it takes to win a ring?
Absolutely! I have been a Ryan fan since he was with Boston College.
He's a tough guy, this year will depend on his offensive line.
I believe the O line is the key ingredient for any team's offense.
Yes it is and that is why the Patriots always dominate.
