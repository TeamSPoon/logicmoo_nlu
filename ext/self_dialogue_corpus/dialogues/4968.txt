Have you been following the New York Yankees this season?
Yes.  I wouldn't say they are my favorite team, but they are hard not to hear about.
I know what you are saying.  They are pretty much the most famous team in baseball.
I am impressed by the way that franchise has been turned around.
Exactly!  I mean it wasn't even that long ago they won their last World Series.
Yes, it seems like they rebuilt that team without truly rebuilding.
I agree.  They had some bad seasons, but they didn't seem to have a sustained span of being horrible.
It feels like Rivera, Jeter, and Rodriguez just left.  And they are right back to being contenders.
Yes, they remind me of the Cubs, with all that young talent.
Yes.  Aaron Judge is just an amazing player.
I know.  I cannot get over the size of that guy.
He has the height of a basketball player and the size of a football player.
It's amazing he's playing baseball, and even more amazing how good he is so far.
Yes.  And this is after Gary Sanchez and his awesome rookie season.
I mean the bottom line is, the Yankees are always going to be competitive.
Yes.  That history, and they have a lot of money to spend.
Let's not also forget that the team does seem well managed.
Yes, I don't think the Yankees get enough credit for the smart front office decisions they do make.
Agreed.  People think it's all about spending money, but you have to make smart decisions with that money.
Yes, I think the Yankees are a well-run club.  We'll see if this is already their year again.
