You know what movie was actually really good?
Which one do you mean?
I'm trying to think of the name of it but it has Ben Affleck in it.
Do you mean Batman Vs. Superman?
No no, not a super hero movie.
Was it The Accountant?
Yes that movie! Have you seen it?
I have. I thought it was so intriguing.
It was amazing, very well written movie.
That guy sure knew his numbers, probably better than he did people. It was great.
