Did you ever watch Deepwater Horizon?
I believe so. Remind me, who's in that one?
Mark Wahlberg and Kurt Russell
Oh I love Kurt Russell. Especially in Escape from LA.
Ummm, yeah that's a random movie.
Well it's one of his finest.
Anyway, Deepwater Horizon is about the oil rig explosion from a few years ago.
Oh yeah, and then there was that leak that went on for months.
Yes, well this is the story behind that explosion.
Oh so almost like a docu-drama.
Yes, it makes BP look like a very evil company that didn't care about safety.
Interesting. Who directed it?
Peter Berg
Oh man I love his work. I loved Friday Night Lights.
Yeah, that was a good one. Battleship not so much.
Oh dear, that was horrible.
Yeah, probably one of those regret movies.
Oh yeah. I'm sure most directors have a few of those.
Anyway, definitely check out Deepwater Horizon. A good movie overall.
Okay I will. Thanks.
