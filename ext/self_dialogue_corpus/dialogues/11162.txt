Did you see any of the fashion at the met ball this year ?
Yes I seen a lot of it. It was less wild for the most part than last year.
You think so ? I though Rihanna's dress was insane!
I liked it ! It was wild but nothing last last years fashions.
I thought it was very ugly and silly.
It was a statement. Did you see Kylie Jenners dress?
Yes it was beautiful. But a copy of Beyonc√© dress last year.
You think so ? I thought I stood out. Did you catch Sendyayas dress?
The yellow one ? It was stunning. Reminded me of a Chanel.
I love Chanel. Do you prefer Chanel to Michael Khors fashion ?
Of course. But Alexander McQueen is better.
I don't think so. But I do like the way he mixes patterns on his clothes.
I see a dress of his at a show. Back out. Long and flowly. It was so pretty.
I didn't see that. Don't you think backless is a little out of date ?
I a lot of stuff is coming back in style. Like the Olsen twins style at the met gala. Did you see it ?
I did. I didn't like.  Made me think they were the worst dressed.
I think solange Knowles was worst dressed. It was a sleeping bag. Black and silly
I may agree with you. Who do you think was best ?
I think Zendyaa. Her yellow flowing dress and her overall style was amazing.
I disagree. I give it to Nikki minage. Understand and simple. But elegant.
