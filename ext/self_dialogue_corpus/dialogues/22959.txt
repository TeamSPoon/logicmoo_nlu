Do you ever like spoof movies?
What exactly are spoof movies?
They are movies where they are basically making fun of other movies?
Oh right I knew that.
Do you like them at all?
Not really. I think they're kind of stupid.
Sometimes they can be funny.
Yes sometimes. But have you seen "Fifty Shades of Black"?
Actually I have but only part of it. Got tired of watching it.
I really like Marlon Wayans but just didn't care for that spoof.
I didn't either. It was so dumb it wasn't really funny.
I completely agree.
I loved the original "Fifty Shades of Grey" movies though.
Oh me too. They were pretty raunchy but amazing.
I can't wait for the last in the trilogy to come out next year.
Me either.
What did you think of the actor who played Christian?
He was pretty hot actually.
I agree. Not bad to look at at all.
It will be interesting to see how they conclude with the next movie.
