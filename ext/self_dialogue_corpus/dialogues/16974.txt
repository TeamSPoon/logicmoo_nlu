Ever heard of Trance music?
No, what is it?
It's like Techno but slower.
Oh yeah, I've heard of that. I don't like it much though.
Well it's a lot different. You should listen to some of it sometime.
Ok, cool. Anyone you recommend?
Yes. I recommend checking out Temple One and Adam Nickey.
It must be bigger in Europe than the US I guess?
Yeah it's massive over in Europe.
I can imagine. A big nightclub scene and raves?
Definitely! People like to party a lot.
Not like here though?
No, as in go out and dance in clubs.
Yeah, here when people party they go over a friends house or something.
Yup, it's totally different. I was in Russia once and they also dig their Trance music.
Man, over here when you see cars go by you can hear rock, country and many other genres. I bet it's different in Russia?
You can hear it coming out of the cars. Trance that is and other electronic music. It's actually refreshing.
I think I'll plan a trip to Europe sometime just to see how different the music scene is.
You really should. You won't regret it.
I'm sure it'll be awesome!
