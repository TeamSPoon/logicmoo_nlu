how long have you been a fan of Lady Gaga?
Oh since she first came out years ago, I heard her music in Montreal before the states.
Oh really? What's your favorite song?
My favorite is still Just Dance,  nothing like the original. You?
Actually I agree about the original CD but I prefer Poker Face.
Do you think she is still as popular?
I wish! I think once she did the Tony Bennett duo things went downhill!
oh I totally agree, I feel like Katy Perry did a nice job taking over
Totally agree, I loved Gagas outfits at every show but she hasn't really done that, what u think?
She is still my favorite and I can't wait for her new CD this year!
