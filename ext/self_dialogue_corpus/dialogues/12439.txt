Did you like the movie"Revenge of the Sith", when Darth Vader fought Yoda?
Yes, I saw that episode, Yoda kick his but.
The Darth Sidious was trying to fight Yoda because he thought he could beat him, but he was wrong.
Yeah, Darth Sideous is no match for Yoda.
Did you like the episode in Star Wars III when Obi- Wan VS General Grievous?
Yeah! that was cool.
Obi-Wan beat his butt.
I could not believe when Anakin Skywalker fought Obi-Wan, shocking.
I have to see the movie again I forgot what happened to Obi-Wan.
I will be going to see "Stars Wars 8" as soon as it comes out.
