What is the name of Lady Gaga's last album?
It is Joanne, it was her fifth studio album.
That's right. I just recall she has pink hat on the cover.
Yes, I love that hat. What track on it do you like most?
Million Reasons, it is so moving and emotional.
I think that is my favorite single from this album as well.
The lyrics slightly reminded me of that old tracy chapman song, Give me one reason to stay here.
That is a similar message.
I wonder if she realized the similarity or is totally unaware?
Who knows it could be a subconscious thing. Artist constantly influence each other.
