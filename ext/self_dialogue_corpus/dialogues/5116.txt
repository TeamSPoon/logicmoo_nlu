Do you like the San Diego Padres?
Well, I'm not so sure about them.
They have a pretty young team this year.
Yes, that is why they won't do very well this season.
At least the Padres aren't in last place!
Yes, but being second to last place isn't something to be proud of.
But they do have some guys that have been banging out some homeruns.
That just isn't enough to be in the running for a playoff game anytime soon.
Now that the Chargers moved to LA who else do we have to root for?
That's a good point!
And you must admit attending a Padre's game is far more affordable than going to a Football game
Oh yes, and it is really cool how the Padres give awesome discounts to Veterans.
Are you a Veteran?
Oh yes, my family couldn't afford to attend so many Padre's games otherwise.
What do you think about the pitching line-up?
It really seems pretty hit and miss right now.
Would you agree the moral of the team is very positive this year?
Yes, the guys really seem to be developing a positive, can-do attitude as a team?
I for one plan to support our Padres, win or lose!
Me too, it's not cool to be a fair weather fan.
