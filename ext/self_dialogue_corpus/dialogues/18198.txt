Do you ever listen to Patsy Cline?
Yeah, I love her sound.  She has such a beautiful voice.
Yeah she does.  Her music is truly classic.
Yeah, she was considered country and pop, did you know that?
Oh wow, kinda like Tim McGraw I guess.
Yeah you could say that.  I believe she rose to fame in the fifties and sixties.
What are your favorite songs of hers?
Oh gosh.  I love them all, but I guess Crazy is my favorite.
Yeah, that's definitely one of her best.
She and Kitty Wells probably contributed a lot to the role of women in country music.
Yeah for sure they did!
Did you know that Willie Nelson actually wrote Crazy?
Oh no, I didn't know that.  He was great, too.
Yeah.  Also did you know she died in a plane crash?
No I had no idea.
Yeah, she was only thirty.
Walkin After Midnight is another incredible song of hers.
Yeah, that one is beautiful.  I think she's a legend.
Yeah, and I heard she was an inspiration to Reba McIntyre and LeAnn Rhymes.
I would't be surprised.
