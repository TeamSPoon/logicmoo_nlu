Have you heard of the Korean boy band Big Bang?
Yes, I am a fan of them! Especially Taeyang. He is so talented.
I liked Taeyang too! They have been in the world news lately though.
What happened? I haven't been updated on anything!
Well firstly, TOP was taken to the hospital for what is suspected as drug overdose.
That is crazy. I hope he is okay!
There is still no word on him yet, but just yesterday G-Dragon was seen looking very sickly and extremely skinny.
Wow! The stardom must be getting to them.
Exactly.  A lot of these pop singers are under immense pressure in the spotlight.
I really hope that they get it together though, they are amazing.
What about Miley Cyrus' comeback?
I know! She made like a huge change in her life. Extremely proud of her.
Me too.  Her new song 'Malibu' also has a summer tone to it.
I agree.  She's definitely moving along.
'Malibu' is so different from her previous songs though.
Right, it's very country.  She's going back to her roots all right.
Have you seen the top 100 Billboard charts though! Guess who's number one!
I have not.  Who is it??
Our boy, Justin Bieber with 'Despacito.'
All right! I'm so proud of him.
