Do you really think Yoko Ono was the reason for the breakup of the Beatles?
No.  I think they had reached the end of the string.
I really enjoy Lovely Rita Meter Maid.
That's a lesser known song for them.  I like All My Loving.
Wh do you think will be the last Beatle?
I think it will be Ringo.  He still looks pretty good.
I believe it will be Paul.  He's ageless.
We'll just have to wait and see.
How many people can you name from the Sgt. Pepper album cover?
Not very many, although there are a lot of them pictured.
