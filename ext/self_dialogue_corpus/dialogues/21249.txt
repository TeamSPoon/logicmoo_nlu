Have you seen the new Star Wars?
No is it any good? I heard that had some classic characters that where CG
It was good and yes it's the one with the fake actors.
Who was in that movie?
I think it had Harrison Ford and some of the other classic cast
Yep, that sounds right. That scene where they were in massive pearl was distressing.
Did you see it in 3D
No I don't like 3d movies, they give me a headache.
I saw it in IMAX and was really blown away by the price.
Did you get popcorn at the theatre?
What do you think I am a millionare? I brought my own popcorn in my pockets. Those theaters are a rip off.
I agree, is it wrong that  I don't think the price is worth it.
Well that is sort of the case isn't it.
I didn't really understand the plot, It was set at an odd time.
I liked how they ended it at the begining of the first one.
Well that is truly a strange way to write a movie
I fond it to be a thriller though. It did have good reviews
The reviews are the reason I went to see it.
Well if it wasn't for the thearter prices I would have seen it.
Well will you see the next one?
