The Spice Girls were my favorite pop group.
Mine too. I love so many of their songs.
My favorite is Too Much.
I love that song, but my most favorite is Wannabe.
I think that song is what they're most famous for.
Yeah, you're right. I think even my dad knows that song.
Haha. My dad always teases me about the music I used to listen to
Mine too. He is always bringing up 'Nsync and The Backstreet Boys.
That's so funny. I used to play 'Nsync's song Bye Bye Bye over and over.
Me too. Everytime I hear it, it takes me back to my younger days.
