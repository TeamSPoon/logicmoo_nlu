what do you think of today's music?
You mean like what's on the radio?
Yeah
I think the radio is old news. Too many commercials and way too much repetition of the same music
Yeah, i prefer the streaming services like Spotify
Yeah, me too, though i use Pandora myself. You can tailor it more to your taste.
And avoid the repetitiveness you mentioned
Exactly
What kind of 'stations' do you have on Pandora?
Hmmm, let's see...i have Sean Lennon Radio, Don McLean radio, The Finches radio to name a few
Cool, I like some of those artists too. I love the Finches
Yeah, they're the bomb
What about you? What artist stations or lists do you have?
Hmm, I've got everything from Dvorak to Dylan
Ha, a man of many tastes i see!
Yes, definitely.
i get that. Music is the universal language; the more flavors the better!
Yes, i mean who would choose to eat the same food over and over when there are so many available?
I couldn't agree more.
Cheers to music!
