is it me or it's true that top pop singers are all females?
Now that you mentioned, I do think it's kinda true
yea, you see, we have Lorde, Anitta, Miley Cyrus, Katy Perry,etc. all females
maybe it has something to do with the genre, let's say it's a feminine genre
but there are few exceptions though, like we also have Ed Sheeran and imagine dragons,etc.
yea, they are the exceptions, but I still feel their songs are kinda feminine
interesting obervation, but anyway, do you have a favorite pop singer?
If I have to choose, it's katy perry
Why?
she's never giving me visual fatique, both visually and vocally
