So, who do you think is the King of Rock and Roll?
That's easy Elvis Presley.
Some people think it is Chuck Berry.
Well, some people think it is Little Richard too but if you want my opinion it was Elvis.
Why do you think Elvis? He is not the first to be associated with rock and roll.
The looks, the hair, the moves, the sneer and not to mention the voice.
But, Chuck Berry had the best moves and a great voice.
Well, if we are going there Little Richard had some great hair and pretty cool moves.
Okay, of the three pick one of their songs that is really rock and roll.
How about Elvis's "Jailhouse Rock", it even has the word rock in it.
I thought you was going to say "All Shook Up", how about Little Richard.
It's gotta be "Slipin and Slidin" for Little Richard.
I like that one so how about Chuck Berry? What song would you pick for him?
I am going to say "Johnnie B, Goode".
I like that one but I also like "Maybellene" or maybe "Sweet Little Sixteen".
I think it really depends on which singer you like the best.
I like Elvis and Little Richard but Chuck is definitely the king.
I like all three of them too, but I think it is a matter of opinion and I pick Elvis.
Well, I guess we are going to have to agree to disagree.
I agree, to each his own.
