What are your top 5 favorite movies?
The entire Rocky series, because that can count as one for me, Roger Dodger, Almost Famous, Big Lebowski, and Zodiac.
Wow, Zodiac huh?
Yeah, it's a great movie-- I could watch it on repeat.  The cast is excellent, and there is a lot of attention to detail.
Yeah, Mark Ruffalo and Robert Downey Jr working years before Avengers.
Have you seen the director's cut of Almost Famous?
Yeah, it's almost 3 hours, but it doesn't feel that long.
A lot of the additional content is very subtle, but I think it adds a lot.
Did you know that there's a yearly festival celebrating the Big Lebowski?
Yeah-- Lebowskifest.  I'd love to go-- I could quote that movie endlessly.
Are you a big Coen Brothers fan?
I like all of their movies, but I only really love a few of them, like Lebowski, and Raising Arizona.
Nicholas Cage in his best role, in my opinion.
You didn't like his turn in the Wicker Man?
Haha, nah.  I didn't really like the original Wicker Man either.  I thought it was too slow and dull.
What is your favorite remake?
I really like Rob Zombie's Halloween.  I honestly thought the originals were kinda drab, especially in comparison.
How about that remake of Psycho?  It was basically a shot for shot recreation.
Yeah, that was a movie that probably didn't need to be made.
Agreed.
