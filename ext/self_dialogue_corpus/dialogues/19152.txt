What is your favorite song by Metallica?
I like "One".
Really? I would have thought you would have said the unforgiven.
I like that one off their black album, but for their older work, I like One the best.
Why is that?
Have you seen the video?
No, can't say as I have.
It is about a solider that is wounded; he lost his legs, arms and sight. He can't even talk.
That is awful !
It is really. As the doctors are standing over him, wondering aloud how he is even alive he hears how bad he is and starts to lose it.
Well who won't?
So what did he do?
The only thing he could really, he kept blinking trying to signal them.
Did it work?
In the lyrics, we hear his internal monologue about trying to hold his breath inside and pray for death.
wow, thats some powerful stuff.
After a really long guitar solo, the lyrics say that another docotr comes in to have a look and tells them it is not a eye spasm, but Morse code.
What was he trying to say?
Kill me, please kill me... over and over.
I just got chills, but it makes you listen to the song in a whole new light.
