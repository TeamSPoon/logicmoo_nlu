Have you seen any of the Oscar Winners?
I don't know if it won anything, but I saw Arrival last week.
Oh yeah, I think it won Sound Editing!
Huh, that makes sense. It certainly had some interesting sounds.
Yeah, I've seen it. What did you think of it?
It was definitely my kind of movie, I love hard sci-fi.
I thought the twist came out of nowhere.
Really? I thought it was super obvious.
I thought it was just kinda random and seemed too far fetched to me.
I don't know, there were aliens, and there was an entire monologue about time at the beginning that telegraphed it pretty obviously in my opinion.
I guess, but it just seemed like too much to swallow that understanding a language could affect how we view time.
I mean it is the entire premise of the film, and again, aliens.
Human languages don't work like that, though.
I mean to a certain extent the way you speak affects perception; for example some languages don't assign personal blame the same way we do.
Really? Are there other examples?
Sure! Some languages don't have different words for blue and green, so they consider it the same color.
Wow, I'd never thought about it that way.
Yeah, language is cool. I thought the way Arrival was filmed really captured that and was excellently made.
You've made me rethink my position. Maybe I'll have to watch it again.
If you do, I'll watch it with you! I always learn something new when I rewatch good movies.
