Have you been keeping up with the games lately?
To some extent. You?
Yeah. I try to. I can't say for sure how the Rangers will do.
The Rangers! I remember their team from the early '90s, even.
Yeah? Rafael Palmeiro?
Sure. I don't recall them all.
They weren't bad. They're doing really well lately.
It helps to finally make a world series.
Yeah. That was one hell of a dry spell, wasn't it?
At least. People joke about Boston, but sheesh!
They have some quirky characters on their roster lately.
The one guy from Bolivia(I think) qualifies.
Sure. How many baseball players have huge pirate-style beards?
He's the only one coming to mind right now.
In all seriousness, though, maybe they'll have another chance soonish.
Maybe. I do like that they get by without a Steinbrenner type running the show.
How so? What about him do you mean?
I mean their success doesn't seem entirely dictated on who can afford the best players.
Simply because their owner's rich, right?
Exactly. That gets tiring.
