It's interesting how iconic a song can be, if heard in the right context; you always think back to the first time you heard it.
Oh, I know what you mean. I first heard Tainted Love on an episode of Dr. Who and now every time I hear that song I think back to that episode.
Isn't that by Soft Cell?
I think so . . . but anyways that song reminds me more of Dr. Who than the actual lyrics and meanings.
That's how it is for me too, with Places I Remember.
What movie - or book - did you hear it in?
It was in a Lassie movie. It really resonated with me because I experienced the same feelings in the songs.
Do you know who it's by?
Yeah, the Beatles! I didn't realize it until later, though.
Speaking of books, there was a song I read about, that I had made up a tune for in my head.
Wait, an actual song?
Yeah, it was. I heard it on the radio and suddenly the scenes it was in made a whole lot more sense.
What song was it?
It was Handsome Polly O; the books I read it in was the Tillerman Cycle by Cynthia Voigt.
That song sounds interesting - what style is it?
It's an Irish song. You can probably find it on YouTube.
That sounds good!
Yeah, it was fun exploring it. It was the first time I'd really listened to Irish folkmusic.
What other Irish songs do you like?
I like Loch Lomond - although I suppose that's more Scotch than Irish.
