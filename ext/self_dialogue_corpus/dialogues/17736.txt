Are you a Beatles fan?
I was a huge fan in the 60s, and I listened to their albums over and over, memorizing every word.
Did you ever see them in concert?
No--my mom and sister went to see them, but by them I was into Bob Dylan.
Really? You switched from the Beatles to Dylan?
Yeah, I had a boyfriend who thought Bob Dylan was amazing, so I kinda did it for that reason, but I do think Dylan is an amaing songwriter.
Did you ever see Dylan in concert?
Yes, I did, when I was 14. And after the concert I got the paper cup from the stage that he drank from. I was so excited!
Did you buy his records?
Of course--I had all of them. My parents, especially my mother, couldn't stand his voice and complained to me to keep the volume down.
Why did your boyfriend like him so much?
I think it was the lyrics...somehow they had special meaning to my boyfriend. He never talked about it, though.
Do you know his real name?
Sure, it's Rpbert Zimmerman. And I think he's from Hibbing, Minnesota.
He acts kinda strange at times. I saw him on TV live and he looked like he was in a trance.
I saw that, too. I attribute that to his distaste for fame and all the attention he got and still gets. I don't think he likes it.
He's a true poet, there's no doubt.
That and more. He spoke for a generation. Blowin' in the Wind is an incredible song.
And my favorite is Positively 4th Street.
I still remember the words to Maggie's Farm.
