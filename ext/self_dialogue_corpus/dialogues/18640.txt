Who is your favorite band?
No. Never cared for The Who?
Not The Who, dork!
Oh, my favorite band?
Yes!
No. Didn't like Yes either.
Arrrg! Which band is your favorite.
Past or present.
Sure.
Tom Petty and The Heart Breakers.
Now you're talking!
They were--are--so awesome!
I agree.
They toured close to us last year.
Did you go?
Couldn't afford it.
Huh?
It was like $200 per ticket.
What?!
Yeah, for the nose-bleeds, too.
