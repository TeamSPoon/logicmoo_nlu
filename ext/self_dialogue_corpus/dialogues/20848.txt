I love to watch any move with Tom Hanks.
So do I, he's one of my favorite actors.
What is your favorite movie with him in it?
I think maybe Forest Gump.
Forest Gump is such a unique movie.
Yeah, there isn't another movie even close to the same as it.
I like how they tell the story from a child into adulthood.
I do too, it really holds your interest and gives you a lot of insight into the characters.
It was so sad when Jenny died.
Yes, I wish she didn't have to die in the movie.
I would have liked to see them raise a big family together.
Me too, Forest was an awesome Dad.
He didn't seem to really realize the kind of person Jenny was.
I think he knew, but he knew the real Jenny all the way back to childhood.
What other Tom Hanks movies do you like/
I really liked Castaway.
That character that he plays is hysterical.
Yeah, it really makes you think how you would cope being all alone for years.
He did a good job portraying the character like that.
Yeah, he seemed to go a little out of his mind with his soccer ball, but he coped.
