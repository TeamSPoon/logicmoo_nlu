How do you feel about Scream?
For its genre it was not that bad
I liked the ensemble cast
Yeah that helped with the acting
I think that it really did a great job but they should have stopped at the first one.
Why  the second was better!
I think the scenes in the 2nd one relied too much on the first.
Yeah well it was almost the same premise.
Thats why they should have just done 1
Well thats not how they do it in horror movies in Hollywood
