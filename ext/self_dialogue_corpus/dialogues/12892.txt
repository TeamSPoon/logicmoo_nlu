Who is your favorite character from all of Star Wars?
Han Solo, for sure.
Not Luke Skywalker?
Nah, he's too whiny.  Like when he whines to Uncle Owen about getting converters in A New Hope.
Yeah, he was whiny.  My favorite character is Yoda.
Yoda?
Oh yeah.  He's so cute-- and pretty bad, considering his fight scene in Attack of the Clones.
Yeah, it was pretty awesome seeing him flip around.
Speaking of Attack of the Clones, what did you think about Boba Fett being a clone of Jango Fett?
I thought it was kinda lame, honestly.  Boba was one of my favorites, but I thought that backstory was weak.
