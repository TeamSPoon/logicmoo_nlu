What's your favorite movie of all time?
Oh that's definitely The Matrix, hands down. Great movie with a great message.
That's a great one but I'd have to say mine is Forrest Gump.
Oh I love Forrest Gump! He's got to be the most lovable character in movie history.
People don't realize he was actually a genius.
He really was, and I don't even mean just as an idiot savant. He understood and grasped things even we don't.
That's true. I love Tom Hanks in general. Have you ever seen Castaway?
Yes I've seen it like a million times. Broke my heart when he lost Wilson.
Oh I felt his pain. It was only a ball but it was his only companion.
Did you think it was right for Helen Hunt's character to move on?
Yes they had no idea when or if he was coming back. She couldn't just continue to put her life on hold.
That's true. Do you remember Girls Just Wanna Have fun with her and Sarah Jessica Parker?
That's from the 80s right? I think they were trying to get on a dance show.
That's right. I used to watch that over and over when I was a kid.
The 80s had the best movies hands down. Especially in the horror genre.
Oh Nightmare on Elm Street, Halloween, Friday the 13th... all bonafide classics.
Did you ever see the Rob Zombie reboot of Halloween?
Yes and I kind of liked it but I had a problem with him trying to humanize Michael Myers.
Why is that? It was good to have his background explained.
Well it means that you're no longer that afraid of him and his status as a psychopath with no cause sort of disappears.
