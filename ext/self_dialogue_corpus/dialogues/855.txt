Can the Patriots success ever be repeated?
No I am sure we are seeing a run that will never be seen again.
Do you think 10 super bowl wins is their goal?
Yes I think that will be it and then they will walk away.
Belichick and Brady?
Yes and it wouldnt shock me to see Kraft sell the franchise.
Why do you say that?
Does he want to go through trying to spark this all up again?
They could have a backup and maybe Matt Patricia take over
Yeah but it will be a let down for sure.
No I dont think so.
None of Belichick's assistants have ever done anything.
Or the GMs who have left
Yeah Pioli ruined Kansas City
None of their backups have had much success either.
Maybe its just the system
It is and I dont know if Patricia can repeat that
Yeah I know what you mean by that
So this might be their run then they come back down to Earth
Boston fans are going to have a tough time with that
