Who is your pick for best Disney character?
I think that Ariel from 'The Little Mermaid' takes the crown.
Out of all the characters, that's who you think is the best?
Yes, she is very likable, and she is in a great Disney movie.
I just think that there are so many choices that are better.
Okay, who do you think is the greatest Disney character?
I like Simba from The Lion King.
That's actually a pretty good pick.
We get to see him learn, grow, and come of age as a leader.
I like your explanation, but I still love Ariel the most.
