Hey, have you seen the movie Minority Report?
With Tom Cruise!  Yeah, a long time ago.
Yeah, it came out in 2002.  It's still a great movie, though.
I remember seeing it in the theatres!  Yeah it was incredible.
All of Steven Spielberg's movies are incredible though.  This is one of my favorites.
Yeah, the way it depicted the future was pretty interesting too wasn't it?
It was definitely fascinating.  Colin Farrell was great in it too.
Yeah, he's a great actor.  I wonder what year the movie was taking place in?
It was 2054 so we aren't there yet.
Oh, I didn't know that.  Well, it's about 37 years away.
It'll be interesting to see if we actually have any technology like that in the future.
Yeah, I kinda doubt it.  The Pre-cogs were neat though weren't they.
Oh yeah, they were fascinating.  What a mind to come up with a storyline like that.
I know.  Tom Cruise was so good in the movie too.
Yeah he was.  I thought a lot of parts were pretty sad.
Yeah, it made me sad about his family.  But it was redeeming at the end.
Yeah it was.  It had a great ending.
They should've made a sequel.  I could see a lot of potential there.
Well you never know.  Maybe they still will.
I guess it's possible.
