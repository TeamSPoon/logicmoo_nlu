What's your favorite Star Wars movie out of all of them?
I have to say that 'The Empire Strikes Back' holds a special place in my heart.
Really, why do you like that one so much?
I just really love the snow in the beginning, and I always love winter moments in movies.
Oh, that's kind of a silly reason.
I know, but it just makes me feel like I am there, or that I am really immersed in that world.
Okay, I can understand that justification.
I also like when Luke is in the swamps with Yoda.
Now that is a classic scene!
It's cool to see Yoda in his element, and to see Luke starting out as a Jedi.
