Why do you watch so many old movies?
Define old.
I mean, all this black-and-white stuff. It's so... stagey, and slow.
Some of it, yeah. But, you know, half the film ever made is in black-and-white.
I... guess? Where's the cutoff on this?
Depends. On a mass scale, let's say the 1950s -- but there was color film way back in the silent era.
So why did it take so long to catch on?
A bunch of reasons. The early technology was unstable and hard to use; for a long time it was way more expensive; and it was seen as a gimmick more than a strict improvement.
Seriously? How could people treat it like a gimmick?
Partly because it was new and used in a gimmicky way at first. Partly, it's just not fundamental to the medium.
How is it not fundamental? It's completing the picture.
Well, what picture? You're bringing in that notion from the outside.
The outside of what?
At its core, film is just about the juxtaposition of imagery over time. Color adds another visual dimension that can distract from the composition and values created from strict light and shadow.
But it's all two-dimensional. It's just a more accurate picture.
Accurate according to whom? The world of a film is a created world, that operates according to its own rules -- not necessarily the rules that you know.
But, I mean. It's photographed from real life, so.
Yeah, the imagery is captured from whatever makes the best picture -- but think of how much of that is false. You make sets, you cast the people who look best to act out lives they never lived.
Sure, because it's a story.
Exactly. It's a created universe, so why insist that it operate like the real world?
