How did you like the Beatle's Anthology.
There sure was a lot of stuff.
Yes. I like the different takes on the songs.
My reason for liking them is because it shows the creative process.
Yes. We were talking a bout The Long and Winding Road earlier.
That is the best non embellished cut.
Some say there were too many undeserving cuts on the Anthology.
Some people don't get it.
Yeah. They don't realize the point you made earlier
About the creative process, I think that is why it was put together that way.
