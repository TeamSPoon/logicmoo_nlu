Do you think NFL should have a celebration penalty?
I am not sure. I have over celebration though.
Yeah, it can be nerve racking.
I almost think it is too subjective to penalize though.
I could understand that.
I mean if they are going to penalize any, then they should just elimnate it all together.
I don't think that would ever happen.
Me either, but it would be the only way it is fair.
I think a lot of calls are subjective.
True. Some are just ridiculious.
That's why they made the challenges available.
But those don't work on flags and such.
Yeah, but it helps with some things.
It also hurts sometimes. I mean think about the give and take of the bad calls.
Yeah, it works both ways.
I just liked things back before evyer thing was reviewed.
Things did move quicker, but so much was overlooked.
You mean like bad calls.
Yes, the modern changes help make things more fair.
Maybe, but I liked it when is was more of a game than just fair.
