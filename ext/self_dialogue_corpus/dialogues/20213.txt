Did you see the preview for Dead Pool?
Of course! I wouldn't have missed it.
Wasn't it fantastic? There were so many great scenes! And, Ryan Reynolds nailed the character of Wade WIlson.
It was awesome!  My favorite scene was the opening sequence.
The slow mo action sequence was genius.  But, I laughed hardest during the montage of dates Wade and his girlfriend went on.
YES! The Calendar Girl montage!  Did you notice that the skipped from Lent to Halloween?
Well, in all fairness, I'm not sure, aside from 4th of July, you could make psuedo-sexual scenarios about Memorial Day and Labor Day.
You lack imagination.   But, ok.  What did you think of the two Xmen they introduced?
I thought Mega Sonic Teenage Warhead was perfectly cast!
No joke! She owned that role.   I loved the dynamic she had with Deadpool.
Their verbal sparring was legendary.
I agree.  And, every scene with Darpinder, in the cab, was magic.
I have a secret urge to see Darpinder become an Xman, now.  His superpower could be settling romantic disputes.
I think it would be awesome for Deadpool's Blind Roommate to become an Xman.
What would her super power be?
Building IKEA furniture and super-hearing.
Not bad.  Are you excited for the sequel?
Absolutely!  I saw the preview and it was hysterical.
Do you mean the one-off Musical where they sing "Gaston" from Beauty in the Beast or the Easter Egg where he changes in a phone booth?
I hadn't seen the musical preview but I will look it up when I get home.
