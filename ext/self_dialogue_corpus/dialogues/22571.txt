You know Micheal Keaton is coming back to Comic movies.
No way!
Yes, he will play a bad guy in a new Marvel movie.
Which movie?
The New Spider Man.
That one is called Homecoming, right?
Yes, it has a lot of famous actors.
Who else is in it?
Marissa Tomaine, and Zendaya.
I think it will be cool to see both of them.
I love Keaton in comic movies.
He has such a dry humor.
I thought he was a great sort of noir Batman.
Did you hear the new Batman is meant to be like the old ones?
What do you mean?
The director said he wanted it to be, "noir detective", style.
So Batman movies, will once again be like Batman movies.
Yes, I just hope Superman follows suit.
I hated how Batman Vs. Superman veered both of them into sort of anti-heroes.
Right, even Superman who in all his movies had been so wholesome.
