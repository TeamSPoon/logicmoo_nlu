What time is Eric's ball game today?
It starts at noon, but we're supposed to be there about 11:00.
Really?  Why an hour early.
The coach wants to talk to the parents.
Oh geez, let me guess... He's quitting.
I don't know.
I'll bet he's quitting.  That would make the third coach in two years.
Don't get ahead of yourself.
Well... It's hard not too.  It's frustrating.
I know, Eric loved baseball when he started with Coach Roberts.
Yeah, Roberts was a great coach, all the kids loved him
I get it though.  I mean, how much can a guy take?
I know! I would never have stayed as long as he did with all the crazy, screaming parents.
I'll never understand how two adult men can get into a fist fight over a little league baseball game.
Me either!  People are nuts!
Why can't they get into their heads it's just a little league game for fun!
They all take it like their kid is in the World Series.
If their kids had any real talent, they would playing in the pay leagues so just let them have fun and make mistakes
I'm surprised Roberts made it as long as he did.
I know I would never volunteer for it!
