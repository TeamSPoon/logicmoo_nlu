I was thinking today about some obscure songs and artists from the 1990s that I haven't heard in years.
What songs and artists were you thinking about.
Nobody in particular. Just some bands like the Mighty Mighty Bosstones, Sponge.
Oh, the Mighty Mighty Bosstones. Wow, I forgot all about them.
They were a good band. They had a unique sound.
They definitely were a good band. They kind of had a 1940's sounding style combined with a punk rock vibe.
That's one way to describe them.
I definitely liked the song Rascal King. That song brings back some good memories of the 90's.
That song was good. Thinking about other bands, do you remember Sponge?
I vaguely remember Sponge. I remember the Song Plowed.
That was definitely the song that came to mind when I was thinking about them today.
What are some other bands or songs you were thinking about?
Temple of the Dog, and The Cranberries.
Oh, the Cranberries. I loved them during High School. They were really unique. I also loved Temple of the Dog.
I think I was thinking about Temple of the Dog because of the news of Chris Cornell's recent passing.
Probably. He was only in his early 50's. So many artists succomb to either depression or drugs and go away so early.
He seemed to be a little depressed in some of his music writing, especially on his stint with Temple of the Dog.
Definitely in the Song Say Hello to Heaven.
That song was really depressing but had a lot of soul. Sometimes artists seem to speak through their music about how they are feeling.
I believe so. But I think he was writing that song as a tribute to another artist who passed away at an early age. Either way, you are right.
