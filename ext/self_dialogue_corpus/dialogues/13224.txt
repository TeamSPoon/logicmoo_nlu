Why is C3PO so annoying?
You don't like him?
Of course not.  He's a whiny robot with little worth.
R2D2 can obviously do more than him, but he's not worthless.
Think about most of his scenes.  He basically just says they're always in danger and going to die.
He also can compute things and help out with strategy.
Look, we'll just agree to disagree on this.  What role do you see him playing in the next few movies?
Not quite sure.  I know he'll be in them though.
My guess is maybe he'll do some sort of self-sacrifice to move the plot forward.
I could see that happening.
