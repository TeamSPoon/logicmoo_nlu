Do you like the original Star Wars movies or the new one?
I guess being older I like the original ones.
Who was your favorite character?
Boba Fett
Boba Fett? Really why Boba Fett? Although he is a prime character he never says anything?
I know, That is why I like him?
Seriously? Can you explain?
Sure. Darth Vader if narcissist and talks about himself, Luke talks about "Whoa is me, I'm the victim" and Leya talks about saving the world. Boba Fett is quiet, does his job, and causes no issues.
Well that might make sense on a basic level, but you do realize that there is more to the movie than that on a deeper level, right?
Yup but you didn't ask me that?
