Do you think they'll bring Leia back?
Only if they already have the footage.
Why do you say that?
The Fisher Estate won't allow it.
Huh?
They won't allow any electronic recreation of her image.
Sad.
So, I hope they already filmed her.
Me too.
Knowing Disney, They probably already have the other two movies in the can.
