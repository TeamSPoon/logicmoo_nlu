So what do the winning players for the Super Bowl get?
They each get a ring and a bonus.
I figured about the bonus. How much do they get?
I think it's a little over one hundred thousand.
That's a huge bonus.
You know the losers get a bonus, too.
For losing the game?
I think of it more as an incentive to play their best.
So how much do they get?
They each got fifty three thousand dollars in this year's game.
So about half?
That sounds right.
Have the players always gotten bonuses?
Yes. It started with the first Super Bowl.
How much did they get?
The winners got fifteen thousand dollars and the losers got seventy five hundred.
So it was about half the money for the losers back then, too.
That's right.
That certainly is a good way to get the players to do their best.
I think that's the whole point of it.
