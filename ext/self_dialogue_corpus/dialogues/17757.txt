Do you like modern rap?
Not really but I used to like rap a lot more
Why did you stop liking rap?
They just mumble now. Future is guilty of it and so it Lil Uzi Vert
Are there any good rappers?
I like Kendrick Lamar a lot
Why is he? His name sounds familiar
Have you heard Bad Blood by Taylor Swift?
Is that the song where she sings "Oh, it's so sad to think about the good times You and I..."
Yeah that's the song!
Oh okay, yeah I know it then!
So in that song the rap verse is by Kendrick Lamar
Do you remember any cool lines from his verses?
You have to know before I tell you that it's not his best work
That's okay, what are some lines from Bad Blood?
"I don't hate you but I hate to critique, overrate you These beats of a dark heart, use basslines to replace you"
Those are some cool lines. Everything rhymes, like Eminem does it!
Eminem is a big fan of Kenrick Lamar, did you know that?
No, I didn't know that!
Yeah they have a couple of songs where they rap together!
