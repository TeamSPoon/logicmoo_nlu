I am listening the last album of the Red Hot Chili Peppers
I had no idea they released a new album, how is it called?
The Getaway
Is it the one with a little girl and a bear in the cover?
Yes! Have you listened their single Dark Necessities?
Not sure, will you play it for me?
Sure, here have my earphones...
Wow! This is Red Chili Peppers at their best, I love it.
The story of the single is pretty cool, they announced on Twitter the release of the song three days later, the anticipation was overwhelming
Well, The Red Hot Chili Peppers are always extravagant in their ways
I heard they are coming to town in two months, will you be interested in going?
I am! Let me check the date and the price of the ticket and I will give you an answer soon
What is your favorite album?
I have to go with Blood Sugar Sex Magik  is old but to me is their best
So you really like funk rock
Yes, love it. It also happens to be the album they released when I was in High School, so it has an emotional meaning for me
Yeah I can relate to that, after all they are the best Funk Rock/alternative band ever, that is my humble opinion
Not only yours I do agree totally with you
Then lets go to their concert for the sake of old memories!
Ok, you got me, Red Hot Chili Peppers, here we go!
