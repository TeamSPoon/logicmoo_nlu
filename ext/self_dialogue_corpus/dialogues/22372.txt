So Tom Holland is going to play Nathan Drake in the Uncharted movie.
Wait but he's a kid.
Yeah it's going to be an origin story about young Nate.
That can work on some level but are they planning to make it a franchise then?
What do you mean?
I mean that I think just one movie about the origins of Nathan Drake won't be good on its own.
You don't think that's a good enough standalone story?
Well when I think of an Uncharted movie I think of charming explosive action.
Yeah I guess we don't really get that with Tom Holland.
We don't really get that with anybody really.
Video game movies don't tend to turn out so well so I'm not too full of hope.
Exactly, look at Assassin's Creed.
Bombed so hard, even with really big names attached to the project.
Yeah you see Michael Fassbender and think that whoa this might be good.
I actually thought Warcraft was pretty good but only if you're a Warcraft fan.
Yeah that was full of fan service for those who like the games.
Duncan Jones made sure of that I think, he had the fans in mind.
It's a shame it might not get a sequel, lots of potential in other stories.
Yeah the story of the first movie was kind of hard to follow.
Yeah especially if you haven't played the games.
