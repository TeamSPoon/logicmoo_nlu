One of my favorite movies of all time and guilty pleasure is "Galaxy Quest". Have you seen it?
Oh, the one starring "Tim the Toolman Taylor"?!
Ha, ha, yes, it had Tim Allen in it as the Captain of the ship, The Galaxy Quest.
Wasn't that a take-off on "Star Trek, the Original Series"?
Yes...Tim's character was supposed to be like Captain Kirk. But Alan Rickman's character was even better at sot of paralleling Spock.
Yeah...it sort of poked at Yeoman Rand, too.
What do you mean? Sigourney Weaver's character?
Yeah, she was all boobs, and the fans all thought that she was having an affair with the Captain.
I guess you could say that it was close on, but I get the feeling her character doing that "repeating the computer" thing was from another series.
I guess so. Maybe something like "Space 1999", or "UFO".
I just adored the bits where the guy from "Monk", Tony Shaloob - was tryign to impress the alien girl.
Yeah, that stoned engineer character was hilarious! I loved that moment when the security guard screams out, "Oh, no, that's just not right!" as Tech Sgt. Chen makes out with the alien chick.
The crew of that ship were actually all squids or something, right?
Yeah. And they had some sort of transmuting device that made them look almost human.
I loved how they walked, as though they still had eight limbs!
Definitely a funny movie, although once you've seen it, it really isn't as funny as the first time.
Oh, I disagree! Each time I watch it, I find something funny that I didn't notice before.
Like what?
Like Tech Sgt. Chen inspecting the Engineering deck, and all he has to say is, "Wow, look at the clean floors!"
I guess you're right, it IS a guilty pleasure!
