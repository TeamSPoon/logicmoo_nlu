What are some underrated Disney movies?
I actually have a few I loved as a kid.
I only know the more famous ones.
There was one called "The Sword in the Stone".
I never seen it.
It was about Arthur, from the Camelot legend, but as a kid.
Did it have Merlin?
It did. He was more like the Genie in Alladin, a magical time traveler etc.
So they copied Alladin?
No, it came out like fifty years before Alladin.
