What do you think of the new Metallica?
You're kidding right?
What do you mean?
Theyre still putting out music? I abandoned them after the Black album.
Dude arent you loyal to your bands?
Are they loyal to me or their pockets?
Man they released like 8 albums since then.
And they all stink I'm sure.
Doubt it, but I never heard much of their old stuff.
stop talking to me.
Haha. are you serious??
Look Metallica at one time did what they wanted and thats it.
And now? What do they do now?
Dont know. But they used to be at play-used to take you through a heavy metal journey in each song.
Sounds interesting, how so?
They'd start off slow, then toughen up that same riff with drums and distortion, then go back, and come around again.
They still do some of that in the new stuff.
Nah. Since the black album they shortened their songs for radio play.
I like hearing them on the radio.
But it killed them. Their songs used to meander in a beautiful way, wondering on a landscape then soaring to another. Not anymore! Radio dont lie that.
