got a favorite slipknot album
i love iowa
that album is so dark
corey taylor said the band was in such a bad place during the album
they were drinking and doing a lot of drugs
apparently the album was such a blur to them
but they made a great metal masterpiece
its a wonder how they managed to do that
but i guess it kinda shows in coreys vocals
he just sounds like he doesnt care
if youre drunk, you dont care
he just wanted to spit venom
to just scream as loud and as vicious as he could
it worked out well
i liked self titled too
who doesnt? wait and bleed
that was their first big single
i remember when i first heard it
i was so scared of them before
they were creepy with the masks
