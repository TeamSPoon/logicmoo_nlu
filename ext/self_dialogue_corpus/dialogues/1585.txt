Did you see the 49ers play the Bears last night?
No, both of those teams are terrible.
Yep, I agree. I only watched it because I was bored.
What was the final score?
Bears won 26 to the 49ers 6 points.
That's really bad. The 49ers could only get one touchdown.
Yes, and they missed a field goal.
That's almost unbelievable. Who started at QB for the 49ers?
Gabbert got the start.
How many passing yards did Gabbert throw for?
Gabbert only threw for a measly 35 yards.
Wow. That's crazy. What did Chicago's QB do?
I think Barkley threw for about 192 yards.
Well, it's no surprise that his team won the game.
Yes, I completely agree.
How many rushing yards did the 49ers get?
The 49ers got 141 rushing yards as a team.
Oh, that's more than I thought they would get.
Yes, overall it was a pretty sad game.
I'm glad I didn't watch it.
