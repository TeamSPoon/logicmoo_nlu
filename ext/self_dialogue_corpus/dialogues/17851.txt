Have you heard of Alestorm?
What a weird name. Are they any good?
It's a fun band from Scotland with songs about pirates and drinking.
Do you know how long they have been active?
Think they've only been active for the last ten years.
Have they given out many albums in that time?
They have released five albums. No Grave But The Sea is their most recent one.
What kind of music do they play?
It's been defined as Folk\Power Metal.
What an interesting style. Any particular reason they are defined as Folk Metal?
Think it has to do with the kinds of instruments they end up using. Oh and how catchy some of their songs are.
Any instruments of note that they use?
They use the trumpet and violin in quite a few of their songs.
I guess those things can help make it sound a bit more folksy.
You should check out some of their music videos
Oh do you have any that you recommend?
Drink and Magnetic North have fun music videos. You should be able to find them on Youtube.
