Hey, what's your favorite Beatles' song.
Oh that's a tough question. Probably Yellow Submarine.
Oh right, that's a classic.
What's yours?
I love A Hard Day's Night.
Yeah, that's got some really great lyrics.
Did you ever see that movie with their music. I forget what it's called.
Oh, do you mean Across the Universe?
Oh, that's the one! I loved that movie.
Me too. I used to listen to the soundtrack all the time.
