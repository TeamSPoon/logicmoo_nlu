Hey man, I can't hardly wait until football season!
Yeah! College football looks great, but NFL should be even better!
What do you think about the teams in Los Angeles?
You mean the Rams and the Chargers?
Yeah! That's really interesting how the Chargers ended up moving to LA too!
I don't know that LA fans really care about either of the NFL teams in their city.
What do you mean? Everyone likes NFL football.
LA already has two great football teams. UCLA Bruins and the USC Trojans.
But that's college ball, and it's different from NFL.
Yeah, but I really don't think LA fans want one team, much less two crowding up their city even further.
True, what's the point of going to a game in Carson if it's going to take you half a day sitting in traffic to get there and get home?
Plus it's such a small stadium. I know they're going to build a new one in the future, but it's a soccer stadium as is.
So what was your favorite thing about last season?
My favorite thing? The fact that the Patriots showed everyone that they were boss, and that "deflate-gate" was all nonsense!
What do you mean by that?
Man, I feel like ESPN just wanted to crucify Tom Brady. By winning the superbowl, even with his beginning of the season suspension, he just proved to everyone that he really is the best quarterback in the league, playing on the best team in the league.
Yeah, but they almost got beat!
Right, but they came back from being down two scoring drives to win! It's like running the boston marathon, never give up!
Alright, dude. Nice talking to you. When the season starts up, I'm coming over!
Just bring the beer!
