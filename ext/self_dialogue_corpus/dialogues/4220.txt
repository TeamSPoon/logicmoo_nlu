I'm going to go see that new M. Night. Shyamalan movie tonight.
The one about the kids visiting their grand parents? I've seen that one.
No. The Visit was out last year. It was pretty good too.
Oh so he's got a new one already?
Yeah, it's called Split. James McAvoy is starring in it.
Is Joaquin Phoenix in it too? He was in a couple of M. Night movies before.
No he's not. He wasn't in The Visit either.
I know. I miss that kind of continuity. So what's Split about?
All I know is that some nutcase with dozens of personalities kidnaps a bunch of teenage girls.
Let me know how it turns out.
