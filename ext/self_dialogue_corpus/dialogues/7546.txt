I wish the movies were more faithful
What does faithful mean
It means they are not that faitful
How so
Well they leave many of the small details out of the books out
Well you know they do that to be concise
What does concise mean
I mean it is be natural and not drawn out
But we wanted a faithful adaption
I think it is
