Can you think of a really scary horror movie to watch tonight?
How about watching a movie called Willow Creek?
What kind of movie is it? What's the it's about?
It is a found footage type of movie and it's about Bigfoot.
So they make a video of Bigfoot in the movie?
Well you'll have to watch the movie to find that out. The main characters do bring a video camera with them on a camping trip.
Why do they have a video camera while camping. That sounds unrealistic.
The reason given in the movie is that the couple are actually making a documentary about Bigfoot sighting in the area they're camping in.
Oh cool. So it's just two people in the whole movie.
Well, there are a few other minor characters but yes, most of the movie is just about couple in their 30's making a Bigfoot documentary.
