Have you ever heard of Twista?
Is that the rapper that raps fast?
It is! His flow is incredible.
He was featured on the song "Slow Jamz," wasn't he?
He was! Do you think he is the fastest rapper in the world?
It is quite possible. I wonder if there is a world record for rapping.
If there is, I bet he holds it.
Do you know any other rappers that are incredibly fast?
Busta Rhymes and Watsky also have an incredibly fast flow.
Good to know! I will have to check out too.
