What is your favorite Harry Potter movie?
I like the first one.
Yeah, that one was very cool.
I like the story and how he figures out who he is.
What did you think of the other movies?
They were good, but not as good as part 1.
Did you like how it all ended?
Yeah, it was cool. I wish they kept making more though.
Yeah, me too. They are all good movies.
I think it is one of the best movies to be made from a book.
