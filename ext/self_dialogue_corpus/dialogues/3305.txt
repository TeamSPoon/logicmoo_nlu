What's your favorite horror movie?
It's hard for me to say actually. How about you?
One of my favorites is Dawn of the Dead.
I absolutely love zombie films. Have you seen Resident Evil?
I seen a few of them but i haven't caught up on the last two films.
The Final Chapter is so worth checking out.
I know the first 3 movies in the franchise were really good.
Yeah, Extinction was probably my favorite of them all.
I would like to see a Resident Evil mash up movie with Evil Dead.
Wow, that actually sounds like a great idea.
