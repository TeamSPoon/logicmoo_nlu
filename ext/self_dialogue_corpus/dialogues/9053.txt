Do you think Journey is going to keep touring?
Why wouldn't they?
Well there's some drama between Neal Schon and Jonathan Cain.
But there's always drama in that band.
That's true. I want them to reunite with Steve Perry.
I doubt that will ever happen. I just want Steve's new solo record.
Wait, he's working on a solo project?
That's what he recently.
I'd buy that in a hearbeat!
Me, too! I hope his voice hasn't changed too much over the years.
