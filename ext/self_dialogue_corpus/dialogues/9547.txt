What do you think about Drake?
I don't really care for him.
Why not?  I think he's a pretty good rapper.
He seems talented enough, but he just seems fake.
Why do you say that?
My little sister used to watch a kids show that he was on.  Now he's trying to come out all hard.
Oh, so it kills the vibes.
Exactly.  I just see him as a guy on a kid's show.
I wonder how many of his fans from that show listen to him now.
He actually changed his name, so I don't know.
