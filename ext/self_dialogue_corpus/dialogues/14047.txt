Have you ever seen Lady Gaga live?
No, I haven't. But I'd really love to! Have you?
Yes, I saw her perform on the Today Show a few years back. She was great.
That's awesome! What's your favorite Lady Gaga song?
I really like her new song "Million Reasons".
I haven't heard that one yet, I'll have to check it out.
You should, it's a really touching song. What about you?
I like most of her older work. But they're all so good I can't choose!
I know what you mean, she's a great artist.
Yep! She's the best.
