I miss the big personalities in NFL football.
Like whom?
I'd say Ochocinco was one of them.
Gotta love Ocho.
He was a good player too.
Yes he was.
The players now seem drab.
Not all of them.
Is Tom Brady still playing?
Not sure.
Peyton Manning also has big personality.
Yes, him and his brother.
For me, it's about star quality.
Those are the ones that stand out!
They're no longer reality tv football stars.
True.
That was big about 10 years ago.
Those were the years.
Guess it's not bad that they're sticking to the craft.
Not at all.
