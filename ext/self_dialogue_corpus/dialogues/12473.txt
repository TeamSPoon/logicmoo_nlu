So what do you think of the new character Rey?
Shes interesting.  Has a lot of potential.
Agreed.  She seems to have a lot of skill using the force and she hasnt even trained yet.
Heck yeah she did!  Did you see that lightsaber battle?
Um, yeah!  She did pretty well against someone who has been training for years!
True, though that was a little unbelievable.
Yeah, and she seems to be able to use the force against him pretty well too.
Again, a little unbelievable.
Well hopefully the explain this in the next movie.
They better!  I want to know whats going to happen!
