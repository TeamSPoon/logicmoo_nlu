Have you ever seen Garth Brooks in concert?
No I haven't, I wish I did though.
His concerts are really good I have heard.
You have never seen him either?
Unfortunately, no.
What is your favorite song of his?
There are quite a few, The Thunder Rolls is probably my favorite.
That is a good one.
What is your favorite song that he sings?
I really like friends in low places.
Me too.
We should see him in concert.
I don't think he goes on tour anymore.
We missed our chance then.
Well, we missed our chance to see him live, but we still have the albums.
Very true let's listen to one now.
Which album would you like to listen to?
How about no fences?
Yes that is a good one.
I agree, I will play it now.
