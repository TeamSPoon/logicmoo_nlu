Hey, have you seen all the Star Wars movies?
I've seen some, but definitely  not all. How many are there?
I'm not sure. I think there are maybe seven that have been made so far.
Yeah, i definitely saw the original three made back in the day.
Yeah me too. And i've seen three of the newer ones.
I think i've only seen two. I know the last one was The Force Awakens, but i didn't see it
Yeah, that's the one i have not seen.
Great films though. There's like a whole mythology to them with some interesting spiritual concepts thrown in
Yes, i agree. There's definitely some philosophical stuff in them
Yes, thought provoking.
