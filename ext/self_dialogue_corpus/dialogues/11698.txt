Who do you think is the best beatle?
John lennon I think without him they would never have gotten off the ground.
That may be very true, but really any group is just that a group effort.
yes, but Lennon was behind so much of the music's creation.
I do agree somewhat. But I kind of see him as the one who broke the band up.
I think that was more on Yoko.
Oh please John was a grown up man and made the choices he made for himself .
But I think he was so in love with yoko he was swayed by her and his desire to be with her always.
Perhaps. They did have that sit in at the hotel in Montreal. That was actually pretty cool.
I think that was one of the most important stands he and yoko took together.
