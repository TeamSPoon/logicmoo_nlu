I wish I could see Pink Floyd live some time.
Are you ok with seeing a cover band?
Sure, if they're good at all.
Yeah they sound just like them.
What's their name?
They're called The Machine, after the song Welcome to the Machine.
Oh I know that one, cool.
Yeah they're not too expensive to see either.
That's good news. How convincing are they?
Well they don't look like the regular band members of course, but their sound is spot on.
Nice. Do they do all the popular stuff?
Yeah they do the whole Animals and The Wall albums.
Do they do anything off of Dark Side of the Moon?
Of course they do, that's one of the most popular albums.
Oh, right.
They don't have any original stuff that I know of though.
That's a shame, I'm sure they could write something similar to Pink Floyd.
You would think so.
What are their shows like?
Very good, lots of lights and sound effects just like the original band.
