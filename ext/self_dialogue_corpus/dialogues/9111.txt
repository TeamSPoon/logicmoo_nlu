What is your favorite decade for rock music?
I think it would be the 70s.
You don't mean disco, do you?
No, I mean guitar bands.
I like that too. What is one of the bands?
I think Cheap Trick was great.
I don't remember them. What did they sing?
Do you remember the song I want you to want me?
Oh yeah. That is really catchy.
That's one of my favorite rock songs of all time.
