Want to come over and watch "Rogue One" this weekend? I just got it on DVD.
Sure, that movie was awesome! I'd love to see it again.
What was your favorite scene?
Hmm, that's a tough one, there was so much to like in that movie. I'd have to go with the Darth Vader scene at the end of the movie though.
Oh yeah, that was something else. I don't think I even breathed during that scene, it was so intense!
Right? Darth Vader is such a great villain. His storyline throughout the series is one of my favorites!
Yeah, such a great character. I did like many of the new characters in "Rogue One" though too, even if they didn't make it past the end of the movie.
Yeah, Jynn and Cassian were great leads.
And who could forget K2-SO! Haha
Oh yeah, he was the best and really brought up some great dialogue between the main group of rebels.
