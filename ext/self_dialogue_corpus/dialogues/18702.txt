Hey what are you doing today?
Not much. I've just been listening to some music.
What kind of music are you listening to?
Mostly pop and country and a little R and B every so often.
Don't you ever listen to rap?
Well, I don't really know any good rappers. Do you know of any?
Yes, I love rap! You have Eminem, Lil Wayne, Drake, Kanye West, and 50 Cent.
Of all of those I have only heard of Eminem.
Yeah he definitely has some great songs. My favorites are Mockingbird and Lose Yourself.
I think I have heard of Lose Yourself before and it was okay.
When I think of rap, the number one artist of all time would have to be Tupac Shakur.
I have heard his name before but I have never heard any of his songs. What are his biggest hits?
Well you have Dear Mama, Changes, Ghetto Gospel, Hit Em Up, and California Love.
I will have to check those out and see.
Rap is pretty underrated. Not much people listen to it these days.
Are there any good female rappers?
Oh yeah! There's Nicki Minaj, Iggy Azalea, Lauryn Hill, and you can't leave out Missy Elliot.
The only one of those I have heard of is Nicki Minaj.
They are all pretty good. You should give them a listen and see what you think.
Yeah I will. I would like to broaden my musical files.
