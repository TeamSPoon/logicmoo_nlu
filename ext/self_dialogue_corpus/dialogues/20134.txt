so what do you think of gone with the wind.
oh i think it was a great movie, but it had its time you know what i mean?
no i dont know what you mean .
oh you know the racist overtones to say it lightly that are in the movie are very offensive.
ok but how is it racist if that how people really were back them.
no i know what you mean, back then it racism was accepted it was the norm,. but now it is very racist by our politically correct standards.
yes but i don't think its fair. the african americans in the movie were not portrayed in a really bad light.
i think though if we continue to watch this type of movie it might make some white people think thats its ok to continue in this manner
yes i supposed that could be true.
i know the technical side of the movie were amazing for back then 1939.
i thought the acting was good too, especially vivien leigh. she's british you know.
ya i also heard that she and clark gable didn't like each other.
its funny she's a british girl and had to do a southern girls accent but clark refused to so a southern accent. it you listen he has no accent at all.
hey that's right captain butler has no southern accent, i never thought about that.
also clark had the original director removed because he thought he was a lady director.
what does that mean lady director?
he was used to directing women movies, you know with female in the lead.
who was the director and who came on as the new director ?
george cukor was the first director and victor fleming took over.
wow i never knew that. the first director must not have been too different from the second one you can't tell in the movie where the perspective changes.
