I still cannot believe they left the universe of i robot where it was
I know it was ripe for more
It would have been cool
But they have to keep will smith
Well yeah he is the integral part of the movie
He is the perfect person for  the role
Yeah no one else could fill him as the main
I want to watch it again
Well i can put it on
Can you?!
