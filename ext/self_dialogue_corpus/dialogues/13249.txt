The Star Wars soundtrack is so iconic... It gets stuck in my head all the time!
Mine too! Especially the song that plays when Darth Vader walks on screen.
Right! It's so sinister, it's perfect for him.
The other bits of the soundtrack are great too. It always makes me so nostalgic.
I wonder if the soundtrack for the new films will feel like way in another ten years?
They might! People seemed to really enjoy The Force Awakens.
When does the next one come out?
It's supposed to be this September!
Great! What's it called?
"The Last Jedi."
