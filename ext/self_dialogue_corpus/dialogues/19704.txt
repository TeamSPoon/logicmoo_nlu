Do you think Woodstock is ever held again?
For sure but I haven't heard much about it.
It was a great festival.
So what year do they do it?
Should he 2019.
So that's pretty close.
Technically the last one was in 1999.
Do you think it will be all rock bands?
The last one wasn't
So they'll mix it up?
Yes I am not sure pop singers will be present though.
Could they even pull it off?
I think so and musically it would be great.
I think the acoustics of it would be tough.
They do it every year for warped tour.
But this is a once every 25 year festival.
The last one ended miserably.
I heard that.
Security needs to be beefed up.
I hope they stream the concert on Netflix.
