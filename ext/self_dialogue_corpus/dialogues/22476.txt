So let's say you had to pick one Batman movie, it has to be the best. Which one?
Does it have to be the Nolan ones ?
Nope. Any Batman movie. There is a lot.
I like Batman Returns. Dark and classic.
I think it was just funny enough. Do you think they hold up still?
With all the different movies with all the different directors and main characters?
Yeah. I think the new films make them hold up even better. They had a sense of junior.
I think superhero movies need a bit of humor. Like the comics they come from.
I think the Nolan Batman movies lost that a bit.
They were more serious renditions.
I wish they would of added more than just a few jokes in that movie.
They were a bit sad. Like very little comic relief.
That's why I like the old ones too. The comedy.
The older ones really stayed true to the sad, but also that funny Batman humoir.
Very dry and overly over done villains?
Yes! Poison ivy, the old joker. Made the films fun.
Did you think the Nolan joker was good?
I think he was the joker his movie needed.
I see what you did there. I think he made the movie more real
That movie was better with him in it for sure.
