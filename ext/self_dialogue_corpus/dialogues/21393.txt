Did you watch any more Cohen Brothers movies?
I watched A Serious Man last week.
What did you think of it?
I really did not enjoy it at all.
That is one of my favorites, what didn't you like?
Everything, I did not get the point of it and it was just boring to me.
What would you say is your favorite movie of theirs?
I would probably say No Country for Old Men or Fargo.
Both of those are classics.
Yea, I like No Country a little bit more but it might just be because it is more modern.
Yea, that movie looks amazing visually, though Fargo does too.
Yea, it is amazing how old Fargo is and how good it still is.
It is one of those movies that people long from now will still know.
Yep, just like The Big Lebowski.
Oh yea, people will always watch and love that one.
I used to like it a lot more.
Yea, I feel like with repeated viewings it does not hold up as well.
I agree, though I still enjoy watching it once in a while.
Of course, almost all of their movies are that good.
I agree, just about all of them.
