Do you think The Fast and the Furious was very successful?
I assume it was, since they made tons of other ones.
I guess so. Part 1 had the most heart.
Every scene was unique and had good acting.
I liked the party scene. You could tell Paul Walker and Vin Diesel were gonna be good friends.
There were a lot of twists and turns in the film.
I liked when it was revealed that Paul Walker was a cop.
I was not expecting that.
I agree. It was cool though how they kept it secret for awhile.
Yes. The story was full of surprises.
