Do you think they'll come out with another Sherlock Holmes movie?
Probably not.
Well, maybe not with Robert Downey Jr.
True, there are dozens of Sherlock movies.
But I really liked Downey in those.
He was reall good.
So was Jude Law.
Yeah, I wasn't expecting to like him so much as Watson.
Me neither.
The first movie was definitely better.
I agree. The villian was really good.
He sure was. Very dark.
What is that actors name.
I'm not sure, but I've seen him before.
Yeah, he played Merlin in the spy movie.
Merlin? What are you talking about.
You know that movie with Samuel L. Jackson as the villian.
Oh, yeah! Kingsmen.
Yeah, that's the one.
That was a terrific movie.
