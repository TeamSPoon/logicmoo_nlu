Ooh, I like your blouse. It's so soft and flowy. And that color is gorgeous on you.
Thank you. The blouse is polyester, and the color is Millennial pink.
Millennial pink? I think I've heard of that. But we're hardly Millenials, dear.
Anyone can wear it, darling. Even you.
Thanks, I guess. But it's not really a pink-y pink, is it? It's almost a beige.
But not quite. For your information, there are a whole range of Millennial pinks.
From sugar sweet to sticky?
No, none  of them is sticky. And each is sweet in its own way.
Like you. Why is it called Milennial?
Supposedly because the Millennials, those rising young twerps, prefer this pink to all other shades.
All others. Why?
Because, my dear, it's all their own. Also it's grown-up, assertive, and unafraid of its own nature.
This color is unafraid?
Well, perhaps those who wear it are. Or perhaps the color itself inspires audacity.
But you, sweetheart, are no Millennial. Why are you  wearing this subtle but engaging color?
To show I know that's-what by keeping up with the times. In short, to be in fashion.
Being in fashion shows you know what's what?
Yep. how else could I demonstrate that to a total stranger?
Amazing. What a woman you are.
Yes I am. But I think this pink is fading. I'm going to get you a beautiful green tie.
