What are the worst Marvel movies to you?
I think they're all overdone to some extreme.  Give me a specific character.
Sure.  What do you think of Iron Man?
Hate Iron Man.  Hate all of the films really.
Hate or dislike?
Both I guess. The first one was tolerable, but the last two were awful.
And why do you say that?
Because Iron Man is completely unlikable.  He's a rich jerk who never learns anything.
I guess you have me there.  He doesn't really have much character building.
Right.  The Marvel universe doesn't seem interested in changing him.
What made the first movie different from the rest?
The first one was kind of the start of the new Marvel movies so it was unique.
They were kind of feeling their way into the universe.
It was a good origin story.  I like the whole desert part.
Where he was held hostage and eventually got out?
Right.  It was a solid setup and origin story.
So what was different about the last two movies?
He was no longer a sympathetic character.  He was rude to everyone.
Including his assistant.  Pepper I think her name was.
Correct.  He gave her crap all the time and it wasn't welcome hence why the last few movies were garbage.
