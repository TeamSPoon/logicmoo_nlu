Did you ever see Cabin in the Woods?
Yes it was amazing! I love the twist at the end.
Me too I loved how they poked fun of the horror genre while still creating something scary and fun.
I thought it was a typical horror movie then they came out of left field with the whole sacrifice plot.
Yes it was a shocker. The scene where all the monsters were let loose and caused carnage, that was epic.
I thought it was funny that they hit on the character types that seem to be formulaic in all the movies.
Right they had the virgin, the not-so-virgin, the jock, the smart guy, and the stoner.
Right you see them in every scary movie.
I loved how they basically ended the world because one of them didn't want to be sacrificed. That was so selfish.
It really was, but it's a movie after all. Can't expect everyone to have high morals.
