What was your favorite movie when you were a kid?
I'd have to say it was Aladdin. That, or maybe Cinderella.
You mean the classic Cinderella of course, right?
Oh, absolutely! What about you? What was your favorite movie as a kid?
Mine was probably The Little Racals.
Oh, man. That is a classic! I loved Porky in it, and also how they featured Whoopi Goldberg.
She was great as Buckwheat's mother. You know what other classic movie I love?
Could it be...The Breakfast Club?!
That's the one! I could watch that movie over and over and never get sick of it.
Same here, along with Sixteen Candles.
Molly Ringwald was amazing in that. I really miss seeing her in her younger days.
She was an amazing actress. She still is, but the movies she was featured in back then were all so cool.
I know! You knew if you saw her in the credits, it was going to be a good movie.
For sure. What about newer movies? Have you seen any lately?
The latest movie I saw was the kid's movie Trolls. It was a super cute movie.
I love that movie! It has to be one of my most well-loved modern kid's movies.
It sure was entertaining! I coudn't believe I loved watching it so much!
Yes! That and Finding Dory were both awesome.
I saw that one as well and loved it. What about How to Train Your Dragon?
Oh, of course! That's another favorite one of mine!
