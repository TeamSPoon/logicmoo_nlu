What's your favorite movie that I'd never expect you to love?
Definitely You've Got Mail.
Really? The Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan movie?
Indeed. Nora Ephron wrote it and she's great.
I always found it funny that Dave Chappelle was in that movie.
Yeah, I don't think he's done many romantic dramas.
Is that your favorite Tom Hanks film?
It really might be. And Harry Nilsson is all over the soundtrack and he's great.
Isn't it very much like Sleepless in Seattle?
People say that, but I think it's quite different. The emotional feel isn't the same.
And Meg Ryan has shorter hair.
Yeah, and You've Got Mail has Parker Posey. Sleepless in Seattle wishes Parker acted in it.
You know, I recently saw Heather Burns in Manchester by the Sea. I recognized her from You've Got Mail.
How was Manchester?
It was pretty good. It wasn't quite as depressing as I expected, but some sequences are so heartbreaking.
I haven't seen it yet so don't tell me anymore.
Oh, yeah. I've become one of those people who avoids watching film trailers.
Me, too. You can't watch a trailer without having a bunch of quality moments spoiled.
Teasers have become the way to go.
I do have an appreciation for teasers that leave you thinking, "I'm not sure what this is, but I want to see it."
