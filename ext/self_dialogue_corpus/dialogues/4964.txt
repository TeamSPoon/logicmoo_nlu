How do you feel about the players wearing pink this weekend?
It looks stupid to be honest.
I could see them using pink bats and thats it
Yeah that seems better, some of these uniforms look terrible.
How come they never do anything for Father's Day?
No idea, very strange.
I think alot of the parks are going to be geared towards mothers day today.
Yeah they will, alot of pink bats.
Its good to raise awareness
For what?
I believe its breast cancer.
Baseball pays homage to alot of causes.
Yeah its good to see that sort of philanthropic sense in the game.
Do you think we see advertisements on jerseys ever?
No they have enough room in the park
I agree, I just dont know how OK with it they are.
I think you will see some sort of bizarre advertising, maybe on the bats.
You can barely see them when theyre being swung.
I know but theyll capitalize on something.
Each pitch will be brought to you by a different sponsor.
