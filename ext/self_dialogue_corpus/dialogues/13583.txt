No.  I thought it was a very poor attempt at reaching younger audiences.

No.  I think Star Wars is acceptable for all ages in general.

Mostly.  I think J.J. Abrams did a mediocre job, though he is better suited for Star Wars than Star Trek.

I would say my favorite is Episode V, The Empire Strikes Back.
