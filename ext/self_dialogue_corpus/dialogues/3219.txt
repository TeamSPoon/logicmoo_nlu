Do you like horror movies
Sometimes
Have you seen the blair witch project?
No it looks kind of dumb to me
It was a little dumb
And i dont like movies with the camera like that
Yea i understand that, it hurts my head
I dont know why movie companies think its a good idea
I dont either
Its an awful idea
