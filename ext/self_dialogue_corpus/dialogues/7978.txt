What's one pop song you can listen to on repeat over and over?
Yes, I know what repeat means, thanks. Have you heard of Deep Blue Something?
Nope. What's that?
It's a 90's band who just recently reunited.
What was their biggest hit?
Their only hit you'll recognize: Breakfast at Tiffany's?
Right! They're a one-hit-wonder then?
Yeah, which stinks for them as they've put out a lot of albums.
Why did you listen to it a lot?
My prom date and I had it as our favorite song. We listened to it constantly.
