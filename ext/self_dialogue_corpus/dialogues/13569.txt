So, Kylo Ren and the Knights of Ren are Siths, right?
No, no, no. They can't be.
Well, why not? They use the Dark Side, right?
Using the Dark Side doesn't make one a Sith. The Sith were wiped out, anyway.
So there couldn't be more?
Well, the Sith followed the Rule of Two, meaning that there could only be two Sith at one time.
Yeah, well, maybe Darth Vader had a secret apprentice or something, so there were actually more than two?
That's unlikely, and even if go ahead and say Snoke was Vader's apprentice even then he probably wasn't a fully trained Sith.
So, he wouldn't be considered a Sith, and so Kylo Ren wouldn't either, even Snoke had some Sith training?
Yeah, even being trained by a Sith Lord isn't enough to be considered one. It's a whole thing, really.
