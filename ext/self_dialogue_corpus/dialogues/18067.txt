The KC music scene is great!
Oh yeah?
Yeah, the rap scene in particular is really cool.
I can't recall who they would be.
Well for starters you got Tech N9ne.
Oh yeah I like that guy.
Have you heard of Mac Lethal?
No, who is he?
He was an old emcee on rhymesayers right?
Oh yeah.
But lately he's doing youtube raps like the pancake rap.
I heard about that one.
Those guys are the big names but there's little ones too.
Such as?
Indyground Crew.
I have never heard of them.
They're worth checking out my man.
Do you have a cd of them I could borrow.
For sure, here take this.
Thanks!
