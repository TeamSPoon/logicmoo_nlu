Have you seen the movie Horrible Bosses?
I have not. What is it about?
It is about three regular everyday men who hate their bosses so much they plot to kill them.
Wow, that movie sounds intense!
No, it is actually a comedy.
Oh really! Who's in it?
It has so many good actors in it. The bosses are Jennifer Aniston, Kevin Spacey, and Collin Farrell.
Oh wow that is a good cast. Anybody else I might know?
Jamie Foxx is also in it.
Nice, is he one of of the three main characters?
No he actually is a criminal that they hire to give them advice on how to get away with murder. He is hilarious in the movie.
Sounds like a good movie. I will have watch it soon.
Yea you should. There is a second movie too called Horrible Bosses 2.
How is that one?
It is also very funny.
Great! Maybe I will watch both of them then.
You should! The first one is funnier but they are both great.
Thanks for the suggestion. I love a good comedy.
Me too, it is my favorite genre of movie.
Oh, definitely.
