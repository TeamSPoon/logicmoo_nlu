Do you like Reba McEntyre
Oh she is great.
She has song great songs like Turn on the Radio.
Yea that is a good one, I like the story it tells in it.
Me too.
She has had a lot of top hits.
I liked the song How Blue from the My KInd Of Country album.
You know she has put out a lot of albums!!
Yes, five went gold.
I heard she sold over 33.5 million dollars of albums.
Well that is because she is probably the greatest country singer of our time.
Yes and she also is an actress.
Right, but her music is what keeps her on the charts.
That is true.
Did you knew that she was born in 1955 in Oklahoma?
No I did not. But I know her husband was her manager.
Yes , and her first album came out in 1975.
She sure is a talented singer.
Definitely is.
Loved by Millions, wish I could sing like that.
