I wonder what movie Josh picked for tonight?
Well, what sort of things does he usually bring.
It's been a mix. Last time it was the remake of The Italian Job.
I don't think I've seen that.
There are a lot of mini-coopers. You'd remember it if you had.
Hmm. Okay. So it could be a heist.
Maybe. But then the time before, he brought The Notebook.
The Notebook?!
He absolutely loves that movie. He just likes chick flicks in general.
Really?
Yeah. Last time he had to fight to get to watch Steel Magnolias.
I mean. Steel Magnolias is a fun movie.
It's fun and then it's sad.
So it really could be anything that he'll bring.
I hope it's something fun. I could use a laugh today.
Well, I could bring a backup?
What did you have in mind?
Maybe Galaxy Quest? With Tim Allen and Alan Rickman?
I'd love that!
I'll pack it, just in case.
