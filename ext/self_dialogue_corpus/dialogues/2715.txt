What is your favorite pro football team?
My team is the Miami Dolphins.
Wow, that is not a very popular or good team, what is your allegiance to them?
I grew up in south Florida, so it is my home team.  What is your favorite team?
I am a DC native, so naturally I am a Washington Redskins fan.
How do you feel about the name controversy, is Redskins an offensive name or not?
I think it is fine, it is a name, not a ridicule.
What are your thoughts about coach Jay Gruden?  Do you think he can turn that team into a winning one?
Redskins have had a rough go for many years.  I do not think Gruden, or RG3, or anyone person can fix that.
I feel you, same with Dolphins, we cannot go back to the good ole days of Schula or Marino.
Who do you think will make it to the playoffs this year?
I am favoring Sea Hawks and Broncos myself.
I too favor the sea hawks for the superbowl.
As long as it is not the Bills, the Cowboys or the Patriots, I will be happy!
Outside of the Redskins, I really do not care who goes.
You do not have a major rival you don't want to see in there?
I guess I would agree with you about the Cowboys and Patriots, but who cares about the Bills?
Buffalo is definetly a Miami Rival, although I do not think they have any chance of making it to the playoffs.
Well, I would really Like to see Redskins and Dolphins make it this year, that would be the miracle of the football season.
Yeah, I won't hold my breath.  Probably Patriots and Falcons again...
