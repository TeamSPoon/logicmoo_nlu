Did you like that playoff matchup between the Celtics and Wizards last night?
Yeah, it was ok, but I wish it would have come down to a buzz beater.  I like the extra drama of a last second shot.
That definitely would have made it better, but did you see that dunk by Wall?
Oh yeah! It was awesome! It looked like it floated through air for five minutes.
I expected the Celtics to shoot better from behind the arc, did you notice that poor shooting?
I did.  I thought the same, since they shot so well during the regular season.  I think Thomas might be slightly hurt though.
He may have been, but why is shooting that many threes when he didn't make a single one?  I thought he should have been driving and slashing more, to create open shots for his teammates.
That's a good question.  He does seem to get focused on his own scoring too much.
How do you think this series turns out now?
I think they'll end up going to seven games.  Neither team seems to be able to win on the road.
