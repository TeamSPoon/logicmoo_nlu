How have you been doing today?
I'm doing fine, just a little bored.
Me to. Do you want to watch a movie?
That sounds great. Do you have any suggestions?
I have a lot of movies. What are you in the mood for?
To be honest I would like to watch something funny with a lot of action.
I sure have a few that fit that description.
Great! Do you have any with Dwayne Johnson?
Actually yes. Have you ever seen Central Intelligence?
I'm not sure. Is that an old one?
No not really. It came out a couple of years ago.
Who all is in it besides Dwayne Johnson?
Kevin Hart costars with him in it and he is hilarious.
I love Kevin Hart! He is very funny.
I like him a lot as well. He is very funny in this movie.
He was awesome in the Ride Along movies with Ice Cube.
Yeah those movies were awesome.
Pretty much anything Hart is in you can count on some laughs.
You're right about that. He reminds me of Eddie Murphy.
That is definitely a great comparison. Let's get this movie going!
