I'm pretty sure Voldemort has some nice qualities to him.
You're insane.
Hear me out.  He had a bad childhood, right?
Right.
He was an orphan, right?
Right.
Well, Harry was the same way so why does he get a free pass?
Because Harry was never evil at heart.
But maybe Voldemort wasn't either when he was very young.
Well, Voldemort's dead, so end of discussion.
