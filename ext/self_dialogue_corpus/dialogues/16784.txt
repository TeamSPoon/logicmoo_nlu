The 1975 are a great band.
I haven't heard of them.
They're British, very retro 80s sound.
Sounds like my cup of tea.
Yeah, you should listen to their most recent album.
What is it called?
I Like It When You Sleep, for You Are So Beautiful yet So Unaware of It.
That's a mouthful!
It is. The album is pretty long, too, but I really enjoy it.
How long is it?
73 minutes or something, but 73 minutes of awesomeness.
So can you tell me more about their sound?
Well, lots of 80s influence, synthpop, some songs remind me of INXS.
I'll have to give it a listen.
Yeah, definitely. I'd like to see them live.
Well, maybe if I dig them too, we could see a show together.
That would be great.
Are they playing anywhere nearby?
They are actually going to be in New York City next week!
Well, let's just get tickets!
