You know what I think is needed?
What? I can't wait for this one
A new scoring play
Um... What?
A new scoring play. We score how? a field goal or a TD right?
And a safety, and a fair catch kick, oh, and a PAT, but yes. What about?
Yes those too, but we need to allow the QB to throw the ball into the goal.
That' the dumbest idea ever. There is no way NFL owners will go for that.
Not with that kind of attitude.
Not with any kind of attitude, besides, just about all the QBs would be able to make that probably from 100 yards away.
We can make it difficult by putting a net in front of the goal so that you have to throw it into a designated area with a hole in it to go through
That's even dumber that just pitching it into the goal!
Why are you so negative?
I am realistic. Not negative.
I think it's a great idea. it shoul dbe worth 5 points, so if you're down by 5 points after your team makes the FG, then you tie the game and go to overtime
Oh, wait, what? No... There is no way more overtime is welcomed in the NFL. Guys are too old.
But it makes for a better entertainment
But entertainment isn't the issue, players need to rest. They're in their late 20s and 30s. They can't play for overtime constantly. That's why we have sudden death
Sudden death is the dumbest idea ever. They should abolish that.
I don't even know what to tell you.
