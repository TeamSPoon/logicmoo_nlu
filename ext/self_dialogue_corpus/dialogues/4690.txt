How in the world are the Minnesota Twins leading the AL Central
Yeah this is a great surprise to me too.
Right now they have been road warriors. They have one of the best road records in baseball.
Yeah they have won 11 and lost 5 on the road so far.
Not bad. Not bad at all. This is what has allowed them to be in first place.
Yeah, but they shouldn't be jumping for joy because they are only .500 at home.
Indeed. They are also only one game ahead of the Tigers and Indians.
Yeah those teams are right on their heels. No time to sleep.
For sure, this maybe a battle all the way to the end of the season between these teams.
Yeah, but I have to believe that the Cleveland Indians may be the best team in this division.
These guys were really close to winning it all last year. People have forgotten that quickly
I agree with you. This is a dangerous team that is not getting the respect that they deserve.
Yeah I think they will overtake the Twins in no time.
The Twins are just not good enough to sustain this division over 162 games.
However, if they keep playing this well on the road and begin to hit at home anything is possible.
Yeah, but that is a lot of "ifs". I just don't see it happening.
It would be a really cool story though if they could pull it off.
Well don't hold your breath because the Twins are going down.
Sometimes baseball is funny and the best team doesn't always win.
I couldn't have said it better myself.
