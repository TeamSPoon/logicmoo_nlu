So do you like Horror movies?
I do every once in a while, have any suggestions?
I love Cabin in the Woods, it was so good.
What is so good about it?
It just turns the whole horror movie trope on its head.
So is it even a horror movie?
Oh yes, it is scary, but it also is very self aware of itself.
I love those type of movies, who is in it?
No one really big, except for Thor himself, Christ Hemsworth!
Thor in a horror movie! I am sold now.
