The new Star Wars movie comes out this year.
Yeah I'm looking forward to that.
Me too. I hope Luke is in the movie more this time.
I think he will be. I just hope they don't kill him off like they did with Han.
That would suck. I don't want to see Luke get killed.
Same. I want to see how strong he is now. Hope he gets a have a lightsaber battle.
Oh I'm sure he will have at least one saber battle in the movie.
Maybe Luke and Rey will team up to fight Snoke.
I don't think we'll see Snoke fight until the 3rd movie.
Yeah you're probably right..
