Do you like Star Wars?
Which version do you mean?
To me there's only one version, the original.
Well I've seen the ones that just came out, how about you?
Those are phony. The ones from the eighties are the best.
You mean the original and then like The Empire Strikes Back?
The first three, including those two and Return of the Jedi.
Yeah, I think Yoda was the coolest.
The ones after the first three I think they were just doing too much.
Yeah, who does a trilogy prequel? Doesn't make sense to me.
