What hip hop artists do you miss hearing about?
I guess probably Nas and sometimes Eve.
Nas is amazing and he is just legendary. I heard he is dating Nicki Minaj.
How cool would it be if they released a track together?
That would be fire for sure.
I would be one of the first ones downloading it on iTunes. They would be the perfect hip hop and singing duo.
I know! Speaking of Eve, has she been up to anything musically lately?
I haven't heard anything lately, but I still jam out to her oldies sometimes in the car!
So do I! What about Ja Rule, do you miss him?
I don't honestly miss him at all. Maybe sometimes when he was teamed up with Ashanti.
Yeah, I still listen to their old song, "Mesmerized".
So do I! I like the, "Always on Time" one as well.
Me too. I don't know if he has released any new solos lately.
I'm not sure. He did have a reality show out.
Yeah, but as far as musically, I think he has mostly retired.
Some new up and coming artists are wonderful enough to keep my attention, though. Like Post Malone.
I really love him! He's so unique and raps about things with meanings.
I love how his lyrics are deep, and he is just so individualistic.
I agree. I also like Future as far as new hip hop.
As do I, though I think he has been slacking a bit lately.
