Hey you see the Cubs at the Reds the other night?
I didn't, but I can imagine how that one turned out...
7-5 Cubs baby! What it is that you like about Cincinatti again?
Well it's not their starting pitchers, that's for sure
Joey Votto still drawing the big bucks?
Yeah, but is he turning out the numbers?
Eleven homers so far this year, not the worst.
Yeah but I'd like to see more.  Cozart on the other hand...
Yeah, there you go.  Batting what like .400 these days?
Eh, more like .350.  But I got no complaints.
So what do you like best about the team?
The bullpen, these days.  Those guys are all that's saving that pitching staff
Like who are you thinking of?
Iglesias, Brice, Peralta.  Those guys can hold a close game if they're given the chance
But starting wise?
They can't keep an ERA under 4.0.  Which is no way to win games
Arroyo?
He gets the strikeouts, but if you give a hitter a piece of that slow moving train...
Its outta the park.
That's what I'm sayin.  Forget the Reds, I don't wanna get bummed out here. You wanna go get a beer?
