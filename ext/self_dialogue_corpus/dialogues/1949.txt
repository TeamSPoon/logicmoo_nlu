Do you want to watch some NFL this weekend?
Sure, I usually do anyway.
What game are you going to watch?
I'm not sure yet, do you have a preference?
Not really just some good smash mouth games.
I love those games.
Me too that's why I watch.
I think any of them will be good.
Do you think there will be any new teams added to the league soon?
I don't think soon.
What about in the next fifteen years?
I think so a few new teams will be added.
Think they will ever do a female NFL league?
I hope so but it's doubtful.
Yeah, I don't think the public would like it much.
Yeah, publicity could be a concern.
Who do you think will win the superbowl?
Indianapolis Colts.
That's surprising why?
Andrew Luck is going to explode.
