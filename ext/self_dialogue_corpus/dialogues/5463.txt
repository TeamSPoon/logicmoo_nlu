Have you seen the new Beauty and the Beast movie?
No, I haven't but heard it was great.
Yes, and the movie received some great reviews.
I heard it won many awards too, especially overseas.
Didn't the Harry Potter character played as Belle in Beauty and the Beast?
Yes, I believe her name is Emma Watson.
She was great and I didn't knew she could sing.
Emma Watson had a great voice in the movie.  She sounded so pure.
Who played her father and the Beast?
I think Dan Evans played the Beast and Kevin Klein played her father.  Both were great as well.
