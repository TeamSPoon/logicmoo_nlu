I'm a bit late to the party, but I finally heard that What Does the Fox Say song today.
Dude, that came out four years ago.
I know.  I somehow made it this long with never hearing the whole actual song.
So you've just heard bits and pieces over the years?
Right.  I never actually searched and listened to the song.
Makes sense.  So what did you think?
Kind of a funny song in terms of it's supposed to be ridiculous.
Correct, they didn't take themselves seriously in making it.
Which helps.  I'm okay if it's supposed to be stupid.
The guy who made it is a comedy artist overseas somewhere.
It's kind of funny how it became a phenomenon.
That's kind of normal for things like that, Gangnam Style, etc.
Wow, I totally forget about Gangnam Style!
Another gem for sure.  Most viewed video ever apparently on Youtube.
And do you remember Harlem Shake?
Yes, I hated those videos though.
Why's that?
Just got boring with everyone making their own versions of that crappy song.
Yeah, when everybody does it, it becomes uncool.
Indeed.  My daughter still loves all these songs though.
