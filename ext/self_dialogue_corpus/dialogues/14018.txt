Do you like lady gaga?
Yes a ton, doesn't everyone?
Well I do. My brother's wife hates her.
What, why? That seems crazy to me.
Ya hard to figure out. But she even banned lady gaga music at her wedding even!
What? That is too bad. Lady Gaga is great dance music.
Tell me about it. It was very upsetting to me. Poker face was at it's height of popularity at the time.
Also Just dance was popular during the poker face days as well.
Exactly we just wanted TO dance to the big hits of the day. But denied big time.
Does she still dislike her? She has come out with so many great songs since then, telephone, bad romance.
