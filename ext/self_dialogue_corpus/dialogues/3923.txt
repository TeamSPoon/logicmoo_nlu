What are you watching?
Misery.
Oh, one of my favourites! Let me know how you think it is compared to the book.
I've never actually read the book. Not a big Stephen King fan.
But you like the movies?
Yeah, I just meant I'm not a fan of his books. I like the movie adaptations just fine.
I gotcha. I thought the book was great, though this is probably the only instance where I thought the movie was just as good.
Ah, good to know. Is there anything I should know from the book?
Not really? I mean, it's more detailed of course but there's nothing major that comes to mind.
Okay. Plus, the book doesn't have Kathy Bates in it and I like her in this.
