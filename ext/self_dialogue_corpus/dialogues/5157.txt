Do you know that The Lion King was essentially Hamlet right?
Was it now? I did not know that.
Oh yes. The plot points and character development are basically identical.
How do you mean?
Well, Mustafa is killed by his brother Scar, just like in Hamlet.
Okay, and so Simba was the Hamlet figure?
That's right. It's a coming of age and revenge story for him.
But the ending was a little less bleak, right?
Ha! Yes, the bad guy dies in the end and everyone lives happily ever after.
Well, I suppose that's only appropriate for Disney.
