Have you seen Aladdin?
Of course I have! It is my favorite!
Who is your favorite character?
I like Jasmine. She is a role model for young women.
I like the Genie. I am glad he was finally set free.
It was the least Aladdin could do for his pal.
What was the monkey's name?
Abu! He was a little thief!
He was a cute monkey. I want a monkey.
You are not Aladdin!
