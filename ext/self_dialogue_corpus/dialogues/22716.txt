You see that new show get out
No what is it about
It's about these young black boy and his white girlfriend and they spend a week at their parents cabin
Sounds like a horror movie to me
Yeah it's more of a drama / horror
Anybody famous playing it
Not really but you know that guy Jordan pill he directs it
Why isn't Jordan pill more of a strictly comedy guy
Yeah he does the mostly common I guess he wanted to change his scenery
I mean if a comedy guys doing a drama horror movie then it can't be that good
Not real talk you got to check this one out it's a pretty good story line behind it
Well I'll check out the trailers before I actually watch the movie
So where did you see it at
I seen it at home I was going to go watch it in theaters but I'm more watching like action movies in the theaters
Yeah I hear you mostly action movie looks better than theaters I don't like drama in theaters
What horror movies are pretty fun in theaters specially how loud it sounds
Yeah I like her too but mainly I tried to stick the comedy
So what made you want me to watch this movie
No I think it's something you might relate to
Why because I have a white girlfriend
