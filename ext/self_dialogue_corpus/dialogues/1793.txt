Who is the greatest team in NFL history?
That's easy, the '72 Miami Dolphins.
Oh come on, really?
Yea, a perfect season warrants that I think.
That was so long ago and its almost happened a few times.
Almost doesn't count, ask Tom Brady if 18-1 is the same as 19-0.
The '72 Dolphins didn't win 18 games, they won 17.
Yea, but they went perfect through the regular season and the post season.
I don't think that makes them the best team ever though.
Why not, who else was better?
Well the 18-1 Patriots for one.
Obviously not, they couldn't win the big one.
I still think they had a better team, maybe not a better season.
Doesn't that translate directly into team?
Not necessarily, do you think the Dan Marino led Dolphins were a good team?
Of course I do, Dan the man baby!
And they never won a superbowl did they?
No they did not.
My point exactly.
I see what you did there.
