would you be interested in a disney movie party?
oh yikes. it definitely depends on the movie!
what kind of disney movies do you like? i have them all
something with a stellar soundtrack!
what about hercules?
oh gosh, that's a classic. i could be down for some hercules.
101 dalmatians?
yeah, not quite my thing.
i guess we'll stick with hercules, then
and that's the gospel truth!
