Is Adam Sandler the funniest comedian of all time?
No he had a couple good movies 20 years ago.
Right but most comics dont go on that long
Sure they do
Like who?
Will Ferrell has had way more funnier movies
I think Billy Madison was the funniest comedy ever
Thats being a little crazy!
Why? The one liners were great
They were but not greatest of all time
