You've seen the original Mad Max, right?
Sure I have.
Do you recall ever seeing the poster for it, of the cop wearing a helmet walking down the road carrying a gun?
Sure, I guess.
That isn't even Mel Gibson, that's the guy who played Goose.
How could anybody tell that?
Goose's helmet was a little different from the other cops, and he's the only one who wore knee and elbow pads.
But I guess since the helmet visor is down, you couldn't tell.
The guy who played Goose was a roommate of Mel Gibson's in film school.
That's cool.
They wanted to use unknown actors, but they still wanted to go for a strong worldwide audience.
They certainly got that.
I didn't know until recently that all of the actors were dubbed until a DVD release not very long ago.
Why did they dub them?
At the time, Americans weren't very much exposed to the Australian accent and couldn't understand it.
I never realized it was dubbed.
I know, it's amazing to realize that you've been fooled all these years!
I heard the movie wasn't originally shown in New Zealand and then was given the harshest rating for violence.
Why? They don't really show much violence. It's implied
Apparently an officer in New Zealand was murdered by bikers in a somehow similar manner as Goose is murdered. So they thought it would be distasteful.
