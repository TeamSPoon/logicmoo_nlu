Have you seen any of the Fast and Furious movies?
No.  I have never seen any of them.
What?  None of them?
Nope.
I can't believe it.
Are they any good?
Are they any good?  Yes!  I love them all.
Maybe I will have to watch them.
Yes.  I think that you will enjoy them.
Who all is now in them?
Well you know Paul Walker died.
I did. That was sad.
It was.  The movies are not the same without him.
So who else besides Vin Diesel is in the movies?
Well they brought in The Rock and Jason Statham.
I like both of those guys.
It made them better by bringing in those two.  Charlise Theron was also in the last one.
I like her.
Me too.
I think I will start watching these.
