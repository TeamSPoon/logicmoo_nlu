Have you seen all of the Star Wars movies?
You mean the brand new, the newer, and the old?
Yes. Have you seen them?
Yes I have. Have you?
I have. Who is your favorite character?
I like Han. He is such a complex character.
So do I. He is hard to figure out.
I know, you can't really tell where he stands for so long.
Of course I love his companion Chewie as well.
Oh, who wouldn't love that guy?!
