Have you seen the Get Out movie?
No I haven't seen it yet. Did you like it?
Yes it was awesome!
I guess I'll go see it. What's it about again?
A guy goes to visit his girlfriend's parents and it ends up really bad.
Ok. I see you're not giving up many details. Who's in it?
No one that I've recognized before.
Ok. who's the director?
Jordan Peele from Key and Peele.
Is it scary?
More of a suspense movie than a thriller.
Is it a long movie?
Not at all. The typical hour and a half movie.
Would you say it's like any other movie you've seen.
No, it's nothing like I've ever seen before.
How did this movie do in the box office?
It did really well, actually. One of the highest grossing in a while.
Oh wow. That's great.
Just check it and let me know what you think.
Okay. I will.
