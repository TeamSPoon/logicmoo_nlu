Look at this awesome scarf! It's leopard print and supr soft.
That is cute. You should buy it.
I love the scarf look. I wear them all the time.
I don't but I've noticed how good they look on you.
Here's another one. Which is better?
Get both. They're on sale.
This one has clovers on it and I love that. I think I will get both.
Do you ever wear them on your hair?
No, but do you think I'd look good.
I do actually but it has to be the right kind of scarf.
True. Do you see any that would work.
I think maybe this red one. It's the right kind anyway.
How about this orange one?
Yes and it's a better color. Get it.
I already have the other two.
You'll look so cute, though.
OK. How can I resist that?
You can't. Now let's go before we find even more.
We should. I love buying accessories.
Me too. I have so many.
