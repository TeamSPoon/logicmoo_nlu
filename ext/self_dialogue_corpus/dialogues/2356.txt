Let's see, remember when the Packers were in the last Super Bowl
Yes, it was Super Bowl XLV (or 45, I think). Played Feb 6 2011.
Yes, and the Packers won, correct?
Yes they did, score was 31 to 25, it was a close game
Yes and remember when Troy Palamalu did all those hair commercials. Women would kill for hair like that.
Oh yes, I do remember that. Wasn't it for head and shoulders.
yes I do remember it was. We were all comparing his hair to Clay Matthews, but I think Tory won hands down.
I agree. That was some year.
Yes, I remember all the parody songs they came up with. Some were pretty funny.
Yup, I remember the parody of Black and Yellow for the Steelers.
I remember that one also. You know, I can't remember who did the half time show
I believe it was the Black Eyed Peas
Oh yes, I love them, I'll have to you tube it to remember.
Speaking of super bowls, we went to Lambeau Field and bought a DVD of the Ice Bowl game between Packers and Cowboys.
Really, would love to borrow it some time
Sure, but we haven't even watched it yet.
Lombardi, the King of all coaches.
you got that right "Winning isn't everything, it's the only thing"
He was a hero.
Yes he was
