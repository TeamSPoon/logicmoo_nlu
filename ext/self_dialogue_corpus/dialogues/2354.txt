Will Alshon Jeffrey have a good year this year?
I mean hes not getting passes from Jay Cutler for once.
But he seems to not be able to keep his body healthy
Thats the best ability in the NFL, availability.
I think he can post career numbers with Wentz throwing to him.
But do we know how good Wentz is?
He showed promise last year.
Plus Jeffrey always had a good back to take off pressure.
Forte was barely used in Chicago
There was always the threat of it though.
Yeah true, I guess you could say he was aided.
Why would he have signed a one year deal after playing on a one year deal?
The market dictates that nowadays.
So you think he couldnt have gotten a better deal anywhere?
No I think it would have been too tough.
Someone surely would have given him multiple  years
Look at Terrelle Pryor.
What about him?
He also got a one year deal
Maybe this is how teams deal with free agents going forward
