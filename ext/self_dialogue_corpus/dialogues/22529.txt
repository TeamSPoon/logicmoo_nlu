Remember JAWS?
That was scary.
The sound before he attacked.
That was scary also.
It was released in 1975.
The movie poster is great.
It is simple.
The girl is swimming.
And JAWS is underwater.
It is a thriller film.
Directed by Steven Speilburg.
He is the best.
There are many actors in it.
Roy Scheider is in it.
Also Robert Shaw is in it.
Richard Dreyfuss is in it.
I like Lorraine Gray.
It had a $9 million budget.
It made $470 million.
There were some sequels.
