Have you seen the movie a Dog's Purpose?
Yes I have. It was a great movie
I was so happy to see a Pembroke Welsh Corgi in it.
Which dog was that?
Tino the short long red and white dog.
I really liked Bailey. I cried so hard when he passed away. Did you?
I was grabbing tissues every time one of the dog's died.
What was your favorite part?
I liked it when the dog at the end gets the attention of his owner with the football to make him know I am Bailey reincarnated
I really like Ryan O'Neil in this movie. He is a great actor.
Yes he is. Who is the actress who played her girlfriend?
Britt Robertson she was in the Dome tv show.
It is too bad that the movie didn't do well in theaters because they thought there was animal abuse. Do you agree?
Yes that rumor really hurt the movie in theaters but word of mouth is all been positive those who have seen it.
What part did you find the saddest in the movie?
When Bailey is dying and he goes is that you Ethan? Are you there? I was balling thinking of all the dogs I have lost.
Yes I had a box of tissues next to me the whole time
I thought the whole movie was well written. It had a positive message.
Do you want to watch it over at my house again tonight?
Sure be sure to have the tissues ready.
