You are too young to remember the Beatles, but they are one of the greatest musicians/song writers of the modern world.
Right, but I do know many of their songs and like to listen to them.
What are some of your favorites?
I really like the quirkiness of Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club album.
Yes, it was a unique album and very popular.
"Lucy in the Skies With Diamonds" is really fun to listen too.
Also, on the album is "When I'm Sixty Four".  As I have hit the 60s, I appreciate that song even more.
Do you think the Beatles were on their way out with this album?
I actually think it increased their popularity. It showed the world how versatile they were.
They did one more album after that, "Let It Be".  That's the one that seems to be their "goodbye" album. "The Long and Winding Road" kind of sums up their career.
