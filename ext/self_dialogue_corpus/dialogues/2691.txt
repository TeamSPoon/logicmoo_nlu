Hey did you know football season is coming up?
Yeah, I can't wait for it!
Who is your favorite NFL team?
I like the Atlanta Falcons, they are a good team!
I also like the Atlanta Falcons but my favorite team is Tampa Bay Buccaneers.
I like the bucs a lot as well. I think John Gruden was their best coach.
I agree. He was the best by far.
What do you think of the Patriots?
I'm sick of seeing the always win. I want my team to get to the super bowl.
Yeah but maybe the reason they always win is because they are very good.
That could be why, but Id still like my team to have a chance at winning a superbowl.
Yes I agree. I too would like an under dog team to win it this year.
I hope that this season is full of twists and turns and exciting plays.
Oh im sure it will be exciting.
Yes but, I mean REALLY exciting. Like record breakers.
Oh I see what you mean. Yes that would be cool.
Do you know the farthest fieldgoal in the NFL history?
No, I do not.
Well I sure hope my team does good this season.
I hope both our teams do well!
