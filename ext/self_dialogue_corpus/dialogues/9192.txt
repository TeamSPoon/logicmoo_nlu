Do you like Kings of Leon?
Absolutely. Sex on Fire is a great song.
Did you know that they are from Nashville?
I did not. Are they inspired by country music?
I have read that they are. Though they prefer rock music it sounds like.
They write some excellent guitar riffs. I certainly believe it.
My favorite song by them is Use Somebody
I love that one too!
Their last album was fantastic. Walls was a great song.
I really liked the album too. That was my favorite track on it.
