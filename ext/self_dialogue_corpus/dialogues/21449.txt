Have you watched A Cure for Wellness?
No, I haven't seen it.
Oh, welll you really should. It was awesome.
I'm afraid it'll be too scarry.
I thought the same thing but it's really not too spooky.
Oh okay, what was the creepiest part?
Well I don't want to spoil it but there's this part where he's in a tank with eels that creeped me out.
Oh okay, that doesn't sound too bad.
Nah, not awful. Just had a pretty dark feel to the whole movie though.
What was the best part of it?
Oh there was this girl in the movie and she was really mysterious and interesting.
Cool, did it have a good ending too?
Yeah, I really wasn't expecting it.
Good, I like unexpected stuff.
Yeah, that's my favorite part when movies send me on a loop.
Well don't tell me any more about it, I'll just have to watch it.
Yeah, you should, you'll like it.
I'm sure I will.
Let me know what you thought about it.
Okay, I will.
