What's your favorite rock group?
That would definitely be The Red Hot Chili Peppers.
Oh yeah? What do you like most about them?
I love the way they fuse different styles and how much energy they have. And Anthony Kiedis has a great voice.
Have you ever seen them in concert before?
I did see them in San Antonio, Tx in 2005. They were on the Stadium Arcadium tour.
Had you ever been to a rock concert before then?
That was my first and last rock concert so far.
That sounds awesome. I bet you had a great time.
I really did, singing to the top of my lungs. What's your favorite rock group?
Definitely The White Stripes.
Oh I love them. Jack White is a fantastic drummer.
He is. Have you ever seen their concert movie Under the Great White Northern Lights?
No I haven't. Is it any good?
It was very tastefully done and it features their tour in Canada.
That's awesome. Seven Nation Army is a classic to this day and always will be.
Yes their sound is so unique and you can't help but to bob your head along to it.
I also like classic rock groups like Led Zeppelin.
Me too. Along with Black Sabbath and Pink Floyd their one of my favorite classic rock bands.
Ozzy Osbourne used to have a reality show with his family and it was hilarious.
