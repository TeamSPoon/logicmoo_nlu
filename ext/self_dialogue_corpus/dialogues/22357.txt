I think bruce lee made some good movies
He for sure made some amazing movies .
What is your favorite of his?
My favorite is enter the dragon
I wish he made more movies
Yeah i feel the same to be honest
Such a shame he had passed at such a time
He pretty much died for the thing he loved though
I guess that is a way to look at it.
He did die during a movie set
Well that is true so i guess your saying would be right
It is right because he loved film
But he also loved martial arts
i am sure he loved martial arts and film was nowhere near as much.
He was a genius in his movies and i also liked his sons movies
His son was also quite a good actor
Most definitely he was not as good as his father though
But it would be hard to be as good as a legend
That is correct because bruce was a legend among movie stars
He for sure was.
