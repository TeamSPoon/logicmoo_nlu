Have you seen the new King Kong movie?
Which one, Skull Island?
Yea, that's the one, have you seen it?
Yeah, it's alright. Nothing special. I like the one from the early 2000s more.
The one with Jack Black?
Yeah, that one had a better story. This one just focuses on Samuel L. Jackson's character and the ending was just strange.
The one from the 2000s was really long though. I got bored of it halfway through the movie.
But the cinematics for that movie at the time were great. Skull Island looks like it was developed using a playstation 2.
Really its that bad?
Yeah, the CG in the movie is pretty bad.
So what's good about the movie?
The action scenes were pretty good and they made Kong a good character.
Oh, interesting. I like action scenes involving giants.
Yeah, and it was funny too. It had that guy from Step Brothers with Will Farrel.
Oh, John C. Reilly. I like that guy, he's funny.
Yeah, he was pretty funny in the movie.
Any other actors in there?
Tom Hiddleston. He's good as usual but nothing spectcular.
He's the one in the Avengers right?
Yeah, Loki.
