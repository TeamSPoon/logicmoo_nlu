What did you think of the Hobbit and Lord of the Rings movies?
Oh are those somehow related?
Yes. You know they are.
Oh I'm just confused because LOTR was three books and three movies. But the Hobbit is one book and three movies. Confusing.
Yeah I don't know what they were thinking with that.
They were thinking about money.
Probably. How did you like them though?
I liked the Lord of the Rings to an extent. But there were some issues.
What issues did you have? I loved it.
Well there was a lot missing from the books.
It's hard to put everything from a book in to a feature length movie.
The extended versions are way longer than feature length and they added very little to the movie.
Even still, there probably wasn't enough time to do everything.
Then why did they have like forty minutes of that love nonsense between Aragorn and Arwen?
Ok I get your point. What was your issue with the Hobbit besides it being three movies?
That was the basis for why it was bad. It was so long that it was just boring.
So one series was too long and the other wasn't long enough?
Yep. Pretty much.
You're hard to please.
I just know what I like.
