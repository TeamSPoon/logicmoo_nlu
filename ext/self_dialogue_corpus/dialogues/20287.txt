Have you ever seen Running Scared?
Is it a new movie?
No, it is from the mid 2000's I believe.
Who stars in it?
Paul Walker plays the star.
Oh, what is it about?
It focuses on one night, and a gun that gets in the wrong hands and the events that unfold through the night.
I think I have heard of it before actually.
Yeah, the neighbor kid found the gun and the search for him is what the movie is about.
Paul was a great actor, I have to see it now.
It is a great action movie, the cinematography is really good too.
Is it scary?
No, it is action, not horror or thriller.
Who else plays in it?
I am unsure of names, but the other actors are recognizable.
Is the ending good?
The ending is the best part, you would never guess how it ends.
I will have to see it real soon.
You will not be disappointed, great movie.
I am going to check it out as soon as possible.
