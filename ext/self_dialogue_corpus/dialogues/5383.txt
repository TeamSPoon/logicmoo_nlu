Wall-E was a pretty underrated movie.
In some ways.  I like how there was little dialogue.
The part on Earth was much better than the spaceship.
I disagree.  I kind of liked how man because lazy.
It got a bit too preachy though.  It was better when he was picking up trash.
It was a cautionary tale for man though.
You're reading too much into it.
No I'm not.  Man got lazy, machines did everything for us kind of like how things are going today.
Be lazy and get fat eating food?  I'm in.
You're missing the point.
