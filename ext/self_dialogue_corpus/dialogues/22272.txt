Do you like Dirty Dancing?
The act of dirty dancing or the movie?
Haha! The movie.
Yes, I love it! It's one of my favorites.
Did you know they made a television remake of it?
Get out of here! Are you serious?
Yes, it was on last night and everyone hated it.
Why on earth would they remake that film? Especially a tv remake?
I don't know, but it was bad!
Who played the leads?
Abigail Breslin played Baby and the guy from Pink's Try video played Johnny.
Oh he's cute! Abigail Breslin??
Yeah, I adore her,, but this was not the role for her.
I can't imagine her in that part. How was Johnny?
He danced well, bit he was no Patrick Swayze and the changes to the film didn't help.
I can't decide if I should watch it or not.
It kind of made me angry to be honest, but maybe you should watch for yourself.
Was it the same plot line?
Well they butchered the ending, but a lot was the same.
Oh no! I loved the original ending.
