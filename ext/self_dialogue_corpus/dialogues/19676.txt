Have you heard of C418?
That's a weird name, and no I have not heard of them.
Well, you know what Minecraft is right?
Of course, though I don't play at all.
That's ok. Anyways, it's the guy who does the music for Minecraft.
Is it any good?
Yeah and he has other stuff too that isn't really Minecraft music, which is cool.
That's neat.
Most of it is really good too, you should listen to some of it.
What is it like?
There's a lot of piano work and electronic sounds, it's very peaceful.
Oh, that's pretty different. I think I would like that.
Yeah, a lot of people I know really like it.
Like who?
My girlfriend likes it and listens to it a lot while doing homework. I do too.
It's not distracting at all?
No it's really good for background music.
What's one of their better albums?
I think I like One the most, it has the most soothing songs I think.
I'll check them out sometime, thanks.
