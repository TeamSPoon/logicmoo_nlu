Have you seen any good action movies lately?
Of course, that is my favorite genre of movies!
I am really excited about some new war action movies coming out soon.
Which ones?
Well, particularly, I am interested in Dunkirk.
That does look very good.
I am interested in the action parts, but also to learn more about the events.
I do not know too much about it, but the action parts I have seen in the previews look great.
Most World War II movies that have been made recently have great action scenes.
I would agree, did you see Fury? That was great.
