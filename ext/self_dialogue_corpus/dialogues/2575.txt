Yea, Marshawn Lynch is a Raider now. Isn't that something?
Yea, they have a team and they all seem like tough guys.
Yea, well that fits the city of Oakland, doesn't it?
It sure does and they do have a great team.
Yea, in any city, they would be good. They have some playmakers.
Yea, well they have Carr throwing to Cooper.
Yea, that already is a great start.
Yup! Add Lynch to the mix and you really have something.
Yea, well their defense isn't too bad either.
Yea, hopefully they will improve this year, but they have been okay.
I agree! They need that to go along with good quarterback play.
Yea, well with the contract that they gave Carr, they let him know that he is the leader.
Yea, I agree. Its time for them to take the next step.
I truly think that they will this year and veterans like Marshawn Lynch should help a lot.
Yea, he should. He can really run the ball.
I agree and that is something that they didn't have much of last year.
They didn't but they do now and it could be something special.
Yea, definitely. We will just have to find out as the season goes on.
Yea, it should be an interesting year.
Yea, both the AFC and NFC stack up nicely.
