What is the most tragic scene in movie history?
I am not sure... there are lots of good ones.
What about the scene at the end of Moulin Rouge where Satine dies?
Oh, that's a good one.
I especially am convinced by Christian's crying. The choked sobs were spot on.
Yeah, I know right?
I really like movies where one of the main characters gets hurt or dies, and his or her lover cries over them.
Haha that's interesting!
Yeah I think that's really what love is. I mean, you can say that you love someone, but you never know until you put it to the test.
Haha, that's what movies are for - you can live out your fantasies through the actors.
Yeah... what are your favorite movies?
I like Avatar. I like it for the music and the visuals.
You don't care much for the plot?
No, I don't, and in fact before I watch a movie, I read the entire plot summary including the ending.
Doesn't that spoil it? Why would you do that?
I need to know if it's interesting - I need to know the big picture because when I watch a movie, I focus on the details.
You're a film critic, huh?
I never voice my opinions on websites or anything... it's just for personal enjoyment.
Well, you should get a Rotten Tomatoes account.
I have one, but people would just think I'm crazy or ranting...
