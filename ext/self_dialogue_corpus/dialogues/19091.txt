Hey did you see LCD Soundsystem are playing in LA
Yes I did and I was lucky enough to get tickets during the pre-sale
Oh wow‚ that's cool - what night?
I got tickets for the Saturday night which was my preferred night
How many nights are they playing?
Five total‚ Friday through Tuesday
Where is it they're playing?
They're playing at the Paladium
I don't think I've ever been there
I have been once years ago‚ it was to see the Jesus and Mary Chain with Mazzy Star
Oh wow‚ that must of been a cool show
Yes it was‚ it was really cool to see Mazzy Star
Have you heard the new LCD Soundsystem songs?
Yeah "Call the Police" and "American Dream"
Yeah that's them‚ I like them both
Yeah‚ me too and I'm really looking forward to the new album.
I was bummed when they broke up
Yeah me too and I was also bummed I never got to see them live
Well you've got that solved now
Yeah I'm so excited
