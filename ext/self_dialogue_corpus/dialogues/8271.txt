What happened to Mariah Carey?
She is alright.
Like her career tailspinned quickly.
I dont think that happen she had a huge Christmas hit recently
All I want for Christmas is you is very old.
Well she settled down and no longer needed to perform
But then she had the incident on New Years Eve.
Yeah that was bad.
I dont know I guess she lost it one she stopped making music.
I think it shows how fake she was the entire time
