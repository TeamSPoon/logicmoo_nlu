Hey, what do you think about football?
As in the NFL?
Yea, the NFL.
I love it!
Oh?  Who's your favorite team?
All hail the Patriots!
How in all that is holy can you like that team?
Haha...
No, really.  They cheat!
Allegedly...
No, they literally cheat!
How so?
The deflated ball incident?
See, that was unproven
Still, we all know it happened!
It's just accusations at this point
....
But you must admit that they are a good team even if I give you the deflated ball incident.
Well they did win the Superbowl
Exactly!
