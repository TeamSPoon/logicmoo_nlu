Do you want to go to the Eagles game in September with me?
Sure, I'd like to go.
They are playing the Giants.
That should be a great match up.
I know, but I do miss seeing Hynoski play.
He was a standout from rookie year.
Yes, he was great.
I hope he returns to the NFL.
Me too.
Do your kids like the mascots as much as mine?
You bet!
My kids love the mascots.
Mine go just for the food and mascots.
I know.  I think they'll eventually like football, though.
What other games do you want to see?
I would like to see the Eagles play the Redskins.
That would be cool as well.
I'd like to see the Eagles beat them.
I hope the Eagles go undefeated.
That would be awesome!
