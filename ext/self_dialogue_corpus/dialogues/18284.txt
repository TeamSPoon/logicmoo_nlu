Have you heard the new Disturbed Sounds of Silence.
Yes, that was amazing.
Yeah, it even surpassed the original.
I know.  I didn't know he could sing like that.
Yeah, he's a classically trained singer.
Well it sounded great.
How often does a song surpass the original?
Not often.  Especially since Simon and Garfunkel were great.
Yeah one of the best songs either way.
I know.  Off topic but ever notice that song sounds like the plot of Harry Potter?
Yes!  I saw a youtube video about that.
I know it's super creepy now close it matches.
Tell me about it.  It's almost a perfect analog for the Snape and Harry relationship.
Yeah, either way.  But Disturbed was much deeper.
Yeah I like the energy in it.
It was like bam!  Vibrato in the high notes and everything.
Just goes to show you never judge someone.
Yeah, who would have though Disturbed has the best voice in rock.
I mean I know they are good.
But who expected the classic music chops.
