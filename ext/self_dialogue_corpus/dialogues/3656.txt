Hey, what would you say is your favorite thriller movie?
Gosh, that's a tough one. Do you mean like a psychological thriller?
Sure, or any kind.
I tend to like classics, like Alfred Hitchcock movies.
Oh sure, Psycho is a classic.
Yes, but I also like Rear Window and North by Northwest.
Those are more like mysteries or suspense movies. I tend to like psychological thrillers, like Saw, Seven, and The Shining.
Yes, I like movies that make you think.
Or ones with surprise plot twists or endings.
Oh, yes, like Bound or Unbreakable. They were great.
