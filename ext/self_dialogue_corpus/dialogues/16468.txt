Do you want to see Steel Panther with me this summer?
Haha I'd love to! I've never been.
Really?? Oh my gosh you will love them
I like the few songs I've heard.
I will have to get you caught up.
Yeah let me know what to listen to.
Really, all of their stuff is good. Do you own any of their music?
No, I've just heard some on Spotify and when I'm driving with you.
OK, listen to their albums. Feel the steel, balls out, all you can eat, and lower the bar.
Alright, I will start playing them while driving to work.when is the show?
There are a couple, so I will check. Most likely June or july.
Awesome, I'm down. How much are tickets usually?
Don't worry about that. I'm friends with the guys, so we will get guest listed. You will freak out when you meet them!
No way! I can't wait to meet them!
They are so kind and hilarious. A toned down version of their on stage personas.
That's great. What are your favorite songs?
Oh so many! 17 girls in a row, stripper girl, 10 strikes, let me cum in, wasted too much time..
Sweet I will check those out.
I will send you my top 25 to listen to
Sounds good! Thanks
