I want to have a Star Wars movie marathon.
Let's do ot.  Which one do we start eith?
I don't know.  By release date would be Star Ward.
Then Empire Strikes Back.
But what about the order on the story?
It would be Phantom Memace.
No, Rogue One came before all those.
That's right.  They paved the way.
Then after Rogue One it is Phantom Menace.
Then Attack of the Killer Clones.
