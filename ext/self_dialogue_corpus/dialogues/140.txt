Did you like Catwoman?
No, not at all.
Why not I kind of liked it?
Well I thought they did a bad job at bringing the character to the big screen.
Why?
Well they made her out to be this overly sexy character which isn't the worst thing but her character just wasn't like how she was in the comics.
I never read comics as a kid so I wouldn't know.
Well just my opinion on it though.
I keep hearing it sucked but I think it was good I liked the movie.
Glad someone did.
