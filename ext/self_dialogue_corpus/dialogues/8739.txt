I am a big fan of Tom Petty.
Me too. His lyrics are great.
Sure are! I love his new cd Hypnotic Eye.
Yea that has a lot of good songs on it.
Full Moon Fever is my all time favorite.
Yea, I love American Girl.
Years ago I called Ticketmaster for Tickets to Tom Petty. When I got them they were for Tom Jones!
Oh that is horrible.
I was really mad. I have seen him several times since then.
I have never seen him in concert.
