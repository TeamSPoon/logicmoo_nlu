Did you watch the Red Sox/Yankees game last night?
No, I missed it!
Oh that's too bad! You missed a great game.
Yes, I'm sure. It's always interesting with that rivalry.
It definitely was last night. It went into extra innings.
Oh really? How many?
They played seventeen innings.
Wow, that's a long game. What was the score going into the seventeeth?
It was zero-zero.
Oh, well then maybe not such a good game. It sounds boring.
Not at all! There were several bases loaded, no out situations, but both teams managed to get out of them.
That's tough to do. Must have been good pitching!
It was for sure.
So who finally won the game?
The Red Sox ended up winning with a walk-off home run in the bottom of the 17th.
What a way to win the game.
It really was. The ball went over the Green Monster so it couldn't have been more perfect.
What a lucky fan who managed to grab that ball!
Definitely. I wish it was me.
Me too!
