Did you ever see American Gangster?
I own the dvd.
Do you like it?
Dude, I said I own the dvd.
So I'll take that as a yes?
Yeah.
I don't like how Frank Lucas became a snitch.
I know right? Sold all that heroin and then decided to turn state's evidence.
I think Denzell did a good job in that role.
Man, Denzell can play almost any role.
You see it took him to play a crooked cop before he won an Oscar.
As long as he won it is all that matters.
I know that's right.
Have you seen his latest movie?
You talking about the one he directed?
Yeah, Fences.
I saw it.
Did you like it?
I LOVED it.
That's what's up.
