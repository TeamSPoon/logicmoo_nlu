I really love Beyoncé. She's one of my favorite artists.
Me too! Her last album was really good.
Lemonade?
Yeah, the one that came out in 2016.
I love Lemonade. I listen to it all the time.
What's your favorite song from the album?
Wow, that's a hard question. Depends on my mood, I guess.
"Formation" is an awesome song.
Yeah, I love that one!
Another great song is "Sorry".
Definitely. "Sorry" and "Formation" are both great empowerment songs.
"Freedom" is really empowering, too.
Oh, for sure. I love Kendrick Lamar's part on that one!
I also like some of the slower songs.
Agreed. Honestly, if I had to name one favorite song off Lemonade, it would probably be "All Night".
Yeah, that's a beautiful song. Another one that's really pretty is "Sandcastles".
I love that one. It's kind of melancholy, but in a good way.
That's why I like it so much. It's really vulnerable, which is a side of Beyoncé you don't get to see that often.
True. I hope she does more songs like that on future albums.
Me too.
