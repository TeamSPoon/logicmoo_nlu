What new movies come out this month?
I know that spiderman homecoming, and war for the planet of the apes are released this month
Oh ya, I love the planet of the apes series
I know, the first one was the best so far and the graphics are incredible.
Especially the orangutan!. I think my son said there is an emoji movie
really? Not sure how well that will go over, how do you make a whole movie based on emoji?
agreed, not sure I will attempt that one, I will go see spiderman for sure, those you can count on being good
whats your favorite superhero movie?
I think its the avengers, its action with humor
Oh yes, when Hulk throws Loki around is my favorite part
the theatre exploded with laughter during that part
I sometimes just look that part up on youtube for a laugh
I really enjoy the xmen movies as well
I agree, they have really been done very well. I will admit to loving childrens movies as well
Did you see BFG? I loved the giant
oh my goodness, his expressions were spot on
It was a feel good movie for sure
I hope they make a part 2
I wonder if they will?
I havent heard it discussed
