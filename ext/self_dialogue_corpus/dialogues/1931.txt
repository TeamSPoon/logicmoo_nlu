Are you looking forward to the upcoming NFL season?
In a way, yes, but over the last few years I've lost some interest in the NFL.
Why is that?  You used to be such a die hard fan for years.
The problem is the way the NFL has marketed the game on TV.
You mean with all the commercials?
That's a big part of it.  The games now go on for 3 hours or more and I tend to lose interest unless it's really tight.
I know what you mean.  Most people don't want to spend 3 hours watching a football game.
I was watching a game last year and realized that it was like 3 or 4 plays and then a series of commercials.
That's true.  And then it starts over again - a few plays and then more commercials.
When you figure that the game is only 60 minutes, not including time outs, the commercials take up way more time than the game itself.
I guess it's all about making money for the NFL and the teams.  The commercials pay the bills.
It's like a catch 22 problem for the NFL.  The bigger salaries require more commericals which allow them to pay bigger salaries which require more commercials.
Can't you just DVR the game and skip through the commercials.
I tried doing that but it's not the same experience.
You mean because you already know the outcome.
Exactly.  It's just not the same as watching it live.
So are you still going to watch some of the games?
Sure.  But I'll be selective and if the game is not interesting I just won't sit through all those commercials.
Do you know others who have given up on the NFL because of so many commercials on TV?
I do know a few but the NFL has a problem with the fan base and the solution is not easy.
