Did you see Arrival
Yes, it was interesting
Do you think it was realistic
I don't think intelligent aliens will ever visit us here
Some of it was cheesy
I noticed that the Americans were not the good guys in this
Who were the good guys
The scientists were
I remember that the Chinese were about to attack one of the ships
Yes, the Americans tried to keep the scientists from doing their job too
The message in the movie was great
What do you think the message is
I think it's that people must work together to look forward
I think people do work together
An actual scenario would still cause panic
I think people would be pretty civilized and not dare to attack them
It was nice to see friendly aliens
They were friendly but looked a bit spooky
The language they made up was interesting
The best part was when they first got them to talk
