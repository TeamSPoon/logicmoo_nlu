What is your favorite Hitchcock thriller?
I think that Rear Window is my favorite.
I think that Suspiscion is mine.
Why do you say that?
Well, I like that you never know whether or not Cary Grant is trying to kill her.
Although, since he wasn't trying to kill her, she looks like a really bad wife.
LOL!  That's true.  What do you like about Rear Window?
Well, it takes a while to figure out whether or not there was a murder.  I also think Grace Kelly does a great job.
I think she's overrated.  But, I think Thelma Ritter was great.
Thelma Ritter was great in that movie.
