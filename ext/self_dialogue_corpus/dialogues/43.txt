What is your favorite marvel movie?
Definitely Guardians of the Galaxy 2.
Yea that intro was so good!
Yea it was, that was hilarious watching Groot dance like that.
That's what I like the most about Guardians of the galaxy, it's always so funny.
Yea, they really put a lot of time into the script.
The action was top notch too, I mean everything looked so real.
Yea, its amazing what special effects can do now.
Those movies have really made me a fan of the Guardians.
Same here, I didn't even know who they were before the movie!
