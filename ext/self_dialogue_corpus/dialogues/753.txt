Where do you think the league goes from here?
In what sense?
Do you think the concussion lawsuits will make the game worse
To a degree yes but I think the game will sustain itself.
Do you think players salaries will rise as a hazard pay?
No I do not think that at all. In fact they may dip
Why do you think that
TV contracts are not going to be as expensive next time around
So how do the players thwart that?
They are going to have to give an extra 2 games a year
Why not take them off the preseason
Cause the owners wont let that happen
Then give them two byes a year.
Yeah that will take the league well into March
I would be ok with that.
So would the rest of America I am sure.
Do you think this could happen soon?
Yeah around the time the next CBA needs to be agreed.
I hope you are right
Yeah I think i am for once
