What excites you this year in the NFL?
I am excited about the Cowboys.
Me too
They have a great shot this year
I like their offense.
Their defense is good too.

Yes, but I am not sure if he can bounce back this year
It will be interesting to see what they do.
I agree
So, are they your pick?
No
Who do you like in the NFC?
The Packers
They are good
Yeah I think this is their year.
Green Bay always puts out a good team
They really do
