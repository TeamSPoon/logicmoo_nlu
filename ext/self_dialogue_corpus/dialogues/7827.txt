How many Harry Potter movies have you watched?
Five, I think. I haven't watched all of them.
Some are better than others. What would you say is the most memorable thing about all of them?
"Snape Kills Dumbledore."
I agree! Harry Potter has lots of memborable things, but that one tops all!
I particularly like the scenes where he's flying on the broom.
That one. Was that from the first movie?
Yes, I think so.
Which Harry Potter movie is your favorite?
"Harry Potter and the Sorceror's Stone."
