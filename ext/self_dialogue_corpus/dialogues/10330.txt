I want to watch an action movie that is about sports.
I have just the movie for you. Do you like foreign movies?
I do. What is this movie you speak of?
There is a movie called Shaolin Soccer that might be what you are looking for.
That sounds interesting. What happens in it?
A team of misfits goes against some corrupt people.
That sounds great. Is there anything else you can tell me about it?
They defy gravity. The stunts in this movie are insane.
I want to watch this. How do they defy gravity?
They jump hundreds of feet in the air while playing soccer.
