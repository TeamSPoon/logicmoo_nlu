How's that coffee?
Good.  It goes well with the opera I am listening to..
Opera?  How did you become interested in opera?
I saw the move "Philadelphia" with Tom Hanks and in it, his character is trying to describe what opera is like to his lawyer while listening to a cut
I remember that scene!
It moved me so much I started  to listen to opera online.
Is it very complicated, opera?
Yes and no.
What do you mean?
i like it for the emotion that it creates and evokes in the listener. So that's the "no" part of the answer to your question.
i think i understand that.
The "yes" part of the answer about opera is that it is so complicated that it's crazy
what do you mean?  Isn't the emotion just right there on the surface
yes, but opera knowledge is a very hard thing to come by.  They are usually in Italian.
i don't speak italian!
Neither do I.  And then there's the matter of all the OPINIONS about the performers, their styles, the orchestral skill and so on
so the nonemotional part of opera takes away the fun of it?
No.  If a study of opera gets to heavy or too hard, i just take out my Tosca tracks, turn them up and lose myself in the emotion
I love that.
I love it too.  It's almost not worth it to study opera.  It's more worth it to listen to it.
