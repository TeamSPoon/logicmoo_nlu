Do you like pop music?
Yeah I do. My musical tastes are pretty eclectic.
So to you, who is the reigning king of pop music?
It's still gotta be Michael Jackson.
I can understand that. I still really enjoy his music.
Me too. Forever Michael!
Then who is the Queen of Pop for you?
Well Madonna naturally!  I think the mass media still sees it this way too.
Yeah I think that's right. The reigning King and Queen.
Michael Jackson will be in our hearts.
