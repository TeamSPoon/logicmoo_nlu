I wonder what ever happened to Don Bluth.
Who?
Don Bluth, the guy responsible for movies like The Secret of NIMH and All Dogs Go to Heaven.
Is that all?
He also did An American Tail, and The Land Before Time. He was big in the '80s.
So what happened?
Well, he was originally a Disney animator who didn't like the direction the company was taking, you see?
Yeah?
So, he decided he'd make his own movies and bring back high-quality animation. He was so successful it kicked Disney back into gear, too.
If he did all that, where did he go?
The '90s came and none of his films were classics. Then he killed traditional animation.
Wait, what?
It wasn't just him, but him and Disney. They were in a competition to see who could get out their sci-fi animated film out first.
What movies were those?
Don Bluth had Titan A.E. with Fox, and Disney had Treasure Planet. Neither film did well at all, and it killed traditional 2D animation.
Well, that's quite a legacy. Being the guy who sort of brought 2D films back only to kill them off a couple decades later.
I think he's trying to get a Dragon's Lair film made now. He hasn't made a movie since Titan A.E. in 2001.
He did the Dragon's Lair video game? Crazy.
He also had another animated game that was similar called Space Ace. It wasn't as successful though.
Even if he's not doing much now, seems like he did accomplish quite a lot once.
