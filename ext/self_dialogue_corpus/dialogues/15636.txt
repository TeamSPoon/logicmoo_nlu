Have you heard the remake of Careless Whisper?
No I haven't, who was the original singer?
George Michael originally sang it.
Who remade it?
Seether did the remake and I think it is better than the original.
I will have to look that up.
Yes, I think you will like it.
Sometimes the remakes are much better than the originals.
I agree, have you heard Disturbed's version of Sound of Silence?
Yes, they did a great job.
I agree, they bring that song to life.
Some of the remakes aren't so good though.
Yes, like Marilynn Mansons Tainted Love.
I agree, he should have left that alone.
Reba's The Night The Lights Went Out In Georgia is also a remake.
Yes, but she did a fantastic job with that song. Shamless by Garth is a remake.
I never knew that. He sings it so well.
I think most of the remakes done by country artists come out well.
Yes country artists are great performers.
I agree, we should listen to some of these.
