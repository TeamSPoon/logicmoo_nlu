I just saw Lucy last night.
I loved that movie.  Scarlett Johansson was great.
Yes, she sure was.
Who directed?
Luc Besson, from Taken.
He does good work.  I forget the other actors.
Morgan Freeman was the only one I recognized.
Wasn't that a wild ending?
Yes, Lucy dematerializes.
Such a waste of a body!
