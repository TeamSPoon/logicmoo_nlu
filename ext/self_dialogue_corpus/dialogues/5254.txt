Hey, did you see the new Beauty and the Beast movie?
Yes, I hear it was breaking all sorts of records when it came out.
Yeah, I heard that too.
What did you think?
I liked it. It followed the cartoon really closely, but there were some new scenes and some things were explained better.
What do you mean?
In the original animation, they said that the rose would bloom until his 21st birthday, and later they said that they'd been cursed for ten years.
So... the prince was 11 when he got cursed?
Yes. if some lady comes to my house and asks my 11 year old to let her in, I would want him to say no.
Good point.
