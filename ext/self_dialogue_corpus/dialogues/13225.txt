Do you remember the Sand People from Star Wars?
Oh yeah, they were in the first one
Right at the desert planet of Tatooine
Yeah, they tried to steal Luke's speeder and the droids
But Obi Wan Kenobi scared them off
Remember they rode those big elephant looking things?
Those were called Bantas
Right, bantas. They were big creatures
And they had those crazy eye things
Yeah, they were kind of creepy looking.
