i wanna see paramore live so bad.
how come?
dude what? hayley williams is amazing.
did you get the newest album?
its so good. it reminds me of the 80's
hard times is my jam.
the new album sounds so happy but hayley is so sad there.
her lyrics are more emo than ever to be honest.
exactly but its a nice contrast with the melodies
the melodies are so upbeat and bubble.
it really is.
i love rose colored boy too
i love the way she moaned certain lines in that song.
how come?
it showed how dissatisfied and annoyed she is.
i'll have to check it out again.
i mean, in the first verse.
hard times is still my favorite though.
i like fake happy.
that song is so real.
