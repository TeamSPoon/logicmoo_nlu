What's your favorite way to watch horror movies?
Alone, on my computer, in the dark, with digital headphones on.
Sheesh, that's specific. Why?
It's the best possible way!
How so?
It's the best atmosphere: by yourself and the sound really comes through.
I love it in theaters.
Why?
The audience is awesome and it's on a huge screen
That's why I can't: if there are teens there they egg each other on and talk the whole time. Irritating.
