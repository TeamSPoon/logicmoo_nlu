Are you looking forward to football season?
Definitely!  I'm a huge fan
Me too.  Which team(s) do you root for?
I'm from Tampa so I like the Bucs. What about you?
Nice.  I like the Falcons, the Patriots, the Seahawks...
Wow, you follow a lot of teams.
Yeah, I'm really into it.
Do you do fantasy football as well?
Sometimes.
Yeah me too but I'm more into just watching games, following my team, etc.
So are you a fan of Jameis Winston?
Yeah, I went to Florida State so I followed him through his college career as well.
Cool.  He definitely went through some controversy during college but he's done well in Tampa.
Yeah, I agree. Who are some of your favorite players?
I'm a huge fan of Tom Brady, I know a lot of people are over him but I think he's great.
Yeah, I get that.  He is a great football player.
Definitely, there's something to be said about all those Superbowl wins!
Yeah.  I love Peyton Manning.  I know he's retired now but he was an awesome player.
Him and Eli both.  I was sad to see Peyton retire.
Yeah, but it's fun to see him in all those Nationwide commercials!
