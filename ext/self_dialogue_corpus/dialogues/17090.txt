Did your family ever force you to watch the Sound of Music growing up?
I remember watching it a couple times with my mom.
Yes me too. It wasn't too bad but I'm not a huge fan of musicals.
What was the name of the family in that movie again?
The Von Trapp family.
Oh okay that's right!
If you had to choose a favorite song from the movie which would you pick?
Let me see, I really liked the "Sixteen Going On Seventeen."
That one was a pretty song. Especially how it was sung.
You also can't forget the classic "Do-Re-Mi"!
Yes that was a true classic and a good one also.
I know the main actress was really famous but I can't for the life of me remember her name!
It was Julie Andrews!
Right right I remember now.
The cast did so beautifully together and sang so wonderful.
They really did. It's a classic musical.
Yes it is.
Oh I just remember another song! "My Favorite Things."
I loved that one! I had forgotten too.
She did a magnificent job on that one.
