Have you gotten into any animation films?
I think Spirited Away was the last movie I have seen
There are a ton of good ones!!
Like what?
I like Finding Nemo
Oh yea, I've seen parts of that movie.
And also a lot of other Disney movies like Up.
Man, I really think I need to watch more animations
It has a different feel to it then with real life action films
I can see that, its an easier way to escape reality
Definitely, because there is less realism
Whats your favorite animation?
I'd say Shrek
I did see that! It was awesome.
Yea, the comedy elements, the story were all well done!
The sequels were good too!
I think Eddie Murphy was the best part of that series
Yea, the funniest character was Donkey
Disney has a lot of good movies
Yea, they are not just for kids either!
