I want to watch a Will Smith movie.
He has some really good ones to pick from.
I know, he is my favirote actor.
He is putting together a great film career.
He sure is! I love him in just about anything .
What is your favirote film of his?
That is very hard question!
Come on you have to have a favirote .
I would say Independence Day or Hitch.
Those are both really good movies.
What about you?
I loved Wild Wild West.
Yea that one had some really good action scenes in it.
Yea that is a big reason why I love it!
Have you seen Bad Boys?
I sure have! I watched them both.
Him and Martin Lawrence were great together.
They sure were!
Enemy Of The State was another great movie from him.
I loved it as well. He sure knows how make a good movie.
