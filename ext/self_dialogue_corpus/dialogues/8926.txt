Did you hear about the hoax about Axl Rose from Guns and Roses?
No, what happened?
Somebody put up a Facebook page on June 20th saying RIP Axl Rose, with an obituary saying he had passed away, asking people to sign their condolences on the page.
He didn't really die?
No, apparently fake death hoaxes has become quite the thing, but a bunch of people fell for it and were signing the page and upset by it.
What kind of sick person thinks it's funny pretending someone has died?
Quite a few sickos I guess, since apparently a long list of celebrities have had this kind of hoax reported about them.
I don't think it's funny upsetting people who believed it was true.
A bunch of fans questioned it, because it wasn't being reported by major news sources, but hundreds of fans fell for it and were writing condolence messages on the page.
Guns and Roses had some really devoted fans, so I can imagine there were a lot of upset fans when they read that.
