What do you think is the best Marvel movie theyve put out
Since the beginning of time?
In the last 8 years.
I would say Ironman.
Thats just what started it.
I know but I think it was a great movie.
I liked Captain America the best
I thought it was good but Ironman stands the test
Infinity Wars should be better
Thats got a ton of players in it
Do you think its going to be long?
It has to be at least 3 hours.
Do you think people like watching a movie that long?
Sure why wouldnt they?
It can get boring
If the script is good, it wont
And those writers Marvel has are good
I Think the production is also stellar.
Hopefully they dont end the universe
I think we see alot of character spin offs
