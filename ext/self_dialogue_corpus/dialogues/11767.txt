I hate getting stuck in traffic. Do you want to play a music trivia game while we are waiting?
Yeah, I'll go first. I will give you three clues and then you have to make your guess.
Okay, but you have to say if it is a person, song, or a band. Stay in our era I don't know much about today's music.
Alright, this is a four man band that popular in the sixties.
Were they Americans?
You can't ask questions, just listen to the clues. The second clue is they are from Liverpool.
Well, I think I got it but I will take the last clue.
Their first hit song was in 1962 named "Love Me Do".
It has to be the Beatles. Now it is my turn to give you clues.
Give me clues that give me a real chance of figuring it out like I did you.
