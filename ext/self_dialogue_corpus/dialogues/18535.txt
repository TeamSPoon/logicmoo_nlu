I could listen to Beyonce all day.
Me too. I love her older and newer music.
What's your favorite song by her?
I really like Irreplaceable.
Wow, that song was released so long ago.
I know. Her music has changed so much since then.
What was your favorite song from her most recent album?
I loved Formation.
I really liked that song too, and the music video was even better.
I know. The first time I watched it, it gave me chills.
I felt the same way when I watched the video for Adele's song Rolling in the Deep.
I love that song.
Adele's voice is always so powerful and soulful.
I agree. Her song Hello gives me goosebumps every time I hear it.
That song was such a great comeback for her after she had been out of the music scene for a few years.
I know. I really respect that she took time away from her music to focus on her family.
Me too.
What is favorite song by Adele?
My favorite is Set Fire to The Rain.
I really like the Skrillex remix of that song.
