What's your favorite type of music?
I know too many! I guess I like country.
I like country too. I just sold an Alan Jackson cassette.
Yes, I like his work.
He sounds poppy though, doesn't he?
All modern country sounds poppy.
Oh, tell me about it. I miss the old Merl Haggard days.
Oh me too, when country was country.
When Cash was king.
When Cash was king.
Say, I like the cut of your gib.
Thanks partner, you too.
Do you want to watch a concert with me? It's Rascal Flatts.
He's a country megastar!
I know right! I'd love to take you.
Wow much knowledge! I'd love to go. When is it?
It's Tuesday at 7:00 at Citi Field
I'm down. A "Country Boy Can Survive" after all?
Yes, yes indeed. That there is down-south humor.
See you then!
