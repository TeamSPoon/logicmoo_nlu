What's your opinion on Miley Cyrus?
I definitely like her new stuff but I'm not so crazy about her older stuff.
Same. I'm currently obsessed with her new song "Malibu."
Me too! I've had it on repeat for hours.
I put it on blast whenever I'm in the car!
It's just such a perfect summer song!
Agreed. I was just listening to her older music and some of it takes me right back to middle school.
I can't really stand her older stuff but sometimes I am in the mood to blast some Hannah Montana.
Oh, of course! I grew up listening to it and sometimes I just need to get back to it.
Agreed. It's not even quality music but I just can't stop listening to it.
"Rockstar" will always be my jam.
Same here! It just makes me feel so good about myself and like I can conquer anything.
Yes! It never fails to put me in a good mood.
And I also like "Don't Wanna Be Torn."
Me too. It's so funny looking back now but that song helped me through my first heartbreak.
Oh, middle school love!
Right? Middle school was a wild time.
Remember we always used to listen to the Jonas Brothers too?
How could I forget?
I miss those days.
