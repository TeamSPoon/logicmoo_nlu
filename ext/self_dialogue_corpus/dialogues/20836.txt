Have you seen Central Intelligence?
No, who is in that?
The rock and Kevin Hart.
Hmm, maybe I have. What's it about?
It's the one where the Rock and Kevin Hart went to highschool together and they meet up again as adults.
Oh, I remember watching the previews.
Oh you should definitely go see it, it's great.
I don't have time for movies, just tell me about it.
Ok, well back in highschool Kevin Hart was the super cool kid, and The Rock was the fat loser that everyone bullied.
Oh, I can see where this is going.
Yea, but Kevin Hart was the only one that was friends with the Rock.
Ok, go on.
Well 20 years later, Kevin Hart is stuck at a boring job that he hates when suddenly the Rock contacts him with a new name and asks him if he wants to hang out.
But really, The Rock is a spy right?
Right, and the Rock is trying to get some information out of Kevin Hart because of the kind of work he does.
This doesn't sound very funny.
Yea but it really is. Every scene is full of humor.
So the two of them are essentially enemies?
Well, kind of, but really deep down they are best friends, and in the end they work together.
Oh ok, it sounds pretty good.
