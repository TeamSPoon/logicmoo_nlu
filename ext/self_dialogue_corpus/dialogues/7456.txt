What did you think of the  movie Brave?
The one with Merida?
Yes
That was quite good.
I thought it had a good story for teaching girls to be brave.
And making them stand up for themselves.
Yes and she was really good with that bow and arrow.
Yes she was!
Disney makes some great movies!
And a lot of money!
