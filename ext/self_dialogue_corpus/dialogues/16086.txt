Have you ever heard of Otmar Liebert?
No, who is he?
He is a guitarist that has been around a while but he has a really unique sound?
What kind of music is it?
It almost has a spanish/flamenco sort of feel.
Sounds interesting!
Yes, it is such beautiful music!
I will have to check him out!
Yes, look for a song called called Barcelona Nights.
Okay!
He has another great song called Luna Negra.
Okay, I will look for that one too.
I would love to see him in concert.
Does he tour?
Not much. When he does it is usually out west.
That's too bad.
Yes, I would love if he would come to the south.
If he ever does, let me know!
Yes, I'd like to see him once before I die!
Put that on your bucket list!
