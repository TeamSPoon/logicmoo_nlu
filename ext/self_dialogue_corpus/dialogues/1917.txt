What are examples of wrong teams being in the playoffs?
The panthers beat the falcons in the "who is the least crappy in the nfc south" bowl for the honor of facing Arizona's third string QB in the playoffs
Lindley was our 4th, not 3rd QB. I really hated that season.
Wait what? I remember Palmer -> Stanton -> Lindley. Who else was there?
Logan Thomas was just after Stanton
That's Logan "I only throw 88 yard TDs into tight windows" Thomas to you
1/9 81 yards TD. What the heck even was that game.
The completion was his first throw too I think
That's like the 3rd string qb that was ahead of Brady on the pats. First career pass was a 70 yard Hail Mary, then he was like 2/9 for 20 yards and an int after that.
still better than 0/8, he could have at least thrown an interception, then we would know he was at least throwing near a receiver.
I'm not sure which was a more hopeless playoff run - you that year or the Vikings with Joe Webb.
How did we even lose that game when we beat them in their own house a few weeks earlier. That just ticked me off Matt Ryan didn't even seem pumped
That was my first NFL game. Not a great first game. It was the falcons continuously failing to move down the field.
My first season was 2010 and I felt pretty slapped in the face with how that ended too.
Well Ryan "The God" Lindley also almost beat you with 64 yards total in 2012.
Matt Ryan threw five picks he seemed really off that game.
There was a reason for the attitude in the game. That year the team was basically playing for Coach Smiths job.
So we threw the game because mike smith didn't think he would keep his job.
The same way the Bucs are gonna keep missing the playoffs: Mike Smith "Toughness"
Yeah, except Mike Smith isn't running crap but the defense and they have improved from an already solid team.
