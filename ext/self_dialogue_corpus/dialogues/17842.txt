What's your favorite song?
Currently it's "Sandy" by Whirr.
I like that song, but it's pretty emotional.
I guess it's pretty obvious I just broke up with my boyfriend.
There's nothing more therapeutic than music, though.
That's true. Currently that whole album is on my playlist.
Which album is that again?
Distressor. It's a really great album.
Whirr reminds me a lot of that band called Nothing.
I think they've done some collaboration together.
They are the only American shoegaze bands that I know.
Now that you mention it, all the popular ones are in Europe.
There are some really good Japanese shoegaze bands I could link you to.
What's the first band that comes to mind?
Clams. Listen to any of the songs.
I usually just watch the music video ones first.
That's a good idea. They have good music vidoes, I think.
I look forward to watching.
I think watching a music video makes the song sound better.
I agree.
