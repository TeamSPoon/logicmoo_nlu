Hey do you watch football?
Oh yes, I love Manchester United.
No, I mean American football, not soccer.
Oh, well we call our game "football" in England, not "soccer."
Well do you want me to explain American football to you?
Okay, go ahead.
Well, despite the name "football" only the punter and kicker really kick the ball.
Whats the difference between the punter and the kicker?
Well the kicker kicks field goals and the punter punts the ball to the other team.
What is a field goal?
When a team kicks the ball through the big yellow uprights they get three points.
I see. Why does the punter punt the ball to the other team?
Well if the team with the ball doesn't advance it 10 yards in 3 tries they can either punt it to the other team or try again to get the needed yardage.
So why don't they try again every time instead of punting?
If they don't make it on the fourth try the other team gets better field position.
What's field position?
That is a measure of how close a team is to the end zone.
What is the end zone?
That's the other way to score, if you bring the ball to the end zone it's a touchdown worth 6 points.
That seems a lot more complicated than our football!
