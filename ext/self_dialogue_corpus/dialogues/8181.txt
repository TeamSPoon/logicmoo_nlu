have you heard of Julia michaels?
She sings that issues song right?
Yes and she is also a songwritter too.
Anything or anyone  I would know?
Rita Ora, Beiber, Fifth harmony,Selena Gomez and ed sheeran.
Oh wow she has worked with a lot of artist already.
She has indeed. I am glad she is coming out with her own stuff now.
It is always weird to think of a new emerging talent as already so connected behind the scenes.
Yes it is. Similar to Sia as well.
Ya, I was also shocked to learn of her songwritting past.
