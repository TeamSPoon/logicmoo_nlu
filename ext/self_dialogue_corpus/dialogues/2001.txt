What are your thoughts for NFL football this season
I don't know, I always get my hopes up for the Lions, but they always disappoint me
Ha! That's true maybe this will be they're year
Yeah, I always think that right around the 3rd or 4th game, but by the 10th game I'm usually brought back to reality.
Do you think we'll ever see them at the Super Bowl?
Honestly no, I think I'd faint if we ever made it into the Super Bowl.
Well in the mean time I'll be pulling for The Bears
Uh, not again with The Bears
What? They are a solid team!
Yeah yeah yeah, we have this discussion every year.
Don't be bitter because they have more solid seasons than your Lions
Okay lets not go there
I think we'll both just be happy of the Patriots don't make it to the Super Bowl
Ain't that the truth. I'm so over them even being in the Super Bowl
I know Brady doesn't need another ring.
Right, he's gotten too cocky.
What do you think about the Sea Hawks?
I wouldn't mind seeing them go all the way
Agreed, ya know, them or the Bears
Or the lions.
