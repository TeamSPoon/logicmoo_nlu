Hey, it's you again. We seem to meet often.
It does appear that way. Are we doomed to repeat these conversations over and over again?
Not unlike that Groundhog Day movie with the delightful Bill Murray.
And the not so delightful Geena Davis.
You're thinking of the baseball flick with Madonna. I can see how you'd make the mistake. They're essentially the same.
How do you figure that?
Groundhog Day is about a seemingly endless series of the same day and the baseball flick just seemed endless.
If you like Groundhog Day, then you'd probably like another movie just like it called Primer. It's horribly overlooked.
What!? They aren't the same at all. Groundhog Day is about a time loop and Primer is about time travel.
They're both about time.
That doesn't mean that they're the same. That's like calling Oreos and Hydrox the same.
They are the same. They both have white goo between two somewhat bitter chocolate wafers. How is that different?
Well, one is kosher.
I think we're stuck in a loop. I'm going to punch you out like Bill Murray did to Ned in Groundhog Day.
Here's an interesting factoid about the movie. Did you know that part of the movie was filmed in Racine, Wisconsin. The chase scene.
There wasn't a chase scene. Have you been smokin' again?
Yeah, the one where they were chased by cops through a mall.
That was Blues Brothers, you moron.
I don't have to take this abuse. I'm leaving. I'm tapped out anyway.
Thank god.
