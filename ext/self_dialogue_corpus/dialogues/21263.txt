I didn't like that new X-Men movie one bit.
I thought it was pretty good.
What did you like about it?
I liked the special affects and Munn as Psylocke was my favorite part.
Yeah she was pretty good.
So, what didn't you like about it?
The story. It's too different from the comics.
I've never read the comics.
Be glad you didn't or you'll be like me right now.
All the characters are there aren't they?
The story line and character origins are all screwed up.
I guess they don't want to follow the comics that closely.
I'm never watching another X-Men film again.
I don't know. I thought these last three movies were better than the first three.
Those were equally bad.
I think you should just stick with reading the comics.
I did like the scenes with Quicksilver in them, though.
His power is he runs fast, right?
Yeah, why?
The way they portrayed him in the movies, I thought he was slowing time instead.
