What do you think was the best movie of 2014?
I really loved The Fault in Our Stars
What? Are you kidding me? That movie?
Why do you say that?
It was such a teenybopper film! There were so many other films worth seeing then!
oh yeah? Like what?
Well for starters, there was a planet of the apes movies that came out around the same time.
Oh did it? Was that Rise of the Planet of the apes?
No, it was Dawn of the Planet of the Apes.
Oh yeah, I did see that one now that I look back
And? Wasn't it better than the faults in our stars?
Nah, i found it to be quite boring actually
What do you mean boring?
I felt the story went on to long.
At least the effects were good!
Nah, the effects sucked too. The monkeys look really fake to be honest with you
Maybe your taste in movies is just bad
have you ever seen the fault in our stars?
No actually
Try it out. It has some heavy dramatic acting, and it was a lot better than I expected it to be
