Have you seen any new Disney movies lately?
No, I haven't.
Why haven't you seen any?
Mostly because I'm a fan of the older Disney movies that I was able to watch while I was in their target age group.
So you feel like you've out grown these types of movies?
Pretty much.  Sometimes I still enjoy children's movies from time to time.
Could you name some of the movies that you can remember from your childhood?
Yes.  Bambi, Sleeping Beauty, Pinocchio, and Cinderella are a few that come to mind.
Are these movies you would show to your children?
Absolutely.  The content of these films is perfectly fitting for a child.
