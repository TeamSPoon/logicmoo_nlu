Did you see Finding Tory?
Yeah, that movie was so hyped!
It was a really good movie, Gerald was so cute!
Yeah, Gerald should have a spin-off movie, he's popular.
Yeah right? Enough of baby Nemo and baby Dory, it's time for grown up Gerald.
Exactly, Gerald, Gerald, Gerald.
What about the story line, should it be like, Finding Gerald?
Well, we had finding Nemo, finding Dory, maybe we can take it to another level.
Hmm, good idea. How about Gerald finding success, or Gerald finding the meaning of life?
Excellent ideas!
