You ever hear about the rock band KISS?
Heard of them? My uncle is a huge fan, he never shuts up about them.
That's funny, does he have any cool memorabilia?
Well, he actually owns a life-size cardboard cutout of the band, it's quite a spectacle to see.
Hahahaha! Your uncle seems like my type of guy, what do you think about KISS though?
I like them too, but I'm not a die-hard fan like my uncle is. He told our family to bury him in a KISS coffin if he ever passes.
Tell your uncle I want to be buried right next to him! KISS army for life man!
He'll definitely find that funny. So, what are you doing later today man?
Nothing today, I'm just going to stay at home and listen to some music, as usual.
Alright man, well, if you ever want to meet my uncle, I'll let you know when he comes over.
