Hey, have you heard the latest album from Linkin Park?
I'm not sure. What's it called?
One More Light. It just came out in May.
Oh, I haven't listened to it yet, not sure I want to.
Why not?
Well the little bit I've heard about it isn't good.
I really like it. What do you mean?
People are complaining that it's too poppy.
Yeah, it's more pop than some of their others but they've always kind of walked that line haven't they?
Maybe. Some of their songs though have been pretty heavy and there's always at least a little of that in their albums.
You can only hear the same thing so many times before you want something different though, right?
You might be right, and some of their pop-like stuff from before I've really liked.
You might not like the whole album but some of the songs are excellent.
Yeah? What's your favorite?
Probably the title track, One More Light. It's beautiful.
What do you like about it?
Chaz's voice is really excellent and it has some great lyrics.
What's your favorite line?
The chorus. "Who cares if one more light goes out in the sky of a million stars."
Ooh, I do like that. I'll check them out!
