What did you think of last year's Super Bowl?
I was disappointed, I really thought the Falcons had it.
You're right, they did have a 28-3 lead after the first half.
Brady really brought the Patriots back though.
Yeah, but not until the 4th quarter.
He really proved his greatness!
Not really, I think he's fading.  He missed a lot of opportunities in the first half.
And it was such a long game, 4 and a half hours!
I couldn't believe it when the Patriots made that 2-point conversion! Yeah, and with only 6 minutes left!
I still thought the Falcons had it in the bag...
Especially after Jones caught that 27 yard pass that put Atlanta on the Patriots 22 yard line!
Yeah, a field goal and the game would have been over.
Things really turned when Ryan got sacked!
And that holding call on Jake Matthews - I was losing hope fast.
Yeah, going from being on the 22 yard line with a chance to clinch it, to having to punt was a real let down.
I was so tense, I coultn't stand it!!!
Then Edelman catches the ball on the 50 yard line!  1:28 was plenty of time for Brady to at least tie the game...
Which he did! And then the Patriots won the coin toss.....
Yep, then the Patriots march right on down the field and win it all.
It wouldâ€™ve been great to see if Atlanta could have regrouped and won.   Maybe this year.....
