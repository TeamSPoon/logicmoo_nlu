Hey, do you like movies?
Anyhting specific, or just movies ingeneral?
I like the Coen Brothers.
Me too. Everyone likes them.
Actually, I took a girl to No Country for Old Men, and she said she didn't like it.
She sounds like a suppressive person.
She totaly was. I like Millere's Crossing though.
I haven't seen that one.
It's great, it's got Jon Polito in it, he's awsome. And Gabriel Byrne.
Oh, wow. I love Jon Polito. He's so, like, authentic.
Yeah, he plays theis mob boss. He hets all the best dialogue.
Oh wow. What does he say?
Well, his opening dialogue with these other mobsters is great, and when he leaves he's like 'you's is fancy pantses, alla ya's,"
That sounds awesome
Yes, I greatly appreciate that sort of witty dialogue.
As do I. I must see it. Who else is in it.
John Turturro is in it.
It wouldn't be a be a Coen brothers movie without John turturro. I'll bet its got steve buscimi too?
Oh, man it so does. And there's this scene where Turttro is being led through the woods and they're gonna kill him. It's the best.
So, can I borrow it?
