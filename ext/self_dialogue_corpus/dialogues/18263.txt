You know who I think is one of the most overlooked bands of the past?
Who is that?
The Carpenters, do you know them?
I have heard of them, but I don't think I know any of their songs.
Oh I bet you do.
Okay, well try me.
Well to name a few-Sing, For All We Know,  and We've Only Just Begun.
Okay, maybe I do know a few.
Which one did you know?
I think that I know all of those songs.
See what I mean, they are overlooked. Everyone knows there songs, but no one feels like they really know the band.
I will have to try to get my hands on some of their music because I do really enjoy that style.
I really like a lot of songs from that time period.
I think there were a lot of good, true muscians in the 60's and 70's.
Not like today's music. Half of it is computers.
True, I really do not enjoy most of it. If half is computers, another good chunk is just them talking about crude things.
That is so true, and why I listen to music from the past mostly.
Well you can find some good stuff outside of top 40.
Like what?
Country still has some good muscians with more wholesome music.
