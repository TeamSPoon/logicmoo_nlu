What film did you love as a child?
Big bird follow that bird!
Ha, the one where big bird runs away?
well he gets adopted by the dodo's and runaway back home to sesame street.
I remember this movie. A mean adoption agency worker bird is after him.
Ya. Do you recall when he gets painted blue?
Yes the song he sang always made me cry when I was little.
It really was a good movie.
I remember it well and fondly.
Just like sesame street had a good mix of human and puppets.
I have seen the one actor who played gordon once in a while on tv.
I think I had noticed him on law and order.
That may have been it. He is still recognizable from childhood.
There were some bigger names in follow that bird too.
Like who?
Well John candy and chevy chase, sandra bernhart too.
Now I recall sandra and John candy in it. Not chevy.
He was the newscaster reporting on big bird.
oh, you don't realize who people are when you are young watching it.
It is interesting to go back as an adult and see what else you missed in old favorites, like adult jokes.
