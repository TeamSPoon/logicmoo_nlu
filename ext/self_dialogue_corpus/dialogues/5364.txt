Disney did a version of Peter Pan too, right?
Yeah, that was a good one.
Agreed. Though being a kid forever doesn't sound as good as it once did.
No, the immortality thing is maybe a bit frightening. That's why Wendy ultimately has to return home.
Maybe Peter should have taken a page from her book.
Yeah maybe. But I think his role was to be a foil for Hook.
Someone had to keep him in check.
Right, and that wasn't going to be Smee! Or the Lost Boys for that matter.
You'd think that Tinkerbell could hold her own - fairy dust and all.
I'm still very unclear on what fairies can and can't do.
