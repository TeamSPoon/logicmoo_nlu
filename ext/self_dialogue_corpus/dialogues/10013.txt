Have you seen the Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 2?
No, I have not. What was it like?
I saw it Sunday, and it was fantastic. It got 8 out of 10 stars for the reviews.
What is this one about plot wise?
Peter Quill and his fellow Guardians are hired by a powerful alien race, the Sovereign, to protect their precious batteries from invaders.
I saw some commercials on tv about it, and the director did a nice job with the special effects.
Yes, and Groot is in it as well, a smaller version of course.
Who stars in this one?
Chris Pratt, Vin Diesel, Zoe Zaldana, Brad Cooper again are in this one.
Sounds great, I want to see it.
