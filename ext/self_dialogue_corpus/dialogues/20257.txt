Did you like the Exorcist?
Still the scariest movie I've ever seen.
I have to agree with you.
Linda Blair did awesome as a young actress.
She was fabulous.
Didn't she struggle mentally for awhile after that movie?
I believe so but I'm not sure to what extent.
Wasn't it based on a true story?
Yes it was which makes it even scarier.
Ellen Bursttyn played a great part as her mother.
Yes,she was an established actress.
Max von Snydow played the priest right?
Yes he did.
Lee J Cobb was another veteran actor in the movie.
He was good too.
Jason Miller as the younger priest was really good too.
He was great too,yes.
The Exorcist II didn't do to well.
A lot of sequels don't.
Man that's for sure.
