I'm marking off the days on the calendar to the most exciting day of the year.
What day might that be?
The 2017 NFL season!
I though you said before that Superbowl Sunday was the most exciting day of the year. Changed your mind?
OK .... second most exciting day of the year, second only to the Superbowl.
I'll make a note of that.
Hey, didn't you tell me before that you worked on a Superbowl when you first graduated from college and got a job at an ABC affiliate?
Yes, that was me.
I so envy you! I wish it was me who got to be on the field during the game.
That wasn't the best part for me.
What was?
A college friend of mine who lives in Florida is a team doctor to a football team. They gave him two 10th row tickets but he didn't want to come to Minnesota sothey sent them to me.
Why did you need tickets for, you worked the game?
I didn't use them ... I scalped them.
Did you stand on the street yelling "tickets for sale?"
No. This was pre-internet so I looked in the want ad and found an ad from a professional scalper. I called and they told me what hotel they were in.
You, a college girl went alone to a scapler's hotel room?
NO! My dad took me. He was only 5 ft 6 in so he wouldn't have been much help had anything gone wrong.
So what happened?
I knocked on the door, they opened it with the chain still latched, asked me to show them the tickets, I showed them, he closed the door and came back and slipped an envelope stuffed with $100 bills. I made $1,500 in 1991 money. Fun times.
