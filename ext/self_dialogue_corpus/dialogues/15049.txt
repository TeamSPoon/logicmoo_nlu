I really liked the movie 21 Jump Street. Did you see it?
No, was it funny?
Yeah, it was probably one of my new favorite movies.
Is Jonah Hill in that?
Yeah, he's one of the main guys.
I liked him in Superbad.
I never saw that. I heard it was kind of crude.
Yeah, it was a bit, but it was still funny.
Maybe I'll have to watch it sometime.
Yeah, you definitely should.
