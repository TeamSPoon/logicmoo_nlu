Who are some of your favorite rock groups?
I;m more old school.  I like Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, and Metallica.
Those bands are good.  They don't make them like that anymore.
Of course you have Nirvana.  They were amazing.
Do you like AC DC and Queen?
Not as much as the other bands I mentioned, but they are still some of the best of all time.
What about the Rolling Stones and Kiss?
You know, I respect their talent and what they have done, but I have never been a huge fan of those two grops
I almost forgot about Guns and Roses and the Who
Now your talking!  Another two groups that are some of the best ever.
