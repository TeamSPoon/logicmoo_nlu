Remember that scene is "Attack of the Clones" where Yoda went all crazy?
All crazy? Oh wait, yeah, that one battle scene?
Yeah, haha, when he was all flipping and jumping everything against Count Doku! That was awesome!
That was so funny. The entire series, he's all old and frail looking and then he whips out all of those cool battle moves!
I know, the entire theater was laughing so loud when that scene happened!
And then goes back to hobbling away with his cane after the battle. That was so funny!
Yeah, Yoda is really a great character. One of my favorite Jedi in the series for sure.
I wish they would have had him do more scenes like that in the other movies.
I know right, but at least we got to see it once!
Go Yoda! haha
