Who do you think will win the NBA title this year? I believe the Cavs will repeat.
I am inclined to agree, but the Warriors might be tough.
Yeah, if 2 of the studs from the Warriors get hot, they can take down LeBron.
I agree with that point. If Durant and Curry get hot, they will win.
Don't forget Thompson and Draymond....
I didn't. But can they play enough defense against LeBron?
LeBron can get all the points he wants. It's the other guys they have to stop.
So, you say Lebron can score 60 and the Cavs can still lose?
That's what I'm saying...Just don't let Kyrie or Love have big nights.
I agree. if they do, then Cavs for sure.
Are you even watching the playoffs? They are boring this year.
I don't usually watch until the Finals.
You think anyone can knock off the Cavs or Warriors before then?
No chance, unless someone gets hurt.
I think the Cavs will whip the Celtics in the conference finals.
If the Celtics even make it. Don't sleep on the Wizards.
Yeah, if Wall stays hot, they can take Boston.
But no shot against the Cavs though.
They could win a game or 2 at most against the Cavs.
You're absolutely correct. No way the Cavs go down
