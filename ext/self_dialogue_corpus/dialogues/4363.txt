What is your favorite thriller movie?
It would not be a movie, but a series, the Scream series.
Oh I remember those.
They are such suspenseful and gives me thrills.
I agree.  I liked the very first one.
Me too.  It was the scariest and featured Carmen Elektra getting killed?
How did she die?
At the beginning of the movie she was stabbed by the person in the scream outfit.
Oh I remember now.  That was sad but gruesome.
Yea, as the movie went on it gave the audience plenty of thrills and chills.
