do you like nu metal
i like slipknot
no limp or korn
no, their lyrics were so stupid
its not like slipknot had intelligent lyrics either
touche. youre right but they were more metal than rap
and still better lyrics than limp at least. korn were ok though
korn were so angsty for no reason
well, they did do a lot of drugs
and childhood issues?
i know the singer had a lot of problems
yeah, he looks like he would
slipknot had one good album though
which album are you thinking of?
iowa. that album was heavy
it was super heavy. their self titled and vol 3 were great too
vol 3 had a lot of filler
but songs like pulse and vermillion made up for it
thats when they got softer
that is true
