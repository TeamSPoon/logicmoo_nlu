What is your favorite thriller movie?
I would have to say Behind the Mask.
I haven't heard about that movie.  What's it about?
It's a mockumentary that plays on the trops of classic horror films.  The setting is a college film crew is interviewing a potential psycho kill who is prepping hsi next big kill.
That sounds kinds messed up.
It is, but in a funny way.  The movie has a lot of dark humor.  What's your favorite thriller movie?
I'd have to say it would be Inception.
Oooo, good choice.  That movie is awesome.
I know right? The special effects, acting, and that ending.  Holy crap.
I know! I still don't know if he was asleep at the end or if it was real.
