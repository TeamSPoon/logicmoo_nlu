Have you seen the newest trailer for The Last Jedi?
Yeah I am so excited to see that movie.
I feel like we are finally going to figure out who Rey's parents are.
I sure hope so, but I am more interested in life without Han Solo.
Oh I know I wonder what Kylo Ren is going to do.
I have no idea, but I think he is going to have a dark storyline.
I like when they have serious conflict, so I hope that Rey and the crew battle in out with Kylo Ren.
I agree. I am excited to Finn's storyline in the Last Jedi.
I really like the new generation of characters we are getting, but I am excited to actually see more of Luke Skywalker in this one.
I love Luke Skywalker, so I feel the same.
