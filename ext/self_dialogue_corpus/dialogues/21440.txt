Have you seen The Princess Bride?
Yes, that is one of my favorite movies of all time.
Why is it your favorite?
Oh gosh, probably the dry and obvious humor. That guy, Vizzini, has the funniest lines. And his laugh gets me every time.
I've heard it has some romance aspects, too. Would it be a good date movie?
I think so, actually! There is an element of romance in it, although it is comedic and overdone.
So it has sort of a Monty Python vibe?
Yeah, but sort of tamer and with more famous actors.
Which actors are the most famous ones from that movie?
It has to be a cross between Robin Wright and Andre the Giant.
Wasn't Robin Wright on that new Netflix series, House of Cards?
Yes, I think she is a classic actress. The same actress who played Jennie in Forest Gump.
Neato. What are your favorite lines from the movie?
Probably when Vizzini is challenging Wesley to a battle of wits.
I think that's supposed to be an epic scene for this movie. Sort of like Russian roulette only with poison.
Yes, the rediculous part is that the "iocane powder" actually kills the guy who pours the wine.
How does that happen?
Well Wesley, one of the main characters, has been apparently building a resistance to the drug for years.
Weird. Yeah, this movie seems like a hit. I think I will check it out when I have my date.
You won't be disappointed! Good luck, bro.
