What is your favorite romantic comedy?
Tough questions.
I thought so.
Ok. I will accept your challenge!
Game on!
My favorite is either "When Harry Met Sally"...
That is a good one!
Or "Serendipity."
Sarah who?
Not Sarah! Serendipity!
Serendipity...wasn't that a child's book about a dinosaur?
I think you are right, but this is a totally different Serendipity!  This one starred John Cusak and Kate Beckinsale.
Oh, I like those actors!
Yeah, and it's about two people who meet by chance while shopping, and have a fun evening together.
Sound simple enouigh.
Yeah, but here is the kicker. At the end of the evening, the Kate Beckinsale character insists they part without telling each other who they are or how to find each other again.
What? That's insane!
She insists that if they are meant to be together, fate will intervene and theywill be brought together again.
That's nuts. So, did they find each other again?
Only after years of searching. It was really funny, and kind of cute too!
