Do you know who The Chainsmokers are?
Of course who doesn't?
Hey you never know.
You would have to be living under a rock to not know them.
What do you think of their music?
Honestly when I first heard it I enjoyed it.
Did not expect that from you.
Yea, something about it just really appealed to me.
Which song was it?
Roses was the one.
That's a pretty old one, it really kicked off their success.
Yea, the more I listen to it the less I like it though.
In what way?
It is just too repetitive and poppy.
All their songs do sound very similar.
Yea, it is almost like they distilled it into a formula.
It sure sounds that way, pretty simple.
They are insanely popular though.
Yea, the radio is playing them nonstop.
Good for them, they've come a long way.
