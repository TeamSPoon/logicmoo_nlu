How good do you think the jets will be this year?
You mean how bad?
Ok,how bad.
Absolutely terrible.
Don't sugarcoat it.
They have a past his prime Matt forte.
His better years are definitely behind him.
They have no quarterback.
How about josh mccown?
How about he's a journeyman at best.
Who else do they have at qb?
Christian hackenberg and Bryce petty.
Not exactly household names.
They cut their best receiver,Brandon Marshall.
Who their rivals the Giants signed.
Big pickup for them.
Fox sports has the jets winning under 5.5 games.
I think that's safe to say.
I'm not sold on Todd Bowles as head coach.
I'm not either.
