Did you like Ed Sheeran's last album?
Honestly, I was a little disappointed.
Seriously, why?
I think it's because in a lot of ways he tried to get back to roots and it felt forced.
So you like is top 40 stuff?
No, I like all of his music, I'm just not into Division.
I see. Did you like any of his songs?
I thought Nancy Mulligan was nice.
What about Shape of You, that's my favorite.
Shape of You is really catchy. A lot like don't from Multiply.
I agree.
Whats your alltime fave?
I like Sunburn from when he was a teenager.
That's good. My favorite is Bloodstream.
why?
I really love how it sounds when he plays it live. It literally reverberates inside you.
How many times have you seen him live?
three times.
Does he have a lot of vibratto live?
Not exactl, but he projects a lot.
