Is there a venue you wouldnt see a performer play?
I think stadiums and arenas are dumb,
Yeah the acoustics are really bad for those type of shows.
Plus I hate sitting.
Yeah whats the point of listening to music in a seat.
Exactly and the price for those shows is usually astronomical.
I agree, I would not go there.
How about you?
Probably the same as you, I also dont like outdoor events.
Like Warped Tour?
Yes. I think theres too much going on.
Have you ever been to one?
No I cant say that I have.
Well let me tell you, they are the worst.
OK so you are confirming my suspiscions.
Its hard to get close to the band and theres 5 of them playing all the time.
Is it packed?
Yeah well theres thousands of people there at any given time.
Strange because they seem to tour a bunch of cities.
They do and thats why its confusing as to why its so packed.
