What do you think about all the NFL players.
I like pretty much all of them.
Andrew Luck is my favorite.
He is good.
I feel he is underated.
I do too.
He has not had a line that has protected him.
YEah they all are different.
I do have to say that they have had tons of different lines and they have done their best.
yeah they are one of the most teams who went through the most.
Hopefully their new gm will help.
I think he will do good things.
He has spent the whole summer switching things up.
Yeah he is trying hard.
I feel he will do better than the last.
He has replaced many players.
I think he will help them improve.
He is very consistent also.
I cannot wait to watch and see how good they are.
I have a feeling they are going to have a great season.
