Did you hear about Keenan Low?
No, what happened?
He's a free agent now.
No way.
Yes, he got dropped.
From the Patriots?
Yes.
Did something happen?
Yes, he got injured really bad.
On the field or practice?
During the pregame season.
Oh no.
He pulled his ACL, and got an ankle sprain.
That sounds painful.
I know it was.
What's his new team prospect?
Nothing yet.
He probably needs to heal more.
Yes, I'm sure.
He'll be ok.
