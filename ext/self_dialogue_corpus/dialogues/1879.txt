What team do you think is going to win it all this year, NFL-wise?
I've got to go with my Jets! I feel it this year!
Man, that's crazy! Who is your QB!?
Umm... I must admit.. I'm not entirely sure.
See! They're gonna be trash, once again!
I think it's still Fitzpatrick! He's decent!
Decent doesn't win championships!
He just needs the right cast around him.
More like a miracle around him!
Yeah, yeah. Let me guess... you think that the Saints are gonna take it all this year, huh?
AP is there, so you know it!
He's old now though. In his thirties!
So? So is Lynch, and you KNOW he's gonna tear the field up!
LaGarette Blount DID have the most TDs last season.
Whoa, whoa. No need to bring the "Cheatriots" into this conversation!
My bad. I know how much you hate them.
But yeah, the Saints just need a defense, and they made some good moves this offseason.
I like Brees, you know that much.
Oh, yeah. He deseres another one.
He is a QB in the most pure sense. I agree.
