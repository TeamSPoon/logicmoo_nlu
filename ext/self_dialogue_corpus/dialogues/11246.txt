Who was the best dressed at the Met Gala this year?
There were many choices, but I really liked Rihanna's outfit. It flowed with the theme. And those shoes! Wow!
She was very beautiful. Very different and stayed with the designer theme, Rei Kawakubo.
I agree completely. What did you think of Kim Kardashian's look?
It was definitely simple, white dress yet elegant. Her makeup matched perfectly with the dress.
I did not expect that from her at all. I thought it was a very interesting choice.
Yeah...I also really enjoyed Jennifer Lopez's dress! It had a certain flare and beautiful colors!
It was gorgeous! It reminded me a little bit of Elsa though from Frozen!
Haha! Yes. I guess it does have that characteristic.
What about Blake Lively's dress?? I adored her dress!!!
Can you remind me what she wore? I completely cannot recall...
She wore a plunging gold gown heavily embellished with fringe-style beading and blue feathers that cascaded down the train.
Oh my, that was gorgeous! Although I did not particularly like her sleeves, they hung too loosely and it made her arm a bit flabby.
I can see where you're coming from. I still love the feathers though!
Yes, those were great! Let's talk about Kendall Jenner...
Oh yes! What is there NOT to talk about? She was stunning!
Kendall always brings her A game. Those 85,000 crystals were to die for!
I was speechless when I saw her. Her shoes matched perfectly! Definitely a show stopper.
I loved this year's gala! I want to wear one of those dresses one day.
It was indeed amazing. I look forward to next year!
