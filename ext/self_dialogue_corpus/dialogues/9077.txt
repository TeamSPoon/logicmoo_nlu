Do you think that rock music is still viable?
What do you mean?
Well, there's a lot of other genres available today.
Yes, that's true. Hip hop and country are strong competitors.
Yes, and classic rock seems to be the main genre of rock.
What's wrong with that?
Well, it's kind of a dead genre.
What do you mean?
Well, there can't really be new classic rock as something new can't be old.
I disagree. Over time, the classic rock genre incorporates new classics. It just takes time.
