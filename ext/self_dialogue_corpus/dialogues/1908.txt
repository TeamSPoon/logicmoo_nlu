How many Super Bowls did the Steelers win back in the 1970s.
Four.
Wow, when did they win their second one?
1976, for the 1975 season.
What number super bowl was that?
Super Bowl X
Oh so number ten?
Yes, that's what X is in roman numerals.
Who did they play in that one?
The Cowboys
Oh wow, I bet that was a big one.
Yeah, Cowboys are a fan favorite team.
Well, not for everyone
But they do call themselves America's team.
I think the Pats are America's team.
No way, only if you live in New England
Same goes for Dallas. Only if you live in Texas
Not really. Houston can't stand them.
Yeah, that's a good point.
I wonder what San Antonio thinks of them.
