Do you like Irish music?
Yeah it's ok.  I usually only listen on St Paddy's day though.
Yeah, but it still sounds good.
It has an earthyness to it.
How about Drop Kick Murphies.
Yeah, they're awesome.  Saw them in concert.
You know who else has an Irish sound?  Mumphord and sons.
Yeah they do.
That Irish sound is good for just sitting around with a beer.
Well after a few it makes you want to dance a jig haha.
Ok, you got me there.
I also like Bondo.
I know what song you're talking about.  F' you I'm drunk.
That was just funny.
And how about worst day since yesterday?
Also a classic.
Irish music seems to be both happy and sad at the same time.
Except Irish wake music like Danny Boy.
Yeah, well Celtic music can be relaxing.
Yes amazingly so.
