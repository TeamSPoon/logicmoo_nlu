Who is the better quarterback Joe Montana or Steve Young?
There is no such thing as a wrong answer here. But you have to go by different years.
Why do you have to go by different years, just who is overall?
Because you have say, Steve Young 1993 vs. Joe Montana 1988.
Steve Young I know ended his career with a better overall passer rating I think.
True 23 more rushing touchdowns too.
Don't forget though that Young also played on great 49ers teams, ones that Montana help build.
Very true, Montana helped build those
Montana is who you wanted if your team was down 7 points, at the 2 minute warning to tie the game.
So you say hands down Montana?
I'm thinking Montana is a god and Steve Young is top ten?
Montana proved how great he was when John Elway scored with like 40 seconds left to take the lead against the chiefs.
Yeah and then Montana drove those sorry butts down field and scored to win the game.
Young learned a lot from him and took the team to the superbowl in 94.
I think I'm super old school so Montana might be my final pick too.
I've grown to respect young more and more over the years though probably after he retired.
Too bad he didn't get consistent playing time til he was in his 30's and past his prime.
True, who knows what he could have been now.
So I guess Montana everyday and twice on Sunday.
I agree, respect for Joe but Montana for sure.
