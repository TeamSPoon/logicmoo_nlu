Whats your favorite decade for music?
I would definitely pick the 80's!
I would too although i like the 70's also.
The 70's music was amazing also but I was very young during that time.
If you had to pick a favorite band or singer who would it be?
There were so many great ones that it's tough to choose, Journey, REO, Styx, Billy Squire, .38 Special. The list goes on.
Why do you love the 80's music compared to today's music?
The 80's music was actually music. You could hear and understand the words and it had meaning.
I agree, I'm not a big fan of the music of today. It all sounds the same.
Do you have a favorite band from the 70's?
I would have to say the Bee Gee's. Classic. I love all their music.
Their Saturday Night Fever album is one of the best.
Sad that Barry is the only one left but I still love his voice.
I know what you mean. Such a legacy though.
Speaking of Saturday Night Fever. Did you ever hear the song John Travolta came out with?
Yes "Let Her In" I thought that was the best song ever when it first came out!
What I love about all that music, is that when you listen to it, your immediately brought back to a great memory.
Right? Anytime an REO Speedwagon song comes on, I'm back in my senior year in High School!
I keep hoping that music will start being music again!
I couldn't agree more.
