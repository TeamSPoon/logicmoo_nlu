I watched A Nightmare on Elm Street and I don't know if I should watch the sequels.
You definitely should! At least watch some of them. Especially Wes Craven's New Nightmare.
Is that the remake?
No, it is a sequel after one of the times Freddy Krueger supposedly dies. But it is directed by Wes Craven, who also did the original.
If Kruger is dead, how can they make a sequel?
This movie takes place in "our" world, with the actors and even Wes Craven playing themselves. Even Robert Englund plays himself.
Whoa, that sounds meta! Does he still play Freddy or what?
Yeah, but the Freddy that appears isn't the same as the one in the first movie. It's scarier and less funny, the way Craven originally thought of it.
Is the same girl the main character?
Heather Langenkamp is the lead, yeah, but she's an adult and is kind of tired of only being known for her role in the Nightmare movies.
