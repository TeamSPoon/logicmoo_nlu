Do you like The Beatles?
Like them? I love them!
Wow, me too!
What's your favorite album of theirs?
I would probably go with Sgt. Pepper.
My favorite is Abbey Road.
I love Abbey Road too. But Sgt. Pepper has a more fun and charming feel.
Yeah, it does. But I like the focus, warmth, and modern production on Abbey Road.
It definitely has the most modern sound of any Beatles album.
Those songs would all be hits if they came out today.
Oh yeah, for sure.
Who's your favorite Beatle?
That's a classic question. People have been asking that since day one.
I know. And it's still an ongoing debate.
My favorite is Ringo. I like him as a person more than the other Beatles.
That's an interesting view. I think Ringo would be last on most people's lists.
Yeah, but they're thinking more about the musical contributions.
My favorite is Paul.
I like his musical contributions the most. Even more than John's.
I totally agree with that. I even prefer his solo stuff over John's.
