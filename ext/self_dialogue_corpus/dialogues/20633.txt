Has anyone seen the new Transformers movie yet?
No I haven't , it looks great.
I have not seen it, but plan on going to see it.  I liked the first movie quite a bit.
Yes, I look forward to it as well.  Who else plays in it, do you know?
Mark Wahlburg, Isabella Moner, and Anthony Hopkins is even in this one.
Wow, I can't to see it!
As soon as I saw that Anthony was in this one, I knew I would go.
Everything Anthony does is so high quality.
For the story line, the team is trying to save the world again.
Mark Wahlburg does a nice job in his action movies as well.
Do you know who the director is in this movie?
Michael Bay is the director in this one.
How much has it made so far?
I think it is already near $300 million in the first week.
I would call that a successful movie launch!
I am sure Hollywood is thrilled!
Too bad most actors don't see anything close to that money.
Yes, it is a rough business.
That is probably why most talent do not even go that route.
Very true, unless you have backup, you cannot even think of it.
