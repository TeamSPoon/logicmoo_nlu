What's the scariest movie you ever seen?
Probably the Exorcist.
Yes that was pure horror at its best.
Yeah, plus good acting.
Yeah, everyone gives Linda Blair the credit but she didn't do the voice.
It was all Mercedes MCabridge.
Yeah, no one remembers her but we all remember Linda Blair.
Almost like the opposite of the movie where everyone remembers her as Satan and not Regan.
Interesting point.
She does deserve credit for what she did with her body.
Yeah, that was what was so horrifying.
And that makeup was creepy.
Still gives me chills to this day.
I hope they never remake that.  Make as many sequels and copy cats as you want but leave classics to be.
Yeah, horror genius.
It's in everyone's top scariest list.
I can't wait for October.  I love going on a horror binge.
I start in September.  Just to get ready for October.
I see, so you can get the classics out of the way and then go digging for new ones.
Never fails.  Every year I find a hidden gem or two.
