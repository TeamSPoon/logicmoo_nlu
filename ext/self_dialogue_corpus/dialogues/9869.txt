What ever happened to that rapper C-murder?
He's serving life in prison without the possibility of the parole at the Angola State Prison in Louisiana.
Jesus christ. What happened? This is the first time I'm hearing anything about this.
The entire sequence of events is pretty crazy but long story short he was convicted of killing some 16 year old kid outside of a Louisiana nightclub in 2003.
2003? I know for sure he released an album in like 2008 or 2009.
That's why I said crazy sequence of events. He had like 3 different trials for the murder, but Louisiana has some messed jury laws and he was eventually convicted and setenced in 2009.
I always loved his music. That's really sad to hear. Life in prison with no parole is no joke.
Yeah I agree. You know his brother his Master-P right? I think C-murder is trying to get his case heard by U.S. Supreme Court.
I know his brother is Master-P. Oh wow, the Supreme Court? That'd be insane if he eventually got out of prison.
I really hope he does, I don't think he's guilty but instead staying to true to his roots. I've heard some people in New Orleans say that Souja Slim actually killed the 16 year old kid but C-Murder is so real that he wasn't going to rat out his now deceased friend for committing the murder.
