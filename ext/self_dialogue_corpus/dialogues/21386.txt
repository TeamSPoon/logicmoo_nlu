That was an awesome movie! So unexpectedly fresh, and funny!
Right? Yeah. And who'd have thought Jack Black could be funny without wearing spandex?
Yeah. And I really liked that British chap, too. He was also quite funny in this movie.
Jude Law...yeah. Great casting choice to have him play someone in need of a nanny for his kids.
Oh, and I just loved the "movie trailer maker" character. The one that couldn't cry...
Oh, yeah.  Cameron Diaz.  She's really developed as an actress since her debut in "The Mask"
Even the old guy next door was funny!
Eli Wallach. Did you know his work dates back to the spaghetti westerns...although he was eating Matzah balls in this movie.
Who was the guy Careon Diaz punched?
Edward Burns in another winning role, as an adulterer without pants. Surely a shrewd career move to show his range as a serious actor.
I would have rather seen "Jim" from "The Office" play that role. Now that would have been unexpected.
I think you could be on to something...
And what was the name of the British lady...the one who got jilted by the sleazy writer?
Kate Winslet
Wasn't she is that vampire movie
No, you are thinking of Kate Beckinsale. She was in the "Underworld" series of movies.
I thought that was Cate Blanchett?
No, Cate Blanchett was the Ice Queen in the Narnia series.
I thought that was Tilda Swinton.
It's a little know fact that Tilda Swinton IS in fact Cate Blanchett.  She created a second identity in attempts to get more auditions.
