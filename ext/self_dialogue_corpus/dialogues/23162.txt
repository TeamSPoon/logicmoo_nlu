Do you like the Paranomormal Activity movies?
I did at first.
What happened?
Well, I just really like Found Footage movies.
What's a found footage movie?
You know, it's a movie that is supposed to look like it's real, like you literally found the footage of some regular person and watched it.
Oh right. Ok that makes sense.
Yea, so I've been a fan of found footage since The Blair Witch Project, it lets me get into the movie a lot easier.
Yea same here.
But yea, the first paranormal activity had me on the edge of my seat the entire time because I was waiting for something crazy to happen.
Only the first one?
Yea, because after that first one, I could of understood nothing big was going to happen.
Yea the movie is really more about anticipation.
Right, but anticipation only works if you don't know what's coming next.
True, but you don't know whats coming next in the other ones.
Not necessarily, but I had low expectations, and they ended up being right.
Yea, I guess you're right, they are all pretty much the same.
Yea they really are.
Well, I'm sure they are going to make another, maybe it will be better.
I wouldn't hold my breath.
