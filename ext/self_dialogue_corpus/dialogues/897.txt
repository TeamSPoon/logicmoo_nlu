Do you think this upcoming NFL season will be good?
Absolutely! I think this season is going to be the best yet.
Who do you think may have a good season with the NFL this year?
Statistically, the patriots are strong.
This season I am going to stay strong with my favorite team in the NFL, the Steelers!
The Steelers do seem to have a good line up.
Do you like the new rule changes in the NFL this season?
Yes, I think the newer rules will make the players safer and the game more interesting.
I really am tired of seeing the Patriots in the super bowl.
I am too. I think everyone is, except maybe Patriots fans.
I do not care for the seahawks either. How about you?
No, another team I am tired of seeing. As well as the Cowboys.
Oh Yeah! The cowboys are terrible but they used to be a great team. Do you think?
They have bad management and a bad coach.
I agree, I am a Steeler fan though so I am a bit biased. Steelers have a great team.
Steelers are good, but i am a ravens fan. They are pretty strong too.
Over all this NFL season with the changes should be more interesting.
I think so too, I just hope they get the players out that continously cause issues.
Yeah, Some of them are gonna cause a player to get hurt badly.
I agree though, This will be a memorable NFL season
