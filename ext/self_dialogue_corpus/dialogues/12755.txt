What's the best Star Wars movie?
My favorite has always been Return of the Jedi-- I loved Boba Fett and the Ewoks.
My favorite is the Emprire Strikes Back, though the new Force Awakens was really good too.
Yeah, it was a lot more relatable, I thought.  A lot more contemporary.
What do you think about the prequels?
I think I'm with the general consensus that they were largely terrible.
Yeah, though I did love Watto.
And, who can forget Darth Maul?
Yeah, I'd love to see more with him.
I wonder if they'll ever put him in another movie?
