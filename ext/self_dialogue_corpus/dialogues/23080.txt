what movie has a strong female lead that you enjoyed?
You may not know it but a film called cracks.
You are right never heard of it.
It was a bit more indie. Eva green is in it.
I do know her and think she is talented and beautiful.
She certainly is.
What is this film about?
It takes place at an all girls school.
So was eva really young , how old is this film?
No actually she plays a teacher. It came out in 2009.
I see. Who directed?
Jordan scott.
Another new name to me.
It is worth watching but kind of twisted.
Now I am very intrigued.
It was unique.
Has he directed any other films that are more known?
Funny, jordan is actually a female.
Oh, goes to show what I know.
I think of jordan typically as male as most do. But to answer you no huge movies to speak of really. But check cracks out.
