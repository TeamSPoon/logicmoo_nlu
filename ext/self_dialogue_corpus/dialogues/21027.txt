I've been watching a lot of movies about race in America.
Which ones?
First, "Moonlight."
That wasn't about race per se. More a slice-of-life coming of age movie about a boy who happened to grow up in a drug-riddled ghetto.
But still, the main characters were African American.
What are the other movies you've seen about race?
"Get Out," Jordan Peele's 'psychological thriller' (his term), and "I Am Not Your Negro," the documentary about James Baldwin.
They were all great movies. All three of the ones you mentioned. I saw them, too.
Didn't "Moonlight" remind you a little of Truffaut's "Les Quatre Cent Coups" ("The 400 Blows")?
Yeah, both are coming-of-age stories about young boys who grow up in a troubled household.
And who are ignored by their parents.
The drug dealer in "Moonlight" was a much better protector for the young boy than his own mother was.
That's because she was a drug addict.
Yeah. Better to be the pusher than the user.
So, now that I've exhausted all the latest African American films that aren't "Medea" movies, I need to find something else to see.
I'm going to see "A Quiet Passion," about the very white Emily Dickinson. Wanna come?
Oh, I saw that. Cynthia Nixon was great, but the movie was dreadful.
But it got a rating of 98 percent on Rotten Tomatoes!
Yeah. It got a great review on the Ebert site, too, and probably elsewhere. I must be missing something.
Well, I promised Dana I'd go. So, I'll have to sit there and cringe while all the old ladies in the audience sob and sigh.
