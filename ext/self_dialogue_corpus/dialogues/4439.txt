Do you like thriller movies?
oh yeah, watching a thriller always make me feel refreshing after a day's mundane work
ok, the movie I'm referring to is The Ring
I heard there are multiple iterations of them, which one should I watch?
oh, definitely the one with Naomi Watts in it, she's such a brilliant actor
oh Naomi Watts, I've seen her movies, she's really great. Looks like I have to watch the movie
haha, I hope you don't get panic with phone or TV after watching the movie
yeah, why is that, doesn't make any sense?
well you'll know once you finish watching the movie
now I can't wait
