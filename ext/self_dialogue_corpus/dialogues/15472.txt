Hey, do you listen to Gorillaz?
Of course, I love them!
Have you listened to their new album yet?
Are you talking about Humanz?
Yea, what did you think?
I personally did not like it that much.
I felt the same way at first but then it grew on me.
It really didn't stand out that much to me.
Which do you like the best?
Of their albums?
Yea, how would you rank this one with their others?
I liked their first and second the most.
Demon Days was great.
Yea, I think that one is my favorite.
Do you remember who produced it?
It was Dangermouse.
That's right!
Yea, and Dan the Automater did the first one.
That was really good too.
Yea, one of the classics.
