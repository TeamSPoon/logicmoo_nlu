Do you know anything about football?
Are you talking about European football or American football?
What's the difference?
Well, European football is what Americans call Soccer and American football is like the NFL.
What is the NFL?
Are you serious? Everyone knows what the NFL is!
Well I don't. I don't like sports much and I don't follow it at all.
You must have been living under a rock! The NFL is the National Football League.
Oh okay, so you mean the big teams like the Broncos and the Cowboys.
Yes that's right. Those are actually two of my favorite teams.
How can you like a Colorado team and a Texas team when you are from New Mexico?
You don't have to be from a particular state to like their football team.
I think I like the Seahawks then.
Why the Seahawks? What is so special about them?
They are an NFL team aren't they?
Yes they are but why does that matter if you have never heard of the NFL before?
It doesn't matter. I was just asking.
You never answered why you like the Seahawks.
It's because I like their colors. Blue and green go really well together and their logo is cool too.
You're hopeless! What difference does it make what colors they choose? It's about how well they play the game.
