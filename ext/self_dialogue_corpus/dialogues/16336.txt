I hear you really like Bruce Springsteen.
You heard right.
So, if I asked you any song, could you tell me what album it is on?
I could tell you most of them, but probably not all.
Well let's give it a shot. How about Badlands?
Well that's an easy one! It's my favorite song and my favorite album. Darkness on the Edge of Town.
Ok, how about Blinded by the Light?
First album - Greetings from Asbury Park.
I didn't even realize he sang that song until recently.
I know. It didn't really become a big hit until Manfred Mann's Earth Band sang it.
Doesn't he have another song like that?
Well, the two he wrote for others that went big were Fire and Because the Night.
Because the Night was Pat Benetar right?
You know, I always thought so, but it was actually Patti Smith and then 10,000 Maniacs.
Oh I forgot about them. Didn't they have a female lead?
Natalie Merchant I believe.
Did she ever do anything solo?
Oh yes, for many years. But I couldn't tell you one of her songs.
I'm sure she has some that we'd know if we heard it.
Right. We just don't realize it is her.
