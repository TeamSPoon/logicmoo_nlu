I am in the mood to watch something!
Me to, how about a movie?
What kind of movie?
I am not sure, how about a horror film?
I do love scary movies!
Great, I have pretty much all of Stephin King'S movies.
Stephen King is the best!
I agree, his films are always creepy.
Do you have the movie It?
I sure do!
That one used to scare me as a child.
Yea, I have hated Clowns ever since.
Me and you both!
So, is that the one you want to watch?
I am thinking about it. What other ones of his do you have?
I also have the Shining and The Golden Years.
I have seen The Shining but not the other one you mentioned.
The Golden Years is really long, but very good.
I am excited, lets watch it!
I will get the popcorn!
