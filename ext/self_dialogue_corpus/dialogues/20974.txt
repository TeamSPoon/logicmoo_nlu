Hey, I'm looking for a World War II movie to watch this weekend. Any ideas?
Saving Private Ryan is good. You can't go wrong with Tom Hanks.
Seen it a hundred times.
Oh. Who are you watching with?
My grandpa.
I would recommend a A Bridge To Far. It's about D-Day.
Oh, kind of like Band of Brothers?
Yes, but just a movie, not a series. It was made in the 1970s.
Okay, any other recommendations?
There's also The Boy in the Striped Pajamas, about a concentration camp. Kind of depressing though.
Oh, yeah, I've heard about that. The son of the German commander makes friends with a prisoner or something?
Yep. Does not end well.
Hmmm, something lighter, maybe.
Ok, Inglorious Basterds is less of a downer. Brad Pitt, George Clooney, and some dark humor.
That might be good. Do you know of any old movies about WWII?
He has probably seen Mr. Roberts. It's an oldy but goody. Takes place on a Navy ship. Very moving.
Oh, yeah, my mom loved that movie. Jack Lemmon right? She loved Jack Lemmon.
Well, you have some choices.
I think I'll queue up Mr. Roberts, for old times sake.
Cool. Have a good weekend!
