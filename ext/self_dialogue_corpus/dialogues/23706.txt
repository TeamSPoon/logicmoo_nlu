Did you see the Star Wars Rogue One film?
Yeah I caught it on the big screen in 3D.
So how was that? I didn't see the 3D version.
It was awesome visually.
I'll bet. For me there were issues with the story.
Yeah I agree.
It was hard to feel sympathy for the female lead.
She wasn't that likable.
But I liked the two Force-sensitive characters, like the blind man, they were good.
I didn't like any one else really except Leia at the end.
It was weird how they digitized her.
Darth Vader really kicked people's behinds too.
He was awesome, in a bad way.
Scary right?
Mmm Hmm.  They digitized one more character, I couldn't tell at first.
Yeah I saw that.
Guess that's the future of movies.
Seems like it.
I think Star Wars will go more and more that way.
Star Trek too.
