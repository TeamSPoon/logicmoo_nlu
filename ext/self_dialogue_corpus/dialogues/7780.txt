I think they did great making Harry Potter into movies.
I disagree.
Why? What was so horrible about them?
The first two or three were fine. I saw number four and it was twisted. Nothing was making sense. It was just flashes of scenes. They weren't connected.
I thought it was good.
Yeah, but you never read the books. You don't know what they left out.
Like what?
Who drew the Marauders map? You've seen all the movies now, right? So who drew the map?
uhhh. I don't know. Did it ever say?
No, they didn't. The movies never said who created the map and that sucks
