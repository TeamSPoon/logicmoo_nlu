Did you see the Cavs game?
Yeah, I did.
What did you think?
I was pleased with the win.
I hope they go to the playoffs this year.
That would be really great.
Do you think LeBron is better than Michael Jordan?
Maybe technically as a player, but I think Jordan was a lot more likeable.
He was a bit more down to earth than King James.
I definitely think LeBron's choices keep him from being the icon Jordan was.
Jordan was my favorite player as a kid.
Mine too.
That stint in baseball was ill-advised, though.
I can understand wanting to try something new. He had done everything there was to do in baskeball by the time he was 30.
That's true.
I think when he returned to basketball it was more for the money than that he wanted to continue playing.
I agree. He was never quite the same when he came back.
Nothing is usually as good the second time around.
I can agree with that. Are you watching the next Bulls game?
No, I stopped following them a while ago.
