Hey man do you think they will still be going on about Deflate-Gate this year.
I hope so it seemed to unify the Patriots.
That's a team you don't want to give an edge to.
I think Brady didn't say much but he had a chip on his shoulder all season for the last couple of years.
He didn't need any extra motivation but they gave it to him.
Yeah when they talk trash about you you feel the need to prove them wrong.
And do the talking on the field and not with your mouth.
Bellecheck is pretty good at keeping his guys quiet when stuff like that happens
Yeah, his players that don't know that are soon playing for some other team.
Yeah and if he really gets mad maybe he'll trade you to Cleavland
Yeah I wonder how Jamie Collins likes playing for the worst team in the leauge
Should have kept his mouth shut instead of complaining to the media.
I hear rumors that Cleveland wants to trade New England for Jimmy Garoppolo.
I heard that too on ESPN I think.
I think Bellecheck will keep him though.
In this league you always need a class second stringer in case of injury.
They could franchise tag him this year see what happens and trade him next off season
That would be smart.  I bet that's what they do.
I hope so he's good enough to start for most of the other teams.
And he lasted longer in the league than Johnny Football.  I mean Johnny Manzel.
