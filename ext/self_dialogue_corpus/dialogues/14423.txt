Are you going to watch the Cavs game tonight?
Of course I am! You?
No, I can't stand to watch LeBron.
Yeah, his complete and utter dominance of his opponents must be intimidating to watch for a Warriors fan like yourself.
Something like that...you know the Warriors will crush the Cavs in the playoffs!
Just like they did last year?
Ok, but the Warriors have Durant now.
Yeah, and the Warriors only picked him up to get him out of their way....
I'm not going to argue with you there.
It'll be a good match, unlike the Eastern finals right now.
Yeah, the Celtics are getting embarrassed.
I'm glad. I've hated the Celtics ever since Olynyk ripped Love's arm out of his shoulder in 2015.
You know he didn't do that on purpose!
You would say that...you probably defend Draymond Green kicking all these guys, too. I'm sure that's always an "accident."
Hey, if Green were on your team, you'd like him.
Not true. His body fat percentage is way too high for an NBA player, and he just plays dirty. I don't appreciate his style of play in the slightest.
Well, in any case, I'm looking forward to watching another Cavs/Warriors finals.
I am too. Hopefully the Cavs don't have to come from behind like last year.
Hopefully you don't get a chance to, because the Warriors will sweep the Cavs!
Yeah, yeah...go Cavs!
