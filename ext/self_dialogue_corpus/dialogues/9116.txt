Do you like Judas Priest?
Yes, they have some great songs.
My favorite is Hell Bent for Leather.
That is a good one.
Those guys are still touring and making music.
I remember blasting them when I was in High School.
I know, back in the mid 80's.
They has so many popular songs.
Rob Halford has an excellent voice.
He does. Funny looking, but his voice is great.
