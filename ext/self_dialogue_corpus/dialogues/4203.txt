Did you ever see The Fugitive?
The movie, sure.
What did you think I was talking about?
Well, the movie was based on a series that used to play.
Oh, really?  I didn't know that.
Yeah, it was on back years and years ago.
Do you know when it ran?
Back in the sixties, I think.
Was it good?
I don't know.  I never watched it.
