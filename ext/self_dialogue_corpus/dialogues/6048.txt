Chicken Little was just an okay movie. Did you ever see that one?
Yes. You are right though.
I mean it had cute characters but the whole boy who cried wolf story. I don't know.
I know.
I didn't recognize any of the voices except for Joan Cusack.
I didn't even know she was in it.
I'm sure there were other stars we'd know, but I couldn't tell.
Did your kids like the movie?
Well they watched it, but not over and over.
Well then I guess they agree with you.
