Do you like Adele?
No, I don't.
I love her. Why don't you like her?
She has a great voice but just sings these ballads.
Yes, but I like them. Anything else you don't like?
I don't like the way she dresses, she is very young but dresses like and old person.
Did you like her before you saw her?
No, it was the ballad after ballad that really started me not liking her and then when I saw her it just added to it.
Who do you like?
I like Lady Gaga.
Why do you like her?
She has great songs and a great voice and l loved the way she dressed.
I have grown to like her but didn't like the way she dressed.
You see that she doesn't dress so crazy now or cover her face.
I noticed how she changed. What is your favorite song by her?
I like almost everything, but something about Million Reasons really touches me.
I like that one too, that was a ballad and it is in my head a lot. I'm surprised you like that ballad, and not Adele?
It is because Adele does mostly ballads, but Lady Gaga does not.
Oh, I see, I do think Lady Gaga is evolving and I like it.
Yes, me too.
