I just came back from Seeing The Force Awakens. I don't understand why people think that Rey is a Mary Sue.
Because she can do everything so easily, without any training.
Yes, she did everything so quickly and so easily, like she was following some sort of quick and easy path.
You think she's going Dark Side?
Just watch it.  She's a huge ball of anger, and she uses the Force when he's angry, it's classic Dark Side.
I don't think that's the intent.
Maybe it wasn't, but the signs are there.  She doesn't start beating Kylo until she's angry. That's Dark Side right there.
That's a good point.  Rey is flirting with the Dark Side.  I don't think the guys at Disney are that subtle, either.
True. It's possible that they completely missed the point.  I wouldn't put that past them. But that's why we have death of the author.
I bet the next movie completely fails to confirm your idea.
