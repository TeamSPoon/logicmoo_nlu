What did you think about that new M. Night Shymalan movie?
Which one are you referring to?
I think it's called Split.
That was awful.
Really?  I thought it was kind of creative.
I'm so sick of him trying to do twist endings.  It's comedic really.
This one wasn't really a twist, it was just surprising that it was actually true.
Nah, sorry, it was garbage.  Just my opinion.
Do you think they'll make another Unbreakable with the reveal at the end?
Doubtful.  That ship sailed long ago.
