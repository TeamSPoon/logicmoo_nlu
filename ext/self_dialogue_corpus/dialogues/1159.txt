I wonder who the oungest QB to win the superbowl is...
You and your questions
I'm curious, Curiosity is good
Curiosity killed the cat, anyway, Roethlisberger was 23, when he won it for the steelers.
Who's the youngest QB, period?
Mariota and Winston are both 22.
They have no chance of being the youngest QBs to win the superbowl, then
Nope. There is no way Titans or Buccaneers will be a superbowl winning teams within this year.
Haha, yeah. Huh. I think being the youngest QB to win the superboal is more impressive then.
It's a rare thing, but not more impressive, it's mostly luck.
Why do you say that?
Because you have to be a good QB, and happened to be drafted by superbowl winning caliber team.
Oh, right, you sort fo have to be in the right place at the right time.
Yep. But given good enough QBs, it takes time to build a superbowl caliber team around him.
Huh. what do you know.
But, they are getting younger on the average
How so?
Well, the average age of Superbowl winning QBs from 1998-2012 was around 28 or so
That's kinda similar to the average age of the superbowl winning team.
Yep, which happens to be aroudn 27 or so. it just take time for these players to develop into that caliber.
