What is something that bothers you about the characters in Harry Potter?
Well, I always thought the Ginny transformation was quite abrupt.
What do you mean?
Well, she went from all shy to being an absolute badass.
Yeah, that's true, but I think that happens to a lot of kids once they reach a certain age,
I get that, but you would have thought they would have eased us into it a bit more.
True. In the course of one summer (between books) she became completely opposite.
Exactly. I love her character and feel like it was necessary though.
Also, do you think the Harry and Ginny romance was tacked on?
I don't know, I always kind of rooted for it, so I might be biased though,.
