What do you think the best movie lastyear was?
I'd have to say it was Deadpool.
I haven't gotten to see it yet.
You have to see it, he is an evolution of super hero.
Isn't he just a mercenary?
He's so much more that that, but yes he kills a LOT of people.
Whats so great about it though?
It's just how he acts; there are so many 4th wall breaks it's like you're actually in the movie.
Who is in it?
Ryan Reynolds, nude for most of it.
What kind of superhero movie is this?
The kind that is awesome.
It doesn't seem like a kids movie though.
That is absolutely true, but it's great that there is finally a hero that gets things done.
So it's basically one long snuff film?
It is so much more than that, he is very quick with a weapon, but he is much quicker with a quip.
I still don't see the appeal.
Trust me you would love this movie; it's the funniest thing you will see for a long time.
Until Deadpool 2 comes out I assume?
Absolutely; you can come if you want, but I'm gonna watch the blue-ray right now.
