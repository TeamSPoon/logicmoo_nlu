Do you like science fiction films?
Very much! I have a collection of them at home, from the 40s onward to the present day.
Why do you love them so much?
Science fiction in general is a great mechanism to comment on human nature. I learned to see the world from a different perspective when I started reading sci-fi.
Do sci-fi movies do the same thing for you?
Sure. Take for example the Planet of the Apes films - the original series that started in the 60s, those are the ones I mean.
I remember Charlton Heston in the first one - "It's a madhouse! A madhouse!"
I think using intelligent apes to comment on humanity was brilliant. With sci fi, you have license to say anything.
What are some of your favorite sci-fi films?
Of the Alien franchise, I liked the second one, Aliens, the best, hands down.
James Cameron did a good job with that one. Great cast and story, lots of wonderful action.
I think it's one of Sigourney Weaver's best movies.
What about more modern sci fi? How about Guardians of the Galaxy?
I remember seeing the trailer for that one before it was released, and I was so underwhelmed. I had no desire to see it.
Did you change your mind?
Yes, my husband wanted to see it, so I was like, Ohhh kaaay, I'll give it 15 minutes, then I'm outta there.
Was it as bad as you expected, or better?
I actually enjoyed it very much. The wisecracking transgenic raccoon was my favorite character, I think.
I guess that goes to show how important a good trailer is.
Definitely. Or a significant other who makes you watch a movie, ha.
