The Empire Strikes Back is, in many ways, even better than Star Wars.
I think that's because the filmmakers take the time to explore the characters. In the first film, they were more like archetypes.
The psychological examination Luke goes through - from Yoda, but also from his own perspective - was very intriguing.
He had to confront that he had a dark side that he needed to control. That was a major realization for him.
And it sets up the big reveal at the end that he is, in fact, the son Darth Vader, the epitome of evil.
I saw the film for the first time with my sister, and she was so shocked by that revelation that she refused to believe it at first. She was so mad!
But it's such a great mythic element to the trilogy. It shows just how vulnerable Luke is to being seduced by the Dark Side of the Force.
The other character study is Leia coming to terms that she is falling in love with a scoundrel. She's so frustrated at herself!
Han Solo doesn't evolve that much in Empire - his big evolution came in Star Wars when he came down on the side of the rebels.
But Leia, this totally moral upstanding princess and stateswoman, has a lot of self-learning to do when she falls for Han.
