Do you prefer hard rock or soft rock?
I like both but prefer hard rock.
Do you have any favorite bands?
I love Metallica, Guns N Roses and Led Zeppelin.
Those are great bands. What songs do you like from them?
I think their best songs are Enter Sandman, Welcome to the Jungle and Stairway to Heaven.
Have you ever seen them in concert?
I saw Metallica and Guns N Roses together in 1992. I have never seen Led Zeppelin live though.
Me either, I'm too young. That would have been a great experience though don't you think?
Absolutely! I can just imagine them playing Stairway to Heaven and Black Dog live on stage!
Jimmy Page and Robert Plant are some of the best musicians on the planet.
Oh yeah, some of their music is hauntingly beautiful.
Metallica and Guns N Roses were inspired by the sounds of Zeppelin.
Yes, I have heard that. They are a great musical inspiration.
I think Led Zeppelin has inspired a lot of bands and guitarists.
Definitely. They are like the original rock band.
And everyone else followed their lead to make great music.
I agree. I don't know what the world of music would be with Led Zeppelin in it.
Well thankfully we never have to find out.
Nope. Led Zeppelin will be etched in the music world for eternity.
