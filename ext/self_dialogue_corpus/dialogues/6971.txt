Can you believe Disney releasing all its classic animation as live action?
Just a money making ploy.
Gotta be, 'cause their not that good.
I know. I just saw Beauty and the Beast.
I'm sorry.
Thats $20 and 2 hours I'll never get back!
They're doing the Lion King too.
Oh man! Ruining all my favorites.
John Favro is directing.
He did the Jungle Book too.
