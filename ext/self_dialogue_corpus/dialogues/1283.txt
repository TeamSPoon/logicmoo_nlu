Yea, him and Bellichek are one heck of a tandem.
Yea, I agree and I just do not see it changing anytime soon.
I agree! Sometimes age can catch up quick, but I do not know about this one.
Yea, they just build a team around Brady year after year.
Yea, they are the epitome of a team. They just win.
I agree. Hopefully somebody will challenge them in the AFC this year.
Yea, I think Pittsburgh should be able to challenge them.
Are you factoring Bell into that?
Yea, I am, but you never know with that guy.
Yea, he has to learn to stop getting suspended.
I agree! He is way too good to be off the field.
Yea and with Ben Roethlisberger getting older, they could use a nice rushing attack.
Yea, he seems to put himself into harms way too much.
Yea, I agree and as he gets older, he has to stop doing that.
You must admit though, he is a beast and is hard to take down.
Yea, he is a defenders nightmare.
Yea and with an arm like that, he is really amazing.
Yea, having Antonio Brown doesn't hurt either.
Yea, I agree. He is a game changer.
