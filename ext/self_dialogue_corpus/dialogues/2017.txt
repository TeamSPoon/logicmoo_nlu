Did you see that Jamal Adams got drafted by the Jets?
I did. I think he's going to have a great Rookie year.
He was amazing for LSU.
Let's hope that carries over to the NFL
Are there any other rookies you think will be good?
I think Rueben Foster is going to be impressive
Who was he drafted by?
The 49ers.
I always liked the 49ers
Hopefully they'll make it to the playoffs this year.
I think Christian Mcaffery is going to be great too
I think he can help Cam Newton a lot
They could for sure go to the playoffs with the two of them
Mcaffery will be a nightmare to cover.
For sure. Defensively he's a great player
And on offense too.
Seems like everyone has to be great at both these days
For sure. I think Steve Smith did it really well.
He was a beast
And a fighter too.
