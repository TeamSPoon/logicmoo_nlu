I heard that you haven't seen the movie Scarface, is that true?
Nope, I've never seen it!  I actually refuse to watch it.
Why?  It's such a great movie!
I don't know, I just really don't like gangster movies.  It irritates me for society to glorify violence.
well yeah, I can see that, but Al Pacino is so great in it.  I don't think it glorifies anything violent.
How can you say that? The whole movie is about drugs and violence!
How do you know that if you haven't seen it?
Because I've heard that from many people and I've read descriptions of it.
Well, in my opinion it shows the dark side of those things.  You see how much damage it can do in the characters' lives.
Well, I can see that perspective, but I still don't enjoy watching that kind of thing.
Really, you should watch it just to say you've seen it!  It's an American classic.
Well, I have held out this long and I don't plan on changing that anytime soon.
Well fair enough.  At least tell me you've seen the Godfather?
Nope!  I refuse to watch that too.
You gotta be kidding me!  So do you watch anything with violence in it?
Yes I do, but I just try to avoid movies that I think glorify violence and crime.  There's too much of that in society today.
There always has been.  I don't think it's necessarily getting any worse.
I think it definitely is getting worse!
Yeah but it's not the fault of the movies.  The movies are just a reflection of society.
They're supposed to entertain me, and watching others engaging in those behaviors does not entertain me.
