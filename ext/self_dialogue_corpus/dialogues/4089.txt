have you ever seen insomnia?
Yes actually. I am a big robin wiliam's fan.
I see. very different role for him though, no?
He has had a few darker roles like this but few and far between. I liked that Christopher Nolan didn't type cast him or not cast him at all.
Christopher Nolan is such a wise man, he makes such smart choices for his films.
I do love christopher nolan,  But I feel like this is one of his weaker films.
I enjoyed this movie a lot. But I did feel maybe it was slightly long or the pacing could have been faster.
It is weird how some thrillers are so fast paced but others have the long build up and can be equally successful or good.
True, I suppose it is just a different approach to the film and film making process.
If all thrillers were the same they would be predictable and boring.
