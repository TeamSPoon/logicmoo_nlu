Who do you think is the greatest NFL player of all time.
That's a tough question.
For me it is Joe Montana.
Well, he's a top 5 QB for sure but not the best player overall.
Okay so who would you pick.
I would choose Mike Singletary .
That's an intersting selection, why?
Because he was the key to the best NFL defense of all time and arguably the best NFL team of all time.
Hard to argue with that.
Yeah, Buddy Ryan's system was built around his unique abilities.
That was an amazing defense and Payton and McMahon  gave them enough offense.
I think the team that most resembles them would have been the Baltimore Ravens.
The linebacker position is realy key to a great defense.
I agree, but great middle linebackers are rare.
How about best QBs? who is on your top 5 list?
I'll go with Montana, Unitas, Marino, Brady, and Manning.
I can't argue with Brady after last season, but Manning?
I think Manning is a lot like Marino, his best years were on poor teams.
Okay, and your top ever?
Has to be Joe Montana.
