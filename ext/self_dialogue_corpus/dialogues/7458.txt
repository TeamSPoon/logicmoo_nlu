hey do you have a favorite disney movie?
umm yeah i would have to say it is tarzan
oh tarzan was a really good one thats my favortie also
yeah i liked the idea of him being raised by apes
yeah that was really cool, and the love story of meeting jane
yeah they were cute together
i hated the hunter friends of jane though
yeah they were the bad guys but after some conflict they lost in the end
yeah tarzan is so stron and he outsmartedt hem with the help of his friends
exactly his little ape friend and elephant were so comical
