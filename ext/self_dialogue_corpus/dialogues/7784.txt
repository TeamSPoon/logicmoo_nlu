That first Harry Potter movie was amazing.
Yes, I still remember it vividly.
I took my kids to see it and was blown away by it.
I loved the dining hall.
What about the sorting hat.
That was wicked cool!
I liked the characters from the start, especially Hagrid.
Oh yeah, and his little dog. (sarc)
Which one is your favorite?
I still say the first one.
