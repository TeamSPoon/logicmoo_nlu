Have you seen any movies with Emilia Clarke in it?
Yes! I have just watched Me Before You. She's so cute in it!
Yeah! I have seen that movie too. She's such a diverse actress!
Ugh that movie is such a good chick feel. I loved it so much.
Yeah I teared up at the end. It's a real heart jerker.
What other actors are in that movie? I notice Tywin Lanistor in that movie!
Yeah. I looked up his name. His name is Charles Dance.
It's so weird seeing him so caring and actually smile.
Yeah I know in game of thrones he's this mega controlling father figure.
Yup and in this movie he just loves his son so much.
Oh the other actors in this movie are Sam Clafin, Jenna Coleman, and Charles Dance.
OH yeah! I remember seeing Jenna Coleman.
She has such a refined cute beauty to her.
Yeah but compared to Emilia Clarke and her cuteness, there is no match.
Yeah I loved her outfits in the movie
The director and wardrobe people did such a good job.
I loved her little quirky traits and how expressive her eyebrows are.
It's such a fun movie to watch with the whole family
Yup it's PG13 so no real bad scenes
Haha after game of thrones it is a welcome change.
