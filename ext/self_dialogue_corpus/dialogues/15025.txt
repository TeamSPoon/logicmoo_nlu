Is Home Alone the most overrated comedy ever?
It's got to be up there.
Macaulay Culkin never exactly went anywhere.
He was pretty much done after this movie.  Probably made a ton from it.
Makes you wonder if he got a cut of the gross profits.  If so, he has life made.
Yeah, that movie grossed about $20 billion take a billion or so.
You're funny.  It was all the rage back then.
It's the last movie Joe Pesci even did that I can remember.
And they made some sequels for no reason either.
Oh, there was a reason alright.  More money!
