When I was twelve I was in love with Luke Skywalker. You know, Mark Hamill.
You're kidding! I mean, look how old her is now!
Ahem....how old am I? Please I'm talking about the year 1977!
Okay, you were in love with Mark (scoff) Hamill. Tell me more about that.
He was so young, and cute, and had heaps of pretty straight blonde hair, a forked chin, dimples, and the bluest eyes ever....
What about Harrison Ford? Don't tell me he's chopped liver.
No, by no means, but when I was 13, he seemed just a little too mature for me. As I grew up, though...he started looking much more appetizing.
So did you ever meet him? What about conventions and stuff?
I never had the gall to go to cons when he was starring,nor did I have the money. I did see him in Penn Station once, when he was directing a Broadway Play, and I was too scared to speak with him.
Wow, talk about being star-crossed. Maybe Chewbacca is a little more approachable.
