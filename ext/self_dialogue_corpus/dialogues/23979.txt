Have you seen " Dead Men Tell No Tales "?
No, I have not even heard of it, what's it about?
It's the new Pirates of the Carribean Movie.
Oh, I didn't know that was the name. I've been dying to see it.
You really should it was great.
Yea, I love Captain Jack Sparrow.
Me too! I love how well Johnny Depp plays his role
Agreed, he's been fantastic in all of the films, how many are there now?
I believe this was number 5.
And I'm sure there will be a 6.
Hopefully, it ended with some closure but definite room to further elaborate.
I'll have to go see it, I hear Will Turner comes back.
I won't spoil it for you but I will say in my opinion thinws the best movie since the first 2
They did fall short the past couple.
They were all entertaining but 1 and 2 were great. This one is great as well.
Well now I want to go and see it!
Now I want to watch the complete series!
So maybe we can binge watch them all together.
And let me guess go see this one again with you after?!
Of course, you said it's great!
