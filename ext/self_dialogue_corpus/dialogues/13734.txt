What is Lady Gaga up to these days?
I know she has a few new songs out but I haven't heard much from her since the Superbowl.
What are some of her new songs?
One is called A Million Reasons, which I think was played during the Superbowl.  And a newer one if called The Cure.
Wonder why it hasn't been as popular.
Probably because there really isn't any controversy surrounding it.
I wish she would go on tour again.  I haven't seen her perform live yet.
I think she is currently on tour, you can check online for dates.
Wonder how much tickets are?
I would pay a ton of money to go see her perform, she is a great at everything.  I am amazed that she can play piano on top of everything else.
