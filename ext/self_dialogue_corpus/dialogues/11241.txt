Who wore it better on the red carpet, Jessica Findlay or Andie MacDowell?
I personally liked Andie MacDowell's dress better.
I like Jessica's dress better, its more fitted and gives a lot more shape than Andie's dress.
But the black belt on Andie's really ties the whole dress together.
I think the black belt reminds me too much of a kid's dress.
Really? I think its a really good accent and allows the bottom of the dress to flare nicely.
I just like the black straps on Jessica's dress more. I think its a much more subtle statement.
Yea it's nice, but I guess I just like more of a statement. I think belts look more professional
Exactly! This is red carpet not a business ball!
Yea I guess Jessica's dress does look more red carpet and Andie's looks more like a ball gown
I just think Andie's has to much fabric . The bottom looks heavy and plain.
Yea Jessica's dress is more slimming.
It's a more modern style too!
Well she is much younger
That's true, I think both dresses look beautiful given each individual's style, but I personally like Jessica's better
Yea I guess if I was to wear one I would probably wear Jessica's, I think they're both nice though.
They're probably both equally as expensive too
oh definitely! I couldn't wear them even if I wanted to
That scarlet color is really gorgeous and would look great on you though!
Yea I really love the color, it's extremely eye-catching
