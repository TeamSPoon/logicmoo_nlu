I had a dream last night about watching NFL football.
Well that's all we got right now since the season hasn't started.
I'm thinking of trying to go to a game this year.
Where would you go?
I like the Bears, but I'd be open to anywhere really.
You must really want to attend a game.
I do.  I used to have season tickets to the Bears and I miss those Sundays tailgating and going into the game.
That sounds like a fun way to spend a Sunday.
I do enjoy being home too though to watch NFL games.
That NFL Redzone Channel is great to watch parts of all the games.
I know you don't really miss a touchdown on that channel.
Now you're getting me excited to watch my team the Steelers.
I didn't know you were a Steelers fan.
I've liked them for awhile.  I liked Antonio Brown and their running back.
You talking about LeVeon Bell?
Yes I couldn't remember his name.  He is a great runner.
He is very explosive.
Antonio Brown can move too.
Yeah he just runs by defenseive backs and Big Ben drops the ball in.
See why I like the Steelers!
