Did you see the Capitals got knocked out of the playoffs last night?
Yeah, I saw that.  Such a disappointing final game.  I don't know what happened.
Me neither. They played great the past three games and then just lost all desire to win.
Classic Capitals.  The curse continues.
Yeah, it will only get worse too.  We'll be having some pick shakeups next year.
How so?  Players leaving?
Well, we don't know yet, but Oshie, Shattenkirk, Winnik, and quite a few others will probably become free agents.
Oh man. The Caps are going to struggle without Oshie.  I really hope they can put something together again, Ovechkin really needs a cup.
Yeah, but I think he might be part of the problem.  He's very inconsistent in the playoffs.
Yeah, I noticed that he had several games with several points and then other games he did nothing at all.
Oh well.  I'm over it.  As long as the Penguins don't win the cup again.
Who are you cheering for now?
I would say either the Predators or the Senators.
Oh yeah, having the eighth seed win the cup after beating the Blackhawks would be pretty cool.
Yeah, it would.  They seem like good guys, I have no reason not to like them.  But Karlsson in Ottawa has been playing out of his mind.
Oh, definitely, he's the best defenseman in the league right now.
And Craig Anderson's wife having cancer and him missing a significant part of the season..
Yeah, that's such a sad story. Would be a great comeback for the team and him personally.
I think so too. I think his wife is getting better since he decided to come back to the league.
I sure hope so.  A cup won't make up for your losing your wife to cancer.  Fingers crossed for the Senators to take it all.
