What is one thing that bothered you about the Harry Potter movies?
Oh, you already know! Dobby!
Why Dobby, he's so sweet and cute.
No he's not! He's obnoxious, and nearly kills Harry at least two or three times.
Well I think he means well, but just ends up getting in the way, lol.
Well, he does help a bit in the end I guess.
A bit? He saves everyone by apparating into the Malfoy's cellar and saving the day.
True, I guess I overlooked that.
Dude, he DIED as a result. In Harry's arms no less.
You're right, okay, fine I love Dobby now! Now let's talk about Hedwig, the truly useless character!
