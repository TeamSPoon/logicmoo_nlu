Did you go to the game last night between the Padres and Giants?
Yeah, we had seats behind the Giants dugout.
Really?  We were just behind third base!
Oh! Then you almost got hit by that foul ball!
Too close.  That home run in the fifth inning was a monster.
They need to make that right field fence higher.
I agree.  Seems even most pitchers can hit homers over that wall.
Speaking of pitchers, why would the Padres bring someone out of retirement to pitch?
Seems that's their M.O. -- too cheap to buy good talent.
Padres should be a AAA ballclub.
Well, Padres got their new baseball field right smack in downtown San Diego.
Beautiful field it is -- ranks as one of the tops in the league now.
All they need to do now is field a team that can compete in the bigs.
Wouldn't it be great to see a World Series here?
Heck yeah!
I'd love to see the good ol' days of Mark McGuire and Sammy Sosa...
Smackin' balls outta the park and roundin' the bases while fist pumpin' on steroids..
Yeah, those were the days...
Anyway, see you tomorrow at the game?
7pm against the Rockies -- see you there.
