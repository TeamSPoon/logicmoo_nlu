I wanna watch a movie this weekend. Something funny or maybe scary.
What do you wanna see exactly. Funny or scary is a category.
What's popular right now?
Right now? I don't know let's check.
Ok. Check out IMDB
I want to check rottentomatoes first.
I like IMDB better.
Fine, I don't have a preference over a movie review sites, so let's check IMDB. There, you happy?
Yes. Go to the "in the theaters"
i know what I'mm doing. Ok. here we go. Woo! New Pirates movie's opening this weekend! We need to see that movie.
Oh snap. That's gotta be good. Ok Whatelse. Find something funny.
Baywatch... No. i am not watching that stupid movie. And what are all these "limited" things?
They're only opening/showing in limited cities. Ergo, "limited"
Oh. Nevermind that then. What about...
Go to the box office top ten. Those are popular ones.
Woo, new alien movie... i wanna see that. Guardian 2. Eh that's ok.
King Arthur movie seems ok. Oh my God. No. NO Amy Schumer, that's a stupid movie. Skip. Scroll. What about Boss Baby?
We do love our animations, but that seems a bit annoying and didn't rank that high. That's kinda rare for Dreamworks to not rank above 7.5
it's a stupid premise, that's why.
it's a cute baby who's the boss, why is that a stupid premise? Anyway, let's watch the new alien movie. That seems violent and spooky and all around good. makes me feel warm and fuzzy inside with all the alien/human deaths and ghoulish images,.
