Who is the best center fielder of all time?
Mickey Mantle.
I was thinking it'd have to be him or Willie Mays.
You're right, that's a coin flip.
I'd even give the edge to Mays because he was a little better with the glove.
Both were great. Mays had the legs though.
Well, that's a common mistake people make. Mantle was actually the faster of the two, but Mays stole more bases in part to Mantle's injuries.
We can throw Ty Cobb into the mix too.
Another good one.
What about best CF for modern times?
That's a little easier probably.
Maybe have to go with Trout since he's very similar to a modern Mantle.
Trout is a machine, but still early in his career.
Then I think you have to go with Griffey without an argument.
Yeah, you're right I can't think of anyone close to Griff in the past 50 years.
You mean Andy Van Slyke isn't close?
Haha. Good player but noooooo.
Kirby Puckett and Beltran for modern guys, but they're not Griffey.
Always forget about Kirby, if he didn't have the eye thing he might have his numbers would have been even better.
Yeah, that's a shame it got cut short.
