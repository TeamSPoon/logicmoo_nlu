You know what a really good band I haven't heard anything from in a while?
Who?
The band Fun!
Yeah, they were awesome.
Some nights and We are young are two great songs.
Without a doubt.  I wish they'd get something new.
I know, I still listen to those songs.  I bet they're great in concert.
I'd have to look into that.  I've never known anyone to go to one.
They're so energetic though.
Yeah, I know what you mean.  Like at the end of Some Nights.
Yeah, how could they not be great?
Don't forget Carry On.
Oh great song.  I like the way their music is structured.
It sounds so great.  It always has good building to it.
Yeah, a lot of music has two speeds.  Loud, or really loud.
Tell me about it.  Fun has good dynamics though.
They were at Boston Calling a few years ago.
And I missed it?  Awe man, that's always a good concert.
Yeah, I went when they had the Pixies.
You're a lucky guy.
