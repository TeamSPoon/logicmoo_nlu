Have you been on the Frozen ride yet?
Yeah, I thought it was ok but not exactly what I thought.
Who is your favorite "Main" character?
Minnie mouse, well or Daisy.
Here is the biggest one: Animated beauty and the beast or real life.....
Real life by far, I didn't think I would but I fell in love with it.
Have you ever been to Walt Disney World?
Oh yeah, we are actually DVC members.
Whats your favorite park out of the 4?
Honestly, most people hate it but I love Epcot.
