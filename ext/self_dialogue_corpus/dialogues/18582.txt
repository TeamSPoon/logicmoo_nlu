What do you think of Nickelback?
Ah, Nickelback.
Do you think they're deserving of all the hate they get?
Yes and no.
How so?
I don't think they're terrible per se, but they're not great.
I actually think they're not too bad.
There's worse bands out there at least.
I agree.
What made you ask this question?
They just came on the radio haha.
Ha, what song?
"Photographs"
Oh man. Brings me back.
I think the reason people like to hate on them is because hating stuff is popular these days.
You are definitely right about that.
Social media hasn't helped in this, either.
That's for sure.
So here's to me giving Nickelback some due!
Here's to Nickelback!
