I used to have such a crush on Catfish Hunter.
On who?
James Augustus Hunter. A Kansas baseball team gave him the nickname, to increase his folksy allure.
So he was a Kansas sensation.
Actually, he moved with the team to Oakland California, where they became the Oakland Athletics.
Ah. I've heard of the Oakland A's.
Of course you have. I'm surprised you haven't heard of Catfish, a creature of grace and beauty, I'll tell you.
So he had a long and sucessful career with the A's.
Sucessful. Maybe not so long.
Oh? What happened?
After nine years with the A's, I think, he did about five years with the Yankees. I still watched him when I could.
And then he retired, rich and happy?
No, not quite. This isn't one of those happy baseball stories.
What happened, a scandal?
No, a disease or two. First, diabetes.
So he had to quit?
Retire, you mean. Yes, he did. A sad day.
And then he got to watch his grandchildren grow up.
No, then he died of ALS. At about 53, I think.
Huh. Lou Gerig's disease. How sad.
