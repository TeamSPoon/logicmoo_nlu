Did you hear that Lady Gaga teamed up with Starbucks?
Get out! Really? I love Gaga.
Me too. What's your favorite Gaga album?
I guess I'm partial to Artpop.
That's one of her best, for sure.
What about you? What's your favorite album of hers?
I think I'd have to say The Fame.
That's probably her best, now that I think about it.
The Fame made her a star.
Definitely. I agree. That'll be the album she's most remembered for, probably.
