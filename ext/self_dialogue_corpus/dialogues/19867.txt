Hello, what is you favorite types of music?
I mostly like pop and some country, what about you?
I like those two but I also enjoy rap as well.
I am not a big fan of rap besides Eminem.
Yeah he is one of my favorites. What bands do you like?
Well I like Justin Beiber's music even though he is not a good person.
Besides the drama concerning him he does make some good music.
Yeah it gets annoying, what is your favorite band?
I really like bands like Beyonce.
She is older but she is still pretty good.
I love her music, I feel that it has inspired many people.
What other bands have inspired you?
Well I would have to say Daft Punk made me love techno music.
Oh I forgot about that genre I really like techno and electronica.
So do I, It is good to play games and relax too.
What other songs do you think are good to relax too?
I would say any kind of jazz song probably.
I do not like jazz really.
It is okay, reggae is fun to listen too though.
