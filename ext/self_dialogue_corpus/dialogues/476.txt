Do you like football?
Who me?
Yes you, who else?
Of course I like football.
Do you like the game, or the social aspect?
I think I use it as a crutch?
A crutch?
An emotional crutch. I might have a problem.
Oh my, I wasn't ready to get serious.
I drink too much.
Don't say that!
Its not even about the game anymore.
Don't be daft you love football, of course its about the game!
I don't think so, its just about sitting around and forgetting my problems these days.
I can't believe it, I'm so sorry.
Don't be, you helped me admit it.
I wasn't trying to turn this into an intervention.
Well, you succeeded.
I guess I'm happy to help.
This was a real emotional touchdown.
