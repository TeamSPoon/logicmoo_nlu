Did you finally watch the new Star Wars movie?
Yeah, it was a lot better than I thought it would be.
I watched a movie that was pretty good.  It's called My My Blind Brother.
It's about a blind guy?
My My Blind Brother is more about a blind guy's brother and a girl they both like.
Oh, I see.  A romantic comedy...
I watched Logan the other day.  It's pretty good if you like Wolverine.
I do.  I'll have to stream that or something.
If you're into Japanese history and the things monks went through you'll like Silence.
It sounds like it may be cool.  Can you loan me the DVD?
If you liked Saving Private Ryan, you'll like Hacksaw Ridge.
Really?  Hmm.  I'll have to check that out.
Have you seen Hacksaw Ridge yet?
No, but I heard it was a true story.
what is War Dogs about?  I heard it was worth watching.
It supposedly a true story of two guys that did arms dealing with the U.S. government.
My wife wants to she Why Him.  Is it watchable?
Definately, it was pretty funny.
I heard Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them was pretty good.
Yeah, if you're into Harry Potter types of stuff, you'll love it.
