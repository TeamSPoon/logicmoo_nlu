Did you see any streams from Glastonbury?
Yeah, I just watched Katy Perry's set.
What it any good?
I thought she did a really good job, yeah.
Better than you expected?
Far better. She did the whole show live!
Did she just sing the hits?
No, she also performed stuff from Witness.
I haven't even purchased Witness yet.
Neither have I, but I might now.
