What do you think of the Wolverine?
Well, I'd name my child Logan, if I had one.
I guess you like it! Which was your favorite movie?
I don't know; it's hard to say. I think I like the first ones they made, the best.
The ones made in early 2000s?
Yeah - with Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters.
Xavier! I'd forgotten about him. Patrick Stewart's so classy.
Rocking the wheelchair!
I like how he - Xavier - interacted with Logan, as well.
Right - sympathetic but unwavering.
