I hate Herzog.
Hate is a strong word, no?
He's garbo.
He's pretty seriously emotive.
And?
Sentimentality is good, in my opinion.
It's absurdly easy to be him.
What? No.
Mid 50s German men are nothing if not sentimental.
He's still refreshing as a filmmaker.
He's kind of not.
He has capital-t theories written about him.
Most people do.
Not most filmmakers.
I wrote treatments on him.
How were those?
They sucked. I hated them.
Come on.
I had to watch the Iraq thing he did five times.
Jesus.
