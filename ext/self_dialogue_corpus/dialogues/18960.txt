Have you seen the musical Dear Evan Hansen?
No, but I'd like to see it.
I've read a lot about the show.
Did you watch the Tony Awards?
Wouldn't miss it- the lead Ben Platt won best actor in a musical.
They won 6 Tonys, including best musical.
For 23 years old Ben Platt is tremendously accomplished in music.
His voice is great. Did you hear him sing Walking through a Window?
He sang it live at the Tonys and he deserved the standing ovation.
Several of my male voice students are taken with the songs from Evan Hansen.
Can any of them handle the emotion behind the songs?
They're getting there but the music from the show is so relatable to these kids.
It's not easy to sing and cry at the same time.
No, but the musical is set in high school and they're in high school.
Who wrote the music for Dear Evan Hansen?
Benj Pasek & Justin Paul. They won the Tony for Best Original Score too.
I remember them now, a  lot of their songs were on the TV show Smash.
A few of  my students just appeared in the musical James and the Giant Peach-they composed that music too.
Didn't they have something to do with the music from the film musical La La Land?
They sure did.Pasek and Paul wrote the lyrics and Justin Hurwitz wrote the music.
