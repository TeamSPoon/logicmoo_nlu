You know what I think it's funny?
i know what's funny. All the conspiracy theories about the identity of the new characters.
Yep, there was this idiot theory that went around saying Jar Jar Binks is the Plagueis AND the supreme leader Snoke.
That was so stupid. How did they even come with that?
Something about the only Gungan Jedi turning to the dark side at the same time when Jar Jar was in Gungan.
There was a Gungan Jedi?
There were two, actually. Kin-Ya Dosun the master, and his padawan Kin-Ya Hadu who later emerges as a Sith.
And they're saying Jar Jar is Kin-Ya Hadu, and the Sith Lord Plagueis?
Yes, which is why he was able to kill so many of the drone soldiers being as clumsy as he is. That clumsiness is a part of his disguise.
Ok, then that still doesn't explain the Snoke's appearances.
