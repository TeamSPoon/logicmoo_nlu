Why am I able to watch Pulp Fiction so many times in a row?
Because its a really good movie!!!
There are so many good scenes
And the actors are all amazing, Samuel L Jackson was my favorite.
I liked how they had so many storylines but they all fit together.
The very beginning diner scene was well done, and they tied it to the end really well.
John Travolta was also a good part of the movie
I liked how their small conversations were so memorable.
The details of that movie are why its so easy to rewatch.
The action scenes were very well done too.
