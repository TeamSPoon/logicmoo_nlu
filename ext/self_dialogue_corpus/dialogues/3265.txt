What horror movie do you feel is truly original?
I thought Cabin in the woods was a very original take on the horror genre.
I will say the put an interesting twist on archetypal horror film stereotypes.
Well said.i also loved the amount of humor they showed. Truly a fun horror film,
I did also aprreciate the humor found in it.
Chris hemsworth role was kind of flat though.
I barely remember his role at all.
Kristen Connolly's role was much more memorable. But she is less well known in general.
Ya she is less popular but I think a great actress. I liked her in the whispers tv show.
She was a lso in house of cards.. but I like her best in cabin in the woods.
