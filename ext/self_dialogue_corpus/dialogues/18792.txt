I'll have to check it out!
Pvris are releasing a brand new album called, All We Know of Heaven, All We Need of Hell, in August of this year.
That's exciting! I'll give it a listen when it comes out. How do you pronounce the bands name?
Pvris is pronounce "Paris", they changed the spelling due to a copyright problem with the original name.
Well, that makes sense, I like the way it looks better with the "V" as an upside down "A" better anyway. What is your favorite song from the debut album?
My favorite is the song Holy, followed closely by Fire. Though, truly every song on the album is incredible.

I have! The first single, Heaven, sounds like the band has matured well. It is on constant rotation in my favorites playlist.
It sounds like you really like this band. Have you seen them live?
I haven't yet, but will be seeing them in the fall of this year!
Who is in the band?
Lynn Gunn is the lead singer, she also plays rhythm guitar and keybords . Her voice is haunting and beautiful all at once. Alex Babinsk plays lead guitar and keyboards and Brian MacDonald plays bass and keyboards.
They do sound like a band I'd really enjoy. I can't wait to check them out!
You should come to the concert with me in the fall!
Absolutely, let's plan to go to the show together to see Pvris!
