I just saw Krampus over the weekend.  Wasn't that the one you told me about?
The one based at Christmas?  Did you like it?
I thought it would be scarier.  The scares all seemed to come at once and were predictable.
It was a bit slow to start.  It took forever for the elves to take the sister.
What other movie was based in this universe?
Trick R Treat.  That is the with Sam in it.
Ah, right.  What did you think of the ending on this one though?
They left it up to the viewers it seems.  I think they were given another chance.
I thought that too.
It is still a little disturbing being left to wander though.  They could be trapped in a snow globe.
