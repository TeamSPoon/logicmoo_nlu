You like mob movies?
Of course I do.
And your favorite?
Of course it's The Godfather!
Of course. Which one?
Hahahahah,all of them of course.
You're so right. Probably the only movie that's had great sequels.
I know. Most sequels don't come close to the original.
So many great actors and actresses too.
There was a ton of them.
Brando,Pacino,James Caan. To name a few.
How about Robert Duvall,Diane Keaton,Talia Shire.
The list is endless.
It's a very long list.
How about good old Abe Vigoda?
Wow,no kidding. On to Barney Miller as Fish.
He finally did die.
Yes he did.
Can't forget it all happened because of Mario Puzo.
You're exactly right.
