Hey - I can't wait for the new NFL Season - how about you?
Me too - I am a NFL fanatic - its the best sport for sure.
I really love the early fall when it all gets going, the hype, the info everything.
Yes - I am pretty glued to Sportscenter once the season gets underway.
Yeah, Im the same its the only time I watch sports on TV - the NFL season.
Do you ever go to any games at the stadium?
No - if the Broncos came to town I might try to get tickets though
Are they your favorite NFL team?
Yes the Broncos and the Redskins.
Thats funny I love the redskins too, watch as many games as I can.
They are a huge disappointment though every year.
Thats for sure - I still watch though and hope and watch Patriots games too since I live up near Boston now
Well you have one great team there as long as Brady and Bellichek are together!
Yeah - every year its seems they have a shot at the post season playoffs.
I always love watching my Broncos play against them - normally a great game
Yeah those few Brady - Manning games recently were classics.
Yeah the NFL had to love those matchups and what that did for fan attention.
And you know you couldnt find two better representatives of the NFL than those two - Brady and Manning
You think so - despite deflategate. That didnt affect Brady?
No that whole DeflateGate thing was all hype and BS - it happened all the time. The NFL just made a big deal out of it.
