You like Goddard?
At first I didn't get him.
He has a way of creeping up on you, like a persistent cat that ends up on you lap when you didn't want him there and you get distracted and suddenly find it purring on your lap and you don't know how it got there.
It is like that, isn't it.
What's the first thing you saw of his?
WEEKEND. It was like taking drugs.
Remember that scene where the couple is driving past what looked like a 50-car wreck?
Yeah. He established a mood, a sentiment in his films that was unlike anything happening in the U.S.
I remember finally seeing BREATHLESS in college. It was for an existentialism in literature class.
Sounds cool.
The professor saw SO much going on beneath the surface.
Nihilism?
Goddard's character, to a point. But his interpretation of the ending was crazy deep.
When Belmondo gets shot and dies?
Yeah, and he does that Bogart thing with his thumb on his lip.
I remember. It felt deep but I couldn't articulate anything cogent.
The prof interpreted as Dostoevskyian apostolic succession, like in the "Brothers Karamozov."
That IS deep!
I had a crush on his first wife, Anna Karina.
She had something -- very cute -- not flashy Hollywood style.
