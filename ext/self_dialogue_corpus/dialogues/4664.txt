That was an impressive win by the Brewers against the Cubs.
Yeah the Brewers did a great job of taking over that game
That was a tough game to play in with all of the rain
I think Major League Baseball should have probably stopped the game a little sooner
Yeah the conditions were getting a little crazy out there
But to the Brewers' credit, they were resilient and found a way to get the win.
That's what good ball clubs do
I couldn't agree more. I mean it was 46 degrees out there and 37 degrees with the wind chill factored in.
Sounds more like football weather instead of baseball weather
Yeah the game was for almost 2 hours at the top of the 6th inning.
That is a long wait to try and complete a game.
It really is, but the Brewers are looking good. They have won 10 out of their last 12 games.
Yeah they got a great game from Orlando Arcia.
I believe he had 3 hits and a RBI
In contrast the Cubs pitchers were wild.
They walked 10 batters yesterday.
That's not going to win you a lot of games.
Even with that they were in a good position to win until reliever Mike Montgomery blew it.
Yeah he came in and immediately loaded the bases
The Cubs have Arrieta going tomorrow, so maybe they can right the ship.
