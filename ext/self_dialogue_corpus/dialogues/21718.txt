What did you think of the movie, "Interstellar"?
I saw it last year, on the big screen. I went alone, because my husband wasn't into it., and I loved it.
Who was in that? I remember a leading man...
That was Matthew McConaughey. At the time, he was the number one leading man in movies.
At the time? What does that mean?
Well ever since he won an Oscar, and said that "he was his own hero," people have thought him a little crazy.
But he still got a leading man role - how was he in "Interstellar"?
He was fabulous. He had some very demanding moments, like having to cry on camera, and performing as a sort of "stunt pilot astronaut".
Ok, leading men aside, how was the movie itself?
It was really thought-provoking, especially about black holes, and time.
Oh, it was serious science fiction?
Yes, but it did it with a feeling of realism that I haven't seen in a long time. Not since "2001", by Kubrick.
But what about the other actors? I heard Matt Damon was in it.
Yeah, he was pretty good as a bad guy, but the whole "fight out on another planet" was hokey.
Wasn't Anne Hathaway in it?
Yes, she was...the love interest.
You said that with some disgust!
Well, I found her character's innocence, love and destiny theories, and general attitude to be pretty contrite and false.
Oh, gosh, it sounds like she ruined the movie for you.
Not at all. She just "interrupted" the flow of sci-fi. I can handle that.
