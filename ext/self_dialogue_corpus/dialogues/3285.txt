Did you enjoy Scream?
Yes, it was probably the best horror film of the 90's.
I am a big fan of the slasher genre.
Me too. There is so much to like about it.
I like Psycho and Halloween.
Which one do you like best?
I prefer Halloween, just because I saw it first.
Donald Pleasance was great in that film.
Yes and so was Jamie Lee Curtis.
I think Halloween is the best of the slasher genre. But, Scream is definitely up there with Friday the 13th.
