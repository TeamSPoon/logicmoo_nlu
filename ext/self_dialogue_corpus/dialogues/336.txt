Have you seen Doctor Strange yet?
No, I haven't.
Cumberbatch gives an amazing performance!
I'd heard he did a really good job in that and really portrayed the Doctor well.
Oh, he did and was able to maximize the hilarity in some of the more awkward moments.
Hmm, I'd really not considered that there might be funny moments..
What? You act like you've never seen a Marvel movie before!
True, true. I should have considered that they always have those tongue-in-cheek or nerdy moments.
Yes you should have, you filthy casual.
Haha! Don't worry, I will redeem myself by watching Doctor Strange tonight.
