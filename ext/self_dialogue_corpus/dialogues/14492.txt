No I didn't, who was playing this weekend?
The Warriors against the San Antonio Spurs played last night, it was a great game.
Really, what was the score?
The Warriors pulled out a win, 120-108.  it was really well played.
Nice, I like games leek that, close but not too close!
David Lee injured his knee, he had to be taken out for that injury.
Ouch, I will have to watch the replay on that one.
Yeah , he won't be playing in the Western conference finals.
Wow, I can't beleive anotehr player of theirs was taken out due to injury.
They had to take him off the court in a wheel chair
I am sure he was pretty ticked.
Kevin Durant was a strong player in this game.
How well did he do?
Kevin scored thirty-three total points in this game.
He sounds like an MVP player of the game.
He was outstanding to watch, the heat didn't seem to get to him, he remained calm in the game.
I will go home and see if I can find anything online with some replays!
You should, it was really fun to watch.  Are you going to come over tomorrow night to watch more?
Yeah sure, sounds great.  See you then.
