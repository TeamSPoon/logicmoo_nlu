I am so bored right now!
Me to, how about we watch a movie?
That could be fun, do you have any thrillers?
I sure do!! Have you seen Kiss The Girls?
Sounds familiar, who is in it?
It stars Ashley Judd and Morgan Freeman.
I have wanted to watch that one for a while now!
It is a great thriller that will keep you guessing.
I started to watch it a long time ago but something came up.
I can not wait to see what you think about it!
