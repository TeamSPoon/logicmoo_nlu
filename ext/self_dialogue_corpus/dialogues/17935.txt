Do you remember Pat Benatar?
I do, I used to listen to her all the time.
I did too, I just turned on the radio and Shadows Of The Night was on.
That was one of my favorites.
Mine too, I used to really like Cyndi Lauper too.
Her song Time After Time was really good.
Yes it was.
My best friend and I love the song Girls Just Wanna Have Fun.
That is a good song, who sings it again?
Cyndi Lauper sings that song also.
Do you remember the Go-Go's?
I do, Our Lips Our Sealed was a great song.
It was, would you like to hear a funny story about them?
Sure.
My father used to work at an airport in L.A. back when they were big.
Did he ever see them?
Yes actually, he used to have lunch and coffee with them a lot.
No way really?
Yes he said Belinda Carlisle is really nice.
That is really cool.
