Which Aladdin movie was your favorite?
I loved the one with the forty thieves.
That was my favorite too.
How shocked were you that that guy was his father?
Honestly I had no idea that was coming, but afterwards I could see the resemblance.
They did look alike a little.
I was glued to the TV when they went to the hideout the first time.
The number of times I've said "Open Sesame" in my life is incalculable.
Same here, I sing the song all the time.
I keep making up my own words for it, it's so much fun.
