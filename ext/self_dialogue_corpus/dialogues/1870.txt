What do you think was the best TD in NFL history?
The Packers wide receiver Max McGee back in 1967.
Whoa!! You went way back with that one.
Yeah I did. But he did a one hander in 37 yards. I never seen nothing like that since then.
No I think when Odell Beckham Jr made a TD with 21 yards. No that was a TD!!
I remember that. That was actually a few recent years ago.
Yeah it was actually back in 2015 when his team played against the Redskins.
You sure it was 21 yards?
Oh course it was. He is one of my favorite player so I certain it was 21 yards.
Oh ok. But I got one even better than Odell.
Oh yeah. Tell me about it.
Do you remember when AJ Green of the Bengals did a TD with 48 yards?
No I actually don't remember that one.
Yeah it was incredible.
But I do remember when he scored an 80 yard TD when they played against the Ravens.
No that TD was even better. Now I did watch that game.
Yeah and the 66 yard TD when AJ Green played against the Steelers.
I think I almost pissed in my pants during that game out of excitement.
I was watching it at a friends home and it was the highlight of the night.
Now I can agree with you on that one. AJ Green is one of the best WR of the NFL.
