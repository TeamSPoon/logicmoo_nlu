Have you seen the new beauty and the beast?
the more human, non cartoon one?
yes, with emma watson
I have.  I thought it was a little scary to be honest for my kids
How old are your kids again, and was it more beast they were afraid of
6 and 4.  and yes, it was beast and how aggressive and mean he was
right, I usually don't see a lot of that in disney films outside of the villians
that's what I was thinking while watching it.  and the cgi was okay, some were not good
oh really, you felt the movie looked not smooth
right, there were scenes with belle and the candlesticks that were not smooth
