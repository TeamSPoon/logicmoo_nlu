Hey Jodie!
Hi Grover!
What do you think of the B52's?
The B52's? You mean the airplanes?
No, silly! The rock band...
Oh, them...I don't remember them.
They are a new wave band, most popular in the 70's and 80's.
Grover, I was born in the 90's! How am I supposed to remember them?
You remember Elvis don't you?
Well, of course I do! But he was THE KING!
I'll grant yo that, but the B52's were famous too.
Just because somebody is famous doesn't mean EVERYBODY knows who they are.
That's what famous means!
OK. If that's true, then tell me who invented the thumb tack.
What? What does a thumb tack have to do with Elvis?
They are both famous.
You make no sense.  Let's get back to talking about the B52's.
Ok. Name any of their hits.
"Love Shack" was very popular.
Well, I don't know that song, but there is one thing I do know. If you need a sharp object to stick through paper, then thumb tacks are the popular choice.
