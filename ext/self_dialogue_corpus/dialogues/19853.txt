What are your feelings on Pink Floyd?
I know it's cliche but I love them
Me too, and not just their hits
Yeah, I mean Dark Side of the Moon and Wish You Were Here are great, but they were so much more of that
What's your favorite Floyd Album?
I really like Obscured by Clouds. It came out in 1972, a year before Dark Side of the Moon
What's so great about it?
It's just so underappreciated. It gets lost because it came between Dark Side, and Meddle, not that many people now about it
Right, but what makes it so good?
I think it's where Pink Floyd really found their sound, you know
The long guitar riffs, and the Psychedelic sounds you mean
Yes exactly. Up until then they were still trying to find an identity
Yeah, I can see that
Yeah, their first singer Syd Barrett left the Band, and Roger Waters slowly started to take over
I see what you're saying. So a new singer and songwriter
Right. Waters was involved in prior efforts, but Obscured by Clouds is where he really took lead stage
That's interesting, I never thought about it that way
Yeah, it's not coincidence that Dark Side was released right afterwards and they really hit their stride
I see what you're saying
Definitely check it out. It's the first real Floyd album
