I was an adult when I finally seen Harry Potter.
What did you think of the movies?
To be honest, I thought they made no sense.
What! How do you think that?
All the adults are insane. Especially the old wizard, principal guy.
Are you referring to the great Albus Dumbledore?
Yes, old wizard guy. He was an awful person. I mean he sent the kids into the forbidden woods. To pretty much die.
It was like detention.
Right, but more or less alone, with no help. They could have been killed at any moment.
But, he was the best head master. He loved Harry as a son.
