Soon enough the 2017 NFL season will start!
Are you going to get a jump on it and go down to Mankato for the Vikings training camp?
I never thought about it.
You should, I'm not even a fan but I hear it's fun.
You know anyone who has gone?
Yes, I have a friend who goes every year.
Does he like it?
Yes. Tickets are so expensive now that the only way to see the players play for free is at training camp.
That makes sense.
Plus, you can get close enough to ask for a selfie or autograph.
Now I have to go!
Yeah, he takes his nephew and the neighbor kid along so they can see their favorite players.
Are they big NFL fans?
Yes, Of course they both want to be professional football players when they grow up.
So did I.
Of course they won't make it.
You never know. Remember you know some pro players since you were young before they made it and you didn't think they would make it either.
That's true. Even after they made it I look back to when they were saying one day they'd be pro football players and I STILL don't think they'll make it.
So cynical.
Yes, I am.
