Do you know of any good music right now?
I really like Chainsmokers
I have heard of that band, what do they sing?
They sing Closer, it's that really catchy song always on the radio
I know, it's always on! Sometimes too much!
Yeah, but you should check them out they have lots of good stuff
What are some other good songs?
I really like Let You Go, it's even catchier than Closer
Wow, I will be sure to check them out!
So what do you like to listen to on the radio?
I really 21 Pilots, they are my favorite as of 2 years ago!
What do they sing?
They sing Stressed Out, you've probably heard it!
How does the chorus go?
He says "My name's blurryface and I care what you think"
Oh yeah, I know it now! That song makes me want to be a kid again!
Have you seen the music video?
Nope, is it good?
Yeah, they are riding big wheels around and you get to see them play drums and guitar too
I really want to see them live but for now the music video will have to be enough!
