Did you see the last game between the Pittsburgh Penguins and the Washington Capitols?
I was really excited! I was rooting for the Caps.
Me too!  They came back from being behind 3-1 in the series to having it tied up 3-3.
I was so hoping they would win that last game and go on to the Conference finals.
Yeah, they haven't brought home the cup since they came to Washington.
It's still exciting to have hockey here in the Nation's Capitol.
Duh - don't you think that's why they are called the Capitols?
Duh!  Of course.  So nice to be a new team and be able to pick a name and everything.
Yeah, I like the new team in Las Vegas.  What are they called?
The Golden Knights.  How appropriate for a team in Vegas.
Did they get some good players?
Just two.  I can't remember their names right now.
Hey, did you see how Backstrom played in the series?
He has really improved this year.
My other favorite thing was the overtime.
But there was only one in this series.  You know I really love to see a bunch.
Yeah, I know it's both of our favorite parts of the game.
Are you going to watch the rest of the playoffs?
Probably not until the Stanley Cup finals.  Who do you think will win the cup?
I don't know.  It's not as much fun without O-V.
