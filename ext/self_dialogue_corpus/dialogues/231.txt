You know something funny about Superman?
What?
The fact that this superhuman hero is a dark haired male when the Nazis were coming into power in Germany.
Did Germans have access to American comic books?
Yes and no. The Nazis banned comic books in 1933. And the SS took it very negatively that the creator of Superman was a jew.
Superman was created by a jew? That makes sense that he has dark hair then.
Yes, and quite ironic given the timing and what was going on in Germany
Indeed.
The first Superman film was back in 1948, acted by an unknown actor at the time, Kirk Alyn.
I wish I could see that movie.
