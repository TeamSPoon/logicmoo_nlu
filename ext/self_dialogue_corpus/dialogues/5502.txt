So, I have a confession.
Alright, I'm ready for it.
I cried during Inside Out.
I knew it!  I did too though.
It was just real sad because they were actual human characters going through normal human things.
Moving to another city is hard.
Plus being picked and feeling isolated.  That's why it was so effective.
The ending was wrapped up really nicely.
I loved the emotions!  Especially Joy.
Agreed.  I could use more Joy in my life!
