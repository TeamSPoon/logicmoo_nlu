Do you remember the Rancor from Return of the Jedi?
Yeah. That creature was terrifying. Where do you suppose Jabba got it?
I think that guard who was sad that it was killed raised it from a baby.
How did that guy get a baby Rancor?
Maybe he found it in a nest?
Do Rancors have nests?
I'm not sure. How else would a mama Rancor raise its offspring?
Just have it follow her around, maybe?
I wonder what Rancor meat tastes like.
Chicken, probably.
