What kind of thrillers do you like best?
I love Alfred Hitchcock movies. They are classic nail-biting, squirm in your seat suspense masterpieces.
Do you have a favorite Hitchcock film?
I can't get down to one favorite, because he has done so many films that I love.
Tell me about one of your favorites, then.
To Catch a Thief with Cary Grant and Gracy Kelly is a sparkling combination of suspense and romance, thriller and comedy.
Cary Grant and Hitchcock made several films together, didn't they?
All great, classic thrillers. To Catch a Thief is about an ex-jewel thief who is suspected of being behind a current rash of jewel thefts in France.
But there's romance too, right?
Grace Kelly is one of the people who think Grant is guilty. The ending is a real nail biter, with Grant trying to finger the thief as the police try to shoot him!
