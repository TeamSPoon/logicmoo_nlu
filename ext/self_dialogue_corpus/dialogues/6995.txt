Tomorrowland was a great movie.
I liked it as well. I thought the acting by George Cloony and Hugh Laurie was great.
Yes Hugh played the villain perfectly.
The little boy who played Cloony as a child easily could have passed as him.
Yes it was definitely cast well.
And the little girl who was the robot was fantastic. She had a great personality and was so athletic.
I loved the depiction of Tomorrowland as an actual place.
Yes it was a place that I wish was real.
I have a Tomorrowland button and sometimes I touch it to see if something happens.
Ha ha! I do the same. Nothing ever happens though sadly.
