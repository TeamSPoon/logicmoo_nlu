Are you excited for Despicable Me 3?
No, not really.
Why not? I thought you loved the first two.
I do! They're great.
So what's the issue?
The first trailer was awful, and I have no idea what it's supposed to be about.
It's his long-lost brother.
Let me guess...also a villain?
Yup!
Yawn.
What?
Boring, predictable, done to death.
You need to chill.
Are the minions still in it?
Yes!
At least they are! They're adorable!
I want my own minion.
Me too; bananas are cheap here.
Want to see it when it comes out?
Sure. If you pay.
