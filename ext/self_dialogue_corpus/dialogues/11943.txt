I went to this trivia night at a local bar two nights ago. It was a lot  of fun.
So did you do well? Did you win anything?
Yes our table did very well. I couldn't believe then questions about The Beatles that stumped people.
Like what? How hard could it have been?
They didn't know any of the wives names of any of them. The question was name 2 of The Beatles wives.
And not many of them knew? Or did any of them know?
No one knew except our table. These younger people don't know what music is anymore.
Let's see if I can do it. Barbara Bach, Yoko, Linda,who else?
You did well. Each of them I believe had at least two.
How could anyone forget Yoko. She was the one who was accused of breaking up the band.
