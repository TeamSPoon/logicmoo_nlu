Is there a worse divison in the NFL than the AFC South?
I don't know, that'd be hard to beat.
The Texans somehow went 9-7 to win the division last year, but they were awful.
Yeah, and the Titans were even worse, but somehow they also went 9-7.
The Colts might be better, but they haven't given Andrew Luck any help at all and should be lucky to finish .500 this year.
And the Jaguars are the Jaguars - that is to say, bad.
No doubt. Whoever wins this division figures to be a first-round playoff elimination.
Yeah. Same could be said of whoever wins the NFC West.
True. The Seahawks win every year, but their 10-5-1 record was inflated last year by playing three lousy teams twice each.
Yeah, the Cardinals are OK, I guess, but the Rams and 49ers just are putrid.
Yep. Neither team should match its win total from last season, and they were two of the NFL's worst teams last year.
The Niners won two games - and they could be WORSE this season if that's possible.
Very true. Who the heck will play quarterback?
I don't know, but they let Colin Kaepernick go so it doesn't look good.
Can't see any Super Bowl contenders coming from either division.
I think you're right. These division winners will get little more than participation trophies.
The AFC South is a bunch of middling teams beating up on each other.
Yep, and the NFC West is one slightly above average team feasting on a bunch of bad teams.
I suppose it gives each team something of a shot, though, unlike the AFC East.
Yeah, but none of those teams is going anywhere.
