Do you know the movie Friday?
Is that the one with Ice Cube?
Yes, where he gets fired from his job and a drug dealer wants to kill him.
That movie is hilarious. Its one of my favorite comedy movies of all time.
I really like it too. Its a great stoner flick.
Ice Cube has done so much in his lifetime.
I know right, from being a great rapper to being a movie star.
Did you ever listen to his old school rap music?
Of course I have, who hasn't?
Haha, good point. I love his music.
