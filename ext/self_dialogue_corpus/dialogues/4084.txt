You know what I haven't seen in a long time?
What's that?
A really good Thriller film, it's literally been years since I can recall seeing a good one.
Oh, you should see Split. It's one of those M. Night Shyamalan films. Really trippy.
Oh Yeah what's it about?
Well not to spoil it. The story is about a man that has 23 different personalities.
That doesn't sound too interesting, what is the appeal of the movie?
Well the guy kidnaps three teenagers and sacrafices them to one of his personalities which happens to be "supehuman"
That sounds very strange. Now I want to see it just to make sense of what you said.
It's pretty good, I thought it was one of the best thrillers of 2016, it really plays on your mind.
