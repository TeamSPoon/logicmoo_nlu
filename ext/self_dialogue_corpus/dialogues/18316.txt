Have you heard that Reggaton song with Justin Bieber?
Yeah I have. What do you think about it?
I think it's different but a good different.
I think the same. I feel like Justin Bieber with Daddy Yankee and Luis Fonsi make a good combo!
Do you know what the song is called?
Yeah it's called Despacito, and it is topping the charts everywhere!
So I've heard! Justin Bieber is stepping over so many milestones.
He is! I don't think there has every been an artist who has pushed themselves to reach new goals.
Neither can I. I can only imagine how hard it was for him to learn how to speak Spanish so fluently for the song.
I know it must have been hard, it's not an easy language to learn.
The crazy thing is that they are playing a reggaton song on pop radio stations.
That is different not a lot of musicians can jump from different genres successfully.
For being Canadian Justin Bieber has overcome a lot especially trying to make it big in the United States.
I agree, it's hard enough for American born musicians to make it big but Justin Bieber has been winning since he was like 13.
His song "baby" and "somebody to love" and "one time" were all big hits.
He has collaborated with so many famous people like Ludacris, Big Sean, and Nicki Minaj.
That is crazy I think the last person to do that when they were young was probably Usher.
Apparently Usher is his mentor.
That makes sense since he is pretty successful.
That makes me want to download all of his albums.
