What was the best Super Bowl you ever saw?
This years!  Without a doubt.
I agree.  The Pats comeback was pure gold.
No kidding.  I've never seen anything like that.
Yeah, first and only Superbowl to go into overtime.
Yeah, and that drive to get to the goal line was great.
I think we can all now admit that Brady is the greatest of all time.
Yeah, he's top three or four in numbers, and king of the rings.
Yeah, so glad I'm a Pats fan.
We are blessed here in New England.
Although not when it comes to weather.
But surely when it comes to football.
Yes, best coach, and best quarterback in history.
Yeah, and how good Jimmy G is as a backup is awesome.
Yeah, the winning will just continue.
Can't wait for next year, Pats have gotten even better.
Which has to be scary for the rest of the NFL.
I know, how mad is Goodell right now?
He has to be fuming.
I can't wait for the repeat.
