Who do you think will win MVP this year?
It's got to be Westbrook.
I agree. I never thought I'd see a player average a triple double.
Let alone a point guard.
It'll be a crime if he doesn't win.
But his team wasn't as good as other teams.
That's the only argument Harden has. His team was better. And he didn't have much help.
But his season wasn't historic. And he wasn't the best player in the league this year.
His team's record would argue otherwise.
It was a great year for many athletes. You could make a case for Lebron or Kawhi. But all are second to Westbrook.
I think Kawhi should get votes because of his defense. None of the other guys care about defense.
Yeah, from a true fan's perspective, we should award guys that at least try on defense.
Westbrook doesn't try.
I know. He spends all his energy on offense.
It's a shame because Westbrook should be really good at defense.
Anyone with athleticism should be good. It's all about effort.
I hate knowing that some players don't put out 100% effort on the court.
That's why I'd never vote for Lebron.
He doesn't start trying until the playoffs.
But once the playoffs start, there's nobody better.
