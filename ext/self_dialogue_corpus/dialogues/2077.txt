Hey can you believe it's already almost football season again?
Yeah it seems like it just finished yesterday.
How do you think the Redskins are going to do this year?
I don't know, the NFC East looks tough.
Yeah, but you never really know.
The Giants just got Brandon Marshall. On top of Odell? That WR group is nasty.
Sure, but Eli? Does he have anything left in the tank?
He just needs to be adequate. Just throw the ball up and those WRs will come down with it.
Yeah, but the Redskins defense looks improved.
I don't know man, the Redskins? Really?
Kirk Cousins is for real.
Are they even going to pay him? And who is he going to throw to? Didn't DeSean Jackson go to the Bucs?
Yeah, true. And Pierre Garcon went to San Francisco.
See? That team will be lucky to win six games.
I guess you're right. Plus Dallas has Dak and Zeke.
And Philly.
And Philly.
You think Carson Wentz is for real?
I think so. They also got that WR from Chicago this offseason. What was his name again?
Jeffrey?
