Have you seen Sausage Party yet?
Isn't that Seth Rogan's new one?
Yeah, I just saw it again for the 3rd time.
Is it that good?
You have to see it; it's one of his best yet. It's like Zack and Miri make a porno meets Toy Story.
That is a very messed up comparison.
It's a very messed up movie, but does he do any other kind?
That is true, what are they doing though?
It's the story of a lone sausage trying to save his fellow foods from human subjugation.
That actually sounds pretty sweet.
They live in this huge Supermarket and before they can make it to the register there is a collision and they are released from there packages.
I would freak if my food started moving.
You would not be alone in that my friend. The first guy that sees them moving almost has a heart attack; of course the drugs didn't help.
Do they ever?
Well the guy was tripping on bath salts when little Barry the sausage starts talking to him.
That will definitively  make for a bad trip.
You're telling me; they actually end up killing the guy and stealing his car.
That is just insane.
Oh trust me that is not even the start of the insanity in this movie?
Okay I get it; it's an amazing movie. Can we stop talking and just go watch it now?
