You know what song I heard today?
No, what?
I heard Fly like an Eagle by the Steve Miller Band.
Wow, I haven't heard that song in ages.
I know, I was listening to a satellite station that must have been a 70's music station.
Really?
Yeah, it got me thinking.  I think the 70's was the best decade of music.
I don't know.
Think about it, it was such an eclectic time in music.  You had rock with Led Zepplin, Aerosmith and others.
True
Also, there were the singer/songwriters with Jim Croce, James Taylor, Joni Mitchell and others.
I know, they had some classic songs from that decade.
Then, you had the disco stuff.
Yeah, disco really isn't my thing but you're right.
And on top of that, all of the punk bands.  The sex pistols alone were incredible.
Oh I love them.
I just think it was the best decade.
You have a point.
Don't get me wrong, there has been loads of good music since but for a decade, it was the best.
I think so too.
