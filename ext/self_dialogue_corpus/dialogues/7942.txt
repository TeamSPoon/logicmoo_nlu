Do we have to listen to pop? I hate all this auto tune.
So do I actually.
I feel like the artists should be able to sing without it or just don't bother.
Right. It wasn't always a thing so they obviously could at one point.
It would make music so much more believable. Now pop is a joke.
It kind of is. Everyone knows it's more about looks.
Yep, pritty girls and hot guys get to be stars even with zero talent.
I haven't liked pop since the 90's.
They weren't really using auto tune then. It just started being a thing.
It became rampant right around 2000.
