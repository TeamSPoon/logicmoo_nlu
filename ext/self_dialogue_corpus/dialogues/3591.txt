What is your favorite Jason Voorhees movie?
That is a tough one, but I liked Freddy vs. Jason.
That movie also starred Kelly Rowland from Destiny's Child.
Of course the best actor from this movie is Robert Englund.
The original Freddy Krueger.  I'm so glad he came back for this movie.
Me too.  He has a humor and twist that is hard for another actor to duplicate.
Freddy made a big mistake resurrecting Jason though.
He was definitely over confident in his ability to be able to control him.
That was an epic fight scene at Camp Crystal Lake.
I would love to see a sequel adding in other horror movie villains.  Michael Myers maybe?
