Have you seen the Star Wars prequels?
Yes, I liked episode one a lot.
What about Jar Jar Binks?
I think people are too hard on him.
Why you say that/
Well, he is brave and stands up even when he is scared.
Who do you think is the Jar Jar of the new ones.
The silly comic relief?
Yes, I think BB8.
I would have to go with Finn, but he is important to the plot.
