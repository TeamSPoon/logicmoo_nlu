Have you seen the latest Guardian's of the Galaxy movie?
I did and found it was just great.
Do you think the sequel is better or the first movie?
I actually prefer the sequel as more is explained and I like Baby Groot.
What superhero movies are you looking forward to?
I actually really want to see the new Transformers film.
I do too, and am also looking forward to the next Spiderman film.
I wonder what it would be like to have a mixture of Spiderman and Ironman in the same film.
I do to, I think this will be very interesting indeed.
I wonder if this Peter Parker will be better than the other actor portrayals.
