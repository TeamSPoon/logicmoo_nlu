What is the most recent song you heard?
I listened to "I want to break free."
I'm not familiar with that song.  Who sings it?
It's a Queen song.  It was used in a movie.
Which one?
Breaking Away.  I think it was an old 80s movie.  I saw it on TV.
Did you hear the song on the radio?
No, it was on CD.  I used to have the song in my itunes but it disappeared.
Do you mainly listen to music on CD or radio or mp3?
It depends.  Nowadays I spend so little time in the car, I don't listen to a lot of music at all.
When I was younger, music was so important to me.  But as I get older, I kind of appreciate the silence.
The sound of silence.  That's a line from an old song.
Which one?
I'm not sure.  It's the one that starts out, "hello darkness my old friend."
I heard that song in the Trolls movie.
Ha, is that how you get your music?
I like that movie.  It was like an animated musical.
Kind of like the sing movie?
Yes, but I liked the story of Trolls much better.
I'll have to look into that.
