What do you think about Return of the Jedi?
Well, it's better than the prequels, that's for sure.
It's not as good as the other original trilogy movies?
That's right. It's not quite there.
Why? Is it something about originality?
Mostly that's it. It's far more recycled than the others.
The death star narrative repeating itself?
That's part of it. The end game between Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader was also predictable.
You thought Vader being redeemed was predictable?
Yes, it was hinted at. But Luke defeating Vader and killing the Emperor was obvious.
