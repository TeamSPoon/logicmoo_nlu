I saw this wild movie about a group of soldiers fighting werewolves the other day.
What was it called?
Dog Soldiers. Have you seen it before?
I don't think I have. Who was in it?
Sean Pertwee.
You mean Alfred from Gotham? Sweet. Who's he playing in that movie?
A sergeant. The movie is set in a forest in Scotland.
Oh, so it's a foreign film?
Yeah, but everyone speaks English. No worries.
What are the soldiers doing in the forest? Hunting werewolves?
No, they were kind of set up.
Oh, by who?
Do you want me to tell you the whole movie?
Nah, it sounds interesting. Is it playing soon?
Dude, I have the DVD. Dog Soldiers was filmed in 2002.
Why am I just not hearing about it?
I saw it at a friend's house the other day. I saw Sean Pertwee in it and had to pick it up.
Does his character die?
I'm not spoiling it for you. Come watch it with me.
Sounds good. I love werewolf movies.
