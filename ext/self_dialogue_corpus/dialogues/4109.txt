The movie 16 Blocks was crazy.
I know! I just caught that on TV a few months ago.
I thought the plot was a bit ridiculous. I mean, how many people could have wanted to kill that convict guy?
Apparently a lot, if it caused Bruce Willis so much grief to get him 16 blocks to court.
That hostage scene on the bus in that movie was a bit too intense for me. I was worried something bad would happen.
Yeah, that movie had a few moments where Iw wasn't sure if people would make it out alive.
Fortunately, the movie had a happy ending.
I know! I loved the birthday scene.
Me too. I feel like they haven't made many movies like that one recently.
I agree. I wish they would!
