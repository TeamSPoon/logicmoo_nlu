I heard they are going to make a live-action Lion King movie!
Oh not another one those!
What, you aren't a big fan of those live action remakes?
I don't know... every time I watch them I prefer the original ones, not to discredit the films.
Well I heard they are going to reprise the voice actor for Mufasa!
Ok, that does sound pretty cool! What about the songs?
I'm not too sure, the original ones are so iconic, I dont think the studios would want to mess that up!
They had them in the new Beauty and the Beast adaptation?
Yah those songs were fine but they just don't speak to me like the original.
I agree, maybe thisi adaptation will do something different.
