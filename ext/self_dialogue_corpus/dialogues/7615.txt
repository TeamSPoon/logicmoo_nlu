So I'm watching Harry Potter and The Order of the Phoenix and I think this is the saddest one out of all the movies.
Of course it is! I'm still not over Sirius Black getting killed.
I know! Bellatrix LeStrange is one of the best villains of our generation.
She really is, and Helena Bonham Carter is really excellent at being scary and creepy.
I wish they had let Tim Burton direct one of the movies! I think he would have brought them to an entirely new level.
Yes, he really has an eye for the fantastic. He would have been perfect to direct Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire.
Absolutely! I feel like the merpeople and the blast ended skrewts would have been amazing under him.
Now I'm thinking about how poor Cedric Diggory died.
Poor Cedric! He just wanted to win something for Hufflepuff!
Yeah, Hufflepuff never got any kind of glory. Sad little badgers, they never won anything.
