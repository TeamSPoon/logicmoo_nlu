What is your absolute favorite movie?
I think Beauty and the Beast is my favorite.
The new one?
No, the cartoon.  Something about it just feels magical.
It is my favorite Disney movie.
What's your favorite movie in general?
I think my favorite is The Sound of Music.
Really?  Other than cartoons and stuff I can never get into musicals.
I love musicals.  I really liked Phantom of the Opera.
I heard the movie wasn't good in comparison to the one on Broadway.
Really?  I loved it.  I thought Emmy Rossum did an excellent job.
Wasn't Gerard Butler the Phantom?
Yes he was.  He isn't the greatest singer but it wasn't awful.
I recently watched London Has Fallen with him in it.  It was pretty cheesy.
I saw that didn't get very good reviews.
The last good movie he was in was probably 300.
I really liked that movie but I thought the sequel wasn't great.
I did like that it had Eva Green in it.  She should be in more stuff.
She is a great actress, really pretty too.
She was just in Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children.  That movie was pretty good.
