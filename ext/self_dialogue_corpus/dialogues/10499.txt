Hey how are things going for you today?
Pretty good, how about you?
Things are good, just enjoying the early days of summer
Yeah, me too
Seen any good movies lately?
Not, really, how about you?
I saw the new Pirates of the Caribbean movie?
Oh yeah, how was that?
It was horrible
Really?! I thought it would be pretty good.
No, it was bad. Disney needs to kill that franchise
Yeah, I suppose it's become a little worn.
Oh yeah, Johnny Depp's character is way over kill now.
Yeah, they've milked that character pretty good now.
I remember when the first one came out.
Yeah, what year was that?
2003. A while back now
Wow, that was a while ago.
Yeah, but I guess the new one is still making money.
Oh for sure
