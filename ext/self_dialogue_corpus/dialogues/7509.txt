What did you think of The Prisoner of Azkaban?
I thought it was pretty cool to start putting things like werewolves in there.
I know, too bad for that Professor Lupin though.  He was awesome.
Yeah, very powerful and pretty good with the kids as well.  He would have taught them well.
I didn't expect Scabbers to be Peter Petigrew the whole time.
I know, how fitting he was a rat.
Also that Serious Black was a good guy.  They put some good plot twist in there.
I agree, he's a good character too.
One of the best ones.  And best friends with Harry's father.
Yeah, him, Lupin, and that rat Peter.  I hate him.
