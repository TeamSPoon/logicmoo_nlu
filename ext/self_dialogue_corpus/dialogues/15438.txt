What type of music do you like best to workout?
I find techno really pumps me up. what about you?
I sometimes listen to techno but prefer classical for workouts.
Really? That seems odd, don't you want something with a  lot of base to help you feel energetic?
I often find I want a gentle calming feeling. I think I feel worked up while at the gym or maybe to self aware and the classical helps soothe me.
I never thought of using it in a workout situation, Maybe I will try it.
It may work for you. If you want a serene feeling otherwise techno will be better for energizing.
I love my deadmaus 5 , ghosts n other things for workouts. what classical songs do you use?
I like vivaldi's 4 seasons. i can time my workout to match the changes in movements fairly accurately.
Interesting. I had heard listening to classical music before a test helps you retain information and helps one concentrate easier.
Well I have always loved classical in general and have study to it and performed well.
I can only imagine what metal or something really hard core would do.
Probably drive you to rip up your book. But hey you never know what works for one may be poisin to another.
True, let's hope I make it out okay if I try your classical workout music.
I am sure you will be just fine. I think I will check out techno again too but maybe for cardio only.
There is this whole workout routine done in time to music nto zumba, but some name similar and it is essentially timed music for specific workouts, you may like that a lot.
Ah yes Tabata. I had heard of it before. Kind of interesting. But I enjoy longer tracks. I like to get lost in the music.
I suppose with tabata the music makes you focus more on the imed motions.
I think so, I will stick to my seasons , but appreciate the suggestion it is line with my style somewhat.
No problem at all. Vivaldi here I come!
