Are you excited for the new Star Wars movie? I think it's coming out around Christmas.
I am! I really excited to see Luke Skywalker train Rei.
I heard the movie is called "The Last Jedi". I wonder what that means.
Hmm. Maybe Rei will be the last Jedi because she will return balance to the force.
I was actually wondering if Kylo Ren will turn out to be the last Jedi.
I hadn't considered that. He seems like such a dark character, almost beyond redemption.
That's true, but so did Darth Vader. If Kylo Ren really wants to be like Vader, he will need to return to the light.
I really wonder if Kylo is related to Rei in some way.
It's possible. I actually think that Rei is related to Obi-Wan somehow.
That would make sense, too.
