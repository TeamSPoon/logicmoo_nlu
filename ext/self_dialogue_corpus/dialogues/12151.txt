How do you think they will handle Carrie Fisher's death in the upcoming movies?
I heard that she finished filming her part in the next film, so Leia's death won't be in that one, I think.
Or maybe they will add in her death into this film.
I feel like the audience won't want Leia to die in the films, it feels like too much.
Maybe she will go to another galaxy, or transform into something else?
I can imagine them making her transform into this spirit-type thing, and she will live forever.
Yeah, I think that would be a great homage to her, and they could bring back Han-Solo.
Whoa, yeah, that would definitely soften the blow, I think we definitely need to see him to be alright with her death.
Or maybe her part in the second film was final enough that there doesn't need to be anything enough.
I just hope whatever happens, it doesn't ruin how amazing she made the role.
