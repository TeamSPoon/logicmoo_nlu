Do you feel bad for those poor unfortunate souls from the little mermaid?
A little, but I still like Ursula.
Why do you like the villain?
Well maybe like isn't the right word for it.
Well it's a simple question, do you like her or not?
Well it's more that I feel sorry for her.
How do you feel sorry for her, she tried to steal Ariel's voice?
Well she didn't think her voice was good enough.
What does that have to do with anything?
Well I loved her song, it was incredible.
