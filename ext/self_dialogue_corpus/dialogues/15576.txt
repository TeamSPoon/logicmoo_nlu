I need to relax for a while today.
Nothing relaxes me more than listening to some music.
That is a good idea actually!
Adele music really relaxes me, what about you?
I love a lot of different types of music.
I am the same way. What is your favorite genre?
I would have to say country. I love Miranda Lambert.
Yea me to, she has some good songs.
Have you ever heard More Like Her?
Yes, that song is on one of my CD's.
Shania Twain is another one of my favirotes.
She has not come out with new music in a while.
I know, I wished she would!
Which of her songs do you like the most?
From This Moment is a beautiful song.
I agree, my sister used to love it as well.
Still The One is probably my favorite song ever.
I had forgot about that one! I love it as well.
It just has such a beautiful meaning.
It is a song that you can tell she wrote from her heart.
