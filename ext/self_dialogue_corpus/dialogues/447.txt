So pumped for the NFL coming back.
After last season I can't wait for a new champion.
Are you tired of the Patriots?
Don't get me wrong, they are a good team, but I rather someone else win.
You mean like your Rams?
Oh man, that would be the day, but that is not happening any time soon.
Yeah I know, well they will have a bright future.
Hopefully, I just hope that Goff can become an NFL level quarterback.
I am sure he will do good, he should have learned a lot while sitting.
Yeah, but I kind of wish we took Carson Wentz, he looks like he will be legit.
He's good, but who knows, Goff hasn't had a real chance to shine yet.
That is what I worry about, he hasn't beat out the current quarterback ahead of him.
Well some players need more time to be ready.
I guess so, I just don't think he is the second coming of Aaron Rodgers.
Well that is a tough model to live up to.
Yeah, well all I can do is hope for the best.
I'm rooting for you.
Say, do you want to go to a Rams game this season? I can get tickets.
I would totally be down for it.
Cool, I will let you know once I get the tickets.
