We should make a movie.
Do you really have to say that while we're naked?
Not a sextape, like a film.
A sex film?
No I mean like we should get actors and produce a short film!
What prompted this?
I was just thinking about how awesome transformers 3 was.
This is totally unwarranted right now.
We could totally make something just as great.
I have never used a camera ever.
We can learn! The university of youtube has all!
Yeah I dont think so.
I'm totally starting this. Lets hire some actors!
We dont have that kind of money man.
Ok, call some friends.
I dont think my friends would share your enthusiasm.
Well nuts to them, its going to be great! I'm hitting up craigslist!
Please put on pants first.
You can't tell me what to do, im going to be a great director!
More like great erector. Seriously, pants.
