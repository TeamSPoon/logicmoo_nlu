I've never understood if Forrest Gump is a comedy or drama.
Both.
How do you figure?
Well, it has many comedic elements, mostly Forrest himself.
But it's also got a lot of serious parts.
I get that, but let me ask you this: how often did you laugh during the movie?
Quite a bit.
Well, there's your answer.  It's part-comedy.
I guess. It still feels weird.
Trust me on this one.
