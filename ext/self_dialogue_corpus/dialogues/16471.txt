Did you hear what happened at the Ariana Grande concert?
Yes I heard! I don't know who she is, but it's so very tragic.
She's an American pop singer.
Does she sing anything I would know?
She recently sang a song with Nicki Minaj, and they performed it on Jimmy Kimmel Live.
Actually that does sound familiar. She has a great voice.
Yes she's a great singer.
She reminds me a bit of Cristina Aguilera back in the day.
Yes they're both so petite with such large voices!
I will need to check out more of her music. Does she have any new albums out this year?
I think he most recent album was last year.
That's even better - I'll be able to buy it on sale at Target.
You can also just buy them online. I buy all of my music on iTunes.
I don't have an iPhone so I've never tried to do that.
There are many other similar sites to buy music onlin though.
I will look into it. Thanks for the suggestion.
You're welcome! It's so much easier and the sites all have big databases.
That is true, so I will definitely be able to find her latest albums
You will probably even be able to purchase individual tunes rather than the entire album
Good idea, that will save me some money.
