Free Agency this season has been making many players rich.
Quarterbacks are getting paid.
Lions are going to have to lock up Stafford and give him the richest contract sooner or later.
Carr just got his money, so you know he will get his.
Stafford will get his, but does he deserve it?
He has had some awesome seasons, but the Lions are going to have to overpay for him.
He will get a record breaking deal, then that will be broken by someone else next year.
Rodgers will command a lot more money after seeing Carr get what he got, then Stafford, and you know Cousins is about to get paid.
Some of these contracts are crazy.
Amazing how much they are getting but is what it is.
As a fan I don't mind what they get paid, but it hurts my pockets when I try to go to games.
That is in an issue. Nothing like having to spend 500 dollars to take the family.
One of the reasons I stay home and watch is because it's unaffordable most of the time.
Regardless still love the game.
It does help with Fantasy football as well.
That is what seperates the NFL and most leagues.
16 games, so every game matters in NFL and in Fantasy.
Uh-huh as nothing like trying to follow a 162 game season in MLB.
I guess there is one last thing to say. Are you ready for some football!?!?!
A Monday Night party! Season is just about here and can't wait!
