What is your favorite type of movie?
It depends on my mood.
What if you are trying to be cheered up?
If that is the case then I like to watch comedies.
I love comedies too. What is your favorite one?
I love movies with Chris Farley.
He is so hilarious. What is your favorite one?
I love the movie Tommy Boy.
That is great. He was also good in Black Sheep.
I forgot about Black Sheep! I wish he was still around to make movies with David Spade.
At least we still have David.
That is true. Have you ever seen Joe Dirt.
Yes I have. That movie is dumb but so hilarious.
This is so true. Have you ever seen the sequel?
I wasn't aware that they made one.
They did. It is ok but not quite as good as the original.
That is usually how it goes.
I wouldn't mind seeing a sequel to Tommy Boy though. It is unfortunate that this will never happen.
Yes. This is making me very depressed. I might need to watch a comedy.
Do that. You should go watch Joe Dirt 2.
