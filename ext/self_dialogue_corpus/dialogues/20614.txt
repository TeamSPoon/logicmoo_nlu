Have you seen any good movies lately?
We watched Logan last week
I heard that was great.
It was. So much action.
Was it more of a super hero movie or action?
More action. He wasn't with the Xmen.
So it was just about his life?
Well it was about him after the Xmen.
Okay. So what was he?
He was actually a Limo driver.
Did people come after him?
Sort of yes. A woman needed help protecting a child.
Is that the theory it was his child?
Well actually it was.
With who. Dr Grey?
No. She was gentically produced with his DNA.
Did she have claws too?
Yes, actually she did.
That's pretty neat.
Yes, it was. She was a great fighter just like him.
