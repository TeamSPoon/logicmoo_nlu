Who will have the best defense in the NFL next season?
Well, you have to start with the best defense in the league last year.
Which team is that?
The Houston Texans were the best last year.
Really?    They were better than the Arizona Cardinals?
The Cardinals were close, but ranked second.
I thought J.J. Watt being out would've hurt the Texans more.
I agree, but the rise of Jedaveon Clowney helped out quite a lot.
Right, but the pass rush still wasn't as strong, right?
Well, Clowney and Whitney Mercilus did a good job together.
OK, I can see that    Is Watt healthy?
He has been working in the preseason workouts.
Well, add the best defensive player in the league to the best defense.
Yes, if everyone is healthy, it will be almost impossible to score on the Texans.
Didn't they change up some things on the coaching staff?
Yes.     Romeo Crennel was promoted.
Will that hurt the defense.
Not really, Crennel is still present, and the new coordinator has been with the franchise.
What's the name of the new Defensive Coordinator?
He is Mike Vrabel.
