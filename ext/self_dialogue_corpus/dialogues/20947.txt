I loved Moana.
I did too. I wish I could in real life see water that was that color.
Oh me too. It was so amazing and so clear.
That beginning scene got me when the water lifts up and you see all the fish and other marine life swimming as it surrounds moana.
It was so beautiful.
And I really felt the love between Moana and her grandmother. It reminded me of my connection with my grandmother.
Yes, I cried when she died.
It had some great music as well.
Yes it did and I need to get the music.  And the actress who played Moana had a fantastic voice.
Yes, I like her rendition of the song better than Ariana Grande's.
Yeah, I don't know why Disney didn't did that.
Anyway Maui was fantastic.
Oh yes and now I always say "your welcome" like he does.
Oh do you sing it to?
Yes I do. Ha ha! I love that song!
I am amazed at how they can make the animation so real.
It does look like a place that exists in real life.
Yep it does. I want to go visit that place.
The ending was so awesome but kind of sad.
I did feel sad for the island they were all leaving. I know they needed to explore, but I felt sorry for it.
