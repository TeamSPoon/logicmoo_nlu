What was the last Disney movie you saw?
I just saw Disney's Beauty and the Beast!
How did you like it?
It was really good actually! I wasn't expecting much from it.
Why do you say that?
Because I was a fan of the original animated version. So I didn't think it would transfer over that well.
Yea? How did everything feel in the movie?
Honestly all the singing, and for the most part everything else was pretty spot on with the original. So it was really good.
Is there anything you didn't like about the new movie?
Not really, I felt they did a fantastic job. All tho the beast did look a little out of place. He just didn't seem real enough.
