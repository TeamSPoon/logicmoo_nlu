What is your favorite comedy movie?
That is a tough choice.
I know there are so many good movies to choose from.
I think my favorite would have to be Step Brothers.
I like that movie as well.
It has so many great one liners.
It sure does.
Will Ferrel does a great job in that movie.
I agree, I like when they are building bunk beds.
That is a great part of the movie.
Who would have thought a movie about two grown step brothers could be so funny.
I know.
I had my doubts about it when I saw the preview.
I did too, I am glad they did a good job on the film.
Me too.  I was not dissapointed.
I wish they would make another one.
I hope they do, it would be best if they kept all the same characters.
That would make it great.
It would be hard to come up with so many good jokes to make another movie.
It sure would.
