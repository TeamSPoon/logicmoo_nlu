Oh my god, have you watched Moana with your kids?
No, why?
It is so cute and sweet!
Hmm, I'll have to check it out what's it about again?
It's a movie about ancient Hawaiians.
Is it live action or animated?
It's an animated musical.
Oh is that the one with the Rock?
Yes.
Okay, I will definitely check it out.
I think your little girl will really like it.
Yeah, she's really into the Princess and the Frog right now, I need to get her to watch something else.
Oh that was a cute one too.
Yeah, kind of.
What do you mean?
I just wasn't a fan, there were a lot of stereotypes in that film!
I thought it was really good.
Yes, but that firefly is horrible. It's just really annoying the 50th time you watch it!
Oh, yes. Haha I know how that feels.
I'll have to pick up a copy of Moana and see if that will distract her.
