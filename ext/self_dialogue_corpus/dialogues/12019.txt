So what did you think about Rogue One?
I thought it was well made. It also ties in nicely to the series.
Yeah it explained what happened in between the third and fourth movie.
Yeah I always wondered how they knew the weak point of the death star.
Did you like the Force Awakens?
No not really. I thought it was too cheesy and nostalgic.
Yeah they tried to incorporate too many of the old characters and had too many allusions.
Yeah the flashbacks of Han, Chewy, and Leigh were questionable.
I like the fact that they're releasing a movie every year and I can't wait to see the new one in December.
Yeah I'm really interested to see who the new Jedi's are.
