Do you like the NFL?
Yes.
Who is your favorite team?
I like the Atlanta Falcons.
Why do you like them?
My old teacher used to play for them?
Why did he decide to start teaching?
He got injured.
It is a dangerous sport.
Yeah, it might not last forever.
There are plenty of people who get injured.
Yeah, it's all the tackling.
I would be scared to get tackled by some of them.
Yeah, the pads only do so much.
I like to watch it on TV.
Yeah, with all the camera angles, you get a lot of detail.
Have you ever been to a game?
No.
Would you like to see one?
That might be fun.
