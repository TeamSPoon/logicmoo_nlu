Who is your favorite comedian?
I would have to say Jim Carrey.
Haha, I love him. Especially in the move The Mask.
That movie is awesome. Its kind of cartoon-ish but still hilarious.
Do you remember the part where he makes a tommy gun out of a baloon?
Yes, that part was hilarious.
That's my favorite part of the entire movie.
My favorite part is when the dog puts on the mask and goes crazy.
Yeah that part is too funny. The dog comes to the rescue and saves the day.
Then at the end Jim Carey swallows the dynamite to stop the building from blowing up. So clever.
