Did you hear that they're coming out with a Daddy's Home 2?
Yeah I did actually. I can't believe it.
Me either. The first one wasn't that good.
It was okay, but sequel worthy? Not sure about that.
Both Ferrell and Wahlberg were better in The Other Guys.
Absolutely. That movie was a gem.
That office pop scene was hilarious.
I know. There's so many good scenes in that film.
We should watch it again soon.
I'm down when you are.
