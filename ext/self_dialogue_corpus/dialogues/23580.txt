Have you watched any good movies lately?
Well not any new ones lately, but I did watch Goodfellas the other night.
I love that movie. Nothing like a good mafia movie.
There were so many great actors in it.
Yea and they seem to be stereotyped in a lot of mob movies.
Yes, like De Niro and Pesci.
Joe Pesci plays a great mafia guy. He's quirky but he fits the part.
Yes De Niro too. He is flexible as an actor.
Yea, he does comedies, dramas, action and thrillers.
When they killed Billy Batts is when it all broke loose for them.
Yea, Pesci's characters seem to lose their cool in a lot of his movies.
Yea, and Ray Liotta too.
He really is convinving in his roles.
Yeah and he started on a soap opera.
Really, which one?
Another World baci in the eightees I think.
I didn't know that.
Yea, not a lot of actors were on daytime T.V..
No I guess they weren't. Rick springfield was in General Hospital.
Yea, but not sure if he was in movies or just a singer.
