Can you believe there is only 2 months left before the NFL Season?
I know I am super excited, are you going to opening day?
No I cant its on a Thursday September 7th I have school next day. Are you?
Yes my family goes to Gillette stadium every year for opening night, its a tradition.
I think the Patriots are loading up this year as rumor is Brady is retiring.
Oh no way I don't believe it, I know the papers mentioned it but he said he wants to play 5 more years.
Yeah but did you hear his wife Giselle mention that last year he played with concussions?
Yeah that was crazy. What do you think about the Jets horror show this year?
Oh man I cant believe what they are doing, that should be illegal!
I know right ! How can you cut every single high priced player just to lose every game to get the #1 pick.
Its crazy, I know some sports the teams try to tank during the season to get a better draft pick, but not BEFORE the season starts!
Hey are the Patriots even playing Jets in New York this year or only in Foxoboro?
Yeah they play them in New York on Sunday October 15th.
Oh no way! Is that a flex game or is the time set?
It looks like its set for 1pm. Do you want to drive down here to see them?
Oh man YES, you can get me 2 tickets over there? I would love to bring my girl.
Yeah I can get tickets to Met Life stadium here of coarse, nobody is buying them this year since team is tanking.
Thats true but I think the Patriots game will be fun.
OH YES! The entire stadium will be filled with Patriots blue, pretty funny to see that in New Jersey.
Awesome man I will see you there!
