I like older Disney films.
Yes. You never knew what was gonna happen
Now they all follow a certain pattern
Yeah. it seems to be a bit lazy
Dumbo had a great story and you did not know what would happen next
I agree, I had no idea how it would turn out
I like the Disney films where they follow a character on a journey
I agree. The Little Mermaid is a good example of that.
Yes it is.
She has a goal and then a bunch of thing happen to her and we do not know what will happen.
