If you could bring back one comedian who died, who would you pick?
I would go with Chris Farley.
That would be epic.
I grew up watching him doing somersaults through walls and table, I miss him.
He is a hard man to replace in a film.
I think Kevin James is as close to a stand in that we can get.
Yeah he is pretty spry for a hefty fellow, but Chris had better slapstick.
Well no one falls through a table like him, it was like he didn't even register it after it happened; beautiful.
I've seen Tommy boy like 50 times, and the first scene is still my favorite for him.
Oh yeah, when he just passed out and dropped to the floor through a table.
That's the one, I know it wasn't as energetic as most of his falls but that one just makes me laugh more.
I know what you mean, but there is no better scene than "Fat guy in a little coat."
Touche, that is most definitely one of his greatest one liners.
Well it's been 20 years and it's still going strong.
I just wish he could be back on SNL.
The things that came out of his mouth when it was unscripted, were just pure genius.
Did you see Beverley hills' Ninja?
Yeah like 20 times, how could you not?
I laugh every time at the final fight scene when he's trying to defuse the bomb, but he takes about the phone instead.
I always lose it when he hooks Gobei to the bus then sends him flying over the cliff.
