Do you like the Fast & Furious movies?
Yes, quite a bit.
I like them as well.
Who is your favorite character.
I like the character Paul Walker played.
That is my favorite as well.
It is too bad he passed away in that accident.
It sure is.
We lost a good one there.  I don't think the movies will be the same going forward.
No, they definitely won't.
