I just got back from seeing Wonder Woman.
How did you like it?
I thought it was actually great!
That's outstanding! Who is in it?
Gal Gadot and Chris Pine. They are both great in it too.
Oh yeah I imagine they are. Chris Pine is one of my favorite actors.
Yeah mine too. I loved him in Star Trek.
I loved him in that movie. He played Captian Kirk better than anyone.
I wouldn't go that far, but he played him extremely well.
What did you like the most about Wonder Woman?
I would have to say the action scenes.
I could easily see that. The previews made it look great.
There was one scene in it that looked 100% real! I couldn't even tell it was CGI!
I love when movies do that!
Me too. Almost everything is CGI now, but it is great when you can't tell the difference.
I heard that most CGI that is hard to tell the difference is smoke, cars, and dirt exploding.
I heard that too, but I don't know why.
I guess it is because it is predictable. Smoke has a distinct path it will travel.
Wow that makes so much sense. You should go in to movies!
I wish. I just read the article about how CGI goes in movies.
