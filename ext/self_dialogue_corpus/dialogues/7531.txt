I was watching HP series. Do you really think Snape is good guy or bad guy?
Everyone thinks he's a good guy. What do you mean?
You know, he's always riding Harry and he's kind of a butt head to everyone.
But he always seems to be helping Harry inadvertently.
Only because Dumbledore told him to and he felt guilty about Lilly.
Yeah, maybe but he was in love with her too.
Sure, maybe Snape could see her in Harry. They always talk about his green eyes and how he looks like his mother.
Yeah, see it could be that.
It would make a great twist if he's really bad to the core.
Well, guess you will have to finish the series to find out. I'm not spilling the beans.
