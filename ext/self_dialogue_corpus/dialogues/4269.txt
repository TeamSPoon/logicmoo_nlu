Have you heard of the Annabelle horror franchise?
I have. They're the movies about the doll, right?
Yes! A new one just came out recently called Annabelle: Creation.
Is Lulu Wilson in the movie?
She is. She plays Linda in the film.
How is this movie related to the other Annabelle movies?
It is a prequel. It tells the story behind the doll.
Is it scarier than the last film?
That's what all of the early reviews say.
I believe it! The story behind the doll might be scarier than the doll
