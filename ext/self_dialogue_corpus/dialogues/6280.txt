What's your favorite classic Disney movie?
You mean like old school, like Alice in Wonderland?
Yeah, I actually tried to watch the original of that movie, it was really odd.
Did you see the remake of it with Johnny Depp?
Yeah, I did, I thought that version was odd too.
Me too.  I guess one of my favorites was Mary Poppins.
Oh I did really like that movie.
I liked the movie as a kid and still like watching it today.
For sure, and the songs can really get stuck in your head.
Yeah, I find myself humming "just a spoonful of sugar" quite a bit.
