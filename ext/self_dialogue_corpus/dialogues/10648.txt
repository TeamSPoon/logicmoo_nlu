Did you like Fast and the Furious Tokyo Drift?
Yes at first it was off putting since it was new characters but I got used to it.
Yeah that was a little off putting for me too.
I did like the drifting and different race styles that was in that movie.
Speaking of that do you remember the first race of the movie?
The one where Sean Boswell I think his name is was racing?
Yes, I actually liked his character.
Yeah he was a good installment to the franchise.
I just remember him trying to learn to drift and crashing into all kinds of things in that first one.
Yeah that was a good part in the movie showing how even people have to learn in movies.
