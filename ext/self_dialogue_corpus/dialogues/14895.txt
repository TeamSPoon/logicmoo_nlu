Have you seen the movie Bridesmaids?
No, I haven't. Who is in that film?
Kristen Wiig and Melissa McCarthy are both in it.
Oh yeah! I know Kristen Wiig from Saturday Night Live.
And Melissa McCarthy is in Ghostbusters, which just came out this year.
I haven't seen that yet, but I definitely want to! We should go!
Absolutely. Another one that just came out is Rough Night.
Isn't that with Scarlett Johansson?
Yeah! And Ilana Glazer, and Kate McKinnon.
They're all funny! Kate McKinnon was great in Office Christmas Party.
