I think my favorite song is the one Olaf sings.
Ya I'm sure nobody would forget Olaf.
I know I won't.
I think Olaf may be my favorite Disney character.
Hmm.. that's a tough one I'm not sure who mine is.
I think my favorite Disney movie may be UP though.
I still haven't seen Up.
You really should I thought it was great.
Ya I've heard that. I need to remember to watch it.
I actually have the movie do you want to watch it now?
