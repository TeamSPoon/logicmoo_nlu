The Rams are going to be awful this year.
You think so?  They'll do better than you think.
Nope, they're terrible.  No offense.
Goff had a rough year, but is getting better.
Dude, Goff never got better last year.
Well, he got picked off less as the year progressed.
Yeah, okay, that's some really sound reasoning.
It's a fact though, he's getting better.
Sure, whatever you say.
You can't argue that the defense isn't good though.
I wouldn't say good, but they do have some quality players.
Aaron Donald is the best DT in the league.
No doubt he's good, but not #1.
Name one DT better than him.
Some guy named JT Watt comes to mind.
He was hurt all last year.
So?  Watt's the best player in the league when healthy.
Right, but if he's not healthy, he's just a guy.
Look, not arguing Donald isn't really darn good, just saying that Watt is infinitely better.
Your opinion stinks, but we'll see.
