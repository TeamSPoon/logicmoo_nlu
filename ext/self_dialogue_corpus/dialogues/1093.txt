So do you think the Patriots will repeat this year?
I don't think so.
They were lucky!
I don't know about that.
They had too many injured players out when they won.
But to come back from that many points, that's amazing.
Right, I don't think we'll see anything close to that again in a Superbowl.
That's for sure.
I'd hate to be on the Falcon's team.
Why do you say that?
Because, to let them come back from that many points down - someone should be fired.
So you saying their going to release some players and rebuild the defense?
Maybe..either that our get rid of some of their coaches.
Coaches, they weren't even on the field
But their suppose to get the players read and they weren't
Obviously!
So who do you think will win this year?
Not sure, Raiders maybe.
Raiders, what!!
They have beast mode!
