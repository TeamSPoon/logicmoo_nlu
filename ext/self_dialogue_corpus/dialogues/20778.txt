If you will it, dude, it is no dream.
Oh, I've heard that. What's that from?
The Big Lebowski. John Goodman's character.
Oh yeah, Walter, he's saying that to the dude.
Yep! Mr. Tron himself, Jeffrey Bridges.
Dude that movie is a classic!
Yep, I just watched it again last night!
Dude, don't you feel bad for Donny? Walter is pretty mean to him.
Yeah, but Steven Buscemi has done some tough guy roles too, like Boardwalk Empire.
This is true. You know, my goal is to be the dude.
"The Dude abides."
Exactly! Yeah, that's the life, right?
There are SO many quotable lines in that movie.
I know! Like, "well, that's just, like, your opinion, man."
I use that all the time.
Yeah me too. That's probably why I don't get more dates.
Do you know there are festivals surrounding The Big Lebowski movie?
Yeah I know. I can't decide whether I would actually want to go to one.
I think it would be awesome!
It would definitely be something!
