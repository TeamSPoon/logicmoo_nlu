I watched a really wacky movie last night you should check out.
What is its name?
It's called "Zombeavers."
What type of movie is that?
It's a B Horror film.
Is it good?
It's not a "good" movie but it is very entertaining.
What's so entertaining about it?
As a Hoosier, I appreciated that they make a lot of jokes about one girl not knowing facts about beavers because all people from Indiana are supposed to know beaver trivia.
That's pretty goofy.
There's also an amazing song that plays over the credits.
What song is it?
It's an original song that rehashes the premise and plot of the movie, in a Sinatra jazz style.
That seems like an odd way to spend what I'm guessing was a low budget. Would I know anyone in the film?
John Mayer is in it, believe it or not.
The singer? I didn't know that he acted.
It was his first role, and it's pretty small.
Did he sing the credits song?
I don't believe so.
Oh well. I might check it out.
