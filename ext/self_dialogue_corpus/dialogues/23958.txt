I am never going to see all the movies on the list of my movies to watch.
That's why I recommend keeping it really short.
See that wouldn'r work for me.
Why not?
because I need a lot of options to choose from when I'm picking out a movie. If I pick out the right one but at the wrong time I may end up enjoying it significantly less than I otherwise would have.
That's likeâ€¦ ridiculously finicky.
I know, it really is. And that's if I don't otherwise get distracted and give up on the movie because it's just not the right time to watch it.
But it doesn't sound like the long list working for you either.
Well it kind of does, but that's taking me too long  to pick movies out from. I probably had more than 2000 movies on my list of movies to watch, and sometimes I spend the length of a movie just reviewing the list.
Alright. You're completely insane. No, you're never gonna watch all those movies.
But why not?
Because you just said you're never going to watch all those movies. Man, you really are insane!
I have already seen around 2500 movies from beginning to end, but I guess it still would be hard to finish that list. Especially since I keep adding more.
So maybe if you stop adding movies to that list, you'll be able to watch the ones that are already on it when you're twice as old as you are now.
That sounds like an idea. But I don't think I can stop adding movies to the list, there's too many interesting ones I keep discovering.
Don't you get tired of watching movies?
Yeah, sometimes, and then I find other things to do. Which I guess is why I am so behind on the list.
I'm gonna find that list of yours and erase it.
Oh don't do that. I know it sounds crazy, but the advantage is that when I finally do settle on just the right thing to watch after consulting the list of films I was curious about, I usually end up enjoying it!
Yeah, but then you have to find a copy of it to watch. I just look at what's easily available.
