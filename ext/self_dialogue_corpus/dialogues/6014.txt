What do you think ever happened to Sid?
You mean the bad kid from 'Toy Story?'
Yea.  After the toys revealed themselves to him.
I'm assuming that he either became a better person, or he ended up losing his mind.
I think both those options are likely.  I mean as a kid, how would you react to seeing toys start talking?
Especially in a scary fashion like that.
I don't get how the Woody and the other toys got away with that.
I agree.  I would assume there's some cosmic law or consequence for revealing themselves to humans.
And if not, how would the toys know, or feel inclined to pretend to be inanimate every time Andy enters a room.
I know it's a children's movie so the questions will never be answered.  But it's fun to think about.
