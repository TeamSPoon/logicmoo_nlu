Have you ever watched to movie Passengers?
Yea I have, with Chris Pratt, right?
Yea, and Jennifer Lawrence. Did you like it?
I thought it was decent.
Really? I thought it was amazing?
What did you like so much about it?
I just really liked the premise. I keep wondering what I would do in that situation.
Yea it's a tough spot to be in.
See, that's why I like it. I like impossible scenarios. Chris Pratt's character does what he finds to be the only option, but that option ruins Jennifer Lawrence's life.
I thought it was a bit unbelievable that she ended up forgiving him.
I didn't. It's the same reason Chris Pratt made the decision in the first place. He had no choice.
Yea but people can harbor resentment for a long time.
Well, he did do a lot to redeem himself, and I just feel like over time, when the reality as set in, people would be able to understand and adapt.
Yea I guess so, I mean what other choice did she have right?
Exactly. Die alone in a ship where there was another person right next to you the whole time?
Yea, I don't know. The situation still felt uncomfortable.
Yea but that was the whole point. It's a thinking movie.
Yea you're right, I guess it was pretty cool.
The acting was amazing too.
Yea, they both really impressed me.
