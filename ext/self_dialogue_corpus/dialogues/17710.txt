What have you been listening to on the radio lately?
Basically, whatever comes on.
Yeah, I meant what station, I guess.
Oh, well I like 105.1.
Oh, the Pop station?
Yeah, well really its just top hits.
Well what hits are they playing? I don't listen to the radio really.
Well, Ed Sheeran is very popular nowadays.
Oh, yeah I love his music.
Me too! He has a new album.
Yeah, I've heard a couple songs like "Shape of You"
That's the one that plays the most.
Makes sense why, he's amazing.
Did you hear +, his first album?
Yes, that's when I first discovered him.
The A Team is a classic song, to me.
Yeah, I also like Give me Love.
Me too, it kind of makes me sad though!
Why, which part makes you sad?
When he's repeating "Love me!" over and over, so dramatic!
