What's your favorite Academy Award winning film?
Amadeus.
That's a great film! I love Tom Hulce as Mozart.
F. Murray Abrams was masterful as Salieri too.
I liked how it mixed the lightheartedness of Mozart with all the dark stuff about his father.
Yeah, it's definitely a well done film. What's your favorite Academy Award winner?
I really love The English Patient.
Ah, yes. That's a beautiful movie.
Yes, everything about it is stunning -- the cinematography, music, acting.
Didn't Juliette Binoche win an Academy Award for that?
Yes, she played a French Canadian nurse. I was surprised the other actors were not recognized though.
Yeah, Ralph Fiennes was excellent. It's funny to see him in Harry Potter movies.
I haven't seen any of those, is he any good?
Yeah, he is. But my favorite is Alan Rickman.
I really like Alan Rickman! I watched Sense and Sensibility growing up and he was quite moving as Colonel Brandon.
Yes, I love that film. Emma Thompson is amazing.
Yes, she is. They were a couple in Love Actually.
Yes, I remember that. He was cheating on her.
Yes, how sad. That was kind of a silly plot of a movie, though.
True, but it was entertaining to see Hugh Grant as the Prime Minister making out with one of his staff.
