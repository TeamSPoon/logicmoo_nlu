are u excited for the cleveland game tonight?
ehh, yes and no
Lebron seems to be unstoppable though right?
well, that's just it, is he really unstoppable athletically or just a cash cow?
does it matter if you watch the whole series anyway?
i suppose for some, though i do not, nor do i know of anyone watching every game of the series
how much fun would it be to not have all the hype and irrelevant branding and money references though?
actually, all sports not just basketball suffer from having no focus on actual sport and competition
exactly, which is why it's cool to tune in and what & who is cool in the nba whilst keeping up with playoffs as well; right?
how much have you made for being a loyal cleveland playoff 'theoretical' supporter?
huh, what do you mean how much have i made, like personally?
yes, your actual personal monetary benefit from so called 'support' of the cavaliers?
i don't understand what you mean, how do i make money watching someone else do something?
exactly, go and do for yourself;  even if that means going to play basketball yourself to at least reap the physical benefits
but then what kind of cleveland fan am i, and how would i know of Lebron's highlights?
case and point ignorant one, professional teams do not exist without your wasted money and time on them;  yet sports are still always here for us to enjoy and actually benefit from
so i don't get it, why is there even an nba.    .or any other league for that matter?
exactly, and furthermore why would you use time you could be experiencing a sport and begin fit, on watching anyone else?
well then what is there to talk about if not all the playoffs going on?
perhaps EVERYTHiNG else in the world that has relevance, not a price
