Have you kept up with the NFL during the off season?
Not much. What about you?
No. I don't even know how the draft went.
Me either but I hope the Falcons have a good season.
Me too. That Matt Ryan is really something.
If he has another season like last season they'll be good again.
I hope he does but they need some defense.
You got that right. But it was better than season before last.
You know what they say, offense brings in the fans...
But defense wins championships.
That was sure true this year.
Uh huh. I still can't believe how the defense blew that lead in the Super Bowl.
One of the worst collapses in the history of sports.
It's hard to bet against Tom Brady.
How much longer can that guy go on?
He's got to call it quits someday. But maybe it will be a Falcons-Patriots rematch.
I wouldn't mind seeing that at all. Especially if the Falcons could win.
They deserve one, you know, after all this time.
Never had one yet.
Well maybe the 2018 Super Bowl will be theirs. Finally!
