Do you like the Raiders?
Yes
Did you see them in the Super Bowl?
Yes
Did you like it?
I loved it
But, they lost
I don't care
You are an interesting fan
It was very memorable
They got blown out by the Buccaneers
It was a really good game
I didn't expect it to be so one sided
I did
Really?
Tampa Bay had too good of an offense
I thought they were known for defense?
They were
You have a different point of view
I do. I love the Raiders.
