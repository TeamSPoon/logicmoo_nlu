Who do you think is the nicest player in the NFL?
I've heard that Russell Wilson is pretty good with fans, especially young ones
I've seen him on the news visiting children's hospitals in Seattle
A lot of players do that, like Andy Dalton in Cincinnati with his wife, if I remember right
Speaking of players and their wives, I see a lot about Eli Manning and his wife making pretty sizeable donations
Donating money is great, of course, but seeing players out there volunteering is pretty awesome
One of my favorite NFL videos that isn't game-related is seeing J. J. Watt passing the ball back and forth with young fans before a game
J. J. Watt seems like a pretty cool guy, considering he's huge and those pictures of him covered in blood are kind of terrifying
He's just a big teddy bear who loves the game and loves life
When players are enjoying themselves, it makes them a lot more fun to watch
Definitely, like Odell Beckham Jr. when he's in a good mood
Kirk Cousins has that video where he's yelling, "You like that!" and now it's like his catchphrase
Cousins is pretty popular as a nice guy and all around good player
Do you think they'll trade him to the 49ers like the rumors have been saying?
I don't know, but I hope that they do so he brings some of that positivity to San Francisco
It does seem like the team has been down in the dumps for a while, what with the lousy records and all their players leaving or retiring
They have a pretty nice guy too in Joe Staley; he's a character
You don't really see offensive linemen being super popular like that, so it's a nice change of pace
Or fullbacks like John Kuhn, who I think should have been kept in Green Bay
That's the NFL for you, though, and the Saints are another team that could do with some uplifting
