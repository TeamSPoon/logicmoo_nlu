I just saw the scariest movie I've ever seen!
What movie?
The Ring. It was so terrifying.
I'd heard of that movie, but never watched it.
I'm not sure if I should recommend it or not. It was really good, but I'm still freaked out.
What's it about?
So, the idea is that there's this videotape. And anyone who watches it dies in 7 days.
They die in 7 days? How?
I don't want to ruin the movie, in case you see it.
Give me at least a little bit of an idea.
Well, OK - What happens is that after they watch the movie, they get a phone call. And a little girl's voice says 'Seven days' and hangs up.
And....?
I don't want to spoil it any further!
I will say, evil children is one of the creepiest things in horror movies.
Yep, and this is a particularly good use of that concept.
Are there any famous actors in it, or is a bunch of no-names?
Naomi Watts plays the lead. I didn't recognize anyone else.
I might watch it sometime, but only with friends, in broad daylight.
I know, I could barely sleep last night after having watched it. I was so frightened.
Horror movies are weird. It's like, you barely enjoy them at all, in a certain sense.
