Hey, do you ever watch those old superhero movies?
Do you mean like the old Batman movies and stuff like that?
I'm talking about the really old stuff. For example, did you ever see black and white Batman movies?
I didn't realize they made black and white Batman movies, actually.
They actually made a series of shorts back in 1943.
I guess they used to do more shorts back in the old days.
They did. Movies used to sometimes have those news highlight reels about the war.
I guess nowadays they pretty much just show trailers.
I feel like that's part of the fun of going to the movies, though.
That's true.
Plus, you get to find out about all of the new stuff coming out.
I hate when a trailer looks really good, and then the movie turns out to be really bad.
Yes. Sometimes all of the good stuff is in the trailers, and then there's nothing left for the movie.
Usually if the trailers make it seem like the movie is all special effects, I don't bother seeing the movie.
So, you're not a car-chase fan?
No. I prefer the subtle stuff.
Alfred Hitchcock was good at that.
Yes. He was the master of suspense.
Psycho is basically an all-time classic.
I guess they don't usually make them like that anymore.
