Who are your favorite wide receivers in the NFL?
Of all time or right now?
Of all time.
Jerry Rice is the best ever.
I 100% agree with you. Jerry Rice is number one.
I feel like they based that movie Rudy after him.
Why do you say that?
Because Jerry Rice was ignored by NFL scouts for being too small.
I never heard about that, that's interesting.
Yea. But, anyway, next is Don Hutson.
Who is that?
He played waaay back in the day. Like in the 1940s.
Oh come on, there's no way he could hang with toay's players.
I wouldn't be too sure about that.
Ok, fair enough, who else? Nobody from 100 years ago.
Haha ok then, Randy Moss.
Now that's more like it, that guy moved at the speed of light.
Yea, I really miss seeing him on the field.
Hey we all get old.
Ain't that the truth.
