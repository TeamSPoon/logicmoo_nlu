Have you ever seen The Little Mermaid?
No, I haven't seen it. What is it about?
It's about a mermaid named Ariel who gives up her voice in order to be able to go on land.
Why does she want to go on land?
She falls in love with a handsome prince, but since she's a mermaid she can't get to know him.
Does she end up marrying him?
Yes, but first she has to make him fall in love with her even though she can't talk.
That sounds challenging. I don't understand how you can fall in love with someone if you can't talk to them.
The evil sea witch Ursula tries to stop them from falling in love by using Ariel's voice to woo the prince.
Wow, that sounds kind of interesting.
