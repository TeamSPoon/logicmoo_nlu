Did you get to see Snatched yet?
No I haven't , it looks great.
I will be going to see it this weekend. I love Goldie Hawn and Amy Schumer, I am sure they are going to be fantastic.
I know , I can't even believe Goldie is acting again, it has been some time since her last film.
She does great comedy films. Wanda Sykes is also in this film too.
What time does the movie play?
It starts around 1pm, do you think you will have this weekend off?
I think I have to work that day, I will have to check on it.
Maybe you can come with me!
I will call you and let you know!
