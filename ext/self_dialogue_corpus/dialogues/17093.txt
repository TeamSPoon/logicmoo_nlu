Did you know Yes is touring this year?
Really? I would like to see them.
They will be at the Oklahoma City Zoo in August
Wow, They are an awesome band.
Yep, and Jon Anderson will be singing, which is just icing on the cake.
I agree I love his voice.
The only downside is, it is a outside even and it will be really hot in August in Oklahoma.
Very true, it could be miserable.
I'm trying to decide if it is worth it.
I got to see their Anderson Bruford Wakeman and Howe tour in 1988, it was awesome
Oh, I bet that was great.
Yeah, one of the best concerts I have been to.
I saw Ozzy in concert once; it was crazy.
Oh, I bet!
I was right up in the front and he threw beer in the crowd and I got it all over me.
That is nuts.
I was so afraid I would get pulled over and have to walk a white line. I hadn't had anything to drink, but I sure smelled like it.
Yeah, but well worth it to see Ozzy in concert.
He is one of the greats.
I totally agree.
