How are you feeling about the upcoming NFL season?
Great! I'm so excited to see the Cowboys dominate again.
Are you sure they're going to be as great as they were last year?
Of course, why wouldn't they be?
Well, the Cowboys actually have a lot going against them this year in comparison to the amazing season they had last year.
Like what? I'm not sure what you're talking about.
Well, for starters, I think Dek Prescott isn't going to have nearly as good of a season as last year.
It's not like he's injured or anything. He's going to be great just like he has been.
A lot of quarterbacks regress a good deal in their second NFL season as defenses adjust to them. Remember Colin Kaepernick?
That's a fair point. But it's only speculation, and one reason at that!
Well, the Cowboys also lost a great deal of players on defense. I think 4 of the starters in the secondary left during free agency?
Oh wow. I know we had people leave in the off-season but I didn't realize it was that many.
Yeah the Cowboys corners and safetys aren't looking that great. Which is scary considering everyone in the NFC East really upgraded their receiving corps this offseason.
Cornerback is one of those positions where a star can emerge at any time. I'm sure we'll see some talent develop throughout the course of the season.
Still though, I wouldn't expect the same kind of regular season record as last year. They've also lost two of their starters from the offensive line.
That's not good. That line was one of the best in the league. Top five last year I'd say!
I agree. However, when you have young playmakers like Ekeziel Elliott sometimes you can afford to have gaps in talent at other positions.
He is so fun to watch. The Cowboys are never out of a game when he's playing!
I agree! It's going to be a great season to watch the Cowboys.
And to watch them in the Super Bowl hopefully!
