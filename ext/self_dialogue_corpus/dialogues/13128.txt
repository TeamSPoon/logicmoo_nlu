What did you think of Rogue One?
I loved it! It was so sad!
I know. It was very different having Jyn and all of the other protagonists die at the end.
That made it more powerful though, because it was a realistic suicide mission.
It wasn't like some of the other movies, where the heroes should have died a million times over.
Return of the Jedi was so bad about that! At the very least, Han and Leia should have died on Endor while trying to deactivate the shield.
Yeah, even though Leia got shot, it never felt like she was in any danger.
I think that's what made it so shocking when Kylo Ren killed Han in the Force Awakens.
I definitely did not see that coming! It will be hard for Kylo Ren to redeem himself now.
Does he need to redeem himself though? In the trailer to The Last Jedi, Luke suggests that there's more to the Force than just Light and Dark.
