Who is going to win it all this year?
I would say the Patriots are still contenders.
Really? I think the Falcons have an even better chance this year.
But can they hold a big super bowl lead?
That remains to be seen.
I thikn the VIkings could be around in a major way this year.
Yea, Bradford knows the team and Cook/Murray can run
And they can play defense, unlike the rest of the north
If they dont fall apart midway through the year
5-0 to 5-5 doesnt come easily
Yea, that was a bad turn of events
Nothing they could do about it
How about the seahawks?
They werent as good last year, they will get worse this year
How about the SAints
Adrian wont have that much of an impact, he's old
Well, we wont be bored
when is the fantasy draft?
next month, post preseason
looking forward to it
