What was the name of that movie from the 90's where the nanny terrorizes the house?
The Hand That Rocks The Cradle?
Yes, that's the one! It was on television last night.
That was a pretty solid movie. I usually watch it if it happens to be on television as well.
Rebecca DeMornay was so evil in the film!
She really was. She did a good job of controlling her rage and facial expressions, but you still could feel her seething underneath it all.
The ending, when Annabella Sciorra and Rebecca DeMornay are fighting in the attic was incredible!
It seemed to go on forever! I remember the first time I watched the movie, the anxiety was killing me.
Me too, that was intense!
I almost think it went on just a tad too long!
