I just started listening to Christmas carols again today.
That makes me so excited. That means it's almost time for my favorite holiday season.
Yes it does!
What's your favorite Christmas carol?
That's a tough question. I don't know if I could pick one.
Just try your best. It doesn't have to be your absolute favorite, maybe just one you really like.
I really like "The First Noel."
What a great choice!
What's your favorite Christmas carol?
I love "Sleigh Bells"?
That's an interesting answer. I don't know anyone else whose favorite Christmas carol is that one.
Really? I used to play it all the time when I used to play my piano for the people in the nursing home.
That's just such a nice story. How long have you played the piano?
Since I was twelve. My mom randomly decided to buy a piano one day and I've been playing ever since.
I wish I knew how to play an instrument.
It's never too late.
That's true. What instrument do you think is easiest to learn?
I'm not really sure. They all have some mighty challenges.
I think I'd most want to learn how to play the guitar.
Then you should learn how to play it! It's a skill you'll have forever.
