I saw a clip of Kristen Bell on Ellen singing that Frozen song!
Which one did she sing?
The Snowman song, she's highly talented with her voice acting.
I'll have to take a look, that whole movie is so darn catchy!
I know it's been a few years now, and my kids still want to watch it every week!
That's hilarious. You must have all of the songs memorized at this point.
It's a great movie for the kids and encourages love with their siblings.
I did love the new direction they went with the Prince being the ultimate villain.
It was an awesome example to set for little girls everywhere.
I agree I loved the message of the whole movie!
