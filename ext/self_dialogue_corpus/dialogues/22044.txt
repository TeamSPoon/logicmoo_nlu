What's your favorite movie?
Of all time? That's a hard question
It is, I think mine would be the x-men movies
Those are pretty great. I think im Going to go with pirates of the Caribbean.
Those are good too
It's so hard to pick one movie, we both picked a series
Series movies like that have a great storyline
That's very true, I agree.
I also like romance movies
Me too, I just watched nights in Rodanthe
Was it good? I've been meaning to watch it
I enjoyed it a lot, a little sad though
That's understandable with a Nicolas sparks book based movie
All his stuff seems to have sad endings.
That's true, I wonder why
I hate to watch his stuff because of that,but they are always great stories
They are, he builds great characters and great romance
I liked that one with Mikey cyrus
Me too, I can't remember the name of it
Neither can i
