Have you seen the second Guardians of the Galaxy?
Yes, I have.  I liked it!
I liked it too but I kind of missed Groot as a grown up.
Oh, I loved baby Groot!
I liked Kurt Russell's part.
Ego? Yeah, really interesting part.  I didn't see that twist coming.
No, super cold to have killed his Mom!
And to want to destroy all worlds for his ego!
Ha, ha.  I did wish the romance had progressed more.
Me too.
