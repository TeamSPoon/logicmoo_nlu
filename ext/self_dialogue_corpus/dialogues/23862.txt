Did you see that new Tom Cruise movie?
The Mummy?
Yes I think it was just called "The Mummy".
I did not like it.
I was just wondering why they chose him as the lead role.
I know, Frasier did such a swell job on the other ones.
I love Brendan Frasier in almost all the movies he has done.
I think the movie Ink Heart does not get as much credit as it should.
I thought it had such a fantastic plot.
The whole movie was one big adventure.
He does comedy really well too.
Bedazzled was funny, he plays the whole bewildered innocent cute guy well.
He did that best in Blast From the Past.
I saw that so many times.
I was kind of sad they wasted so much time in that bunker.
He does drama well too, like School Ties.
That movie really showed just how severe school can be.
He did one called Break Out too.
That is the one with the guy from Prison Break.
He has a wide range of personas he does well.
