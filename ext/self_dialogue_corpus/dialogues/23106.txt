Have you seen the new movie Get Out?
I haven't. Is it good?
I loved it!
Is it a horror movie?
It is, but it's also a black comedy.
I love black comedy movies!
I really think you'd like this one.
What's it about?
Basically a man goes with his girlfriend to meet her parents.
That doesn't sound too scary.
Well the parents are a little weird and it just goes downhill from there.
Huh that sounds kindof interesting.
It's hard to explain without giving away most of the movie.
Is it out on DVD now?
It is! You can buy it at the store nearby.
No kidding. Maybe I'll have to pick it up.
You should. I really think you'd like it.
You should come over and watch it with me.
Okay I will! I'll be by later tonight.
Okay sounds great.
