Have you seen Doctor Strange yet?
No! Remind me which one that is again?
It's a Marvel movie.  Starring Benedict Cumberbatch.
Oh of course.  I have no seen that yet, but obviously I know of it.
It's hard to keep track of all these Marvel movies, right?
Yes, definitely.  I think the last one I watched was the last Captain America movie.
Well Doctor Strange is on Netflix now.  Do you have Netflix?
Yes I do!  That's great, I guess I will try to watch that over the weekend.
Yea, good idea.  It's a really good movie.
So how do you like Cumberbatch in general as an actor?
I will be honest, I have not seen him in a lot of things.  I did enjoy that movie about Alan Turing.
The Imitation Game, right?
Yes, that one!  I really liked that movie.
Yes.  I think he's starting to get some big roles now, so he's probably going to be a massive star.
I agree.  He did a really good job in The Imitation Game.
Yes, definitely.  Portraying an actual historical figure is always tough to pull off.
Do you think going forwards he's going to do more roles like Doctor Strange, like more blockbuster type movies?
Yes, but I do not think it will diminish his career.
Yea, you are right.  The big actors these days can do huge blockbuster movies and still be considered good actors as well.
Agreed.  A guy like Matt Damon would be an example of that.
