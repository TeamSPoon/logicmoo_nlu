Mike Trout is having another amazing year for the Angels.
Yeah he is hitting .341 with 13 homes and 30 RBI's
This guy is a stud. You would think the Angels would be the cream of the crop.
Yeah, but they always seem to underachieve to me.
They are already 8 games behind the Astros for the Division.
Yeah, but the Astros are playing out of their mind right now. The season is still young.
I know but we know how this is going to play out. The Angels will underachieve and miss the postseason.
yeah as much as I want to argue with you about this, you are probably right.
I hate it for Trout though because this guy is the best their is in baseball right now.
I couldn't agree with you more. This guy is on top of baseball at this moment
He can do it all for you. A perfect combination of power and speed.
The guy is a legitimate MVP candidate every year. I enjoy watching him play
I'm sure he would enjoy playing for a contender right about now.
On the positive side they are only 1/2 game out of the last wildcare spot.
That's true. They may not be able to catch the Astros, but maybe they can sneak into the postseason.
Once you get into the postseason anything can happen. Just ask the Royals.
Yeah baseball is a game that if a team gets hot at the right time they can really take off.
I would love to see Trout in the postseason.
The guy definitely deserves to play at that level.
He is a first ballott hall of famer
