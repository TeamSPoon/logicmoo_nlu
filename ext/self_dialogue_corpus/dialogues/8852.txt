What kind of music do you like?
I still like to listen to alternative rock.
Who is your favorite band?
I don't have a true favorite.  But my all time favorite song is Don't Speak by No Doubt.
I like that song, too.
Did you notice in the video that Pat Smear appears in a cameo?
Yes, in the black and white scene.
I really wish they did more as a group.  Now Gwen is pretty much on her own.
Her success has surpassed the rest of the group.
Yes, but they were still better as a band.
