Sunday night football is at my house this week.
OK. That works for me.
Do you want to do dinner or snacks?
I will bring pizza.
Sounds good to me.
Good. See you then.
Wear your jersey. I want a picture of us together.
Ok. I will. Just for you.
Thank you sweetie.
Are you ready to see me in my element?
Yes, I love seeing you excited.
NFL football definitely excites me.
I am glad we found something we can do together.
Me too.
Who would have every thought football would be my favorite kind of date night?
I told you that you would love it.
You did. I do love it now that I am understanding it.
You have caught on quick.
I am trying. I still have a lot to learn.
That just means we watch more.
