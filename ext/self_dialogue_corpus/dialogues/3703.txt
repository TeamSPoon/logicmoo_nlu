Did you like the Exorcist?
Like it? I loved it.
Wasn't it based on a true story?
Yes it was.
That makes it even scarier.
I know it does.
I've read that some audience members fainted when they saw some of the special effects done on Linda Blair.
Yes,I've heard that too.
It kind of messed her up too I heard.
Yes,she even said that.
