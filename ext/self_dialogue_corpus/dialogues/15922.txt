I love rock n' roll too. Who is your favorite band?
Aerosmith is one of my favorite rock bands.
There one of my favorites too. What's your favorite Aerosmith album?
I'd have to say I like Toys in the Attic.
That's a classic album. Walk This Way is the best song from Toys in the Attic.
I agree Walk This Way is one of their best songs along with Dream On.
Steven Tyler and Joe Perry are two of the best rock duos.
Speaking of Joe Perry, did you know he's in a new band called Hollywood Vampires?
I didn't know that. Who else is in the band?
Alice Cooper is also part of Hollywood Vampires.
I didn't know Joe Perry and Alice Cooper were in a band together.
They formed Hollywood Vampires in 2015. They do a lot of rock song covers.
Awesome! What rock band covers have they did?
The did a cover of Motorhead's Ace of Spades.
Really? That sounds like it was awesome.
They performed it at 2016 Grammys.
I need to listen to Hollywood Vampires. They seem like a rock group I'd like.
You won't be disappointed. Alice Cooper and Joe Perry are great together.
