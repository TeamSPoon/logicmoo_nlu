What is the best spell in Harry Potter?
Hmmm, Accio....the summoning charm. You could get stuff without having to get off your bed!
Accio, milk and cookies! Yeah that would be cool. How about stupefy? Stunning spells would be awesome.
Yeah, like when you hear annoying people complaining. I could use that. How about petrificus totalus! Now you're statue.
Sweet! I could use that one. What about the bat boogey hex?
I got someone in mind for that one!
Yeah, me too. I could have used that the other day. How about ascendio? You could fly over a stadium or concert and watch from there!
Yeah that would be cool. I could get in to that!
Confundo! Confuse and disorient to get out of jobs. That would be excellent.
Yeah too bad my wand is in the shop.
