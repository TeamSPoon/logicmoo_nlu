You're a metal fan, right?
Absolutely.
Do you still see it as a sub-genre of rock?
To a degree, yes I do. Without rock, there would be no metal.
Then why say to a degree?
Because metal is very much it's own thing these days. It even has it's own sub-genres.
I've heard it might even have more than rock itself.
Maybe. Rock has ones like punk, grunge, alternative, indie, stoner, rockabilly, and some others.
What does metal have?
Thrash metal, death metal, black metal, doom metal, metalcore, deathcore, sludge metal, grindcore, and so many others. There's a lot.
