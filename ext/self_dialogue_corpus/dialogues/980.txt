Are you a football fan?
I am. It's one of my favorite sports.
Yeah, me, too. I'm a big Cowboys fan.
Yeah, I like them. I tend to support the home team, wherever I live.
Oh, you do? So you're a Steelers fan right now?
Yeah, I'm a big supporter.
I've always liked them, too.
And I used to be a Green Bay fan when I lived in Wisconsin.
You like what Mike McCarthy has been doing with them?
I do. I think he's been inspirational to the team.
What other teams do you like?
I'm a fan of the Rams, even though their history has been spotty.
Yeah, Sean McVay has his work cut out for him.
Speaking of California, what do you think of the Raiders?
Awful team. I mean, they haven't had a championship since 1984.
Maybe the move to Las Vegas will alleviate that a bit.
Maybe. I don't know if Vegas is the best place for them.
Who knows? Couldn't be worse than Oakland.
I guess it's up to Jack Del Rio.
Guess so, yeah.
