So who do you like better, Iron Maiden or Metallica?
That's easy. Iron Maiden!
What is it about their music that makes them superior to Metallica, for you?
Well, they're a lot more consistent and never watered down their sound for commercial appeal.
That's true! They don't really have a "Black Album" or a "Load" in their discography.
Yeah, Iron Maiden have set a high standard for themselves musically, and their music is creative too.
We tend to forget how influential they really were.
Yes, their dual-lead-guitar sound is pretty incredible, in how the guitars interlock and harmonize.
Metallica had some great albums and songs, for sure, but their music to me is not as intelligent.
Yeah, I think people who appreciate all sorts of music will get a lot more out of Iron Maiden than Metallica.
