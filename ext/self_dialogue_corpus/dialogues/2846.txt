Going to see your Packers during the season?
Yes, my buddy and I have tickets to the December 3rd gsame in Tampa.
Tampa is an up and coming team. Can the Pack beat them?
The Pack can beat anybody on any given day. Just depends on getting a little defense.
What team do you dislike the most?
I would say the Bears as their fans are nasty.
What makes you say that?
I've been to games in Chicago when the Pack kicked butt and the fans threw stuff at us Packer fans.
How are the Bears treated when they go to Green Bay?
Packer fans are very knowledgeable. 99.9% are well behaved.
Who is your favorite current Packer?
I would say Aaron Rodgers.
Why is he your favorite?
Because he makes spectacular plays out of broken plays.
How do you think they will do this year.
If they can stay somewhat healthy, they should win their division.
Who is the biggest rival in their division?
Most people say the Bears but, I think it is the Vikings.
Can they get to the big game this year?
Sure, as long as Rodgers stays healthy and they get a bit of defense.
