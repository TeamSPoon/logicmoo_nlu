What are your thoughts on superhero movies?
I like them. They're always a fun time.
Personally, I'm getting a little sick of them.
Really? They're all different though - how can you be sick of them?
They don't really seem that different to me. They all start to blend together.
There have been a lot of superhero movies in the last decade.
For example, I have no recollection of Age of Ultron.
I didn't really care for that one. The fight scene was really boring.
Every movie it just seems like there's a bad guy, they fight him, they win.
It is a little formulaic.
Even some of the recent ones that try to do something unique are the same.
I really enjoyed Wonder Woman, though. Gal Gadot was great.
I appreciate that they're trying to do something different by having a female lead, but I was still bored by it.
Even though I like the movies, something REALLY different would be appreciated.
Yeah, like what about one where the bad guy wins?
Or what if the whole time, the bad guy was the good guy?
Exactly! There aren't a lot of shades of grey when it comes to superhero movies.
That's something they're desperately lacking.
And it can't just be a small analysis by the fans.
I agree, it needs to be at the forefront of the movie.
