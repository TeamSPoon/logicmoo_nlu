I need a good playlist for the car, I am going on a trip
what kind of genres do you like
O like all really, rap and hard rock are my least favorite
How about on the road again by willie nelson
Thats hilarious, I love it
How about "we are the road crew" by ace of spades
another great one, keep them coming
homeward bound by simon and garfunkel?
Love it, anything more recent?
“Keep the Car Running” by Arcade Fire?
great, thank you
where are you headed?
Arizona
work or pleasure?
sadly for work, but I do get a day to enjoy the sights.
I bet they will have a music festival there
now that is something I could enjoy
Have you been before?
yes, but not in a few years
Have a safe trip
