Have you heard Imagine Dragon's new song yet?
Is it the one called Walking The Wire?
Yeah, that's the song! Do you like it?
It's pretty good. I liked some of the older songs better.
I've been a fan since I heard Radioactive back in 2012.
Radioactive is my favorite song of theirs.
I think that was their big hit that made them get so popular.
I had never heard of them until that song started playing on the radio all the time.
I hadn't either. After that when they released Demons as a single, I was sure I was hooked.
It showed they had more range.
Yeah, it made me buy their album, Night Visions, to see what else they could do.
Oh, you got their album? How are their songs besides the radio singles?
I think they're great, really creative. I could listen to them nonstop.
Maybe I'll check out some more of their songs.
You should. If you like them, you might like Neon Trees too.
I'm not sure I've heard of them. What songs do they have?
They released a song called Animal that topped the charts in 2010, I think
Oh, Animal, I've heard that song! Are they good?
They're fantastic. I can lend you their album. It's really different stuff, sort of between alternative rock and pop, but they're really fun to listen to.
Thanks. I look forward to hearing more from them. Their first song was huge!
