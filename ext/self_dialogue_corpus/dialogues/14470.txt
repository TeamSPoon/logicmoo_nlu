Why was the western conference so bad this year?
Its hard to say normally we see this sort of play out of the East
Do you think its just spreading to the NBA?
As in it being too top heavy?
Yeah just about that.
I can see where people think that it is a very top heavy league.
Some of the teams are playing like crap to be honest.
The Clippers had a very strange year.
And the Mavericks were terrible
You could see the direction they were headed though in the beginning of the season.
They are still relying on Nowitzki.
At some point they have to move on
I just dont see them doing that ever
So he retires on his own terms?
That and hes probably going to do it in the middle of a season.
I dont know how he maintains it
I think he wants to break records
At the behest of his franchise?
I admit its selfish
He will always be the greatest euro player
