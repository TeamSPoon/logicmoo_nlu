Are you excited for the ne Cars 3 movie?
Not really. I didn't like the second one.
You didn't? I thought Cars 1 and 2 were great.
I really loved Cars 1. I don't know, maybe Cars 3 will be a good movie.
What did you not like about Cars 2?
It didn't really grab my attention as well as the first one.
I see. Well, I cannot wait to see Cars 3.
Are you excited for any other movies coming out?
Yes, I also can't wait for Wreck It Ralph 2.
Me neither! That is going to be a great movie!
