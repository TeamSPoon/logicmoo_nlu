Cinderella was such a good movie, I loved her slippers.
I know, I wish glass slippers were a real thing!
Seriously, I would buy a pair for sure! I wish I had birds that could sew for me.
That would be nice, her step sisters were so ugly
They were, with warts all over their faces
They had such big feet also, Cinderella was so pretty
I know, it was sad how she was treated
It was, I am glad she got to live happily ever after
with all of her animal friends !
That was such a cute part of the movie.
