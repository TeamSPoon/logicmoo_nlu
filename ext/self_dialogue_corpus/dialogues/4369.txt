What do you think are the best thriller movies in the last, four or so years?
That is a long list.
Which movie would be at the top?
I would have to say Ex-Machina.
I have not even heard of it.
It is a real edge of your seat, keep you guessing type.
Is it about crime?
In a way. But more about AI.
Like Robots?
Yep, there is even a dance scene.
