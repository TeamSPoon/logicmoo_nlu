Would you see a movie based on Tiger Woods life?
No I think it would be terrible.
It has a thickening plot line.
I dont think they should exploit his tribulations.
Thats what movies are all about.
I think you can go in other directions.
Would people watch what would be a golf movie.
No I think thats another reason why the film would be bad.
I think they would be drawn to see his decline.
Some people love that stuff.
But is Hollywood that trashy?
Anything to make a dime.
It would be like making a film based on the Kardashians.
I am sure they are set to produce something like that.
There are boundaries I dont think they want to cross.
Thats not true its all about filth sometimes.
But do they have juicy enough stories
No, but Hollywood is starting to just film reality TV.
They have enough creative minds to not go that way
All the films coming out are just remakes anymore
