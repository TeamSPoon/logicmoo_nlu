Do you know what kind of music your parents like best?
No, I don't. That's kind of a strange question.
Not really. It's kind of interesting to think about.
How so?
I think sometimes there's a tendency to think about your parents as 'parents', not as people. But they are just like anyone else.
I guess that's true. I know my mom was a big fan of the Beatles.
Just like every mom and dad of around that age!
That's true. My dad was big into Motown, I think.
Ohh, like Marvin Gaye and the Temptations, groups like that?
Yeah, he definitely liked the Temptations.
My parentes were huge Deadheads.
Haha, I never would have pictured that.
Yep. They followed the Grateful Dead on tour for 3 months at one point.
I'm never going to be able to look at your parents the same way!
It's funny how music is such a signifier of lifestyle and personality.
Yeah, especially with a band like the Grateful Dead.
Yep, they're probably the number one 'lifestyle' band out there.
I still can't believe your parents were Deadheads.
It took some getting used to for me, too!
I'm glad my parents stuck with Marvin Gaye and the Beatles.
