Have you listened to the Chili Pepper's last album?
Yeah, I listed to if it's the one from last year.
The last by the Red Hot Chili Peppers is called The Get Away.
Oh yeah, that's the one.  It came out in 2016.
Did you hear what Morrisey said about the terrorist attack in the UK?
I did.  He said that political correctness in not calling out radical Islam is getting people killed.
I recommend that you listen to the latest my Maroon 5.
How many times have you told me that?  Ok, ok, I will.
It seems like all that station plays is Bruno Mars.
I know, I'm sick of it.  I'm going to lose that preset.
I was really surprised that Lady Gaga didn't get all political at the Superbowl.
Me too, I thought for sure she would join the rest of the idiots in the hate Trump or die mantra.
It seems like Linkin Park has lost their edge.
It's either that or you're just getting tired of their style of music.
Katy Perry is just so overrated.
It's like Frank Zappa said, the record industry is ran by 13 year-old girls.
I saw Van Halen back in the day live in Detroit.
Is that the one where they were almost too drunk to play?
Do you remember when we were roommates and we saw ZZ Top twice on the same tour?
Yeah, those were the days, I don't know how we afforded tickets.
