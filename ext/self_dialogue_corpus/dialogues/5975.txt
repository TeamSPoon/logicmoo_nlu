I really like the movie Fantasia. I hadn't watched it for years until last night.
I haven't seen that movie in ages.
I love the different scenes and the music just makes it epic.
Isn't there a part with dinosaurs in that movie?
Yes, it's kind of the story of how they come to be and then go extinct.
Really, it covers that much?
Yeah, it was really interesting. Also, the part with the dancing mushrooms is awesome.
I remember that! I loved that one and then the part with the dancing hippos!
That part was great too! It makes me want to watch Fantasia 2000.
Oh, I almost forgot there was another one!
