Are you looking forward to the NFL season?
No, I am not really a sports fan, but the rest of my family are rabid fans.
Oh, that's right, doesn't your Aunt adore the Vikings?
Yes. She passed away two months ago and we had her Vikings hat and an autographed, hand written letter from her favorite Viking on display at the wake.
That's sweet. You should watch a game in memory of her.
I would consider going to the new stadium, I hear it's really beautiful.
Do you know anyone who has been there?
Yes. Every year my cousins pool their money and buy season tickets and rotate who gets them for each game.
Cool.
The very first game that was played there was a pre-season game against the Packers.
The Vikings arch rivals!
Yes. And my cousin Jimmy had first go at the tickets this year.
Did he like the game?
He didn't see it, but yes, he LOVED the game.
What do you mean?
There was such a high demand for tickets since it was the first ever game in the new stadium and it was against our arch rivals he sold the tickets and pocketed $16,000.
WOW!
I don't know how anyone can afford to see a pro game of any sport these days.
I know, the prices are outrageous.
Thank God for farm teams.
