Dude, football season is comming up.
I know.  OTA's are starting.  Who's your team?
I like the Broncos.
Aw man, Im a radiers fan haha.  Looks like we have to hate each other now!
Right?  I'm not that big of a fan since Peyton retired.
Yea, he was good.  Im glad Carr is gonna be healthy all year.
He's good.  If he didnt get knocked out in the playoffs last year, I think the Radiers had a shot at the Super Bowl.
I think so too.  Be those freaking Patriots again.
I know.  I wanted Atlanta to win so bad.
They had it too, man.  They were up so much at the half.
Im telling you, man.....I think the NFL is rigged.
I think so too.  Goodell is crooked.
No one likes him.  You think he would know and stop all his BS
Yea.  He hasnt done a good job.
So you think Lynch is gonna be just like old Beast Mode again?
I hope so!  He retired young, so he can still be good.
What about AP?  You think he'll be a big back again?
Which Brees at QB, he'll get a lot of looks.  He might get 2000 yards again.
Who do you think will take it this year?
Raiders, baby!
