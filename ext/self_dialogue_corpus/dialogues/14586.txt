Are you watching the NBA playoffs?
Yes, the San Antonio Spurs beat the Houston Rockets pretty badly!
I think the Rockets would have done better if James Harden played better tonight.
Yes, he played well during the regular season, but did not perform as well during the playoffs.
Now that they beat the Rockets, how do you think the Spurs will do against the Golden State Warriors?
Both teams are excellent.  That is why they are the first and second seeds in the Western Conference.
I think Golden State will win.  They swept the Utah Jazz easily to get here.
Well, Golden State did win 67 games in the regular season.
Stephen Curry has made Golden State a team that always wins a lot.
But San Antonio won 61 games this season.  They are also very strong.
Kawhi Leonard has done very well for San Antonio.
I think the Warriors win in 6 games, but it will be a close series.
I see the Golden State Warriors winning the championship too.
I agree.  I think the Cleveland Cavaliers will be their opponents in the finals.
Cleveland will win the Eastern Conference, but either the Spurs or the Warriors will beat them.
I think Cleveland just needs more strong players besides Lebron James.
But Kyrie Irving is a another good player for the Cleveland Cavaliers.
Yes, but he is very young.  He will be better when he is older.
Either way, I cannot wait to see who plays in the 2017 NBA Finals.
Me too.  2017 has been a great year to watch basketball.
