Do you have a favorite football team in the NFL?
Not really.
Why not?
I like a lot of teams.
They do have lots of talent out there.
I guess I would say the Bears if I had to narrow it down.
Who is your favorite all time Bear player?
I think that Refrigerator Perry tops the list.
I would agree.
He was top on the field.
No one could get past him.
Who else is your favorite all timer?
I liked Jim McMahon.
He was quite a quarterback.
Those were the days.
There are some real stars today, but I loved football back then.
Nothing like it.
You bet.
I would have loved to see those players in person.
That would have rocked.
