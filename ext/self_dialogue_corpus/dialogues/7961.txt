Do you like Selena Gomez?
I'm not the biggest Selena Gomez fan. You know I like hardcore rock music.
What about as far as pop music goes though?
I guess she's alright. I'm not sure I know many of her songs.
You have to know the one that just came out this summer!
I'm not sure I do, what's it called?
It's called "It Ain't Me."
No, I haven't heard it before.
Are you sure? They play it all the time on the radio these days.
Maybe I'd recognize it if I heard it.
