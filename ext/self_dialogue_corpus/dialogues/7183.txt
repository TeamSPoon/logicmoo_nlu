Have you seen the Disney movie "The Good Dinosaur?" It came out last year and I just watched it again last night.
I love that movie, Arlo is the coolest dinosaur. I cried like a baby when I first watched it.
Spot and Arlo are both so similar. They have similar problems with not fitting in in their lives.
I agree, I think that they teach each other about life and help each other through their struggles.
The movie wasn't very popular, it's not very talked about, but I think its one of the best new Disney movies out there.
I think so too, it i an emotional roller coaster with comedy, action, and drama.
I love showing my kids this movie because it makes them understand that even though you may be a little slow or a little different you can still succeed.
Yeah, especially if you have a friend to help you out through the tough times.
I wish I had someone like Arlo when I was younger, I always felt like the outcast.
Me too, "The Good Dinosaur" is such a heartwarming film and it never fails to make me feel happy.
