So then what is a "movie" in your view?
I don't think we should go back as far as the beginning of the motion photography in order to discuss what a movie is, That's just goes too far
Ok, then how far back is necessary?
I wouldn't even go back to silent motion picture era.
And, now you're just being stupid. Don't be silly. of course we have to include the silent pictures
How do you figure that?
Well, one of the greatest actors bridged both the silent and sound era. Chalie Chaplin
So?
Now you're just being stubborn. if our definition of movies do not include silent picture becaue you don't like it, then  Charlie Chaplin is one the greatest actor of all time!
I am totally Ok with that.
There is no talking with you.
Ok Fine, then what do you say a movie is?
A movie is an art form, by consensus, most film historian agree that the very first movie was introduced around 1900
That's a convenient, nice, rounded number.
Well up until that point, the footages were quite limited, it wasn't until 1896, when melles built his studio and began distributing short films, that the industry really took shape.
Well, i've never heard of Melles.
Have you heard of "A trip to the moon?"
No.
I really have no idea why I even started this conversation with you...
I have no idea either. And I still think silent movies aren't even movies and they suck.
