What do you think about the movie 'Pocahontas' from the 1990's?
I enjoyed it when it came out.
I just saw it, and I was a little disappointed.
Why, what was the disappointment for you?
Well I thought that it was disrespectful to Native Americans.
Oh, I didn't catch that when I was a child watching it.
Plus it got a lot of the history and facts wrong from that colonization period.
Well that's to be expected of a kid's movie.
I guess you're right, because they don't want to be too gritty or realistic for the kid's sake.
Yes, they need to keep a softer tone for the young ones until they can understand the complexities of history.
