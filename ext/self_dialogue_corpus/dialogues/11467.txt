Did you know John Lennon from the Beatles loved cats? He had ten of them when he lived with his first wife Cynthia.
Can you imagine having ten cats? That is a lot of kitty litter.
I know, his mother had a cat named "Elvis" she was a huge Elvis fan.
Paul McCartney said, John Lennon was drunk the first time they met.
John and Paul wrote the song "Little Man" together.
They also wrote,"I Wanna Be Your Man" together.
I loved that song. Did Ringo Starr write any of their songs?
I think he wrote, "Don't Pass Me By"
I am pretty sure all of them were song writers. I know George Harrison wrote quite a few songs when the Beatles broke up.
"My Sweet Lord" was one of them.
