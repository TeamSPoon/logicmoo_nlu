I wonder what the earliest musical instrument is.
That's easy. Human voice.
That's not an instrument.
Well, what is a musical instrument? A device? Or a tool? Does it have to be fabricated? Human voice has been used to make music for all of humanity for all we know.
Yes, yes, but to be an instrument, it has to be fabricated.
Then the earliest "discovered" musical instrument is a flute made of ivory found in Germany. It was dated to 42,000 years ago.
That's pretty old, I wonder what notes it makes
That's a great question. Not sure. They should really do a study on the pitch of the flute. It will be so interesting.
I wonder if there are academics who specialize on such things.
I'm sure there are, but I have no idea what they're called.
Maybe musical ethnographic history.
You just made that up
Yes, but sounds likely.
i think some of what we know about ancient musical scales from mostly from Greece.
Interesting. How did they figure that?
well, they have records of how the tones were produced. it's called systema teleion.
Why do you know these things?
They're interesting tidbits of history. anyway. The major breakthrough in music theory came by the way of the mathematician Pythagoras.
The triangle guy?
yes. The triangle guy. He figured out that the frequency of a vibrating string is proportional to the inverse of the length of the string. Generating the scales from that is just dividing the string arithmetically. 1:1 is unison, 2:1 is the octave, 3:2 is the fifth, 4:3 is the fourth and so on.
