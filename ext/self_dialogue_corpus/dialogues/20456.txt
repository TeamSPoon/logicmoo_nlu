So I just got through watching Trailer Park Boys " Don't Legalize it."
What did you think of it?
It had its funny moments.
You might like itbetter if you follow the show.
maybe. I liked the drunk trailer park supervisor. He was hilarious
I love that part when his partner throws the cocaine out the window and he pulls into the gas station in a hurrya and makes dude give up his underwear to sniff out the cocaine.
Oh my gosh Randy Bo Bandi is one of my favorite characters. Hookin' for cheeseburgers, man gotta eat!
I felt so sorry for Bubbles, living under J-roc's porch slinging chicken and swish for a living.
You know, fun fact, he can only wear those glasses like 15 minutes at a time or he gets severe headaches?
I imagine so, those things are thick!
Phil Collins didn't play a big role in it like I had hoped. I swear I laugh so hard when the bottle kids hit his gut and he lets out that big mackerl burp.
That is hysterical, gets me everytime. I heard he passed away.
Really? when/
Sometime in 2016
Jeez, 2016 claims another great. Wonder what he died from?
There is no telling. Julian was greasy in this one
He is greasy in all of their movies.
But selling urine? That is greasy on an epic level.
At least Bubbles got a piece of his parents back
i was so worried that he was leaving the show/movies. I was on the edge of my seat.
