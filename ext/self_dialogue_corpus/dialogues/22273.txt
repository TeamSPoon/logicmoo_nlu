We saw this awesome movie the other day.
What was it?
Interstellar.
Oh yes. It's been out for a while, no?
Yes, it's a few years old but we had never seen it before.
So you guys liked it?
It was amazing! Such a beautiful, touching movie,
Yeah, I really liked it too when I saw it. Matthew McConaughey is so good in that.
Isn't he? I always like him, but in Interstellar, he really got me.
The moment where he is watching a video of his son with his newborn, and so much time has passed...
Oh God... That killed me!
Yeah, it was amazingly touching.
I know... And I really liked the pace of the movie too.
Yes. It does take time to establish things. And there are so many things to consider in that story.
Yes, it's very complex, and they get it right. It could have been confusing, but they managed to nail it.
Totally. And I really liked Anne Hathaway as well. I don't get why people don't like her.
It's just a stupid fad. People don't think by themselves. She is great.
I loved her in Rachel Getting Married.
Oh yeah! That was a good movie!
And she was really good in it.
