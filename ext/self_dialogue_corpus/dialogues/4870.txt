What did they use in the beginning?
What?
For the ball, they didn't have manufactured baseballs back in the days. So what did they use?
Depends no how far we go back. There have been many bat and ball games throughout the history.
In the US. For the game of baseball. What ball did they use, and how did they make it?
The earliest mentioning of the game was back in 1791 when they passs an ordinance banning the game within 80 yards from the town house.
How do you know that but not know what the ball was made of?
I didn't say I didn't know what the ball was made of, just that there have been many other bat and ball games.
in the US. the game of baseball. How was it made.
The very fist, recognizable, and recorded game of baseball was in the year 1846.
That's not telling me how it's made
I'm getting there. Like I said, there have been many bat and ball games everywhere. And the common method of making the ball included a rubber core, wrapped using yarn and leather
That's not too different from a modern baseball
No it really isn't, and it wasn't too uncommon for the leather covering to come apart upon being struck.
Hah, just like you see in cartoons.
Yep. It wasn't until 1850s in New York, that they tried to standardize the ball weight, size, etc. But it wasn't until 1876 that AG Spalding convinced the the National league to adopt his balls.
Spalding as in the sporting equipment guy?
Yep. he was a picther and pretty good one at that, and he happened to make his own balls, and thought that his was better than others, and the NL agreed, and the ball remained for the next century.
What happened n 1976?
The MLB decided to go with Rawlings, and that's why we have Rawlings logo on the balls and that's why.
