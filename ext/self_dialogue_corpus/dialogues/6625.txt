What did you think of the new Beauty and the Beast movie with Emma Watson?
To be honest, I didn't really care for it.
Really? Why not?
Well, Belle is supposed to be the most beautiful girl in the entire village.
Okay.. And??
Well, I don't find Emma Watson to be all that beautiful.
Why not? I think she's very pretty.
Oh, I don't think she's ugly. But there were tons of people throughout the movie that are more attractive than her.
Well, she's a popular actress so that's probably why she was cast for the part. She's also a good actress on top of being well liked.
Yeah, I suppose that's true. I was just disappointed, is all.
