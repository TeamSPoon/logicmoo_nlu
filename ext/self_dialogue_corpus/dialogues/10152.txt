I heard The Mummy was filled with action scenes.
Oh yeah the special effects were great.
How did Tom Cruise do?
Hes always good in these types of movies.
I am surprised he would do this kind of film
Why he does action films all the time.
Yeah but a remake that wasnt bad?
You always want to put your spin on things.
I think he made the role his.
It did terrible at the box office.
