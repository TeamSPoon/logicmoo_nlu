Have you ever heard of a movie called Battle Royale?
Yea it's based off of the book right?
Yea! That's the one.
Yea I've seen it, but I was really disappointed.
Me too, the book was much more intense.
It's a cool premise for a thriller, a bunch of kids having to kill eachother.
Yea, in fact they are making an American version of it, but in an office building.
I guess kids killing eachother would be too much these days.
I think it just makes a more interesting story to do it in a closed office space.
Yea, it's easier to make a movie about it since the area isn't huge like in the book.
