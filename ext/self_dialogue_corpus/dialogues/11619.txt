Hey, I was listening to the radio yesterday and i heard "Yesterday."
How ironic...do you like the Beatles then?
Yes, I remember my brothers listening to them when I was growing up.
yes, that's funny, me too. My sister loves Sergeant Pepper's album/
That is  a good one.  When I was a kid, my dad brought home the White Album.  I had never seen a white record before!
That has "While my guitar gently weeps" right?
Yes, George Harrison was an amazing talent.
True, he and John lennon were the most talented of the four.
I adore John, although I despise yoko of course.
Well, she broke them up, so I can understand that.
