I went and  saw  split  yesterday .
Is that the one about the  guy  with  alot of   different personalties ?
It is  and he  kidnaps a   few young  girls .
So  does  he  seem  belivable  as  so many  different personalities ?
He does in a  way the only one  I  struggled  with was one  where he  was  called the  beast
Did it  cross over into  any of the other movies like  signs ?
In the  end  you do  see  bruce  willis  character  from unbreakable
So  are they going to  do  one  crossing  all these  stories  together  ?
I think they could  it  would  just be  very hard  .
We  will just have  to  wait  and  see then
