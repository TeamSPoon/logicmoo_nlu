So, were you ever into the "nu metal era" of music?
Yes, it's kind of embarrassing how much I used to be into it.
I think a lot of people were. It took the world by storm.
What bands did you used to listen to back then?
I used to love Slipknot.
I always thought their masks were so scary. Their music was good, though.
Yeah when "Iowa" came out I remember thinking it was the angriest release ever.
I used to play the song "Left Behind" on repeat.
The chorus to that song is so catchy.
They were unique and had a lot of shock value.
Their vocalist also is in Stone Sour. They're very different musically.
Yeah, I know. I think they're both good.
I agree. It shows how diverse Corey Taylor is as a musician.
Did you ever listen to Korn back then?
Of course I did. Korn was awesome.
I actually liked them more than Slipknot. The sound was more relatable to me.
Jonathan Davis has a very unique voice.
He does. They have a lot of really good songs.
Their old albums are awesome. I haven't liked many of their newer songs.
Me either. It seems like they're trying too hard now with the electronic elements.
