I heard baseball is trying to speed up their games.
I heard that, too. It is about time they did something.
They made several changes recently that have helped. Like automatically throwing out pitches that hit the dirt.
That helped. And I also like that a pitcher can now go to their mouths without stepping off the mound.
The next proposal is to allow an intentional walk without having to throw 4 pitches. I wish they would do that.
No way! They should have to throw the pitches. What if one is a wild pitch?
Wild pitch? That never happens. It would help speed up the game. They should do it.
I still disagree. What baseball should do is prevent batters from getting out of the batter's box between pitches.
I can go along with that. It is just a waste of time and does not help the batter.
I bet that would shave about 20 minutes off each game.
Right. So far, the changes have not amount to a lot of time saving.
Here is another time saver. The catcher can only talk to the pitcher once an inning.
Again, I must agree. Most times the catcher goes out is to confer about the signs, which they should have already gotten straight.
Yeah, professional baseball players should have learned to get their signals straight without having to visit the mound.
Great we have sped the game up! I really hope they continue limiting reviews, or we will end up with 5 hour games!
Right, like in football games where it seems like every play has be reviewed.
I hate that. It really makes watching football painful.
Overall, I give baseball a better grade than the other sports on review.
I agree. Basketball is getting as bad as football.
Baseball is still the best professional sport.
