Who is your favorite Batman?
What do you mean?
Is it Michael Keaton, Val Kilmer, Adam West, George Clooney, or Chrisitan Bale?
I would have to go with Chrisitan Bale.
He did a really good job in 'The Dark Knight' movies.
Who's your favorite?
I think it's Michael Keaton.
Why is he your favorite?
He played the character just right to me.
He did have the understated and mysterious quality down.
