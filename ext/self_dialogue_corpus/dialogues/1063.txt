The Cowboys offensive line is incredible.
Well, they are pretty good.
Pretty good?  They're like the Golden State Warriors of OL's.
When you spend high picks on them all, of course they are going to be.
Yeah, but they weren't all that high.
They were all first rounders.
Yeah, but we're not talking all top ten picks here.
I think Tyron Smith was.
He was, but Martin was in the teens I think.
That's really high for a guard.
And Frederick was a first rounder.
At the end of the first round I think.
Yeah, and if you remember, everyone hated the pick.
It was an odd pick.
Just because they thought he was overdrafted by a round or two.
It was a steep price for a center.
Steep price?  He's a perennial Pro Bowler.
No, I get that, just saying it was still a first round pick they had to burn.
In any event, you can't deny that they are a talented group.
We'll see how they do without Leary and Free this year.
