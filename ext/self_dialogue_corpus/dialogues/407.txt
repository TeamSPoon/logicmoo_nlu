Wonder if they're going to make a Flash movie.
Me too. It seems like they should.
Yeah, there have been a couple TV shows.
Are you following the latest one?
I've seen a few episodes.
I can't get enough!
Maybe I'll have to check it out again.
I wonder who they got for the Justice League movie.
I'm not sure. I can't really see him in the trailers.
I hope the movie is alright.
