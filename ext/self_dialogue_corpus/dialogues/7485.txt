Did you ever feel in the Order of the Phoenix that Harry would end up with Luna?
You mean because of the ending of that one?
It was such a cute moment, and I thought for sure it meant that Harry and Luna would have a thing later on.
They were both from too sad of a background I think. But, I did like that moment.
There were some really small moments in the films that always got me.
I liked when Mr. Weasly was so excited to ask Haryy questions.
And he was so happy, he just over looked the fact that Harry was more of less a famous guy.
When he asked " What exactly is the purpose of a rubber ducky?", I crack up every time!
I think he was one of the best. He always made the show feel lighter.
I loved when he just left the flying car sitting around. Like it was a normal machine.
