Did you see Psycho?
Yes.
Is it as thrilling as everyone says?
Yes and no. It's older, so while there are some jump scares, it's not horror.
So it's psychological?
Yeah, there's a bunch of stuff in that movie never shown before on screen.
Like what?
Cross-dressing, a dead mother, and even a toilet flushing!
Those are nothing.
True, but this came out in 1960.
