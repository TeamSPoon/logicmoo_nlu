Did you ever see the second Fast and the Furious short film?
You mean 2Fast2Furious?
No, there was a short called Los Bandoleros in 2009.
Which movie did it come out closest to?
I believe Fast & Furious.
No I have not seen or even heard of that.
It mainly featured Sung Kang and some Vin.
I will check that out sometime.
You should, it was not bad at all.
I will, thanks for the recommendation.
