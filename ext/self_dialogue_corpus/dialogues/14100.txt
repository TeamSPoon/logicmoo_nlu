what do you think about artpop?
i love it
really? i dont think the critics liked it that much
who cares what they think?
that is true. everybody has their opinions.
i loved dope and do what you want
do what you want was so weird....especially because it featured r kelly.
yeah, not a great choice considering his record.
but it still made for a catchy song.
it sure did
