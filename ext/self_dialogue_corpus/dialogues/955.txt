Hey, which team do you think will be the biggest surprise of the season in the NFL?
I think the Browns have a decent chance this year.
They'er always so bad!!!
I know, but this year might be the year they get things together.
How are they going to pull it off?
Well, hopefully their off season acquisitions and new signings will help.
I think it will take much more than that, though.
I agree, their coaching staff will have to put in a lot of work.
Well, they do have some talent, but probably not enough.
I agree that it might be another building year, but they have some pieces to work with.
I can understand that, hopefully injuries will not be a problem.
All NFL teams have to deal with injuries, unfortunately.
Yes, and luck plays a pretty big factor in team success.
I agree, but given a clean slate of health - the Browns may surprise some people.
Well then I will be on the lookout for them then!
You heard it hear first!
I personally think that the Jets have a shot to make a splash.
Yes, they did shake up their coaching staff within the last couple years.
It will be another year of building on what they are now establishing.
This year - we may see many surprises in the NFL.
