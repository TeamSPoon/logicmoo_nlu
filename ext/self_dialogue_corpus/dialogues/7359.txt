The Parent Trap was such a cool movie
I liked that they ended up at the same summer camp that  was cool
did you know in the original they used a mirror image of the same girl?
No I did not know that
yes, they did not have the technology back then like we do now
That makes it even cooler now that I think of it
and how they got their parents back together? so cute!
But who separates twins like that?
seriously, that is kind of messed up
they should have kept them together
