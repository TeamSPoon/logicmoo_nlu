What’s your favorite scary movie of late?
That’s a hard question to answer, so many to choose from. I would say IT Follows.
That’s a good one, very scary!
Yes, it was filmed really well also, some of scenery is very realistic of small town.
Yes and the story is kind of unique also, I don’t think anything has been done quite like that.
Agreed, it was different. Have you seen Get Out?
No I have not, but I have heard good things about it.
I think I if you like horror and mysteries, it’s a good mixture of the two.
That’s what I hear, it looked really good in the trailer that I saw.
Trust me, you would not be disappointed.
