Which animated movie do you think is the best?
It is definitely Wreck-It Ralph. It's great for all ages.
That movie is great! The video game sequences are so nostalgic.
I agree! Inside Out is a close second though.
I used that movie to teach my kids how to manage their emotions.
That's a great idea! I just love how the humor is perfect for all ages.
What about classics like Mulan and Beauty and the Beast?
The old versions are great, but have you seen the remake of Beauty and the Beast?
Yes! Emma Watson was incredible.
I've heard that Disney is planning on remaking many more!
I saw that the remake of Mulan is coming in 2018. That should be exciting!
Yes, I hope they keep all of the musical aspects like they did in Beauty and the Beast!
What did you think of movies like Tangled and Frozen?
I actually prefer Tangled because I feel it has a better story line.
What? The songs from Frozen are timeless!
The music in Frozen was amazing, but I found the action sequences to be lacking.
I guess I can see that.
What sequel are you most looking forward to?
That's easy! I'm counting down the days until Wreck-It Ralph 2.
I agree! We need to go and buy pre-sale tickets as soon as possible.
