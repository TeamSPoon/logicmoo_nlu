What would change about the star wars movies of you could?
I would have put them out in chronological order.
Really? That would have ruined the reveal of darth vader as luke's father.
Yes that is a draw back but seems confusing to me them being made they were. what would you change?
I wish I could have been there to stop lucas from using CGi too much in the newer episode 1, 2,3,.
Ya, it was not as believable as the costumes for the storm troopers.
That was my major complaint of that series overall. he got too carried away with the cgi.
Agreed, so glad the newest ones seem to have realized his errors and improved on them,
Ya, the cgi they use now is tasteful and really amazing, for example carrie fischer young again at the end.
That was so believable, don't think they could have done that any better!
