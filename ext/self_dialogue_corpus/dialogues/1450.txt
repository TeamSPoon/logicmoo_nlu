What do you think about the NFL this year?
I think the league is too stacked for certain teams
Which teams?
Mostly those in the AFC north
Who specifically? I can't think of any
The Patriots and Ravens obviously!
Oh I suppose about the Patriots but the Ravens aren't very good
They are too
Wait, aren't they your favorite team?
Maybe..
So you're a bit biased here?
Alright full disclosure, yes, I've been a Ravens fan for years
Well i guess that makes sense, they did win the superbowl recently
I was a Raven's fan long before they won the superbowl
Well then I guess that makes you a real fan
I hate it when people cheer for only the best teams in the league
Those are called bandwagon fans I believe
I hate those kind of fans
Oh well I hope your team does well, I don't particularly watch football
Thanks! I hope the Ravens end up winning the superbowl
