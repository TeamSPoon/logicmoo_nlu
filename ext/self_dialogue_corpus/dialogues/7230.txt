hey i just got done watching peter pan
oh i remember that movie, why did you just watch it?
i was bored and had never seen it before
oh really? what did you think?
it was good, it was cool how they flew through the sky
yeah that was a good scene, i liked captain hook
but he was the bad guy how could you?
true but he was very interesting and he had a hook for an arm
i guess that is pretty cool
yeah it is, but the bad guys never prevail in the end
