Did you see the last Transformers?
No I thought it looked bad.
I think getting away from the main cast was a bad decision.
So Shia is probably best suited for that movie?
Yeah audiences are endearing to him
I can follow that logic to be honest with you
I just think they kind of went to him and Bay should have used him again,
What about Megan Fox?
Well shes been out for a bit.
She could have reprised a role.
I think people grew sour of her antics.
Yeah but you can put up with that with some people
Maybe bonafide stars
Well who would you consider that to be?
Maybe Julia Roberts
Oh please no one has seen her do a movie in years.
Well you can put up with female angst so long as they are producing
I dont think thats true
Just look at Hollywood actresses act like divas all the time
And dont get away with it that much
