He man!
How's it going?
Not too bad. You?
The same.
What you doing this weekend?Riding on the wake of Amazon's Oscar gold, I'd assume.
Think I'm gonna make it a Netflix weekend.
Watching anythin in particular?
Nah, just gonna surf around.
I hear you.
Netflix has been making a lot of originals lately.
Riding on the wake of Amazon's Oscar gold, I'd assume.
What do you mean.
That movie that Casey Aflec won for.
Huh?
Manchester by the Sea.
Oh, yeah. Was that an Amazon flick
Sure was.
That's so strange.
I agree.
What ever will the big studios do?!
