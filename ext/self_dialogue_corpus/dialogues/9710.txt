Have you heard Kendrick Lamar's new album?
It's crazy good, Kendrick always delivers!
Yeah, it's a little bit behind his last album overall for me, but it's still better than 99% of everything else out there.
"DNA" is such a jam, and I like the video too.
Don Cheadle is in the video, right?
So is Schoolboy Q.
I'll go with "Humble" as my favorite song on the new record.
My favorite part is the chorus, it sounds like he's saying "Biyombo" instead of "Be humble"!
It would be an even more amazing track if it was actually about Bismack Biyombo.
He should do that for the next album.
