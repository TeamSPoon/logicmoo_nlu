Did you ever get to the Beatles live?
No,they stopped touring before I was old enough.
Yea,me too.
Would have loved to see them live!
I know,a lot of screaming though!
Oh god,the girls screaming throughout.
That's why they stopped touring.
Oh I didn't know that.
Yea,they couldn't hear themselves singing.
Wow,it had to be incredible.
