Did you catch the game last night?
Yeah, it was crazy. I can't believe they pulled back from that score!
At first I thought it was over for the Eagles.
Yeah but then Carson Wentz started playing really well.
I don't know about that. I thought the offensive line just held well.
But without the passes from Wentz, they would have never scored a touchdown.
I guess that's fair, but I don't think Wentz has been playing too well recently.
He won them the last game didn't he?
Yeah but that was one good game out of the last couple. Recently he's been playing poorly.
I think he has been playing alight. I mean the Eagles are winning aren't they?
Yeah I guess a win is a win. So I won't complain.
I'm definitely not complaining about the winning after last season.
Definitely. Last season was rough.
I cant believe that we went 7-9-0.
To think that in the early 2000s the Eagles were making it to conference championships and now we have a negative record.
Yeah it's a rough time to be an Eagles fan.
Well at least we aren't doing too bad this season. What is our record right now?
The Eagles are 4-3-0 right now.
Hey that's actually pretty good.
I'll take it. At least we have a winning record.
