Are you into any classical music?
Actually I'm a huge fan of a lot of movie soundtracks like John Williams or Howard Shore.
I love both of those composers.
Who do you like?
2 Steps from Hell comes to mind, I really like their music because its so epic.
I know one of their songs, Creation of the Sun.
Oh yes, that's one of my favorite songs by them.
I also like listening to theme songs from movies.
What kind of theme songs?
Well I like the Anakin and Padme love theme from Attack of the Clones.
I'm a huge Star Wars fan, I can't say I have a particular favorite though.
I also like the Imperial March.
Oh yeah, that's a good one. Who doesn't like that epic theme?
I also like the Jurassic Park soundtracks, they hold a lot of memories for me.
That reminds me of an artist I like who is similar to these styles, Enya.
I love Enya, I know her from the Lord of the Rings movies.
Now those are some movies I love.
I love the fact that I can listen to movie soundtracks have such vivid visuals because I can associate the scenes to them.
I agree, it makes the songs that much more meaningful.
I'm looking forward to the next Star Wars movie, I will be preordering the Last Jedi soundtrack as well.
