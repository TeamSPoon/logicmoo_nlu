Do you think that Bears have the worst font office in the NFL?
Oh absolutely. Just take a look at their last draft and how they are getting ridiculed for it.
On ESPN they said that the Bears were "fleeced" by San Francisco GM John Lynch.
Lynch came out looking like a hero after his draft day trade with the Bears.
He sure did. Rumor has it that he got whomhe wanted anyways at the end of the first day.
Meanwhile the Bears pay up for Trubisky who probably won't even play for a couple years.
I know! The bears have so many holes at several positions.
Tons of holes and little experience across the board.
The draft is supposed to be used to build a roster up, not to gamble on a high risk quarterback.
I wouldn't call Trubisky high risk, but the bears don't have the right system to support his development.
Well, drafting a division II tight end in the second round didn't help either.
That's my point exactly. The Bears front office has no idea how to build a roster.
Well if these high risk drafts don't pan out, then I would expect Gates to be fired as Bears GM after this season.
I agree. I think he set the Bears organization backwards at least three years with this disaster of a draft.
I would have preferred they traded down and stockpiled draft picks.
Me too, you build a team through defense and bodies on both lines.
Tell that to the Bears!
I wish I could. I think they are killing this team.
Well at least one good thing will come from this terrible season the Bears will have.
Oh don't you dare say that a Bears front office gets another high draft pick! Haha.
