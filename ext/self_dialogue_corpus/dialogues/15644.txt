Have you heard the new Jon Pardi song?
No, I haven't even heard of Jon Pardi.  Who on earth is that?
Oh my gosh, seriously?  He's a country singer!
That must be why.  I don't really listen to country.
Oh strange, I thought you did.  Well you should check him out.
But I don't like country.
He's not really overly country.  There's a bit of rock twisted in too.
What does he sing?
Well a lot of songs.  The newest one is called Dirt on my Boots and it's got a great tune to it.
I might have heard that.  It sounds familiar.
You probably have, it's really popular right now.
What else?
He's got another great one called Up All Night.  It really gets stuck in your head.
I swear I've heard that before.
So maybe you have heard of him after all.
Yeah, I've probably flipped past a station where they were playing him or something.
Probably so.  I can play some of his music for you if you'd like.
Yes, that would be great!  Turn it on!
I sure will.  You're sure to like it.
Okay, thanks!
