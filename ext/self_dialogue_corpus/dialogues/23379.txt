I just watched the entire Jurassic Park series - what a great series.
You think?  The first is obviously a classic, but the others?
Well, Jurassic Park II gets a lot of criticism for nothing... now the third...
I don't know about Jurassic Park II.... but III was just god awful!
Well we agree there.  Jurassic Park II had some fun dinosaur scenes though, cmon!
Yes, but it tried to do a whole King Kong movie in the last 20 minutes!
I guess that's true.  Nothing holds a candle to the original, obviously!
Nothing in the series at least... did you see Jurassic World?
Of course, at least three times in theaters!
What'd you think about it then?
Well I totally loved it.  It brings back the roots of the series!
You didn't think it was a little too goofy?  Chris Pratt, who turned from TV goofball to suddenly "Hollywood Hottie"
Oh cmon, Chris Pratt is great in it!
He's not the worst thing about it.  How about the whole plot!  Genetically modified dinosaurs...
Well if you're watching any Jurassic Park, some level of suspension of belief has to be taken.
I guess that's true.  But Jurassic World is just a CGI fest.
I'm not sure you're being fair... besides the original it's the best of the series.  It tries to the bring the roots of the series back.
I guess you could say that... it tries!
We'll have to agree to disagree.  But seriously you should check out the Michael Crichton book, I just finished it.  It's way better than the movies, even the original.
OK, I'll have to check it out.  Thanks for the recommendation.
