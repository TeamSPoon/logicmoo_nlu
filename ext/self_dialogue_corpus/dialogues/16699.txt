Do you like music?
I love music, I listen to satellite radio on TV all the time
I have xm in my car
Right now I'm listening to y2k hits
I love the older songs.
Me too, the older music is much better than the new stuff
It is, like Rhianna, you never hear her anymorw, she's a great singer.
I also like how as tank, you never hear them anymore
What song are they known for?
The reason
Oh yea, I remember them, they are really good.
Hero by Enrique Iglesias is such a great song
I like that song
I'm listening to it right now, and forgot how beautiful it is.
It's totally a great wedding song
It's perfect for weddings.
I also love I'll be the greatest fan of your life for a wedding song
Me too that's what I always wanted my wedding song to be.
I wanted that one, but changed my mind
What one did you use.
