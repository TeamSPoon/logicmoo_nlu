Have you seen the new Star Wars movie?
I haven't yet is it still in theaters?
No, not anymore but you can get it on Xfinity.
Ok great. I heard there are new characters!
Yes! My favorite is the female lead Rey.
I can't wait to see it I wonder if it will be better than the Old Republic.
I thought so!
I'm going to need to refresh myself and watch them all before the Force Awakens.
Yes I want to figure out if Rey is related to Luke Skywalker.
We will have to wait and find out!
