What do you think about the current state of rap music?
It's very popular, but it all seems like it's the same kind of songs.
It doesn't seem like the average listener should relate to the content, most of them rap about making lots of money and driving fancy cars.
Yeah, rappers like Tupac, and even others like Dr. Dre really rapped about stuff that told the listener what they experienced.
Yeah, a golden era in rap for sure. There were a lot of songs about butts, though.
Nothing wrong with that! Rump Shaker was always a classic.
Yup. Sometimes I'd wish some of these current guys would sing about it without being so degrading and nasty.
It sells, though. Current rap always seems to hit it big on the charts.
I wonder if there's any good underground hip hop artists looking for a break.
There's plenty! You just have to know where to look.
