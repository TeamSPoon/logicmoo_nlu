Guess what movie I just watched last night?
No idea, lay it on me.
The original Fast and the Furious was on TV.
Wow, I have not seen that movie since it was in the theaters.
Yea, it was out when we were in high school.
I can not believe it has been so long.
I really enjoyed it when I first watched it.
Of course, we were all into cars and the modding culture.
That movie really did a lot for tuners.
Yea, it somewhat started the whole import craze here.
