Have you seen Into The Wild?
Yes. I loved it.
It is definitely eye opening.
It gave me a new perspective on life.
Sean Penn directed and did an amazing job.
Really? I didn't know he directed.
He can do it all.
Yep, he's amazing.
I would like to take a trip like the one in the movie.
Me too. I am seriously thinking about it.
Alaska would be amazing to see and do it the way Supertramp did.
I would go there but it's dangerous the way he did it.
I know. He died horribly in the movie.
I could not do what he did.
It would be awesome. Giving away everything for an adventure.
I think he was a bit crazy.
Possibly, but society is crazy too.
I think I'll keep my stuff and just do a vacation.
You must not want to live to the fullest like in the movie.
I guess not.
