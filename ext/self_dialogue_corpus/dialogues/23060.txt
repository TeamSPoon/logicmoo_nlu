What is a good drama movie?
I am not too into movies that are completely drama.
What about movies that are part drama part comedy?
I can get into that. Do you have any suggestions?
I would check out the movie Seven Psychopaths.
What is that?
Have you ever seen the movie In Bruges?
No I have not.
Oh, well that was made by the same guy.
Cool. So what is Seven Psychopaths about?
It is about a guy who is making a movie, and it tells the story of seven different crazy people.
That sounds interesting. Is anyone I know in it?
Yes. Colin Farrell and Christopher Walken.
I love both of them! They are such great actors!
They are. You will love them in this movie.
So when did this come out?
It came out back in 2012.
I can't believe I have never heard of this.
Me too. You will love it though.
Thanks for introducing me to it. I will watch it tonight.
