What ever happened to Rick Mirer?
The old Seattle Seahawks quarterback?
The very one.
He started on opening day for a couple of years in the 1990s but after that I don't know.
What is he doing after the NFL?
I have no idea. I know he played in college for Notre Dame.
He apparently owns a winery now in California.
What a good life! To play in the NFL and to own a winery.
He also has a charity.
What is the name of his charity?
It's called the Mirer Family Foundation.
He also played for the Jets in the NFL.
I only remember him for the Seahawks.
He played for the Jets too.
What year did he play for the Jets?
He played for the Jets in 1999, under head coach Bill Parcells.
How did the team do that year?
The New York Jets? They finished 8â€“8.
That's not too to bad.
No, nor is it too to good.
