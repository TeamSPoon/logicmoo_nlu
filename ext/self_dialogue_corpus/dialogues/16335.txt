Where do you work?
I work at a home improvement retail store.
Do they have music playing throughout work?
Of course! We'd go crazy otherwise.
Whose playlist is it?
The company has its own approved playlist.
Approved?
Yeah, they censor some lyrics. They also have very few recent songs to avoid copyright.
They're cheap, it sounds like.
Somewhat.
So what kind of music do they play?
A big mix of 80s and 90's pop-rock, and some mainstream country-pop.
Not any full-on country?
Oh, of course not. I'd quit and get another job.
Me too, that's dreadful.
They have some recent music though
Like what?
Sign of the Times plays once a day and that's this year.
How would you describe it, generally?
It's throwback for people my age: mostly focusing on 90s pop and the 80s we heard our siblings play.
