Who will win these series' over the weekend (FRI-SUN) HOU/NYY, BOS/TB, TOR/SEA ?
Just the games this weekend? Houston just beat the Yankees so...
Just Fri-SUN. I have a friendly wager with my brother, just wanted to see what people think.
Short series is really a crapshoot. Let me look at the probables at least.
Just your best guesses works. Don't need to go sabermetric on it lol.
Well I'll go with the Yankees because they play well at home at least.
Yeah, and no Keuchel for Hou.
Boston seems easy, they're just better and also at home.
I'm detecting a theme here lol.
Well like i said, short series you scrape whatever advantage for a guess and they fit the bill.
Right, that's pretty much my thinking.
So you took NYY and Boston...I'll go with the Mariners for the other one.
I went with Toronto.
That one could probably go either way, home field aside.
Stroman on the hill Saturday and the homefield, I figure that's at least a chance.
I can't get a read on either of those teams so I'd just flip a coin lol.
Pretty much. I'll stick with the home theme too.
Did you not pick the Orioles series? You did all the other AL East teams.
Nah, we're both Orioles fans, of course we think we're gonna win.
Haha. You can hope. Bundy's throwing, so that's good.
