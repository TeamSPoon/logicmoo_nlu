What is it you like about Disney movies? Is there anything specific you can think of?
Disney films always have fun storylines, and always leave you feeling great at the end.
That's true. I can't think of a single Disney movie with a sad ending. Can you?
I will say that Big Red was sad, honestly. I watched that as a child and will never forget how I cried.
I hadn't thought of that movie. That one's an oldie.
Yes, but when a movie brings you to tears, especially as a child, you tend to remember it.
That's true. Bambi did that to me. His poor mother...well, we know what happened to her.
Yes, now we are on the same page. But in general, Disney movies are fantastic and a brand I trust.
Well thank you for your honest response. I appreciate it.
You are most welcome. Disney's Pixar movies are my favorites though. I love the 3D animations the most!
