Hi there, Baby. You listening to music?

I'm sorry. I didn't quite catch that. I think Raffi is rotting your brain. You should try something else.

That's right, he is Canadian, but I won't hold that against him.

Alrighty. What else can you tell me about Raffi?

He's never advertised to kids? That's actually very interesting. It certainly hasn't hurt his sales. I appreciate that. I was forced to watch a ton of ads when I was a kid, mostly about the joys of smoking. Did you know my parents used to buy me candy cigarettes?

Sorry, sorry. Got off the point there. Ok, big question; Raffi or The Wiggles?
