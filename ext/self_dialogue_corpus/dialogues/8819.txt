Have you ever listened to The Grateful Dead?
I haven't but my mom was a fan so I know a few songs when they're played.
I can show you some of their music if you want--my favorite album is American Beauty.
Is that the one with the rose on the cover?
Yeah, that one and Workingman's Dead are great albums. Absolute classics.
What songs do you recommend?
Ripple from American Beauty is wonderful.
Wasn't there just a new documentary about them put out?
Yeah, it's on Amazon Video.
We should watch it sometime.
