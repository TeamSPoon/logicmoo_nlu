What year did Toy Story come out?
Man, I don't know.  The 90's.
Just looked it up.  1995.
That's amazing.  Hard to believe that movie is so old.
The animation difference is pretty amazing between then and now.
Well, technology has come a long way.
That was back when Pixar was basically unknown.
And it put them on the map.
And inspired a franchise!
Truth be told, I don't really care for those movies too much.
