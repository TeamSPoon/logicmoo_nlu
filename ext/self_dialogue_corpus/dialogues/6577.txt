I wonder if disney will ever acknowledge a LGBT relationship.
I'm willing to bet.
Really?
Oh yes, I think there has been a gay couple shown in a show recently.
I think Star vs. the Forces of Evil.
Yes, and I think there was a petition for Elsa from Frozen to be LGBT.
Wow, that would be awesome.
Definitely.
Or she can remain single, that would be fine too.
That would definitely be fine.
