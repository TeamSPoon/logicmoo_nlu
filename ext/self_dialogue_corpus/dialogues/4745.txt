The best hotdog ever.
Always.
By the end of the day, the one at the bottom of the pile have been simmering all day
Yep. That's what make them so good
Yellow mustard, please
Same here. I need some onions.
Here.
This is where it's at. A day at a ball park. Watching the game. Hanging with your friends, family, loved one. hated ones. Hey if you love baseball, even though I hate you, I will sit and eat a hotdog with you, y'know what I mean?
Haha. You're an idiot. I wouldn't want to share this with someone I hate. Let's say ISIS, would you eat a hotdog with an ISIS member?
Um They're Muslims. They don't eat pork.
Right, bad example... Ok,. That parking maid handing out tickets. Would you eat this hotdog with her?
I most certainly would. Hell I'll even buy one for her.
You say that now, but we'll see what you say once you see the ticket amount.
Let's get some peanuts and get back, they're starting.
Here we go, the bottom of the 7th. We got this game in the bag
We're behind by 3 points
I know, but these guys don't start playing until the bottom of the 7th. Just you watch.
Hope you're right, I got money riding on this.
How much?
I got 100 on a vegas line. I get 150 if we win. Here we go. I'm so excited.
