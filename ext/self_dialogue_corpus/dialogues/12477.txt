Who is your favorite female character out of all of the Star Wars movies?
I kind of have a soft spot for Leia, she is just a classic.
She does have all of the iconic costumes and her tough girl attitude.
She has so many good one liners too during the movie.  Carrie Fisher was great in the role.
I do love the original cast, but I also love Gin Erso.  Plus her romance story was great.
The ending of Rogue One was so sad though, but I kind of loved how it led into the beginning of a New Hope.
That's true, I do love that they made a movie that wasn't about the Skywalker family and was about what was happening other places in the galaxy.
I loved all of the movies, but Rogue One was definitely something different.
I agree. Plus Diego Luna was pretty good looking too. I loved his character.
I'm so sad that both of them died in the end.
