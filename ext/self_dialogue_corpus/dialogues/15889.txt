Speaking of QestLove, I know him.
You talking about the drummer from The Roots?
Yes. His name is Amir Thompson. He got started with Boyz To Men.
What you mean?
He played drums for Boyz To Men on their song Motown Philly.
I didn't know that.
After that thing blew up, they kicked Amir to the curb.
That's messed up.
No it ain't. QestLove hooked up with some guys HE wnt to high school with and they formed The Roots.
The Roots still touring overseas and stuff.
I know. Now Boyz To Men doing insurance commercials and stuff.
That's funny my dude. But I do like a lot of their songs though.
Oh, I ain't never said their music wasn't the bomb. I play end of the road after every session.
You stupid. I like It's So Hard To Say Goodbye.
Because that's that song from Cooley High. That movie AND that song are classics.
You got me wanting to hear something live right now.
You might as well go ahead and play that Motown Philly. Do you have the extended version?
You better know it. I'm going to put that thing on right now.
Turn it up loud. I like it loud.
You mean like Jewel T and DJ Dollar Bill, I like It Loud? Remember that joint?
