What artists have you been listening to lately?
I have been hearing a lot of Britney Spears.
Oh really?
I have not heard her in a very long time.
Yeah I like her music.
I like her song work.
Oh yeah you read my mind, that is exactly what I am hearing now.
That is funny.
Have you seen her live?

Me neither.
We should go together.
But I thought she only plays in vegas.
Oh yeah well maybe we will see if she comes out here.
Sounds like a plan. Anyways what other musicians do you like?
