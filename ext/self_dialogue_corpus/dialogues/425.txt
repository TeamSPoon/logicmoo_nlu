So, how do you think the Green Bay Packers will do this year?
They did lose Eddie Lacey, but I think the rookie will fill in his shoes nicely,  I like them to get back to the Super Bowl.
You sound very confident about that. What makes you think so?
I think Aaron Rodgers will want to put another ring on his finger before he calls is quits.
Aaron Rodgers still has a lot of years left. Why do you think this is his year?
I like the additions they've made to the offense, especially Martellus Bennett from the Patriots
Yeah, they really need a playmaker at that position, I'm with you on that one.
I also really like the rookie running back they picked up in the draft
We need to have to have a good running back to make the passing game work.
Yes!  We have so many good receivers and if we can have any success in the running game, watch out!
What else?
I also think Aaron Rodgers is so good.  He gets frustrated not being in the big game.  He really should have been there more than once.
I know.  I felt bad for him the year he played injured for the whole playoffs only to be let down
I remember it like yesterday!  Up by 15 points with less than five minutes to play in the 4th quarter.  How do you lose that game?
Everything that could have gone wrong did.  A botched onside kick, a blown coverage 50 yards downfield.  It makes me sick!
Me too!  Forget I brought it up.  This year we will make up for it and get back to the Super Bowl.
I am with you.  Do you have tickets to any of the games this year?
I can buy some from my friend who has season tickest, but they're expensive this year.  over $100 a seat I think.
I will pitch in and we should go to at least one game this year!
Sounds great.  I will talk to my friend and see what games I can get!  Talk to you later!
