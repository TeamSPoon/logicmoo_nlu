Who's the best duo: Outkast or UGK?
I'd have to say UGK. They have that southern, raw, down home sound that is relateable on many levels.
Really? I'd say Outkast.
Why Outkast? They aren't even rapping together anymore.
UGK isn't rapping together either. But I like how down Outkast is for Atlanta, but they don't let their "donwness" stop them from getting their coins.
Are you saying that UGK is too down?
Bun B talked about it in The Story. He considered doing a Big Pimpin 2.
But they didn't make it.
That's because didn't want to seem like he sold out to his original fan base.
Well, UGK is still better than Outkast.
