Silence of the Lambs is one of my favorite older thriller movies. Have you ever seen it , Robert?
Yes, it is one of my favorites too! Jody Foster and Anthony Hopkins are in that one.
I am a huge Anthony Hopkins fan!
Oh yeah, he rocks.
What is your favorite part of the movie?
My favorite part would be when Anthony, or Hannibal as he plays him, escapes.
It is terrible how he portrays the eating of human brains by Hannibal.
Hannibal ate anything he wanted!
Yesm it is hard to sit through some of it.
Gives me nightmares if  I watch it too late at night!
