Have you seen Suicide Squad yet?
I have and I loved it! Who's your favorite character?
Harley Quinn. She's something else. Joker was ok too.
I really didn't like Jared Leto as The Joker. I miss Heath Ledger.
Oh trust me we all do. But Will Smith was the comic relief in my opinion.
Yes he makes any movie great.
Which character's powers would you like to have?
I'd love to have the Witch's powers but I'd like to be able to control them myself.
Good choice. I would like to have the Diablo's powers to manipulate fire.
That is a pretty cool power but kind of dangerous no?
