Oh favorite classic rock group?
By a mile Queen.
I love Queen.  Freddy had the most incredible voice.
The Highlander soundtrack was the best soundtrack I've ever heard.
Yeah it was awesome.  At least by one person.
Yeah, they were the movie soundtrack of the 80's.
He did Flash Gordon too.
Yes, but it wasn't as good as Highlander.
Such an under rated song and movie.
I agree.  But I'd be remiss if we didn't point out all his great music.
Totally.  I loved Another One Bites the Dust.
And Crazy Little Thing Called Love.
As a kid I though Elvis sang that haha.
Yeah, haha, I did too.
How about We are the Champions?
OK maybe the best victory song of all time.  Survived all these years.
And of course We Will Rock You.
Yep another long surviving song.
They just don't make them like that anymore.
I know, Freddy is missed for sure.
