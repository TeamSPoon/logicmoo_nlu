In the past, you've told me that techno music is the basis for several other genres of music.
Yes, that's correct.
What are some of these genres?
I think rave music has the most interesting story.
How's that?
The Belleville Three, the pioneers of techno, were critical to the development of techno.
Yes, you've told me that.
True, but there's something that people don't understand.
What's that?
The Belleville Three didn't have much commerical success. Their contributions were largely artistic.
Yet, electronic dance music -- EDM -- is huge today!
Yes, that's because of rave music.
How so?
The early records from the Belleville Three ended up in the discount and used bins of many record stores.
Why does that matter?
Well, some of those records were found in Amsterdam and London. And, talented people there recognized their potential.
What did they do them with them?
They modified that sound. They took the Detroit element out of it.
What happened to the music then? How did it change?
It was more robotic, but that allowed it to become more popular. To many people, it represented the sound of the future.
