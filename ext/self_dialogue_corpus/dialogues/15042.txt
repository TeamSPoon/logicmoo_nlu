Will Ferrell is so unfunny.
You're crazy!
Hardly. Name one good movie he's been in.
Zoolander.
But he wasn't the star of that movie. Ben Stiller was.
That's not what you asked though.
OK. Name a movie that he was the unequivocal star.
Talledega Nights.
That movie was awful.
You just don't know good movies.
