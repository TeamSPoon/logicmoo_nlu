Hello, so what of music do you like?
New Wave is my favorite by far.  How about you?
I like all kinds of music but mostly just listen to whatever comes on the radio.
That's cool.  Do you like any New Wave?
Frankly, I'm not sure what that is!
You know - early 80's post-punk like Duran Duran or Men Without Hats?
Oh yea, there's some great music from that time!  Any bands you suggest?
Yes!  I've been a fan for a while and have found some great ones!
Like who?
Well, the Chameleons for one.
What's their sound like?
It's a dark sounds with jangly guitar.  They have an exceptional sound!
Interesting.  Is there an album in particular you suggest?
Yes.  Start with Script of the Bridge!
What makes that album so special?
It's one of a handful of albums where the sum is greater than it's parts...
What do you mean by that?
Every song is good and there is no filler whatsoever.  The album is cohesive and an amazing piece of work!
Any other songs you might suggest?
If you really want to get serious, check out the song "Is It Any Wonder"...
