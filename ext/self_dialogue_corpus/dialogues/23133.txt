My nephews are in town this weekend, and I was thinking of taking them to see a movie.
Smart move! They'll sit still for a few hours that way.
Exactly. Those kids love movies.
How old are they?
One is 8 and the other is 10. Both boys.
So what movie are you going to take them to see?
I'm thinking about that new Cars sequel.
Cars 3?
Yeah, that's the one. They like Pixar movies.
Did you see the first two Cars movies?
No, unlike my nephews, I'm not a fan of animated movies.
Well, just a fair warning - Larry the Cable Guy does the voice for one of the cars.
Yuck, I'm not a fan of his. Who else does voice acting?
I can't remember who else. There's some big name actor voicing the main car.
Now I kind of want to go see the Despicable Me sequel instead of Cars. I can't stand Larry the Cable Guy!
Maybe you should ask your nephews which they prefer.
Yeah, I could do that. But what do I do if they pick Cars 3?
Maybe you could say that the tickets are sold out.
Very tricky! I like how you think.
I have had to deal with kids in the past myself!
