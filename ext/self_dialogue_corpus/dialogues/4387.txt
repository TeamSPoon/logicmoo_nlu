Have you seen the movie Shutter Island?
You mean the one with Leonardo DiCaprio? It was good.
It really was. I never saw the twist coming even though I feel like I should have.
The whole atmosphere of that movie was incredible.
Martin Scorcese is such a wonderful director.
I know he did a really good job on the thriller Cape Fear also.
I saw that about a million times and I've even seen the original.
The one with Gregory Peck right?
That's the one. Although I prefer the updated version with Robert Deniro.
Yes he's one of the best actors of all time, especially when it comes to thrillers.
