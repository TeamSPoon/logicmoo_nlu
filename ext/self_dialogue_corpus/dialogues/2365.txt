Why do they call the American football a pigskin?
That's a good question. It's not actually made of pig skin.
I know, right? They're made of cow leather, aren't they?
Well, the professional NFL ones are, whereas amateurs use footballs made of synthetic materials.
What synthetic materials are used?
Most people use footballs made of vulcanized rubber.
Is that the same material used to make car tires?
Yes, exactly.
So why is the term "pigskin" so popular for the football?
Well, back in the old days before the invention of vulcanized rubber, they used animal bladders to inflate the football. Pig bladders were common for this purpose.
That's kind of gross.
Things have changed a lot thanks to the wonders of modern technology.
Another odd thing about the American football is it's unusual shape.
That's true. No other sport has a ball shaped similar to it.
Why do you think it is shaped that way?
It is believed that this shape was never really designed by anyone specifically, but gradually came to this shape over time.
How is that possible?
The game originally had a round ball, like a soccer ball, but the shape usually ended up lopsided because it was difficult to inflate in those days.
It seems like it is meant to be long and pointy at the end so it will spiral through the air.
That's basically true. In the 1930s, when the forward pass became prevalent, the ball became longer and smaller in diameter.
