Who is your favorite comic actor?
I would have to say Robin Williams.
Oh yeah, he was always hysterical, I first saw him in Good Morning Vietnam.
Every time I tell someone good morning I have a flash of him saying it over the radio.
I can't eat a banana cream pie without think of Mrs. Doubtfire and when he shoved his face in the pie.
I know exactly what you mean. I would have voted for him as President in Man of the Year.
Me too, he always made me feel better on a bad day, even when he had a serious role.
He knew how to make serious not be so serious.
I could have see him playing the joker in a batman movie.
The world lost a lot of laughs when he died.
