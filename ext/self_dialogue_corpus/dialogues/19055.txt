We're looking for music to play during the school assembly. Do you have any suggestions?
What kind of assembly is it?
It's a high school pep rally. So it's got to be civil and also get people excited.
Well, are there any options so far?
We can use anything that's in the school's library. It's pretty extensive though.
Hmm. Well, probably pop or rock would be best, right?
Yeah. I don't think I can get away with classical, and EDM might be too much.
What about, like, Taylor Swift?
That's a good option. Do you have any idea what songs we could pick?
I'm not really all that familiar with pop music.
Hmm. Okay, I'll write it down. What about rock?
Well, maybe go for something on the classic end? Rolling Stones or Aerosmith or something.
Hmm. Either of those could work. I bet Aerosmith would go over well with the kids.
Wait, why don't you just ask the school band?
Like the marching band?
Yeah. Don't they usually play for events like this.
Do they? I had no idea.
You should find out and ask.
I hope they can do it!
I'm sure it'd make things easier.
