What are some of your favorite Celtic Bands?
I was at a street festival in Michigan, and I heard a band called Blackthorn.
What were they like?
They were really good. It was a really authentic sound.
I know, right? There are so many fusion bands today that are trying to combine folk with rock.
I really don't like when bands do that. If I want to listen to an Irish band, I want something authentic sounding.
Do you have some Blackthorn albums?
Yes; I have several of them. They're an older band, so I'm not sure how much longer the guys can keep putting out music.
What albums do you like?
I like Today's the Day for Drinking, Another Round, and Nil 'na La. Its good, authentic Celtic music with good vocals and instrumentation.
I like Blackmore's Night. They're a little more on the fusion side, but they still have an authentic sound to them.
What are your favorite Blackmore's Night songs?
I really like "Old Village Lanterne" and "Renaissance Faire." I like the longing and passion in some of these songs.
Unfortunately, a lot of songs today are lacking in that passion because they seem very cookie-cutter.
That's especially true of the newer things you hear on the radio; it all sounds somewhat pre-programed.
So do you prefer vocal or instrumental Celtic music.
I often like to listen to the stuff with vocals so that I can sing along while I'm driving.
I like to listen to the instrumental stuff and have it playing in the background while I'm working.
Copy that! Celtic music is great because even when you're doing something, it makes you feel like you're somewhere else magical and antique!
Yes, and sometimes that place that you are imagining is far better than the place where you are!
