Can you believe Prodigy died?
Who?
Prodigy, from the hip-hop group Mobb Deep.
I had no idea. He wasn't old was he?
Only 43.
That's shocking. I always enjoyed their music.
Same here. Prodigy was an icon for the gritty NY hip-hop sound of the 90's.
Havoc, Mobb Deep's producer is an exceptional talent as well. He must be so distraught.e
Yeah I tried watching an interview with him after finding out the news, but it was too sad.
They started out young too?
Fresh out of high school. Their first album came out when they were 19.
That's amazing. Prodigy also had some very insightful lyrics, it wasn't all gangster-ism.
Totally. He really cared about the kids growing up in bad situations.
And he never changed. I heard a new song from him just the other week, and he was still Bandanna P.
He had quite a few nicknames, didn't he?
H.N.I.C. has to be the most popular. I've seen people in politics use that acronym about Obama, hah!
Looks like I'm going to be listening to The Infamous album all weekend long.
Prodigy and Havoc always meshed up perfectly with other NY rappers like Nas and Raekwon.
I think that showed Prodigy's ultimate caliber as a rapper.
Truly, one of the greatest to ever pick up a mic. Rest in peace Prodigy.
