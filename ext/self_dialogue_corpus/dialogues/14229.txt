Do you know if Lady Gaga speaks french?
No. Why do you ask?
Because she sings some of the lyrics in french for Bad Romance.
Oh, you're right. It's only a few lines though, so she probably only learned a little bit for that song.
Yeah, you're right.
It's still cool that she sang some of it in french, though.
I know. I love that song.
Me too. Did you ever watch the music video for it?
No. Is it any good?
Oh, it's amazing. I would totally recommend that you watch it.
