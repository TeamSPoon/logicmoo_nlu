Have you ever listened to Of A Revolution?
I don't think so?
You might have heard of them called OAR.
No, I don't think so.
I think you would really like it.  They played them on the radio in my hometown.
Oh really?
Yeah - they are an alternative rock band.  That is sort of your style isn't it?
Yeah for sure.
They have a really different sound.  Someone told me that they thought they sounded a little like Dave Matthews or something.
Oh really?
You should check out the song Crazy Game of Poker.
Is it on Spotify?
Yes!
Sweet - I'll definitely check them out.
I saw them live in Kansas City.  It was a great show.  Super high energy.
Sounds like my kind of show.
I'm telling you.  I think you'd dig it.
I'm going to pull it up on Spotify now.
If you like them, you should check out the show in Austin with me.
I'll let you know.
