What do you think about this young rapper named Matt OX?
I think he's a cool lil' guy.
You listen to many of his songs?
Yeah, but I can't say that i'm that big of a fan. I can see why he's getting popular though.
I can't think of a setting where I'd want to listen to his songs.
I bet his songs bang at parties.
Maybe. I'd probably leave the party if they started playing his music.
Ha, don't hate on him, his song "Overwhelming" is amazing, that's a hit record.
Alright, I agree with that. I think his producer Oogie Mane is amazing.
I see a lot more hit songs coming from this kid.
