What music did your parents listen to?
Lots of different music. They have so many CDs.
What are their favorite bands?
The oldies they like the most are the Beach boys and stuff by Elvis
Really old stuff.
Yeah and they like to dance.
Yeah that sounds right.
What did your parents listen to?
They actually have mostly jazz and classical.
So Kenny G?
Pretty much, and a whole lot of others I don't recognize.
My parents always talk about music of their generation as the best.
Haha that sounds kind of annoying.
Yeah, but I supposed everyone likes their old music for the nostalgic factor.
Are we going to love the music of our times?
The noise on radio right now?
Yeah.
No way. That stuff is garbage.
I bet you'll miss it.
I bet I won't!
