I'm not a fan of all of Tom Cruise's works but I sure did like Top Gun.
I didn't think that I would like it, but I did.
It's got the sweet music, sweet cinematography, sweet story.
And the twist!
I knew that something bad would need to happen to shake up the story but I wasn't expecting the death.
And how much it shook up Maverick - that brought it home to me.
I liked Charlie, too.
Maverick was so hot to prove himself to her but she took her own time, and I liked that.
And managed to break through his thick headedness and teach him a lesson!
Which took a lot!
