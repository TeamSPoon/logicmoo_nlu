I can remember watching the original three Star Wars in the 80's
I do too It was like an event.
The movies really blew my mind because they weren't like anything out there.
Yes, they marketed them so well.
The characters made the movie.
Oh I agree.
I wasn't too happy with the next three they tried to do.
Me either but now I feel hopeful about these newer movies.
I think there are endless possibilities for the stories to weave together.
Yes that's how I felt about Rogue One.
