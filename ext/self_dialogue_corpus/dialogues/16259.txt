I'm so excited for September. I'm going to see Lady Gaga in concert.
You're so lucky. I love her music.
I know! I can't wait to hear her sing The Cure and Million Reasons live.
You have to take video of her singing those live. Oh, and record John Wayne. I love that song.
No problem, we will have to see her perform together another time.
Definitely, I have loved her music since she first came out with her album The Fame.
Me too, I still love Poker Face and Just Dance.
Same here, I listen to them whenever they come on the radio.
I love her as an artist because she is a great singer, but she's also such a talented song writer and performer.
I agree, once I heard someone on a radio show say she is the modern Madonna, but the difference is she writes her own music and plays instruments.
I love that about her.
Me too, I'm not putting down Madonna or her career in music. I'm just saying that what Lady Gaga does is different.
What's your all time favorite Gaga song?
I don't think I could pick just one. I definitely love Paparazzi a ton.
Me too and I get nostalgic for 2008 when that comes on.
I think her new album Joanne is great too.
I think I like Joanne and The Fame the best out of all her albums.
Those two are definitely my favorites.
I also like the collaborations she did with Tony Bennett.
I love Tony Bennett!
