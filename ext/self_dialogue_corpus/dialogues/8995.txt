twenty-one pilots are not rock music
what do you mean? the play them on the rock stations!
yeah, but they're obviously pop or rap or something
you could say the same thing about the beastie boys!
um, no. they definitely have a rock edge!
so does twenty-one pilots
the only thing edgy about that pseudo-band is how edgy they think they are
have you even heard stressed out?
okay, yeah. have yOU? because that's clearly a terrible pop song
with a good message, though!
