I'm so ready for football season.
Me too, I hope the Lions can win a playoff game this year.
Well they still have to go through the Packers in their division.
That is the only tough competition in the division.
Maybe, I think the Vikings will give them a run.
Are you kidding, they lost Peterson.
What? I didn't know that.
Yeah, he signed with the Saints.
The Saints!?! That seems like a strange fit.
I agree, he is more of a pound the ball runner, than a pass catcher like they like.
That is part of the fun I like about the NFL.
I like that too, the changes are fun.
Well most changes. I don't like the teams moving.
It is going to be weird to have two teams in L.A.
And one in Las Vegas.
That is going to take some getting used too, but that happens in a year or two.
Man Carr got paid by the Raiders.
Well he had an awesome year last year.
He did, too bad he got hurt.
It would have been nice to see them give the Patriots a run in the playoffs.
