Who are your favorite comedy movie actors?
I love Adam Sandler! He is great!
I love any of his movies especially when Drew Barrymore is his costar.
Oh me too.  The Wedding Singer was one of my favorites.
Yes that is a great one with some really funny moments.
Fifty First Dates was really funny too.
Yes I really liked that one as well.
Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore really work well together.
They sure do, they have been in a lot of movies together.
They seem to have a great chemistry.
