Are thier any good thiller moviers out now
Over the weekend i watch harry potter
Yeah man she's good
It had on the edge of my seat
Everything exspecally when he lock her in the basement for 6 month with no food
It wasn't funny at all just creepy
It was really scary
And creepily
On Saturday i will see something funny
But this movie was not bad
