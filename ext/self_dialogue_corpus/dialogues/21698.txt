Have you ever seen Schindler's List?
What an amazing movie!
I agree, Liam Neeson really owned that role.
Who was Liam Neeson?
He was Schindler!
No way! I might have to re-watch that now.
Yea totally! What was your favorite part of the movie.
Watching Schindler change and become a savior to a lot of people.
Yea, that was a good plot line.
What was your favorite part?
The girl in the red dress.
Oh that's right, she was the only part of the movie that was in color right?
Yea, that's what made it so impacting.
Remind me, what happened with her again?
Nothing good, the Nazi's got her.
Oh yea, I remember now. That part was so sad.
Sad yes, but necessary.
Why do you say that?
Well, without it, there would be no reason to keep the movie black and white.
Hmm, I never thought of it like that before.
