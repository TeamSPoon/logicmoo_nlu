Do you ever listen to Lynard Skynryd?
If I hear them on the radio.
So you aren't a fan of theirs?
Not really, but I do like to listen to southern rock sometimes.
Do you like Freebird?
I have to be in the mood to listen to that one.
What do you mean?
It's just really long and if you aren't in the right mood, it's just now fun to listen to.
I get what you mean.  Do you listen to CCR?
I listen to them about as much as Lynnard Skynyrd.  My dad used to love CCR.
