Watch the Warriors last night?
Yeah, they didn't play that well, but got the win.
Well, it wasn't that hard with Leonard out for the Spurs, and Parker already gone for the series.
And to add to that for San Antonio, David Lee got hurt during the game.
One more win and Golden State gets a rematch with Cleveland.
Boy, the Cavaliers have been unbelievable.
Yeah, even Kevin Love is playing great and Thompson on the boards.
And, of course there's always Lebron.
Well, the Warriors aren't to shabby either when you add in Kevin Durant.
He had a great game yesterday, and what about McGee--he's becoming a force.
Yeah, but he gets tired easily and I don't think he knows the defensive rotations that well.
But I think he's a lot better than Pachulia.
What about Pachulia and hurting Leonard's ankle--did you think it was a dirty play?
I don't, but everyone else thinks it was.  Look he's a clumsy guy and stumbled in.  I don't think he has the skill to make that play intentionally.
Yeah, he hurt his own player, Durant, by falling into him earlier in the year.
And no one mentions that Leonard was hurt already and then earlier in the game he sprained the ankle by landing on one of his own bench players.
Well, anyway, if things keep going as they are, it will be quite a series between the Cavaliers and the Warriors.
It looks like it--doesn't look as if Boston or San Antonio will win a game.
Well, I'll be rooting for the Warriors.
Me, too; I think they can do it if Klay Thompson gets going.
