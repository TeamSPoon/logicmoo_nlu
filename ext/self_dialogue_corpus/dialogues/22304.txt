I just saw Gardians of the Galaxy 2
Did you like the movie?
Yes, but I did not know Kurt Russell would be in it.  He was a bad guy
How did he look?
At first in the film very young.  I was confused and thought it was makeup.  But now I think it was computerized to some extent
Why do you think that?
Because later in the movie he looked his own age appropriate way in his late 60's and I do not think makeup would have been enough
Was it serious or funny?
The movie had both elements the way many Marvel movies do.  It had some funny parts and some serious plot issues.
Did Stan Lee find a way to get into it?
Yes he did and it was hilarious.
What did he do?
For those of us that are fans, he was seen sitting and talking to characters known as Watchers made famous in the comics as a race that just watch but do not interfere with others.
How was the fox in the move?
He is not a fox, he is a racoon that was enhanced or created in a lab.
How was the makeup on the actors?
It was great.  Some of the makeup for the alien races was truly creative to the extent when I checked the cast I might not have recognized them.
Were there any cameo type roles?
yes, Sylvester Stallone showed up as a captain of a group and although had short screen time is always great to see.
It  is good to see he does things outside of the Rocky and Rambo movies.
