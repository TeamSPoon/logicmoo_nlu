Are you a fan of the Doors?
The Jim Morrison group?
Well yes, that's the one!
Yes!  I love their music.
Me too!  Break On Through to the Other Side is an incredible song.
Yeah, and I always liked People Are Strange.
Yeah, I like that one too.  I like how they have some piano mixed in their music.
Did you know they were formed in 1965 in Los Angeles?
No!  I always thought they were British.
They're not.  Their first album, The Doors, was released in 1967.
Wow, that's a long time ago!  So they've been around over fifty years.
Yep!  They broke up in 1973, but I heard that recently several of them got back together and recorded some stuff.
Who was it?
It was not Jim Morrison, but two of the others.  They called themselves the Doors of the 21st Century.
I don't think I'd like them without Morrison.
Yeah, he kinda made the group for me too.
Yeah.  Well it'd be interesting to hear what they sounded like, though.
Yeah, I might check it out.
Well, in the meantime at least we have their old hits!
They definitely aren't going anywhere.
