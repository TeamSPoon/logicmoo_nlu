Who is your favorite player on the Carolina Panthers?
Cam Newton is a funny and talented guy.
Yeah he is also really kind to his fans.
I was really rooting for them during their perfect season.
I wish they won Superbowl 50.
At least Peyton Manning ended his career with a highlight.
Yeah some players never win a Superbowl he got to win two.
One with the Colts and one with the Broncos.
Did you know he is the only Quarterback to reach the Superbowl with four different coaches?
That is something he should be proud of.
Yeah it's so hard to get to the Superbowl in the first place.
You have to do so much to get there then it all comes down to one game.
It isn't fair in some ways.
Sometimes you wonder if they should do a best-of-3 or best-of-5 series.
That would be cool if you kept every game single elimination except for the Superbowl.
Think of how different some of the previous Superbowls would have been.
The results may have been completely different.
Honestly maybe changing something that works is a bad idea.
Good point Football is already very popular.
I am so excited for next season!
