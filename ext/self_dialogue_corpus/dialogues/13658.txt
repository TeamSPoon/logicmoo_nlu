Hi.
Hey.
Big Star Wars fan?
I don't know about big, but I do like the franchise sure.
Do you have a favorite film?
I enjoyed The Empire Strikes back the most I think.
That is a great one.  A lot of people pick that as the best.
It is a classic.  What about you?
I like The first Star Wars.
A new hope, yes.
