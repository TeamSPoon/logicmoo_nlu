Hey, what's on your mind, mind?
Actually, I was just thinking about the Guardians of the Galaxy soundtrack.
Like, the instrumental music or the 70s music?
Oh, definitely the 70s music.
It's cool how they brought all that music back and made people listen to it again.
Yeah, it was really a hit. But I was actually thinking about the second movie.
The second one? ...Yeah, I guess it had 70s music in it too.
But you had to think about it, right? I wonder why those songs didn't catch on as much as the first mix did.
I think the first mix had more iconic songs, like "Ain't No Mountain High Enough."
And I guess "Cherry Bomb" is a pretty well known song as well.
Yeah, but I could sit here for ages and not name one song from the newest one.
I guess there was the element of surprise for the first one, too. No one knew what to expect.
Ugh, but the music in the first one was just so good. "Hooked on a Feeling!"
Haha, I love the "ooga chakas" at the beginning of that one.
It's so weird, but it's so fun.
"Pina Colada" also has a fun twist at the end.
And I think the fun element is what made it work so well. People just wanted to enjoy the film, and the music was part of that.
It was like nostalgia for something most of us never actually experienced, because we were too young.
Exactly, exactly. Now I kinda wanna listen to that soundtrack again!
I'm down for it. How about "Come and Get Your Love"?
