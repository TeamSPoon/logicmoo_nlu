I can't believe it's been so long since Snow White and the Seven Dwarves came out.
It's astounding, isn't it? It's such a classic Disney movie.
Totally. The dwarves are my favorite part of the movie.
Which one is your favorite?
I like Bashful the most because it's so cute when his cheeks get all red. What about you?
I like Doc because it is so funny when he can't find the right words to say.
I think it's cool how each dwarf had a different personality yet they were all so sweet, even Grumpy.
I know, and they were all heartbroken when they thought that Snow White had died.
I wonder if they ever visited her at the palace after the prince woke her up.
I guess we'll never know. At least she gave them all a kiss on the head goodbye.
