Who is your favorite pop artist?
I don't know, probably Selena Gomez.
I rememeber her from Disney Channel does she sing now?
Yeah she actually just came out with a song with Kygo.
No way! What it is called?
It is called It Ain't Me. I also really like her song Same Old Love.
Oh that's Selena? I think I might have heard of that on the radio.
I also really enjoy Miley Cyrus and her new songs.
I love her new song Malibu.
Crazy how many old Disney stars are dominating pop music!
