Who is your favorite character in all of the star wars movies
Goi Gon Ginn
he was really good but short lived
yes but I think he brought a depth to episode 1
I dont see how anyone could disagree with that
he tried to help everyone
i did like that about him
Liem Neeson did a great job on that character
yes I agree no one else could have done such a bang up job for the character
he is the bomb
