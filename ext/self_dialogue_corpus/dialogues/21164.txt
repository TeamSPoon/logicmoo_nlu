I watched Bulldog Drummond's Bride last night. Ever see it?
With Heather Angel, right?
Yes, that's it!
I never saw that one, but I saw Secret Police awhile ago.
Me too! I love Heather Angel!
I could watch her for hours! She was so cute!
Yes she was. Did you ever see Headline Woman?
Yes, excellent crime story!
I liked it too but I think I prefer her in funnier films.
Me too. They bring out her cuteness!
She was great in Half a Sinner!
Was that the one with the dead body?
Yes, in the back seat!
Yes, I enjoyed that one.
I have a whole DVD of her stuff.
She was in Lifeboat I think.
Yes, Hitchcock. Not her best work, but still enjoyable.
What else do you have of her?
Shadow on the Stairs, Time to Kill, several of the Bulldog Drummond ones, Three Musketeers, Early to Bed and about 20 more!
Wow, you're quite a fan!
