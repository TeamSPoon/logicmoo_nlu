So what are your favorite running songs?
I liked a good mix of rise and fall.
I know what you mean.  Like something fast like AC/DC then something mellow like Train.
Yeah, you can't go all out for every song.
You know what was a great one?  Running man.
Yes awesome song.  What about Sympathy for the Devil.
Yep, has a good mobile beat to it.
Yeah.  Hmmm, what's another good one?
8 mile.
Oh yeah, that's a great motivation song.
Yeah I agree, just makes you keep going.
Oh how about Radioactive from Imagine Dragons.
Yes, great song, makes you run harder.
But I also like some mellow stuff mixed in.
Like Soul Sister from Train.
Or American Pie.
Yeah, perfect.  That one is nice and long too.
Yeah long songs are great for runs.
Especially when you're just trying to zone out.
Yeah, I know what you mean.
