Do you have a favorite Prince song?
Oh definitely mine is The Beautiful Ones
That's off his Purple Rain album isn't it?
Yes it is and in my opinion a very underrated song.
Mariah Carey and Sisqo did a remake of that a few years ago
Yes but it doesn't touch the original. Prince's voice and that synthesizer mixed together are amazing.
Have you seen the Purple Rain movie?
Oh course I have, one of the best movie soundtracks of our time.
Another of my favorites is When Doves Cry. Ginuwine did a remake of that one.
Right and Timbaland's beat was on it so you know it was unique.
That whole Pony Album from Ginuwine was wildly popular back in the day.
Right that was around the time when Missy Elliott, Timbaland, and Aaliyah were all teamed up.
They put out some really great music together.
Aaliyah is one of my all time favorite r&b artists that's for sure.
I saw the tv movie about her life not that long ago.
Yes her and R. Kelly had an unusual relationship. I'd have been mad if I were her parents also.
I loved her song Let Me Know. I think that was off her first album.
It was and so was At Your Best. She redid that one from The Isley Brothers.
The Isley Brothers are the undisputed kings of romantic music.
I liked when R. Kelly and Ron Isley were teaming up on songs back in the day.
