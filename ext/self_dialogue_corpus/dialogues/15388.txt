You got married recently, right?
Yup, back in August in Jamaica.
Did you have any music?
Of course! We had Jesu, Joy of Man's Desiring and Here Comes The Bride.
Seriously? You don't seem like that kind of guy.
Of course not, silly.
So what did they do?
They let us create our own playlist that we walked to and to enjoy while we were eating cake.
What did you use?
It's hard to remember in full because it was on my old phone which has died.
Tell me what you remember.
We used mostly Adele, had some Journey, and of course, Sarah Bareilles.
I heard Adele is super popular in Jamaica.
Oddly, she is! Her and Rihanna.
Why do you think Adele is loved there?
She has a ton of soul, something Jamaica praises.
Why Sarah Bareilles?
"Cassiopeia" and "1,000 times" are really romantic songs, and she sings them well.
I love what I've heard but I think you know more about her than me.
My wife and I love her! We always have a CD of hers in the car.
