How far is one base from the next?
A base is 90 feet away from the next one, 60 feet in little league baseball.
I've seen different baseball parks have different distances to the fences.
True, and that actually adds interesting strategy to the game of baseball.
Yeah, some parks have closer fences, relatively speaking, I've noticed.
True, and those parks favor hitters more, especially home run hitters.
So, the other parks, with the farther fences, favor the pitchers more, it sounds like.
Yes. Teams that play in those "pitchers parks" will structure their team differently than the other teams.
Sounds like baseball is more than just a game of hitting, throwing and running.
Certainly more so. There are many analytics and different strategies that can be and are used.
So a player who hits more home runs will be treated differently by the other team than a player who runs fast.
Indeed, because you have to defend against the player's strengths as much as possible.
So, would it pay to know about the other team and its players?
Most certainly it would, but teams try to hide some information about their strategy to keep their opponents guessing.
Yes, and that's why you'll see coaches perform hand signals that hopefully only their players know.
I've seen catchers give signs with their fingers to the pitcher.
Yes, so the pitcher will know what type of pitch to throw.
Can an opposing player steal signs?
They can, if that player can see them and he has figured out their meaning.
I've seen catchers try to hide their signs for that reason.
