Did ya'll see the Nationals and Pirates game yesterday?
Yeah, it was recording breaking for Frazier!
Yeah, I know! He a had a new career-high four RBIs! DO you know what the final score was?
Right! Pittsburgh beat the Washington 10-4!
Okay thanks! I wasn't able to see the very very end.
Gotcha. Frazier hit a two-run double in the sixth inning and a two-run single in the seventh!
Yeah man, I seen that too and he is MVP right now in my book!
Did you know that Frazier started this season as a utility player?
No, I didn't know that why?
Yeah, one reason is because center fielder Starling Marte is suspended until mid-July for violations.
OH WOW! I did not know about all that. Why was Marte suspended?
I had heard on NFL network that it had to do with some drug violation but I don't know any details.
Oh shoot! That' too bad.
Yep, Frazier is back after missing nearly three weeks with a strained left hamstring, and is on fire now!
You just never know what is going to happen in a season because of injuries and whatnot! Whats Frazier's avg?
He has a AVG of .347, last time I checked.
Oh okay, right on!
Frazier, the leadoff hitter, is 10 for 20 in his last four games, so we will see what the rest of the season has to hold!
Cool, baseball is my favorite pastime! Thanks for the updates!
Mine too! I just wish I had more time to watch it! Cool!
