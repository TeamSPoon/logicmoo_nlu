Did you see the last Mets game?
The one in Arizona?
Yeah, the Wednesday game.
I did. They lost.
They've lost seven games in a row now.
That's pretty bad. Do you think the season is already over for them?
Nah, I think they have time to bounce back.
Maybe. Yoenis Cespedes comes back next week and that should help.
True. I think they have a few other key players out with injuries too.
Yup, Steven Matz and Seth Lugo should be back soon too.
Too many early season injuries, in my opinion. It really cost them.
Yeah and I heard Noah Syndergaard might not be back at all this season.
Has the coach said anything?
No, but a team official said they've deserved to lose these games. They aren't playing well.
It's weird that they're still managing to cling to second in scoring in the Major Leagues.
The games have had really high scores.
Yeah, they lost to the Brewers 11-9 last week.
Still, I have hope the team can turn it around.
Me too. There's a lot of talent on the Mets.
Once the core team is healthy and returns, I think they'll see better results.
