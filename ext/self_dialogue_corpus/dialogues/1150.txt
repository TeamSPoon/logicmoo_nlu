Only a few weeks until NFL training camp. I can't wait.
Will you be attending some days?
Probably not, since it is so hot outside. I'll just catch all the news and observations online.
I might head out to see how the newer players we got perform. I'm really excited about Brandin Cooks.
Oh yea, me too. That dude looks super fast.
I'm hoping it'll be like the Brady to Moss from 2007.
With his other receivers, Brady might take back the touchdown season record from Manning.
That would be really really sweet.
I think he has a good chance with all the weapons he has: Gronk, Edelman, Mitchell, Hogan, Amendola, Allen
Yea, there's just too many. You left out James White!
Our offense is going to be really fun to watch. Do you still have season tickets?
Yea. Let me know which games you want to go to and I'll hook you up.
Are you serious? I'd love to go to the home opener to watch them raise the banner
Consider it done!
Thanks so much. Gillette Stadium will be rocking that night.
How many touchdowns do you think Brady will throw?
I'm going with four.
They're going to destroy the Chiefs. They lost Jamaal Charles too.
Can't believe he's a Bronco
I hate that team.
