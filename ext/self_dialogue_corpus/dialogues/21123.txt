Have you seen Dark Places?
I'm not sure. Who was in it?
Charlize Theron.
I think I might have. Was Chloe Moretz in it too?
Yes she was.
Yes, I think did see it. Charlize joined a group of people to investigate her parents' murders, right?
Yes, that's the one. Did you like it?
Yes it was really good!
I liked it too. I'm a big fan of Charlize, and Chloe is pretty cute too.
I like Charlize too. She was great in Monster too!
Was that the one about the true life of that serial killer?
Yes, Aileen Wornos, the prostitute who became a killer.
Wasn't Christina Ricci in that too?
Yes, and Bruce Dern, another really good actor!
What else was he in?
He was in the new Django.
I didn't see that.
Ever see Mulholland drive?
Yes, with Melanie Griffith! I loved that movie!
Bruce Dern was the chief.
