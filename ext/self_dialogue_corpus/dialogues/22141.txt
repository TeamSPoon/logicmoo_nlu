What kinds of movies do you like?
I mostly like comedies.
I do, too. Have you seen "Mean Girls"? It's one of my favorites.
I love "Mean Girls". It's a great movie.
Rachel McAdams and Lindsay Lohan were really great in it.
They were. And Amanda Seyfried, too. I love her character.
Haha, me too. Her character was so dumb!
Did you ever see the second "Mean Girls" movie?
I did, but I didn't like it.
I didn't either, actually. I liked the first one much better.
I don't like when certain movies make sequels. They're not as good as the first.
Agreed. I liked "Grown Ups" and "Grown Ups 2" though. I thought the second was better.
Yes, it was good, but the first was my favorite.
What kinds of movies do you like?
I like suspense, horror, mystery, comedy, all of that.
What's your favorite horror movie?
A toss up between the "Halloween" movies and "Nightmare on Elm Street" movies.
Oh man, the "Nightmare on Elm Street" movies are terrifying.
Yeah they are. Freddy Krueger is crazy.
I haven't seen many of the "Halloween" movies though. Just the first two. They were okay.
