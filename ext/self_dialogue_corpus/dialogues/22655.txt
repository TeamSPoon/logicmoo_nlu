I want to watch Casino.
Man, that movie is like three hours long.
What that mean?
I can't sit still that long.
I can. I love Robert Dinero.
It's a good flick, and Dinero plays a good part.
Don't forget about Joe Pesci.
Yeah, he was going around whacking everybody.
That's because them dudes were dumb.
What you mean?
They hit the lick for several millions then them dudes go out spending and flashing.
Dinero wasn't having that.
Then Samuel L. Jackson dumb ass.
What he do?
Remember he forgot to get rid of the van?
Yeah that's right. They whacked him early.
Dude was skinny as all get out in that flick.
That thing was like over twenty five years ago.
It's still a classic though.
Yeah, it's just too long.
