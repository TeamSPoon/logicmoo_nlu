Do you like Lady Gaga's recent music?
It's interesting, it sounds almost like country music.
Oh right, you mean in her new song "A Million Reasons". It wasn't my favorite.
Which songs of her's do you prefer?
I like the classics, like "Poker Face".
Yea, those are really good. Reminds me of college.
The dance songs she makes are good for partying!
They get a little annoying after awhile though, don't you think?
Yea, that's a good point. But the music videos were so cool too.
I love all of her costumes!
