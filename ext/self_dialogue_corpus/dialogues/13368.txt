Have you seen the new Star Wars movies?
You mean The Force Awakens and Rogue One?
Yes I thought they were great, did you?
I did but truthfully I saw those before I watched the first six episodes. I had to go back and watch them.
What's your favorite of the original episodes?
I'd have to say A New Hope.
That's mine too. You know, I didn't even know Darth Vader was a cyborg.
Me neither! I just learned that. He's my favorite character though.
My favorite is Princess Leia.
Yes it was a shock to find out she was Darth Vader's daughter.
