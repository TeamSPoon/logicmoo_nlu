How did you like Lebron's reaction to the snub?
I thought it was perfect when he said "This league knows what I bring to the table."
The same people who say they are tired of the same teams in the NBA finals every year will say they loved the NBA from 87-98.
EXACTLY!!!! When the Lakers, pistons, bulls and rockets were the only teams to win championships in that 12 year span
Whats your favorite "player"
Dirk, he is the best on and off the court.
Can you believe LeBron James will become the youngest player in NBA History to reach 50,000 career minutes tonight.
I know- that stat is crazy and what makes it better is how many games he's sat out.
Do you think De'Aaron Fox will be better than John Wall?
I don't know but thats a great comparison by Calipari.
Lavar keeps running his mouth to know end and last I checked he never won a NCAA Title, NBA title or was a NBA All Star.
Right...100% Great athletes surround themselves around other great athletes
King James passes Shaq for third in field goals made in the playoffs!
It won't be long till he's #1 in all playoff categories.
James stat line....first ever with  240+ points, 50+ rebounds, 50+ assists in first 7 games of Playoff year.
He is simple the best, I know there will always be comparisons to Jordon, but come on.
Did you watch any of the Cavs vs. Raptors series?
No way! That was a waste of everyones time.
Do you think Knick fans are to full of themselves?
Knicks fans are the Jets fans of the NBA
