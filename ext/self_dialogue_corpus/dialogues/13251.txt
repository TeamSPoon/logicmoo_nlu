Are you going to see the new Star Wars movie?
Probably. Last year, I saw The Force Awakens, and it was pretty good.
Yeah, I liked that one too. A lot better than those three around the time with Jar Jar Binks.
I didn't like those either. That character was too annoying.
I think The Force Awakens felt more like the original three.
Yeah, me too. And J.J. Abrams directed it, so that's probably part of the reason it was good.
Yeah, he's great. I liked seeing Luke, Hans Solo and Princess Leia in the movie too.
Me too. That added a lot, for me.
I probably will keep seeing the new ones if they are as good as that one was.
I probably will, too.
