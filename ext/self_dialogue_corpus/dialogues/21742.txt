Have you ever seen the movie Let It Be?
By the Beatles?
Yes,the Beatles.
No I haven't.
It came out in 1970 after they released the album Let It Be.
Oh that's cool.
Yea I saw it in the drive in.
It was in the driveins?
Yes it was.
That had to be pretty cool.
It was awesome to see on the big screen.
I bet it was.
They had a mini concert on the rooftop where they recorded.
No kidding. It was in England?
Yes it was.
I love the album.
Me too. They played Get Back,Don't Let Me Down and I've Got A Feeling on the roof.
That had to be cool.
Cool movie to see.
I think I'm going to rent it.
