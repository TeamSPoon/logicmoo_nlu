We have to talk about Bellflower.
Oh my goodness. You either loved it or hated it.
Loved it. Five starts.
Dark. Surreal. Bizarre romance
Evan Glodell’s going to be huge.
Were there too many explosions, though?
Too many explosions? How dare you.
Yeah, that's a weird juxtaposition of words, I know.
Woodrow’s and Milly’s relation, that was total kismit.
They were lovable losers for sure. And Jessie Wiseman, she's going to have a career, too.
It was so over the top that it was actually great. They took romance to a new level.
Romance? They took bromance to another level.
Yeah, the relationship between Glodell and Tyler Dawson  . . . let's just say Glodell was all in on this project.
Dawson stole the movie, I thought, with his performance. He's the ultimate buddy. Weill you be my Tyler Dawson?
I don't think anyone can be your Tyler Dawson, but I'll be your movie buddy. Jessie Wisemen, though. I've never seen a break up portrayed as the Apocalypse.  It was crazy, hysterical.
Jessie Wiseman was a wrecking ball. She did flat-out warn Glodell, though, even before they started their trip that she would end up hurting him.
Who breaks up with a guy who has a flamethrower?
That was some of the most artful rage I've ever seen.
Glodell is from a new generation of filmmakers. I've heard a lot of new guys called "daring." Glodell is the real-deal daring.
This is what happens when you give kids an iPhone and tell 'em they can make movies.
