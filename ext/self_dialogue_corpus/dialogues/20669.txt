Have you watched any good superhero movies lately?
No I haven't, have you?
Yes I watched Unbreakable again for the third time.
Yes, I've seen that one but it's been years.
Who was your favorite actor in it?
I would have to say Samuel Jackson.
I think I enjoyed Bruce Willis the best.
He was really good too, it's a toss up.
It was a really suspenseful movie.
I would have to agree. It kept me on the edge of my seat.
It also starred Robin Wright.
She is one of my favorite actresses.
She didn't do a whole lot after Forest Gump.
I don't think she did, but I always like to watch the movie when a see that she is in it.
Ubreakable was directed by M. Night Shyamalan.
Everything he directs has a lot of intrigue in it.
I am also on the lookout when I see movies directed by him. I always like to watch them.
Me too. He is a very interesting director to say the least.
I think I'm going to dig up some more Superhero movies.
Me too, I'm kind of in the mood to watch Thor.
