I've never seen this album before.
It's called "Love Songs", it came out in 1977.
Can you get this on CD?
No, it's never been released on CD?
I bet it's worth a lot of money.
Not really, I only paid ten dollars for that copy about seven years ago. Maybe in twenty or thirty years it will be worth a lot.
Are the records in good condition or do they skip a lot?
They're in good condition, and I really don't play that album a lot. I already have all those songs on my MP3 player.
Do you mind if we listen to it now?
No, we have time.
