Hey how are you today?
I am great how have things been?
I've been into watching some new movies lately.
Really what kind have you been seeing?
I saw that new Wonder Woman movie yesterday?
Really, where did you see it?
At the local AMC theater near my house.
Did you like it?
Yes, it was really good.
Do you like woman action heroes?
Yes, I am into the whole woman empowerment movement.
I heard there were screenings that only woman were allowed into.
Yes, that's true bit not around here.
Have you seen anything else lately?
Yes, I saw the Baywatch movie the other day.
How was it?
I thought it was kind of silly.
Oh, why so?
It was kind of a cheap knockoff of the old series, should have known.
Yes, well, that happens with these kind of movies.
