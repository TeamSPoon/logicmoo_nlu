I like songs with dances. I wish more songs in rap and hip-hop had dances to go with them.
You mean like the macarena??
Yes! Just like that, but in rap
Remember that song by Fat Joe and Remy Ma called "Lean Back'? That had a fun little dance.
Yeah even my mom was doing that dance that year!
My mom is cooler than your mom. My mom was doing the Superman from Soulja Boy's song "Crank That"
That song was a lot of fun! What ever happened to Soulja Boy?
I guess he was a one hit wonder, because that was the first and last I'd ever heard of him
Actually had another song I liked although I don't remember the name. They lyrics went "Jumped out of bed, turned my swag on"
Oh yea! The name of the song was actually simply "Turn my Swag on"
