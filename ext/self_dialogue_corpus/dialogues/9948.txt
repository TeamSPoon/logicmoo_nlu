I love the Jason Bourne franchise.
Yeah, me too.
Matt Damon really turned the spy genre upside down with that one.
How so?
He created a spy that had human flaws and wasn't perfect.
I can see how that is true.
The first one in the series is my favorite.
Mine too.
We really get to know Matt Damon's character for the first time.
I agree and the action sequences were remarkable.
