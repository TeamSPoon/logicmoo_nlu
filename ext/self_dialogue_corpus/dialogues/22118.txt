I still haven't seen the last Hobbit movie, should I?
Depends, did you like the first two?
Yeah but not as much Lord of the Rings.
You are not alone in that sentiment.
There was just a sort of magic lost using so much CGI.
Agreed, but I still think they're good films overall.
True but you can't help but compare the two series.
Definitely not, especially since they're both done by Peter Jackson.
Maybe I'll watch it, can't lose much by doing so.
Yeah it's just such a committment to sit down for three hours.
That's why I haven't gotten around to it yet.
Yeah I remember you falling asleep in theaters during the second one.
Yeah but I was just super tired that day, the movie didn't help.
I felt the urge to nod off but Smaug was too cool to sleep on.
I'm so bummed out I missed the Smaug scene.
You missed great stuff, you haven't gone back to watch it again?
Nope because if I fell asleep once maybe I'll do it again.
Guess that's true, the movie as a whole doesn't get any better.
But I feel out of respect for Tolkien I should give them another shot.
If you do I'll gladly come over for a viewing party.
