Hey have you seen the movie Passengers?
No, what's that about?
It's a movie about two people stuck on a spaceship.
Oh, is that the movie with Chris Pratt in it?
Yes, that's the one.
Oh, cool, I really like Chris Pratt.
It also stars Jennifer Lawerence
Oh, who is that?
You don't know who Jennifer Lawerence is?
No, was she in the movie Die Hard?
No, she was in X-Men.
Oh, now I know who she is.
Yeah, she was also in a movie with Bradley Cooper.
Yeah, I like her.
Anyway, Passenger is a really good movie, you should go see it.
It doesn't sound very interesting.
Well, there's a twist to the story.
What's the twist?
Do you really want me to tell you?
Yes, tell me.
