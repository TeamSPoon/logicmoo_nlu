So Taylor Swift put all her music back on Spotify.
I heard. Her fans went crazy.
I know right?
I was looking at it yesterday -- she also has karaoke versions of all her songs
Is that normal?
I hadn't seen it before -- maybe it's just something that really big pop stars do.
Perhaps.
Not gonna lie. I definitely added all her albums to my collection.
Have you been listening to them?
Maybe.
When do you think her new album will be out?
I saw an article on Buzzfeed yesterday that thinks it might be out in October.
I don't think I trust that.
Yeah me either. But I definitely think it will be this year.
That's what Ed Sheeran said!
You think they ever thought about dating?
I don't know. Probably. But they seem pretty different.
She basically made him into the star that he is.
It helps to have friend in high places.
Definitely.
