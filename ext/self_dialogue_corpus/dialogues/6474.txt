To this day, Fantasia remains one of my favorite Disney movies.
The music in the film is simply fantastic.
What is your favorite song?
It is hard to pick. My favorite song would have to be The Sorcerer's Apprentice Waltz.
I think I remember that song. Was it the scene where Mickey Mouse puts the sorcerer's hat on and tries to clean?
Yes. He gets the broom to carry the buckets to the water.
I do remember that one. My favorite song is Night on Bald Mountain.
I do not remember that song.
The scene is dark and scary, but the music has hints of Russian inspiration.
Cool. I will have to rewatch the movie and listen for the song.
