Do you prefer the original superman movies or the henry cavil ones?
For me the newer Superman films were a little disapointing.
Really why? I liked cavil as superman.
I think Cavil was great as Clark Kent.. just something in the script itself. Lacking somehow.
Wow I am surprised I feel almost the opposite, like the original movies were lacking.
In terms of storyline?
Yes I found the newer ones more intriuging and realistic.
I suppose the christopher reeve versions are a little dated and cheesy. But isn't that what a comic is?
Maybe back in the day, but now they seem much darker than originals.
Both have a place in my heart. Reeves will always be in the front of my mind as the original superman.
