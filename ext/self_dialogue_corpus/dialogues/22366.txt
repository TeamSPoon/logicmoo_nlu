Do you want to go to the movies tommorow
I would love to
What movie Do you want to see
The new Baywatch movie looks fun
It does but I'm not really a fan of baywatch
That's too bad
Why don't we go see the nice guys
I heard that movie is hillarious
Hey Do you know who stared in the Spiderman movies
The actor was Toby mcguire
He is a good actor
I just don't like his depiction in the third movie
My ultimate favorite in the marvel genre is xmen
Yes rogue is so awesome in that movie
I heard thet Jack black was horrible in king kong
He's more of a comedic actor
Seeing him in king Kong was frightening
Yeah he acted horribly
What's your take on Mary poppins
A spoon full of sugar. That movie was so cute
