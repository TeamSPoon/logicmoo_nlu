Did you ever go to an NFL gsme?
Yup.
Where?
Orchard Park.  Bills stadium.
What was that like?
Not as good as you might think.
Well, I was only about 12 yers old, and I was a Colts fan at the time.
Colts fan? So you went to Bills stadium as a Colts fan?
You got it!  My Dad took me to the game.
Why were you a Colts fan?  Didn't you live in Bills country?
I sure did, but I was just a child.  I picked the Colts as my team because I liked the horseshoe emblem.
That was it?
That was it.  I knew nothing about the Colts or the Bills.
What happened at the game?
Upstate New York in winter.  My Dad and I sat in freezing rain for three hours, watching two teams I knew nothing about, wearing a Colts poncho, while sitting in a sea of Bills ponchos.
Who won?
I don't remember. I just know who lost.
Who?
My father. You see, he endured the rain, and the sleet, and the jeering fans, and the nosebleed seats, and the high prices, and the frustrating parking, and the miserable game, only to hear his 12-year-old boy--15-minutes intot he game-- say, "Dad, when can we leave?"
Did your Dad ever speak to you again?
