Hey User 2 have you been watching the NBA playoffs?
No. I've only heard a couple of things here and there. What are the standings?
Currently on the west coast Golden State are ahead of the Spurs 3 to zero game wise.
What about on the east coast?
The Celtics and the Cavaliers are playing but the Cavaliers are ahead in 2 to 0.
Looks like it's going to be Golden State VS The Cavaliers in the finals then.
That is what I'm thinking too but I'd like it if the Celtics made it to the finals instead of the Cavaliers.
I'd like to see the Spurs make it personally.
Yeah I'm kind of sick of seeing the same old teams make it to the finals.
Yes, I agree it gets pretty stale if you look at it like that. It makes you wonder what other teams are missing.
Honestly? I think it comes down to work ethic and competitive spirit. I just think the bottom teams are lazy.
Really? I think it comes down to having start players and proper coaching staff.
I can see why you'd think that but it just limits teams that don't have those things. I feelt if you work hard enough you can beat top talent.
I don't agree, I mean sure you can put in a large amount of effort and get better but to beat the real professionals takes more.
That's what I mean. If you work hard enough in time you will become a start talent yourself and beat others.
That's true I honestly didn't think about it like that but you are correct.
That's why I feel the bottom teams are just lazy, they don't want to win they just want to play.
I'm not sure if I was a player I'd just be fine with playing. I'd want to win too.
Say that when your playing professional basket ball for millions of dollars a year.
That's true. I guess even if I lost the games I'd still win in the bank department.
