Have you seen the new Pirates of The Caribbean movie that just came out?
The one called Dead Man Tell No Tales?
Yeah that's the one. Have you seen it?
I have actually and it was really good. Will Turner comes back and Jack Sparrow is around of course.
Yeah and I saw the character Barbosa is in it as well.
Yeah. I really like that character. He is hilarious.
Geoffrey Rush was a great choice to play him.
I liked that Will Turner is back.
Yeah although are you bummed Kiera Knightly isn't playing her character?
A little but it is still a good movie.
