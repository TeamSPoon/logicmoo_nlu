What pop song have you been loving and would recommend?
Noah Cyrus Feat. Labrinth 'Make Me Cry' .
I thought that it was miley the first time I heard it.
Well they are sisters bound to sound a little alike.
I am actually surprised how much I enjoy her songs.
She doesn't have the same fame as miley but I would argue as talented.
Agreed , from what I have heard thus far.
Ya we may have an ashley simpson. Until I hear her live not 100% sure on her talent.
Hahaha, I forgot about that SNL performance disaster.
Ya It destroyed her having a career.
