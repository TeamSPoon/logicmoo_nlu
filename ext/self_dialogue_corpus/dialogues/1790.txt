Wow! Those runners, though!
Yeah, look at that pacing!
Hey look, it's Aaron Rodgers!
Gasps! It really is!
Wave to him!
Hey, Rodgers? What's good?
(Rogers waves back) Wow, he said hi to me!
Nice job!
Thanks, appreciate it!
Now what?
We should probably get some food!
Yes, I'm starving!
What do you wanna get?
Maybe a cheeseburger, a hot dog, some fries and a soda! All sound good?
Yeah, I'll get some nachos, a soda, and corn dogs!
Yeah, that sounds good, too!
Alright, let's chow down!
Hmmm, that's good!
Yup, it is!
Wish we can do things like this all the time!
