What's your favorite kind of comedy movie?
I love screwball comedies!
What in the world is that?
It's something they called movies from the thirties and forties that had to do with really funny situations at a fast pace.
Oh, I think I understand.
Let me give you an example.
Ok, what movie is a good example.
A movie called The Awful Truth is a great one.
Who comes out in that?
It stars Cary Grant and Irene Dunne as a divorcing couple and all the funny situations they find themselves in. You'd love it!
