Do you like horror movies?
No, not really, what about you?
Only if they're not that gory...more psychological type thrillers
Yeah, although I don't mind some of the old 80s slasher flicks
I remember watching one of the Halloween movies when I was young
How did that go over for you
I was scared for weeks after watching the movie
Michael Meyers?
Yeah, he was definitely a scary looking dude
I thought the Freddy Krueger ones were kind of campy
Yeah, those were almost a parody of horror movies
And then there was the Friday the 13th series
yeah another series that was a bit campy
The first one was good, but they rapidly deteriorated after that
Today's horror movies seem pretty gory
Some, but not all. There was a really good one called Get Out that came out recently
Oh yeah, I heard about that one
Yes, definitely a mind bending...not super gory
Not like Saw
No, nothing like that one.
