Has the NFL ever had any competition?
What do you mean by competition?
I mean have there been rival leagues.
Yes, there has been.
What league?
The American Football League existed in the 1960s.
What happened to it?
It merged with the NFL in 1969.
Were there others?
Yes, there were at least three others.
What were those leagues called?
Interestingly, they had the same name.
You mean there have been four rivals to the NFL called the "American Football League"?
Yes, but they all rivaled the NFL at different times.
When?
These rival leagues started in 1926, 1936, 1940, and 1960, respectfully.
Wow, it seems like there has always been a rival league!
Yes, and there will probably always be a rival league. It keeps the NFL on its toes.
Give me another example.
Vince McMahon started the XFL in 2001. It lasted only one season.
