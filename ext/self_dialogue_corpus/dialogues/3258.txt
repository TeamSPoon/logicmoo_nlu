Did you watch The Ring 2?
Yea, unfortunately. It was very bad.
Oh, why do you say that?
Because, it was basically the same movie as the first one, except now, we already know what happens.
Oh yea, I see your point.
Yea, the only twist they put on it, was now it deals with college kids.
I liked how the threat became global.
Yea I guess that was pretty interesting. But what does that even mean really?
I don't know, I guess we'll find out in the ring 3!
Haha, no thanks, I'll skip the next one
