Are you excited for the next Star Wars movie?
I really am! I loved The Force Awakens.
It was so sad, though, when Han dies.
Yeah, but I understand needing to raise the emotional stakes.
I don't know what they're going to do about Carrie Fisher's death.
I think she'd already filmed some scenes for this movie.
I wonder if they're going to have her die in this film to write her out?
I guess we'll have to see.
Do you think Luke will train Rey to be a Jedi?
I bet he will.
I wonder who Rey's parents were.
I wonder if we're even going to find out in this movie. I hope so.
Did you think The Force Awakens was as good as the original movies?
I thought it was better than the prequels.
Well, that's not hard.
It wasn't quite as good as the original trilogy, but I still really enjoyed it.
What did you think of the new characters?
They're fun. I hope they get more character development as we go.
So when is the next movie out?
Christmas of this year! I can't wait.
