What is your favorite gangster movie?
Goodfellas, definitely.
I love that movie!
I know, Pesci and Deniro are amazing in it.
You think Goodfellas was better than Casino?
Yeah.  Why is that even a question?
I'm just saying, Casino was pretty awesome.
That's true.  I did like how they made it as authentic as they did.
What about Scarface?
It was okay.  I'm more of an Italian gangster movie fan though.
Yeah, but you have to admit that DePalma made a classic with that one.
Yeah, I'll admit that.  Still, I think my second favorite gangster movie is Donnie Brasco.
Yes!  I loved Depp and Pacino in that.
Al Pacino... I hope he never dies.
Haha, yeah, I know what you mean.  I'll lock myself inside and watch every movie he's ever made, when he does.
Starting with?
The Godfather trilogy, obviously.
Haha, yeah.  Which is favorite?
Godfather, part two.  Yours?
Same.
