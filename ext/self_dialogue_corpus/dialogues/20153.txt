Have you ever seen the movie Kidulthood?
No I have never heard of it. What's it about
It's a British film about high school kids in London. And How things are today for the Youths growing up.
Who's in it?
It stars Noel Clarke, Adam Deacon and a bunch of other U.K. actors. It's a must see movie
Noel Clarke did he used to be on Dr. Who?
Yeah he did, he wrote and Directed this Movie.
That's cool man.
there is also too movies that came out after this one their called Adulthood, and Brotherhood. It's all one big story with a bunch of the same actors in each movie
They must really be good if they came out with a trilogy set.
Like I said It's a MUST SEE film.
does Noel Clarke  Have any other movies he wrote?
Yeah he does their is one called 4.3.2.1
what's it about?
It's about a bunch of different people that don't know each other, but all of their lives about to intersect.
Is it as good as the other ones you told me about?
Definitely all of his movies are great, by my favorite is the kidulthood trilogy I told you about.
I can't believe I never heard about any of these movies.
I guess maybe because British movies don't get the same promotion as American movies
that's probably true. Im going to see if I can find these movies today.
