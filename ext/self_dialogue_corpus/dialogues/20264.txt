So have you seen any good movies lately in the theaters?
No, I usually don't go out to the theater.
Have you seen any movies other than in the theater then?
Yeah I've been going through old Scorsese movies lately
are those the ones with Leonardo DiCaprio in all of them?
Not all of them but yeah he like to cast him a lot.
I was Wolf of Wall Street and that's it
I bet you've seen others but don't know it, like Goodfellas
Oh I didn't know that was directed by him, that's interesting.
Yeah, I've also been watching Kubrick movies.
Oh which ones?
I watch 2001 last night, it was pretty good but I prefer the book.
That movie is just too confusing for me.
You should try the book, it makes a lot more sense than the movie and it makes the movie more enjoyable.
I'll give that a try.
But my favorite of his is Full metal Jacket.
That movie was also confusing to me when I watched it
It was also based off of a book but it loosely follows it and might be be much help to you.
I'll give these movies a rewatch soon
I bet you'll enjoy them.
