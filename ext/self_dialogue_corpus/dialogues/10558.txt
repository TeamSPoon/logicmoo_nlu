Hi how are you doing?
I am doing great and you?
I am doing fine.
Have you seen any good movies lately?
Yes I have. I watched LaLa land and it was so good.
I have heard about that movie. What is it about.
It is the typical musical but it has a great plot
Really what is the plot?
Well it is a musical love story
That is a vague description
Well it is also about people pursuing their dreams in hollywood and the ups and downs of it
So it is basically like rock of ages but set in Hollywood with acting?
Yes the girl is the only one wanting to be a actress.
What about the guy?
He is wanting to be a songwriter/singer.
Ok what else happens?
They get together to break up later.
That is sad
It is but the ending it nice, It shows her coming to see him and she suceeded and so did he.
That is great to hear.
