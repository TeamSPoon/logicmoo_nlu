Hi
Hello.
What's up?
Nothing, you?
Not much.  You into basketball?
Yeah I like it okay.
Do you have a favorite team?
I guess I like the Knicks.
Ouch.
Why do you say that?
They're awful.
Well they are that.
Have you seen a game live?
No I never have but I want to.  You?
I've seen a few Wizards games.
Did you have fun?
Oh man it was great.
Cool, I should really try to see one.
You should.  Good talking to you.
Good talking to you too.
