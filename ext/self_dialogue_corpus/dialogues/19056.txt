How do you usually find out about new music or new artists?
Normally by word of mouth, or maybe friends as well.
I find a bunch of music I like on TV shows and movies.
That is a great way to find new music as well.
There are so many songs I know, but do not know who sings them or the name of the song.
That happens to me too, I find something on a show and really like the songs.
Do you like watching music videos?
I have not watched music videos in so long, but I know Youtube is a good source.
Remember when MTV was literally just music videos?
Yes! That was before it became nothing but tv shows.
I used to watch it all the time. It is amazing how much music videos have changed with technology.
I still prefer to just listen and picture the music story in my head.
Yes, sometimes the music videos ruin it for me.
Me too, some of the music stories make no sense when you hear the song.
I will forever be a fan of music, I would go nuts without it.
As would I, It is a huge part of my everyday life.
How much time do you spend daily listening to music?
I would say about 4 hours of my day is spent listening to music, not all at once though.
Same here, I do not remember going a day without listening to it.
I have to or I will be in a bad mood.
