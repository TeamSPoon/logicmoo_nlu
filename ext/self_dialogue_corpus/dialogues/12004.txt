What do you think of the connection between rae and kylo?
I am convinced they are brother and sister.
I was wondering that as well. But the actors don't look anything alike.
Driver and Ridley both have dark features. Also not mandatory to look alike.
I suppose that is true, luke and leia were twins and looked entirely different.
Exactly. I am excited to see what will be revealed next, Like what is going on with luke now?
It seems like he is somewhat like the original movies obi wan kenobi, hermit like in style.
That is a similarity there between luke now and obi wan. I love both those characters.
Me too. so iconic and classic. I am so happy they brought mark hamill back.
Ya me too. I was so sad when ford's han solo was killed off.
