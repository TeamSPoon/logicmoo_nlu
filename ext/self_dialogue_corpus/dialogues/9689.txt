Have you seen that new Tupac biopic?
Nah, I don't really have much interest in seeing that.
Really? Why not?
I was never a huge Tupac fan. I think he's quite overrated.
Well of course he's a bit overrated. That's to be expected.
What do you mean?
His life has gotten turned into a myth. If he were still alive people would view him much differently.
Yeah, that's very true. And I think the same goes for Biggie.
Yep. They're both very good, but not the greatest of all time.
Well, if I had to choose between the two I would take Biggie every time.
