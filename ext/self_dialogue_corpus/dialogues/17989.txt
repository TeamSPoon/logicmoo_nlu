You remember that band Clutch?
Yeah they were super heavy and loud.
They used to be almost exclusively loud, but they found a nice balance on the last few albums.
Oh cool, so they've evolved.
Listen to an album called Blast Tyrant, they have a lot of variety now.
Anything I've heard from that album?
"The Regulator" was used in a scene in Sons of Anarchy.
Oh you pointed that out to me when we were watching it, that's an awesome song.
It's probably their most popular, for sure.
I'm 100% buying the album just for that song.
Worth every penny, and the rest of the album is just as good.
Any recommendations?
La Curandera is a good representation of the direction of the band these days.
Okay that one is on my list.
But their album Pure Rock Fury holds up well.
I still listen to that album as well.
That energy helps me get stuff done, it's perfect for the gym.
Yeah I get such an adrenaline rush listening to them.
Their singer's voice is out of this world.
It really is like another instrument!
