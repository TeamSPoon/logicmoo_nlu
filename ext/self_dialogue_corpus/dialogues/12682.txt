Did you see Rogue One?
Yeah, I caught that a few weeks ago!  Got it from the local library.
Cool, what did you think?
Well, I thought it wasn't too bad... had a lot of good action scenes.
Yeah, I thought so to, but I do think they could have developed the characters a bit more.
Yeah, that one girl, for instance uh.. shoot.. Jin?
Jyn, her name was Jyn Erso.  She was played by Felicity Jones
Yeah, I wish they had delved more into her background and given her a bit more personality.
Yeah, I agree with that.  But you gotta admit, the Darth Vader was pretty awesome!
It was, although you do wonder why he didn't use any of those "slam people into walls/ceiling" tactics in the other films.
