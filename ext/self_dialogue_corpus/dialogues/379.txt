Do you think they'll ever reintroduce Robin?
I hope so.
It seemed like they were going to in the Dark Knight series.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah, don't you remember the cop in Dark Knight Rises?
Godon-Levitt?
Yeah, I really thought they'd make him Robin.
Well, we'll never know.
Maybe Matt Damon.
That would be hillarious!
