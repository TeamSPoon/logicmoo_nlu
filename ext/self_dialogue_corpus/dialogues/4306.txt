What do you consider a thriller?
Any mystery.
What about Sherlock?
Which Sherlock?  The ones with Robert Downey, Jr., yes. The ones with Basil Rathobone, no.
What about Death on the Nile?
No, too slow moving.  But I think that most Hitchcock movies are thrillers.
Except Pyscho.  That's a horror movie.
The Birds is a horror movie too.
And the Trouble with Harry is a dark comedy.
But, I think Supspiscion is a great thriller.
