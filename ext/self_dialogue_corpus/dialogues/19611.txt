Hey mom, are you using the surround sound for your shows?
Not today, why?
I just wanted to listen to a new album I bought today.
You don't want to just listen in your room?
I really wanted to enjoy the bass, it's the new Kendrick Lamar album.
I see, yeah go for it!
Thanks mom, did you want to listen with me?
I don't know if I can get into the rap genre.
It's rap but he has some producers that have a more jazzy style.
I can't imagine it's the type of jazz I like.
Thundercat is one of the producers, he is a new age jazz and hip hop artist.
I guess if you put it on I can see, I want to know how they can blend them to sound remotely nice.
There is a reason it is so popular mom.
I guess you are right, I have heard a lot about Kendrick on the news and what not.
What is the album called?
It's actually not his newest album, but it is called To Pimp a Butterfly.
Interesting name.
Yeah, I just never got around to hearing the album when it was newly released, so it is new to me now.
Sounds good, I'll take a listen.
I think you and I will love it!
