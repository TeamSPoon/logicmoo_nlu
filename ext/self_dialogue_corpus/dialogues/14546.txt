Hi.
Hi.
How are you.
Good, you?
Good.  Do you like watching basketball?
Yeah I do.
Did you play basketball at all?
I did a little bit.
Me too, I played up until high school.
I didn't make it that far.
How far?
I played JV a little bit.
Were you any good?
No, that's the reason I never made varsity.
Oh I see.
Were you?
I was okay, but was in a tiny high school.
Oh I see.
Yeah.
ok, bye.
