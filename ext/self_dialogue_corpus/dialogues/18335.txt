Do you have any interest in going to an OAR concert with me?
Who is OAR?
It's a band from Maryland. They play a lot of alternative rock songs.
Do I know of any songs they sing?
I'm sure you've probably heard a few of their songs.
Which ones are most popular?
"Peace" and "Shattered" are probably the ones most played on the radio.
I think I've heard "Shattered" before but I'm not sure about "Peace."
Did you like "Shattered"?
Yes, I really did. Do all of their songs sound like that?
More or less. They all have that alternative rock vibe.
I think I would like to go the concert then. I'm always looking to find new bands.
Awesome! This will be a lot of fun!
When is the concert?
It's on the first Saturday of July. I think it's the 2nd.
Perfect. I'm free that day!
It's in Manhattan.
This will be so much fun.
You should play through some of their albums before we get there so you can sing along.
I definitely will. I will go get them on Spotify now.
