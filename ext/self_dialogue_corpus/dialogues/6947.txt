Have you ever watched a Disney movie on a projection screen?
No, why?
I watched Frozen on it
Did it look different?
No not at all , just bigger.
Well I figure its an animation film.
Yeah so it doesnt really make a difference.
I love the singing in that movie.
I think the actors did a great job.
I cant wait to see if they do another one.
