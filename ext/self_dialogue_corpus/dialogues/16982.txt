So are the Velvet Underground really that influential?
Oh, yes, I would definitely say so. Have you heard the Brian Eno quote about them?
No, I don't think so...
Well, he basically said that not all that many people went out and bought the first Velvet Underground album, but everyone that did started a band.
Huh, that's interesting, the idea being that they made a strong impact and inspired people?
Yes, definitely! And what they were doing was definitely very strange and original.
See, I've only heard the first album and it just sounds kind of trashy and noisy to me, with out-of-tune guitars.
Well, yeah, and the Velvet Underground probably were not especially good at playing rock and roll the way, say, The Doors were.
The point was that they were kind of untalented?
Haha, well, not so much that as that their music forced listeners to rethink their idea of what rock music is.
By it being kind of aggressive, weird, and confrontational, you mean?
Exactly! And defying expectations, with long songs, and noisy songs, and dirgey/depressing songs.
Yeah, let's talk about their lyrics for a minute. I mean, you have a song like "Heroin..."
Right, and I think that's where Lou Reed's literary aspirations are at their strongest.
Do you think he was inspired by Beatnik writers like William Burroughs?
Very much so. I see what Reed as doing there is using pop lyrics to tell a true, bleak story of being a drug addict.
And that hadn't really been done yet.
Nope, not by the mainstream. Maybe by some more underground or obscure blues or jazz artists, but not something many people would have heard.
Well, what about the last song on the album, "European Son"?
I always saw that as a poem set to really wild, avant-garde music, which Reed dedicated to his poetry teacher, Delmore Schwartz.
