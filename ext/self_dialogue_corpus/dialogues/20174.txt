I just rewatched the movie Spy with Melissa McCarthy, have you seen it?
Yes I did. I thought it was hysterical.
I laughed my way through it. My husband thought I was going to have a stroke.
I loved the relationship between the two women. They did a great job of casting that.
Indeed they did. Those two women were perfect together, great comic timing.
I could not believe how much she threw herself around. She is very physical in that role.
I know, I am sure some of it is stunt people, but a lot of it had to be her.
Yes. She isn't up to Daniel Craig's moves, but she was brilliant and hysterical.
Oh speaking of Daniel Craig. He is my favorite Bond ever.
I love him too. Which is your favorite movie.
I really enjoyed Skyfall. The backstory was a great addition to the Bond story.
I agree, it really was great. Casino Royal explained a lot about his character too.
Yes, more in the romance department. Skyfall really dipped into his childhood which was very interesting.
I have to admit I cried when M died in his arms. That was so sad.
I cried too. I was sorry to see her go.
The new M and Q are pretty great. I will always Judi Dentch's M best.
Me too. But what a way to wrap up her character.
It was a brilliant script. The actors did a great job giving fans that moment.
I know. I think as much as I love Skyfall that is probably my favorite moment from the movie.
Me too. A very intelligent spin on a Bond woman.
