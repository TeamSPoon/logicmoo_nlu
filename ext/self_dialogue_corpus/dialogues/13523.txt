So who do you think is the worst character of all time in Star Wars?
Man, that's easy it has to be Jar Jar Binks.
I can see where you would think that he is the worst one but I have to disagree I would think that Jabba The Hut is the worst.
What? Man you are crazy Jabba the Hut is one of the best characters in Star Wars,
How do you figure that, he's just a big blob of jello that cannot even speak english.
He's like the Tony Soprano of Star Wars, he cannot even move and people and aliens fear him
Okay I can see where you are coming from and I do agree that Jar Jar is a tool
Exactly he runs around like a chicken with his head cut off and doesn't really contribute except by accident
Maybe I should have asked what your favorite character was instead lol
Oh well there is always next time.
