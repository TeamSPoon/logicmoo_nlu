How do you feel about the series going up to 10 movies?
What are you talking about?
Oh, I'm sorry. The Fast & Furious series.
Oh, that one. I honestly think that's just silly.
I thought the same. To think the tag line for Furious 7 was "One last ride."
Right? At this rate, there's going to be 3 extra last rides.
For number 8, "Just one more ride."
For number 9, "Seriously, this is the last ride."
For number 10, "Someone please stop this last ride."
I haven't laughed this hard in years!
