What do you surmise is the best Beatles album?
Sargeant Peppers
Yeah I would tend to agree with that one.
It just has so many classics on it
The variety of music is present on the album
I actually have it on album too
I think they poured their hearts into it
Yeah they didnt leave anything on the table.
Can you see a band having that kind of an album again?
Maybe but we wouldnt be around to hear it.
