Hey, I love your dress!
Thanks! Guess where I got it?
Where did you get it from, it is so cute!
I got it from the boutique right in town.
Something Else? I love that place!
Yes! They have super cute things in there all the time!
They really do!
I love all their clothes.
I have bought so much stuff from them, i also got a floral shirt, a pair of flip flops, and a skirt.
I go there all the time!
My favorite part about their clothes is that they only get a few of each item in.
Yes, I love that. Then you wont ever see someone with your shirt on!
That is the worst! I hate seeing people with the same shirt or dress on as me!
Ugh! I know, that's why I love shopping there!
Kristin the owner is alway so helpful too! She has such a great sense of style.
She always has the best outfits!
Oh I know! If I owned that shop I would too!
Benefits of being the owner!
Well maybe we can go there together one time! But I gotta run! It was good talking to you! Bye!
Ya that would be nice! See ya!
