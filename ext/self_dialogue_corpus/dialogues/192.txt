So, did you see Batman V Superman Dawn of Justice.
Yes, I did.. and sadly, I thought it was one of the biggest disappointments movie-wise in my life.
Well, it had a LOT of live up to.
Well, even with that, there was just so many missteps here and I can't really begin to count them all.
Let me guess the biggest one....
Yeah, Martha!  Save Martha!  Yeah, I'd totally call my mother by her first name if I thought I was about ready to die.
Yeah, and Batman's all, "Oh, wait you have a mom!  That must mean you're not a danger after all!  I shall join forces with you now!"
I know, I mean, it just doesn't make any sense, and I don't care how many essays people try to concoct to justify that sloppy bit of screenwriting.  They've had Batman vs Superman fights many time in the comics that have done it way better.
I agree.  I did think it was cool see Wonder Woman, though.
Yeah, I heard that movie is really great.
