So,you don't think the Beatles were four lovable lads from Liverpool?
No way were they innocent!
Care to clarify?
They introduced mainstream druguse to the mainstream culture with LSD and MJ use.
So they were taking mind-altering drugs and the mainstream youthculture got influenced by them?
Yes, look at all those young males who wore long hair for about a decade because of the Beatles.
Back to the Beatles drug use,how bad was it?
Put it this way it was so bad John Lennon became a herion junkie.
Definately, Your narrative is so much different than the mainstream media`s.
The truth will set us free, and not mainstream`s narative.
