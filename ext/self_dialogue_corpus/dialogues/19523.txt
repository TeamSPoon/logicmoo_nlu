Have you ever listened to Oh Wonder?
I've heard of them, but I'm not sure it's my type of music. How would you describe it?
It's an alternative pop duo of a man and a woman. Do you like harmonizing?
Usually! That sounds like something I would like.
I think so too! Interestingly, they released their album song by song.
That's strange. When are they releasing their new album?
They have three new songs out now. You should try it out.
What's the name of the band again?
Oh Wonder! You should listen to Heavy or Ultralife. Those are new.
What about the last album?
It's self titled. I liked Lifetimes. It's one of my favorite songs.
Sweet, are there any songs you don't like?
I don't really like Heart Hope.
Oh, why not?
It's a little slow and cheesy for me to be honest.
Man, that's not good. How's the rest of the album?
It's very upbeat and pleasant sounding with some awesome lyrics.
I really do prefer happy music. Thanks, man!
You're welcome. Check them out!
I'm going to listen to them on my way home after this.
