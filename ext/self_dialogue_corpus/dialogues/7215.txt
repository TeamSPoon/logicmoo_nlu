Hey did you watch beauty and the beast?
the live action one or the original animated one?
either one works, ive just seen a lot of talk about it.
oh, well ive watched the animated one but not the new live one
I heard the live one did amazing
Probably re makes always do well when you had a good movie to begin with
that is true, i just prefer watching animated verisons

I dont mind either, i just like anything that is disney
Same here, disney movies are awesome
