Do you like Hitchcock?
Yes, very much.
I just got a huge DVD set.
Awesome! How many movies?
55 plus TV episodes and special appearances.
Any of his silent movies?
Yes. I just watched The Pleasure Garden.
Good movie! How about The Lodger?
It's there but I didn't watch it yet.
You'll like it. It's one of my favorites, as far as silent ones go.
I never really liked silent movies until watching Pleasure Garden.
I bet you'll like The Ring too. Is that in your collectioin?
Yes. Is that silent too?
Yes. It's about boxers who love the same lady.
Is it a love story?
Well, sort of, but it's still Hitchcock.
I know what you mean. It's got a twist or something.
I don't want to spoil it on you. Just watch it.
Is it a thriller too or just romance?
You'll see when you watch it.
