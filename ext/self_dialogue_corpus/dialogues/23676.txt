What do you think about Ben Affleck as Batman in 'Batman v Superman?'
I thought he was phenomenal.  My favorite Batman.
Really?  I think he's good, but my favorite is Michael Keaton.
Keaton was great too.
He was.  It was also the first movie that really set the darker tone for Batman that we have today.
What did you think about 'Batman v Superman' as a whole?
To be honest, besides the Batman scenes, the rest of the movie wasn't really that good.
It was a huge disappointment.  I had looked forward to it for so long.
Yea.  The script was awful and pacing was poor.
They also tried to fit too much into one movie.
Tell me about it.  They had to introduce us to Batman in this film universe, show us Superman, and also introduce the Justice League all at the same time.
There just simply wasn't enough time for all of it.
Not to mention that the actual Batman vs. Superman fight scene was a fraction of the movie's run-time.
Though it was a really cool action sequence.
I will give props to Zack Snyder though for the excellent visuals of the movie.
That's one thing no critic can take away from Snyder.  The man really knows how to make things look good for the camera.
I have high hopes for the new 'Justice League' movie.
Same.  I think 'Batman v Superman' might have been weak, but at least set foundations for a Justice League movie to work.
The good thing is that the cast is great.
Don't forget that 'Justice League' will have Joss Whedon fixing up elements of the script.  And we both know the man knows how to improve a script.
