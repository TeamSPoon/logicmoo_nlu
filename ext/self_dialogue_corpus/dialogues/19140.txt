Do you like the Fleet Foxes?
What kind of music are they?
I think it's what people are calling chamber pop?
What does that mean?
I don't know. It's a lot of big echo singing about the woods and stuff.
Well I think I would like that.
I think you would too. You should listen to a song called Mykonos.
Okay, I will.
They also have a new album out this year.
What is that album called?
Crack-up. I haven't listened yet.
I'll start with the old stuff and work my way forward.
Ryan Adams has a new album too
Is it any good
Not really
I'll always love Gold
Stars go blue is an amazing song
I agree.
I also love Jesus, etc.
That was Wilco not Ryan Adams.
