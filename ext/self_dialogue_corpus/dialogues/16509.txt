Have you heard of Token?
I am not sure. What type of music is that?
He is a teenage rapper.
I might of heard of him before.
He is often compared to Eminem.
Oh yeah, I think I saw one of his videos on Facebook.
He just went on tour with Hopsin.
Oh I like Hopsin, bet that was a good show!
Yes, you must hear this kid, he is a lyricist genius.
What are some of his songs?
He has a new one that just came out called "New Problems".
I have heard a friend talk about that song.
It is really deep and you can feel his pain in the song.
How old is Token?
He is 18. Creates really good rhymes and can rap really fast.
I will have to listen to him. I like Hopsin. Is he like Hopsin?
Yes a little bit. Similar flow to Hopsin, but his own touch to rapping.
What are some other songs?
He has one called "Happiness" and also "Exceptions."
I will look for Tokens' music on Youtube.
