Did you see the last Fast and Furious movie?
No not yet.  Whats that one called again?
Its called The Fate of the Furious.
Do you think that's going to be the last one?
I'm not sure.  I think they said it would be the last one but they seem to just keep churning them out.
It was really sad when Paul Walker died.
It was.  I really liked the ending of Fast and Furious 7 where they did kind of like a little tribute to him.
Oh yeah that was really cool.  I wonder how they did those scenes since he was already dead?
I think they used a lot of CGI but I know his brothers stepped in and filmed some for him.
That's so cool that they can do stuff like that.
