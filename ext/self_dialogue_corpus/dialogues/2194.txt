Hey man, are you excited about the new NFL season? I've had enough of trying to get into soccer, let me tell you...
Yeah, totally! It's the only sport I follow.
I don't blame you, there's way too much to follow otherwise.
What team do you root for?
Well you know I'm a Philly guy, so I'm all about the Eagles!
Yeah, I'm from Seattle so I gotta go for the Seahawks every time.
Woah, I didn't know that!
Yeah, I was in town for when they won the Superbowl in 2013. It was wild!
Yeah, like how?
Oh you know, I was up in the University District so people were practically rioting, but like, in a good way. Tons of great live music and cheering in the streets!
That's awesome, dude. How did you feel about the 2014 season though?
Oh God, don't even talk to me about that one! Superbowl XLIX was a rough one.
Yeah, it was 2005 all over again, you know? Isn't that the last time the Seahawks went to the Superbowl until the 2013 season?
Yup--I don't remember seeing it though, I was a pretty young teenager back then. Pretty sure Seattle wasn't too happy.
Being beat by Denver has to be pretty embarrassing too, right? I mean, you West Coast guys aren't really known for your football...
Hey now, Colorado isn't exactly West Coast! And you always gotta root for the under-dog. I'd do that even if I wasn't a Seahawks man myself...
Fair enough. Who do you think's the best guy on the Seahawks this year? Any favorite picks?
Russell Wilson's always been my man...I don't know too much about any up-and-coming guys this year, though. You?
I think Carson Wentz can beat out Russell Wilson as a quarterback any day, honestly. We don't have to trade around so much when we've got solid talent!
Ha ha, I guess we'll see about that then!
