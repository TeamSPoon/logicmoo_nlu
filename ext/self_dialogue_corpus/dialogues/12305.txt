Did you like Episode I, II, or III?
Absolutely not!
Why not?
They were horrible movies!
What was the worst part about them?
Um. How about Jar-Jar Binks!  That was the WORST character ever!!
Worse then all of the Ewoks?
Well, good point, those were pretty bad too.
So are you sticking to Jar Jar?
Yeah, all things considered, he was pointless.  At least the Ewoks were cute!
