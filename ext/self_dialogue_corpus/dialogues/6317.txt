Who is your favorite Disney princess?
Snow White is my favorite. She is the fairest of them all!
I am not a Snow White fan. Do you just like her, or are you a fan of the movie as well?
The movie is one of my favorites. Why don't you like her?
She's ok but I don't like her singing voice. I do like how she treats the dwarfs though.
That is a shame, I love her singing voice. Let me ask you: who is your favorite Disney princess?
I would have to say Pocahontas, though I know she isn't exactly a princess.
Oh I love Pocahontas!
Yeah she is a really neat character. I like the princesses that aren't so "damsel in distress."
I love the Colors of the Wind!
