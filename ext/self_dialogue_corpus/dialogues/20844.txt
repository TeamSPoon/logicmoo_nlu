Do you remember the movie Can't Buy Me Love?
The original?
Yes the one with Patrick Dempsey.
Yes, that was a fun movie.
Yeah, it is funny because Patrick Dempsey was so geeky and now he is seen as someone so handsome and dreamy.
Yeah, I know. It was a fun high school movie.
I still say one of the lines.
Which one?
What could be more exciting then cards, chips, dips, and dorks?
Ha ha. And what is crazy is that was Seth Green.
Yeah he was really good as the little brother.
And Amanda Peterson was so pretty and great at playing the snotty girl.
It was nice how in the end they all learned to treat each other nicely.
That it doesn't matter who is in the cool group.
Yes, but of course that is not real life.
Yes, we always are judging each other.
I loved the cabriolet in the movie.
Oh yes who didn't want that car, right?
Oh I for sure did.
Yep, in the candy apple red. Ha Ha.
