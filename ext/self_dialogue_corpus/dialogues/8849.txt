I am super glad to have discovered the band White Reaper.
Who is White Reaper, I haven't heard of them.
A garage rock band that is kind of similar to early stuff by The Strokes.
Okay now you have my attention.
Their latest album The World's Best American Band has album of the year potential.
I like when bands have funny titles for their albums.
Same, even better when they can back it up with great tunes.
Is it the album on Spotify?
Yeah, my favorite song is called The Stack, it's so catchy.
I'll listen to it and let you know what I think tonight.
