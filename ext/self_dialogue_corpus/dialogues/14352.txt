Who do you think is going to win the championship this year?
My guess is the Cavaliers.
Are you a fan of the Cavaliers?
Not really, but I like LeBron.
Oh, I'm just not much of a fan of his.
Who do you think is going to win?
I think the Warriors are going to make it this year.
You really think they are that good?
Yes, I really do.
Did you just jump on the bandwagon?
Maybe. I really like the way Curry plays.
Ugh. I think he's nothing but a showoff.
Why do you think that?
Look at the shots he takes.
Yeah, but he makes a lot of them. He's good
If you say so.
He makes a lot better shots than Lebron.
I guess we can't agree on everything.
I guess not.
Can't wait to see who wins!
