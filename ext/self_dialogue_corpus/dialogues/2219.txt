What is the best team name in the NFL?
Titans
I like that name too
It is better than the Oilers
Who are they?
They were the Tennessee team before the Titans.
Titans is a much better name
I agree
Did they do good last year?
They went 9 and 7
That is a decent record
They tied the first place team
Who was in first?
The Texans
They are from Houston right?
Yes
Do you think the Titans will win the Super Bowl next year?
No
I think they can win the division though
Me too, but there are better teams that will defeat them in the postseason.
