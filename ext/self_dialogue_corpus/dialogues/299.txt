Who is winning a fight wonder woman or superman?
I take gal godot over henry cavil anyday.
Really why?
Wonder Woman is essentially a god. Superman has kryptonite as a weakness.
I never thought of it like that.
It is also refreshing to see a female in the power for a change.
I do agree it is nice to have a powerful female superhero.
Henry cavil and christopher reeves back in the day as superman were both great.
Yes no doubts there, but nice to change things up and see a woman of power not just as the love interest.
Yes I enjoy that too. Hope more movies follow suit.
