Did you catch the game against the Minnesota Twins and Colorado Rockies?
I did! How many strike outs did Berrios have again?
I think he had 11 strike outs.
That's incredible. He's been a real shining star for our team lately.
Sure has. Especially after that earlier afternoon games with the twins losing 5-1.
That game was brutal to watch.
Sure was. Thank goodness we pulled through with the night game. Snapped a losing streak for us.
Interleague has been a humiliating part of the season for us. No doubt!
Could you imagine, 3 losses in a row? That would put us in 2nd place. We need to stay strong this season.
Hey, at least we aren't as bad as the 3rd place New York Mets.
Haha! They've been true disasters this year with that pitching scandal and all.
We have great pitchers this year and Berrios has been a shining star for us.
Who do we play next?
The Twins are playing the Royals next...at home.
Oh no! Our home record has been awful this year. We need to just keep playing on the road.
Last I checked Paul Molitor was joking around they will just wear their gray uniforms at home to get in that mindset.
Ha! They should also display the Royals colors all over the stadium.
Ha! Good One. I'm looking forward to the game, it should be a good one.
Luckily it should be a blow out with Kansas losing all 5 games against us this year. We should go to the game.
Great idea. I'll look at tickets.
