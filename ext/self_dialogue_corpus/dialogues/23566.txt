Have you seen Night of The Living Dead?
I haven't but have always wanted to.
You should really check it out.
It's George Romero right?
Yeah the first of Romero's original dead trilogy.
I've seen both Day and Dawn, how does Night compare?
Personally Dawn is my favorite, but Night is a close second, it's a definite classic.
It's black and white correct?
Yes as it's an older movie, there's a remake that was decent as well.
Yeah I've heard about the remake, how does Night compare to newer zombie flicks?
Well Romero is known as long of the zombies for a reason, newer ones often lack the suspense.
Good point while the newer faster moving zombies may be scarier, something about the slow lumbering ones are nice.
I agree it's hard for me go get into zombies that run like track athletes.
Ha! Yeah if you've been dead, don't think you're going to run a 4.4 40 yard dash.
It's been awhile for me and would be willing to watch it again,  would you be game?
Would depend on the day.
Well I could do Friday or Saturday
I work this weekend, but how about next Friday?
That would work for me, see you then.
Sounds great, can't wait!
