Do you watch sports movies?
Occasionally. It's not my favorite but they can be enjoyable. Why do you ask?
What're your top movies?
It's complicated. I loved Moneyball as a baseball fan, but there's one surprising movie that WOULD be my favorite if they had the right ending.
Which is that?
Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story.
YOU liked THAT? You hate Ben Stiller and Vince Vaughan!
I know, I know, but it's set up perfectly.
What did you mean "If the end was right?"
Well, you know how the good guys win in the end?
Yeah, a feel-good ending.
Well, that's not what was supposed to happen.
What was?
Ben Stiller said the original ending, and what's in the end credits, is that the bad guys end up winning as it's more realistic.
That'd be a slap in the face and audiences wouldn't like it.
That's what the studio figures, but I don't buy it. We can handle the bad guys winning.
Yeah, like in the original Rocky.
See? And it won Best Picture!
I agree with Moneyball, especially with Jonah Hill.
Too bad that's the only movie he can act in properly.
