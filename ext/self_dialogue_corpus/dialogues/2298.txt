When does the upcoming NFL Season start?
The first game is on Thursday, September 7.
Who is playing that day?
The Chiefs are going to New England!
Sweet! I can't wait for the season to start.
Me neither. Which team is going to surprise everybody this year?
It's got to be the Chargers! It's there first year in LA and you got to love their team.
I could see them making the playoffs, but you don't see them getting past the Raiders, do you?
They have a chance, you never know what you're going to get with Philip Rivers.
It's possible but Rivers does throw a lot of interceptions!
Yeah, I know. But you got to have faith! Who do you think will make the superbowl this year?
Patriots and Falcons.
You think it's going to be the same two teams? Come on, that never happens!
Yeah I do! The Patriots are always there so you can't bet against them. Do you at least agree on that?
I'll give you the Patriots. But I'm going with the Seahawks.
The Seahawks were my other option, they had a down year last year. I think they'll be back.
If the Seahawks find a way to get Jimmy Graham involved they'll be back!
They haven't utilized him very well since they acquired him.
They haven't. I bet they wish they had their starting center still. That offensive line has been horrible since.
I know, I think that's why they've thrown the ball so much these last few years.
