I love rap music.
Me too!  Although I'm much more partial to old rap music.
That is me as well.  I miss the days of Tupac and the Notorious BIG.
I was listening to Tupac when he was in Digital Underground!
Yeah, I remember them being in some movie in the 80s.
I remember that too.  It had Demi Moore and Chevy Chase in it.
It was called "Nothing but Trouble".
Yeah!  That's it!  Rap music today just isn't as good as it was.
Well now a days they just repeat certain words over and over again and put a beat behind it.  No real talent there.
You are so correct!  Thank God we know what real rap music sounds like!
