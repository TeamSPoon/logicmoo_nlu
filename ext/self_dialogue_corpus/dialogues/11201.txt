Have you heard about the 8 Most Wearable Spring 2017 Fashion Trends?
No. You know I don't let my style be guided by stuff like that.
I know but one can plan their style for the season with those trends.
How?
For instance, the slogan tees.
What about them?
We can be political, feminists or be our own heroes with those tees while looking like we are on trend.
Oh, please. I don't need fashion gurus to tell me I need to wear a t-shirt with a slogan on it to be cool.
I hear you and yes you are right. But with those tees you can spread your message without saying a word at all.
I already do that. Look at the shirt I am wearing now.
Cool slogan "I am the boss of me." Why did you wear that today?
My crazy boss seems to think he owns me just because I work for him.
Wait. You wore that shirt to your job?
Yes, I did. He got the message and I was fired.
Awwh. I'm sorry to hear that but now we can see what is on trend for interview attire.
You never stop do you?
No. Now pink is in this year and it is an empowering color.
I thought they said red was empowering.
Pink is too.
Next thing you know they will be saying lemonade yellow is the empowering color of the year.
