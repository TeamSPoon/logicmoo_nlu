You like Sleeping Beauty?
As in, the princess or the movie?
Both, I guess.
The Princess is okay, the movie is....also okay.
I barely remember the movie, to be honest with you.
That's because not much happens, she's asleep and then she wakes up.
It's one of the less climatic movies of Disney.
Agreed, so much more could've happened.
Well, at least her pink dress looks nice in the movie.
Sure, she had good fashion, I guess.
