What do you think of the Star Wars Franchise as a whole?
Well I enjoyed it but I enjoyed The Force Awakens the most.
Why is that?
Well it introduced us to a whole new set of people.
I take it you liked them quite a bit?
I enjoyed Rey and Kylo's stories the most.
They did do a good job with them.
I enjoyed how there true characters were forced out at the end of the movie when they had to battle.
I think Rey's character will change quite a bit over the next movies.
Yeah it should be interesting.
