Do you like red hot chili peppers?
Yes, they are a good group.
I really liked them in the 90s.
What is your favorite song from that group?
Favorite song was Californication.
I haven't heard that song before, but I'm sure it is good.
You should go to youtube and listen to it.
I will do that later today.
Talking about that group brings back memories.
Yes the good times when we were young.
