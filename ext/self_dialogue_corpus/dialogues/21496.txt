Whatever happened to Charlie Kaufman?
Who? You mean the guy from Taxi?
No, Charlie Kaufman. Dude who did all that stuff, 15 years ago. Adaptation. Being John Malkovich. Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.
Oh, yeah. That thing with Jim Carrey? That was weird, man.
I guess. I mean. It was one of his less weird ones, but. I mean, he was everywhere for a while. He was one of the only screenwriters people talked about the way they talked about directors and actors.
Oh, well. What's the last thing he did?
I don't know. I mean, the last I saw was Synecdoche, New York. If you want strange, that's strange. That was... like, a decade ago. I think he did something with puppets a little while ago. I guess I need to look into that.
Well, there you go. Puppets. Guy does sound pretty weird.
Well. Puppets aren't so strange in themselves -- though it's interesting, when you think about Being John Malkovich. Dude there was a puppeteer.
John Malkovich? Thought he was... like, super serious.
Yeah, no, I mean the main character in that. John Cusack.
Man, speaking of what happened.
Yeah, John Cusack. Guess he got overexposed or something?
Dunno!
Funny thing is, I think he was in a horror film that came out about a year after Adaptation, that pretty exactly followed the plot of Donald Kaufman's script.
Donald? Thought this guy was.... uh.
No, Charlie. Donald is his imaginary twin brother.
Like, for the unions, or?
No, I mean in the movie. He wrote himself into the movie, then he wrote himself a twin brother.
I guess I need to start writing screenplays now.
