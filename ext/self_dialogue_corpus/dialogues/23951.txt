What's a good movie that you just dont get?
Man, I just don't get Titanic?
Why not? It's classic!
Why is it classic?
It's got famous people and they acted very well!
It was too boring for me. Almost 3 hours if I remember correctly
That plenty of time to lay down a great plot
I guess it helps us meet the characters well too
Exactly! they are well cast and have a lot of depth
I still don't like it though
Why is that?
Too much nudity and sex for me
It was just Rose's chest, right?
I didnt care for it and also they slept together in the car
True, I guess that's not for everybody
I watched it with my kids and felt bad afterwards, they were too young
Yeah for a PG13 movie it was a little much
I also didnt like the ending, Rose should let the guy onto the door!
But it had to end that way, make us cry!
Not every good movie needs to make you cry!
