What do you usually wear to NFL games?
I'm not sure I put much thought into it.
Not at all?
Maybe something comfortable?
So just, like, a t-shirt and jeans?
Something like that would be perfect.
I've never gone to one before. I wasn't sure if I was supposed to wear a jersey or something.
I mean, you could if you wanted to.
I don't own one.
Then don't bother. The fun is just in going to a game.
What's it like?
What?
Being at an NFL game.
I think it's really exciting.
So you've been before?
When I lived in Denver, I used to go to Broncos games all the time.
Well, I'll try looking forward to it then.
Loosen up! You'll have fun.
I'm sure I will.
You definitely will!
