Do you like Bruce Springsteen?
Yea I do, I remember seeing him in the seventies before he was such a superstar at the Stone Pony in Asbury Park NJ.
Wow , that must have been amazing.
Yea it was great . Remember his album Greetings From Asbury Park?
Yea I do , it had that old fashion looking postcard on the front.
Yea, great cover.
Yea and some great songs too.
It was his debut album.
Blinded by the Light was on it.
So was Spirit in the night.
He has had an amazing career.
Yea and he is still going strong and I think he is seventy.
Or close to it, he still looks great.
My favorites are Brilliant Disguise and Cadillac Ranch and a lot of others too.
Great songs! He is married to Patti Scalia, she is in the band.
Yes I know that.
Did you ever see him in concert.
No the tickets are out of my price range.
Mine too.
I don't know why they have to charge so much for concert tickets these days. I remember when they were five dollars.
