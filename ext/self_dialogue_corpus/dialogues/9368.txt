What do you think of the rapper "Eminem"?
Personally not such a fan. You?
I wouldn't call myself a super fan, but I do like some of his first hits.
Yea, I'd have to say that even I thought the song "The Real Slim Shady" was pretty catchy.
For sure. I also feel like even though I'm not a huge fan of his, I think he's really talented.
Yea. He probably had to try twice as hard to get respect and recognition in the hip hop community.
Why's that?
Well he is a white rapper in a predominately black ruled genre of music.
Oh yea, this is true. You can really see that play out in his movie "8 Mile".
Yea and that movie was pretty much an autobiography.
