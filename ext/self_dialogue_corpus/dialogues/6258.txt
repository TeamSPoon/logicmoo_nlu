What type of Disney film is your favorite?
Do you mean animated or live action?
Yes, or a combination of both like Mary Poppins.
Oh, yes.  I loved Dick Van Dyke as Bert and his dance with the penguins is a classic!
Or Pete's Dragon.  What a star filled movie.
I loved Mickey Rooney as Lampie, Nora's dad.
I do think Popeye was my favorite though.
Oh, yes.  Robin Williams as Popeye and Shelly Duvall as Olive Oyl was surely one of the best of this genre!
The animated films are truly the stars of Stars of Disney in my eyes though.
I agree - Alice in Wonderland will always be my favorite - book and original film!
