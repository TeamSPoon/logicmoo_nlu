I saw the movie Water.
Simple name.  Never heard about it.
It's an Indian movie, about a young bride whose husband dies.
How young?
She's only eight!
Wow.  What happens to her?
She gets sent away to live in an ashram, as she cannot remarry.
Sounds horrible.
Yes, it's really bad.
What else goes on?
She befriends a prostitute the ashram uses for money.
Yikes.
A rich educated young man falls in love with the prostitute.
Good.
But she commits suicide when she finds her the man's father is her customer.
Tough. What happens to the girl?
She gets used by a man as well.
Ugh.
A woman from the ashram gets her to the rich young man, saving her.
At least there's some hope.
