I just saw Star Wars: The Force Awakens.
Cool!  Any good?
Yes, it was a blast!
Any of the old Star Wars people in it?
Yes - Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, and Mark Hamill!
How did they look?
Debbie and Harrison looked great.  Mark aged.
Too bad.  Everyone survive?
No, they kill off Han Solo.
Bummer!  He was my favorite.
