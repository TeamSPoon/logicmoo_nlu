Did you know that I saw the first Star Wars movie in the theater?
No way, A New Hope? That's crazy.
Yes, I went with my brother.  At the time the special effects were amazing.
The first appearance of Luke Skywalker!
i remember that Harrison Ford became a big action star.
Empire Strikes back was a better movie though.
Well, maybe.  Actually the first three were terrific.
Then the next three were horrible.  Somebody should have written out Jar Jar Binks.
Although the new series is great.  I like the appearance of the original characters.
But too bad about Carrie Fisher, and then wrote Ford out, so that's a bummer.
