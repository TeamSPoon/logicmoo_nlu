You know what's funny? I've never even seen Hercules.
What? You're missing out.
Yeah, I've seen basically every other Disney movie, but I somehow missed that one.
We should totally watch it. Hercules is such a cutie.
Is there a princess in that movie?
Yeah, Meg! She's so sassy.
Oh, is she the one who sings I Won't Say I'm In Love?
Yeah, that's her!
Oh, right. Hercules is the one with the gospel choir.
Yeah that's my favorite part.
