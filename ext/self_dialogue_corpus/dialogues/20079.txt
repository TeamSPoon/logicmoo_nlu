I love comedy movies, how about you?
Me too, but the newer comedies are silly.
What do you prefer?
I am a fan of classic comedies with some of the greats like John Candy.
John Candy? What do you like of his?
Planes, Trains, and Automobiles is a classic.
It is, but would you consider it a comedy?
Maybe not, but there are plenty of other John Candy classics...how about The Great Outdoors?
Not sure if I agree with your taste. My favorite comedies are with Jim Carrey.
Are you a fan of physical humor?
Not exactly. I just like his manic energy.
Maybe you liked Robin Williams, then?
Sure, but his dramatic roles were always the best for me.
Tell me about it. Good Will Hunting is probably one of my favorite movies for most of the actors in it.
Yes, there's that and also Dead Poets Society.
How about your favorite actresses?
I've always been a fan of Penelope Cruz.
What has she done that makes her a good actress?
Well, I like Spanish language films so things like Abre los Ojos were great for her.
Never seen it, but maybe I'll have to check it out.
