Did you like the new Jungle Book?
I loved it, and I really loved Christopher Walken as King Louie.
Seems like he was born to play that part. I thought it was a great movie.
I saw the new Tarzan but I didn't really like it.
It definitely could have used a little more action. I caught myself falling asleep.
I did like the cartoon version, especially since Phil Collins did the score.
Right that was a good version of Tarzan. I loved the Princess and the Frog.
I liked it and I think it was good that they let an African American girl play a princess.
My daughter has the doll, Tiana is her name. She carries a fairy tale book and a little frog.
Oh that's so cute! My daughter has a bunch of Disney princess dolls too.
