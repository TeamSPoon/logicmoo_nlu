How many songs can you name from the 1980's?
Hmm, let's see. Well I was a huge Cyndi Lauper fan, so the first song that comes to mind is "Girls Just Want To Have Fun".
I almost forgot about the crazy costumes and hair do's.
Remember "Boy George" what was the name of the band he was in?
Culture Club, I used to go for walks singing Karma Chameleon.
Let's not forget Michael Jackson was breaking out on his own. He had Beat It and the moon walk. So amazing.
I never did master the moon walk but I did learn the Thriller dance.
That's not something I even want to see, but I could have watched him dance all day long.
He was the best. His song were so good. It's a shame he is not still here.
I would have loved to see what else he would have done with all of that talent.
