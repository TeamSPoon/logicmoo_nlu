Hi, I heard that the new Fast & Furious movie reached 1 billion worldwide box office.
That is a big achievement, although I do not like the movie very much.
Yeah, the domestic box office of the movie is not that great, but it tops in other countries such as China, with more than 300 millions.
With such a high box office, I wish they could really think about how to make the movie fun and entertaining.
There have been so many movies in the series. Maybe they need to think about other storylines.
I agree. I heard that they are thinking about using other characters for the next movie in the franchise.
Dwayne Johnson's character, Hobbs.
That seems to be interesting. I like the actor very much.
They may also put Jason Statham's character Deckard Shaw into the movie as well.
Great. I should wait to see the next Fast & Furious movie.
