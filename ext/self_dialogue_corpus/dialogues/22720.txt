What is the best super hero movie in your opinion?
My favorite would have to be The Dark Knight Rises
That's what everybody says.
Well, its a great movie.
Yeah, but is it the best superhero one, really?
To be fair, I haven't seen all the superhero movies.
But its your favorite out of the ones you've seen?
Yeah, I would say so. You?
I love the xmen movies.
Which is the best to you?
Probably days of future past.
Is that the one where we see Xavier and them as they were teens?
Yeah, young adults.
That was good. I prefer the first couple X men to that one, though.
The whole sereis is amazing.
I think The Origins movie was awful.
Oh yeah, I know that got awful reviews.
Yes, trust me. Don't bother with it.
They made up for it with Logan, though.
I agree.
