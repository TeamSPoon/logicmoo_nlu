What did you think of Gravity?
It was cool to watch in the theater on the big screen.
Yeah, I got it on Blu Ray and it's not really the same.
It's one of those movies that plays better in a huge theater with a good sound system.
Sandra Bullock did excellent though.
Yeah, made me like George Clooney better even though he died in it.
I also liked how it was relatively short.
Yeah, they didn't pad the length unnecessarily which a lot of movies do.
Tell you what, you buy a theater and I'll watch it with you.
Yeah, no problem.  Let me check my bank account.
