Did you get a chance to see Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them?
I did!
What did you think?
I thought it was fun, but maybe not as good as the original movies.
That's pretty much what I thought.
I really liked the special effects.
Yeah, the magical duels looked great.
And all the other magical effects.
I thought the characters were a little thinly drawn, though.
And the plot was a little far-fetched sometimes.
Yeah, but it was still entertaining.
Some of the fight scenes were really funny.
And I thought Jacob was sweet.
What did you think of the ending?
It was cool to see that Grimblewald is back!
I never pictured him being played by Johnny Depp.
Yeah, but I think it works.
Do you think Dumbledore will be in the next movie?
I guess we'll have to wait and see!
I'll definitely go see that one, too.
