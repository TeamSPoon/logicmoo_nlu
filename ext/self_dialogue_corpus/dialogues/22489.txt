Quick question; Have you ever seen Angela's Ashes?
Uh, I don't think I have. Who was in it?
Not anybody I'd think you know, except that Rumpelstiltskin guy from Once.
I know that guy, he was in that movie?
Yeah, he was the father.
So, what happens in it?
Well, it's about a poor Irish family.
A little stereotypical, huh?
It's based on a book and it follows the author's life.
Oh, I see.
So, Angela's Ashes follows Frank, the author, in his life.
It sounds a little boring.
It can be slow, but it's a really good movie.
If you say so, where can I find it?
Probably on a streaming app, maybe Hulu?
Maybe. I'll look into it and tell you what I think.
Great! It's one of my favorite movies.
Then I need to see it.
Exactly!
See you!
