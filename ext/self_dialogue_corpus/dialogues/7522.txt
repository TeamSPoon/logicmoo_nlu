Do you enjpy the Harry potter movies
Yes i liked the order of the phoenix
That was when he was in the fifth year, right?
Yes it came out in 2007
That one was good
Its about time Harry learned more
Everyone treats him like a kid
Except dumbledore
Yea dumbledore expects a lot from him
Yea but harry can do it
