Can you name the best thriller ever made?
I would have to say The Shining.
Really? I would consider that to be a horror movie.
You could be right. How about Vanilla Sky
Is that the one with Tom Cruise?
Yea, him and Cameron Diaz.
That was a decent movie actually.
I think it is very underrated in terms of being a great movie.
It was good, but not one of the best ever!
You should watch it again, you might change your mind.
