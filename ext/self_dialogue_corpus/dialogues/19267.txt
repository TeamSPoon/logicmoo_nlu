If you picked an R&B artist as your favorite who would you pick?
Let me think, I have a few.
I would pick Ginuwine. He just had a certain soul to him when he sang.
I can see that, his music would really move you.
So who is your favorite artist?
I would have to say Mariah Carey, I think she would maybe fall under R&B.
Maybe so. She definitely has a gorgeous voice.
Right! I liked every single one of her songs.
Ginuwine sang that song "Pony", do you remember that?
Do I? Is the sky blue?
It was a definite mood setter.
Oh yes it was! My boyfriend would play that for me.
I loved his song "In Those Jeans" also.
Yes I remember singing that one day as I put on my jeans and got ready for school.
And I can't forget the song "So Anxious."
Of course! Another good mood setter song.
You couldn't listen to that song without wanting to make out with your boyfriend.
Yes yes yes! Good times those were.
He was a great artist, I miss singers like him.
I really do too.
