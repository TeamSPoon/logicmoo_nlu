I just watched Moana for the first time finally.
Did you like it? I love the music!
Yes, so much that I also just downloaded the soundtrack.
I think Lin-Manuel Miranda did an amazing job on his work with the music.
Yes, I really like "How Far I'll Go," but I enjoy every song on there.
I like the first song that Moana's father sings to her about the village.
The song with the crab guy is pretty strange, but I still like it.
I find it quite hilarious. The song seems inspired by David Bowie.
And The Rock singing "You're Welcome". I never knew he could sing!
Yes, he does a pretty good job at it, especially the rapping part.
