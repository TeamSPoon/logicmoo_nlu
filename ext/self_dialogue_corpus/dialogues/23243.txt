Have you seen Wonder Woman?
No, I haven't. Did you see it?
Yes, I did. I really liked it!
Was it like the other DC movies?
No, to me it felt really different! Gal Godot did a great job!
That's so good to hear, I want to go see it really badly!
I especially loved Chris Pine in it.
What was his character like?
He was a British spy in the military and he found Wonder Woman on her island.
I think Chris Pine is so cute. Was it a love story then?
A little bit, but it didn't overpower the main plot.
What was the plot anyways? Besides Wonder Woman kicking butt!
She was trying to find and defeat the god of war.
The god of war? Sounds crazy!
I don't want to spoil the ending, but it definitely was action packed!
I heard it got really good reviews.
So did I! And I'm glad!
Did you know Gal Godot was pregnant while filming?
No, I didn't know that! How cool!
Very cool, especially since I think she did a lot of the stunts.
