Do you like Tyler, the Creator?
I think he's got some interesting music, for sure.
I think he's good. He's really unique.
I thought "Wolf" was a good album. It was kind of weird, though.
He actually makes all of his own beats, too.
That's cool. It just shows that he's multi-talented.
A lot of his albums have a greater concept at play too.
I noticed he was talking about split personalities in "Yonkers".
Yeah, that's a theme through a couple of his albums.
I like when artists have a big enough mental capacity to create concepts like that.
