Okay I do not understand what is up with this movie Sharknado. Do you know anything?
Very little. I just know that is a comedy/thriller/disaster/scifi movie
How can a movie fit that many genre's? Must be really good ....yes I am being sarcastic.
You would not believe  how many famous people are in these movies.
Did I  see that right or was that a typo? MovieS?
Yes I am afraid so. There are 5 of them!
So they must be really great really horrible and people are just gluttons for crap.
Rotten Tomatoes gave the first one 4 stars.
What about the others?
The second one did well also but I think it started going down after that .I could be wrong though.
I looked up the cast and you weren't kidding. Tara Reid,Bo Derek, David Hasselhoff and a bunch more.
Weather man Al Roker. Politicians, news journalists,comedians child actors from days gone by and the list just keeps on going.
They couldn't possibly have very large parts but funny none the less that they chose to be in them.
Yeah maybe we should watch one together and see what the hype is all about.
It's always fun to see an actor that you haven't seen in forever.
This is true because some of these people you didn't know if they were still around or not.
Like Bo Derek. Who do you think is older her or the Hoff?
Hmm I don't know. Hoffman?
Yes he's 64 and Bo is 61.
wow time flies when you aren't looking
