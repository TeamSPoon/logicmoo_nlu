Have you seen the new Logan Movie?
Oh God yes I have!  It was amazing!
I agree.  I thought it was the best X-men movie to date.
I agree, although Days of Future Past was pretty good.
Yeah it was, but not quite to Logan standards.
Did you think Logan was better than Deadpool?
No way, Deadpool had everything. However, I do  think it was better told.
Yeah the story was better but Deadpool is just hilarious.
Yeah, I wish they did a crossover between the 2.
Yeah they do that in the comics a lot and it is usually pretty funny.
Sadly, with Jackman retiring from Wolverine, that won't happen
I know!  It makes me sad.
Me too.  But Oh well, maybe they will recast him.
I hope not!  Jackman is Wolverine
No doubt!  Have you seen the extended scenes in Logan
No I haven't.  Where did you watch them?
I saw them on YouTube.  But I am sure they will be on the DVD
I'll certainly buy the DVD when it comes out.
Oh me to.  I have all the other movies already.
Dang, you really are a fan!
