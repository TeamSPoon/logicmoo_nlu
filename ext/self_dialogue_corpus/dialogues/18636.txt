Are you a Drake fan?
Of course I'm a Drake fan!
Can you believe he was Jimmy in Degrassi?
No, he was not!
Yes, he was!  Check his IMDB page.
Oh my gosh, you're right.  I can't believe it!
I know right!  It's crazy that we grew up watching his acting and now we jam out to his music.
He's multi-talented.  I'll never forget when Jimmy got shot.
It was such a great episode, too!
I felt so sorry for Jimmy.  But look at him now!
I always look forward to when he drops an album.
Yes, it's always featured on Spotify as soon as it's released.
I'm glad he doesn't put his music only on Tidal.
Yeah, Spotify took most of Jay Z's stuff from his page.
I know, Beyonce's is still on there though.  Thankfully!
I hope it's not just a matter of time before she's gone, too.
I think the bee hive would revolt if that happened.
Yes, Bey loves her fans.  She would never do that.
Here's hoping at least.
I hate when musicians do random things like that.
