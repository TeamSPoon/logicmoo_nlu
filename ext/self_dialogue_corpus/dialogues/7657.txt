Which book is your favorite of the Harry Potter?
I loved book six.
You liked the one where Dumbledore dies?
It had a lot of dramatic effect. There was a lot of answers to questions, too.
Yes, I always thought Dumbledore should have gotten more of a send-off.
You're right, Aragorn and Dobby both got more page time than he did.
He had a legacy to live on, neither Dobby or the spider did.
I guess in a way, Dumbledore continues on in the painting.
I was always confused about whether they were ghosts or just magically imbued with their essence.
I don't think there is a solid answer, but I don't think Dumbledore became a ghost.
