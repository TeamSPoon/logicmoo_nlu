Johnny Cash is one of my favorite artists.
Me too. I love his song Orange Blossom Special.
I'm impressed. Not a lot of people know that song.
I know. It seems he is most famous for Ring of Fire, Walk The Line, and Folsom Prison Blues.
I agree. A Boy Named Sue is pretty popular, too.
That song is so funny. Have you ever heard One Piece At A Time?
Yes, that song is funny as well.
I really like the song Jackson that he did with his wife, June Carter.
Me too. They did a lot of songs together.
I know. I like It Ain't Me Babe, too.
I've never heard any of her solo songs.
Me either.
I know she helped write the sing Ring of Fire.
Really? I didn't know that.
Yep. It must have been rewarding to help write one of her husband's biggest hits.
I can only imagine.
It's so weird how some artists don't write their own songs.
I know. When I was little I didn't realize that they didn't always write their songs.
Me too, but it still takes a good artist to bring a song to life.
Oh, I totally agree.
