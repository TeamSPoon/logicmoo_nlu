what movie are you dying to see?
I can't wait for the new sofia coppola film.
I did not know she has one coming out.
ya I can hardly wait!
What is it called?
The Beguiled . The trailer looks amazing!
Wait wasn't that a clint eastwood movie,the begulied?
Yes, it is a remake somewhat but with a very different take.
I am imagine a much more feminine one. WHo is eastwood's character played by?
John McBurney is Colin Farrell in this one.
Oh nice I enjoy him.
I think the female actors are going to be the real show stopping performances though.
Probably right on that hunch with sofia. Who else is cast?
Nicole Kidman, Kristen dunst.
Kristen Dunst was so good in fargo season 2.
Agreed, I think they may have been on of her best roles films included.
Certainly better than Bring it on.
I like Bring it on, but fargo was higher caliber and much better performance!
100% agree.Did  you know in real life she is now engaged to the guy who played her husband.
Really? Jesse plemons. Interesting.
