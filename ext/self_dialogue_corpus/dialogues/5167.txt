Did you see the new Cars 3 movie?
Not yet, have you?
Yes, we went the first day it came out! I think they get better and better each movie.
Really? Did they have the same characters in this one?
Yes, all the same characters Mater, Sally, Mack, and more.
Great I love Mater he is one of my favorite characters!
I know I think the actor Larry the Cable Guy who plays him does a great job.
I do too he really makes Mater believable and funny.
I definitely recommend going and seeing it because it had some great comedic moments and a great story line.
Cool, I'll see about taking the kids this weekend.
