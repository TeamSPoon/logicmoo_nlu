Who do you think wins the NFC South this year?
Not sure, do you think Atlanta repeats?
Could be, this is a tough division to predict.
The Panthers were great just one year before and could be a threat.
I didn't see how they went down so fast last year.
Cam Newton is a tough player.
Do you think the Bucs have any chance?
With picking up Desean Jackson I think their offense improves.
With the deep threat they can stretch the field.
He is worth a touchdown deep ball a game I think.
He does that but the overall game isn't as strong.
I heard the Saints picked up Adrian Peterson.
Maybe so but I don't think this team is going anywhere again.
Drew Brees is getting older and they just don't have the team around him.
I think it will either be Atlanta or Carolina.
I agree but I think the Bucs will be better.
Still I can't see two teams that went to the Superbowl the last couple of years being unseated.
I think Carolina just had one of those wierd down years even though they still had a good team.
I think they could bounce back this year.
It will be tough with Matt Ryan and all the talent Atlanta still has.
