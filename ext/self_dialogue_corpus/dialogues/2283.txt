Do you follow the Hokies that play in the NFL?
Absolutely! I love the success Tyrod Taylor is having with Buffalo.
He's such a great kid. Any others?
Sure, the Fuller brothers are exceptional.
I knew Kendall Fuller signed with the Redskins.
Right, and Corey is with New Orleans.  Kyle went with Chicago.
What a family! The other legacy family didn't do as well.
You must be talking about Michael and Marcus Vick.
What losers.  Michael, so talented and then got caught up in that dog fighting thing.
I know, right?  Michael was horrible and Marcus was a criminal. Could have been so different.
Did you know Sam Rogers is with the LA Rams?  The kid walked on for Beamer.
Amazing. I love a good walk on story.
Who else?
I should have mentioned that two other Hokies, besides Tyrod, play for Buffalo.
Really, who?
Logan Thomas plays tight end.
And who else?
Nigel Williams plays defensive end.
Once a Hokie, always a Hokie!
Even in the NFL. Glad you kept track of these players. I'll pay more attention to Buffalo this season.
