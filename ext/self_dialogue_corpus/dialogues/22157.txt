What movies are you interested in seeing?
Ill be honest there is nothing coming out soon that interests me.
Is that what it has come to in Hollwood?
I think so, its in a terrible state.
What about the new Spiderman?
Not even looking at that one.
Why not?
I think they have reincarnated that movie too many times.
Thats insane! I think youre crazy
This is the third version of it.
Yeah but each one gets better.
I think the ANdrew Garfield ones were terrible
I think Maguire was a bad actor in them
He owned it, just got bored of it quickly.
They had great villains
Who is the villain in this one?
I think it is Vulture.
Who is playing him?
If I recall correctly it is Michael Keaton.
He should be great.
