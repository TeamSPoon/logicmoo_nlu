So man, you hear they are talking of doing guaranteed contracts in the NFL?
I don't see that ever working out, it doesn't make sense.
Well, I mean I'm sure it would lead to shorter contracts, like two or three years each.
Right now it's only the first 20 or so player that get their full contract pay guaranteed at the draft, right?
Yeah, then the others have to negotiate how much of their contract is or not, like how many years.
Yeah but if everyone had shorter contracts, plus guaranteed pay, people would be moving around all the time. Teams would change a lot.
But maybe not, this would make the teams give better deals, and treat the whole team better, and as more of a whole, I think.
I don't know, maybe it's better for the players, but not the teams or the fans. Just when you like a team, the whole thing will change.
We already deal with a lot of change in the teams, fans are loyal to their team, not their player.
Not all the time, a lot of fans stick to one player, and if they are routing for a new team every few years, may take some of the fun out of it for them.
I see what you are saying, and maybe it would be out of wack for a few years, but it would work out and balance in the end.
I still don't agree, but what are the chances this is even going to happen?
I don't know, it would probably have to take one team doing it, then all players wanting to go to them, for others to follow suit.
So no one has done it yet?
Not really, but Dolphins defensive Suh does have a fully guaranteed 3 year plus rolling guarantees for 18-20 so it's close.
But still, the "rolling" part gives the team a little control there, I don't see them giving that control up.
You might be right, but I'd still like to see it happen. The players make the game and this is the best deal for them.
Maybe, but if it makes fans back away, it hurts everyone so I don't know man.
Well, the next few seasons should be interesting, I bet at least things change a bit.
They change a bit every year.
