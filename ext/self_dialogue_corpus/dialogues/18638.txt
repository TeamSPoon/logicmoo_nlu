So who do you think is the most underrated country music band?
That is a tough question, do you have anyone in mind?
Well I have to say that I am a big fan of The Band Perry.
Yeah they are pretty good. I would have to say that my favorite song of theirs is If I Die Young.
I like that one too. My favorites would have to be You Lie and All Your Life.
I would have to say that one of the best country bands would have to be Lady Antebellum.
Oh I had forgotten about them. They definitely have some good ones.
Yeah their song Need You Know is one of the best that I have heard.
Oh my gosh, I almost forgot about one of the best bands ever.
Who is that?
Rascal Flatts! They are amazing.
I can't believe that we forgot about them.
What is your favorite song of theirs?
I would definitely have to say What Hurts The Most.
That is an awesome song but it is very sad.
Yeah it is. What is your favorite song of theirs?
I would have to say Bless the Broken Road and My Wish.
Those are both awesome songs.
I would like to go to a Rascal Flatts concert. I bet it would be awesome.
We will have to look for tickets online and go together!
