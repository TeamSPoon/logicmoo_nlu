What's your favorite Ed Sheeran song?
Shape of you for sure.
Good song, but why?
Well, women love it and hate being objectified. But it's ALL about objectification.
So you're saying women are hypocritical?
If they love this song and hate it, then possibly.
Okay... you're weird. I like Thinking Out Loud.
Which is that? I don't know too much of him.
That's the really sweet love song "People fall in love in mysterious ways"
Oh, right. I can at least appreciate that he learned the dance and didn't hire Ron Weasely for it.
