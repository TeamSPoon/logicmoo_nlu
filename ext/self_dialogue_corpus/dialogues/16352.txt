How crazy is it that New Found Glory is still making music?
It is not that crazy they are a good band.
But to be around this long is insane nowadays.
Funny thing is they probably dont get in the rock and roll hall of fame.
Why do you say that?
Because typically bands from this genre dont get in.
Because they arent on a major label?
No because they arent radio hits.
What is actually even played on radio anymore?
I know thats sort of my point.
So if they played semi-indie music from Britain they would be in?
Yeah sure if you look at it that way
What other way is there?
They just dont have a song that the masses know.
I think they have a ton of hits
But thats with a specific group of people
So their music doesnt have mass appeal?
I wouldnt say they dont have mass appeal but its just not there with sales.
They have survived this long I think they are doing just fine.
They do have quite an exquisite tour bus from what I have seen.
