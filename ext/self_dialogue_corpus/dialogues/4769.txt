So, what do you think about the Cubs this year?
I am not a Chicago fan, so I haven't been following them too closely.
They haven't been doing that good.
That is surprising, considering they are coming off a World Series win.
I know, I thought they would be doing better.
What is their record?
They are at 21 and 19 right now.
Wow, that is not bad...but not great.
I think the problem is really in their pitching.
How are they doing in that category?
Well, their overall team ERA is under 4.00, but a few of their key starters are struggling?
Yeah, that hurts if they can't get good starts out of these guys.
For example, Lackey is over 4.2 and Arrieta is over 5.00!
Ouch, how is Lester doing this year?
Much better, his ERA is under 4.
Good, but they need a team effort to be competitive this year.
I know, especially since the Brewers are on fire.
I did not expect that team to be doing so good.
The Cubs are going to have to step it up as summer approaches.
Maybe they can make some trades that would help them.
