Let's talk Bruno Mars. Do you think he is the best pop singer of our generation?
He is definitely at the top, I don't know if he is the best.
He has had so many hits in the last few years though.
He has, but so have other pop singers.
Well who would you say is the best?
I think the band Maroon 5 is up there.
Why them?
They have been around for quite a while now and have had so many #1's.
Well, I would put them as #2 on my top pop singers chart.
Fair, I would put Bruno Mars as #2 on my pop chart.
