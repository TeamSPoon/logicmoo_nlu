Do you remember the 2000 Seattle Seahawks?
Boy what a team! They finished 6â€“10 that year.
Jon Kitna was in his absolute prime.
No one could argue that. They also got Alexander in the draft.
He should be in the Hall of Fame.
Alexander? That's a questionable assertion.
Not questionable at all. I don't believe he should be excluded.
He was NFL MVP one year.
And they got him in 2000. No doubt.
Who else did they get in 2000?
They selected Chris McIntosh as well as Darrell Jackson.
If only they could have held on to Jackson!
I know! He was great San Francisco.
Absolutely. In his seventh year? He was spectacular.
I guess time wins all battles.
That's a very good NFL statement.
Time does often win.
It does. The team with the worst NFL record gets the first draft pick.
Eventually, that team becomes the best and gets the last pick.
The system works.
