What do you think of music today? Are there any new artist you like
I think most of it's garbage. The whole auto today or is it just raced a true singers.
I agree with you. There are very few artists you actually can really sing.
Adele is somebody that can really sing her ass off.
You can say that again. That woman's got some pipes on her.
That Meghan Trainor girl seems to have a really good voice as well. I like some of her songs because they're fun.
I agree, I had a chance to listen to our whole album and a lot of the songs on there really fun and made you want to dance
I heard Lady Gaga alive on the Howard Stern show. She sounded great.
I've heard her sing live a couple times on TV and she sounded really good. She's one of the few who doesn't need auto tune.
What about someone like Reanna.
Not a huge fan there. I think she has a decent voice but I deathly think there's a lot of help behind it.
Look at someone like Britney Spears that had a huge career. She can't sing a damn lick.
Don't even get me started on Justin Bieber. In my humble at 10 opinion, he's a war singer than I am.
If he was just somebody that was standing in a crowd and started singing he would be booed beyond believe.
There is the new guys out there that can really saying. Ed Sheeran, John legend, and Sam Smith really have a great voices.
That's true, those guys can really sing. Ed Sharon really has a good set of vocal chords
I first heard Sam Smith sing on Saturday night live.
I did too. I went out the next day and downloaded his songs.
Besides that, music today at shit.
I agree with you my friend.  It isn't like it used to be.
