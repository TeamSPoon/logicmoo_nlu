So who do you like better, Christina Aguilera or Britney Spears?
Gosh, that's a no brainer!  I love Britney Spears' music.
Yeah, her music is definitely great, but I like Christina better as a person.
Well Britney definitely has had some bad press.  But her music is just incredible.
I did like the originals.  Oops I Did It Again is amazing and so is Hit Me Baby One More Time.
I know.  I don't think Christina has anything similar.
No, you're probably right.  Her best song was probably Genie in a Bottle.
Yeah exactly, and while catchy it doesn't compare to Britney's hits.
Well, they were both on that Mickey Mouse Club back when they were children, remember?
Yeah, I wonder if they knew each other.
I do not know.  They both have children now, don't they?
Yeah, I don't think they're making music anymore.  I'm not sure.
Well, I wonder who the next pop princess will be.
I'm not sure.  Seems like there's always someone new coming up.
Miley Cyrus definitely fell short.
Yeah, she seemed good at first but then she went off the deep end.
Kinda similar to Britney, I'd say.
I'd say she's much worse than Britney.  Britney got bizarre but never downright offensive.
Well that's a good point.  No, I guess it's not the same.
No.  And Miley's music was never as good.
