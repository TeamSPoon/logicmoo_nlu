Have you heard the latest Katy Perry songs?
I havent heard her newest stuff yet.
She has this one song, Chained to the Rhythm, it is excellent.
I like her music.
This song is extra special too, she has changed her style a bit from 10 years ago.
She is a smart lady.
Yes her lyrics are great and the energy is spectacular.
That is what I like about her.
This song is a great example of how powerful of a singer she is.
Thank you for telling me about this song, I will listen to it.
