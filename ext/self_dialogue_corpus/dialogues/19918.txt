Do you like John Mayer?
I don't really know much of his music.
Well, the song most people know is Your Body Is A Wonderland.
Yeah, I know that song, but I don't really like it.
He has much better music than that!
What song do you recommend?
One of my favorite songs of his is Gravity.
I haven't heard that one, I'll check it out.
Awesome, I hope you like it!
Anything else I should know about him?
Yeah, he's a great guitarist.
Cool, I love a great guitar riff.
He's also an incredible lyricist, he works all his own songs.
That's cool! I like the singer-songwriter genre.
Yeah, he's really multitalented.
Sounds like it!
He just came out with a new album.
What's it called?
It's called The Search For Everything.
Awesome, I'll check it out. Thanks!
