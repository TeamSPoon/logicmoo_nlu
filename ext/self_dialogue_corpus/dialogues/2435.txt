Who won the MVP for the NFL this year ?
I think Matt Ryan, that quarterback for the Atlanta Falcons won last year
He is their star player, no doubt.
They could not have chosen a better player Matt Ryan is the tops
He was competing with Tom Brady
Who does Tom Brady play for?
New England Patriots
Who has the best stats
Matt Ryan obviously with almost 5,000 rushing yards
Very valuable to his team !
What about Tom Brady, what are his stats?
Well he had more than 3500 rushing yards
So Matty 'Ice' was obviously the best choice
Yes but both are pretty good!
Who do you think will win next year
That remains to be seen
Im thinking Drew Brees, possibley even Christian McCaffrey
Ah Drew Brees. I forgot about him but he is a great player for his team
They all are great players
Yeah I guess we will  just have to wait and see
