I am a big fan of Lady Gaga.
So am I. She is such a good dancer.
I know. She always twitches.
Her voice is amazing. I loved her tribute to David Bowie at the Grammys.
I know! I honestly don't think anyone else could have pulled that off.
I would love to see her live.
Me too. I think she might be going on tour later this year.
Have you heard her new song, "The Cure?"
No, I haven't heard it yet. What is your favorite Gaga song?
All time favorite? Just Dance.
