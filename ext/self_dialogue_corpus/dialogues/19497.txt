Did you pick up the new Imagine Dragons album?
No.  Is it out?
Yes, it was just released on Friday.
So what's the verdict?
Pretty good.  I think the first half of the album is better than the second half.
I heard it's very electronic.
Yeah, a bit too much in places.
Just seems like what a lot of groups are doing nowadays.
Most of the songs you've heard on the radio are the best ones.
I do enjoy that Thunder song.
Yeah, that one is pretty good.  Got a good beat.
I'm so sick of Believer.
Yeah, it's been overdone way too much.
I turn my radio when it comes on.
I do like Walking the Wire.
That's probably the best song on the album I think.
It's either that or Whatever It Takes
Either are great choices.
Can you make me a copy of the album?
I'll let you borrow it if you like.
