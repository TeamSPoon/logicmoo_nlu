What is your opinion on Reboot  films?
I am not a fan of them to be honest with you.
How do you feel they have done, good or bad?
I'd say most reboot films are awful attempts at bringing back a popular series.
Which would you say was the worst three reboots you've seen?
I'd say Terminator Genisys, Total Recall, and Ghost Busters. What about you?
Nightmare on Elm Street, The Thing and also Ghost Busters.
Wait The Thing wasn't a reboot film.
It wasnt? Are you sure?
Yeah, didn't you see it?
Not the entire thing. I fell asleep about 15 minutes in.
Wow. The movie was that good huh?
Yeah, best I've ever seen.
Ha. On serious note it was a prequel to the original film. The director even commented on it.
What did he say?
He said the film was originally suppose to be a full on remake, but he would consider it an insult to try and recreate an already great film.
That is interesting. So how did it turn out to be a prequel?
He basically begged the studio to change it.
Wow he must of been a big fan of the original.
The orginal is a cult classic and in my opinion should never be reinvented. The director feels the same way.
