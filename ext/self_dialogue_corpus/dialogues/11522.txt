Don't The Beatles just make you want to curl up on the beach and take a nap?
Never thought about it like that, but I guess so.
Yeah! The perfect chill music.
They're so old, though.
Yeah they're mostly dead, but that's not the point of music is it?
I guess not.
If only they could have reunited first.
That would have been pretty cool
I'd have some new chill music, at least!
Here Comes the Sun is pretty good
