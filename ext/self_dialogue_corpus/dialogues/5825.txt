I love the movie Snow White.
Me too, aren't the dwarfs adorable?
yes they are, my favorite is Doc.
I really like Grumpy.
And the old witch with the apple is great!
Yes she is. Take a bite of my apple dearie!
Snow White was so pretty even though she is animated!
Yes, and the house they all lived in was so cute
Yes. The music was great as well.
I agree.
