I love watching Behind the Scenes for Disney films.
I do too. It makes you really appreciate the time and dedication they put into their work.
For sure. And some of the scenes they share are funny too.
Are you talking about the classic Lion King?
Haha, yeah - with the 3D model of Mufasa's death.
Oh my god, yeah! The voice acting was so serious but the animation was so stiff!
That's what made it hilarious! Scar's neck and arms were stretching across the cliff when he was threatening Mufasa.
Right right! And then Mufasa's model just tumbled down into a river of still antelopes!
Then Simba's face was stuck making that "ah" face!
Haha, that was too funny. Almost uncanny, really!
