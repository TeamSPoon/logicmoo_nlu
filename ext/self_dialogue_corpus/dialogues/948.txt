Who do you think is the greatest NFL team of all time?
Pittsburgh Steelers
What?! How can you say that?
They've won 6 Super Bowls
But what about the Patriots?
They've only won 5
Yeah, but they have Tom Brady.
You asked me about the greatest team in the NFL, not the QB
Well, I think the Patriots have the upper hand.
How so?
They have more iconic players and they've done more recently.
You're forgetting about the Steelers of the 70s.
I'm too young to remember.
That's the problem. You're only comparing recent history.
Well it was a different generation of football back then.
Doesn't matter. Still in the Super Bowl era.
Yeah, but the game's changed so much since the 70s.
But those earlier Super Bowls still count.
I don't think so.
Well I think you're wrong.
