Do you like Taylor Swift?
That is a really difficult question to answer?
Why is that?
I think her songs are catchy, and she's a really talented songwriter. However, I don't think she can sing that well.
Really? I think millions of people would say differently!
I'm sure they would, but I've always thought she sounded awful live.
I guess I've never really heard that.
Now that she's gone to pop especially, it's much more autotuned.
When did she make the crossover from country to pop?
Well, she was always more of a pop country artist, but I think her album Red really started getting away from country.
I see. Did she ever officially say she was no longer a country artist.
I don't know, but I know she identified her latest album, 1989, as a true pop album.
It's too bad that she went away from her country roots.
I know, but I guess her subject matter lends itself better to pop anyway.
And she has more commercial appeal as a pop star.
Exactly. But I will always love her first two albums especially.
What were they?
Taylor Swift and Fearless. They had so many great songs.
Wasn't her first single called Tim McGraw?
I belive it was. Kind of funny, isn't it?
