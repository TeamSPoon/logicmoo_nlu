Bridesmaids is probably one of my favorite movies of all time.
I like it too. That part where they all got food poisoning had me almost crying it was so funny.
I thought that scene was great too! I liked the scene where Kristen Wiig's character was trying to give a speech in Spanish.
I know, that scene was hilarious! I thought all the actresses were great in that movie.
I feel like Melissa McCarthy became famous because of that movie.
Did you know her husband is in Bridesmaids too?
No, who was he?
He was the security guard on the airplane.
I never realized that! That's kind of cool.
Yeah, I think I saw that online somewhere.
