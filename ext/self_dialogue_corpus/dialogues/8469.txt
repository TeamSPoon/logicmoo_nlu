Remember Natalie Imbruglia's Torn?
I"m all out of faith, this is how I feel..
Looks like you do.
Do you know she's not the original singer of it?
Really?
Yeah, it's a cover of a song that came out a half decade earlier.
Wow, I had no idea.
Yeah, that version is more rock-forward
Which is better?
Natalie's for sure. But then again, Australian pop wasn't a thing until the mid-90's.
