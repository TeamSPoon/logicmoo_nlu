Okay what was your favorite Disney movie growing up?
Oooh this is a tough question! I'm going to have to go with The Little Mermaid.
Yeah Ariel was a pretty cool chick. And the songs in that movie were so good!
Did you know that The Little Mermaid won a Golden Globe for its original score?
I didn't know that! That's amazing.
So what was your favorite?
I loved Beauty and the Beast. I must have watched that movie 50 times.
Beauty and the Beast has the best characters in it! Lumiere, Cogsworth, Mrs. Potts, Chip! So my good ones!
Agreed! And I loved that Belle really loved reading cause I loved reading when I was little too.
And that she didn't like Gaston! He was such a bro.
