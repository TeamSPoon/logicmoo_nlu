DId you know Katey Sagal the actress also sings?
She does? Is she good?
I think she has a unique sound.
SHe was on Sons of Anarchy right?
Yes, if you have seen that show then you have heard her sing.
How so?
She sang a lot of songs that were played on that show.
Really? I may have heard her sing!
She is not bad, but nothing brilliant.
I would imagine she would have a soulful voice.
Yes, it is soulful, like I said a little unique as well.
There are a lot of actors that can sing as well.
Some of those people have so much talent, I wish I could sing and act.
Me too, but I think I would rather be a singer than a actress.
I agree, I think singing can allow someone to express themselves better.
Would you ever buy any of her music?
Most likely not, I have not went online to actually listen to more of it.
Did you like the songs she did on SOA though?
Yes I did, some of them grew on me.
I will check them out.
