We are looking for a family friendly movie
What is the movie for
Our community has movie night in the park, everyone brings a blanket and we provide the popcorn
are you looking for animated?
it doesnt have to be, it just has to be fun for all ages
What about inside out, everyone can relate to the thought in our brains
I love that movie, I will for sure keep that in  mind
What about the life of pets
That movie is so cute, thats another great one, any more ideas?
How to train your dragon?
Thats it, I will do that one for sure
I love toothless, he is the best dreamworks character
I agree, its like he is smiling
everyone can relate to his adversity, as well as the boys
Yes, he is a little guy in his village of vikings, and they make him feel small
another great dragon movie is draonheart
I love that one, Im just not sure the little ones wouldnt get scared
Thats true
I will stick with our original choice, thanks for your help
Anytime
