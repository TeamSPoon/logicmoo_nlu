What's your favorite rock band? Mine is Nine Inch Nails.
I like them too. My favorite song is "Bite the Hand that Feeds" hands down!
I used to be the biggest Korn fan ever. I jammed "Coming Undone" relentlessly.
I never get tired of listening to Nirvana. Kurt Cobain was a legend who will forever be missed.
Yeah, that is true. I loved how David Grohl transitioned to the band Foo Fighters.
Totally! My jam is The Pretender. I also like "The Best of You.
What about the group Disturbed? They have some pretty awesome hits.
I used to have the album 10,000 Fists. I never knew what happened to it.
I like their remake of Land of Confusion and the music video was really good.
