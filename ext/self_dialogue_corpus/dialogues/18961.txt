Hey you know what song I really like right now?
Which song is that brah?
The new one by chainsmokers and coldplay
What? Those are two separate bands-- how would they come together?
yeah brah.. the song is called something like this
Hmm I never heard of it.
I can play it for you on my iphone
Ok.. Let me listen
wow that is an awesome song!
Yeah I like the message-- we are not all superheros but we try our best
Yes its a positive message!
I'm really tired of music with negative messages now a days
I also admire Chris Martin he is such a great artist
Do you see he can play almost every instrument!
I saw that during the concert for Manchester
I want to hear more from coldplay!
Its my pleasure to share
Thanks so much
Next time you have any songs you want to share definitely let me know
Ok no problem friend!
