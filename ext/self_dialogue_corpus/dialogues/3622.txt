Have you seen Get Out yet?
I did! I absolutely loved it!
Me too! Such a good slow-burn horror movie.
Yeah, not so reliant on constant jumps and jolts. Very creepy.
And the ending was great!
Yeah, I really liked how they trick us into feeling a sense of dread when the police lights appear in the distance.
I agree. It really makes the viewer feel what many black men probably feel when they see them in general.
I love it when movies can successfully pull off a strong message like that.
Me too, especially when they can still be entertaining.
This was an excellent film and I can't wait to see what he comes up with next.
