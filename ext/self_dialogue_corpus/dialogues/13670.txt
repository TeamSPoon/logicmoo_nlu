The serial escalation in Star Wars is kind of dumb, honestly.
What are you referring to?
So, for example, you've got the Death Star, right?
Yeah, what about it?
Well, it's huge and it blows up planets. Then comes the Death Star II.
Yeah, that one was even bigger.
Right, and they followed it up with Starkiller Base. A planet that eats stars and blows up many planets.
It does sound a little silly when you put it like that. Maybe in the next one have a solar system sized weapon powered by a black hole.
You joke, but the odds that of that happening are higher than you think.
Never tell me the odds.
