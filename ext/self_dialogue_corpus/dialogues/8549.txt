If he was around still do you think Elvis would be considered pop?
Yes I do he was definitely one of those kinds of artists
He did span a variety of genres.
Yes but they all had mass appeal which is really what pop music is
Hound dog would be a radio hit in my opinion.
Yes it would be and jailhouse rock would be an anthem for people
He really wrote a ton of great stuff.
And he made everyone like him too
Did he write his own music?
For the most part he did.
