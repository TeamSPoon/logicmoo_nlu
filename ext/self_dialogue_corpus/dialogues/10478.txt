Hey, I'm really in to Migos just as you suggested.
They are great, right ?
I had a different perception for them. I was surprised by their new album Culture.
Which song did you liked the most ?
It's got to be T-Shirt. This song is everywhere now.
Did you know that it has more than 150 million views on youtube ?
That is amazing ! Which song did you like the most ?
Kelly Price with Travis Scott.
Oh yeah ? What is that about ?
Their usual, drug and women lifestyle. It is interesting, however, that it the song title is the name a famous RnB singer.
That is really cool.
And their continue to name drop through out the song.
Who is it produced by ?
I'm not sure, but surprisingly not by Travis.
Yeah, you would expect to produce that. He always does !
Yeah, but he just dropped 3 new song on WorldStart !
Oh, are they any good ?
One of them. Butterfly Effect has a sick beat. You should hear it.
Oh. I'll definitely will. Where can I find the song again ?
Just look it up on youtube.
