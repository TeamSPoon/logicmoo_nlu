Did you see the Predator against the Ducks game yesterday?
Was that a NHL Conference game?
Yes, it was a great game! Super!
What was the final Score and who won?
The final score was 5-3 and the Ducks won! That is my favorite team!
Mine too! I've been a Ducks fan since I was 8 years old.
Rinne took a pretty big shot off the mask to end the Anaheim shift. He hung in there though, and it opened the door for Forsberg shoot.
I bet that gave Gibson a little bit of trouble! HA.
What number is Forsberg?
He is number 9.
The Ducks got a jolt and they've found their skating legs to spice up the game.
What player tied the game, 2-2 ?
Jakob Silfverberg was the one who tied it up for the Ducks turning it into a 2-2 game.
Oh, I know that Rinne is a great goalie and would turn it around!
Yeah, I think #35 Rinne is the best goalie in the league!
Who lead in penalties?
The Ducks led the whole first but we can see that turned around eventually!
Right on! Was the the first NHL Conference game?
No, that was game two of the Conference.
Thank you for all the extra game info! Appreciate it!
