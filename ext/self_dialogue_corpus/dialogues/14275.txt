Did you see the game between the warriors and the cavs last night?
Yes I sure did it was a barn burner.
It was back and forth every quarter
Yeah I know I didn't know who was going to pull it out.
Yeah lebron went off i think he had 42 points.
Yeah he did Curry's 38 wasnt enough to push the warriors over the top
Lebron is just unreal he took over that fourth quarter
Yeah he did, thompson hit that three to tie it up with a minute left I thought they had a chance.
I know right
Its hard to stop erving, love and james just too much there
Yeah these two teams are just to loaded makes for great games
Everytime they play its a nail bitter
James has to be the greatest right now it just takes over
Yeah when he hit that jumper with 15 sec left put them up 4 was just amazing.
Its still hard to count curry out but just wasnt enough.
Yeah I cant wait to watch them play again
Me either its always great
One of these teams will win the trophy again for sure
Yes i cant wait for that finals again
Definitley have to get your popcorn ready
