Have you ever heard of Enya?
I think so. It is a female artist or a group?
Enya is a lady and she has the most beautiful music I have ever heard.
What kind of music does she sing? It sounds like it is not heavy metal or rock.
Not at all... Enya sings like an angel and she has the most soft almost spiritual sounding background music.
Really? I like that kind of music. It helps me to relax.
Yeah... before my mom passed away she asked me to play Enya for her. My family and I played Enya in the background for almost 10 hours straight.
Aw.. that sounds so sad.. Your mom loved Irish music. Is Enya Irish?
Actually she is. As far as I know Enya is born and raised in Ireland. She even owns a castle that she uses for her home.
Is here music like traditional Irish ballads? I know your mom liked that stuff.
No, actually Enya is more lie new age music. It is hard to describe since she is just so unique.
Hmmm. I love new age stuff. Is it like Yanni?
Actually it is Enya, though, has her own twist that I find to be unlike any other.
Are all Enya's sounds the same.. like the same music in the background?
No, that s another thing I love about Enya. She seems to have an eerie, almost scary, song on each of her albums.
What kind of scary? Like loud and 'catch you off guard type'?
No, that's what makes Enya's eeriness more unique. Her song still keeps that soft soothing sound but with this fright to it.
Wow.. I think I may like to hear her.
If you pick up one of Enya's albums you have to listen to the whole thing straight through to really get her theme.
I will definitely check Enya out. She really sounds like someone I would like to listen to.
