Did you watch the basketball game last night?
Yeah it was great, I am surprised they won!
Did you bet any money on the game?
Yeah, I did. I bet around one thousand and won five thousand.
Are you going to keep betting on basketball games?
Yeah and I hope I win too.
Any other good games on tonight?
I don't think so.
I'm going to the game on Saturday night. Do you wanna come?
Yeah what time is it?
It is at 8'Clock, I can drive.
Awesome, come over at 6.
Yeah I will. It is going to be a great game.
Yeah, I hope. They need this game for the playoffs.
I think our team will win.
Me too. This is going to be a great game.
Do you want to go to a restaurant before the basketball game?
Yeah lets do it.
I think it will be cheaper than eating at the arena.
Totally.
