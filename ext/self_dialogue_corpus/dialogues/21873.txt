What kind of movies do you like?
I don't have a favorite genre necessarily. I just tend to like whatever's good and thought provoking, so maybe dramas.
Yeah, that makes sense. That's probably my favorite genre as well.
It's weird. I don't like horror films, and it's not really horror, but Silence of the Lambs is one of my favorite movies.
Really? I can understand that. Anthony Hopkins was awesome.
Yeah, definitely. Great directing too.
Absolutely. I heard the director, Jonathan Demme passed away recently.
Yeah, i saw that. Sad..he wasn't very old either.
Yeah.
Agent Starling's boss in that movie..well his character was based on one of our neighbors when i was growing up.
Is that right?
Yeah, he was the head of criminal behavior at the FBI in Quantico.
Interesting!
I also learned some trivia about that famous line of Lecter's "i ate his liver with some fava beans and a nice chianti"
Oh yeah, what 's that?
Well there are certain psychiatric medicines called MAOI's which require one to abstain from certain foods and drinks, and two of those are chianti and fava beans.
Wow, so what is the meaning of the line then?
Well, i think it's meant to indicate that Dr. Lecter was not taking his meds when he killed the victime he's speaking of.
Oh right, cause he himself was a psychiatric patient, i had forgotten that!
Yes, exactly!
