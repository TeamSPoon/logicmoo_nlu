Do you ever teach music theory with musicals?
Of course! We have to keep it relevant to the students. They don't all care about Montiverdi.
Which are your favorites to use?
It's hard because there's so much offensive stuff that can get me in trouble.
So, which?
The Music Man, West Side Story, and The Book of Mormon.
The Book of Mormon, seriously?
Yup, of course!
How'd you get away with that? It's super offensive!
They love it, actually, and I'm able to find plenty of excerpts that are innocent.
Like what?
"Turn it off" is a great example, I just cut it short before the crap about spousal abuse.
Yeah, that's rough.
What's that song a good example of?
It's a perfect example of a viio7/ii.
Seriously?
Yup, all the voice-leading is correct with proper resolutions!
Can you hear everything, or is it kind of in the background?
With the instrumentation, it's pretty obvious.
Nice! I'll have to look into it.
