What is the worst song you have ever heard?
Oh, that's easy!
Easy?  It took me weeks to decide on an answer to that question!
Then you have never heard this song.
I am sure you are mistaken. I have taken Master's level courses in "Music Theory" , as well as "Contemporary Music as an Artform"...
I still don't think you have heard this particular song.
I have studies the genre's of Pop, Rock, Soul, Jazz, Opera....
Still think you are clueless.
I know every song from Cole Porter to the Beatles, Aretha Franklin to James Brown, The Osmonds to the Jackson Five, and I have listened to every classical classical number ever written!
Still clueless.
Clueless? Why, I have a Ph.D. in Musical History from Harvard.
You still wouldn't know. You couldn't know.
I was the Jeopardy game show all-time winner because of my in depth knowledge in music! Of course I could know!
You think so?
I know so!
Ok Mr. Musical genius. What song did my daughter make up jusy last evening?
What?
That's right, the worst song I ever heard was made up by my daughter last night. It's called "Itsy Bitsy Potty"
I don't know that one. How could I know a song your daughter just made up...a horrible-sounding song your daughter just created?
Yes, the worst song ever!  But for some reason, it may be my favorite!
