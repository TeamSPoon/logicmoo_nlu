You should totally see this new movie called "Keanu".
Isn't that the one made by Key and Peele?
Yeah, and it is hilarious. I think you would really enjoy it.
What is it even about? Some kind of cat, right?
Okay,  it's about a cat, but it's about so much more than that.
Sound's kind of boring, what's so special about it?
Well, let's just say that Key's cat is stolen by accident, and they both kind of become hard core gangsters to get it back.
Ha! So they go on drive by's, and drug deals, and stuff like that?
Pretty much. One scene I think you'll really love has to do with four gang members in a minivan singing George Michael together.
Now that sounds pretty interesting to say the least. Is it kind of like their TV show?
A little bit, but this is more rounded like a movie. That new one that Keegan Michael-Key made is really good too.
You mean "Get Out"? I heard that was good.
Oh yeah, its fantastic. Think of like the worst fears that a black man might have about white people actually being realized.
Oh, I dont know if I would like that. Sounds more like a drama or scary movie.
That's the thing, it starts off with these fears being realized, but as the movie progresses the fears start becoming outlandish.
Like how? They just treat him terribly?
Well, it starts off with the obvious things happening, like them making jokes at his expense, but then it starts to get crazier and crazier after the girls mom hypnotizes him.
She hypnotizes him? White people don't do that. Jesus, where does it go from there?
Oh then it starts to get so crazy this horror movie becomes a comedy. Turns out the white people have like underground lairs and are part of a secret cult.
That's crazy, we should watch that soon.
