Do you know why living in Liverpool, England was a big benefit for the Beatles.
Not really. I know it's a midsized city, but that it wasn't super cosmopolitan like London.
Exactly. On paper it seems improbable that it would have birthed a band as dynamic as The Beatles.
Yeah, why do you bring this up? Do you have a theory?
A well supported theory, actually?
Well, what is it? Why was Liverpool beneficial to The Beatles.
Liverpool was a port city and it received a lot of American blues, rockabilly, and soul records.
That makes total sense. I knew that The Beatles music was impossible without that stuff.
Yup. Their early stuff includes a lot of covers of American music.
I just had a thought, with the internet, every city is a port city in the sense of having access to culture.
