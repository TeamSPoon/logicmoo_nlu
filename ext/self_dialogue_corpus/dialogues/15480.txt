What should I sing for the talent show?
Not sure but I do know it shouldn't have a vocal track. I think that always sounds terrible.
I agree. You can never hear the singer.
I'm not even sure why the music teacher allows that.
I definitely want a song that works with my range.
That's important. You don't want to be flat or sharp.
If I can choose something will you listen to see if it's good?
Of course. We'll find a karaoke track for you to practice with and to use at the show.
We'll have to burn it to CD for the teacher to use.
Right. Maybe I'll look through Heidi's karaoke CD's.
She has a bunch since she's a karaoke DJ on the weekends. I'll get them for you.
Thanks. I wonder if she has Christina Perry.
I think she at least has that Thousand Years song.
That's the one I wanted.
I actually do think you'd sound good singing that. It is right within your range.
Didn't someone do it last year?
Yes but it wasn't good because she couldn't hit the higher notes whe she sings 'one step closer.'
I can do those notes. I do think that's the song I want.
If she doesn't have it on a karaoke CD I'm sure we can find it somewhere.
I hope so because there's no piano player.
