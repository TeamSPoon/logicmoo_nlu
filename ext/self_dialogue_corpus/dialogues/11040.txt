How old are you.
I'm as old as you are.
So you remember when hockey tried that follow the puck on tv?
I do.
Did you like it?
Not really, why?
I hear that they may bring it back.
Really, why?
They want to try it out again with better technology.
You know, it was pretty bad.
Yeah,a lot of the time the line could not follow the puck.
It did help when it worked.
That's true.
I wonder how the technology will help out.
I thinking the inserted a small chip in the puck.
Won't that throw off the balance?
Maybe, but I don't think the weight will matter.
It should.
Well we will have to see.
You'll see it does matter.
