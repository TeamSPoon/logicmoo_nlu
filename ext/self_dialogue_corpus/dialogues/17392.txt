Have you heard the song Chocolate?
Yeah, I think so. By The 1975?
Yeah! I just heard an acoustic version of it and it was so good.
It is a pretty good song.  The only problem is I can't understand what the singer is saying sometimes.
The singer is Matt Healy. I think his Manchester accent gets in the way sometimes.
Oh, is the band from Manchester?
Yeah they are.
Who are the other band members?
Matty Healy is lead vocals and rhythm guitar, Adam Hann is lead guitarist, Ross MacDonald is bassist, and George Daniel is the drummer.
Wow, you must be a huge fan if you know all the members.
I do really like them.  The first time I heard them was almost ten years ago.
How long have they been active as a band?
They've been active since 2002, so about 15 years.
Wow, that's longer than I thought! Do you have a favorite song?
Yeah, it's called The Sound.
I don't think I've ever heard that one. Why do you like it?
It just has a really peppy beat and catchy melody.
It sounds like a good song to jam out to.
It is! You should listen to it.
I will!
