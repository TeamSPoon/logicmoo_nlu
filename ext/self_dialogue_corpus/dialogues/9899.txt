Have you been hearing any rap music lately?
Yes I have been listening to Big Boi.
Awesome. What songs?
Mic Jack and Da Next Day.
On the Boomiverse album?
Yeah that is exactly right?
The only song I have is In the South.
I like that song with Gucci Mane.
They both are talented.
I always feel they are catchy.
