Have you heard about the new movie Coco that's coming out soon?
No, I haven't. What's it about?
It's about a little boy who wants to become a musician like his idol. His family has a ban on music though.
Oh! That sounds like it'll be good!
It's coming out in November 2017.
That's not too far away!
I'm excited for the movie soundtrack.
I bet it will sound amazing!
The movie is also based around Dia de los Muertos.
That's neat that they are including a Mexican holiday that many people may not know about.
