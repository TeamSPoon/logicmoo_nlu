Hey, what is your favorite bands these days?
Well, I like oldies but goodies.
What type of music is that?
Hmm, it's a mixture of a lot of music type. Just classics like rock and country.
Name me off a few bands or singers.
There is Elvis Presley, Patsy Cline, Loretta Lynn, The Beverly Brothers and Brian Hyland.
Which one of those were your favorite.
Brian Hyland, He is a real classic.
Name me off one of his songs and I'll check it out. I don't mind getting into the classics.
It's a long name and its kind of funny but it's called  Itsy Bitsy Teenie Weenie Yellow Polka-dot Bikini.
That is a long name and it sounds cute. How long ago is that song from and was it a hit back then?
I believe it was made way back in the 1960's and it was a hit, he sang that song when it was only 16.
That's awesome. Tell me about Patsy Cline.
Patsy was a real star back in the early 1950's and 60's. She was killed in a plane crash though in 1963.
That's really sad. I think my grandmother has some old vinyls of Patsy Cline.
I wouldn't be surprised. She had some amazing classics out there. I Fall to Pieces, Crazy and Walking After Midnight.
Those are some of her songs?
Yes, she has quite a few. You should listen to some of her music.
I think I will, I'm going to visit my grandmother so I'll ask her about the records when i get there.
Maybe you and her could listen to them together? that would be nice and your grandmother might like that.
