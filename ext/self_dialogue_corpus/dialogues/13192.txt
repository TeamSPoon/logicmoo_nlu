Kylo Ren's lightsaber is so weird.
What do you mean?
He's got the lightsaber beams coming out of the side.
So?  Not sure what you're getting at.
I would think that those would be in the way and you could cut your own hand off.
Maybe they're there to help protect his own hand from getting cut off.
Guess it makes sense.  That did happen to Luke.
Exactly.  Maybe that's why it was built that way.
Never thought about that.  You're a genius!
You're right, I am a genius!
