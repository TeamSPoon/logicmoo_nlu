Hey, have you ever listened to Tame Impala?
No, what is that?
It's a band actually I think they come from the UK.
Really? No I don't listen to music from the U.K too much.
Yeah, me neither, but they are becoming very popular in the U.S.
Oh really?
Yeah, they have some good songs, and honestly they remind me of the Beatles.
What do you mean?
They are really psychedelic sounding rock, and the singer sounds like Lennon a bit.
Really? That sounds kind of cool. What are some of their song names?
Elephant, going backwards, I can't think of the rest off the top of my head.
Oh O.K, I will check them out, is it good relaxation music?
Definitely, but they will take your mind on a trip, for sure.
How do you figure?
Well, the music is psychedelic rock, so it is very mellow and trippy at times, with the guitar and melodies.
That's cool though, the Beatles were like that too.
Yeah, totally, check out going backwards first, that's my favorite song by them.
O.K cool!
Message me what you think of them when you do!
Will do, thanks man!
