Disney has some amazing animated films and I think Aladdin is definitely no exception.
I absolutely agree with that. I think it falls into that category of helping launch Disney.
Did you remember if you went and saw it in the theater?
I do and in fact, my family and I went to see it several times. I think it's the movie I've seen the most times at the theater ever.
Having re-watched it not too long ago, I also think the animation holds up very well.
It definitely does, as well as the voice acting.
Absolutely agree. The late Robin Williams stole the show, however.
I think the Genie was the most popular character for a lot of people, especially the kids.
To this day, it's probably one of my top three favorite Disney movies.
It's up there for me, as well. Aladdin is a classic and there is no denying that.
