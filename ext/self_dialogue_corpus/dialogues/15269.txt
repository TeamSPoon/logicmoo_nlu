Have you heard any good music lately?
Yeah, actually I just got spotify, so I've been listening to a lot of new stuff.
Cool, I've been thinking about getting it, so what have you been listening to?
I can't stop listening to the new Kendrick Lamar album.
I've only heard one song, I think it was called Humble, is the rest of the CD good?
Yeah man!  Humble is probably my favorite but DNA is a close second.
I'm definitely going to have to listen to it.
Yeah you are, I think spotify has a free trial if you want to check it out.
Maybe I will, I think I'm just going to check it out on Youtube after we're done talking though.
Alright, but back to Kendrick, I can't stop listening to the album!
Do you think it's as good as his last album?
Well, that one was one of my favorite albums of all time, but this one is catching up to it.
Man, I know how much you love his last one, so now you've got me excited to listen to this one.
I highly recommend it, he has a song on there with Rihanna too that's really good.
Ah, I've never been a huge Rihanna fan, but I guess I'll give it a shot.
It's not one of the best songs ever, but it's still good.
Anyone else collaborate on it with him?
Well, he did a song with U2, but I'm not a huge fan of it.  You just have to listen to the whole album.
Ok, you've convinced me, I'm gonna go check it out.  Thanks man!
No problem, let me know what you think!
