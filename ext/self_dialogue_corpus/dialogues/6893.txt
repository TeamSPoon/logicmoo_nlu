I just can't believe it!
What?
They are remaking Mulan.
Oh, I haven't even seen the original to be honest.
Really?  It's really good.  You should watch it instead of the live action one.
I will check it out.  Remakes usually make me really mad.
Yeah, especially if it's really bad.  It disrespects the original.
I think it's weird to remake cartoons, but this is Disney we are talking about.
They will remake anything for the mighty dollar.
It's a shame.  Let's just hope it's good.
