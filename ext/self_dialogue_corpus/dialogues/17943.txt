Do you like Jimi Hendrix?
Yes he is the greatest guitarist that ever lived.
Shame what happened to him.
Unfortunately it happens too much with musical artists.
The lifestyle is too much temptation.
I often wondered if drugs actually help musical creativity.
It may be it seems so many artists have been victims of drug abuse.
What are your favorite songs?
I like Crosstown traffic and Manic Depression.
Those are great songs.
How many songs did he record?
More then one hundred and eighty.
Did he write them himself?
He wrote over 130 songs himself, some songs were written by others.
Any of the bigger hits written by anyone else?
Hey Joe was written by Billy Roberts?
Who is that?
He was another musician who never was as popular.
I never heard of him.
He is not well known.
