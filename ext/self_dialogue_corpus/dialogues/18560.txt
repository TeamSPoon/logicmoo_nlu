What do you think of country music nowadays?
It's not really country anymore, it's more like pop music.
When do you think it changed?
Right about the time Garth Books hit it big.
You think Garth Brooks is a pop artist?
No, he has country songs. But right about the same time is when country music changed. I think his flamboyant style attracted a lot of pop fans.
You don't think there are any genuine country artists out there?
There's a few. Toby Keith comes to mind.
You don't think his song Red Solo Cup is more pop than country?
I think that song was supposed to be a joke.
Did you listen to country back in the 1980s?
Yeah, I liked the band Alabama. Eddie Rabbitt was another favorite.
Did you have a favorite Alabama song?
Not really, they had a ton of good songs. Eighteen wheeler and Love in the First Degree were always on the radio.
What about Eddie Rabbitt? My favorite song was I Love a Rainy Night.
That was a good song. The one I remember the most was Driving My Life Away.
Have you heard Toby Keith's cover of Gordon Lightfoot's song Sundown?
I saw a live version on YouTube yesterday. It was great. What else did Gordon Lightfoot sing?
The only other song I can think of was The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald.
That song came out in 1975. To commemorate the sinking of a ship on Lake Superior.
