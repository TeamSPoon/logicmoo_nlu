Have you ever seen Heartbreak Ridge?
With Gunnery Sargent Thomas Highway, played by the Majorly awesome Clint Eastwood?
So I'll take that as a yes then.
Absolutely yes, I watched it with my dad all the time. He's a Marine too around that time period.
Whoa that's pretty cool to have a connection like that to a movie.
Well it's an amazing movie even without a connection like that.
I loved it when he would just pop up out of nowhere with an AK-47.
"an Ak-47, the preferred weapon of our enemy, it makes a very distinctive sound when fired; remember it."
Wow I thought I was the only one that remembered that.
Heck no, when Gunny tells you to remember something, you better.
Who was the guy that robbed him in the beginning?
You're talking about the Earl of Funk, the Duke of Cool, Ayatollah of rock'n'rolla; Mr. Stitch Jones.
You weren't kidding when you said you've seen it before.
Only 3 times a year since I was 5, so about 70-80.
Wow, that is just way too many.
Like I said I really like the movie.
Well anyway, I laughed so hard when Stitch tried to get Gunny beat up by Swede.
I can't help but chant with them every time, even though I know what's about to happen.
I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say that you can pretty much quote that whole movie.
Do you want them alphabetically by character's name or actor's? Or just talk straight through the script?
