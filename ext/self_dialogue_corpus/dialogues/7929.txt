Do you know Demi Lovato?
I do! She is a great singer.
I listen to her song "Confident" all of the time.
That song is great. It's super motivational.
That's why I like it so much! It really pumps me up.
I also like her song "Kingdom Come." It inspires me a lot too.
I don't listen to that one very often. But I definitely like it.
The two songs sound very similar. I thought you might.
I can't wait for her new album. I hope it has a song that sounds like "Confident"
I hope so too!
