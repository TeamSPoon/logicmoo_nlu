Do you like Van Halen?
I love Van Halen.
Really great band that doesn't play.
I know,always arguing.
When they play,it's the best.
David Lee Roth is the best.
The stuff he did onstage.
Just with the song and video jump!
Really cool video.
How about hot for teacher.
Great video too.
So was the song.
Panama another good one.
How about pretty woman.
Great cover.
Sammy Hagar had good success with them too.
Yes he did.
Right now was a big hit.
Good one for him.
He fought with them too.
