Boy, those Battlin' Bucs really took a turn toward the basement of the NL Central Again this year.
Yes, don't remind me.
They really had a chance to do something special the past 3 to 4 years and blew it.
Surprisingly, yes. I thought I would never see the day they finished over .500 again.
Same here. I'm still having flashbacks to the early 1990's.
Yes, that was a difficult time. At least one of those teams should have won the world series.
They had a chance at a World Series the past few years also, but ran into a hot pitcher at the time.
Yes, they always ended up in a one game playoff against the hot pitcher at the time.
Arietta, and then that guy from the Giants. I can't think of his name.
I know who you are talking about. He pitched a gem against them in 2014.
Oh, what's his name?
Lincecum?
No, not him.
Oh, I know. It was that Bumgartner guy.
Yes, him. He was pitching like he was Sandy Koufax or something that year.
The Giants won three world series on pitching and mediocre offense.
Yes, they are one of the worst teams I've ever seen to win a World Series.
Well, worst or not, they won the World Series.
If only the Battlin' Bucs would win one more.
Yes, that would be the day. 1979 seems so long ago. Ugh.
