Hi! What kind of movies do you like watching?
I like dramas and romantic movies. What do you like?
I like funny movies. What is your favorite movie then?
I like The Vow. It's one of the most touching romantic movies I've watched in a while.
I haven't really watched that yet, what is it about?
It's about a woman who gets in a wreck with her husband and completely looses her memory and forgets she was with him. It's a complex story but a good one, it's also a true story.
Wow! That's crazy! So did she stay with him then. That would be so odd being with someone you don't remember.
She did, and then she left, and then she came back again, in between going back to her old fiance. It was really sad for the guy.
That is very sad, I still may watch it though. Who played the characters?
I don't remember them all, but the main characters were Rachel McAdams and Channing Tatum.
Oh okay! I like movies that Rachel McAdams plays in, she's a good actress.
Yes she is, I've seen a lot of her movies. If you like funny ones, I'm sure you've seen mean girls.
Yes! That movie is so bad but so funny, she plays Regina George very well.
I know right! I still like to watch that movie as a guilty pleasure every now and then, it is so funny!
Have you watched Norbit?
Yes, it's really funny too.
I had to buy it when it came out on DVD, I've watched it so many times. That is my favorite funny movie.
I've watched it once, anything with Eddie Murphy is really entertaining.
That's another reason I love it, I watch all the movies with Eddie Murphy!
I've watched a lot with him as well.
