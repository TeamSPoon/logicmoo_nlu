Do you like ambient at all?
Somewhat, I prefer electronic ambient to the more new age ambient.
Then you should listen to Marconi Union or Brian Eno.
Should I listen to both, or just one?
I prefer Marconi Union because they incorporate jazz instrumentals into their music but Eno is great too.
I don't really like jazz that much, what about Eno?
He's more traditional ambient, some even say he founded the genre.
Really? I like musicians who are at the cutting edge.
Yeah his music is fairly experimental.
Does he use a synthesizer for everything?
Yeah, well he incorporates piano too but mostly that.
It seems like he must collaborate a lot.
Yeah he worked with Harold Budd on an album.
What does he play?
He's more of a neoclassical composer, so their music together is more like classical music.
I think I might like his music, especially the albums with Eno.
Eno has some amazing songs like Thursday Afternoon, it's a song which is literally an entire album long.
How could it be that long, is the album just really long?
No the song takes up the entire album length, it's a great piece though.
I'll listen to it then, thanks.
