Do you listen to hip-hop music?
Yeah, I like rap.
What kind of rap do you listen to? Any region or era you prefer?
I like 90s East Coast stuff
You like Smif-N-Wessun?
Yeah, Bucktown is a classic track.
Too bad they got sued by Smith & Wessun and had to change their name for a while. I think it killed their momentum.
Yeah, also Cocoa Brothaz was a weird name to replace Smif-N-Wessun with.
Did you ever listen to Black Moon? It's a lot like Smif-N-Wessun.
Of course, Enta Da Stage is a classic.
How Many MC's Must Get Dissed?
Exactly!
That whole crew had the best 90s NYC sound.
Either that or Wu-Tang.
Yeah, Wu had some great albums that capture that old New York vide.
Only Built 4 Cuban Links is so cinematic.
These days NY hip-hop just isn't as tight.
Dipset was ok for a little while in the 2000s, but no one really stands out right now.
There's probably more indie rockers in Brooklyn than rappers at this point.
Yeah, gentrification affected the culture I suppose.
