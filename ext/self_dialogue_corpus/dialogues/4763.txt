What would be the scariest bench clearing team that you could assemble?
Hmm. Let me think about that one.
Who would you pick to create an enforcer baseball team, a team of 9 players (pitcher included) that you would never want to bean with a pitch and have a bench clearing brawl against.
Stanton, machado with a bat.
I don't know.
How about Mo Vaughn?
He's like a teddy bear.
Tough crowd.
I agree about Stanton though. Just give him a bat and stay out of his way.
Exactly. How tall is he anyway?
He's 6'6".
I thought so. He just towers over everybody on the field.
Yeah but size doesn't always make someone a good fighter
True but it is great camouflage.
What do you mean?
I mean would you in your right mind pick a fight with someone who is that tall?
No way. I'd be doing my best to stay on his good side.
Exactly my point.  Not everyone will try a giant to see if he is tough or not.
You're right. Especially if that giant swings a baseball for a living.
Yep.
