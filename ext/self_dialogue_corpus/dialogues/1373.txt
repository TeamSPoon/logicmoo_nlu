Are you excited for the NFL season to begin?
Can't wait! I've been dying to watch my Packers play again!
Do you think they will make it to the super bowl this year?
I'm not sure. I know they will do well, but they have a lot of young guys on defense and have a lot of work to do to get there.
I hope the Broncos make it to the playoffs. It would be fun to watch them play the Packers in the Superbowl.
I don't mind the Broncos, but they haven't been the same since Peyton Manning left.
I agree. What do you think about their new quarterback?
I don't know much about him, but I heard that he has a lot of potential.
No one will ever be as good as Aaron Rogers, am I right?
Some people could argue with that statement, I however couldn't.
What do they call Packer fans again?
Do you mean cheeseheads?
Oh yea! That's right.
I love a good cheddar. Their fans are pretty serious.
Is Lambeau field enclosed?
No, it's an outdoor stadium. It gets incredibly cold in the winter.
Oh that's right, I've heard lots of teams hate playing there in the winter due to the cold temps. Must be really hard to catch a football when it's that cold.
Yes it is. And incredibly enough, I can't remember a single game ever getting cancelled due to being too cold.
Boy the Packers must be a pretty tough team to beat.
Yup, and I can't wait to watch them in August!
