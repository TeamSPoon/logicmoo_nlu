Do you think the lions will make the playoffs this year.?
I think they have a shot.
I'm reading a lot of 6-10 predictions.
I think with some breaks they could make a playoff run.
They would need breaks.
I like Mathew Stafford.
I think he has a good future.
They helped the offensive line.
They picked up Tj Lang and tackle Ricky Wagner.
Some have Ameer Abdullah having a breakout season.
I think they will score points.
Stafford is a smart quarterback.
His game management skills are real good.
Yes they are.
I think he'll have more time to throw the ball this year.
Yes,with the additions on the line,I agree.
I think they make the playoffs.
I think they do too.
In fact,I think they win a playoff game.
You could be right.
