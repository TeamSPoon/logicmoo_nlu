Do you like dark comedies or more lighthearted comedies?
Honestly, I like both. My favorite comedy though is Zoolander.
Is that the one with Owen Wilson and Ben Stiller?
Yeah, they're male models and it's hilarious.
"Hansel. He's so hot right now"
Haha yeah, Will Ferrell's character is great. "I invented the piano key necktie!"
It's a really great movie to quote. So many good ones.
"I think I'm catching the black lung pop. It's not very well ventilated down there."
Isn't the woman in Zoolander also Ben Stiller's wife in real life?
I've heard that, but I'm not 100% sure.
