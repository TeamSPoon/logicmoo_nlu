Hey you! Seen any good movies lately?
Haven't really had time for movies lately, but I did rent Hounds of Love the other night.
Oh? Never heard of it.
Me neither, but my friend in Australia totally recommended it. It sounds like a very promising Crime, Drama, Horror film from 2016.
I didn't know you were into crime.
Well... it's not the biggest part of this particular film par say, but I did enjoy the classic Godfather trilogy, Shawshank Redemption, and Zodiac.
Shawshank Redemption... wasn't that with Morgan Freeman?
Yup! One of my absolute favorite actors.
Mine too. His voice is just so chill... I could listen to him read a phonebook.
Same. What's your favorite Freeman film?
Well... thought he made the perfect Lucius Fox in the Nolan Batman trilogy.
Agreed. Anything else?
He was hilarious in The Lego Movie and Bruce Almighty. Gosh, there's so many films I can't just name a few.
I know! Practically all of them are great if not ALL of them.
What about yours?
The Sum of All Fears is probably my absolute favorite though just as much for Ben Affleck as Morgan.
Yeah, you've always been a huge Ben Affleck fan.
How can I not be? I absolutely fell in love with him across all of Kevin Smith's movies.
Now that's an actor and director I follow almost as religiously as Morgan Freeman.
Only almost? He's my film and comic book god practically.
