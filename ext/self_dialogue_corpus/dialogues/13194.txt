Name me someone who became famous because of Star Wars.
Sure, I can do that. Ben Burtt.
I don't recognize the name. Was he in the supporting cast?
In a way. In fact, he won an Oscar for his work.
Come on, don't keep me in suspense!
Ben Burtt was the sound effects editor. He invented all the cool sounds that we all recognize from Star Wars.
Oh, like the buzz-swish of a light saber.
And the beeps and boops of Artoo Detoo.
And the heavy mechanized breathing of Darth Vader.
Ha! I can see now why you call him a supporting player. The movie would not be the same without his work.
