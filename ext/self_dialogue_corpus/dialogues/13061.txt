So who are some of your favorite minor characters in the Star Wars films?
You mean, those kind of walk-on, wordless cameo aliens? I have a couple.
Yeah, like the guys they made action figures of but aren't really onscreen for very long.
Well, I've always been fascinated by the other bounty hunters in the lineup with Boba Fett.
You mean, at Cloud City?
Totally! I mean, we have Dengar, who is this kind of dirty, grizzled looking guy covered in bandages, with maybe mechanical limbs...
Oh yeah, and 4-LOM, who looks sort of like an evil insectoid C-3PO.
Yeah, it's such a great visual.
And Bossk, the kind of reptilian fellow in a spacesuit, who looks nasty and ravenous.
Yes! It's like, they're only onscreen for a few seconds but you want to know more about them all!
