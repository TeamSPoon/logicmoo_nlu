What is your favourite Disney movie?
I think the Lion King is my favourite.
That movie is my favourite as well but I also really enjoyed Bambi.
Bambi is such a sad movie but The Lion King is also pretty sad.
Many Disney movies have sad parts like Frozen when she accidentally hurts her sister.
Did you like the Frozen movie?
I did. It is my favourite modern Disney movie.
I don't usually enjoy the singing in Disney movies but I liked the singing in Frozen.
The singing was very good. I think it is my favourite part of the movie.
I hope the new Frozen movie has lots of great singing.
