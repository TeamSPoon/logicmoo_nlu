Would you say that Reba McEntire is the queen of country music?
She is a legend in the country genre, but there is way to much competition to call her that.
What do you mean exactly?
I just feel like it would be hard to call her that over a few other singers so easily.
She has so many awesome songs though! Have you ever heard of Fancy or Consider Me Gone?
Yes and I agree that she is great, but there are a lot of other great ones!
Who else would you put on her level?
Well just to name a few, Dolly Parton, Loretta Lynn, or how about Faith Hill?
Those three are awesome and all, but I do not think they compare with Reba!
We will just have to agree to disagree on this issue then.
Can you even name any major hits from the other three?
Of course I can! They all had several big hits, but you want me to just name one from each of them?
Sure, because I do not think that their hits are as popular as Reba's.
Wrong again! Dolly had a little song called I Will Always Love You.
I forgot that she actually sang that before Whitney Houston.
Loretta Lynn had Coal miner's daughter. That was a major hit that came out in 1970.
Yea I will concede that that is a popular song. Can not argue on that one.
Faith Hill has a song called This Kiss that you may also recognize.
I see what you are saying now, there are a lot of great women country music stars.
Yes! That is why I say it would be so hard to simply name one of them the queen of country.
