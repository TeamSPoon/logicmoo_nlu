I really like that James Arthur song, "Say You Won't Let Go."
I do too, everybody likes that song.
It's number eleven on the Billboard pop chart right now.
His voice is so mesmerizing on that song.
I was thinking about how great it would be to hear him singing it live. I checked online, and he's on tour in the US all next month.
Are there still tickets available?
There's a show in New Jersey July 25th, and there are still tickets available for $25.
We could make a road trip out of it and split the gas and expenses.
That sounds like a lot of fun. I'd love to go.
Summer is always a great time to go to a concert.
