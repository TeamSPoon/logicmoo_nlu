What's the funniest movie you've seen in recent years?
I couldn't stop laughing during '21 Jump Street.'
That's a great choice.  I didn't think Channing Tatum would be so good in a comedic role.
He's really leaned into it in recent years.  Now I see him in so many similar roles.
He and Jonah Hill were a great comedy duo.  I loved that the movie's vision of modern day high school was so accurate.
You're right.  I never liked that high school movies in the 90s and 2000s keep playing on the jock-nerd bullying trope.
Yea, no one gets stuffed in lockers anymore.
The popular kids in the movie focusing on college and grades was way more accurate in terms of our own high school experiences.
The dialogue was also perfect.
Did you like the sequel?
The sequel was fun too.  Definitely more meta than the first movie.
The end-credits sequence with the fake movie promos was my favorite part.
I loved that.  Who knew the end-credits of a movie could be that entertaining?
I don't think I laughed that much since 'Pineapple Express.'
Now THAT, was an underrated movie.
It's probably because it came out in theaters around the same time as 'Forgetting Sarah Marshall.'
Really?  That's rough, because 'Pineapple Express' was way better.
James Franco was another surprise comedic actor.
Yea, you wouldn't assume he'd be that funny because he's in such serious roles.
It demonstrates his range as an actor.
