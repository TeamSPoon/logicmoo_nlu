Hey, I finally saw Guardians of the Galaxy!
Really? What did you think?
Honestly, it wasn't my favorite of the Marvel movies,
Huh, I thought it was fun.
It certainly had a lot of exciting chase scenes.
I really liked the fight scene near the beginning, too, where everybody meets.
And I enjoyed watching them plan the jail break.
To the extent that you could call that a plan, yeah.
That was my basic problem with the movie - I thought the characters weren't very competent.
Well, they're kind of supposed to be a ragtag team.
They definitely are. But I didn't feel like they ever made good plans.
Gamora and Rocket were the smartest ones on the team.
And neither of them was the team leader.
Peter Quill always meant well, though.
I'm not saying he's not a good guy. Just not really my type.
You have to like Groot, though.
Oh, Groot is adorable!
It was so sad when he died.
But Baby Groot is incredibly cute.
I'm looking forward to seeing more of him in the second movie!
