Hello buddy, I was watching tarzan movie this morning
hey, really? me too!
What was your favorite part of the movie?
I really enjoyed when Ted asked Tarzan to get an elephant hair
It was crazy. I couldn't believe he actually went for it!.
Crazy, no?. Another scene that I really loved was when Tarzan saved Kerchak by killing the jaguar.
Oh, I really loved it as well. Tarzan was so brave!
Definitively!. I think after that, Kerchak realized that Tarzan was part of their family.
I agree with you. It is a beautiful message delivered by the movie.
Yes, it is.We need to respect and love each other no matter how different we are.
