Do you like the Wizard of Oz?
Honestly, I never really liked it.
Really?
Well, I liked when we see the witch in the window.
During the tornado?
Yeah, that's pretty much my favorite part of the whole movie.
So, you don't like the singing or the munchkins or the whole journey?
Not reallly.  I think the witch is pretty hilarious though.
Did you boo when she starts to melt?
No, but I usually didn't watch it that far.
Don't you think any of the movie is good?
Well, I do think it's pretty cool that they have digitally processed it to look good even today.
Yeah, the movie is old.
My grandmother watched it when she was a kid and she's in her eighties!
Wow, I didn't realize it was that old.
Sure, it is.
Did you watch the Great and Powerful Oz?
No, I passed on that one too.
Don't you like fantasy movies?
Not really.
