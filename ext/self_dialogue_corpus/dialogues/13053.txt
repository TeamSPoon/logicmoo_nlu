Okay, let's list our favorite battle scences in order of movie. I'll start with the Death Star fighter battle from a New Hope.
Okay, then I respond to you with the Death Star battle from Return of the Jedi
Okay, that would have been my second, so I'll have go with the main battle in Empire Strikes Back.
Yeah, that's my number two favorite as well.
My next favorite is the Battle of Geononsis in Attack of the Clones.
Yeah, that's a good one, but I'm more partial to the Battle of Courscant in Revenge of the Sith.
Who you like vehicle battles do you? What would you rate higher, the BAttle of Scarif or the battle of StarKiller Base?
I'd have to go with the battle of Scarif, more variety of vehicles and comabt types.
True, the base of Starkiller is mostly a fighter battle with Ren and Rey's saber duel inbetween.
Yeah, but it nowhere near as epic as Obi-wan and Anakin's duel on Mustafar.
