My kids broke their Frozen DVD today.
Oh no!
Yeah, it created a mini-meltdown in the house.  My daughter was in tears.
What are you going to do about it.
We bought the DVD/Bluray combo so we have a backup.
Crisis averted.
Problem is it's really scratched up.  Any ideas?
You should clean it with a wet towel to see if that helps.
You don't think it will make it worse, do you?
No worse than Elsa freezing it!
