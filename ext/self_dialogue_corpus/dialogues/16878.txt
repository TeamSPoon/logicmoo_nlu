Have you ever heard of Little Mix?
Yeah, the girl band right?
Yep, they were on the X Factor.
Were they together before hand or were they put together?
Put together, ala the other bands that have come out of X Factor.
I always liked how they randomly put 5 people together and then they become huge!
Yeah, it's always a weird twist of fate.
Well have you ever seen Little Mix?
No, I don't think they really do concerts.
Probably not, but they should.
Yeah, they would make a lot of money.
Agreed, have you heard their new song Power?
YES, I love it.
Me too, it's so catchy and I love the music video!
I think the message is amazing, girl power!
I love their voices together as well, they fit so perfectly.
Of course, the beat drop in the chorus is amazing.
Yeah, it makes me want to dance!
I even like the rapper, Stormy.
Yeah, he makes the song instead of breaking it.
