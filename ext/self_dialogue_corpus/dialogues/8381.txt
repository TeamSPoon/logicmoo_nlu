I feel like every time I turn on the TV i am hearing Katy Perry music.
Her songs are in a lot of commercials these days.
True, plus I feel like she's on the news and entertainment tv a lot.
She is, but she's a mega pop star and her tunes are really catchy.
Catchy and fun.  I still like to drive around to California Girls.
I can see you doing that. I still like Dark Horse.
I would like it more if Kanye West wasn't on it.
I like it inspite of him, he's such a leech.
Well, hopefully she wont do any more music with him.
Yeah, there are so many better artist to collaborate with these days anyway.
