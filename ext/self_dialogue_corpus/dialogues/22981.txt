Talladega Nights is really funny you ever see it?
Yes Will Ferrell is hilarious.
He was nuts running around in his underwear on the racetrack.
Yes then he thought he was paralyzed and stabbed himself in the leg.
Did you like him in Stepbrothers?
Yes I did.
I like when they were fighting on the front yard.
I liked when Will was saying he would touch the guitar set.
I liked when they sleepwalking and the poor dad got hurt.
He was pretty good in Old School too.
Yes I liked him in that also.
Did you see Deadly Adoption?
no I didn't.
I lot of people didn't like that one.
Why not?
I think they are used to Will being in funny roles and it was more serious.
I like him in funny and serious roles.
Yes me too.
I probably watched almost all Will Ferrell movies.
Yes me too. Chris Farley too.
