Do you remember Mrs. Doubtfire?
Oh, that was one of my favorite Robin Williams movies!
I loved the accent he had as Mrs. Doubtfire!
Yes, it sounded so funny when Mrs. Doubtfire was explaining how her husband was killed.
I liked that part where he didn't have his makeup.
Oh, didn't he smash his face in a pie?
Yeah, before everyone walked in.
All that to see the kids.
Why couldn't he see his kids in the first place?
I really don't remember.
