What do you think about the Fast and Furious movies?  Do you like them?
Yes I do.  I started watching the whole movies when Fast 5 came out.
Really?  I remember I liked that one, but some people criticized it.
Yeah, I loved that movie.  They drove the car off a cliff!
That was amazing.  I liked that scene too.
And then there was the part at the end when they dragged the big safe through the city streets in Brazil.
Yeah, I have a hart time understanding people who don't like that.
Haha, me too!  It was amazing and I never understand people who don't like that!
Who did you watch it with?
I watched it at the theater with a friend and his other friend, then recently I watched it with my mother.
