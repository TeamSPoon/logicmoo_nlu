The independent pop scene is getting pretty good.
So there is actually an indie-pop movement, and in the UK?
Indie-pop actually originated in the UK.
And is it pop music or alt-rock, in this case?
Indie pop actually combines alternative rock with pop.
That makes sense. The alt-rock of the late 80s and early 90s started blending in pop music elements.
Yeah, and the blending in of pop music increased over time.
I know. Early 90s bands like Pearl Jam or Alice in Chains sounded more like hard rock compared to the later alternative rock.
Going towards pop music seems like a natural evolution for rock. Pop has more mainstream appeal, anyways.
And indie groups are getting more popular. I think people are disillusioned with "rock stars"
Indie is where it's at.
How does indie-pop sound compared to alt-rock?
Well, it has less of that harsh sound and less of the angsty lyrics.
That I like. I think too much punk rock/alternative rock is about rebellion and dischord.
I know. Sometimes I just want music that makes me feel good to listen to.
I agree. That's why I like classical music: not as much downing lyrics that I don't always jive with.
Why don't you have a listen right now?
Sure. Go ahead and play it.
So how much did you enjoy the music?
It sounds really nice. It does sound like softer rock, but it has an independent and British sound that gives it flavor.
