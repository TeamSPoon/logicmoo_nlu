Lady gaga is one of my favorite people to work out to. I love the beat in some of her songs.
What is your favorite song to work out to?
I love to run to a loop of Just Dance and Edge of Glory.
Edge of Glory is very dramatic. I love the changes in it.
I used to love Paparazzi but have grown more fond of some of her other tunes. I think I played it too much.
That can happen when you use the tunes to work out to. Her songs are very motivating for me.
What do you think of her duets with Tony Bennett. I kind of like them.
I do like them. I do not play them as much as her other tunes.
I don't either but they make for good background music if you are having people over for dinner.
I can see that. Her other music is great for a dance party.
