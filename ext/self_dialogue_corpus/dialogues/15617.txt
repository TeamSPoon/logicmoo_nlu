Do you ever listen to oldies?
Oldies? Of course, they're one of my favorite styles of music!
Wow, I didn't know that about you.  What types of oldies do you like?
Mostly the old fifties doo-wop songs, but I like all types of old music.
I love the Temptations.  I think they're my favorite for old music.
Yeah, the Temptations are great, but so are The Four Tops.
Oh yeah, they're great, too.
I think that old music has a style to it that just can't be duplicated today.
No, it really can't.  Their voices were great, too.
Yeah, they really seemed to focus on the music more.  Today it's more about the production.
Yeah, a lot of music seems overproduced today.
I think they had more talent and skill back then.
I wouldn't necessarily say that, but it seems like they had to work harder.
It wasn't as easy to fix bad music with production techniques, right?
Yeah, that's exactly what I'm saying.
Well, I'll take a good oldie anyday over some of the new stuff I hear.
I tear up when I hear the Righteous Brothers.
Oh yeah, their music has always been amazing.
I think Unchained Melody is one of my favorite songs ever.
It's one of mine, too.
