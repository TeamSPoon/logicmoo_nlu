Have you seen any Disney movies recently?
Yes I saw High School musical 2.
What that a good movie?
It was alright.
Would you recommend it to me to see?
Well definitely in terms of the musical aspect.
So the music was better?
Way better. I think Zac Efron and Vanessa really grew as actors and performers in it.
Fantastic. I will make a point to see it.
Please do!
