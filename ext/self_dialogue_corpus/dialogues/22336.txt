Did you like the Alien series?
I did, and I'm excited to see the remake.
Did you see the Prometheus?  It's got tie ins to Alien
I did not know it was related to Aliens.
It's in the same "world" but at a much earlier time.  If you're an Aliens fan I definitely recommend it.
Ridley Scott has made some really good movies, that's for sure.
Agreed.  Which is your favorite?
That's hard to say, I've liked so many of them.  But if I had to pick I'd say Blade Runner.
Definitely an amazing film and a classic for sure.  I thought Harrison Ford was amazing in it.
A newer movie of his that I really liked was the Martian.
Matt Damon really brought that movie to life.  I cried when the captain finally grabbed him.
I was hoping for a happy ending but I wasn't sure.  It seemed hopeless!
Matt Damon has had a pretty good career.  I was glad his buddy Ben Affleck was able to make a comeback.
Yeah, he made some really bad movies.  I was shocked that his quality improved so much.
He started strong then I agree he had a major slump.  Argo put him back on the map.
That was a quality film, I agree.
I liked him in Gone Girl, too.  I'm not sure if that did as well in the theaters as expected.
It was such a blockbuster book, I'm not sure.  Neil Patrick Harris was an interesting character in that film.
That was quite a gory death scene.
Agree.  Rosamud Pike was terrifying!
