Have you seen Dior's new fall campaign for 2017?
No but I bet Jennifer Lawrence is in it.
You nailed it.
She has been a model for Dior for a little while now.
They say the Dior Fall 2017 collection by Maria Grazia Chiuri captures Jennifer Lawrence just as she is.
What does that mean?
She's in a series of black and white photographs that were shot by some French photographer.
How do they look?
She appears to be both elegant and relaxed in the pictures.
Like she isn't being posed.
Yeah. The clothing she is wearing in the photos are said to correspond to her own personal style.
What is she wearing in them?
Jeans, t-shirt, a dark jacket, heels, some jewelry and a Dior handbag.
It could just be me but that doesn't sound like it would be pleasing to the eye.
If the jeans she was wearing in the pictures didn't look like they belonged on a man, I would have to say you're wrong.
But... I am not wrong am I? You didn't like the clothes she was wearing did you?
No.
They should have had her wear clothes that were more feminine.
Exactly. Those pictures failed in every way to me.
That's not good.
