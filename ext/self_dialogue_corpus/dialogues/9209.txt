Hey, do you know what band I've really gotten into lately?
Which band?
My Bloody Valentine
Oh. I have heard of them but have always been deterred by the name
I totally get that, but forget the name and listen. You will not regret it.
What is their sound?
Well, they basically pioneered "shoegaze"
Oh, okay.
I don't usually like extra harsh sounding guitars, but their way of doing it along with Bilinda Butcher's soothing vocals make it all so beautiful
Man, I guess I better go check them out like right now
