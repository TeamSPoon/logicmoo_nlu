Have you scene the new Wonder Women movie
Yes I did, I thought it was really good!  What about you.
I actually thought it was the best DC movie so far. It gives me hope for the Justice League movie
I know what you mean.  DC finally got a movie right.
I mean Suicide Squad was pretty good, but Batman V Superman sucked.
You know, I liked it the first time I saw it.  Then I watched it on HBO and the more I watched it, the worse it got.
Every Marvel movie is amazing.  Each one is as good if not better than the last.
I am a bigger DC fan.  I grew up reading Superman, Flash, Justice League comics.  So it is disappointing that they have screwed it up so bad.
Superman is my favorite superhero ever.  I want there to be a great Justice League Movie.
Did you read that Josh Wheadon is doing a lot of reshoots, etc?
Yes, I did read that the other day.  Now that he is at the helm, hopefully it will be good
I know they didn't want to do everything just like Marvel, but I think they needed to build each character with their own movie first.
I know, Marvel did it perfect.  Each character got a movie, you got to know them, and then you brought them all together
I fear the Justice League movie will feel rushed.
I hope not! I hope it isn't a rushed movie.
I also can't wait for the next Thor movie.
The previews look really cool.
I love that scene where he sees the Hulk and gets excited.
I know, I laughed my butt off.
Well, we can only hope DC gets it right.
