I love cartoon movies.
Why?
It's like a long episode.
Your funny, but it's true.
Which one is your favorite?
I seem to like tv show movies.
Like the Simpson's?
Yes, and the sponge Bob movie.
Do you like Disney cartoons?
Not really.
Why?
They have lost it?
Lost what?
There movies were really good, but it just seems like theses days it too much computer cartoons.
Is any thing hand drawn?
Maybe the concept.
They should have a hand drawn cartoon.
Oh old school style.
I would watch that.
Me too.
