Do you want to go to a Atlanta Falcons game this year?
Yes. For sure.
The new stadium is going to be awesome.
I know I am so excited.
Did you ever go to a game in the dome?
Yes, I went last year. It was so much fun.
There is nothing like being at a live sporting event.
I agree, and NFL football is my favorite.
There is so much enthusiam.
Exactly. We didn't even win that game, but I still had a blast.
I completyly understand.
Yeah, just being there makes the loss seem less painful.
I will work on getting us some tickets.
That sounds great.
I will let you know some date and pricing options.
Perfect. I am up for pretty much whenever.
Great. I will check my work schedule.
I don't work weekends or nights at all.
Okay. Good to know.
Thank you.
