Who's your favorite band?
Definitely AC/DC!
They're one of mine too. Johnson or Scott?
Oh definitely Bon Scott! Johnson's good too, but Scott was classic!
I liked him best too.
Do you know who their first singer was?
Brian Johnson was first.
Nope! There was someone before him.
Really?
Yep. A guy named Dave Evans.
Wow, I never knew that!
Yea, there are some videos of him out there.
I just found one for a song called Can I Sit Next To You Girl!
Good song, but he's goofy and nowhere near as good as Scott or Johnson!
Totally goofy! It's no wonder he didn't last.
I just read where he offered to fill in for Brian Johnson when he quit.
Brian Johnson quit?
Yes, he was going deaf and his doctor told him to.
Wow that's terrible. I didn't know that.
Yea, they turned Evans down and got Axl Rose.
