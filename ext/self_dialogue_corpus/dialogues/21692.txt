Have you seen Cars 3 yet?
No, have you?
Not yet, but I'm psyched to see it.
Yes, it looks like a lot of fun.
Yeah, my kids loved the first 2 movies.
Yeah, I'm surprised after all these years that my son loves it still, but it was a chill movie!
You bet.  It is hilarious.
And it's action packed.
For a cartoon, you really feel the action.
Yeah and the graphics are cool too.
They are so colorful and inviting.
I like to see all the Pixar movies.
They sure do a great job.
I liked the Toy Story movies.
Those were so much fun not only for the kids.
They were.  I can't wait to see what's in store here.
I think that it was terrific that they keep making more Cars movies.
They sure know how to be creative.
I can't wait to see if they keep going with the series.
My grandkids probably will be watching it.
