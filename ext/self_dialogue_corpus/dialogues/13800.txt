If you could see any musician in concert, who would it be?
Hmm I'm not sure. Probably Lady Gaga.
Oh, that's a good choice! I love her.
Yeah, she's one of my favorites.
Yeah, I feel like she'd be great in concert.
I hear her shows are amazing.
Do you like her newest album?
You know not really, I'm not really a country fan. I like her older stuff.
I like Joanne, but I know a lot of people don't.
Yeah, I mean lyrically it's good, but I think it's the wrong genre. Most of her fans are into pop.
