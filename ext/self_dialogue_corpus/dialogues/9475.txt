I truly believe that Kendrick Lamar's "Good Kid, M.a.a.d. City" is the best rap album of this generation.
I've always heard good things about his music.
He deserves all the praise he gets. He's fantastic.
What are some good songs off of that album?
My personal favorite is "Sing About Me, I'm Dying of Thirst".
That sounds deep by the title alone.
It is. It's over 10 minutes long, and the flow, lyrics, and beat are all very thoughtful.
Over 10 minutes? I don't think I've ever heard of such a song.
Well, Kendrick did it, and he did it wonderfully.
I'll definitely have to check that out.
