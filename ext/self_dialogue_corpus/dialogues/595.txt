Did you see the Patriots picked up Brandin Cooks?
From the Saints?
Yeah! They're offense looks ridiculous now.
The best get better.
For real. Cooks, Gronk, Edelman, and James White. Just to name a few.
What happened to Martellus Bennett?
They let him walk to the Packers, but they picked up the Indy tight end though.
Fleener or Allen?
Dwayne Allen, that's the guy.
Dang. He was pretty solid for the Colts too.
Not even to mention the fact that Tom Brady makes everyone play better.
No names to Hall of Famers. Brady can make a receiver great.
Think any one can stand up to them in the AFC?
Honestly, I'm thinking the Raiders.
Oooooo. That's a good pick.
Marshawn coming back to an already high-powered offense? Unreal.
Derek Carr just got paid, so he's looking to ball out.
Almost forgot about Khalil Mack on D for Oakland.
Dude's a beast.
That might be the game to watch this season.
