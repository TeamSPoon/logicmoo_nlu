i just saw Batman v superman dawn of justice
awesome! what did you think of it?
it was really good! i can't believe how great it was.
is it really based on the graphic novel "The Dark Knight Returns"
they changed some elements of it but it was just as great as the graphic novel.
cool, i guess you really liked, huh?
yeah! excellent, the cast was amazing, and they all gave great performances
i forget, who were the actors in it?
there was Ben Affleck as Batman and then henry cavill as supermanl, Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor and Amy Adams as Lois Lane
who played wonder woman?
Gal Gadot, she was great as wonder woman, she stole the show towards the end of the movie
great to hear that, i liked her in the fast and the furious movies.
Zack Snyder did a good job as the director too.
another great director who had the privilege to direct a superhero movie with all these great characters. Christopher Nolan is another director who did an incredible job of that too.
you're right. by the way, did you know that Christopher Nolan and his wife where executive producers on the film?
really? what's his wife's name again?
Emma Thomas, smart and talented lady just like her husband
i bet they get along on the sets of all the movies they are involved in.
i can't wait to see the justice league. Ben Affleck, Henry Cavill and Gal Gadot are going to reprise there roles. it's going to be epic.
i bet it will, this time i'll be the one who's first in line to see the movie
