Is it football season yet?
No you got a few more months.
I cant wait I got a new fifth wheel.
Why?
I am going to every AFC East game I can?
Is your wife ok with that?
Doesn't matter does it? I am going to see my teams.
Ok the bills and patriots I get, but why the dolphins?
You forgot the jets, and because I like them.
No I didn't I just didn't want to mention them.
Josh McCown, how bout that?
Ok, hes a decent player.
Actually I can't believe they are going to bench Hackenberg.
Gee, I wonder why.
You know why, don't judge.
Look if a football player can't hold it together, he should be removed.
Why?
If they make that much money, they should atleast be playing.
You try playing football.
You try picking different teams.
