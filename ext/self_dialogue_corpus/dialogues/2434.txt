So, who is your favorite NFL coach?
Well, with no doubt it is Bill Cower.
Why is he your fav?
Watching him on the sidelines was great.
How so?
He yelled and scremed like a Northeasterner even when they were doing well.
Really?
He made me nostalgic for the Northeast.
Well, my favority was Rex Ryan.
Rex Ryan?
Yes, when he was fat.
Haha, why when he was fat?
He was more jolly then.
Jolly?
Yes, like he was having more fun.
That's funny.
He got way more serious when he lost all his weight.
Like Samson when he lost his hair?
Exactally! It was just a total 180.
Wow, i never thought of that.
