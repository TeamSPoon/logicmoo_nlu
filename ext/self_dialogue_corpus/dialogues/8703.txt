Do you like the band Guns N' Roses?
Absolutely.
They are one of my favorites.
Who is your favorite band member?
With out a doubt it is Slash.
I agree, he can really play guitar.
Have you ever seen the video for November Rain?
I have.
I like when he is playing the solo outside the church.
That is pretty awesome, I agree.
