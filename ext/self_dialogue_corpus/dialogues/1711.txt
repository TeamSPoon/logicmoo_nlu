Are you as excited as I am for the upcoming season?
Heck yeah! I miss football
I hope the Broncos do better this season
Me too, last season was a big let down
I know! especially coming off our superbowl win the previous season
Everyone doesn't think we're as good as the chiefs or raiders.
Just like how Von lost out on defensive player of the year last year.
Just because we didn't make the playoffs
We'll prove them wrong this year. Von sounds motivated losing both the sack title and defensive player of the year.
Hungry Von is best Von. Im not worried about our defense though.
Yeah they always ball out. We got a lot of questions on offense
No doubt. We definitely need to improve everything on offense
Hope who ever wins the starting qb job does good.
Yeah theres a really good battle during training camp
I guess thomas and sanders both are backing Siemian.
Really? I hope that extra year helps him out. Lynch has the better tools
Yeah I would love to see the Broncos toss bomb down field again. To stretch the field
Yeah as long as our line play is better we should be good. And a run game would help
Lets hope Anderson and Charles stay healthy
Lets hope everyone stays healthy!
