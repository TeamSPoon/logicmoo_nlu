What do you think of Toy Story?
Growing up that was always my favorite Disney movie!
Who was your favorite character?
As a kid I always wanted to be a cowboy, so obviously I really related with Woody.
I always wanted to be an astronaut so I really loved Buzz Lightyear!
I use to have the Buzz Lightyear action figure, I could never find Woody in stores.
That's because he was the star of the movie and everyone loved Woody!
Loved? Now that they have made Toy Story sequels kids still love Woody!
That's a really good point!
We should have a Toy Story marathon and relive our childhood!
