Which team has been to the most Super Bowls?
The New England Patriots
Really? How many Super Bowls have they played in?
Nine.
Nine?  I thought they won every time they played.  How many Super Bowl trophies do they have?
Five.
Only five?  How many Super Bowl trophies do the Pittsburgh Steelers have?
The Pittsburgh Steelers have Six Super Bowl trophies.
Six?  So they have more than the Patriots?
Yes, they do, even though they have not played in as many Super Bowls.
How many Super Bowls have the Steelers played in?
Eight.
So the Steelers have a better Super Bowl record than the Patriots?
That's right, probably because they're the better team.
Wait a minute. Are you saying the Steelers are better than the Patriots?
I am indeed. The facts don't lie. They have a better record in the Super Bowl, therefore they are the better team.
But don't they have to beat the Patriots to get to the Super Bowl?
That's true.
And how many times have they done that?
If you want to know the answer to that question, you'll have to look it up. I am sticking to my opinion that they are the better team.
