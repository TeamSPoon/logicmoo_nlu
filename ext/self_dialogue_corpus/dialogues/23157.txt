Have you seen the new Bridgette Jones Diary movie?
No, is that the one where she's pregnant.
Yes, She accidentally gets pregnant and doesn't know who the father is.
Oh my!  Is it between Hugh Grant's Character, & Collin Firth's.
No, Daniel is dead in the movie, but it is between Collin Firth and another cute leading man.
OH I bet that puts her in a pickle
It really does.  She spends most of the movie trying to narrow down the father search
Well she has to end up with Mr. Darcy, I'm sure.
You'll have to watch the movie.
I plan on it.  When did you see it.
I saw it on Netflix last weekend.
Oh, my favorite way to watch a movie.
I think it just came on Netflix, so it should be there a while.
Good, because I don't have much time free for the next few weekends.
I think you should make time, because it was a good movie.
I will, as soon as I can.
Rene Zellweger does a great job as Bridgette Jones.
Yes really does.  I've read the books and she really captures her essence.
I wonder if this is the last movie.
I hope not, I love them.
