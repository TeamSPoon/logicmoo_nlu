Hey are you excited for the upcoming Raiders season?
Yeah absolutely! We now have Marshawn Lynch to pick up the slack in the running game.
I can't believe he came out of retirement to come back and play for us!
I didn't think he was gonna stay idle for long, he still has some left in the tank.
I do think Beast mode will be a great compliment to the offense.
Agreed. Carr no longer has to rely solely on the passing game as he can now just hand it off.
I just hope that none of these guys get hurt and ruin the season.
We shall see, nothing we can really do to prevent that.
I just think this is finally our season. I am tired of watching a build up and then fall off from the Raiders.
Let's just hope some of the other teams in the west don't make any blockbuster moves.
Well Seattle is still really good, and you can't ever count out Russell Wilson and the Legion of Boom
Yeah they seem to always make the right moves and always stay in the playoff hunt.
Arizona Cardinals are always good too. I just don't think Carson Palmer will lead them to the promised land.
I don't think its him we need to worry about. David Johnson had an amazing season and will test teams with his style of play.
What do you think of Goff and the Rams this year?
He should have a bounceback season, but I don't think the Rams will be much of contenders this year.
Anyone else we should be worried about in our division?
Nah, not really. The niners are done for, and with Kapernick's antics, that team is doomed.
I can't wait for this season to start!
Me either. Black and silver all the way!
