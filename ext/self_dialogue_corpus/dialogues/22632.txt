Man that scene in fearless
What scene
The one where Lis whole family is killed
Oh that one was rough
It broke my heart
it was just so sad
but he got better for it
He eventually got revenge at least
But does that really help him
What do you mean
It does not bring his family back
I mean i guess you are right
Yeah the movie is just sad all around
It is one of the sadder movies
But at the same time it is action packed
Easily it is
I want to watch it again
Same
Why do we not just put it on
Lets do
