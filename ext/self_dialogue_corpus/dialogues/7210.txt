What is your favorite Disney movie?
I love the Lion King. Have you ever seen it?
Yes, I love that movie too. Who is your favorite character?
Simba, of course. I also loved Timone and Pumba.
Who doesn't? Those two are hilarious.
I was always so afraid of Mufasa. He is a scary character.
I know! He was very scary in the movie.
I always thought lions were scary like Mufasa but it was good to learn they can be nice like Nala and Simba.
Lions became my favorite animal after that movie.
I can understand why!
