How about those Cavaliers?
Yeah theyve looked good. But its really LeBron and some other guys.
True, I dont think theyd win a game without him.
Look at what happened when he left.
He has to get bored of all this winning.
He wont ever top MJ so I am surprised he isnt enjoying his money.
He loves the game clearly.
We dont know that, money is a motivator.
He will never live to see half of what he got 8 years ago.
I think he will. They live lavishly.
Well they wont stop the Warriors.
You never know. Durant is small in big games.
Yeah but Green and Curry can hide that.
Yeah they dont need to be good at the same time.
LeBron probably retires after next year.
Or he could hang on like Kobe.
I think Kobe is the reason he goes out on top.
Not sure, he could sign with LA just to win a couple more.
If he isnt in the Finals every year he wont go to the team.
Thats outside circumstances that could effect that though.
