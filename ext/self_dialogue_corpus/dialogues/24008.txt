Whata are you up to this weekend?
Nothing in patticular, why?
Wanna see a movie?
Cool, sounds fun! What did you have in mind?
I was thinking of seeing the new wonder woman movie.
Yeah I'm defintiely in, I've heard it's supposed to be good!
Yeah I'm super excited.
That's the first super hero movie directed by a female!
Well that explains why it's so filled with girl power!
Cool, I'm glad you're down! I'll look at ticket prices online.
There's a theater by my house that has cheap matinees.
That's a good idea.
Wanna meet up there on Saturday around noon?
Does the movie start around that time?
I'm not sure, but if it doesn't start for a while we can grab something to eat.
Sounds great!
Yeah, see you Saturday!
Sounds good!
I'll buy us some popcorn.
Great! I'll sneak in some snacks too.
