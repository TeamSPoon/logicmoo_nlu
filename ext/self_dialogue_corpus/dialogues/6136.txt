Seen any Disney movies recently?
I saw Ice Princess.
Isn't Kim Cattral in that?
Yes she is. Michelle T is in it as well.
What is that movie about again?
It is about a girl who wants to make it to the Olympics.
Oh interesting. But doesn't she not know how to skate initially.
Yeah she does not know how but she learns.
Sounds idealistic.
Yeah it is definitely unrealistic.
