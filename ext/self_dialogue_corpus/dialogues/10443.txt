Hey remember the Finding Nemo movie? The one with the fish?
Yeah, it's an old movie. I remember watching that as a kid. It's a good one, though.
Yeah, well. They made a Finding DORY movie.
Finding Dory? About the blue fish that has bad memory?
Yes! Let's go see it tonight!
I can't tonight, let's go tomorrow.
I am such a Star Wars fan. I want to go see the new Star War's movie!
I kind of want to see it too. I heard the graphics are simply amazing.
Cool, let's buy some tickets for tomorrow night and we can go see it together.
That sounds like a great plan! Be ready at 4.
Do you know any good movies playing for kids right now? My nephew's birthday is this weekend!
Movies for kids? Well, Zootopia is a great movie for kids.
Zootopia huh? I heard some good things about that movie. Do you think my nephew would like to see it?
Oh yes definitely! Even Shakira plays in that movie!
Really? Well, I guess I know what I'm going to do for his birthday now!
My girlfriend wants to go to the movies for our anniversary.
Oh? That sounds like fun! What are you guys gonna see?
That's the problem! I have no idea!
Well she likes the super hero movies right? Why not take her to go see Ant Man?
She might like that. I'll probably end up seeing it with her. I'll let you know what I decide on, okay? Thanks for the help!
