Are you old enough to remember the Beatles?
I've heard of them, but they were before my time.
Do you know any of their songs?
Yes, I've heard "Hey Jude" many times.
That's just one of many hit songs they performed.
Did they write their own music and lyrics?
Yes, John Lennon and Paul McCartney were very prolific composers.
Yes, it's coming back to me; I think I've heard a lot of their songs.
The Beatles are considered the most influential rock band of all time.
You're making me want to buy some of their music.
You should because their music is technically unique and really inspiring!
Do you have a suggestion for which album I should buy?
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band is considered one of the all-time great rock albums.
What are some of the songs on that album?
In addition to the title song, there's "A Day in the Life", "Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds", and "Strawberry Fields."
Didn't that second one have something to do with drugs?
No, that's just a popular myth.
I'm going to get on Itunes and download that album right now.
Great choice--let me know what you think of it!
I will.  Thanks for the suggestion!
