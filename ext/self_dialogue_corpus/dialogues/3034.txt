Which part of the country do you think has the best NFL teams?
I think the East zone does.
You're from the East coast so you may be a bit biased.
What zone do you think is better than the East?
The West has some big teams such as the Seattle Seahawks and the San Francisco 49ers.
Yes, but notice those teams are only teams in the National Football Conference. The east coast has great teams in both the National Football Conference and the American Football Conference
Go on, I'm waiting to hear you name them
First of all, we've got one of the biggest rivalries: the New York Jets and the New England Patriots.
True, both of them are great. Are those in the American Football Conference?
Yes, they are. So is the Dolphins who count as an East zone team, not a south team.
I actually assumed they were South.
Yes, I've heard people make that mistake.
What teams are on the East National Football Conference?
The Giants, the DC Redskins, the Philly Eagles, and another team people often think are the south - the Dallas Cowboys.
That's a lot of star power. Maybe you're right that the East has the best teams.
In your defense, the west is really catching up. There are many teams all of the country in fact that are far more high quality now than they used to be back in the day.
Yes of course, top teams change over time.
Just like the players, no team can be on top of their game forever.
I don't care who's on top. I am dedicated fan and I will always support the same team I always have since I was a kid.
Same here. That's called NFL loyalty!
