They are going to be making a show about Cruella De Vil before 101 Dalmations starring Emma Stone.
I can't wait to see that. Is it like a pre-quel to the shows.
I think so. It is not being released for a year or two but I always liked the live action one with Glenn Close.
Yes and Jasper and Horace were so funny.
Yes and Hugh Laurie was so funny as Jasper. A lot different than his character on House.
It showed a side to his acting abilities that are unbelievable. And Glenn Close is always a number one hitmaker.
Do you think Emma Stone will be able to play Cruella as well as Glenn Close did?
Will have to see but I can't wait to see how the puppies outwit her.
Yes, no matter how close she came to getting her spotted coat, it always ends in chaos for her.
The villain never wins in a Disney show.
