Do you want to join my fantasy football league?
Of course. I'm excited about the new season. Can't wait
Ok, I'll send you the details via email. I can't wait for the season to start either.
I'll be going to training camp to watch Tom Brady practice with Brandin Cooks
That team is off the charts this year.
I know. I'm really excited. I might draft Brady in Round 1
Haha. You are such a homer.
You'll regret saying that when he puts up 50 points every week.
Yea, we'll see about that.
Brady is going to be legit.
You really think so at his age?
Dude, he didn't show any signs of slippage last year. He's playing like he's 30
I think Rodgers is the better bet at QB. He always is for fantasy purposes
Maybe. He does have Martellus Bennett this year. Would be a great superbowl matchup with the Patriots
Is that your prediction for this year's superbowl? Pack vs. Patriots?
Ummm, yea I think so. Falcons will have Superbowl loss hangover.
I agree with you. AFC has no contenders to match the Patriots. They just got better and unless injuries hit, they should be good to go.
Yep. If Gronk is healthy in the playoffs, game over for everyone else.
It would be a good game. Rodgers vs. Brady
I can't even imagine what people would say if Brady beat Rodgers. There would have to be no more doubt from anyone whatsoever.
