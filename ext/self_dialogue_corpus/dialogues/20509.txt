Have you seen Fifty Shades Darker yet?
No, I haven't, is it good?
It is a great movie! The Jamie Dornan really captures the character of Christian Grey.
Who plays the role of Anastasia?
Dakota Johnson plays Miss Anastasia Steele.
Isn't the movie quite racy?
There are a few scenes, but the love story behind it all is the best one I have ever seen.
I absolutely love romance movies.
I think you would really like Fifty Shades Darker then, the way Christian Grey stares at Anastasia takes my breath away.
Really? How does he stare at her?
Like he has never saw a more beautiful woman in all his life. His gaze says I want you for the rest of my life.
He sounds so dreamy. I bet Anastasia falls head over heels for him.
Anastasia does fall for him deeply, but she does keep him on his toes. She doesn't give in to his every request.
Really? How does she keep him on his toes?
Christian proposes to her, and she doesn't answer him right away.
Wow, talk about keeping him guessing.
Yes, she buys a keychain that lights up with the word yes as a birthday gift for him.
That has to be the best birthday gift to recieve.
I agree, he is elated when he recieves her answer. There is much more to this movie, but I don't want to spoil it for you.
Well, it is decided then, I need to see this movie.
