Here we go.  Have you ever heard of the band Phish?
Yes, and ew that's gross.
I know, I know.  This band is notorious for being prejudged.
It's just that their fans are so weird.
Yes, I actually am very annoyed at their concerts when dealing with certain people.
Then why do you even like them?
Because every second of it is incredible and worth the trouble.
What in the world is so good about them?
It's the excitement that is derived from their approach from playing.
What is so special about their approach?
Well most bands come out and play the songs the same way each night they perform, correct?
Yeah, and where are we going with this?
Well, Phish does have rehearsed sections, which are still loose.
Yeah, those folks are loose alright.
And then there are open sections for improv.
How does that work?
Well, there's a chord structure, underlying rhythm patterns and a melody from the rehearsed section of the song.
And with those elements, a story is told?
Exactly, but the story is created right in front of you.
Wow, I get it.  I think I see the light.
