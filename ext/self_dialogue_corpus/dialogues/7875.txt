Did it ever bother you how whiny Harry is in the fifth book?
Yes, immensely.
He is a teenager, though, and puberty does have that effect.
He spends the whole book complaining and trying to thwart the rules.
If Dumbledore had explained to him, he probably would have understood.
Can a teenager really understand reason?
If anyone could, it would be Harry.
I don't think Sirius helped, though.
He wasn't a very good example, and I think he paid for it with his life.
That was brutal, but an apt metaphor for the horrible things that happen to people for no good reason.
