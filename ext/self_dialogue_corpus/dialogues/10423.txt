Howdy. What's up?
Not much. Just hanging around my house.
I was thinking of renting some videos.
What kind?
Just some old movies. Want to come over?
Yeah, I could do that.
I'm getting some black and white movies, if that's ok.
That sounds terrific. Which ones?
I planned on getting "Casablanca" and maybe another one like that.
That's a great start.
I like Bogart, so maybe I'll get another one of his.
Bogart was awesome, but I don't know many of his movies.
Well, he's got plenty of them.
Like what?
There's some detective movies of his, like "The Big Sleep" and "The Maltese Falcon."
Oh yeah, I saw "The Maltese Falcon." It was great.
Have you seen "The Big Sleep" yet? I could get that one.
No, I haven't. Sounds like a good one to get.
Ok, I'll get "Casablanca" and "The Big Sleep."  Meet me at my house at 7:00 tonight?
Perfect. See you then.
