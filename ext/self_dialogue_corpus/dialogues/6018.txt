Who is your favorite Disney Character?
I always loved Goofy.
Did you see the goofy movie in the 90s?
A Goofy movie from 1995 was a great favorite of mine.
Max was such a good character.
It did tend to focus more on him than Goofy , but still so good.
I also liked the sidekick friend.P.J. Pete
Pete the father is such a good villain type character.
I feel like in these they made him a little nicer than disney's old cartoons.
Well the original cartoons were less developed in general.
