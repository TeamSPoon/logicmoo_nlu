Did you hear the songs from Moana?
I just downloaded the soundtrack!
Me too! I love the song where Moana's dad is telling her that the island provides everything they could ever need.
I like that one too!
Did you see the movie too or just hear the songs?
I saw the movie! What was your favorite part?
When Moana collected shells in the ocean when she was a little girl, I loved that part!
Yeah me too! And then the ocean took her back to the beach so her dad wouldn't find out.
That part was really cute.
I wish I had a connection to the ocean like that!
