What are your thoughts on the kids movie The Secret Life of Pets?
Never seen it.  How is it?
It's actually incredible.  First of all, animation today is mind-blowing.
Absolutely. I agree.
On top of that there are actually some great actors in it too!
Oh yeah, like who?
There are several comedians in the film including Kevin Hart.
That's crazy.  What does Kevin Hart play?
He plays a furry white rabbit actually.
Wow, I've got to see that.
And Louis C.K. is one of the main characters.
How does he do?
He actually translates well to the animated screen.
Obviously he can't tell his jokes?
No he can't, but he does still exhibit that same personality.
Do you think that there will be a sequel?
I would bet there will be.  It seems to have been really successful.
Did your kid enjoy the film?
She sure did.  It's her favorite.
That's great.
