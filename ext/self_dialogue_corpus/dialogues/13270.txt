The best movie was Empire Strikes back for sure.
Agree, it brought so much depth to the franchise.
Don't forget the epic cliffhanger at the end.
And the reveal of Vader being Luke's father.
Yoda was epic as well, brought understanding to the Jedi order.
Yoda was maybe the best part.  His wisdom is parallel.
It amazes me that even today those special effects are still relevant.
And don't forget how the movie has held up for generations.
Yes, my daughter and I have seen them and she loves them.
Good taste taught to your daughter you have.
