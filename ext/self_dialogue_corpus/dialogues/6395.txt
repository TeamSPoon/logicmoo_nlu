I just downloaded the Mulan soundtrack on my phone and I'm so excited!
Gosh, I haven't heard that music in forever!
Neither had I, until I babysat my neighbor's daughter. We watched the movie and now I can't stop singing it!
The dragon was my favorite, what was his name?
Mushu! He was so funny!
That's the one! "Dishonor on you, dishonor on your cow!"
I'm going on a road trip with my sisters and I thought that the soundtrack would be great for driving music!
It totally would! You guys are gonna be singing your hearts out the whole drive!
My favorite song is "Reflection," even though it's kind of sad. How about you?
I like "I'll make a man out of you!"
