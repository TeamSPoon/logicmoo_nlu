I loved listening to the Beatles when I was younger.
Me, too.  What was your favorite song?
Oh man.... are we talking early Beatles or adult Beatles?
Both!  What about Sargeant Pepper era?
Uh no.  I'm not counting the Sargeant Pepper era!
I'd say Dol You Want to Know a Secret was my favorite early Beatles.
Oh yeah, that's a good one.  I liked that too.
Adult Beatles is harder because they did solo stuff as well.
Yep.  Sometimes it's hard to know if you're listening to a solo record or not.
Agree.  They were all so talented though, it doesn't matter.
