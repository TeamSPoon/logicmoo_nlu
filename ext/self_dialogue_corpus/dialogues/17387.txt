morning, what are you listening to?
I am getting ready to go for a run, so I am listening to Nickelback
Oh they are awesome, whats your favorite from them?
I love every song they ever made, but I think" How you remind me " is my favorite
I love that one, I think far away is mine
I first heard them on the spiderman soundtrack
Oh I forgot they were on that
I saw the video and was like oh wow, made my neck have chills
I think the lead singer is good looking as well
well that is a bonus yes
do you like rock music?
some, I have to be in the mood for it
My favorite is alternative and country
those are very different
I love most music, everything from Josh Groban to Maralyn manson
wow, you really do like a wide variety
music is a feeling, sometimes you want chill, sometimes you want to get moving
Like when your going for a run
exactly
I will let you get to it, have fun
