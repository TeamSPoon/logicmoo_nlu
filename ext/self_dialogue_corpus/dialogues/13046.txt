Hey, do you remember Jabba the Hutt's palace?
The one from Return of the Jedi?
Yeah, where they were using Han Solo as a decoration.
Yes, I remember it.  What about it?
Why do you think Jabba built it there?  The planet is a desert, and he is basically a giant slug.
You think he would have liked a wet planet better?
Wouldn't that make more sense?
I don't know, he was a gangster, and the Empire seemed to ignore Tattoine.
You think he was basically using it as a low key hideout?
Maybe.  Might make for a nice spinoff movie.  How did Jabba end up there in the first place?
