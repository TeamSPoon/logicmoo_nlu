I just watched Remeber the Titans for the first time last night.
You hadn't seen it?
No.
You been living under a rock?!
Just missed it. The wife said I should watch it.
Denzel was so good in it.
He's always good.
I also liked that bigger fellow.
The one from My Name is Earl.
Yeah, he was pretty good.
