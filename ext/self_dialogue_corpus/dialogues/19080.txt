What do you think of the new Katy Perry album?
Witness? It's okay.
Yeah, I can't tell what I think about it one way or another.
I didn't like the lead single too much when it first came out, but it grew on me. And the other 2 are pretty good as well.
Yeah, I like them, but something feels a bit odd about the whole thing.
I agree. It almost feels like she's trying a little bit too hard.
Well she certainly is trying. I don't think there's a single TV show left that she hasn't been on to try and promote it.
Yeah, I saw her on a couple.
I even saw her on Gordon Ramsay's The F Word the other day. It was a cute bit, but seemed a little bit of an odd place to go.
It does kind of make me root for her to succeed a little bit more though.
Yeah, I can see that.
After getting out there to promote it so heavily, it would be a shame if it just totally bombed.
Well, if it does, it won't be for like of trying.
At least not as far as promotion goes.
Yeah, perhaps if they had tried to make the album a bit better.
She certainly has it in her. The last couple were pretty consistently good.
Yeah. Maybe producers don't want to work with her as much now that she's older?
It could be.
That would suck.
It certainly would.
