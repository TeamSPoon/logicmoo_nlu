Do you enjoy the music of Billy Joel?
I do like Billy Joel a lot.
I have tickets to see him at Fenway park this summer.
That sounds really fun.
I have gone to the show for the past four years and it is amazing.
I have never been to a concert at Fenway.
Would you like to join me?
That would be great.
What is your favorite Billy Joel song?
I really like The Piano Man.
I like a less popular song called The Stranger.
I haven't heard that song.
You should download some of his music before the show.
I definitely will, which other songs do you recommend.
I really like Only the Good Die Young and Uptown Girl.
OK I will download both of them now.
Let me know what you think of them after you listen to them.
I definitely will.
Can't wait to see the show, glad you are going with me.
Me too, thanks so much for asking.
