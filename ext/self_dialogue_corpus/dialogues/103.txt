So who is the best Batman of all time?
Hmmm, let me think about it...maybe Christian Bale?
Really, my favorite was Adam West.
Dude that is old. How can you say that? He made Batman goofy.
Not goofy, cool in a different way....retro think 1960's.
Yeah, but Batman isn't supposed to dance or be silly.
But if you think about it Adam West still played it cool.
Yeah, Ben Affleck couldn't do that unless you wanted a douchy Batman.
Definitley my least favorite.
Next to George Clooney....who was awful.
