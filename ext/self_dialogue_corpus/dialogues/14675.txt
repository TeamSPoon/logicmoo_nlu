Will the NBA opt out of their deal with ESPN?
They dont care if people arent watching, as long as they keep getting the money deal.
Yeah but dont they want to grow the product?
I think the NBA is getting a good amount of viewership. They dont need to switch networks.
Will one of the other channels bid do you think?
I could see FS1 making a play for weekend games or something.
What about NBCSN?
No they have hockey and thats it.
Yeah dont they want to expand?
I dont think they are as focused on that.
Why do you say that?
They make money off of cable TV and internet, this is more of a retail thing they just need to do.
That sound stupid, look at how much money football brings in.
Yeah but basketball wont be able to get to that level
I dont agree with that, its definitely possible.
Not with how quickly teams go up and down
Thats not true every league has teams that go on runs
I just dont see your viewpoint thats all.
I think in 10 years we will see sports as dominant again and the NBA will be part of that.
Not saying much thats a guarantee
