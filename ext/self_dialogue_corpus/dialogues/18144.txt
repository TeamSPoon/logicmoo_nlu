Do you like that song "Applause" by Lady Gaga?
Which one is that? How does it go?
"I live for the applause, applause, applause. I live for the applause-plause..."
No, I don't think I've heard it.
It is a really good song.
I'll look it up. Do you have any other suggestions?
Look up "My House" by Flo Rida.
I have heard that one, actually.
What do you think of it?
It is very catchy, but I don't know if it's my cup of tea.
What do you mean?
Well it's just that Flo Rida is a cheesy pop artist.
"My House" is very much a musical masterpiece as much as it is a commercial hit.
There must be something I'm missing, then.
When you get the chance, listen to it again. This time, let the song change you.
That sounds a little dramatic.
You have no idea how much idea I love this song.
Do you have any other suggestions?
How about "My Confessions" by Usher?
Now I know you're joking!
