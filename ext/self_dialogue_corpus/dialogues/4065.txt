What is your favorite old Thriller movie?
I would say it's "the Birds" by Hitcock.
That's a GREAT one!  Hitchock was really the king of thrillers, don't you think?
Totally agree.  Do you like any of the more recent thrillers?
I loved Shutter Island with DiCaprio
That's one of my favorites. I can't believe the ending, can you?
I think that one bothered me for days.  DAYS.
I don't think there are as many thriller movies as there used to be, do you?
I guess the thriller movie genre is not always as easily defined as some of the other types
I think that the film companies don't know how to market them.
