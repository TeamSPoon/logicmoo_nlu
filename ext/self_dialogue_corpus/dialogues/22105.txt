Have you seen the Lion King?
Yes, when i was younger.
I saw it again last week. I cried.
I would too.
I balled when Mufasa was killed.
It is so sad when Simba finds him.
I know. I hated Scar.
That is the saddest part of any movie.
It's all apart of the circle of life.
Now that song is in my head.
Me too. I laughed at Timon and Pumba.
They are hilarious.
Who voiced Simba?
I think it was Johnathan Taylor Thomas.
Oh yeah. I like the fight scene at the end.
I was ready for Scar to go down.
That baboon knew serious  karate.
That was funny.
It is a classic Disney movie.
I agree.
