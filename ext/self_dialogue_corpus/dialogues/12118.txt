Christopher Lee was the best Sith, hands down.
Oh, I agree.  I wish he had more screen time.
Too bad they can't CGI him into the new movies.
I'm sure they can, but really, it's not a good idea to try.  He was an amazing actor, no point in watering him down, you know. CGI couldn't cut it
Perhaps when hwe discover a way to resurrect the dead, we can have a Dooku prequel movie.
I'd love to see a Dooku prequel movie.
He's such a facinating character. A Jedi and a nobleman, who was seduced by Palpatine. And an elegant fighter.
The switch from beating Obi-Wan and Anakin at the same time to being curbstomped by Anakin was a bit jarring.
It was to show how much Anakin had grown in power and skill.
Still, the fight could have been a bit longer.
