What do you think about the Raiders?
I'm so pumped they're moving soon!
Yeah, but I think that's still a few years away.
Two if I remember correctly.
Aren't they building a brand new stadium?
Yep, it's going to be off the strip I think.
Right, just off the big freeway that runs through Vegas.
I just think it's cool that we'll have a sports team within a two hour drive from here.
If anything, it will be good to see fans be able to travel to their games in a more affordable fashion.
Yep, so glad the owners approved their move.
Funny thing is Oakland deserves better.  They were pretty good last year.
Yeah, Carr may have been the most improved player in the league.
Him getting hurt was a killer for them.
Their offense totally dropped off with him out.
They didn't do jack in the playoffs because of it.
Which is disappointing as they could have competed with the Patriots
I love Mack on their defense.  Just a force off the edge.
He's probably a top five edge rusher in my opinion.
Top five?  Gotta be higher than that.
He might be top two or three, but there's tons of quality at that position.
