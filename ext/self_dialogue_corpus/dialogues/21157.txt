Are you excited about the new Despicable Me movie?
Yes!! I loved the first two!
Steve Carell is awesome as the voice of Gru.
Yes, that role was a perfect fit for him.
Kristen Wiig is pretty good as Lucy as well.
Yes, she has the perfect warmth and character.
Do you think the new one will be as good as the first two?
I hope so; the trailer looks pretty cute.
Yeah, I saw it on Facebook last night, and I was definitely interested.
When is it supposed to open?
I'm not sure, maybe sometime in June?
Are there any other good movies coming out this summer?
I think the Captain Underpants movie comes out n June also.
That should be awesome!  I love that series!
Yeah, I remember reading those books a few times.
It is supposed to have some good celebrity voices, too.
Isn't Kevin Hart doing one of the characters?
I think so.  And so is Ed Helms.
That should be really funny.
I know; I can't wait.
