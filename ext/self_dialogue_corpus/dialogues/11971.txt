What about the prequels, which one was your favorite?
I guess the 3rd one; I forgot what it's called.
Why that one?
Because it was dark and had some tense moments.
What was wrong with the other 2 prequels.
Come on seriously. What about the slap stick comedy with Jar Jar and what not.
Yeah but I think it was because they were targeting kids to become fans.
Yeah but still, kids can appreciate a Star Wars movie without all of the silliness.
I guess that's true; I think that's what appealed about the original trilogy.
Yep absolutely!
