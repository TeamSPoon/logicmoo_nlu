I want to watch something funny!
You should check out the movie Life.
Never heard of that one. Who is in it?
It stars Eddie Murphy and Martin Lawrence .
Then it must be really funny!
Yes it is! They are both great in it.
I will have to get that one then.
Please do, just be prepared  to laugh!
Is there a lot of cussing in it?
Yes there is. Please do not watch it around children !
