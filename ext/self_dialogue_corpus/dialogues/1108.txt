I really think Tom Brady is going to win.
Perhaps I should agree. He is old but he is experienced.
He has a lot of energy for an old guy.
I agree.
So, are you going to watch the game with your family?
No, I do not think so.  My family members are not into footballs.
If you like, you can come to my house.
Who are coming?
Some friends from work.
I have to consult with my spouse.
Your spouse is invited too.
Thank you very much.  I will tell her.
What do you think about the new Seahawks' QB?
Who is he?
His name is Austin Davis.
He used to play for Denver Broncos, right?
Yes, during the 2016 season.
I heard of him, but not very much.
Anyway, let me know if you would like to come to my place for the game.
I will talk to my wife this evening.  I will let you know tomorrow.  Thanks again for the invitation.
