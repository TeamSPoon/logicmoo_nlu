Did you ever watch Captain America:Civil War?
Yes, I did!  I couldn't believe that the Captain and Iron Man fought each other!
Personally, I was on Team Iron Man. How about you?
Oh, definitely!  Captain America got a little evil there at the end.
Didn't he let his friend almost rip Tony's heart thing out?
I think so and then took his friend's side of Tony's.  That was just way wrong.
I used to like Captain America but now I am not so sure.
Me either.  I hope they make another movie where Iron Man kicks his butt!
I totally agree with that!  Iron Man needs to wipe the floor with him and teach him a serious lesson about right and wrong!
And a lesson about loyalty and friendship!
