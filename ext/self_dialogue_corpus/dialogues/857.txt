Hey do you think anyone is going to challenge the PAtriots for the AFC crown?
Yes the Pittsburgh Steelers will be there again.
The Patriots have the Steelers number though.
True, but what does Brady have left to accomplish? Boredom might catch up at this point, and he is getting older.
They say thay every year about him...
True but every year he does get older.
I still dont see it, back to the superbowl with them.
Who will be going from the NFC?
The falcons will be back, they are going to be around for awhile.
Think they will recover from that disatourus 2nd half of the suoerbowl?
Yes, it will make them stronger and more determined.
Wll they were outplaying the Patriots for the first half, so all they need is that finish them mentality.
Agreed, killer instinct like the Patriots have.
do you think it will be a breeze for both teams
No  there is always some random team that surprises people.
In the NFC I like Tampa Bay's chances to be that team,
Good choice, yung up and coming team that showed flashes last year
What about the Bills?
What about the Bills?
LOL
