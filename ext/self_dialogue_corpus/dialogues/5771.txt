Are you a Disney movie fan?
Yes! My favorite Disney movie is Moana.
That's so funny - that's actually my favorite movie too!
Heihei the chicken is my favorite character - I love when he's hiding in the boat.
The scene right before it was scary for me. I didn't like it when it was so stormy.
Me too! I wasn't sure if she was going to make it, but good thing Maui was there.
Maui's tattoos were awesome - I loved how they kept dancing around his body.
Oh! I also loved when they would push him to do something, like be nice to Moana.
The music was also so beautiful and catchy.
I keep singing the song "How Far I'll Go" and it gets stuck in my head!
