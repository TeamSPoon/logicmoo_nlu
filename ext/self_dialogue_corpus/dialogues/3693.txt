Have you seen the movie 'Psycho?'
I've heard a lot about it, but I've never watched it.
You should see it because it is a classic.
What's so good about it?
I would say that Anthony Perkins is great in it, and the surprise ending is a shocker.
I've seen other Hitchcock movies, and they are usually pretty good.
Yes, he creates a lot of suspense within the motel.
Is anybody else in it?
Janet Leigh, who is Jamie Lee Curtis' mom, is very beautiful as the victim.
Oh yeah, I've seen some things written about her famous scene.
