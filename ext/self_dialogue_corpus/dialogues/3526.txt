What's your favorite scary movie?
I love scream, what about you?
I think I like the Halloween series the best?
Yeah, that's a good one.
Mike Meyers has creeped me out since I was a kid.
A dude in mask with a knife is scary.
I know, right?!
I think they're similar don't you?
Scream and Halloween?
Yes.
