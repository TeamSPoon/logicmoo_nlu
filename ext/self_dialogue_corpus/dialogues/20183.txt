Have you ever watched any Indiana Jones movies?
Yes I have, they're great.
Which one is your favorite?
My favorite is the last crusade.
Why do you like that one?
I like the acting by Harrison Ford and Sean Connery.
My favorite is Raiders of the Lost Ark.
Why do you like that one best?
I like how the story revolved around the Ark of the Covenant.
Yeah, that was cool.
What did you think about Temple of Doom?
I thought that one was the worst of the Indiana Jones movies.
Why did you think it was the worst.
It just had too many cheesy moments and the acting was weak.
It would be cool to see Harrison Ford make another Indiana Jones movie.
I agree he plays the character well.
What did you think about Kingdom of the Crystal Skull?
I thought it was okay. It did have good action scenes.
Maybe we should watch one today!
Yeah, let's watch The Last Crusade.
