What is the biggest problem the NBA faces today?
The lack of time players spend in college.
You dont think its arrests?
I cant remember the last time players got arrested.
OK so back to the college thing, what can they do?
Its tough to come up with a resolution
Do you think they limit how young they can be?
I think its already at 19.
So be like the NFL and make them do 3 years in college.
I think this would be the best bet for the league.
Players wont want to go overseas for that long.
Then the college game is geting even better.
It would build rivalries in NCAA again.
I think they always still exist.
Right but we havent seen a Bird/Magic rivalry in 40 years.
And I dont know if we ever see that again.
Will the players come out better?
I think with that kind of seasoning, yes.
Who would argue against it?
Players union definitely would not.
