I just saw Frozen.
Did you like it?
Not even a little bit.
What! It was one of the most successful Disney movies ever.
Yes, but it was also boring.
You did not even like Sven?
I did not like the little snowman person.
He was so cute!
The movie made no sense, why did she not just wear gloves the whole time.
She was a kid, she did not know any better.
