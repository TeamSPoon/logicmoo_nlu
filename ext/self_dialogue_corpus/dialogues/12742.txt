Which Star Wars alien do you like best?
I mean, I've always liked Chewbacca.
I do too. What is he again?
He's a Wookie. At least I think that's what they're called.
Oh yeah, Wookies! I think I like Yoda better though.
Yoda was really cool in Empire Strikes Back.
I always thought he might have been made a little too cuddly though.
His scenes in the prequels make up for that.
Yeah, he really comes into his own there.
It's great to watch.
