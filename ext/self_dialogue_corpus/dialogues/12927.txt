Who is your favorite Star Wars character?
It would have to be Han Solo
And why is that?
Because he was a cool friend and a cool ship, and he gets the girl.
Okay, I can seen why you like him.
WHo's your favorite character?
Darth Vader, no contest
I can probably guess why, but tell me anyway.
Because he has all those cool powers and he is just a great bad guy.
I kind of thought it was like that.
