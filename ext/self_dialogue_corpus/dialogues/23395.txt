Do you like movies
Yes I love them.
Let's talk about movies then
Sounds good
Do you have a favorite?
One of my all time favorite movies is the mask
Oh I forgot about Jim carry
He's a good actor, and so funny
He is, I wonder what he's up to these days
No idea, doesnt seem like hes acting anymore.
I enjoyed liar, liar.
That one's funny too
He is crazy
He sure is
I wish he would make more movies
Me too, we need more Jim carry in the world
I used to be upset with him when I was younger?
Really?
Yes for some reason I thought he was cute
I guess he is in a crazy way
