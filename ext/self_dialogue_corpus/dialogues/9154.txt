I love that old time rock n' roll.
Hahaha. Bob Seger.  He did some great songs. I loved Turn The Page.
Yeah, that is an all time classic.  Every rock band has to do at least one great ballad.
So what are some of your favorites?
Not many people seem to have heard this one, but Black Sabbath did Solitude on their Black album.  I love it.
I never heard that one.  I'll have to look it up.
So what is one of your favorite ballads?
How about Whitesnake, Is This Love?
Oh man, yes, that is a great rock ballad. Did you like Journey's Open Arms?
Oh yeah.  That's a great, too. It was with a fantastic clip in the movie Heavy Metal.
