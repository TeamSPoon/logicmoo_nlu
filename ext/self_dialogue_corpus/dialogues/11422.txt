We were riding in the car with some young people and Come Together by Aerosmith came on the radio.  I like that, but I really prefer the original by the Beatles.
The Beatles?  Isn't that the band Paul McCartney was in before Wings?
Um, yeah.  If it hadn't been for the Beatles no one would have ever heard of Paul McCartney. He and John Lennon wrote most of their songs, too.
John Lennon - didn't he get shot?
Yeah, an obsessed fan shot him in front of his apartment building. That was a dark day.
So after the Beatles, did John Lennon do anything?
He did some albums with his wife, Yoko Ono. Probably the biggest hit was Beautiful Boy, written for his son.
Oh yeah.  I think I remember his son coming out and doing an album, too.
No, that was Julien Lennon.  He was John's son by his first wife and John wasn't really part of his life. Beautiful Boy was written for Sean, who was Yoko Ono's son with John.
Oh, okay. I guess I didn't know that much about the Beatles.
