Hey, have you seen Ender's Game?
No, but I've read the book. Have you seen the movie?
Yeah, I'm not sure what I think.
Oh, that's too bad! I was thinking of going to see it!
Well, they have a great cast and the special effects are fantastic.
That sounds great!
Yes, it does. Unfortunately, they did not utilize the cast until Ben Kingsley came into the movie.
What do you mean?
They tried to cram too much into one movie.
That's too bad! There is a lot to the book.
Yeah, apparently it took many years to finally finish this movie. I guess there were a lot of disruptions.
That's too bad. Well, I might still go see it.
The last quarter of the movie is great in my opinion. I felt like I finally got to know Ender better.
What about the first three quarters?
They literally flew through the characters.
You mean there's no character development?
No, hardly any, even though they had great actors for the parts. They just hardly gave them any lines or airtime.
Maybe I'll wait for it to come out on Netflix.
Some of the special effects make it worthwhile for the big screen. The battle room is awesome!
Okay, I'm going to go look up theaters that are still playing it. Thanks!
