I saw Fast and Furious Six last night.
Who directed it?
Justin Lin, again.
Same old crew?
Yes, Vinny Diesel, Paul Walker, Dwayne Johnson.
What happens in the movie?
Johnson persuades Diesel and Walker to go after a bad guy in exchange for amnesty.
Same old.  I hear Letty turns up.
Yes, they get back together.
Very convenient.
