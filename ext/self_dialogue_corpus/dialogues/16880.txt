Hey, what's this song? I'm really digging it.
It's a new song from the DJ Khaled album. It's called "I'm the One."
Is that Justin Bieber?
You bet it is!
Have you listened to the album all the way through?
It's not actually all out on Spotify yet. There is a Rihanna song and another collaboration with Calvin Harris.
When does the album come out, then?
I think it actually came out June 23? Spotify is just catching up.
Sounds like he's got some good collaborations. Who else is on the album?
Definitely! A song with Alician Keys, one with Migos, one with Chance the Rapper, one with Beyonce.
With Beyonce? No way!
Haven't heard it yet though. Come on Spotify!
DJ Khaled keeps screaming "DJ Khaled!" Is that like his trademark?
He does that all the time! Quite annoying actually.
Like, we know this is the DJ Khaled album. He doesn't need to keep remind us!
What if Justin Bieber screamed "Justin Bieber" every 15 seconds?
Oh geez, I'm constantly trying to forget that I'm listening to Justin Bieber.
Me too. This is more up his alley, though. No more Latin music collaborations.
I still can't believe he didn't know the words to "Despacito"!
Maybe he'll have better luck on this song.
