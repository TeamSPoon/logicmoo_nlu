Have you read anything about Baby Driver?
Kind of like Boss Baby?
What's that?
An SNL sketch where a boss is literally a baby.
No, I don't think it's about that.
Hold on, I'll look it up.
Okay.
It looks like a driving movie, like fast and the furious, but with some mental issue.
Oh, wait, it's a gangster/heist movie.
Yeah, that's what I'm seeing.
Looks good?
The reviews are awesome, 100%.
Yeah, but with how many reviews? It's not out yet.
40.
100% with 40 reviews and a week to go?
Yup!
This will be great, then. Let's go see it.
Okay...want to drive...baby?
I'm not Baby Driver.
Drat!
