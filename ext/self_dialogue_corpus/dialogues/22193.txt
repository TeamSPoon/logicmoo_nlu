Hey, I've been looking for a good movie to watch with my little girl, any suggestions?
Oh you asked just the right person. I love family movies, especially Disney movies.
Yeah my little girl is really in to them as well. I even enjoy watching them.
I watch them all the time. The other day I watched Frozen for the millionth time.
Oh my little girl loves that movie. Her favorite character is Anna.
Oh yes I love her to. My favorite character is Olaf.
We have watched that movie so much I am sure I can quote it by heart.
Well have you ever watched the animated movie Sing? It's not a Disney movie but it's really good.
No I have never seen that one before. What is it about?
It's a great movie where this man who owns a theater gets a bunch of people to sing and put on a concert.
Who are some of the stars in it?
There are so many. Scarlett Johansson, Matthew McConaughey, Reese Witherspoon, and Jennifer Hudson all play in it.
Wow, that is a lot of great actors.
It is a really cute movie. Does your daughter like to sing and dance?
Oh yes, she loves to sing and dance. When she hears music she always joins in.
This movie would be perfect for her then. The singing is great and the songs are really cute.
I will definitely have to check and see if I can find that one.
It should be out on DVD by now.
Great, now maybe I can have a break from Frozen.
Yeah, I completely know what you mean by that.
