I think that the older movies are better.  Have you ever seen Rear Window?
No I don't think I have.  What's it about?
James Stewart has two broke legs and is watching his neighbors through binoculars. He thinks one of them killed their wife.
Does he call the police?
At first, but the guy hid all of the evidence so James Stewart sets out to prove him guilty himself.
How does he do that?
He gets his girlfriend and his housekeeper to help him.  Grace Kelly plays his girlfriend.
Who plays the bad guy?
I think it's Orson Wells. It gets really scary because he catches on to being watched and then tries to kill James Stewart.
This sounds like a movie I need to watch!
