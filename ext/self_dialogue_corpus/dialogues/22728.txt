So at the weekend I was trying to find a film to watch with all the family, and I settled on "The Best of Laurel and Hardy".
You can't beat the classics! How did the family find it?
The children giggled from start to end. It was fantastic.
That's really good to hear! You always worry slightly when introducing them to something you love yourself.
They still stand the test of time. The pacing is slower than we're used to these days but the gags and the slapstick are just as good.
Is the film a collection of clips?
Not quite - more a collection of scenes. They've all been hand-colored too.
Really? What was their favourite scene?
It's hard to choose just one. The one where they break into the police commissioners house probably.
I like the piano moving scene myself.
Now you're talking! Lots of scenes that had to be filmed in just one take too!
Imagine that? Getting it right first time, every time...
Laurel and Hardy get the credit, and that's only right, but a lot of praise has to go to the bald guy too.
The one with the funny eye and mustache?
Yes, him. See, we don't even know his name.
I do. James Finlayson.
How did you know that?
Well, I'm a bit of a film buff aren't I?
OK, so tell me something else I don't know about Laurel and Hardy.
Oliver Hardy's real name was Norvell Hardy.
