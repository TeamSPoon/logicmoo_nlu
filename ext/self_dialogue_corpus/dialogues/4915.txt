How about the Red Sox scoring 10 runs in the ninth inning yesterday
who were they playing
Twins I think.
Oh yah, it was the twins, they suck.
for sure.  I think we have the Yankees next?
we need to get this this year, my boss at work is a yankee fan and he drives me nuts
I hear you, I'm sick of those clown fans.
I'm sick of oriole fans the most, they can shove it.
I know, always whining about how we play them
yeah, you hit one of their batters and they want to cry to mommy
haha, so true.  Who is pitching tonight
price I think, he hasn't been that good since we got him
yeah, what's up with that
I think his fastball is not as fast as it once was
he needs to start earning his money, bum
he will, I think we have the highest payroll in baseball
no, I think the dodgers do, but they need it
exactly, the red sox don't need all that money to beat the bums in our division
right on, I'll text you during the game when we are whooping them
dope, talk to you then
