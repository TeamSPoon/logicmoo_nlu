Have you ever seen Jaws?
No. Looks like a stupid shark movie like Sharknado or Sharks on a Plane or something stupid.
You've got it all wrong.
Prove it to me.
Jaws came along before there were dozens of movie about two headed sharks and sharks with tentacals. Jaws was the original shark movie.
Okay, I still don't hear anything that impresses me.
Jaws isn't a shark movie like all the shark movies out now. Jaws was a suspense movie. Jaws was a horror movie.
A shark horror movie: I'm not seeing how this is any different.
They build up the tension throughout this movie about the shark. Just how big is he? But they show very little of him.
Then what's the movie about.
That's what makes it a great movie. The subplots all keep you engrossed. The best subplot is about the chief of police having to take on this shark.
What happens?
This guy isn't your typical hero. He's afraid of the water. He's not brave or bold. He's an ordinary guy. But he has to do something extraordinary because so few people really believe there's a threat, or they think the threat is exaggerated.
Is it?
They throw in some incidents that may be from this shark but then aren't. So nobody believes there's a huge man eating shark. But there is. And he's attacking near the beach where tons of people swim and fish and boat.
How does he fight this shark if he's afraid of the water?
That's the great thing: he just does. Nothing helps him get over it, nothing proves it's an irrational fear. Quite the opposite.
But he faces the shark anyway because he's convinced no one else will.
Exactly. He doesn't overcome his fear. He does it even though he's afraid.
That sounds cool.
