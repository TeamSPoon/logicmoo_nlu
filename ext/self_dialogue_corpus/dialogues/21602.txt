Do you prefer classic films or modern films?
What do you mean by classic?
Like, old Hollywood type stuff from the 1950s.
Oh! Yeah, I like some of that. I also like modern stuff.
Have you ever seen What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?
That's an absolute classic! Who was in that one again?
Joan Crawford and Bette Davis.
That's right! They play the two sisters.
Yeah! What kinds of modern films do you like?
I'm more into Asian horror than anything else.
Really? What's that like?
It's really dark, but it's more about what you don't see than what you do see.
How do you mean?
They do a lot more with ambiance and soundtrack, so you're always on the edge of your seat.
Really? Can you recommend any good ones?
Start with something like Ringu or Ju-On. Those are considered two of the biggest classics.
I've heard of Ringu. Is that The Ring?
Yes! Exactly, it was released in 1995.
Did you like it?
It's one of my absolute favorites.
