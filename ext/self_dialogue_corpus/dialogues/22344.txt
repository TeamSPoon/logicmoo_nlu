What are your favorite types of movies?
Well, I really like scary movies and some action movies.
Do you like "chick-flicks"?
Not so much, I think they are too boring for me.
What about scary movies do you like?
Well, I like being scared! I like when a movie can get my blood pumping.
Have you seen the Hills Have Eyes?
Oh my goodness yes I have, what a scary movie!
I was scared watching it as well, I think the remake was better than the original.
I agree, but some parts were very hard to watch.
What kind of other movies do you like?
I like Without a Paddle, End of Watch, and Deadpool just to name a few.
I have seen all of those, and I would have to agree they are good.
End of Watch was crazy how it ended, I could not believe it.
I was not expecting that ending either, very shocking and sad.
What about you? What movies do you prefer?
I like dramas, movies that make you really think about life.
I enjoy some movies like that too, but I prefer action movies.
Have you seen any new movies in the theaters lately?
No, I usually wait for them to come out on DVD.
