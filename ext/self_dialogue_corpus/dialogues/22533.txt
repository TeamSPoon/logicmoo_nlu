Hey girl you know Wonder Woman is playing at the Highland theater, Do you want to go?
Girl maybe I have to work this weekend, Do you think it will be good?
It has been getting good reviews in the press!
Oh really who is the director?
A woman by the name of Patty Jenkins.
A female directed movie about a female super hero interesting no doubt.
Have you watched any extended trailers?
No have you?
No I don't want to see too much before I actually pay to see it.
Good point!
Are you taking the kids?
Maybe what is it rated?
PG - 13 is the rated for sequences of violence and action, and some suggestive content.
Well we shouldn't take the younger kids.
I agree.
What is the admission price?
I think it's $12.00 for adults and $9.50 for teens.
Wow even during the matinee showings?
Are matinee showings cheaper than evening showings?
Usually I'll double check and call you later.
