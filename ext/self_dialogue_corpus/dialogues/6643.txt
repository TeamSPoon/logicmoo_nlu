You know what sequel, I want?
Which one?
A Treasure Planet 2!
I don't know if they will make one of those.
I can dream.
What would be the plot?
Maybe Jim meets up with Silver sometime later in life.
Like after Jim graduates from the galactic navy or something?
Yes, and they can go on another adventure too.
If we are thinking of the same Long John Silver, the adventure may be to bail him out of trouble or find treasure.
