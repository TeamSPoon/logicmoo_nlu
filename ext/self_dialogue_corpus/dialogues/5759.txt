Have you seen the real life Cinderella movie?
I did see it and thought it was really good. I loved the character of Cinderella.
I really liked how it made me feel after. I loved how Cinderella was focused on being couragesly kind.
Ya I remember her saying that. I liked how they showed the backstory of Cinderella and told more about her father.
It makes me want to watch the movie again right now.
I know I was thinking the same thing. I like how Disney is doing this with other movies too.
Oh ya like The Jungle Book and Beauty and the Beast.
Ya I think Cinderella was still my favorite.
I agree Beauty and the Beast was good but not as good as Cinderella.
Ya I agree I didn't like the Beast as well as I did the Prince in Cinderella.
