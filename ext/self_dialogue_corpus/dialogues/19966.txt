am all set for the rich gang concert night
hmm you really seem excited about it
of couse i am,i listen to their song like everyday,so would be nice to see them perform live.
you say song like they do jazz music or rnb
yeah i should have rather say i listen to their rap right hahaha
oyeah so you know
maybe i was trying not to allow you give me a sermon on why you don't dig rap music
hahaha you nut mate,of course you know i don't like rap music
yeah yeah i know, maybe if you listen to rich gang for a day you'll change your views about rap music
rich gang? i have heard rap music from greats like 2pac,biggie,nas,jayz and yet i'm still not swayed so who's rich gang to make me.
hahaha but rich gang killing it at the moment
yes they are young and trendy for the new skool but real hiphop/rap is dead,everyother stuff called rap we hear these days are some noise.
i  disagree with that
then name one new skool real hiphop artist
too many like kendrick and jadakiss
hahaha too many and you could come up with just two, beside jadakiss has been since the time of 2pac , maybe kendrick i might hand over to you , he seem the realist and maybe jole cole
i forgot to mention rich gang as well,
that was a joke right?
no mate, rich gang spit hot bars
to me rich gang does hip pop and not hiphop/rap lets face it,
