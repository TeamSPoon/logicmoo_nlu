Who do you think will be picked for MVP this year?
Lebron James.
Yeah, he sounds like the obvious pick.
Who do you want to see get it?
Anyone but Isaiah Thomas.
Isaiah's the new bad boy in the league, isn't he?
Nah, he just needs to control his temper a bit.
He's no Dennis Rodman, that's for sure.
Rodman was a real character, wasn't he? Did he ever win MVP?
I doubt it.
I'd like to see Kawhi Leonard of the Spurs become MVP.
What are his chances?
I think he has a decent chance. He's team's highest scorer.
Advancing in the playoffs would probably help him get the award.
Lebron James will probably get it, though.
When will the award be announced?
After the end of season.
After? Since when?
Since this year. It's the first time the NBA has waited until the season is over to announce the MVP.
I guess they want to build up the anticipation, or something.
