Speaking of Mel Brooks, did you ever see Spaceballs?
Yeah. I saw it.  I didn't know he directed that one.
I think it's his last funny movie, to be honest.
What did he make after that?
Life Stinks, about a guy who becomes homeless, and then Robin Hood: Men in Tights.
You didn't like Men in Tights?
I thought it stunk!  I couldn't even finish it the first time.
I thought it was hilarious!  All the guys in the musical number?
I wanted to like it but it was just so dull.
You don't know what you're missing.
