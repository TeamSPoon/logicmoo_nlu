I've started listening to Lord Huron a lot.
Who is that?
It's a folk-rock or alt-rock sort of band.
Have I heard any of their songs?
You might have heard "Ends of the Earth." It's been played on a few TV shows.
That doesn't sound familiar.
I think you'd like them!
Really? Who do they sound like.
Hmm. Maybe the Lumineers?
I don't know them?
They have one album called "The Lumineers." But I think you've at least heard Ho Hey.
That one does sound familiar.
How about The Decemberists? They're also kind of folk-rock in the same way.
I think of them as chamber pop, but I do like them.
I especially liked "The Crane Wife."
O Valencia was always my favorite.
Well, if you liked that, maybe you should give Lord Huron a listen.
Could you lend me the album?
I'd be happy to!
Great!
