Who do you think is better, Kendrick Lamar or J. Cole?
That's a hard one, but I'll have to go with J.Cole.
It is a hard one, but Kendrick Lamar's "D.A.M.N" album makes him one of the greats.
I won't argue with you on that. Track 2, DNA, was epic.
Yes! I play that one and track 7, Loyalty featuring Rihanna almost every day.
I like how that album is different from his previous albums.
Me too. He really showed his skill and knowledge.
I agree. He also still told a story throughout the album.
He did! It sounded like he told a couple of stories throughout the album depending on how deep you listened to what he was saying.
I heard. I read that on the blogs.
