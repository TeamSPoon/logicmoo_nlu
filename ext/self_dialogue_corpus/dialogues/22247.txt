Hey you see any good movies lately?
No, I have not. I can't find anything I wanna watch! What do you think I should watch?
Deadpool is pretty funny! You will love it, I laughed the whole time.
I haven't seen it yet! We should watch it together.
Hey do you wanna go and see a movie with me?
Sure, but I have absolutely no idea what is out and playing! Any good ones out?
Well, we can go and see Suicide Squad. It's about all of the villains teaming up and doing good! Harley Quinn, The Joker, Deadshot...we need to see it!
Okay! Let's go right now, I can't wait.
Have you seen the movie Sausage Party yet?
Sausage Party? What kind of movie is that?
It's a funny, animated movie for adults. It's about how the food finds out the dirty truth that their fate is to be eaten by us humans! Or.."gods".
That sounds kind of interesting. I want to see it.
Hey, are you busy right now? Do you wanna watch The Jungle Book with me?
The new Jungle Book that came out in 2016? I haven't seen it yet, have you?
Yeah, it's really good! It's a live action version of the classic The Jungle Book movie.
Hm, okay. That sounds great! Let's watch it together later.
Have you seen Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them yet?
No, I haven't. What is it about?
Remember the Harry Potter movies? J.K. Rowling created a whole new series for Harry Potter fans.
Oh wow, I love Harry Potter! Wanna watch that movie with me?
