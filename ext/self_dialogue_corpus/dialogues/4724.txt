Do you like the Dodgers?
Not really, I'm more of a Reds fan.
How did you become a Reds fan?
I spend part of my youth in the Cincinnati area
Really, I didn't know that
Yeah, my dad would take me to the games when i was a kid
Was it a cool stadium back then
It was okay. Riverfront stadium; one of those old multi-purpose donut shaped stadiums
Astroturf?
Oh yeah, just like all of them back then
Where do they play now?
I believe it's called Great American Ball Park
Really? That's the actual name?
Yeah, I'm pretty sure it's a corporate sponsor
I'm a Red Sox fan myself
Did you live in Boston?
Nah, I just like them since I think it's a cool team
Or rather, you started liking them once they started winning World Series titles
Well, everyone likes a winner
Whatever, man.
