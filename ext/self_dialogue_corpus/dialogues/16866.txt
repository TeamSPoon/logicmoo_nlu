When I was 9 years old I wanted a Pocahontas party for my birthday.
Did you have one?
I did! I remember my mom making me a cake and the Pocahontas decorations.
That sounds fun! I liked that movie also as a kid.
It makes me want to look up the movie and watch it again.
I know, it does me too.
You remember that song "Just Around The Riverbend"?
Do I?
I can still see her face singing the song on the movie.
Me too! I loved her little raccoon friends.
I think there was just one, but he was pretty cute.
My ultimate favorite song though by far was "Colors of the Wind."
That was a beautiful song!
I remember I had it on a cassette tape and listened to it over and over.
Who sang that song do you remember?
It was Vanessa Williams.
I remember now! She has such a beautiful voice.
Right? I could listen to her all day.
I could too.
Talking about that movie makes me want to rewatch it with my kids.
