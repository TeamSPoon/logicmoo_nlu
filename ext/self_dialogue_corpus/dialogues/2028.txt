I hate how long the off season is for football.
It's only a few weeks.
a few weeks too long.
Well, your favorites probably enjoy the off season.
Why would they? They love playing.
So that they can rest up.
What do they need rest for?
for injuries they get while playing.
Yeah I guess that's true.
They also probably like spending time with their families.
I didn't think about that.
Do you still think the off season is too long?
Yes, but I see why it's necessary at least.
Well, that's come progress.
I'm not saying they don't deserve time off.
What are you saying then?
I'm just saying that I love football, and I miss watching it.
I miss it too, buddy.
We could always watch some old games.
Yeah! Let's do it.
