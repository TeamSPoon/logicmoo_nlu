I'm glad Avenged Sevenfold dropped that new album
Ya, the last one was a little too "Metallica" for me
How about that new drummer, Brooks Wackerman?
Is he the one that replaced The Rev?
No, they had Mike Portnoy for a while, then Arin Illijay, and now Brooks.
Oh, so what do you think of him?
Actually I really like him, his sound is a lot more like their original sound
Ah, I see, so you like their new album then?
Yes, a few songs are weird but mostly it's very good; especially 'Sunny Disposition'
I'll have to check that one out!
