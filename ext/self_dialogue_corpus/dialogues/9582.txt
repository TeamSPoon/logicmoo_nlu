Do you have any idea what Biggie Smalls real name was?
I want to say it was Chistopher something.
Oh that's right! Christopher Wallace.
He was definitely one of the greats, the best of all time.
I know. Can you imagine how popular he would be had he not been killed?
Oh my goodness yes!
I still listen to his music.
I do too, what's your favorite song by him?
"Juicy" is probably one of them.
I love that one too. One of mine is "Big Poppa."
