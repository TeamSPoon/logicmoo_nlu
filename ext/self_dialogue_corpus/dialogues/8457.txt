This is going back a ways, but the Beach Boys really were a good band.
Would  you call the rock or pop?
At the time rock, but now its clearly pop
I get around was such a hit!
So was Barbara Ann!
They wrote some great riffs!
Yeah and people still like their music today
I guess thats the true test, huh?
Yes and thats why I think they are such a great pop band
They had a real variety in the kinds of music they wrote and sung.
