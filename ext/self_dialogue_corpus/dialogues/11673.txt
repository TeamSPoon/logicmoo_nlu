Hi, is that a beatles song?
Yes it is the Beatles song "I want to hold you hand".
I love that song! I also like Strawberry Fields.
That one is alright if you like a slow song. I like a faster one.
Yea I do like their faster songs like Help.
It is a great song that you want to Jam to.
Yes I also like the Beatles  later songs like I want you.
Oh that is a great one! "She's so heavy.."
I have to say that their later songs were not as good.
I know it is like the Beatles were doing something to make them crazy.
