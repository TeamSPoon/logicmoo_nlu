What kind of music do you listen to?
I don't listen to much of the new stuff. I like a lot of the older stuff.
Same here. Do you like '90s music?
I like some of it. There wer a lot of interesting bands back then.
Yes. The grunge movement was really big.
I like grunge music. I like stuff like Nirvana and Stone Temple Pilots.
The drummer from Nirvana went on to form Foo Fighters.
I like Foo Fighters. It seems like you don't hear much from them nowadays.
I agree. There's not much continuity in music these.
Hip Hop is really big, which is fine. It's just that it seems like there's that lack of classic talent that lasts a long time.
True, other than artists like Eminem. He's still around, and still considered very good.
Eminem is considered one of the best. I've just never really listened to him much personally.
What other kind of music do you listen to then, when not listeing to rock music?
I like classical, actually.
Classical is good. We wouldn't have good movie soundtracks without classical music.
Yes. Some of the best soundtracks make use of existing classical music.
There's also new music written for movies that becomes iconic, like Star Wars.
Yes. I think everyone recognizes the them to Star Wars.
In a way, it reminds a little of that song Flight of the Valkeryies.
That's another song that everyone recognizes when they hear it. Beethoven's 5th is another.
