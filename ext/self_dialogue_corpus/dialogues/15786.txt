You know who I loved when I was younger?
Who?
Madonna!  I don't ever hear about her anymore.
Oh yeah, I used to love her too.  She was my idol back then.
Mine too!  I had every album.
Remember the Immaculate Collection?
Of course!  And they would have Madonnathons on MTv.
Oh yeah, I would always tape those.
Me too!  I also had all her movies.
She was great.  Some of her later music got a little weird.
Like what?
Justify My Love, Music, things like that.  It got a little electronic.
Yeah, I remember that.  I still liked it though.
I thought it was allright it just wasn't as good as her original pop stuff.
No, it really wasn't.  I wonder how old she is now.
I don't know, she's gotta be pretty old.  We were listening to her back in the eighties.
Yeah, true.  What was your all time favorite song of hers?
Probably Get Into the Groove.  What was yours?
That's really hard to say.  Maybe Cherish?
I loved that song, too.
