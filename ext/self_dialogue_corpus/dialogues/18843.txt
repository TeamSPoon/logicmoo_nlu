Name some songs you think transcend time.
You mean songs that everyone likes or appreciates no matter when they came out?
Yeah, I was thinking...Celebration by Cool and the Gang. It's always played at graduations and stuff like that.
We Are the Champions by Queen is big with sporting events.
So is We Will Rock You.
And Another One Bites the Dust.
What about Hotel California?
Yeah, everyone knows it but I don't its associated with anything in particular.
There are a lot of love songs that always get played at weddings.
That's true. Can't Take My Eyes Off Of You by Frankie Valli.
The Way you Look Tonight, Sinatra
Yep, then there's Marry Me by Train.
Shouldn't that come before the wedding.
Probably. This Will Be by Natalie Cole.
Good one. Some of those are classic wedding songs.
How about Nickelback's Photograph.
Matchbox 20, How Far We've Come. Remember that one?
Yeah, that sounds familiar.
There are so many, I think everyone recognizes them.
Yeah, some are just classics. They will always be played as a rite of passage.
