Have you seen the movie Spinal Tap?
Is that the movie with the European band?
Yeah, its a really funny movie about a band named Spinal Tap.
Yeah, I saw that one a long time ago.
Whats your favorite part in that movie?
I love the part where they say their speakers are louder because they go up to 11.
That movie is famous for that part, haha.
Yeah, it really is. I like how the band members are total idiots.
Its so funny how they run a band but none of them know whats going on.
It really seems like they have taken too many drugs or something.
