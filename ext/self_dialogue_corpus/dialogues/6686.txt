Have you seen the Pirates of the Caribbean movie?
No I was not a fan of any of them.
Wow thats a shocker.
I mean it was a ride what more can you do.
Its an easy tale to tell.
That doesnt sound promising.
The movie was so good.
Well I can tell.
Though I think the last one did poorly at the Box Office.
Disney needs to kick out more animated films.
