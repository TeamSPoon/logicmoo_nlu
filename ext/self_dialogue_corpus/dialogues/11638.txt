Picture yourself on a boat on a river...
What are you singing?
Um. The Beatles?
Really? I've never heard that song.
Huh. It's Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds!
I guess I've only heard the songs in the musical Across the Universe
look, that was a good movie but...i'm disappointed
sorry! i'll listen to lucy next
the worst part? it was IN the movie! they just saved it for the credits
oh...well then
