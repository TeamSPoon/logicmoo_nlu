I haven't, is it any good?
Clean Bandit is a fairly new group, and they released a few videos, but their first album was released in 2014.
What songs are on the album that I may have heard on the radio?
The album is called New Eyes, and there is a song called Rather Be and Heart on Fire that I like.
Who was the label for it?
Bad Boy Records was the label for this album.
I haven't heard of that company. It is exciting to see new artists though!
Real Love and Come Over is popular on it too. They are going to be a real hit.
Re the y on the Billboards yet?
Yes, they are.  They are doing well.
What type of music do they play?
They play house music, electropop, and baroque pop mostly.

Jack Patterson and Grace Chatto are the producers on this album.
I think I will go on over to Barnes and Noble and pick out some of their songs to listen to.
You can also go on youtube, they have some there as well.
What should I look for?
Rockabye ft. Sean Paul & Anne-Mariem that is the song that has over 1.1 billion hits on it.
Wow, thanks! I will check it out.
