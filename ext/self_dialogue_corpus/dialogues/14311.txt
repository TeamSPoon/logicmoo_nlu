I can't watch Lebron tonight!
Oh, I forgot the game was coming on tonight.
It comes on tonight at 8:30.
I should come over.
You are gonna have to wear your jersey.
Okay, maybe I will wear my Irving Jersey.
That sounds good.
Do you think the Celtics may steal a win?
Heck no! The Cavs has it in the bag!
Not a slight chance?
Absolutely not. its their first game home.
Oh, this might not be good.
I am gonna call this a 35 point game win easy.
Little Isiah, on the Celtics, may show up tonight.
What did I say? There is no possible way.
Cleavland is on fire!
Told you. Irving and Love together are going to be unstoppable.
I think that I better go pull out my jersey.
I am going to get the snacks ready,
See you in a few.
