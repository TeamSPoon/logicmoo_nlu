I'm glad Harry and Ginny got together at the end.
He was supposed to be with Herminone.
Hermione loved Ron.
No. She settled for Ron. She was in love with Harry.
Where did you get that from?
Harry was the star of the book. Harry was "the Boy who lived". Who wouldn't love him?
Just because someone's a hero, doesn't mean people automatically love them.
No, but look at everything they went through together. It wasn't Harry and Ron. It wasn't Hermione and Ron. It was always Harry and Hermione.
I think they saw each more as brother and sister.
I don't care. Harry and Hermione belonged together.
