Have you heard Miley Cyrus's new song Malibu?
I have and I like it.
I think it's much better than the other songs she's done since she stopped being Hannah Montana.
Oh I loved the Hannah Montana songs.
Me, too. G N O is probably my favorite.
I think Rock Star was one of her best songs.
I like how she always had new music playing on her TV show.
I watched her show all the time.
Maybe her music is getting back to that kind of style again.
I hope so.
