I finally watched "A hard day's night" the other day.
How was it?
Well after hearing about how great it was for about 25 years I must admit I was kind of disappointed.
Why?
The movie didn't have much of a plot, but the music was awesome.
I haven't seen the movie myself. What songs do they sing?
Well, the title track of course, in fact that's at the very beginning of the movie. That I think is one of the best parts of the movie.
I've seen parts of that video; that's when all the fans are chasing them.
All of them except for Paul who is sitting on a bench in disguise reading a newspaper.
Yes I remember that.
