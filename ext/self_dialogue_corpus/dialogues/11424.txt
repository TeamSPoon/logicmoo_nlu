What do you think is the weirdest song the Beatles ever recorded?
Revolution 9.
Why is it so weird?
Because the track keeps saying number 9 over and over.
That's it?
Also, supposedly if you play it backwards it says, :Turn me on dead man."
OK. That's weird.
It was all part of a rumor that Paul was dead.
So why do the song?
Because it was a clue about Paul being dead.
