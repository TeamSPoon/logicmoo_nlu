Are you going to the Rascal Flatts concert?
Yes, I just bought a cute outfit for the occasion.
What's your favorite song of theirs?
"My Wish" without a doubt.
Why's that?
We sang it at my high school graduation.
That's such a perfect song for that occasion.
What song did they sing at your graduation?
I can't even remember to be honest.
How can you not remember what your graduation song was?
It might have been "In My Life" by The Beatles.
That's another great pick for your graduation.
Really? I wasn't super impressed.
Yes because it's not like a super stereotypical option but it still works.
What would you consider a stereotypical graduation song?
"Friends Forever" by Vitamin C.
Oh, true. I didn't even think of that.
Yeah, I think it was definitely written for some time of graduation.
Probably. I remember listening to it the day after graduation and just crying.
Same here! And music never makes me cry!
