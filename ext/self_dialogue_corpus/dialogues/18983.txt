I love metal so much. Do you like it?
Yes metal is great. Have you ever heard of the band Deicide?
No I have not. That sounds scary!
They are a scary band they are very loud.
It is loud, but is it good?
Yes. The songs are structured very well.
That is good to know. I don't just want loud noise.
Same here. They are actually very skilled musicians.
How long have they been around?
They have been around since the early 90s and I believe they still tour today.
That is great. That is some longevity!
It is. It is because these guys are good at what they do.
What is a good place to start if I want to get into them?
I would check out their self titled album.
I will check that out. What is a good song on it?
The song Deicide is great.
So the song is Deicide, by the band Deicide, on the album Deicide?
Yes it is. It will mess with your head.
That is the type of music I want. I go to music to escape reality.
Same here. Go buy that CD today!
