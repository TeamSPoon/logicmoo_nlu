I love the Monkees! They are my favorite rock music band!
They are not really a band!
What do you mean? They have several hit songs in the rock music genre.
They were put together just for the television show.
Perhaps, but they still appeared on the rock music charts.
It was all manufactured! You should like some real rock music instead.
Like who?
You should listen to the Rolling Stones, The Beatles, or even The Kinks. They were put together naturally.
What do you mean by natural?
They grew up together as friends. They had a common dream -- to be rock music stars.
