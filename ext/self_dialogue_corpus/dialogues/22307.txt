So, what kind of movies do you like?
I have been really into the superhero movies lately.
Are you a Marvel or DC movie person?
I love the Marvel movies.
Why do you like Marvel better than DC?
The DC movies are all so dark.
I know what you mean.
They all try to be all self important and lack any real fun.
Have you seen the new Guardians of the Galaxy movie yet?
No, I haven't gotten around to it yet, but I loved the first one.
The first Guardians movie was some of the best fun I've ever had at a movie.
Are you going to see the new Spider-Man movie this summer?
I am definitely going to see it the first weekend when it comes out.
The team up with Iron Man looks super fun in the trailers.
Did you see the latest Spider-Man trailer yet?
Yes, I just saw it last night.
What other movies are you going to see this summer?
I think I want to go see Wonder Woman as well.
I hope they don't mess it up.
From what I've seen so far, the reviews look promising.
