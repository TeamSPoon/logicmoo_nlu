People are always asking me what movies I like but no one ever asks what movies I don't like.
Why would they want to know what movies you don't like?
I think what a person doesn't like tells as much about them as what they do like.
I see your point. So what movies don't you like?
I don't like movies about zombies for one. I went to see The Mummy and was very disappointed that it was more about zombies that mummies.
I'm not sure I follow you. What's the difference between mummies and zombies?
Well a mummy is just a dead person that has been preserved either by accident or on purpose.
Okay, so zombies are dead people too. Aren't they?
Zombies are dead people who come back to life. That's just stupid.
Didn't you expect The Mummy to be about dead people?
Of course, but it was one scene after another of people getting the life sucked out of them and then animating again. I didn't like it.
Did you see the older movie called The Mummy? The one with Brendan Fraser?
Yes and I liked it a lot better. There was more of a story and it wasn't about zombies.
I guess I'll have to go see the movie for myself. It's supposed to be scary.
It wasn't scary. It was just gross.
Is there any other movie you don't like?
I didn't like Forrest Gump. I just couldn't get into it.
Well you're in a minority there because Forrest Gump has a huge following. Don't you like Tom Hanks?
Actually I think Tom Hanks is a fantastic actor. I just didn't like the movie Forrest Gump.
I'm not sure what that says about you. I think I'd rather know what movies you like.
