I don't know what to listen to. It's summer and I want something new, but fun.
After Laughter, Paramore's new album is pretty amazing.
Paramore? I thought they were emo?
They were? But this new album is a little different, they were never too dark or depressing in the first place.
I liked that song, The Only Exception.
Then you should listen to this album, it's like that, but more updated.
I'll check it out, what songs are the best?
Well there's Hard Times which everyone seems to like.
Sounds cheerful.
It actually makes me feel better when I'm down. Because it's talking about hard times but it's got a great beat so I start singing along and start to feel better.
That's cool, but I don't know if I like songs like that.
Then you could try, 26.
That's a song?
It is, it's my favourite on this album. It's kind of soft and slow.
Is this supposed to be more cheerful than Hard Times? Or is this another depressing song?
It's not as down as Hard Times, it's slow, but it's beautiful. It's about having hope not matter what, not giving up on your dreams.
That sounds...upbeat. You really like the cheerful stuff, huh?
You know for someone who wants such happy music, you sure are negative.
Why do you think I need the happy music? It balances out my sparkling personality.
You should probably just listen to Cake by the Ocean and Can't Stop the Feeling.
