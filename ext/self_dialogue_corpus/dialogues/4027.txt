Have you seen Batman Begins?
Yes, Bale was the best Batman.
Either that or he was just given the best plot.
That too.  Raz Agul was a good bad guy and Liam Neisan was perfect to play him.
I know right?  I like the realism that was brought to it too.
Yeah, and almost the whole movie was genesis movie.
Yeah, not a quick few minutes in the start.  The whole thing was becoming Batman.
That's what made it so good.
Some of the lines too.
Like Bruce Wayne "does it come in black?"
