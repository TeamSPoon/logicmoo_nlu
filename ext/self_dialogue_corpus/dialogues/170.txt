Did you like Ben Affleck better as Daredevil, or Batman?
Can neither be an answer?
Haha, I'd probably say I belived him more as Daredevil, but Batman v Superman was the better movie.
I agree with that, but I just don't think he was a good Batman.  Sure, he looked the part, but...
But, he's been around so long that you had a hard time buying him as Batman.
Exactly!  It was like Ben Affleck cosplaying as Batman.  Speaking of Daredevil, what is your favorite Marvel Netflix show?
Hmmm, tough question.  They're all good for different reasons, but I'm going to go with Iron Fist.  I really liked the main character, and the fish-out-water conflict.
I'm going to say Daredevil-- it's gritty, and Vincent D'onofrio kills it as Kingpin.
I would really like to see the "Defenders," show up in the MCU.
Yeah, that'd be awesome.  Maybe in Infinity War.
