Are you watching the NBA playoffs this year?
Yes. I am watching the playoffs, especially the Warriors and Cavs games.
Do you think the Warriors and Cavs will sweep all the teams during the playoffs?
So far it seems like they will sweep their way to finals.
Do you think coach Steve Kerr not being able to coach will affect the Warriors?
It will have some effect, but I think the Warriors are a good enough team to win even without Kerr coaching.
Who do you think is the best player on the Golden State Warriors?
I think Kevin Durant is the better overall player, but Steph Curry is the best shooter on the team.
Do you think Lebron can win more championships than Michael Jordan?
Lebron is still young and in his prime.  If he stays healthy and on good teams, he has a chance.
Do you think Lebron James is becoming a better three point shooter?
So far in the playoffs this year, it seems like Lebron is adding the three point shot to his arsenal.
Do you think Steph Curry will become the all time leader in three pointers?
If he stays healthy and continues to play at a high level, he is on his way to becoming the all time best three point shooter.
Do you think Kevin Durant will be able to win a championship this year?
Joining the Warriors gave Durant the best chance of winning a championship this year.
Do you think the Warriors versus the Cavs will become a good rivalry?
If the teams stay together for many years, they will probably face each other a few more times in the finals.
Do you think the Warriors might be able to sweep the Cavs this year?
The Warriors are a great team, but Lebron and Cavs should be able to win a few games, maybe even the series.
