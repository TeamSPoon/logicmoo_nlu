What do you think about the Star Wars prequels?
They had some good moments, but overall I felt they were pretty disappointing.
What were some of the things you liked about the movies?
I really enjoyed the pod racing in the first film. I also enjoyed seeing lots of Jedi throughout all the films.
I thought having that many Jedi was overkill. It seemed lame to just flood the films with Jedi.
That's a fair point, but I felt that the Jedi were never properly explained or explored in the original trilogy.
I thought that made them more mysterious and interesting. We don't need to have everything fully explained in order to enjoy what's going on.
I think that was one of the big problems with the prequels, George Lucas tried to overexplain everything.
Yeah, that's how we ended up getting the "midi-chlorians" explaination of the force.
Right, Star Wars is science fiction, but it should be a lot more focused on the fiction than the science.
