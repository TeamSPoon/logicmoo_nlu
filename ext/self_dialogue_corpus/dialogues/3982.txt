Do you like old thriller movies?
Yeah I do, like "Night of the Living dead"?
Yeah! That was the first  zombie movie.
Yeah, it was creepy, seeing all those zombies.
The movie is in black and white, which make it more scary.
I like the zombie movie called"The Crazies".
Yeah, I saw that one too, this was a 1970 movie.
I am going to the movies to see "The Puppet Master" it is a remake of the original.
I saw "The Puppet Master" 1,2,3 they were scary to watch.
The "Puppet Master is about all those little dolls coming to life, it is a fun movie to see.
