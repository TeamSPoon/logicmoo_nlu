Have you seen the movie Moana?
Yes, The one with island girl who wants to sail.
What is your favorite part?
I like when the dimi god Maui sings a song called "You're welcome."
Don't forget the part when he is teaching her to sail and tells her to stick her hand in the water to tell if it's getting warmer.
Yes! and come to find out it is warmer because he is peeing in the water.  She cried out "How disgusting".
Do you think that her father was too hard on her?
I think he just didn't want to lose another person to the sea.  He was scared of the water and won't let anyone else try.
What do you think about the songs?
I think they are catchy but they are not sung as good as I think they could be.  Unlike Disney's frozen.
If you could compare Moana to any other movie what would it be?
I was say it reminds me of the movie Castaway with Tom Hanks
Why?
Because he is stuck on an island.
He was all alone, she has a village and a family
Yes but he had wilson, The volleyball to keep him company.
What do you think was in the last box he was to deliver years ago.
I think it could have been divorce papers and to him it didn't matter.  He got the package to where it belonged.
If you were helen hunt's character, would you have taken him back?
No, because I would have already been married, children, and mourning for him was done.  Already moved passed his disappearance
