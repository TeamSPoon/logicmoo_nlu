Did you see Pete's Dragon?
No, but I used to love the original one.
There was an older version?
Yeah, it was from the 70s, I think.
Who was in it?
I don't remember.  Actually, I had looked it up a while back and the kid that acted in it doesn't even act anymore.
Was it good?
We loved it.  We had it on VHS.
I loved the new one.  I might have to check out the original.
You would probably like it.
