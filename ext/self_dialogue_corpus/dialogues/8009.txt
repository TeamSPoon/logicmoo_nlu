I miss the old days of pop music.
Oh yeah? Like what?
You know, boy bands. Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera.
I mean, they are all still around.
But they aren't the same! and I can't listen to that One Direction garbage.
You're too picky. Pop music can mean so much. Stop being stuck in the past.
I just really like 90s pop.
What else do you listen to?
Mostly just top 40s stuff.
So much of that is Pop!
