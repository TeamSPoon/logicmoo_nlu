Are you ready for some football!!!!!
Yeah the season can't get here soon enough.
I hear ya, I wish my Detroit Lions had a chance but you know how they are.
That's a rough one man, they always suck.
Yup I know, once in my lifetime it would be cool to see them win it all, but I'm not holding my breath.
Well my Packers are looking good this year, we got a shot.
Yeah their pretty good every year, I don't know how those fans sit outside in that frozen tundra.
It's tough, but we love it! Who do you think will win it all this year?
It's hard not to say the Patriots, they are like a machine and I think Brady and Belichick want one more before they retire.
Yeah I hear ya, but I don't think they repeat. I think Seattle or Green Bay win it all this year.
Being a Michigan man, I would like to see Brady get one more and retire
The Cowboys might also make some noise this year, They looked good last year, and this year should be better.
Yeah Romo was pissed when Prescott took over, but he is a better QB.
Ezekiel Elliott is a real good back also. They are pretty solid overall.
You doing any fantasy this year?
I'm on Fanduel, so good to go.
Alright side bet with my Lions and your Packers. Case of beer for whoever wins our head to heads, no points.
You're on, get ready to send me some of that good Founder's beer buddy
Lol. yeah good luck.
Go pack!!!!!
