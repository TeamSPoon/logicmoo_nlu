I'm not a diehard NFL fan. But, I used to like watching the Colts play with my dad.
Yea, I don't watch that much football, but I used to really like to watch Peyton Manning play.
Me too. He was my favorite player.
I hated when Indiana let him go.
I would still occasionally watch him when he played for Denver.
Me too. I hated when he played in the Super Bowl and lost with them.
Oh, I know. That game was horrible.
He was great. Too bad he retired.
He seems like a good guy. I've watched his brother, Eli play too.
I haven't seen him play that much.
Well, like I said, I don't really watch football all that much, especially NFL.
I like college football.
Me too. We go to some games now and then.
Do you still watch the Colts since Peyton is gone.
Sometimes. I rarely watch an entire game.
Luck seems to be a pretty good quarterback.
Yes, from what I've seen. But he's no Peyton Manning.
Not yet anyway.
We'll just have to wait and see how the season goes.
It will be here before we know it.
