What is a good comedy movie to watch with a guy?
Guys don't really like romantic comedies, so I would go with something that is comedy and action.
Okay, so what is good example of that?
I really liked Ride Along 2. Kevin Hart is really funny.
Oh yeah, I saw that. I think he and Ice Cube make a great pair.
I agree. It was almost just as funny as the first one. I'm glad they made a sequel.
I thought the first one was hilarious. But you're right, the sequel wasn't bad.
It had action and some slapstick comedy, which is always great.
I liked the part when Kevin Hart's character was pretending to be the African prince.
It really looked like Ice Cube punched him. I think he enjoyed that.
