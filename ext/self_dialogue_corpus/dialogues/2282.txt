Did you watch last year's Super Bowl?
Was that the Patriots comeback?
Yes
No, I did not
Why not?
I am not a football fan
Yes, but it was amazing even to a non football fan
Well, not me
Do you watch any NFL?
No
Did you ever?
I used to like the Dolphins
What made you stop?
They never won
You are not a loyal fan
I used to be, but I got tired of it
Well, how about I take you to a game next year?
Sounds good
That will make you like it again
I hope so.
