Who do you think is the best lyricist in hip-hop?
I would say Nas.  Maybe with Andre 3000 coming in at a close second.
Nas's first album, "Illmatic" is definitely a classic.  His second album, "It Was Written", was a good album too.
He was a young guy when he recorded those album.
Yep.  One of my favorite songs from "It Was Written" was a song called "The Message".
Is that the song that samples Sting's "Shape of My Heart"?
That is the one.
I love that song.  I get nostalgic when I listen to songs from that era.
Me too.  It remind of the good hip-hop that was coming out from New York City in the 90s.
There doesn't seem to be a lot of new talent coming out from New York these days.
