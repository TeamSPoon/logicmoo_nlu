Did you know they Snow White was Disney's first feature film?
Oh wow! No, I didn't know that.
Yeah,Walt was really proud of his accomplishment.
I can't say I blame him! I'd be proud if I ever made a movie!
Me too! Though I'd rather be a Disney Princess.
Ha ha! Now that would be something!
Wouldn't it? Could you imagine being a mermaid like Ariel?
I think I'd rather be like Belle from Beauty and the Beast.
Yeah, that Beast was kind of rugged and dreamy.
Sure, but I was dreaming of the dress and having talking objects that cooked and cleaned for me!
