Do you think there will be a new Back To The Future installment?
I'd love to see the characters again.
The way they left the third movie off, there's a lot there to build on.
Like what?
Doc Brown's sons and the time travelling train.
Oh, yeah.
I can't remember their names, though.
Jules and Verne?
That's it.
So, what would Back To The Future 4 be about?
Jules and Verne will be in their twenties and behaving irresponsible.
And then what?
One of them uses the time machine to save his girlfriend, or something.
Then time is screwed up, like that other movie?
What other movie?
The Butterfly Affect.
Yeah, something like that.
Sounds good, but I don't trust Hollywood to make a decent movie nowadays.
Which one's you're favorite Back To The Future movie?
Back To The Future 3.
