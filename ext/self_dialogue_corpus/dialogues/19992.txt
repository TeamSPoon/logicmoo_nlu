Well, I'm supposed to start a conversation with you about music, so what type of music do you like?
I'm kind of odd about music.
Oh, how so?
I like Christian music, but not a lot of the current stuff.
So you like hymns?
No, actually.
Really?
Yeah, hymns remind me too much of lulabies.
Is that so?
Yeah, I really wonder about churches that play only hymns, because it seems like they want their congregation to sleep through the sermon.
Well anyway, back to music, so what artists do you like?
I like Steven Curtis Chapman, Andrew Peterson, Twila Paris, Sarah Groves... the guy who does the "Broken but Beautiful" song.
Oh, I heard that one years ago.
I really liked it, but the stations don't play it anymore.
So who's your favorite artist of the bunch.
Andrew Peterson.
Why's that.?
He's songs seem more realistic than most Christian music, but it still has the instrumental sound that I like.
I'll have to check some of his stuff out.
I recommend "Silence of God."
