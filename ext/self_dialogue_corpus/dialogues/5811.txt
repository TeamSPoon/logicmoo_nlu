What do you think of the movie the Lady and the Tramp?
ItÂ´s one of the most romantic animated films?
Why do you say so?
There is scene where they are having an Italian dinner with a very romantic background.
Why is it called the Lady and the Tramp?
Because the female dog was brought up with manners, like a Lady and the male one was more like a street kind of guy.
Do you think the Lady was spoiled?
Oh yes she was! She still slept with her owners when she was an adult.
I remember in the movie that she worried, do you remember why?
Because of the new baby, she thought she was being replaced.
