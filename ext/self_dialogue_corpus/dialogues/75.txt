In Spiderman, do you think the green goblin was actually talking to Harry in the mirror, or was it just in his mind?
I think it was in his mind. But the film leaves that up to the audience to decide
It does seem to be the only time that the goblin is able to do anything beyond death
Harry found out about the goblin by accident
It really hurt their relationship when Peter got blamed for killing his Harry's father.
That was the saddest part of the movies, even more than the problems with Mary Jane and Peter
Peter had his own problems, and was not always a good friend
He was a young guy who had a plenty a power that he got without working for it
Peter was also under influence from the black goo
True
