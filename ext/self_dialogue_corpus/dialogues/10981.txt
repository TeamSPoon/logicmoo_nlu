Man, did you see the end to the Penguins and Senators game last night?
Yeah, that was such a good game.
Of course, it's always a good game when Pittsburgh loses!
You can say that again.
Bobby Ryan is really turning his season around in the playoffs.
I know, to think he ended up on the 4th line during the regular season ans now he's back to his scoring form.
The way he was able to beat the D and then the goalie was awesome.
I know Fleury never had a chance.
Kessel must of broke his stick when that goal went in.
I know the way he hit the cross bar at the end of the 3rd was crazy.
I'm sure they'll come out flying for game 2
I bet, being held to 1 goal will not sit well for them.
If I were the Penguins coach I would not change a thing.
Agreed, even their defense played well which is a shock.
If I was Ottawa I'd play the same style, clog the neutral zone and do not let them enter with speed.
Yep, and on offense I'd chip into the corner and play the body.
Oh yeah, try and wear down that defense which is already hurt.
I'd love to see Ottawa take the 2nd game as well and shut the fans up for once.
Time for someone else to come out of the East.
Either way I'm pulling for the Western conference, who ever that may be.
