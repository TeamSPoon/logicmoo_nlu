Finding Nemo really helped me get into the Disney scene.
Why did it take so long?
I just never liked animation.
But what did you like it specifically?
Seeing the journey that they go on and how it takes different turns.
I know what you mean.
Yeah so I thought Ellen DeGeneres did a wonderful job as Dory.
She got her own film because of it.
I did not see it
Neither did I, but we all know it was out.
