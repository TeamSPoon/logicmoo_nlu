Can you grab my phone for me and see who is calling me I am getting dressed for the dance club tonight.
What dance club are you going to and what group is going to be there?
I am not exactly sure yet i am waiting for my girl friend to get back to me but i know it is a Rock group.
Wow I like rock remember the old song from way back in the seventies I love Rock and Roll.
Yes I remember them it was the group called AC/DC but that one is not from the seventies i don't think so.
There have been many of numerous different groups with other Artists singing that same Rock and Roll song.
Joan jet I she came out with a lyrics and Britney Spears her too.
Cool I don't think i have ever heard those two where can i find those i want to hear what they sound like.
I guess you can try listening to the radio on the Rock stations and also maybe go check out You tube.
Thanks what time are you leaving that wasn't your'e friend on the phone it was marketing calls well when you do go enjoy the dance club and let me know who was there performing.
