Do you watch baseball
I love baseball
Do you do fantasy
I'm into it but not yet
It's tough
Fantasy?
Yeah it can be really hard
What's hard about it?
You have to watch the statistics
For teams or players?
Both really.
Yeah that seems tedious.
Man, Mookie Betts is having a good year though.
Mookie Betts huh?
Yeah, he's my first pick.
He's on Boston?
Yeah Boston.
I never pay attention to Boston
Well yeah that's why I do fantasy
So you can watch other players right?
