What's the first Lady Gaga song you heard?
Just Dance was the first one I heard on the radio
That song came out in 2008, right?
I think Akon was a co-writer of Just Dance
And RedOne.  His name gets a shout out at the start of the song.
I liked the video a lot too.  Lady Gaga produces really dynamic music videos.
I think my favorite early Lady Gaga video was Poker Face.
That was her next number 1 hit after Just Dance, right?
Yes, Poker Face is also on Lady Gaga's debut album.
The Fame was a really solid album. No wonder Lady Gaga became so popular.
