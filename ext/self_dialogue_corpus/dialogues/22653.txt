So what's your favorite movie of all time?
Probably Shawshank Redemption.
Well, that's a lot of peoples' favorite.
I know but it really is that good.
I never understood what was so great about it...Can you enlighten me?
For one thing, it's been said that almost every story is one of slavery to freedom.  This movie is the perfect representation of that.
That makes sense.  I just didn't enjoy it that much.
I also thought the acting was superb.
Morgan Freedom is still getting paid handsomely to narrate movies to this day!
Yes, he has quite the career going.  There is something soothing and authoritative in his voice.
True.  He was an excellent choice to be cast in that movie.
It was also Tim Robbin's most notable role.  I have heard both of them say that it was their favorite role.
Did they say why?
Yes, they said it was because it touched so many people.  I guess they still get letters and comments.
Wow!  When was it released again?
1994, I think.
That was a long time ago now!
I know...time moves so fast.
Well, I guess I'll give it another chance.
You really should!  We can watch it together!
