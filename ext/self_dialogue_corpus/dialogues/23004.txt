Do you remember how great Disney Channel Original Movies were?
Yeah, I still watch a few of them every year. Not the new ones, though.
Definitely not the new ones. Which ones do you watch?
Well, The Luck of the Irish is on every March, that's my favorite.
Oh, same here. I wonder what happened to those actors?
I know the guy who played Kyle was in a few other things and the girl is a model now.
Cool. Which other ones do you like?
Obviously Halloweentown 1, 2, and 3. Everyone loves those.
Those will never get old. I didn't like Halloweentown High, though.
Same. I hate when series change characters.
Yeah, I couldnt' finish it since the main character was different.
Smart House is great, too.
I remember the woman who played the smart house scaring me as a kid.
I know, that part was a bit creepy.
High school musical?
I liked the first 2. I never saw the one that was in theaters.
Neither did I.
My favorite would have to be Jonny Tsunami, though.
I completely forgot about that one!
I havent seen it in years.
