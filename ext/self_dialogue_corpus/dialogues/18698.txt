You know what I was listening to in the car yesterday?
No, what was it?
Classic rock radio.
Awwwww yeah. I listen to that a lot.
Really? I had never listened to it before.
Are you serious... why?
I don't know. Probably because I thought it was for old dudes.
Well maybe that means you're an old dude now. Let's see, what's your favorite classic rock band?
That's a tough one. Probably Led Zeppelin.
Nice choice. Frickin' John Bonham man. That intro to When The Levee breaks is the greatest sounding drum part ever.
Totally! Jimmy Paige is incredible too.
One of my favorites of all time, for sure.  But you know what?-
-I think I know what you're gonna say. Robert plant is annoying.
Well kind of... I wouldn't say he's annoying. But  I just think the instrumentalists in the band are better than him.
Right. I agree. If he was in a band that didn't have the craziest musicians ever, he would stand out as an amazing vocalist.
I mean, they probably wouldn't be as good without him.
Probably not. But honestly, Robert Plant's voice is the only reason I can't listen to too much Led Zeppelin in a row.
I guess I'm the same way. But dude, keep listening to classic rock radio, it's usually one of the best stations available.
Yeah, it was hit after hit. I'm gonna start listening to it more often.
Nice, I'll keep listening to it all the time because at 27 years old, I'm already an old man.
