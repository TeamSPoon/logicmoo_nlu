What is your favorite superhero movie?
Probably, Deadpool.
Oh really? Why do you like it?
The action and humor were great.
Who plays Deadpool?
Ryan Reynolds
Oh yuck.
Well, that's what I would have thought too, but he was actually good in this.
It can't be better than Logan though.
They are both awesome movies, but very different styles. I gotta admit that Hugh Jackman is amazing as Wolverine.
