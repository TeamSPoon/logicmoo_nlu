You've seen The Grudge right?
Yes, but felt it was mostly okay at best.
I would agree with your assessment, but you did know it was originally a Japanese movie right?
I had heard about this, yes but never felt the need to look further into it.
You really should, Ju-on is much better than it's American remake.
I know that was the case with The Ring.
The acting alone tends to set the Asian versions apart, still not sure why they felt Sarah Michelle Gellar was a good choice.
Yeah she's far from the first actress I think of when thinking scream queens.
Jamie Lee Curtis she is not!
Oh absolutely, there's no comparison there. Anyway I'll watch The original version of The Grudge and let you know what I think.
