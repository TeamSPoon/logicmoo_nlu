So, what do you think of Meek Mill?
He gets some bad press but I think he's one of the best lyricists out there.
I agree. I haven't found an album by him that I don't like.
I get a sense of realness from him. I believe he's lived what he raps about.
Definitely. He's really believable.
"Dreams and Nightmares" is one of the best club songs ever.
My jaw was on the floor the first time I heard that song.
When the beat switches, it's so intense.
That whole album is really good.
I only listen to maybe five songs off of it. They're all good, though.
