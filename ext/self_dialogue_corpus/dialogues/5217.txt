Have you ever watched Lilo & Stitch?
Yes! I watch it almost every month with my niece. She thinks I look like Nani.
I could totally see that! Isn't your niece a bit young to watch it since Lilo's parent's died?
No, I don't think that's the main point of the movie.
Well, what do you think the main point of the movie is?
Lilo & Stitch is about embracing family and showing them love! It's not about the absence of family.
True, I guess I never thought of it that way. I liked David in the movie, anyways.
Same here. He really became such an important person for Lilo and Nani.
That's why I liked him! I'll go watch the movie again tonight.
Mind if I come? I'll bring my Stitch plush!
