Do you like action movies?
I do! I love going to the theatre to see them.
What kind of action movies do you enjoy?
I really love action movies with strong female leads, what about you?
I'm really into dystopian action movies, a lot of them start out as books and are translated onto screen really well.
I love dystopian everything. Dystopian action films with strong female leads have really blown up in the last few years.
Thats so true. The entire action genre has really split into so many different categories, its no longer just blowing stuff up.
Yeah, I think it's because you can only blow so much stuff up before it gets boring for the viewers.
There's definitely some classics that are mostly just blowing things up that I still enjoy though.
I agree, you can't beat a classic.
