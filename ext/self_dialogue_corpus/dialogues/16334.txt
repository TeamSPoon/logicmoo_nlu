Do you like rap?
I hate rap.
It's disgusting now a days.
I can't believe some,of the stuff they play on the radio.
I know,it's terrible.
I hear some of it from my granddaughter. F-bombs throughout.
I don't know what the point is.
To be as disgusting playing music as you can be.
That's what it seems like.
Some of the rappers names are rediculous.
Fatty Wa,SnoopDog,Kodak Black. I mean come on.
I honestly can't stomach it.
It's not even music.
It's just swearing to a beat.
Exactly. Some of the names of songs.
How about,Juicy,Nuthin' but G Thang,Gangstas Paradise.
Great titles they aren't.
Rediculous names and music and lyrics.
I honestly don't understand the attraction.
I know and it's all high school kids that love it
