I can not believe the number of meme's there are about Star Wars on the internet.
Well, it is an insanely popular and influential series.
That's true.  I saw one the other day it was outside a coffee shop and they had a picture of Admiral Ackbar with his face next to a coffee cup and he's saying, "It's a frap!"
Haha... yeah, I've seen several of those "It's a trap!" related memes on various place on the web.  One I liked shows young Boba holding his father's helmet and it says, "Take your son to work day.  Not always successful."
Oh, that's terrible!  Funny, but terrible!
I thought so.
Oh, here's a good one, I remember.. what's the inside temperature of a Tantum?
Wait.. were those the creatures on that ice planet in Empire, right?  I don't know, what is the temperature?
Luke Warm.
Ooooh...booo!  Boo!  Hiss!  That's bad!  HAha.
