So why do you think all these retailers are failing?
Fashion is different these days
Dont you think its all cyclical?
Sure but theres a point where people will not pay X when they cant get it for Y
So what are you saying
Brands like Abercrombie who market higher end items are not going to keep up with other retailers
Who do you think is their main competition?
I would say H&M
They make alot of products
They do and they make them affordable for everyone
So does Abercrombie need to change their model?
No because they cant afford to sell items at the price point H&M does.
So you think we see them stop creating fashion?
In a sense, yes.
You can get the same clothes from H&M?
Not the same quality. They wont last as long
But they look the same, just need to replace them more often?
Yes but most of the clothes end up only lasting a season anyway before the next trend comes out.
I get where you are going
Yeah so as long as they keep up selling how they do, theyll meet their end.
