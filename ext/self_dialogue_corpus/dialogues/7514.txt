Have you watched all the Harry Potter movies yet?
Yes, I finally finished and I'm so sad there are no more!
Which one was your favorite?
Goblet of Fire! So much happened and poor Cedric.
Oh gosh I cried so much when he died.
He didn't deserve that! Voldemort is horrible!
I know right? So is Bellatrix though!
When she killed Sirius I almost died!
I cried for like 5 days!
Harry Potter is awesome though!
