I wonder when the horror movies began?
What?
What part of that don't you understand? When did the horror movies begin?
Well, it's a loaded question. First how do you define a horror movie? Suspense? Shock? Gore?
Um. I don't know. Horror movies, like Friday the 13th. Freddie, or Vampires, etc.
Sigh. I think you have to be more precise here. Horror film is a genre named after the fact. We has amassed a certain number of films that seem to have similar qualities
Like? What qualities?
Induces fear, creates suspenseful atmosphere, causing physiological responses in the audiences like elevated heartbeat, sweaty palms,
Ok. yeah. So that's the horror movie. When did that begin?
Um.. are you listening to yourself? I just said it's a genre we have created after the fact. Movies were in existence already, and we "decided" to call it the horror genre.
So... you don't know.
What!?!?! It's not something that's knowable. Thar's not an answerable question.
So.... You. Don't. Know.
...I do know.
Ok. Tell me. When did the genre of Horror movies begin?
Let me see. Wait. I shall go look it up.
That's cheating.
No it's not, and here. I'm looking up how we define a horror movie. See, as long as visual, literary, artistic expression existed, horrifying images, texts, and depictions existed.
That doesn't answer my question.
No, but it tells us why it is impossible to tell the beginning of the horror genre, because the depiction of horror has existed for many hundreds of years.
