Would Dave Grohl have been better served staying Nirvana?
I think the Foo Fighters are awesome.
They have a ton of hits and have been around for awhile.
Do you think they would have seen the light of day if Cobain doesnt die?
Its hard to say I dont think Grohl had singing parts in Nirvana.
No he didnt and that sort of held him back.
I think talented musicians find a way.
So maybe a side project?
Or Cobain would have broken up the band
Crazy to think that could have legitimately happened.
We wouldnt have alot of the songs Foo has done.
Monkeywrench was such a great song back in the day
I think most of their discography has held up over the years.
I couldnt agree more to be honest.
I just couldnt imagine never hearing those songs.
Maybe they become Nirvana tracks.
They made nothing even comparable to it.
I think they sound somewhat similar.
Foo Fighters has a smoother sound
And a bit more poppy I guess
