Did you hear the new pink track ?
I have not  but I  really like  her voice
It is  very powerful and  she  hits  amazing notes
I really  liked  perfect thats my  favorite  track
It is  really upbeat  and  has a nice  message
I would like to see her do a  duet with  Axle rose
It would be  so vocally strong  but  could they pick  the  right  vocals
I think they could work it out they are  both very artistic
It could be  like  Novemeber rain meets   Perect  it would  rock so much
I would  have bought that track
