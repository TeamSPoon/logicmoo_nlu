I don't really know what to make of Bluegrass.
That's an odd statement. What do you mean?
Well it's country except it's not, except when it is.
Not less confusing. How is it country?
Come on. It has banjos in it!
Ok but a banjo does not a country song make.
Ok fine, but it also has fiddles. Not violins, but fiddles!
Listen, bluegrass and country kind of come from the same place but they're different in a lot of ways.
Like how?
Bluegrass is wild. Think about how smooth and mellow a lot of country singers' voices are.
Yeah, they do have beautiful voices.
Now listen to the lead singer in a bluegrass band. That voice is almost always really twangy.
Like a banjo!
Will you lay off the banjos?
Ok fine, so the singing style is different.
The singing style and the musical style itself. Have you listened to much celtic music?
No, but we're talking about Bluegrass and Country here.
Well that's the thing. Bluegrass music, a lot of it, is more like Celtic than Country.
You think so?
Yeah, like dance music, reels and jigs and things. That's the root of bluegrass and it's what makes it different.
