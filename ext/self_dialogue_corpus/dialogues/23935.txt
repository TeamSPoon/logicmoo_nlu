Why do you hate Science fiction and fantasy movies?
I never understand science fiction and fantasy movies are all witches and wizards and dragons.
You don't need to fully understand science fiction movies. It's science Fiction. The key word there is Fiction.
I just don't like it. Never got into it.
Would you give it another chance if I asked?
What movie would you want me to watch?
Star Wars?
I saw Star Wars in theaters when it was re-released. I fell asleep.
Okay fine. The first one can be a little boring.
A little?
Fine. So we'll try a different movie. How about Starship Troopers?
What's it about?
Space Marines fighting off giant bugs.
That sounds gross. Who stars in it?
I don't know their names. I think it's the guy for Dawson's Creek.
Van Der Beek? Cool.
So, you interested? There's tits.
Okay. I'll try it.
Now, about fantasy movies.
You can't be happy with Star Wars Troopers?
