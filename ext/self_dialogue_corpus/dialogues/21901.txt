Hey, have you seen any good horror movies lately?
Well, I don't know if you'd quite call it horror, but we did watch something called "The Boy" that was really disturbing.
It kinda sounds disturbing!  I haven't heard of it.
Oh, well I hadn't either.  We ran across it on Netflix.
So what was it about?
It's really weird.  It's about this woman who takes a nanny job except it's not watching a child.
What do you mean, it's not watching a child?
It's watching a doll.
What on earth, a doll?
Yes.  Creepy, right?
No doubt!  So what winds up happening?
Well she's in this huge creepy house, and strange things keep happening.  It seems like the doll is alive.
So it's haunted or something.
Something like that.  And the owners of the doll treat it like a live boy.
Very odd!  I've never heard of anything like that.
Yeah, it just gets weirder and weirder.  She's all isolated there with the doll.
I would totally leave that strange situation!
Yeah, me too.  But she hangs in there in spite of obvious warning signs that she should leave.
Oh, typical horror theme.  Sticking around in spite of dreadful warning signs.
Yes, it really was.  The ending was disturbing as can be.
