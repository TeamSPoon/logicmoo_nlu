Which Star Wars movies villain is your favorite of all time?
My favorite is Darth Vader. And yours?
I would have to agree. His story line is just so tragic and captivating.
How do you feel about Kylo Ren in comparison to Darth Vader?
I don't think Kylo Ren can compare. Darth Vader just seemed much more powerful.
I agree. Kylo Ren is more of a wannabe dark Lord, but acts more like a rebel child.
I was surprised that the child of Han and Leia turned out dark in the first place though.
Yeah, me too. You would think that he would be surrounded by some very good influences.
I guess anyone exposed to the force is vulnerable to both sides of the force though.
Yes it can definitely go both ways, and the balance is hard to keep.
