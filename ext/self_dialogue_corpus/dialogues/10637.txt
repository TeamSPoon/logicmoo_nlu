Have you seen the Fast and Furious movies?
Yeah. I've seen most of them. I think they are getting repetitive though.
Really? I kind of like them.
It just seems that the whole premise has been lost.
What do you mean? There are cars, drugs, racing, seems all legit.
Well, after Tokyo Drift, it seems like they were just rehashing the same story over and over.
The newer ones are really different though.
I know, and I don't like it. They moved away from racing and more to trafficking.
I guess. They aren't so much just racers now. They are into more criminal acts.
Exactly. I don't really like it.
