What was the most disgusting movie you've ever seen?
Well, this is an interesting topic.
Not what you expected?
Not really what I'd like to talk about.
You must have something in mind.
I do.  For me, Pink Flamingos.
Solid choice, but not the right one.
Okay, smart guy, what would you say?
The Human Centipede.
Hard to argue that one.
Pink Flamingos is only disgusting because of the end.
Well, yeah, that was disgusting, but there was more than that.
Human Centipede was non-stop disgusting all the way.
The very point of the movie is just crazy.
It makes you wonder how these films even get made.
Anything gets made if you've got a producer willing to fork over cash.
That aside, who even thinks of this stuff?
Very twisted individuals in my opinion.
Oh, they made a few Human Centipedes by the way.
Don't remind me.  Makes my heart drop a bit.
