I keep meaning to ask you, what's your favorite Disney movie?
Hands down, got to be Cinderella.
Really?  I love Beauty and the Beast.
In Cinderella I love how the birds get her dressed. Hope I'm remembering that right.
I think you are. I love the music in Beauty and the Beast.
Be our guest! Be our guest!
Have you seen the new version with Emma Watson?
Not yet. I went with my niece to see Moana instead.
Oh, right! That's the one with Wayne "the Rock" Johnson.
It was okay, but Cinderella is still the best.
