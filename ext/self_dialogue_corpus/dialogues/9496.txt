I just could never get into hip hop because I couldn't get past the sound itself.
What do you mean?
Well it's like, not really music. It's a bunch of random sounds thrown together on a loop, I don't hear any skill in it.
I feel differently about that. I feel like that just allows for the skill they do have to be focused more on the lyrics, the construction of them and such.
Then why don't they drop the background noise altogether?
Well there is skill involved in creating a track besides just playing instruments, you know.
And where do they get all their samples anyway?
James Brown, The Temptations, others.. I like hearing black artists represented, you don't see enough of that these days.
I still don't think I could get into it.
Well you don't have to, but you're missing out man.
