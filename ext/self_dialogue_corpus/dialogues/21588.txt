I can't remember the last time I actually sat down to watch a movie.
You mean at home?
No, I mean, we have Netflix. But I meant in the theater.
Oh! Well it's so expensive these days.
What was the last film you saw in the theaters?
The last movie I saw at the theater was Moon.
I can't say I've ever heard of Moon.
It was really bizarre.
Who was in it?
That's just it-- it only had two actors! Kevin Spacey and Sam Rockwell.
Both really talented guys!
Yeah, but Kevin Spacey just voices a robot. Rockwell is the star of the show.
So what happens in it?
Well, I don't want to give it away, but it's totally trippy.
Trippy how? Like A Clockwork Orange?
A little, but it almost plays more like a horror in some ways. Very desolate.
Would you recommend it?
Definitely! It's not really a traditional space movie.
I'll have to look into it!
You should. The score is great, too.
