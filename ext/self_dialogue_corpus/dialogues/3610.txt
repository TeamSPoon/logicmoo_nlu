House of Horror's Emporium.  How can I help you?
HI, I was looking for the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Do you have it in?
Ah, well, let me check.  That was when about...77, 76?
1974.  Long time ago.  Lot of gore for that era.
Oh, yeah, that was in the golden age of blood and body parts.
Well, I'd like to see it again if you guy got it in.  That or The Shining with Jack Nicholson.
Well, let me check here.  No, no looks like Texas Chainsaw is out right now.  Want me to check The Shining?
Yeah, hopefully you have that.  I want something that's really gonna scare me again.  That movie always did that.
Here's Jonny.  Yep got it.  I'll put it behind the shelf for you.
Great. Hey another one of his I might want to see is Wolf.  You got it in?
