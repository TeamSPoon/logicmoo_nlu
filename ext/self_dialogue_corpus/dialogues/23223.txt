Are you a fan of Coen brothers movies?
Absolutely. I loved Fargo.
Yes, that was great. I also liked No Country For Old Men
Oh, that was a good one. Didn't it win Best Picture one year?
Yes, back in 2007.
What were some of the other movies nominated back then?
Juno, Atonement, There Will Be Blood
Oh, There Will Be Blood. I liked that one as well.
I was a bit mixed on it. It seemed a little strange at times.
No way, it was a great telling of the early oil boom.
I heard it was loosely based on Standard Oil's rise to power.
That's what I heard as well.
I thought Daniel Day Lewis did a good job acting in that one.
Yeah, he won a best actor award for that one.
Man, he produces some good work.
Yes he does.
If I remember there was very little blood in that movie.
Yes, not until the very end.
Oh right. The bowling pin.
Yes, the bowling pin to the head.
