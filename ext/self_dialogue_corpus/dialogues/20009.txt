So did you see the latest Katy Perry video?
You mean the one at the amusement park?
No it was after that one.  It's about food.
Wait, wait.  You mean the one about cannibalism?
Ha Ha!  I guess it could be considered that way.
Yeah, I did see it.  Some french name  - like eat up or enjoy
Bon Apetit?
Something like that - it was gross.
Did you like the song?
No, not particularly but I was too busy trying to figure out the video.  That was Katy Perry?
Yeah, can you believe it?
What?  Has she lost her mind?  That was crap!
I did like Chained to the Rhythm - the one in the amusement park.
I loved that song.  After I figured out the messages I sorta enjoyed it less.
What do you mean?
Can't there be one place where we can just enjoy ourselves without all the politics?
Did you know she was heavily into the Clinton bid for election?
Figures, she seems so unhappy about everything.
She did free concerts and announcements.
Bet she didn't like losing.  Probably why she wanted to get a parting shots in her video - like it makes a difference
