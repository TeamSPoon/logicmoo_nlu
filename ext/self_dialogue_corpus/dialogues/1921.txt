Hey, are you excited for this upcoming season?
YES!  I can't wait!
Who is your favorite team?
I love the Indianapolis Colts.
I used to like them, but they god rid of Payton Manning.
Yea, it was a sad time, but we got Andrew Luck.
He seems promising, but still to early to tell.
Well, he has been playing good.  However, time will tell.
How do you think the Colts will do this year?
I think they will end up 10-6.
What did they finish at last year?
I believe their record was 8 - 8.
Did they make the playoffs?
They did not make the playoffs.  They missed it 2 years in a row.
I hope they can turn themselves around.
Me to.  When they had Payton Manning, they never missed a play off.
Do they play a Monday night game at all?
They are currently scheduled for 2 Monday night games.
That will be fun to watch the 2.
It will be a blast!
