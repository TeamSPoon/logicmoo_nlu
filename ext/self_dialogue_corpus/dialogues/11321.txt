I've heard people say the Beatles were the soundtrack to their childhood. What's your thoughts about that
I agree. I was ten when I saw them on ed Sullivan and was completely hooked.
Yea,it seemed they were singing to me
I know. They kind of set us apart from the mainstream
You couldn't wait for the next album and what they were going to teach or tell us
I felt exactly the same
It was such an incredible time in my life
Absolutely! To this day I credit them for guiding me through the sixties.
Ain't that the truth. Peace and Love.
That's what they were about,peace and Love!!
