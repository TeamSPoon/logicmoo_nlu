My son likes Harrison Ford. Did you like the Indiana Jones movies?
Yes they were ok.
Some people say he was good in Star Wars but we never seen Star Wars yet.
Really never?
No. We will have to watch.
Did you watch him in the Fugitive?
Yes my son liked that one.
He was set up and had to go on the run. Tommy Lee Jones was good in that too.
Yes I like Tommy Lee Jones. He was good in No Country for Old Men.
Yes that is a great movie.
