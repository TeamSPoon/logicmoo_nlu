Have you heard the new album from MGK?
MGK? What does that mean?
Machine Gun Kelly
Oh. I do not listen to much hip hop. Is it good?
Yes! I would reccommend it even if you are not a fan.
Where is he from?
Cleveland, OH. Are you familiar with artists from that area?
Not quite. Are there are good features on the album?
Halliee Steinfield is the only one.
How is the song?
Really good! It's actually on the radio.
Oh! I'm very surprised I haven't heard it yet.
What music do you listen to if you do not like hip hop.
I prefer heavy metal, actually.
Oh, ok. Who is your favorite band?
In Flames. Have you heard of them?
Yes, actually! My favorite album is Reroute to Remain.
Mine too! I cannot believe we have that in common.
It is surely a different tune than what we hear in hip hop.
Agreed! What a coincidence!
