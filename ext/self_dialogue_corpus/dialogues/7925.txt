Beyone had a bigger career than anything she did in Destinys Child.
I think Crazy in Love was the apex of her career.
That song was just so good.
Do you think Destinys Child could reunite?
They could and it would make a ton of money.
I dont think she wants to go backwards though
I dont either plus shes survived on her own.
It helped with her husband
So he opened doors?
No I think it was just a boost for her career as well
