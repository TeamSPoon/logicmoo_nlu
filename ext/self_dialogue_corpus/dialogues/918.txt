What is the Raiders situation this year?
In terms of the game, or their off the field issues?
I was looking at more of the off-the-field issues, but interesting to know what they will do on the field as well.
I believe they are still in Oakland again this year and are moving to Las Vegas the year after.
Is that a sure thing? The Las Vegas move?
I think so, last time I checked. Who knows, though, things could have changed.
Kind of sad to see them leave Oakland again.
Yes, that would be the second time they left. I bet the fans will be furious.
Their fans are furious and passionate to begin with. Wonder how they would handle this?
Probably with riots on the streets and inside the stadium.
Wouldn't surprise me. How do you think they'll do on the field.
They are still either the second or third best team in the AFC with Derek Carr back.
I could see that. They definitely have a good balance on offense and defense.
It was a shame that Carr got hurt last year. They had a chance to beat New England, I believe.
Would have been a good matchup. They probably would have given New England a better game than the Steelers did.
Anybody could have. Steelers went into New England and things went south quickly.
Wonder what would happen if they won the Super Bowl this year and then moved out.
Difficult to tell. Wonder if the fans would be more behaved and send them off on a good farewell or even be more infuriated.
I would guess infuriated. Those Raiders fans are crazy.
They are definitely the craziest in the NFL.
