Did you hear there is a new Frozen movie coming out?
I know I can hardly wait.
My daughter is so excited.
Mine too.
Honestly I am excited to see something new
I know I have watched the first about 5000 times
It will be great to hear some new songs
Yes it will.
We will have to get the girls together to watch it.
Its a date.
