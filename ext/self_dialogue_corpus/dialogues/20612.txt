I've been watching so much TV recently, haven't seen a movie in a long while. Is there anything good out right now?
Oh I'm the same way. The only time I really go to the movies is when there's something that you need to see on a big screen.
Like big blockbuster stuff?
Yeah. That method hasn't really let me down. So I saw a couple of movies in the last month, and they were dope.
Which ones?
First I saw the Guardians of the Galaxy sequel.
Oh! How was that?
It was sweet.
How'd it compare to the first one?
Eh, it wasn't quite as good. But it was still really entertaining.
I definitely liked how the first one didn't take itself too seriously.
This one's the same way. But yeah, not exactly as good as the first one.
Okay I'll check that one out. What was the other one you saw?
Wonder Woman.
People keep raving about that. How was it?
Well I don't know. I'm really sick of superhero movies to be honest.
Same. But was it worth watching though?
If you don't care that it's a superhero movie, it's one of the best ones I've ever seen.
It's cool too that it's pretty feminist. Okay, I'll check those two out. Thanks for the recommendations.
No problem. I'll let you know what else I see.
