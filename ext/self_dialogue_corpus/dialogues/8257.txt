What do you think of modern pop music?
I think it all sounds the same.
Couldn't say that about pop music when we were kids?
Yeah, but todays music is all computer generated.
I'm so glad they quit using auto-tune.
They still use it but no like in that T-Pain style anymore.
I like some of the pop music but most of it is garbage to me.
It really does seem disposable.
What do you mean disposable.
The songs aren't songs that 3 to 6 months you will even remember.
