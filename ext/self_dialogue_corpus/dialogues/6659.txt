Can Disney make one movie that isn't awesome?
I know! I feel like everything they make is good.
I used to think they could not replicate their old films, but then Frozen came out.
I know. The Little Mermaid was my favorite.
Those old movies were great! They defined my childhood!
Me too - now I am still watching the new ones because they are so good!
Agreed - our kinds have it really good with the new Disney films.
I wonder if they would make a more mature film.
They could, but no need with the success they have in the children's genre.
I can't wait to see what they come up with next!
