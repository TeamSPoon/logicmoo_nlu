I'm surprised about how many football players go broke or declare bankruptcy when their careers are over.
Sometimes it;s due to bad investments.
Dan Marino is a good example of that.
Isn't he a former quarterback for the Miami Dolphins?
Yes. He played 17 seasons for them.
How did he go broke?
He had invested a lot of money in a company that filed bankruptcy.
So he lost all of his investment.
Exactly and similar situations have happened to other players.
I know of another reason.
What's that?
Having too many kids.
What are you talking about?
Travis Henry was a running back who played for the Bills, Titans and Broncos.
The name isn't ringing a bell, but tell me what happened.
He fathered at least 11 children by 10 different women and owed child support for 9 of the kids.
So he wasn't paying his child support?
No and he owes 170,000 dollars a year for it.
Most people don't even make that much a year.
Now you know why he's broke.
