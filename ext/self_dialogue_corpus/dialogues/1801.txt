Who do you think is the best team in the NFC East this upcoming season?
The Eagles!
Are you kidding me? You have to be joking?
I'm just pulling your leg. No way the Eagles even make the playoffs this season.
I wouldn't go that far.
I would. Carson Wentz is a dud. He can not carry that team to a winning record much less the playoffs.
You may be right. He looked inconsistent last season. So who do you really think is the best in the NFC East?
Anyone paying attention knows it's the Cowboys.
The Cowboys? Really? Aren't they all rookies?
Yeah they are a young team but they have some real talent.
I did watch some of there games and have to admit they looked pretty good.
They are trending up and I only expect the team to be better this year!
I would have to agree but what about the Giants?
They are always a threat every season.
Eli Manning is getting old but their offense has the ability to win games.
Dallas really had no answer for them last season and expect more of the same this upcoming season.
Do you think Dallas can beat the Giants at all this upcoming season?
I predict that they will split the games with each team winning one a piece.
Close games?
For sure! There will be no blow outs in either of the two match-ups.
