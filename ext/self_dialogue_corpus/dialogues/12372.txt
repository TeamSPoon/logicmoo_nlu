So, you remember the climax of Return of the Jedi?
Where Vader picks up the Emperor and throws him down that shaft?
Yeah.  Here's something I find weird... I've heard different explanations for that big explosion of blue energy.
Really?
Yeah, some of the books say it happened because the Emperor was full of Dark Side energy and all, so that when someone like that dies the energy explodes outward.
Weird, don't remember that happening when Darth Maul was killed.  Or Count Dooku for that matter...
Yeah, true, that's one confusing aspect.  But you know what i always thought?
What's that?
I figured the explosion because his body hit some kind of  energy reactor.   After all, the explosion is the same blue color as reactor thing down at the very bottom of the shaft.
Huh, that theory makes me sense to me than the whole Dark Side thing. But, then again, the color is also the same as the Force Lightning the Emperor was torturing Luke with..
