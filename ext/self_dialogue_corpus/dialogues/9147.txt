So my parents went to a Pink Floyd concert tonight.
Actual Pink Floyd or a tribute band?
Not sure.  I just know that they'll be home super late.
Pink Floyd is an interesting band for sure.  They sure indulged in some unusual activities.
I already know where you're going with that, but I doubt my parents will be interested.
I'm not knocking them.  I like listening to them in the background while I work on homework.
Really?  I didn't know that.
Yeah.  I like the instrumental stuff.
Sounds like we should have gone tonight instead of kicking around this place.
Not with your parents though.  I'm too cool for that.
