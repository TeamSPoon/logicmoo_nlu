What did you think of the movie Beauty and the Beast.
I love that movie.
Did you see they came out with a new one?
Yes, I did. I really love the animated one though.
I saw the new one last week.
Wow was it?
Excellent. Josh Groban played the Beast.
He has a great singing voice.
He does, you should go see it.
I will this weekend.
