I just watched my favorite Disney movie ever!
What was it?
Big Hero 6!
Aww, Baymax.
He is just so great and cuddly. I want my own Baymax.
But when the brother died I cried so much.
That was so sad. I wasn't expecting it.
He was such a good guy and then the guy he went in to save wasn't even in need of help.
That made me so mad!
He died for nothing.
