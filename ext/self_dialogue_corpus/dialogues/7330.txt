You know what, I think Cinderella is massively overrated.
Me too, but everyone seems to love it.
It's so derivative and almost anti-feminist.
Yeah you're so right. I always hated how Cinderella's life was doomed until the handsome prince whisked her away.
Also what's with the ugly people being bad. That's giving a terrible message to kids.
The ugly people?
Yeah, Cinderella's ugly stepsisters were horrible to her.
Her wicked stepmother was no spring chicken either.
That being said though, how pretty was her ball gown!
Oh so pretty indeed, but glass slippers would have been a nightmare to wear.
