So what kind of music do you listen to?
Mostly Eighties pop and country.
Why? When they're putting out so much good music today?
There are some modern songs I like.
Like what?
I like "Call Me, Maybe."
COnsidering you're a man, that's a little weird.
Hey, I also like that song from the Disney movie "Frozen."
Which one? We can build a snowman?
No! Don't be silly. "Let it go!"
You like Let it go?
Yes, I do. I have it saved on my phone.
That's kinda... weird.
I know. My wife laughs at me too. I told her, I think I'm turning into a twelve year old girl.
So, what else do you like? What about rap and hip-hop?
I have no use for rap, hip or hop.
None of it?
Very little of it. I liked some of the early stuff. I love Bobby's Brown's "Roni" album. I like Gangsta's Paradise and I'm sure there are others.
Okay, if not rap and hip-hop what about more modern things?
Oh, I like "Bitch" by Alannis Morrisette. And a couple other songs.
