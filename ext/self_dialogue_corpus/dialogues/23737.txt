Do you have any favorite actors?
I'd definitely say that Will Smith is up there.
For me, too! What movie of his is your favorite.
If it's not the Bad Boys series, it's definitely the Men in Black series.
The Men in Black movies are always a fun watch.
Yeah! The dynamic between Smith's and Tommy Lee Jones' characters makes for some classic comedy bits.
Same for Bad Boys, really.
True. He and Martin Lawrence have such great chemistry in that movie!
I don't think I can possibly get through Bad Boys II without at least cracking a smile, it's so funny!
He's got some other great movies out there, too. I'm personally a huge fan of Hancock.
I also liked that movie. A different take on a superhero, and Smith's acting was fantastic.
I also really liked Shark Tale.
That's a kids' movie!
Not true. It's a great family movie with great voice acting in it by Smith and so many other great actors.
I know, I was just kidding! Back to his movies, though, I also really liked Independence Day.
For what it was, it was a solid film.
For the time, the special effects were amazing.
This is true, but it's not like it was that long ago.
You're right. The late 90s were fairly recent.
Yeah, and a lot of movies with great special effects were coming out then.
