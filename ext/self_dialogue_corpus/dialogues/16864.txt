Earlier today I was thinking about how so many TV shows have had great theme songs.
Like the theme song for Doctor Who.
That;s a really good one.
I love the theme song from the original Batman TV show.
How about the theme song from The Green Hornet?
Wasn't that by Al Hirt?
It was.
That was a really good version of the song.
I like Thank You For Being a Friend from the Golden Girls.
I don't think I know that one.
What about the song from Bonanza?
I know that from when I visited the Ponderosa Ranch in Lake tahoe.
The Flintstones theme song was fun as well as The Jetsons.
A real classic is The Brady Bunch.
I think everyone knows that song
Don't forget the X Files song.
That's a creepy one.
For current TV shows, I would say the theme from Hawaii 5 O is really good.
That's a favorite of mine.
It's a real high energy song.
