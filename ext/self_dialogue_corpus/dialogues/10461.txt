I heard a great new song today.
Oh really? Which one?
"Holding On" by The War on Drugs.
I love that band, I didn't know they had a new song out.
It was just released this morning.
Awesome, so does this mean a new album is on the way as well?
Yes, it's called "A Better Understanding".
Terrific news! Any word on when it will be coming out?
The album will be released on August 25.
I can't wait! Their last album was so good.
I know, it had a nostalgic throwback sound but still sounded contemporary.
Yeah, some clear Dire Straits and Tom Petty influences, but distinct at the same time.
Have you heard any good new music lately?
I think my favorite new song is "Fool's Errand" by Fleet Foxes.
Good pick, they sound as good as ever.
Yeah, I'm just thrilled that they're back from their hiatus.
And their album is out soon, right?
Yes, on June 16.
Awesome - it seems like this summer will be a great one for music.
I can't wait to check out some shows!
