Do you think Disney will ever make another Inside Out movie?
I hope so. That movie was hilarious.
The imaginary friend cracks me up every time.
You mean Bing Bong? I forget the actor who voiced him.
His name is Richard Kind. He used to be on that TV show Spin City.
He's funny. That was a good casting choice for Bing Bong.
I think they did a good job on all the characters, to be honest.
I agree. Who was the gentleman that voice Anger?
That would be Lewis Black. He's a comedian.
He's great. He's my favorite Inside Out character.
