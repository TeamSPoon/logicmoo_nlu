I was listening to some songs from Vanessa Carlton the other day.
I don't know if I know that artist. What are her popular songs?
You know her. She sings the one that goes "making my way downtown..."
Oh, I know that song! It's called A Thousand Miles.
Yeah, I love her piano playing in it!
I didn't know she was playing the piano. Does she do that in a lot of her songs?
Yeah, a lot of her songs incorporate her playing the piano.
I wonder if she writes the music too.
I don't know, but I think she does. The clear piano really adds something to songs.
I agree, I've liked it ever since I heard it in old music when I was a kid.
What kind of old music?
There was this Elvis song on my mom's Elvis Top Hits CD that had some really good piano in it.
Elvis, huh? What song was it?
It was called His Latest Flame. I used to get it stuck in my head all the time when I was little.
I don't remember that one. I know a lot of Elvis songs, but piano never really stood out to me in them.
What was your favorite Elvis song?
I love Jailhouse Rock. That song always made me laugh and I would sing it with my brothers.
I haven't heard that song in ages. Now I need to listen to it.
I heard it when I was going through my oldies albums, in between The Beach Boys and The Beatles.
Now those are some classics, especially Hey Jude from The Beatles.
