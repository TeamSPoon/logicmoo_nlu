Hey, have you seen the movie Deadpool?
No, but I'm a little familar with it. Could you fill me in a little more?
Well, Deadpool is the story of Wade Wilson, aka Deadpool aka the Merc with the Mouth.
Merc with the Mouth?
Becuase Deadpool constantly wisecracks and even breaks the fourth wall to talk directly to the audience.
Okay, gotcha. How about some more plot details.
Well, Wade is a mercernary who has a bit of a heart, and tends to work for the little guy.
Okay, so what happens.
He meets a hooker named Vanessa and they fall madly in love with each. But then, things go wrong.
How so?
Wade is diagnaosed with terminal cancer and takes an offer to not only be cured, but recieve super powers as well.
Okay, but I take there is a downside.
Yes, not only will he suffer excuriating pain, but then he'll be sold to the higgest bidder as slave soldier.
That sucks, so does he avoid that fate.
Yes, he escapes after developeing regeneration abilites that make him unkillable. Hence, his name.
Deadpool?
Because if you bet on him to die, like in a deadpool gambling set-up, you'll aways lose.
So what happens next?
He goes on a revenge kick, hunting down the people who changed him, so he get his face, disfigured by his powers, fixed and get his girl back.
Okay, sound different. I'll try to make time to watch it.
