have you listened to Justin Beiber's new song?
which song are you referring to?
the one he sings in Spanish! its really catchy!
yes, i have heard that one! i think its called Despacito!
That's the one! i love the beat and the lyrics are really catchy!
i have no idea what they are saying
me either, but i think its something about a relationship.
that makes sense. i do know that despacito means "slowly" in spanish.
maybe its about taking the relationship slowly?!
maybe! either way i still love the way it sounds!
and its really great to dance to too!
I think he may be on to a new style of music.
i agree, it is very popular, and i could see it really catching on!
maybe he will make more songs like it in the future.
i sure hope so!
i will be the first one to buy it on itunes!
maybe he will release a new album!
that would be amazing! especially if its all in spanish too!
ill start learning spanish just so i can understand his songs.
haha, thats some true motivation!
