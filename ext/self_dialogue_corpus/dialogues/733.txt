When can kids sign up for football?
I think when they are about 8 years old.
Today kids are starting younger and younger.
I know that kids are starting soccer at 4 years old.
Wow, I wonder if bodies can handle football at such young ages.
Well, a big topic is concussions.
I wonder how many football players have had concussions?
I don't know.  Good question.
Do their helmets protect them?
I don't know, but it seems like they still get concussion despite having helmets.
Some hits are really hard.
Football is a dangerous sport.
I guess all sports and activities can be dangerous.
Yeah, you get good physical exercise from football.
I just don't know if it is worth the risk.
I don't want my boys to play football.
It is dangerous.
I hope that my boys pick a different sport.
Me too.  I just can't take the stress of watching the rough sport.
If only they had better protection from injury it would be fun.
