I just watched Get Out. Have you seen it?
Yeah, I watched it about a month ago. Did you like it?
I thought it was overrated. Don't get me wrong, it was good. But not as good as I was expecting.
Why do you say that? What was wrong with it?
It was really slow.
Oh yeah. I can understand why you would say that.
There was a good amount of time in the first half where nothing really happened.
Well, I think that's because the writer was building it up.
Yeah, but that made it really boring.
True. But the ending was good.
Yeah, once it picked up it got really good.
I didn't expect it to be what it was. I thought it was going to be more like Stepford Wives.
Me too! I expected them to turn the people into robots.
I think Jordan Peele is a good writer and director. I can't wait to see what he comes out with next.
I believe he said he was going to make more horror movies.
I wish he'd make a comedy. I really liked Keanu.
The movie about the lost cat?
Yeah, that was funny.
It was! I wasn't expecting it to be so good.
Me either. It was a surprise.
