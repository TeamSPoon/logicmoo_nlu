Is Lady Madonna the best song on Hey Jude?
No I dont think so by a long shot.
So what do you prefer?
The song Hey Jude for starters.
OK outside of what that track is, what do you expect from it?
Dont let me down is my personal favorite.
How did you feel about the album as an overall sound?
You can tell they didnt record together.
The mixing was great.
I mean the producer worked wonders. But you can tell this was disheveled.
