I think it may be time to change the rules in NFL Football.
What? Why? I think things are going pretty well these days.
They are, but having some new rules and scoring opportunities may put some more excitement into the games.
In what way?
So, they got rid of tie games a few years back, but I think there could be a better way to score points in field goals.
Okay, I'll bite.  How would you change it?
Well, since it's a lot harder to hit a field goal from further back in the field, I think it would be cool to add in more points on longer field goals.
That might be interesting.
So, for instance, field goal points could start at the 30 yard line with 1 point, then 40 yards with 2 points, 50 with 3 points and so on.
So, in the new point system, there could be a lot more field goal kicking?
Yes, this would definitely change the game from a ground game (pass or running play) to more of a skill game for the kickers.
I could see the kickers becoming as important as the quarterbacks in your scenario.
Yes, can you imagine if a game came down to a field goal?
Yes, I can see it now.  Time running out on the clock and the team has to make a choice as to how to handle it.
And because it's a close game, the offensive team might opt to kick a field goal.
Versus doing a Hail Mary pass, that might make a lot of sense.
Can you imagine the pressure on the kicker if the team runs a field goal play?
Scoring might be a big pain, though.
But I do think that it would lend a lot of subtle strategy... Maybe, someday, the NFL will make the change.
Until then, the teams should continue to practice a Hail Mary pass.
