Hey, did you hear that new rap song?
No, I have taste in music and don't listen to rap.
Why not? Rap and hip/hop are the voice of oppressed people.
When all of the music turns positive, stops demeaning women, other blacks, and quits making up social issues to talk about, I'll consider it.
If you just listen to the lyrics, you'll come away with a much better understanding. The lyrics are deep.
Please. I could put Dr. Seuss's "Green Eggs and Ham" to a rap beat and have a platinum selling album.
You know what it says about you if you don't like rap and hip hop?
Yeah, like I said before, it means I have a good taste in music.
Whatever.
Thanks. Try listening to some Rush. THOSE are deep lyrics.
