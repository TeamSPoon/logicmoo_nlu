Which Star Wars movie do you like best?
My favorite is still the original!
Yeah, that's still a great movie.
I love the introduction of Han Solo in the cantina!
Yes, but I hate that they changed the scene in the special edition.
Absolutely. Han shot first, and that's how it should be.
It's also great to see Leia and Luke for the first time.
Yeah, Luke is so young when the first movie starts!
And it's still a great scene when the Death Star blows up.
I hold my breath every time, even though I know the good guys are going to win.
