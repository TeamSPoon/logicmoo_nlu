Did you see that the Sabres hired a new GM?
Yea, I hope he is better than Tim Murray.
I think that Nashville will win it all this year.
I think that too.
I think Jack Eichel will win MVP this year.
He has a pretty good chance if he can stay healthy.
I think Sidney Crosby needs to retire.
Me too, he has to consider his health.
I think that the Penguins over achieved this year.
Me, too, they are not as good as they look.
did you see the that the Capitals were eliminated?
Yea, they were a let down this series.
I think that Alexander Ovechkin is overrated.
He definitely was this year.
I was surprised that the Black hawks did not do better in these playoffs.
They were due for a bad year.
I hope that the Anaheim Ducks and Nashville Predators have a competitive series.
I hope so too, and I think that they will.
i hope that the Sabres can play better next year.
I think that they will.
