Summer training is about to start. Are you ready for football
Yes! I can't wait for another season!
What is your favorite part about NFL?
I love all the tailgating and parties to watch.
Yeah. There is always great food at those events.
Don't forget there is never a shortage of drinks!
Very true. It is also cool to see everyone come together to cheer on their team.
Even the die hards, ticking with their team even during loosing streaks
Yeah. The are the true fans.
Not the bandwagon fans
I also like watching the commercials during the games
Those can be really funny.
Any plan for going to games this year?
Yeah, I already have tickets for 3 home game, and an away one.
Good excuse to get away for a weekend.
Yeah, very. It is a surprise for my boyfriend.
Is he a big NFL fan?
Yes. Huge fan.
Very nice. He will enjoy that.
I hope so!
