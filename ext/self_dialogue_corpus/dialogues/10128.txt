Hey, what was the movie where the guy went on a rampage after his dog got killed?
I think you are thinking of John Wick.
Yep, that's the one!
Have you seen it yet?
I was thinking about it. Is it good?
Yeah it's fantastic.
What's so good about it?
There's a vast underground world of assassins which John Wick has to navigate and interact with.
Oh that does sound fun. Are the fight scenes good?
Yeah, the action scenes are some of the best i've ever seen.
