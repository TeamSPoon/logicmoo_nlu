James and the Giant Peach was one of my favorite books
I know, I was so happy when the movie came out.
I felt so bad for how James was treated though.
I know, I was thinking about how he had lost his mom and dad and now he is being abused.
I wonder if that peach tasted good being that it was so big.
I know, also because it had giant bugs all through it
I liked how he lived in the peach seed in the end, that was neat.
right in the middle of the city also!
I was glad that he got away from his horrible aunts.
so was I , he deserved to be happy.
