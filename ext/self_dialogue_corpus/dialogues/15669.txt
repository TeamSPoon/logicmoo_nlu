I hate it when people denigrate any one particular genre of music, like it's worthless or something.
Yeah, just because you don't like something doesn't mean it's necessarily bad.
And just because you like metal or folk or rap or whatever doesn't mean that is the be-all-end-all only decent music on earth.
I know. Musical elitism is incredibly annoying.
Pop music in particular gets a bad rap.
It's true. People forget how much of what can be considered essential now, was looked down upon as teeny-bopper pop at the time.
Yeah, like The Beatles. And let's not forget how many classic pop songs are still being made.
It's true.
I really feel like you can't really claim to be a music lover and then turn around and flat out dismiss an entire genre.
Or several genres.
Absolutely. The world needs pop and rap and rock and country and classical and whatever else you can think of in equal measure.
Having them all around leads to them influencing each other, and possibly creating the next big thing.
If we just listened to the same thing over and over it would get incredibly boring.
Absolutely.
Of course, that being said, I really can't bring myself to listen to death metal or anything like that.
Oh no, me neither.
I am not saying it's awful, or shouldn't exist, but it really just isn't for me.
Right, of course. I feel the same way about really hardcore gangsta rap.
Oh yeah me too. And really twangy country singers.
Yeah, right. Of course.
