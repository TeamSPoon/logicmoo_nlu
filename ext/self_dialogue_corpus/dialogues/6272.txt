What's your favorite Disney movie of all times??
I would have to say the Lion KIng. Simba was so adorable.
Yes, I love that movie. I still cry every time.
I really want to see the new Beauty & the Beast.
Oh isn't that girl from Harry Potter in it?
Yes, I think it looks good. I need to see Frozen, I haven't seen that one yet.
I really love the classics like Cinderella and 101 Dalmations.
I remember having the VHS tapes with the heavy duty plastic cases.
Oh I think they might be worth money now a days.
I sold them all at a garage sale, I'm going to check on eBay to see how much they're worth.
