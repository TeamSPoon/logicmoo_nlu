So what would be one of your favorite Disney movies of all time?
I would have to say the Toy Story movies are definitely some of favorites.
Those were great. Didn't they make several of them?
Yes. They made three of them..
I wonder if they'll ever make another one.
Actually, Toy Story 4 is scheduled for summer of 2019.
Oh, wow. I wonder if Tom Hanks will do the voice of Woody again.
He is, apparently.
Cool. Do you have any idea what it's suppposed to be about?
Apparently Woody and Buzz Lightyear go on a search for Bo Peep, who was given away.
