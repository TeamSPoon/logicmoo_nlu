Have you ever seen the Texas Chainsaw Massacre?
I've seen a couple of them.
Which ones did you see?
I'm not sure.  I was younger and really into horror back then.
You aren't now?
Not so much.  I think I'd cringe to see limbs being sawed off.
You could watch it with no problem then though?
Pretty much.  It was terrifying and I loved it.
Weren't the movies based on a true story?
I think they were very loosely based on a number of stories.
