Which is the best Back to the Future?
Tough question.  My favorite is 2, but would I like it so much without the first one?
So, part of why you like it so much is because it calls back to the first one?
Exactly.  What is the best Karate Kid movie?
I don't know if I could pick between the first and second one.  Both are really good.  Do you know what I don't get?  Why Ghostbusters 2 gets so much hate.
Yeah, I thought it was just as good as the first one, and in some cases better.  I love Jackie Wilson.
What are some other movies with good soundtracks?
I love the soundtrack from both Guardians of the Galaxy movies.
Both excellent soundtracks.  I really like the soundtrack from Blow.
That one has some good tunes.  I like soundtrack from Reservoir Dogs.
Another good one-- who will ever forget Stuck in the Middle with You during that scene with Michael Madsen?
I really like the Grease soundtrack, which is a musical, so the music had better be good.
The soundtrack from Almost Famous is absolutely amazing.
Agreed, and on that note, Across the Universe's soundtrack is great.
I really like the music in Boogie Nights, too.
What is your favorite song in a film scene moment?
I really like in Revenge of the Nerds when We are the Champions starts playing at the end.  You?
In Rocky 2, when Adrian tells Rocky to win for her, and the bell rings to start the training montage.
The right music choices can make a good movie great.
Totally agree with you on that.
