Hey let's go see eh new Star Wars movie.

the 9 pm show
nah I can't
why
my wife has me doing house work all evening
Why don't you bring her with you?
You won't mind?
She's more than welcome
But her sister is also in town
She's welcome to come along as well
But you shoudl know that her sister doesn't like sci-fi
Well that's okay we can do another movie
how about a romantic comedy
great Idea
