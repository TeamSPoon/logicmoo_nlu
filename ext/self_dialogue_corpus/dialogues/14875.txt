Do you want to go see Dispicable Me 3 this weekend.
Yes, I loved the other two, I can't wait to see this one.
I know, I saw a movie review on the news a feew days ago.  He's got a new enemy named Balthazar Bratt.
Oh yeah, who's voicing him?
Trey Parker actually.
As in South Park creator Trey Parker?
Yup, It should be amazing to have him play a villain.
Yeah, rotten tomatoes gave it a pretty good review.
How could they not with such a good cast.
I don't know, but it doesn't matter, I'd still go and laugh my face off.
