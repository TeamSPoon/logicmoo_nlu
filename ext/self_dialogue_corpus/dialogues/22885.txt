What is the most disappointing movie you can recall from recent memory?
This may be a random one to you, but I would have to go with "88 Minutes", with Al Pacino.
I think I have heard of that one but please fill me in.
It's a very basic plot. Al Pacino plays a psychiatric therapist, who receives a threatening phone call claiming that he was but 88 minutes to live.
Sounds like it could actually be interesting.
Unfortunately, the movie is filled with plot holes and some bad acting.
That's a shame. What is the general idea?
Well, after Pacino receives the call, he feels the need to crack the case on his own, using all of his skills and knowledge.
But he does not play a cop, right? He just works for them?
Sort of, yes. He is definitely not a cop, but has several ties to the FBI in the film.
So if his life in threatened, why wouldn't he just sit out at a police station?
Because what is the fun in that? In all seriousness, logically, that's what I think most would do.
Feel free to spoil the movie if you like. Since it is apparently quite bad.
I won't give every little bit of detail away, but I think the person behind is pretty obvious.
Is there a big twist involved?
No, not really. It honestly presents itself as if it were a "Who done it?"
Did you think it was doomed from the start?
I don't think so. I think a movie like this could have been great but fell very short.
That's a shame, because Al Pacino is one of the greatest actors of all time.
I completely agree and I do think he is better than this!
