Did you catch the Grammys this year?
Yeah, it was pretty messed up!
I know! That thing with Metallica and Lady Gaga!
I must have missed that part...
You knew they would be perfoming together, yes?
Yeah I had heard.
Well James Hetfield microphone wasn't on.
No way! What happened?
I'm not sure what went wrong, but you could only hear Gaga for the first little bit.
Did the mike come back on?
No, Hetfield shared the Ladies mike.
Oh, Man!
Yeah, It was pretty bad.
How'd Hetfield take it.
Not very well.
Oh, yeah?
After the song he threw his guitar back stage.
Ha!
Yeah, really chucked it.
Man, I'll have to look that up!
