I was really surprised when Carrie Fisher died.
Me too. It was very sad.
I wonder if she will be in any of the rest of the movies.
I think they have filmed some scenes but they will have to do a lot of rewriting.
That's a shame I really liked seeing the old characters interact with the new ones.
They can still concentrate on Han Solo and Luke Skywalker.
Yes and well that's good it won't be quite the same.
The original movies were the best.
Yes I appreciate what they're trying to do but sometimes the storyline is too diluted.
I know the ones that concentrate on the senate are kind of boring.  More action less talking.
