What was the best light saber duel?
Without a question, it would go to Anakin and Obiwan's duel
That duel had more riding on it
Their duel in episode IV had some of the same feeling
After seeing episode III, you could tell Obiwan only lost the second time because of his age
It was one of the saddest deaths in the movies
Obiwan's death was put there to help develop Luke as a character, for theatrical purposes as well
It showed not everyone in the Empire was incompetent
Yes, it showed how much Luke improved over the original trilogy
Obiwan seemed like a much stronger Jedi when you see the full story
