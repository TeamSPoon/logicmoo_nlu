Have you heard of Ratatat?
Yeah they are one of my favorite bands!
When I hear my music, I feel like I am in heaven
I love all of their music!
Do you have a favorite album?
I really like LP3
It was such a great album!
All the songs were still very Ratatat like but new too
Do you have any favorite songs?
I really liked Shempi and Mirando
I loved Mirando, but not so much Mirando
All of the songs were good but not all were great
Yeah, honestly some can get boring but others are good forever!
One time I listened to Loud Pipes by Ratatat for a week straight
I did that with Wildcat!
Is that the song with the roar sounds throughout the song?
Yeah that's it. I really liked it but I always forget the name
Have you heard their newer album LP4?
When did that come out? Maybe it's not soo old
It came out in 2010, so it's already 7 years old!
