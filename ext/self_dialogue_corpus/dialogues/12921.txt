How come you never see Leia use the force?
Yeah, i've always wondered that. I mean her brother and father were both powerful force users, and yet she never uses it.
I thought I read that she has the power to use the force but just chooses not to.
Hmm, that makes sense, but still I don't fully understand why she doesn't. It probably could have helped in the war against the Empire.
Yeah, I had hoped for some dialogue related to her reluctance to use the force in the last movie, "Force Awakens", but no, nothing.
She was called a general in that movie though, so she was still very much in the war efforts, just not as a Jedi.
And then her son, Ben, turns all Sith and joins the dark side. That had to have factored into her reasons to stay away from the call of the force, don't you think?
Yeah, I would think so. I mean, her dad is dead, her brother ran away and her son is evil. I can see why she doesn't want anything to do with the force now, but still doesn't explain the past.
Guess we'll never know. I'm sure she had her reasons though.
I wonder if there's any fan fiction about that topic? I should look that up when I get home.
