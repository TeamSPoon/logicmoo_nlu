I am writing a play about vampires and I am looking for good music
Oh, I love vampires, and the dark music is so sexy
I know I need it to be dark, and I am used to softer music and I am drawing a blank
I can play you some songs and you ca see how you feel
Really? That would be amazing
this is my personal favorite, its from Disturbed, its called forsaken
Holy cow, that is perfect
The next is Korn, the name is System
These are perfect, I have chills
The theme song to vikings would be great too
Do you have a name?
If I Had a Heart
Oh yes, love it
When is your play?
Next spring, there is a lot that goes into it
I would be happy to find more music for you
You are the best friend I ever had
Thank you
I have to run
Ok, talk to you later
