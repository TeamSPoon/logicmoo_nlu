This should be very exciting. Don't you think?
I think will be.
I think the Panthers will go back to the Super Bowl this year. Who do you think will go?
I think it will be the Patriots this year and they will win
Yea but Tom Brady is getting close to retiring.
Yeah and hes trying to get more rings before then.
That's very true but as long as he stays healthy.
I think he will.
Who is your favorite player? Mine is Luke Kuechly.
Mine is Antonio Brown.
He is a really good player and he might get the MVP this year.
I think he is a good candidate for that.
Who do you think is the best defense in the NFL? I think it is the Cowboys.
I think it is the Steelers.
I think the Cowboys have the best offense too. What do you think?
I think they have a good offense but the best offense is the Panthers.
That is very close but its hard to choose between the two.
Yea but the Panthers are just a little better than the Cowboys.
I dont know. I wish they could play in the Super Bowl against each other.
Yeah that would be a good game
