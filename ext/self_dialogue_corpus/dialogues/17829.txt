Have you heard of the Japanese band, Toe?
Toe?
It's a post-rock band. Or maybe a math rock band. I don't really understand the difference.
Me either.
Anyway, they're really interesting. I've been listening to their music all day.
What do you like about it?
Well, it's really calm. So it's easy to work to.
That's a plus.
But also, if you want to listen, it's complicated enough that it's interesting on its own.
There aren't many bands that can do that.
Yeah. It's a quality I'm more used to seeing in classical music.
I've actually been listening to a lot of renditions of Chopin's nocturnes lately.
Should I check those out?
They have a lot of the qualities you were just talking about.
Hmm. Maybe I'll give them a shot.
Are you very into classical music?
I've always wanted to be, but I've never known where to look.
You should also try some Liszt.
Okay, I will.
I'm pretty sure you'll enjoy it!
