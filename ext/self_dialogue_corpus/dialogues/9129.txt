Do you like Avenged Sevenfold?
Yes! They are my all-time favorite band!
What's your favorite song by them?
I'd have to say "Critical Acclaim" and "God Damn". Both are really heavy songs and that's what I like!
Coolness! I am a big fan of them too.
I also love Disturbed!
Oh me too! I love "The Sound of Silence". Best song ever!
Yes and not just that song, everything by Disturbed is awesome!
I'll have to agree with you there.
I think they should've won about 1,000 awards for "The Sound of Silence" though!
