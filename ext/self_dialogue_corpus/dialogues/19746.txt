What is going on with the soundtracks you here in movies?
Can you elaborate on that?
Sure, like do people still listen to them?
No I dont think its like it used to be.
Do people even download them?
I think its all ignored
Thats nuts I remember when they were huge.
I think they died off in the early 2000s
So it was not viable?
Peoples music interests changed. I dont think its that big of a deal.
I think a good amount of people still do it
Do what?
Want to hear a good soundtrack
I just think the movie dialogue is better
That and they dont need a great soundtrack to boot
They should want to
It helps move a movie along
I would agree with you
Producers should refocus on that.
If it isnt broke dont fix it
