Hey have you seen Hidden Figures yet?
Yes, I think so, but it has been a while.
That was an amazing movie! I loved the historical view of it.
Who were the actors in it again?
Taraji P. He, Octavia Spencer, Janelle Mon√°e were the main women that acted in this film.
The story of those women was amazing, how they helped the space program. No one ever knew much of their names either.
Yes, it was always the astronauts that got the credit, never the people behind them , helping them arrive safely back home.
Those women were some brilliant minded women.
They were extraordinary.
Helping Jon Glenn arrive back home is pretty great.
I think the director Theodore Melfi did an amazing job.
Yes, I felt that I was interested the entire movie, it held my attention.
The box office made $230 million dollars on that movie.
I can imagine they probably got some awards too, it was a great movie.
Maybe we can rent it again and watch it together.
Perhaps Netflix has it?
Maybe, but if not we can get it at Red Box.
Ok, well if you want we can try this weekend?
Sure, I will let you know when I find the movie!
Thanks, see you soon.
