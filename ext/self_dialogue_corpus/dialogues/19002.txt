Did you watch the finals of the van Cliburn piano competition?
I definitely did.
Were you rooting for one pianist in particular?
Well in my heart I wanted the only woman competitor to win, Rachel Cheung.
They were all so great. I really loved her SCHUMANN Kreisleriana, op. 16 in the semi-finals.
I was pulling for Tony Yike Young because he studies with my friend at the conservatory.
Wasn't he the youngest competitor?
I think he's 18, but he plays far beyond his years.
Such power and musicality for one so young.
His  Mussorgsky's Pictures at an Exhibition in the semis was phenomenal.
To make the semi finals at 18 is an accomplishment it itself.
I was glad to see Kenny Broberg win the silver medal.
Me too and I really enjoyed how he played  Rachmaninoff Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini, op. 43 for his final round concerto.
His Schubert Four Impromptus, D. 899, op. 90 was outstanding.
You love that Romantic music era, don't you?
True, but he rocked on the Scriabin Sonata No. 4 in F-sharp Major, op. 30 and you can't call that Romantic Era.
You're right, but notice that all 3 Van Cliburn medalists studied in the United States
It's like the Olympics of Piano, you represent your country of birth.
At least Broberg is from the United States and represented the United States
The gold and bronze medalists represented Canada and South Korea but they studied here. Oh well....all made ,me want to practice pano more.
