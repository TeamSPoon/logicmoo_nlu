Hey Karen do you like comedies. If so what kind?
I like RomComs mostly. Situational comedies are a close second.
Same here! My favorite comedy is You've Got Mail.
Tom Hanks is great in that one. What other comedies you like?
My other all time favorite is My Sassy Girl. What's your all time favorite comedy?
I love Vacation with Chevy Chase and  Beverly D'Angelo. My Sassy Girl...wasn't it a flop?
You're thinking of the 2008 American remake, it was a flop! Try the 2001 original it was a gigantic hit!
Sounds tempting, can I borrow your DVD? I'll swap you another comedy.
What comedy are you going to swap? I'm Mighty picky!
How about my Caddy Shack DVD and Vacation 30th Birthday on Blu-ray? You can keep them for a week too!
