How do you feel about rap music?
It's fine, but it's not my first choice of music if thats what you mean.
What would you choose first?
I don't really have a preference. As long as it sounds good.
Then why do you feel rap isn't your first choice?
Mainly because theres not really a lot of good rap music out there.
What do you mean?
Well most of it is your general nonsense.
Nonsense?
Yeah, No real topic, message or meaning. Its usually about money, getting drunk or high.
Yeah I can kind of see that, so you don't like any of those kinds of songs?
Not really. I'm not saying some of them aren't catchy but they don't really bring anything to the table aside from a good beat.
Now that you mention it I don't think I can recall a good rap song that has some kind of message to it.
Exactly thats why it's not really my thing. I think rock has a much better range of creative talent.
Oh yeah? Who would you recommend?
Pretty much anybody. You have bands like Disturbed, and Metallica that have a great sound and depth to their songs.
When you say depth to their music what would you consider.
Well whether or not I can relate to the song, and if it covers a real life kind of topic.
I think of it as if the song hits me emotionally more than having a story or something.
Well if you think about it, it all boils down to the song getting to you emotionally. You just don't care how which is fine.
