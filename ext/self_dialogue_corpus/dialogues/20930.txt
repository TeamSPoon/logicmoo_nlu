Did you watch the Final Destination movies?
I think I had watched just the first two.
Why only the first two?
It just got old and gory.
Why was it old?  I thought they were exciting.
You knew what was going to happen in everyone.
Not really.
Okay, well you knew who was going to die.
Yeah, you're right on that one.
Yeah, what's the fun if you know that everyone will die?
You didn't know how though.
Well, that's where the gore came in.
Oh, yeah.  They were gory for sure.
So many freak accidents.
Yeah, everyone was getting decapitated.
Yeah, just gory and overkill.
Was that a pun?
I didn't mean it to be.
So you didn't see the one at the race track?
I don't think so.  Wasn't that the third or fourth one?
