What is a really scary movie we could watch?
I really liked Paranormal Activity. It was so creepy.
That's the one about the demon that follows the couple.
Yes. I think those types of movies are so much scarier than bad guy movies.
Why?
Well, a bad guy you can get rid of. An evil ghost though, well, that's a lot harder.
What about Mike Myers? He kept coming back.
True.
I think I'd just rather not be hunted by anything, ghost or human.
I totally agree!
