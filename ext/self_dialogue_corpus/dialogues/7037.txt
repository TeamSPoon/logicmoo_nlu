What is your favorite Disney movie of all time?
I would have to say that my favorite is The Little Mermaid.
I love that one, too. I still remember every word to all of the songs.
I do, too. I always loved the way the underwater creatures interacted with the people.
I know. Scuttle was my favorite character.
Oh, he was so funny! I loved when he made up names for items Ariel had found in her cave.
Yes, and explaining how they are used by the people.
Sebastian was a great character also. He was always ending up in danger while trying to watch out for Ariel.
The scene where he was running from the chef was hilarious!
Yes, it was! The whole movie was wonderful - a true classic.
