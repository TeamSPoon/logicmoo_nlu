You now what kind of movie I want to make?
What?
Historical epic with most detailed research.
Well, that's not an easy are. Historical research is actually pretty tough.
I'll have a team of well educated and anal historians working on it.
For that you need money.
I'll have scores of bored Wall st investment bankers funding it
For that you need a detailed plan and a business model
For that I'll have a business manager work on it.
Just a business manager? What is a business manager? Do you have have a business degree to be a buiness manager? Does the position come with a dental? Retirement account?
A business manager is someone who has a keen business acumen and be able to address the business needs of my vision.
So... you need money to hire this business manager.
Do I?
I woudln't work for free if I was this "business manager." But you need the business manager to talk to the Wall st Bankers for funding. How are... you know what. Nevermind. So historical epic, eh? What time period?
When was Ghengis Kahn? That time.
"Genghis Khan" was born in the 12th century.
That's my time. And the place is Europe.
Holy Roman Empire's defense against the Mogol horde. It wasn't really that bad. Hardly wroth the time to make a movie about it.
How come? How do you know?
Well, for starters, Mongols only got to bhe boundaries of the Holy Roman Empires, but by then Ogedai had died. So the prince leading the invasion Batu, Genghis's grandson had to return home. And The pope at the time called for a crusade against the mongols, but it didn't go over very well. So a movie about Mongols in Europe isn't going to work.
