Another day passes. Another day less until we finally see some football.
I'm so excited to see what all of the teams will do this season.
I really want to see what these rookie and second year quarterbacks can do this season.
Yeah. Guys like Wentz are definitely going to be an interesting watch.
The eagles look like they may have some pretty good weapons this time around so Wentz should flourish.
Anything is better than Agholor.
Wasn't he a top pick and he has absolutely done nothing for them?
If you look him up on YouTube all you find are lowlights. No highlights whatsoever.
I wonder if it's a mental thing or he just doesn't care to better himself.
Those terrible drops hint at it being mental honestly.
What other quarterbacks are you looking into?
I am intrigued by Goff from the Rams.
I know it has only been a year, but he has me worried.
He definitely didn't show very much last season, although his team wasn't top notch.
Gurley was completely ineffective the entire season.
Yeah a rookie quarterback with no running game is almost a guarantee to set them up for failure.
The old saying always goes a quarterback's best friend is a running game.
Definitely. They don't really have top receivers either.
I know they have Tavon Austin, but that's about it.
He could be great with any other team, but he's not really worthy of that contract with a low offensive talented team like the Rams.
