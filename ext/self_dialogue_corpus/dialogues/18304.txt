Techno music is awful.
That's a strong statement.
Not at all.  What's better?
Well, all music quite frankly.
Exactly, that's my point.  It's just loud thrashing.
I don't prefer it myself, but I don't dance.
Some people listen to it casually and don't have to be at a club.
Yeah, but those people have some weird tastes.
Who's the worst artist that does it?
Techno?  Gosh, so many come to mind.
Well, try and pick just one.
For me, I would say Carl Cox.
Popular, but annoying.  I get it.
I would also put Adam Beyer up there as well.  He just plays trash.
You seem to know a lot about artists even though you hate it.
What can I say, I'm a cultured individual.
I would say that this music would be good if you find a girl who likes dancing to it.
Well yeah, but I wouldn't date a girl that listens to techno.
True, it would be a bit odd.
I couldn't handle it.  My ears would fall off!
