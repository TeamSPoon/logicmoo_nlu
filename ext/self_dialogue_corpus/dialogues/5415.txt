I saw Beauty and The Beast, how do you feel about it?
I have not yet acquainted myself with the movie, however I am keeping up with the movie.
When do you think you'll see it, the beauty is really daring with the Beasts in the castle?
I know as I read about it, feeling it would be a good idea at the theater.
The Beast and the beauty's friendliness made them get along.
For sure the beauty has an intelligence.
What would you think to rate the movie unseen? I saw and rated it 5/5
As unseen I will rate it 4/5.
That is a good rating unseen, you might give it 7 out of 5 after you see it.
I am afraid I would not do that.
