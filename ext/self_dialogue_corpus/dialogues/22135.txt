Have you seen the latest X-Men movie?
Is that the one called Apocalypse?
Yes, it is.
I did. I rented it on Netflix.
I saw it in the theater when it came out.
I haven't been to the theater in a long time. It's become an unpleasant experience.
How so?
There are always people talking, or they forget to shut off their phones.
Yeah, that is a problem.
The food is overpriced, and they don't let you bring in outside food or drink.
When I was a kid, my parents used to sneak in soda in their jackets.
I forgot to do that last time. How did you enjoy Apocalypse?
I thought it was rather average.
Me too. I recently had seen Civil War, and that was so good I think it spoiled me.
Yeah, Civil War was great. Apocalypse just didn't hold up.
I think Sony made a mistake releasing it so soon after Civil War.
Yes, no one beats Marvel at their own genre.
Agreed.
I'm glad they're working with Marvel on the new Spider-man.
Me too.
