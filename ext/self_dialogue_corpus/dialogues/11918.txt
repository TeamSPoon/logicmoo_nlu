Who's your favorite Beatle?
It has to be George Harrison. And you?
Paul McCartney. What's your favorite song?
That's a hard one, but I'm going to go with Taxman, because George sang lead on it.
My favorite is the classic, Hey Jude.
I love that one as well. I know somebody who named their kid after the song.
I bet a lot of people have done that.
Did you ever see their rooftop performance? Killer!
Totally! They were one of a kind.
We'll never see or hear anyone like them, that's for sure.
