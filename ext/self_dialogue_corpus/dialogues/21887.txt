Are you into cop movies?
Kinda, I did like Beverly Hills Cop with Eddy Murphy.
Well, would you be into vigilante movies?
Well, I'm not sure. I don't think I've seen any.
Mind if I recommend one to you?
Sure, go ahead.
Well the movie I'm thinking of is called Death Wish.
Wow sounds violent, haha.
Well, it is. There are some gunfights and stuff in it.
What is it about?
Basically the main character's wife and daughter gets raped and brutally beaten.
Oh my god, that sounds horrible.
Yeah, but he decides to avenge them by going out and shooting nasty criminals in the street.
Interesting, does he find the people who did that to his family?
Yeah he does, after a while.
Does he continue to hunt down other criminals?
Yes, most of the movie he just destroys all criminals who cross him.
He sounds like a really tough dude.
Oh, he is. That's what happens when you mess with his family.
Haha, I will have to check that movie out.
