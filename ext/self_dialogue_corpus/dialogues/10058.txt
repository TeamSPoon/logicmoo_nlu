Do you ever watch John Carpenter movies?
Sometimes.
Ghosts of Mars is one that you should watch. It is an action movie with a slight horror twist to it.
Sounds good. Who was in that one?
That had Jason Statham in it.
I like him.
Was it a fairly recent movie?
Yes, it came out in 2001.
Who else was in it?
Of all people Ice Cube was in it.
