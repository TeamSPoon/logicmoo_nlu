Hey, you gonna see the new Fast and Furious movie?
What number is this again? Seveteen? Fifty-six?
Seven, I think.
Ha! You're a fan and you don't even know.
I don't care what number it is. They're good movies. Except for maybe Tokyo Drift.
I'm surprised you even wanna see this new movie. That Paul guy isn't in it.
Hey! It's getting really good reviews. I'll give it a chance. So you wanna go with me?
uh.. I"ll think about it.
I have this feeling that if you see this one, you'll become a fan. Have you seen any of them?
I saw the first one. It was okay.
