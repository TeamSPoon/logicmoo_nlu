Who's your favorite NFL player?
My favorite player? Hmm. I'm not sure I have a favorite player.
No one at all?
Well, I usually think in terms of teams.
So what teams do you like?
I like the Ravens a lot. They were very popular where I grew up.
Hmm. That makes sense.
What about you?
What about me?
What teams do you like?
I like the Steelers a lot.
Didn't you grow up in California?
Yeah, but my Grandpa was from Pittsburg, and we used to watch games together.
That sounds like a really nice memory.
It is! I really enjoyed those days.
What about players? Do you have a favorite?
I was actually asking because I'm not sure if I do!
No one at all?
If I had to pick, maybe Ben Roethlisberger.
That's a good choice!
