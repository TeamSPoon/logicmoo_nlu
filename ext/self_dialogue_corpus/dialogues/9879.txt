What do you think of NWA?
I think they were pioneers in rap music.
Do you think they are an all time great group?
I would have to say yes.
What makes them so great?
They had some great people in the group.
It's strange Dr. Dre became the most successful.
I figured Easy E would have been the biggest.
He was at one point but then he died.
Yeah but his legacy will be one as a pioneer for AIDS research.
