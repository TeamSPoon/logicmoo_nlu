What are you up to.
Just gonna do a little shopping.
Boring!
True. How bout you?
Gonna check out that second run theatre.
Oh, cool. What's playing?
They're doing some classics. Tonight is Cassablanca.
Never seen it.
What?!
It's on the "bucket list".
As it should.
What's so great about it?
Bogart?
Fair enough.
Skip the shopping and come with me.
Well, I suppose the shopping can wait.
And it should, you uncultured schmuck!
Easy now!
Ha!
Let's go!
