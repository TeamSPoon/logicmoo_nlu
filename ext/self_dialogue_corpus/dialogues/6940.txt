Dad, what is your favorite Disney movie ever made?
I would have to say Aladdin.
Why Aladdin?
Well the way the movie was animated and made it had very good graphics.
I agree with you there, the graphics were awesome.
Plus, I love the genie in the bottle.
Oh that was my favorite character to.
What was your favorite scene with him?
It was when the genie helped Aladdin conquer Jaffar and save the castle.
My favorite part is when he was first introduced, he appeared scary but was a friendly person.
