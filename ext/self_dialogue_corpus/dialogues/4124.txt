Have you ever seen Kill Bill?
Yes it's one of my favorite thrillers ever. Tarantino is a genius.
Yes I agree and that's my favorite movie by him.
Do you like volume 2?
I like it ok but part one has a lot more action.
I like that for whatever reason they kept her name hidden until part 2.
Just to add an air of mystery I'm sure. I love the yellow and black suit she wore.
That was to pay homage to Bruce Lee in Fists of Fury.
Well it was a great homage because she really worked it.
I've probably seen that movie a million times. The fight scenes never get old.
