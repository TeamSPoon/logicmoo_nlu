Who's your favorite rock group?
My favorite rock group is The White Stripes.
Oh I love the White Stripes! Jack White is so talented and crazy.
Right and I love Meg White too. She's so cute and innocent.
She lent her vocals to one song of theirs that I know of.
In the Cold Cold night. Yeah I love that song.
It was lowkey but still very sweet. And she doesn't have a bad voice.
No she doesn't, it's very unique. Have you seen Under Great White Northern Lights?
You mean their concert movie? Yes I've seen it a couple of times.
I love the version of Seven Nation Army that he performed on stage in Canada.
Right that was so awesome! He turned his back to the stage and played that solo riff.
Do you remember when they were on The Simpsons.
Yes that was hilarious. They did The Hardest Button to Button.
First song I ever heard by them was Dead Leaves and the Dirty Ground.
That's a great song there. And the video is awesome.
I love that one and Fell in Love With a Girl.
I like that one too. Did you know they remade Jolene by Dolly Parton?
Yes they did a very unique take on that song.
Yes I love it. And I love Blue Orchid.
That song is crazy. Jack White featured his wife in that video.
