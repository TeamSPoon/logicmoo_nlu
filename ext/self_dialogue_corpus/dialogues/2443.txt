What is the deepest position in NFL football?
Deepest as in has the most talent?
Yes - which position has the most talent?
Well I would say that punter has a lot of talent.
I am talking skill positions.
Well I would say tight end - it seems like a lot of teams have good ones.
I somewhat agree.
It seems like tight end usage comes down to implementation.
The Patriots have always used tight ends well.
That might just be Brady doing his thing.
You make a good point - they have amazing offensive schemes, though.
So yeah, it definitely comes down to utilization and scheme type.
But I would also say that running back seems pretty solid now.
There are fewer feature backs, and more specialty backs - but a lot of them.
You are right - there are a ton of solid running backs.
With that said, the higher end talent seems more scarce.
It seems that the playing field is more even, though.
I wonder if these trends will continue this season.
As long as passing is so highly touted, then I think so.
Yes, I agree. We will see what happens.
