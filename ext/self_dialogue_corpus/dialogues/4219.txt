Are you a fan of thriller movies?
Not really. I do not find being scared entertaining.
I agree. I did think Alien v. Predator was good.
Oh, I did too! I was not scared by that film at all.
I wish they would make more like that. Many thrillers these days are not entertaining.
I know. They only have shock value.
I would rather watch an old film such as Michael Myers.
Those were the best, even though they were horror films.
Maybe I will put one on tonight.
Keep the lights on!
