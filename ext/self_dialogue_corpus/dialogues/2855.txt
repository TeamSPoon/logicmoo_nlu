It's that time, NFL season is closing in. Who in your eyes will be the team to beat?
Well not much of a shocker here but I see that the Patriots will be that team you want to beat.
They did go 17-2 last season and gathered up their fifth Lombardi trophy.
Indeed, and with the additions of a few players they look even better on paper for this season.
Better than a 17-2 winning season?
Well, I am not saying it will be a better record but it is going to be just as good maybe a game better.
I can see another team being right there and that is Okland. Snapping their 13-year playoff drought, might have ignited the fire in this franchise.
Agreed, with a playmaker like Marshawn Lynch and Amari Cooper, not to mention a 100% Derek Carr....this could be their year.
Don't forget Khalil Mack and Bruce Irvin, their edge rush defense is going to be one to watch out for.
Exactly, Raiders are as talented as any team out there.
What about those Green Bay Packers?
With a man like Aaron Rodgers, having an NFL history with career passing efficiency rating over 100! I don't see much trouble for them to grab another NFC North title this season.
That is a weapon within itself but lets not forget he has a new weapon in tight end Martellus Bennett! Mix him in with Randall Cobb and Jordy Nelson.
Oh yeah, NFC North is pretty much booked unless a team can step up to the challenge.
So with those teams in the spotlight who do you think will turn out on top?
Each team will win 13 games, that I can say.
You did not answer the question as to which team do you believe will do it?
I will have to say that the Atlanta Falcons will do it!
Wait wait! We did not bring the Falcons into the mix.
I guess that I must explain another time.
