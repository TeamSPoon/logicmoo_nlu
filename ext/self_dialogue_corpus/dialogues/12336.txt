Did you know Jabba the Hut was supposed to be furry?
Huh?  You're making that up.
No, I'm serious.  He was originally written as a furry character.
I just can't even picture that.
Yeah, I guess the idea got dumped because they didn't think he'd be scary enough.
Jabba is pretty ugly looking with his pasty skin and what not.
If he was furry, you'd just want to pet him, not hurt him.
That would have been an odd dynamic for the series.
I'm glad George Lucas came to his senses.
At least he did about something!
