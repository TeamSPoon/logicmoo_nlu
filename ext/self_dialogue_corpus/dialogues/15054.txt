What is your favorite Will Ferrell movie?
Hmm, thats a tough one.
I would stay StepBrothers.
I could say that but I also think Talladega Nights was awesome.
The acting was so funny.
John C Reilly was awesome
He was a great secondary character.
So maybe that is the best
I just love Step Brothers
Its hard to change.
