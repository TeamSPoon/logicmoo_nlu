Know what I like?
Strawberry Champagne?
How'd you know?
You've been singing Bruno Mars all day.
I love that song.
Yes, I can tell. I just said you've been singing it all day.
Do you like it?
Yes, but with one slight issue.
Of course you found something. What is it this time?
Strawberry Champagne doesn't exist. I think he means strawberry-flavored bubbly wine. Champagne is super specific.
