what do you think of the force awakens?
i did not care for it.
Really? it was a cinematic masterpiece.
i thought rey wasn't that interesting of a character.
she's just as good as luke or anakin, I think.
I disagree.
that is your opinion. kylo is awesome too.
He's not as good as vader or maul though.
the cinematic scenes were amazing too.
I'll give it that to be honest.
