CB's in the league took a bit of a hit last year.
What do you mean exactly?
Just seems like some depth at the position is missing.
I think there's a lot of good CB's playing.
Not saying they're not good players, but not really a top ten player right now.
You mean like a Deion of old?
Well, there will never be another Deion.  I would take a Revis.
So any shutdown corner really.
Yeah.  Patrick Peterson was probably the best last year.
He's always been really good for the Cards.
Good, but not great.  You wouldn't vote him into the hall.
Didn't that one guy play well too?
One guy?  Wow, that's helpful.
The guy that plays for the Chiefs.
Oh, Marcus Peters.  Yeah, he's coming up quick.
He was a great draft pick by Andy Reid.
I should probably include Sherman too.
Overrated in my opinion.
Maybe, but he's a great player.
