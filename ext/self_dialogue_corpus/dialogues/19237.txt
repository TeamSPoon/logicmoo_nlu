If you had to pick your favorite genre of music which would you choose?
I would have to say Hip Hop music.
Why do you pick that?
Because it's upbeat, keeps me going.
Oh okay I see.
I really like R&B music.
I like some of that too, depends on the artist.
I enjoy a lot of artists from the 90s and some from the early 2000s.
Like who?
Well, I like 112, Dru Hill, Ginuwine.
Those are all great artists. Actually not sure if I recognize Dru Hill or not though.
The artist Sisqo who had the hit song "The Thong Song" was in that group.
Oh okay I do remember him then.
They had really great music together.
I'll have to look them up.
Of course I can't forget Boyz 2 Men. They were amazing.
I definitely liked them. A definite classic.
That was the kind of music you played if you wanted to impress someone.
Yes I agree, I loved their song "End of The Road."
I remember that one well, I loved it.
