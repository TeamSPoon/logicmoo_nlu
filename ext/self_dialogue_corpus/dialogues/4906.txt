Good morning.
Morning.
Do you like baseball?
Yep, big fan.
Cool, same here.
Nice.
What's your favorite thing about the game?
That's a good question.
Take your time.
I think maybe because it was such a big part of my childhood.
Oh okay, like good memories?
Yeah, and also I played a little bit.
Oh, were you good?
No, not really, but it was the only sport I really played.
I played a bit myself.
Were you good?
Nope, terrible.
Well that makes two of us.
Good chatting.
You too.
