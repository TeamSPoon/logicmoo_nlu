Did you like Batman v Superman?
No, it was not very good.
What didn't you like about it?
Some of the casting choices were a little strange.
Are you talking about Lex Luthor?
Yeah, Jesse Eisenburg was a strange choice.
Did you think he over acted?
His performance was just strange.
What about the 'Martha' part?
One of the dumbest plot lines I've ever seen in a movie.
