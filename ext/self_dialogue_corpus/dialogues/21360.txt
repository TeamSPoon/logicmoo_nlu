Hey Betty how are you doing?
I'm awesome Brad! Was thinking about seeing a film today!
Oh, that sounds awesome. Movies are a bit expensive, it'd have to be amazing for me to want to see anything nowadays.
I was thinking of that new Fast and the Furious movie.
I have been living under a rock, that came out?
Yeah! And it has the Rock in it!
Good one haha! I do like the Rock, and the new one has insane special effects.
I think it is showing in IMAX too!
Does that mean 3-D?
Not really, IMAX is just a huge screen with incredible surround sound.
So it is like stadium seating?
Exactly! You want to go?
Maybe. Who else is in it?
Most of the original cast, and I think Vin Diesel goes rogue in this one.
It is the 8th film so things needed to change up I think.
Yeah, this one seems different and cool.
Ok awesome! Shall we go to Citywalk Theatre in Universal?
That is the one I wanted to visit!
Let's go see the noon show!
Sounds awesome!
