Have you heard of the music artist Future?
Yeah, he is awesome.
Did you hear the new song by him?
Which one are you talking about?
The one called Mask Off.
Is that the song with the flute in the background?
Yeah, it is.
I love that song, it's really catchy.
Me too, I can't get enough of it.
Have you heard the song called Draco?
Yeah, that one is really good too.
I know right, I'm addicted to it.
It's crazy how much good music Future creates.
Yeah, he really has a lot of musical talent.
I don't even really like rappers, but I enjoy most of his music.
I feel the same way. Other rappers don't even compare to him.
Did you hear about the drama between him and Ciara.
Yeah, she tried to sue him over some bull crap.
He basically said that she's trying to get custody from him for their child.
Shes disgusting and a horrible mother.
