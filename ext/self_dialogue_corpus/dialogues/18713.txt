So what do you think of Metallica?
Uh, I haven't really listened to anything by them for a while.
Oh really? That's a shame, they did a new album recently.
Whats the album called? I guess I'll give it a try.
Hardwired to self destruct.
I'll look it up now and give some of the songs a try.
So what do you think?
I haven't really listened to it all yet but I'm not really a fan of the opening song at least.
Yeah Confusion is a bit out of place to be honest, Try Dream no more.
Ah well if its just Confusion thats like this I suppose I'll try some of the other songs.
Oh fair warning, Dream no more has a bit of a Cthulhu theme going.
Yeah so I've found. I really like it though, really consistent song.
Yeah I suppose thats true. You listening to anything else new recently?
Uh yeah actually, I recently found Motörhead and I'm mostly stuck on the Inferno album.
Ah so you basically found God then, nice.
Is that really how some of the fans view Lemmy?
Yeah actually. No jokes there. So you got a favourite song in Inferno I should take a look at, or is the entire album worth a look?
I guess the entire album is worth a look, though maybe try Terminal show first. If you look it up its the first song in the album so no worries about finding it in a playlist.
Inferno is a really great album actually, don't listen to it enough.
Can you really ever listen to Motörhead enough?
