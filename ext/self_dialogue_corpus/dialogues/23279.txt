Tonight is movie night at my house.  Any suggestions?
Well, do you have HBO by any chance?
Yes I do.
Well in that case, I'd recommend a movie called The Wizard of Lies.
Remind me what that one is about?
It's a movie about Bernie Madoff.  Starring Robert De Niro.
Oh yes!  I've seen a lot of ads and random articles about it.
Yes, it was a pretty good movie.
What did you like about it?
Well as you'd expect, it was very well acted.  De Niro steals the show I thought.
I figured he'd be great in it.  De Niro is a ridiculously versatile actor.
Yes, he can do comedy and drama equally well now.  He's awesome.
So is the movie a biopic about Madoff?
Well not really.  There are aspects of his entire life, but it mostly focuses on his later years when the fraud was revealed.
Oh ok, interesting.  I really like these movies HBO comes out with.
Yes, I agree.  There political movies in the past have been really good too.
So besides De Niro, who else was good in this movie?
Michelle Pfeiffer, for sure.  She was amazing as Madoff's wife.
Oh she's a terrific actress as well.
Yes, I thought she really did a good job portraying Ruth Madoff as a sympathetic type figure.
