Is Nickelback really that bad?
No.  It's just kind of fun to trash them.
So many people have made fun of them over the years.
They're kind of a punchline, but there's tons of bands that are worse.

What one girl?
You remember Avril Lavigne?
You're kidding me.  The 'Sk8er Boy' chick?
That's the one.
Small world I guess.  Isn't he way too old for her?
