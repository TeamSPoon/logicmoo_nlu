I think the mascots are pretty fun to watch at the football games.
Some of them really have personalities.
Do you have any favorites?
Jaxson de Ville is pretty entertaining.
Oh he's really creative.
I know. He has lots of fun ways to enter the stadium.
I think Sourdough Sam is interesting because he changes his costumes.
Isn't he the mascot for the 49ers?
He is.
I think Pat Patriot is a good match for the Patriots.
Well I think Rampage has a good looking mask for the Rams.
Are there any mascots you don't like the costumes for?
I don't care for the masks of the mascots of the Denver Broncos.
How come?
They're just so small and not that animated.
Does every team have a mascot?
No, some of them don't.
Any idea as to why?
I really don't have a clue.
At least most of the teams do.
