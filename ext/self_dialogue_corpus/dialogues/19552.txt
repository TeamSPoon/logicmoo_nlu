Have you heard the new Ed Sheeran album?
No, I haven't, but my sister bought it.
Oh, it's great.
Yeah, that's what she said too.
Did she say anything else about it?
Not really.  I didn't really pay attention though, because she's a big Ed Sheeran fan anyway.
Oh, don't you like his music?
I've liked all his music I've heard on the radio.  I've just never sat down and listened to a whole album.
What's your favorite song by him?
Definately not tha one that everyone uses for their wedding song.
Oh, "Thinking Out Loud?"  Why not?
It's just overplayed.  I got tired of hearing it at every wedding I went to.
Oh, I see.  The song wasn't bad though.
No, not the first two hundred times I heard it.
So what is your favorite then?
I think I like "Don't" the best.  Either that or maybe "Photograph."
Yeah, I liked those too.
Wasn't "Don't" based on a true experience?
It supposedly was.  Some other artist.
Oh, so he writes songs about girls kind of like Taylor Swift writes about her exes.
