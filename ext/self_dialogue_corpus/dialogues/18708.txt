My favorite music genre is country.
Mine too.
My fiance doesn't like country at all.
My husband doesn't like country either, he likes rap.
My fianc√© likes rock.
Do you like any of the rock that he listens too?
Some of it, I like Guns & Roses.
Yes they are pretty good, I like Welcome To The Jungle.
I do too. Do you like any of the rap your husband listens too?
I like a little bit of Eminem.
I have heard some of his music it isn't too bad.
Yes, but country is my favorite.
Agreed, I love the easy listening of it.
I do too, and there are some really good newer artists out there.
I agree, I really like diversity in country music now.
Me too, I love Sam Hunt's new song Body Like A Backroad.
Me too, and it sounds a little like rap.
It does that is exactly what I keep telling my husband.
One day we will get these men to like good music.
Yes, we can only hope.
