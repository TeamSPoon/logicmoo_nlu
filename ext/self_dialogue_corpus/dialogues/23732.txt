What do you think about movies that you can only watch once?
What do you mean?
It's a movie that you can only watch once, silly.
You can watch any movie more than once. It's really simple. Just watch it again.
No, no. Sorry. A movie you can only enjoy once.
In what way?
So, let's say there's a movie you really like, but if you watch it again, it's nowhere near as enjoyable?
Oh, an opposite-easter-egg movie, where you can't enjoy it more?
Yup.
I'd have to say The Sixth Sense.
Why did you only enjoy it once?
Well, it was fine the first time. But it's a movie with a twist. Any subsequent viewings will be diluted as you know what's happening.
Ahh, I get it, like the Usual Suspects?
Sort of. You can watch that movie more than once, but not too many times.
What makes them different?
Well, in The Usual Suspects, there is a lot of smart "planting" of hints as to what's coming, and you can look for it each time.
You can't do that in The Sixth Sense?
No, there all you can do is say "Okay, he's dead, yup, makes sense."
How's that different?
Well, in the Usual Suspects, there's actual evidence in writing all over the place you can see and put together. Each time you find something new.
