Have you ever see Crocodile Dundee?
Waaay back in the day!
What ever happend to that actor?
Paul Hogan?
Yeah.
I'm not sure. He was super popular in the 80's.
True. Did you see the sequel?
Unfortunately!
The first one was good though.
Hilarious!
They should make more movies like that.
How do you mean?
Funny and wholsome.
That's not a knife...
This is a kife!
Hahaha!
I did like the start of the second one.
Where he's blowing up the fish?
Too funny!
Let's watch the first one again.
