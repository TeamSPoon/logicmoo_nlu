Do you like listening to Rock music?
Oh yeah I listen to Guns N Roses all of the time.
Me too, I just love their Appetite for Destruction
I love the song It's So Easy on that album.
Oh me too, I probably play that like ten times a day.
I do not blame you, it is catchy.
What else do you like?
Aerosmith.
I love Dream On from them.
Oh that is the best song they have.
