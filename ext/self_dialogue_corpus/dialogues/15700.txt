Do you listen to My Chemical Romance?
Yes I think they make good music.
What is their best album in your mind?
I brough you my bullets was my favorite.
Mine too, I saw them perform it live once.
Was it before or after their fame?
It was about a month before they blew up, it was the only album out that they had.
They took a strange path to stardom.
How so?
Well they didnt have a whole lot of time in the indie scene.
Thats because they were great musicians.
Yeah I mean I agree they knew how to write a good song.
And thats not the only thing, they had a great background too.
In what sense?
They were from an area that produced alot of music and stars so it sounded good.
Oh OK their influences?
Yes and you can hear them on the song Helena.
That might be my favorite song by them
I agree it was a hit
It brought them a modicum of radio success too.
