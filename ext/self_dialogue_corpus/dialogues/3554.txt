Hey, Jaws came out 42 years ago this summer
Wow! That's a long time ago.
Yeah and the movie still holds up
Yeah, definitely makes me think twice about going into the water at the beach
Some great acting in that first one
Yes, Roy Schneider and Richard Dreyfus
Richard Dreyfus?
Yes, he was the shark scientist with all the answers...supposedly
Oh yeah, I forgot about him
Yeah, I thought he did a good job. Definitely one of his best.
