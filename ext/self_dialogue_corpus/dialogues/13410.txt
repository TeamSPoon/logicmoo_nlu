What's your favorite planet in the Star Wars universe?
I would have to say Coruscant.
Why that one?
It just feels right, I love how it's this big bustling planet.
What do you mean?
Well from what we've seen in the movies it's this huge sci-fi city and I believe thats pretty much all we've seen of it.  I just love the fact that it's all busy and advanced.
That's a good point, you'd think with how advanced all these species are that most planets would be like that.
I agree I always thought it was odd when a planet felt like they were less advanced than we are.
I never thought about it but you make a good point.
That's why I liked it the most though some of the other planets were good too.
