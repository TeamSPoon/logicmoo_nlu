Did you watch the Lakers and the Cavaliers Wednesday?
Yeah, my cable didn't get the Bulls game so I watched that one.
Did you see Kevin Durant's reverse dunk last night?
Yeah, they should have never let him inside with that much room.
So who do you think will win, the Bulls or the Thunder?
My money's on the Bulls, they've been hot lately.
Did you hear LeBron James may be injured and miss the next couple of games?
Yeah, put I wouldn't count on it.  It's probably just a scam to throw off the Vegas odds makers.
I think this may be the year for the Celtics to remake their dynasty.
Oh, go back to Boston already, it will be a long time before that happens again.
Did you see all the celebrities at the Lakers game?
I saw Jack Nicholson but he's always there.
I heard from somebody that Kevin Curry's not happy and may go free agent.
Not happy?  How many millons does the guy want?
I waiting for the Thunder's next home game.  I'm going to try and get tickets.
Good luck with that, if you do, they'll be nose-bleaders...
I got in a bracket and picker the Pistons to go all the way.
Were you drunk?  They'll never get past Cleveland.
Did you see Westbrook shooting free throws last night?
Yeah, he must have trained with Shaq'  -- many bricks.
