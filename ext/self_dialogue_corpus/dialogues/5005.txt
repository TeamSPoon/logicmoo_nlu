Have you been watching Baseball this year
Yeah a few games, Yankees are looking good.
Im an Orioles fan myself, they have been playing well
I saw that they lost yesterday though.
Yeah, but as of now they are still in first by half a game.
Yeah, I have a feeling that the wildcard team will be the team that takes second in the AL east.
Judge is looking good for you guys.
Yeah he is batting .315 after yesterdays game
Yankees have a lot of good young players.
Yeah. they were smart to trade their veterans when they did.
Yeah. this is a bonus for you, thye were supposed to be rebuilding.
Orioles look good too, looks like Dylan Bundy is coming around.
Yeah, 5-1 so far with around a 2.00 ERA
Machado looks like he is coming around.
Yeah, he was batting under .200 a couple weeks ago but is now at .227, he has been great defensively all year though.
I remember hi making plays, last time they played the Yankees
This should be a good season, as long as Boston is not in it.
Agreed they are public enemy number 1 to me.
Next time our teams play each other, we go catch a game.
That would be great, good to see you again.
