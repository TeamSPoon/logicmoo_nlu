My wife just got me the four Brahms symphonies for Father's Day.
Nice.  Which symphony?
The BSO, with Andris Nelsons.
I haven't gone since the James Levine days.
Well, he is quite dynamic.  And young - only 38.
That's great news for the BSO.  How were they?
Pretty powerful.  I think his interpretation of the fourth was best.
My favorite is the third.
I liked the first.  Beethoven's tenth!
That's for sure!
I heard Nelsons in 2011, at Carnegie Hall.
With the BSO?
Yes, Levine couldn't conduct that night.
Interesting.
I heard him in Tanglewood, too, in the summer of 2012.
I wish I were there.
I saw him at Symphony Hall in January of 2013.
When did he get the BSO post?
May of 2013, but he did not start until 2014.
I suppose the rest is history.
