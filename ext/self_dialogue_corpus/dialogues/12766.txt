I'm wondering, did Mace Windu really defeat Palpatine in Revenge of the Sith?
What do you mean?
Windu knocks Palpatine down before Anakin arrives. Was that a ruse, or did Windu really win?
I'd assume Palpatine faked defeat to help turn Anakin.
Yeah, but Palpatine wasn't a skilled lightsaber user. He was more powerful with the Force.
I thought the Force made you a better lightsaber duelist?
But, Windu was an incredible duelist, and had Palpatine cornered in a small room. He even blocked his Force lightning.
I'm not sure. Maybe Windu really won.
I think it's open to interpretation, but I think Palpatine really was screwed if Anakin hadn't arrived.
Maybe. It could go either way.
