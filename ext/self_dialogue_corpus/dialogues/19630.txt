What do you think of Amy Vachal?
Her name sounds familiar...
She was one of the finalists on the Voice for Team Adam!
Oh right, the jazz singer?
Yes, she is amazing!
I agree.  What about Justin Bieber?
I really like his new song, Despacito.
Me too, it's pretty neat.
He didn't have a noticeable accent at all in his Spanish.
Definitely, it's also a beat that I can dance to at parties.
Likewise.  Maroon 5 is another great band.
Oh yes, I really enjoy their pop music.
They have been around for quite some time now.
Right! Started when I was younger.
Do you like The Weeknd?
I think he's a great singer.
He has a mixture of Bruno Mars and Michael Jackson to me.
I agree, he is a combination of both.
Oh how I miss Michael Jackson!
He was a legend.
