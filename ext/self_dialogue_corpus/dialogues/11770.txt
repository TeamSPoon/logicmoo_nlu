Did the Beatles music have as big an impact as we think?
This is a good question because I have heard both sides.
I mean I think some of the songs like Help have really made an impact on people.
Right but what did it do.
I think their music told people it was OK to be different.
Yeah but wasnt there already different music?
This is what I struggle with.
I think their music has a lasting impact in that it showed how to vary four chords.
But what about what they did for the globe.
They just made it known you can live a lavish lifestyle and still write good songs.
