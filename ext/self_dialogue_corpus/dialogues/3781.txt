Do you remember the movie "The Sixth Sense"?
Yeah, that made a lot of buzz when it came out.
I was really afraid of it when I was younger.
Me too. That tent scene was creepy.
I think the concept was fresh territory back then, too.
Any scary movie that involves a child creeps me out.
Especially one that communicates with the dead.
It was cool to see Bruce Willis in a film like that.
He played a convincing father role. I thought he was great.
Me too. You don't usually see actors of that caliber in thriller movies.
