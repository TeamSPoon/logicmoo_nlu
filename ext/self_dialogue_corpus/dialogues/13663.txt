Did you see Rouge One?
Yes, I loved it.  I was worried when they said Darth Vader was going to be in it but it was great.
I am sorry that they all died because I want another movie
Same, give me more
How did you feel about Leia at the end
I was crying, I saw it after Carrie died
It was a good surprise
This is exactly what I needed to see
It made me excited to the Last Jedi, even though they are not related
They are just making better movies now
