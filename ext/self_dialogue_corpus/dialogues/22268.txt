Do you really think Major League 3 is going to happen?
Wasnt there already a Major League 3?
Technically no it was called back to the minors.
Oh OK no I do not think they will actually film it.
I think most of those guys have careers.
Sheen was the only one that really had one.
Dennis Haysbert isnt doing too bad.
Nope you are right about that.
So do you think theyll do it?
I think they will try to.
I cant imagine the plot.
Im sure it will be so convoluted
Like they try one last time to make the league.
Or the league goes on strike and theyre replacement players
That sounds like an actual plot.
Yeah but its far fetched.
Its Hollywood it could be.
True but who is giving any credence to it?
Someone who eats this stuff up.
The viewing audience most likely
