What is your most favorite movie you went to see in a movie theater?
That is a hard choice.
Do you have a few in mind?
Well two actually. ET and Raiders of the Lost Arc.
I love those movies but why are they your favorites?
ET was the first movie my mother took me to after my parents got divorced.
I would think that would be a sad reason.
It was but it was also a bonding element for my mother and I so it was a good thing.
I can see that and it makes pretty good sense.
It is nice when you can attach a good memory to a bad situation.
And why do you like Raiders of the Lost Arc.
My mom and I went to see it after I got home from the first summer trip to my dad's after the divorce.
So it has sentimental reasoning too?
No not that one, it was just hilarious.
What do you mean hilarious? There were a couple of funny parts but I wouldn't describe it as hilarious.
So my mom and I were having issues because I was pissed she wouldn't let me come home early when I was miserable.
How old were you then?
I think I was 13 or maybe 14.
Ok so why was it so funny?
Remember when Harrison Ford fell down into the chamber with the snakes and the cobra stood up in front of his face? My mother who is petrified of snakes, cleared the chair and had her butt and feet both on the back part of the chair where she stayed while watching the rest of the movie.
