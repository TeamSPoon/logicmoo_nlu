Do you like the Alien movie franchise?
I love the Alien movies. Ridley Scott is a genius.
I agree with that, and Sigourney Weaver is great as Ripley.
Those to me are some of the scariest movies of all time.
No arguments there. I had no idea Prometheus was a prequel for the Alien movies.
It was? I've never even seen Prometheus.
Oh you've gotta see it, it's a great movie. Let's you know what happened before the original Alien.
Wow I've got to make it a point to see that one. Have you seen Alien Covenant?
The brand new one? Not yet but I heard it wasn't that great.
I don't like taking others' opinions for movies but I think I'll give it a try.
