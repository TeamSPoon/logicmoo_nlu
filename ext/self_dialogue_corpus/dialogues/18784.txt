Do you like Bheetoven?
Yeah, the most powerful classical music you could listen to.
He changed music forever.  Imagine listening to his 9th for the first time?
I know, even today it's one of the most impressive pieces I've ever heard.
The way it builds from the start and the giant wall of sound during Ode to Joy.
Maybe the best segment of music ever.
Yeah, not enough people appreciate it because it's so overplayed and heard.
His 5th was really good too.  All the speed and anger.
I also like Fur Alise, that was relaxing and thought provoking
Yeah, it was.  More people should pay closer attention to classical these days.
Or at least some of the better stuff.
I'd like to see someone do some more rock classical.
Kind of like Trans Siberian Orchestra?
Yeah, just like them.  Only a little less Christmas based.
That would be awesome.  Bheetovens 5th on an electric guitar.
Oh yeah, that would be beyond epic.
Would be really hard though.
Yeah, and probably not popular.
But I'd like it.
Me too.
