Did you see Gladiator?
The one that won best picture in 2000?
Yup, with Russel Crowe.
Yes, and my marching band performed the music from it.
What did you think?
Honestly, it did NOT deserve best picture.
Why not?
Well, the action is great, but the rest is awful.
Did you think he was the right actor?
Yes, he portrayed him well, but he's supposed to be Spanish but doesn't have an accent!
