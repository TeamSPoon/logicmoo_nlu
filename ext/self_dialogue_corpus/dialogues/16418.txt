Dude, this new track is sick.
What are you listening to?
The new Gorillaz single!
Its out already?
Yup, came out yesterday.
OH MY GOD LET ME LISTEN PLEASE.
Here, take one of my earbuds.
This is so good.
I know right?
They've really done it again.
They always knock it out of the park.
I want to dance to this serious its so dancey!
How long have you been a fan?
Ever since I first heard Feel Good Inc.
Hah, nice, me too.
Yeah? That seemed to be what turned a lot of people onto them.
It was just so catchy.
Truly it was.
Alright, thats enough for now, I have to get to work.
Thanks for letting me listen!
