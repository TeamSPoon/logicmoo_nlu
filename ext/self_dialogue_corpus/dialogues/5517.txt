I just saw Disney's The Good Dinosaur!
How did you like it?
I enjoyed it a lot. A bit of a tearjerker though.
Some of the Disney movies are.
Yeah this young dinosaur's dad died early on, like Bambi's mother did.
That was definitely sad.
Then it gets terribly lost, and goes on a long journey.
How does it go?
It meets a lost human boy, they both have adventures, and it finds a family for the boy.
Sounds like a typical sweet Disney tale.
