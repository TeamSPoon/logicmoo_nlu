I saw the best documentary on Netflix called Betting on Zero.
Isn't that about the company Herbalife?
Yes. It was fascinating.
I've never understood why these multi-level marketing companies are allowed to stay in business when they're scams.
The movie talks about that. The FCC and other agencies investigated them, and practically called them a pyramid scheme but didn't directly.
Well why not?
They talk about how the FCC is reluctant to label anyone as a pyramid scheme, even though they describe them with the literal definition they use for pyramid schemes.
Why not just shut them down?
The documentary talks about how insanely profitable the company was for a select few, and they used that money to buy endorsements from incredibly respected people to speak out for them.
And I'm sure they could afford the best lawyers, too.
Exactly. Since very rich people are making lots more money, they won't shut them down.
Did they have any consequences from the FCC investigation?
They were fined and got their hand slapped, and had to settle with millions of people who they ripped off over the years.
Well that's good!
Not really, the settlement amount was so low that people were lucky if they got back 10 bucks.
That's awful.
And they really targeted Mexican-Americans to rip off, betting they didn't understand enough to figure out it was a scam, with the language barrier and such.
That's just despicable to target immigrants to rip off.
I know! The movie interviewed some of the people who got scammed, and they lost thousands.
What a terrible thing when they're just trying to chase the American Dream.
