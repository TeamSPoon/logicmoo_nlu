Ever hear of DJ Muro?
No. Who is he?
He's a Japanese DJ who samples old jazz tunes.
Sounds cool!
It is. Diggin' Black Jazz was his best album.
I'll check it out.
He also does some stuff sampled from 1970s disco and easy listening.
I don't think i would like that.
I don't. It isn't nearly as good.
Is he new?
No, he's fairly old, like in his 40s.
How long has he been a DJ?
A long time. I've known about him for at least 10 years.
What are his other albums?
He has a few. Most of them have 'diggin' in the title.
I'll have to look for them.
I once found one in a used record store.
What was it called?
I don't know, the liner notes were in Japanese. Cool album, though.
That's hysterical.
