I just read an article about a new song by Prince's father being released this year.
Oh? I didn't know Prince's dad was still alive.
He's not. He passed away in 2001.
Ah, I see. What was his name? I don't recall hearing much about Prince's dad.
His name was John L. Nelson. But his stage name was Prince Rogers. He was a jazz musician back in the day.
Music talent runs in the family.
Sounds like it.
What's the name of the new song that's being released?
Heart of Mine. It's said to be the first single from the album, “Don’t Play With Love, The John L. Nelson Project,”
Who's releasing it?
Prince's half-sister, Sharon Nelson.
Oh wow. I never knew Prince had a half sister either.
Neither did I until now.
So, I'm guessing the album is jazz?
Yeah, that's what the article said.
When's it releasing?
October 27th of this year.
Cool. I've got to remember to pick it up.
I'm going to buy some of his dad's other albums. I don't think he was very famous though.
Well, if it wasn't for Prince's father getting into music, we wouldn't have Purple Rain.
