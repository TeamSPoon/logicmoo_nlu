Have you ever seen The Little Mermaid?
Of course, that's one of my favorites!
Who's your favorite character?
I would have to say Sebastian.
Really? Why?
I could listen to him talk all day.
Don't forget listening to him sing "Kiss the Girl".
I used to drive my mom crazy singing it.  Whose your favorite character?
Definitely Ariel. There's just something about a mermaid princess.
That's very true.
