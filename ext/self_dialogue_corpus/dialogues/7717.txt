What do you think about Neville Longbottom?
I always felt really badly for him.
I didn't feel bad for him, I thought he was kind of stupid.
I don't think that's fair, he was never made to seem stupid.
Neville couldn't even use a broom the first time he tried!
Well, that's true. But he had a troubled childhood.
How did he have a troubled childhood?
Well, Neville's parents were kept in St. Mungo's and didn't even know who he was.
Really? I didn't know that.
Yeah, he was raised by his grandma, who always treated him like he was a Squib.
