Do you ever watch Disney movies?
Yes, I have seen quite a few of them.
What is your favorite? I really like Beauty and the Beast.
I do too!  I hope to see the live action version that came out in 2017.
So do I.  I love the animated version, but I'm also a fan of Emma Watson and would love to see her play Belle.
I am curious to see how the new one compares to the original.
I think they have kept some of the same songs in but have also added new ones.
I have heard that too.  I am also looking forward to seeing Dan Stevens play the Beast.
Yes, so am I .  Did you know that Robbie Benson voiced the Beast in the animated version?
No I didn't.  That is a surprise; he doesn't strike me as someone who would voice the Beast.
