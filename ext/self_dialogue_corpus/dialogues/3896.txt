What type of movie do you want to see tonight?
I think something scary but not too gory or stupid.
You mean like a thriller?
What's the difference between a thriller and a horror?
They aren't really that much different, except a horror movie is more about graphic depictions of violence and blood.
I would rather be spooked or scared than grossed out or horrified. I don't get why people enjoy watching people get mangled and mutilated.
Me either.
Are there any good thriller movies that came out lately?
The only good one that I thought was frightening was "The Babadook."
Really? That sounds like a kid's movie.
