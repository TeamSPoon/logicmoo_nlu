What is your favorite Tom Hanks Movie
Tom Hanks? I haven't seen much of his work. I really liked Forrest Gump though!
Yeah Forrest Gump is good but you should see more of his old work.
Why is that?
Because his style was completely different
What do you mean different
His older movies, for example Big or Money Pit, he was more focused on comedic acting
Big? That  movie sounds familiar, what is it about?
Tom Hank's character is a 13 year old boy who magically turns into an adult
Oh I've seen that one! That one was released in the 80's wasn't it?
Yeah, it was released around 1988
Cool, but honestly I'm not into movies from the 80's.
What year do you prefer.
I'd like it if you recommended me something from the last 5 years or so.
Oh, no problem. Have you heard of Saving Mr. Banks?
No what's it about?
Tom Hanks plays Walt Disney in a movie about the creation of Mary Poppins
wow, thats something I'd like to see!
He isn't really the main character, but his acting is good nonetheless
I'll have to check it out
