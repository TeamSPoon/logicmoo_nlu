Who's your favorite band these days?
I love the Jayhawks.
Oh, they're still around? I haven's listened to them since Hollywood Town Hall.
Yes, they just came out with a new album last year and toured this year.
What's the new album called? Is it any good?
It's called Paging Mr. Proust. It's one of their best, I think.
Cool. Is it more country or pop?
I would say more pop. Especially compared to Hollywood Town Hall and Tomorrow the Green Grass.
I guess I like their country stuff better. What else you listening to?
Oh, mostly old stuff in my car, like Arcade Fire.
Oh they're a good band, I really like the Suburbs.
That's my favorite of theirs. What are you listening to?
I'm still addicted to Prince.
Ah, man, it's been over a year now!
I know, I can't stop listening to Purple Rain.
I'm not a huge fan of Prince, to be honest.
What?! He was a genius!
I get that, but I was never really into him. I like When Doves Cry and Little Red Corvette.
Do you like Sinead O'Connor's cover of Nothing Compares 2 U?
Yeah, I didnt even know that was a Prince song until after he died.
