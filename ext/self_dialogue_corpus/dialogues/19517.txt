hey did you see Xscape on the BET awards last night
No i didnt watch it because i was working but i saw little snippets on instagram of Tiny singing.
Oh im sure they gonna show it on there again they sounded so good to me but people was talking about Kandi
What they say about her?
That she cant sing nomore and she sounded like a goat things like that.
Really? From the little part I heard they sounded great and kandi voice always been like that she sings really deep
right! that what i said I cant wait for them to go on tour cause im going for sure.
I wonder what the price of the tickets are gonna be.
Well i know it wont be in no beyonce price range.
Do you think they gonna come out with new music?
I dont know in one interview Tiny did she said they wasnt they was just gonna focus on there old music cause thats what they think the fans want
I mean i love the old stuff but its been almost 20 years since there first album I think they still go it they should drop something new make more classics
They would need jermaine depree to produce them tho for that same ol school rnb sound and I dont think they talk to him anymore
really? I didnt hear that I wonder why
Probably cause of money Its always over money hahaha
Plus I think kandi slept with him or something like that.
No that was a rumor that one of the members of the group started cause they was mad at her
Oh well im glad they got over it whats your favorite song by them
ummmmmmm it would have to be understanding I love that song
I think mine would be do you want too I used to have that jam on repeat
