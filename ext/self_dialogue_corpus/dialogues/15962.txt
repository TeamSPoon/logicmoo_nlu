Whats your favorite type of music?
Man, I really miss late 90's early 200's ghetto rap.
Really? Why?
I grew up with it, and today's version of rap is terrible. Have you heard this new stuff?
Yea, I kind of like it.
Eww why? It sounds like they are mumbling and I can't understand anything.
I agree, but I also think it's a new style and we should have open minds.
I did have an open mind, Lil Wayne shut it.
How can you blame this on him?
He was the one who started this mumble rap genre.
How so?
Remember his first hit song?
I remember Go DJ.
Fine. Does that sound like anything he does now?
Well no, but styles change and adapt.
Why did it change though?
Because the whole game was changing at the time, so he adjusted to it.
Nope. Try again.
Just tell me why then.
He started using Promathazine and his speech slurred because of it. That's why we have mumble rap now, it's not talent.
