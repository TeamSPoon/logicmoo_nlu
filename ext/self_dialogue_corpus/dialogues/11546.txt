Beatles recorded for the Apple Record Label didn't they?
True. I remember their 45 records had a lime green label on them.
What Beatles song was first made famous by a Motown Rnb group?
That easy, "Please Mr. Postman" was first recorded and made a hit the Motown girl group cal the Marvellets. My turn.
When the Beatles first formed there was a fifth Beatle.
There was never more than four Beatles.
Are you sure? Would you bet money on your answer?
I honestly don't remember another Beatle. Was the fifth Beatle a male or famale?
I don't know. I was just buying myself some time until I could come up with another Beatle question.
So what did you come up with "Come Together or St Jude?.."
