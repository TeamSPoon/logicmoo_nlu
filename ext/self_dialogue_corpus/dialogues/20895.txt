It's time for what movie for movie night.
What genre is going to be this time?
I don't know you pick I did the last one.
How about comedy? Give me some of your favorite comedies.
Sure I can do that. Undercover Brother, Bong Water,Earnest Scared Stupid
The first two I can rap my brain around but where did the Earnest Scared Stupid come from?
I love Earnest movies! I have seen all of them!
Jim Varney was a rubber faced man. Those expressions he could make were insane.
Like Jim Carrey!  There is a goofy guy.
You know Jim Varney would have been good at playing The Mask.
Your right he would have been perfect.
Okay so what about your other choices why them?
Jack Black, Andy Dick and Luke Wilson in Bong Water just cracked me up.
The hiking scene and sing along are unforgettable.
Undercover Brother had the most awesome lines and outfits.
When Neil Patrick Harris ,playing the token white guy, yells out "I am not a sissy" and then squashes the guys head in with both his hands.was one of the best scenes.
There were so many quality lines in that movie.
Chris Kattan dancing!!! Oh wow I couldn't stop laughing and didn't want the scene to end for at least a couple of more minutes.
There were a lot of famous actors in that movie.
Yes there was.
