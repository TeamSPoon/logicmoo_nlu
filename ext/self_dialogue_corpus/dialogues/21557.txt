Have you seen the movie Life yet?
No but I want to.  I heard it's pretty good.
Me too, but they haven't released it for rent yet and I don't want to buy it.
Me neither.  I did watch a movie called Passenger that is similar to it.
Did you like it?
Yes it was good, but it was very different.
How so?
Well, if you watch it thinking it's a sci fi movie you will be disappointed.  It's more of a Psychological drama.
I might like that since I am not much into sci fi movies anyway.
Yes I feel like I was robbed because I was hoping for sci fi and I got drama.
If you like sci fi, there is an older movie called The Fifth Element that is good.
Who is in that one?
Bruce Willis and Milla Jovovich.
Bruce Willis hasn't done a lot of sci fi movies.
No he definitely hasn't, but this one was pretty awesome.
I may check that out on Hulu.
There haven't been a lot of new sci fi movies being released at the theatres recently.
Yeah, I've noticed that.
It seems like there a lot more political movies coming out too.
Yes that is unfortunate.
