Hey Fred, have you heard that new song by "Papa Roach"?
Which one?
The song is named "Help" it reminds me a lot of older "Papa Roach" songs
No kidding?  the last album wasn't that good
No this song is back to old school music like "Broken Home"
I guess i'll download it and check it out on Itunes
I don't think you will be dissapointed
I trust your judgement
Hey do you want to throw some hoops tomorrow?
Yeah absolutely
