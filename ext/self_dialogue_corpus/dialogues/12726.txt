But you know what I think is one of THE most illogical things in the Star Wars universe?
What?
Those speeder bikes from Return of the Jedi.
Hmm.. I can see that.
I mean, think about it, you got this REAL dense forest, not a clear path in site, so what do you give your troops?  Bikes that go from zero to hundred miles and hour in a split second.
Yeah, that's not a recipe for disaster.
I know, right?  To me, you need something like that in a place with lots of open spaces like Tatooine or something.
Well, they may not work there, it might be something where the sand is always getting in the engines.
I don't think so, if they can have those pod racers from the Phantom Menace (which takes place, what seventy years ago?) they could use speeder bikes.
That's a good point.  Be faster than riding one of those giant dewback lizard things.
