So have you ever seen Atlantis?
The Stargate series?
No, no, I mean the Disney animated movie.
Is that the one with like. Kida and Milo?
Yep, that's the one! I just watched it the other day and I really loved it.
It's a fun movie for sure. All of the characters are really original and quirky.
Mole is my favourite. The scene where he freaks out over the dirt is the best!
Haha, yes, "England must never merge with France!"
I like the engineer girl too; she was cool without being too in your face about it.
And of course Milo is just super adorkable. I had a bit of a crush on him when I first watched it.
