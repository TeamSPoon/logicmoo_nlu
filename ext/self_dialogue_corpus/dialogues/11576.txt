Did you like the last two Beatles singles from the anthology series?
Yes I did. I thought they were awesome.
Great to know they wouldn't put out anything new without John somehow contributing.
That was the Beatles. It wouldn't have been a true Beatles song if it was just from the remaining three at the time.
I think they are classic. Free as a bird and real love I play a lot.
Seemed like a continuance of abbey road.
Yes,they reminded me of abbey road.
More classic Beatles songs decades after they broke up.
One of a kind band.
Nothing like them will ever come along again
