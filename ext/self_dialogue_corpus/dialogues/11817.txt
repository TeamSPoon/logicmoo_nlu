Are you much of a Beatles fan?
I am. I love all of their songs and music.
I'm the same way. Favorite Beatles Album?
I would have to go with Abbey Road. So many classic hits on one album.
I agree, but I would have to pick the White Album. I like the songs on that one a litte bit better.
Yea, I like that one too. You have a favorite song by The Beatles?
I think so. It would have to either Blackbird or Imagine.
Didnt John Lennon write and sing the song Imagine?
I guess you are right. My favorite song would have to be Blackbird then.
My favorit song is Yellow Submarine. Such a catchy song.
