Have you ever seen the movie Almost Famous?
I'm not sure, maybe. What is it about?
It's about this kid who fallows around the band like a groupie.
Really? I love movies with bands in it!
Then you will love this! There is a lot of good music in it too!
What else is in the movie? Maybe ill go rent it tonight!
Well he falls in love with a real groupie while hes traveling around in the band. Her name is Penny Lane and Drew Barrymore plays her.
I love Drew Barrymore! She is such a good actress. It seems like the perfect part for her!
Right! The kid ends up writeing an article for The rolling Stones. Its based in the late 70's so the fashion is cool too!
Like bell bottoms and Afros? I cant wait to watch it then!
Even Jimmy Fallon plays a part in it!
Wow this movie keeps getting better and better!
You should come over and watch it later! I have the DVD.
I definitely can! I'm intrigued at the movie plot!
Yeah it really gives you a glimpse into the rock star lifestyle in the 1970's.
I love that. There isn't many movies about the good rock and roll music.
That is  so true, and they couldn't have picked better actors. Even Phillip Seymour Hoffman was in it and he was a great late actor.
He really was. I miss his movies! I'm sure he plays a great role like always.
Just wait until you hear the soundtrack! Elton John, Led Zeppelin, and The Who just to name a few!
Wow! I can't wait to come over and see it later!
