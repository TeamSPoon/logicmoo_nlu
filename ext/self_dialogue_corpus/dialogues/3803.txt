Did you catch that newer Brad Anderson film.
I am not sure, who is in it?
It has Kate Beckinsile.
Is that the one set in the asylum?
Yes, Stonehurst asylum.
That was so scary!
His work reminds me of classic thrillers.
What else did he make?
He made one called "Rope", so scary.
I think I saw that one, it reminded me of the older film Vertigo.
