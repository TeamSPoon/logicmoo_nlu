I was humming that song to "The Lion King" this morning.
Which one?  Hakuna matata?
Yes, it got stuck in my head while driving.
That's a good movie we should watch it later.
Yes it has been years since I saw it.
I had a plush toy "Simba" when I was growing up.
Me too!  I watched that movie so many times - my copy wore out.
I know, I had a poster of Jonathon Taylor Thomas on my wall!
Oh right.  He played Simba.
Ya, I had a huge crush on him.
