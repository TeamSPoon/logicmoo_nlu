What is your favorite song of all time?
Wow, that's amost impossible to answer. There are so many great songs.
If you had to pick one, which would it be?
It might sound silly, but I might pick 'Tale as Old as Time', the song from the movie Beauty and the Beast. I love Disney music.
That's a very pretty song, I agree.
If we're not allowed to use Disney music, then I'd maybe say 'Kiss from a Rose' by Seal.
Oh yeah, that's a great song too.
I still watch the music video of that song on Youtube from time to time.
Seal has a great voice, and that song in particular is outstanding.
What's your favorite song.
I'd pick Sinnerman, by Nina Simone.
Nina Simone had such an unusual voice.
She was remarkable.
My mother saw Nina Simone perform live. She said she was surprisingly funny, in her stage banter.
Haha, that's not what I would have expected.
She said the music was sublime, too.
That, I would expect. I think today's music is missing a lot of what Nina Simone had.
Which is what?
I think it's maybe the integrity and authenticity of following your own path.
It's true that a lot of music these days is more commerically generated.
