What do you think about the Detroit Tigers bullpen?
Ugh! It has been their downfall for years!
Did you see the game last night? I really did feel bad for Sanchez.
He sure has lost it, hasn't he? Same as K-Rod, it seems.
I feel bad for him, too, but just dreaded each time I saw him warming up in the bullpen.
I know exactly what you mean. How do you think Justin Wilson will do as the closer?
He sure can't do any worse than K-Rod was doing. He was able to do the job the other night against Arizona.
Yeah, he did a good job. Did you hear that interview they had with him following the game?
You mean when they asked him about being nervous when he had to come in and pitch the ninth?
Yeah, and he said he was more nervous than usual. That was funny. He also gave credit to the other relief pitchers for that night.
I know. There were sure a couple of deep fly balls given up by both Hardy and Greene.
True, but they ultimately got Arizona out without them scoring. So, you can't complain too much.
Yeah, you're right. What did you think of Verlander that night?
It just seems like he's been kind of struggling this whole season. He's been winning okay, though.
His velocity has sure been good. One of his strikeout pitches was 99 mph!
I know. I heard he reached a hundred a few games ago.
Yeah, he did. But it doesn't seem like his control has been there like it has been in the past.
Well, Michael Fulmer's control has sure been there!
What a pitcher! I heard him compared to a young Verlander!
He is certainly everything they said he was going to be! He's definitely had an impact on the pitching staff!
