Hey, do still listen to Metallica?
No I don't. Are they still going strong?
Yes. It's unbelievable right?
Man, those guys were awesome. But I thought they were retired.
No. They are still rocking.
Do they still sound like the old days?
They have changed their style a bit, but they still sound very good.
I have to listen to their new stuff.
You should. And then you should tell me your opinion.
What's the name of the last album?
It's called "Hardwired... to Self-Destruct"
Just the name sound heavy.
It is. They are still doing some long songs full of great guitar riffs.
I remember when we used to jam and play some of their songs.
We should deffinitely get together and play some music again.
I would be up for that.
Well, going back to the album, the song I liked the most is number 3 I believe.
Okay, I will pay special attention to that one.
Rock on my friend.
Metallica still going on inspires me.
