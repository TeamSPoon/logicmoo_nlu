Hey are you watching the singing show that Alicia Keys is one of judges?
You mean The Voice?
Yes that's the one. I was so happy when she came on as a judge. That woman blows me away every time she sings!
I agree. Even when she just sings off the cuff during practice. She is stunning.
When she first came out and she played that slow song on piano. I can't think of it right this second.
The song is "Fallin'".
Yes! Thanks! It was so different than all the other stuff on the radio at the time.
She is and was so stunning to look at and listen to.
What blew me away way the first time  heard her speak.
What do you mean?
Her singing voice is so insanely beautiful and articulate and her speaking voice is so thuggish. Well at least at the time it was.
That's funny that you got that impression!
She seems like a really sweet and kind person on the show. I have often wondered if she has kids.
Yeah she does. Two as I recall. They have very unusual names.
I'll have to look that up. I am curious.
She never ever mentions her kids or immediate family on the show. Some of the other judges do .
Well maybe she is just a super private person.
Probably a good way to be so you can have a private life and it not be tainted in a bad way by being a celebrity.
Well it's been swell talking to you!
"Swell"?? You pulled that one out of the retro word vault! Bye.
