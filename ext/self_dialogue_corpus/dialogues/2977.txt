The season is nearly about to come. I really can't wait any longer
When's the first game? First Thurs in Sept?
I think so. I forget who is playing. I know the Superbowl winner always plays opening day.
Yeah I'm not too sure about who they are playing.
Does it matter anyway? They crush everyone and everything regardless.
Let's forget about pointing out the obvious. How do you feel about the other 31 teams
Compared to the Patriots? Not too good.
Well make believe the Pats don't exist. Who would you see contending
I'm going all in and think the Chiefs may have a chance this season
You're crazy. You really think so?
I think Alex Smith is going to play out of his mind now that he is aware his end is near with them
The only way the Chiefs will progress is if they start stretching the field more.
Yeah definitely. No more of these seasons where no receivers catch a single touchdown.
That is still unreal. It feels like you almost have to try and achieve something that difficult.
Yeah. especially when your running game was going so well with Charles and West and whatnot.
You would think that would open a ton of single coverage for receivers to take advantage of
I think all they really had was Dwayne Bowe.
If he could just be consistent in catching the ball he would be such a great player. He can block and everything else.
Everything, but the most important part of his position.
Yeah, but we will see if the Chiefs finally step up to the plate this season.
