One of the theaters near me is doing The Last Five Years.
Ooh, I saw that show once!
Yeah, I remember. I wanted to ask you if it was any good.
It was excellent, as long as it's your thing.
What do you mean?
Well how into Broadway music are you?
It really depends on the style. I don't want to go see The Music Man or anything.
Oh this isn't that style at all, definitely contemporary.
That sounds like it might be more up my street. What are the songs like?
Well there are only two people in the show, a man and a woman.
Ok. It's not repetitive though is it?
Not at all! They both go through a lot during the show and the songs follow them through it.
What do you mean?
Well here's an example. At the beginning Cathy's opening song is ridiculously sad, slow, and harsh.
You're really selling this... not.
Bear with me. She's going backwards though time here so as the show goes on she gets happier and a Lot funnier.
Ok, so there's a lot of range emotionally?
Yeah. She starts off crying and then one of her last songs is this hilarious take on auditioning.
And the guy in the show's music does the same sort of thing?
Yeah, except in the other direction so there's balance, you see?
