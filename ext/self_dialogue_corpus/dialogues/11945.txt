what is the most memorable beatles song for you?
I think for me it is blackbird.
Really that is not one of the super popular ones.
I think it was a big song for them. But more than that my dad played it over and over again so really stuck with my image of them.
I would say imagine .
Wasn't that a solo work by John lennon, not really the band's song.
You may be right, I do think it is one of the most recognizable songs ever though.
Fair enough, it is a great song with a deeply important message of peace.
John was so much for peace. So sad he was assasinated.
Yes it was a tragic loss for music and the world.
