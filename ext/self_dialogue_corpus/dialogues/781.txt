Guess what?
What?
We got the NFL Sunday Ticket this year.
Great, I'm coming to watch the games.
That means I won't miss one Miami game all year.
I could also see my team too, right?
I guess so, we could split the screen.
I have to watch Tennessee.
It's weird you pick such an odd team.
Why, the Titans are good.
Yeah, I guess they are.
Delanie Walker is a good player.
I never heard of him.
Really? Not even with Fantasy Football rosters?
No.
Guess you don't pay much attention to all the NFL teams.
Actually, you're right.
Not a big fan of the team colors, but what are you going to do, right?
What are their colors?
Usually a weird powder blue.
