What's your opinion on 'Believer?'
Is that the Monkees song that was remixed by Smash Mouth?  I love both versions.
No. I am referring to the song by Imagine Dragons.
I see.  I don't know that one.
I highly recommend it.  It's quite catchy.
I think I will.  I really liked Imagine Dragon's 'Demons' and 'Radioactive.'
'Demons' is one of my favorites.
That's one of two songs I know by them, but I just love the slow tempo of it and rhythm.
The rest of the album, 'Night Visions' is just as good.
They definitely have a very unique sound.
