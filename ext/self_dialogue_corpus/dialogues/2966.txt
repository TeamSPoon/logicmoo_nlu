I used to love Deadspins why your team sucks articles
Yeah, they are pretty funny
He was so harsh with the panthers last year.
Well it all turned out to be true
Yes, they had a terrible record in 2016
I can't wait for the new ones to come out
I think the Patriots are going to dominate again this year
Unfortunately I agree even though I hate them
I wish Aaron Rogers and the packers would do better
I know or the bears would figure out their QB
Anybody will be better than Jay Cuter
All he throws are interceptions
I think Wayne Gallman is a great new running back
Who drafted him?
The New York Giants
I hate payton manning, but I don't mind Eli
Yeah Payton is a bad person
I hate that he is the better QB
Did Eli ever win a superbowl?
I'm not sure about that
