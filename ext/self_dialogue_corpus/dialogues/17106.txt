Did you ever listen to the music group Live?
Oh yeah!  I actually saw them live in concert a long time ago.
That's crazy, so did I!  They had great music, didn't they?
Yes, I remember Lightning Crashes and I Alone being amazing.
I think that was from the Throwing Copper album.  That one came out in 1994.
Yeah, that was around the time I saw them in concert.  They were great live.
Yeah, did you know they actually formed in 1980 though?
Wow, so they had already been around awhile when Throwing Copper came out?
Yeah, that was just their first really successful album.
Wow, that's a long time to go unnoticed!
Yeah, I think they changed their name to Live around 1991 and then they went on MTV and became mainstream.
Crazy, I had no idea.  What happened to them after Throwing Copper?
They had several other albums.  I think the Secret Samadhi and The Distance to Here were the names of several.
I never heard of either of those.
Yeah, they weren't as well known.  Then I believe they toured with the Counting Crows.
Oh wow, they were a great band back then, too!
I know.  Remember their song Mr. Jones?
Yeah that's the one everyone knows.
Yeah, it had a good video too.
I liked the Counting Crows!
