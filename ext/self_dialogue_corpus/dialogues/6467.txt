Hey, I just bought a new Disney movie. Do you want to borrow it?
No thanks, I am not a fan of Disney.
I thought you are a fan of Pirates movies?
I don't seem to recall any disney cartoon character that is a pirate beside Captain Hook and I am not a fan of Peter Pan.
I am talking about Pirates of the Caribbean, my friend.
Oh, I love that show! Are you sure it is a Disney movie?
Pirates of the Caribbean is produced by Walt Disney Pictures and Jerry Bruckheimer Films.
I don't know that! Do you have the on with Chow Yun-Fat in it? I am his fan!
Of course, you can drop by my place later to pick it up.
Great! I'll see you later.
