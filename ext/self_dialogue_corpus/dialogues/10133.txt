Hong Kong action flicks are the best.
John Woo is the top director in that genre, I think.
Hard Boiled was the first movie I saw in that genre.
That movie blew me away.
It really cemented Chow Yun-Fat as an action hero.
The fight sequences are shot like a ballet.
I agree. The cinematography is what makes those films.
When did you first see it?
I watched it in the early nineties.
I hope John Woo keeps making them like that for a long time.
