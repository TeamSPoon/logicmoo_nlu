Have you heard of Beat Takeshi?
No, who's that?
He's a Japanese actor and director. He was in a whole bunch of thriller movies.
Like what?
Like Battle Royale. Lots and lots of action movies.
I liked Battle Royale. It was dark though.
He was also in the new American live-action remake of Ghost in the Shell.
How was that? I never got around to seeing it.
Well, I actually thought that Scarlett Johansson was very good in it.
I like her. She's usually pretty good.
