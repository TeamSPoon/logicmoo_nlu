What kind of music are you in to?
I actually have kind of an obscure taste in music.
What do you mean?
Well, like, you've probably never heard of my favorite band.
Try me! What is it?
The Weakerthans.
Yeah you're right. Never heard of them!
They're a 90s pop punk band from Manitoba.
How did you stumble upon them?
I'm really into 90s pop punk.
Is that what you meant when you said your taste in music was obscure?
Exactly.
What are some other bands you like?
Others that aren't really popular.
You know what I'm gonna say, try me!
Ok. Mineral is a big fave too.
Never heard of them either. Third time's a charm?
Dinosaur Jr?
Yes, I actually have heard of them!
Sweet!
