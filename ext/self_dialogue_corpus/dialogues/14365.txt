Do you like Lebron James?
Yes, but I haven't always liked him.
What do you mean by that?
Well when he first came into the league, I thought he was a showboat.
I can see your point of view there.
Yeah, he just seemed to have everything given to him.
But he is so skilled, and people love to watch that.
I agree with you there, but I value humbleness, and I think he used to lack that.
So were you a fan when he left Cleveland to go to Miami?
I actually thought that was pretty funny, and I laughed at the people of Cleveland.
Wow, that's pretty mean-spirited.
Well I just thought it was pathetic for people to care that much about a basketball player.
I get it. It seems like some people took it too personally.
Yes, and it was great when he went down to Miami and won a championship.
But then he came back to Cleveland and won one for them as well.
Yes, but it took awhile. I'm sure a lot of people thought that it never would happen.
So what do you think of their team this year?
Well the Cavs always have a chance with Lebron there, so they might get it done again.
Personally, I like their chances too. They have a good all-around team to support him.
The Western Conference looks exciting this year too, so the Finals should be entertaining to watch.
