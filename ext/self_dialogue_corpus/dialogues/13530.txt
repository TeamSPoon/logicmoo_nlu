To me, the best Star Wars is the first one.
Yeah, me too, I love it!
It is still visually stunning, even after all these years.
Yes, I love the scenes when they are flying in space, it looks real!
The Death Star looks so ominous sitting there like a planet that is meant just for attacking other planets.
Hey, was the the Star Wars where they all got stuck in that garbage place?
You mean that gross room that had the walls closing in, it was compacting the trash?
Yes, and Chewy was barking about the smell!
I laughed at that, I don't know if Chewy is a dog man, a bear man or what!
Hey's he's a Chewbacca oops, I mean a Wookie!
