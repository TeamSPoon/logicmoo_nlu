What did you think of Idris Elba's performance in No Good Deed?
I think he was great. I can't say the same about the movie, though.
I guess that means you didn't like it? I thought it was good.
It started off okay, but it missed the mark in a few areas for me.
Like where?
Well, I thought that around the end it was too convenient how Henson's character escaped being tied up.
Oh, you mean how the broken glass was within reach for her?
Yeah, I think it would have been better if her daughter came in a untied her. The girl was just a prop in the whole movie.
Maybe. I still liked it.
I liked it, too. It just had some bad writing.
