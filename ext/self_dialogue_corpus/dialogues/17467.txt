Did you like Lady Gaga's last album
No not really.
Did you miss the club music
Not even that because I loved her collaboration with Tony Bennett
I wasn't sure if it was good or just a gimmick
No it was really good. I listen to it every day
Are you a Tony Bennett fan too?
Yes, Steppin Out With My Baby is my Saturday night song
Do you like all the music of that era like Sinatra?
No can't say I like Sinatra but yeah I do love big band music.
Any recommendations?
I would say Mel Torme, Peggy Lee, Dean Martin
I think Michael Buble has done covers of their songs
Yeah that is his whole act
Do you like him
His original stuff is actually okay but he butchered Comin Home and Fever
Fever is really overdone
It's a great song but you can't top Peggy Lee
What's your all time favorite Peggy Lee song?
A little known one actually called Me and My Shadow. Beautiful and so haunting.
