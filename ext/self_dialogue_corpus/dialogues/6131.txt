I love the movie Mulan.
Me too. Every time it's on tv I have to watch it.
She's such a strong character.
I know. It's so brave how she takes her father's place in the war.
That's one of my favorite scenes in the movie.
I love when she sings the song Reflection.
Me too. The song I'll Make a Man Out of You is great, as well.
I totally agree. I love when she climbs the log with the weights on and gets the arrow down.
That scene proves that girls are more than just a pretty face.
Definitely. She is a great role model.
