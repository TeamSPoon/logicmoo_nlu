I had to help out last night at the kids baseball practice.
Oh yeah, how did that go?
It was exhausting!
What?  Did you have to play with them?
Not really, but I was chasing balls and everything else!
Shouldn't the kids have chased the balls?
I thought they would have, but the coaches were trying to teach them how to properly throw and needed someone to shag the balls.
And that was you?
Yes.  And seven year old kids really can't throw.
Well, hopefully the practice helped.
Yeah, I'm hoping.  Their first game is next week.
Are the kids excited?
Oh, for sure.  But half of them really can't hit the ball.
Wow, have they ever played before?
Most of them have to an extent, but this is the first year in this league for most of them.
So they can't hit a pitched ball.
Exactly.  Next practice will be focusing on hitting I think.
Sounds like you guys need it.
Yeah.  I might take mine down to the batting cages.
That always worked for us growing up.
