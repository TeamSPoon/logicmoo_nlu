Do you listen to Lady Gaga?
I listen to them when they come on the radio.
What is your favorite song?
I really like "Alejandro." What's your favorite?
I like "Bad Romance" and "Just dance."
Ah, that was her very first song.
Do you like her new stuff?
I'm not a huge fan of those. I prefer the older songs.
Did you know she can play the piano really well?
Yes, she's a talented musician, but I've heard you have to see her live for her to really showcase it.
