You should go see it.
I probably will go see it.
The movie has been out for a while, did you not know it was out?
Yes, I knew it was out.
Why then have you not checked it out? Do you not like Quentin Tarantino's movies?
Oh yes I do like his movies.
What's the wait then.
I just did not like what I was hearing about the movie.
Hearing from friends?
Yes, from movie goers.
So your friends did not like it?
Not just my friends, the reviews were really great.
What reviews?
I read some reviews on IMDB.
Come on now, you know you cannot go by that.
That was not the only review I read
Oh yeah, which other ones did you read?
I read some reviews on Rotten Tomatoes.
I guess all I can say is give it a chance.
I think I will
