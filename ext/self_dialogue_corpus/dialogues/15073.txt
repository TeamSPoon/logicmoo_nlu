I wonder which comedy made the most money?
Of all time? Global revenues?
Yes. of all time globally, which comedy film, a single or a franchise, has made the most money?
Easy. The Shrek series. Made over 1.4 billion.
All that for a green whatever he is.
He's an ogre.
If we don't count the sequels. which movie made the most?
Also easy, 1984 Ghost busters. Over 600 million adjusted for inflation.
That was a great movie. The ruined it by remaking it...
And it wasn't even funny. Just stupid men hating misandrists. A lot of people hated it.
