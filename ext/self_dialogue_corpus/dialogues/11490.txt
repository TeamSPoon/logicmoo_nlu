You know who I have really been getting into lately?
Who is that?
The Beatles. They are so timeless.
Well you know that I am a huge fan.
What is your favorite song?
Really? Just one?
All time favorite song, go!
All time I guess I would have to say The Long and Winding Road. It reminds me of my dad.
That is a good one. I really like another cliche one, Let it Be.
It may be cliche, but it is so good.
