Do you create a lot of music playlists on your iPhone?
Yea I've got a lot of lists.
Me too. I use Apple Music a lot.
I do too.
I have the family plan.
What's that.
Well my wife and granddaughter are on my phone account so now they can have access to Apple Music.
That's cool because you can get anything on Apple.
Yes you can.
Anything new that comes out is readily available right?
Yes,once it's released.
That's really worth it.
My granddaughter loves it because it seems theirs new rap music out everyday.
Oh god I know.
She's always downloading new music.
I don't like that stuff but it's good for her.
It is good for her,like it or not.
Every body has their own taste.
That's true and that's why I like Apple because you can get everything.
Everything imaginable.
