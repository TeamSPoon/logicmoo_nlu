Who is your favorite actor in "2 Fast 2 Furious"?
Well, I like Ludacris who plays Tej because of his smooth acting skills.
Ludacris is cool but I am more interesting in the skills of Tyrese Gibson who plays Roman Pierce.
Tyrese is very smooth in his acting skills and he has been acting for a while now.
I also like the story line the movie. Do you remember what happened to Carter the drug dealer?
Yes, doesn't he get arrested at the end while trying to get away from the cops?
Yes, that is right. He was a very smooth actor as well. What is his real name?
I believe his real name is Cole Hauser. I have seen him like a couple of movies since he played in this one.
Can you imagine having a house like he did in the movie? Such a big house and all the cars he had.
Tell me about it. I will one day be living like him.
