I just read that American Idol is returning.
Really? That show helped discover so many good singers.
Kelly Clarkson has had such a great carrier.
One of my all time favorite songs is Because of You.
Even though he didn't win, Clay Aiken has had a very successful carrier.
I know. His Measure of a Man hit #1 on the Billboard chart.
Fantasia is another singer from Idol who has had a lot of success.
Don't forget about Carrie Underwood.
I think she's won around seven Grammy Awards.
You know who is one of my favorite American idol singers is?
Who?
Adam Lambert.
He can sing anything and it sounds good.
I loved it when he sang Play That Funky Music on the show.
Then he went on to be the lead singer for Queen.
He's perfect for the band the way he hits the high notes.
Not all singers on the show have had success.
No, but it's a good starting point.
Are you planning on watching the new season?
You better believe it.
