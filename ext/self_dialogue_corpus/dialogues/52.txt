Have you seen the movie Hancock, with Will Smith?
I absolutely love that movie!
It's hilarious, especially how hes just a drunk but he ends up saving people.
I really like that movie a lot, but my favorite super hero movie is The Punisher.
Oh man, I love that movie too!
Do you remember the part with the Russian?
The huge muscular dude that tries to kill The Punisher? Yeah I remember him.
That scene was so crazy, how he got hot soup thrown in his eyes and melted his face.
Yeah it was awesome how he just pulled the knife out of his shoulder like it was nothing.
Haha, That dude was absolutely crazy. Then The Punisher just throws him off the stairs and kills him.
