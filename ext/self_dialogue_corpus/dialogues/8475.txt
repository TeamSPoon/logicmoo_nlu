Who are some of your favorite pop artists?
Hmm, well I really like Sufjan Stevens and Neutral Milk Hotel
Oh, so you're into the indie stuff huh?
Yeah, mostly. What about you?
I like indie stuff as well, but also like all kinds of stuff as far back as the 60's and 70's like Don McLean and the Beatles
I love the Beatles too. I'm not as familiar with Don McLean as you probably are though.
Not many people are! I'm a huge fan
What did he do besides American Pie?
Well tons of stuff, but his most famous ones would probably be Starry Starry night, aka Vincent
oh right, i know that one. Beautiful song.
