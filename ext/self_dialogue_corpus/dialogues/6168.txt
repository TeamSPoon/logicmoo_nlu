Did you ever see Monsters Inc?
I didn't get a chance to watch it all the way through but from what I saw it was good.
I think they came out with a sequel called Monsters University right?
Yeah I think they went off to college in that one.
That's a cute series. My kids are more into the Toy Story franchise.
So am I and I'm an adult. They're really creative and fun movies.
On part 3 when Andy went away to college and played with the toys for the last time I cried my eyes out.
That was really a touching moment. He passed them down to a little girl.
Barbie and Ken were hilarious in that movie.
That's for sure, they took the movie in my opinion.
