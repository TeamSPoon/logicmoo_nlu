Fantasia is the weirdest Disney movie ever.
That's the one where Mickey Mouse is a wizard right.
Yeah, it's got that iconic scene where he's trying to use magic to clean his castle.
And then all the brooms go crazy and start doing a weird army march.
And the castle ends up flooding because he uses too much magic or something like that.
It's got a really fantastic musical score as well, but I agree it's totally weird.
Doesn't Mickey Mouse's dog, Pluto, make a totally out of place cameo appearance.
I think so but I can't remember too much about it.
Ha ha me neither but I always used to listen to the soundtrack to fall asleep.
Ha ha that's almost as weird as the film itself.
