I LIKE THE BLUES
WHAT ARTISTS
I LIKE B.B KING, BO DIDLY, MUDDY WATERS
I LIKE RUFUS  THOMAS,JOHN LEE HOOKER AND BIG MAMA THORTON
THE BLUES ARE THE BASIS FOR OUR ROCK AND ROLL.
ALSO GOSPEL MUSIC CONTRIBUTED TO IT
THE BLUES STARTED IN THE HOUSE OF ILL REPUTE BY PIANO PLAYERS PLAYING BOOGIE WOOGIE
FAT'S DOMINOE'S ' I HEAR YOU KNOCKING WAS PLAYED IN THOSE KIND OF PLACES
THEY HAD TO REWRITE THE LYRICS OR THE PEOPLE IN THE FIFTIES WOULD HAVE FAINTED.
SOME OF THEM PROBABLY WOULD HAVE DESERVED IT
WHITE PEOPLE STOLD A LOT OF THE BLACK MUSIC
ALL OF JERRY LEE LEWIS'S MUSIC WAS TAKEN FROM BLACK MUSIC
ELVIS WAS A WHITE GUY WHO SANG BLACK MUSIC
IN THE OLD DAYS THE RADIO WAS SEGREGATED
THERE WERE WHITE STATIONS AND BLACK STATIONS
WHAT A WACKY SYSTEM
I THINK THE BLUES FIT IN WITH REAL LIFE
THERE ARE ALWAYS GOOD TIMES AND BAD
IF WE DIDN'T HAVE BLACK PEOPLE WE WOULDN'T HAVE THE BLUES OR ROCK
WE WOULD PROBABLY JUST HAVE OPERA AND CLASSICAL MUSIC - HOW HIDEOUS
