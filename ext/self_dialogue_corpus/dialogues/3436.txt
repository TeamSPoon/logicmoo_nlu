Can you recommend a good horror movie to watch?
A movie I like a lot is called Session 9.
Is that a new movie or an older movie?
Well it depends on what you consider new. It was made in 2001.
Are there a lot of jump scares in the movie?
No, there aren't many. It's not really that type of movie but it is very creepy.
Is it a supernatural horror movie?
Well I don't want to spoil it too much but the movie very much leaves that an open question for interpretation.
What is something unique about Session 9?
The majority of the movie takes place during the day. Not all of it but a large chunk of the movie does.
