Hey is it football season yet?
Man I know it, I am so ready!
I think the draft went really well for Dallas this year, don't you?
Yea they got that defensive end from Michigan in the 1st round, right?
Yea they got Charlton in the first round and Awuzie in the second.
I can not wait to see how they perform in California in training!
I am ready to see who lands in Quarterback this season.
I think that is a no brainer after what happened last year.
Do you think they will make it to the superbowl this year?
I think they have a good shot!
If they can win out the East I think they should also.
I know I am tired of the Patriots always winning.
I hear that. I think if the Cowboys can get there they have a good shot.
The first home game is mid-August. I didn't know if you wanted to go or not?
I think I would like to see how they do in training camp and maybe wait for a few games.
They always seem to play better once they get the hang of everything and everyone.
I can not wait to see what Dak brings to the field this year.
Man last year was crazy when he and Zeke was just killing everyone.
Oh I was loving see them run all over the teams at the games.
Just like old times with Irving and Aikman!
