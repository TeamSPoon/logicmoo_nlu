Have you seen Fury?
Is that the Brad Pitt movie with the tanks set during World War 2?
Yes that's the movie. Shia LaBeouf, Logan Lerman, Jon Bernthal, and Michael Pena are also in there.
What other movies has Jon Bernthal been in? I know the other actors.
He was in Wolf of Wallstreet, remember he was the one with the European girlfriend who was smuggling in the goods with her through luggage.
Oh that's right! He was the tough guy who hated Jonah Hill's character.
He's been getting a lot of roles of late. He was really good in Fury as one of the four that was in Brad Pitt's tank.
I really liked that movie. I haven't seen a movie do tank warfare as well as that one. It was really intense watching those tank battles against the Axis forces.
I liked the team aspect and character growth of the characters. Especially with Logan's character. I always feel he's under appreciated as a young actor.
Logan's really good at playing the quiet, meek, characters. I feel it suits his true persona well.
He was really good in Perks of Being a Wallflower.
That's the movie based off the book and it stars Emma Watson too right?
Yeah Emma Watson was really good in there, it was good to see her doing something after all the Hermione Granger roles from Harry Potter.
I think she's a good actress too but I might be biased because I'm a huge Harry Potter fan.
I want to see her do more action films, she does a lot of serious drama's and more time period pieces.
She was in this Ethan Hawke movie called Regression, it was really suspenseful.
I haven't heard of that one, was it any good?
It was interesting. I enjoyed it, but it wasn't a routine crime movie. It had some horror elements.
That's sounds intriguing. I think I'll have to look that up because I love Ethan Hawke too. Should be good to see how they perform together.
It's kind of a hard movie to watch because she's a victim, and then something else. I want ruin it, but check it out for yourself.
