I just watched the original Star Wars last night.Did you ever see that one?
Not the whole movie, just bits and pieces on T.V..
You should rent it. I think George Lucas had no clue what he was starting with that movie.
How old were you when that came out?
I was only eleven. It came out in 1977.
Wow, that is an oldie. I saw one of the newer ones called The Clone Wars.
I saw them all. That was good but you could tell Lucas had nothing to do with it.
I guess I would have to see them all to tell the difference. How many movies all together?
I think there were at least ten movies. I could be wrong.
The Force Awakens was supposed to be good too.
