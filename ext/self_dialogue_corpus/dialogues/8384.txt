I don't know about you, but I cannot stop listening to the new Lorde album!
Oh, I know! Melodrama is one of the best albums I have ever heard.
I'm not usually into pop, but this album really changed that for me.
I think its because she really bared her soul to everyone in this album. You feel like she's singing directly to you about her life.
I wasn't a huge fan of Pure Heroine when that first came out, but the more I listened to it the more it grew on me.
Did you see the episode of South Park where they parodied her?
No I didn't. Was it funny?
Oh god yes, it was hysterical. You have to watch it!
What's the name of the episode?
There were two main episodes, though the role was reoccurring, they were  The Cissy and #REHASH
