Frozen is a great Disney movie, but I actually thought Tangled was better.
Really?  I loved Frozen!
Don't get me wrong.  I liked Frozen, too, but I thought it was a little over-hyped.
I have never seen Tangled, so I wouldn't know.
You are missing out!  It's adorable!
Isn't it the story of Rapunzel?
Yes.  She's a teenager who grew up thinking the woman who raised her was her mother...but she wasn't!
Frozen has a talking snowman though...
Yeah, well Tangled has a funny horse named Maximus.
I'll watch it and be the judge as to which is better!
