Do you like the Beatles?
I don't know many songs, but I like them.
What songs do you know? The major hits?
Yeah, like Help, All You Need Is Love, etc.
Great songs. I think All You Need Is Love should be the world anthem.
That would be great! What are your favorite Beatles songs?
I really like I Wanna Hold Your Hand and She Came In Through The Bathroom Window
The Bathroom Window? Now that is funny! I've never heard that one.
It's such a great song! They have so many original titles and lyrics.
I will have to listen to that one for sure.
