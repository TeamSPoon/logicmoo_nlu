How do you think the Browns wll do this year
I like their draft picks,
I do too but they need to start them,
True, You know they are not going anywhere this year but the rookies need experience
I agree, Now to just see who will be quarterback
I just hope The Steelers do well
Me too but Ben is getting older
yeah and beat up all the time, The talent is there at least on offense
yeh, they have not lived up to the defenses of the past in Pittsburgh lately
I just hope the Patriot don't repeat
I don't like Brady
Me either, I am just tired of seeing them in the Super Bowl all the time
Me too, I also hate seeing the Cowboys and Greenbay every Sunday on TV
Me too, They get old, but I do like Prescott
I hope Prescott does well, He was impressive as a rooking
I want to see what Atlanta can do, Hope they can match the success they had last year.
I still root for Seattle and Minnesota, Always something about those teams
I'm like that with Arizona.
Just hiope the season isn't lame, The game isn't like it used to be
No it's not.
