What are your thoughts on Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 and Part 2?
I enjoyed the, I was sad to see the series end. But of course knew it had to at some point.
The series certainly spanned a long time. I find them slightly too dark.
They are dark but it is based off the books and I mean they had to start making them more adult.
I don't know that more adult equals darker, but I get what you are saying.
Did you know that in the one scene where Helena Bonham Carter is writing mudblood on Hermione they show it one one arm but then next shot it is on the other?.
Helena Bonham Carter character was Bellatrix Lestrange correct? And no I had never caught that.
Yes that is her Bellatrix Lestrange. What a good name for her role. It fits the character so well.
I think J.K. Rowling was great in her inventive effectiveness in naming all characters.
True even the simple name Ron is so perfect for his part.
