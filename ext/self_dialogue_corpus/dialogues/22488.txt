Something weird I noticed about movies recently?
What, that they still make them? Did you think YouTube would replace films?
No, nothing like that. It's just, it seems like some years nothing good comes out.
That can't be true, there have got to be at least a few good films every year.
Well, of course, but I mean more like summer action flicks and stuff; blockbusters and whatnot.
There's your problem. You've got to expand your horizons. Watch something other than cape flicks.
Yeah, yeah, but just listen. It's like, some years the summer movie season is just awful.
What is coming out this year?
You know, standard stuff. A few kids movies, a few superhero films, and sequels like Transformers, Pirates, and Planet of the Apes.
I kind of see where you're coming from. If big summer movies are what you're into, then yeesh.
It feels like everything's getting homogenized, and even then slightly unique films we get like Ghost in the Shell come out early in the year and bomb.
Heck, and even that was an anime adaption! No points for originality there!
Yep. Then you've got a few comedies and horror films here and there, and that's it.
That's it? For the entire summer?
Up to August, yeah. After that you start getting the films the studios didn't have a lot of faith in and just need to push out.
So these, these movies we're getting now are the cream of the crop?
I guess so. Then come September and October it'll be mostly horror films.
Like I said, pal, gotta expand your horizons. Digital only films are where truly original tales are being spawned.
Ugh, but that sounds so boring!
Says the guy complaining about all movies being bland and the same these days! Ha!
