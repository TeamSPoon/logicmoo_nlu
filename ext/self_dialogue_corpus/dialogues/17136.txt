Do you ever listen to The Beatles?
Are you joking? Who doesn't love the Beatles?
Good point, they were a great band.
They certainly were.
So many good songs to choose from.
What's your favorite song?
Paperback Writer will always be my favorite.
That's a good one. I love Dear Prudence.
Oh yeah I forgot about that one.
yeah their White album is a great one.
Weird to think it was one of their last ones.
Such a shame. After Lennon died it just went downhill.
No getting back together after that.
No chance. Paul seems to be doing ok though.
Yeah I'm sure he's fine with his millions.
Same thing with Ringo.
Said that George died a few years back as well.
Yeah they're getting pretty old.
I'll always still treasure their music though.
Their music will live on forever.
