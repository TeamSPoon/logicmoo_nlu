Have you heard of Kidneythieves?
No, I haven't. What kind of music are they?
They're a rock band, but not hard rock. More like industrial rock. They sound a little like Sneaker Pimps, back when they still had a female singer.
Really? When were they founded?
I think it was 1998. Their first song was "S+M (A Love Song)" and their first album was "Trickster".
Still doesn't ring a bell. I'll have to check them out sometime.
If you do. you should definitely listen to the song "K" first. It's a really great song.
Ok, I will. Is there anything else you can tell me about them?
Well, one of their songs was featured in the movie "Queen of the Damned" in 2002. It was called "Before I'm dead".
Not sure if I remember that movie too well.
They also had some other soundtrack contributions too, like the song "Crazy" in "Bride of Chucky" and the video game "Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance" with the song "A Stranger I Remain".
Oh ok I think I remember the song from Bride of Chucky! That was a great movie!
Let's not get off track here. Speaking of video games, they also had selected songs from one of their albums, Trickster, featured in "Deus Ex: Invisible War".
That's really cool. Who is the lead singer?
Her name is Free Dominguez. She has a beautiful voice. She actually contributed vocals to the third Conjure One album, "Exilarch" on the song "Run for Cover" and her backing vocals are on Zeromancer's album "Clone Your Lover".
Awesome. Can you compare their type of sound to any other bands?
Like I said, they sound a lot like Sneaker Pimps when Kelly Dayton was vocalist. They also sound kind of like In This Moment.
Ok, I've heard of them. They're a great band. I actually first heard them on the game Rock Band.
I love Rock Band! I can play on Expert guitar.
Well, aren't you special?
