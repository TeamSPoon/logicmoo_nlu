I watched The Lego Movie last night, you have got to see it!
Which one, the Batman one?
No, this was the original that came out in 2014.  I haven't seen the Batman one yet but I want to now.
How was the original? I haven't seen it.
It was great!  It stars Chris Pratt and Will Ferrell and it's really funny.
I heard it was pretty good.  I've been meaning to see it.
You should.  It has a slightly slow start, but once it gets going you'll really get into it.
What is it about?
There's this Lego construction worker who thinks he's "special" and he's trying to stop the Lego World from being glued together permanently.
That sounds weird.
No, it's not as bizarre as it sounds.  It turns into sort of a hero adventure, and he meets a lot of neat characters on the way.
Is there a bad guy?
Yeah, there's some evil villain that he's trying to stop.  He bands up with a lot of others to help.
That sounds pretty interesting.
Yeah, and it's funny too.  It also has a good moral at the end.
Well I'll have to check it out.  I've been wanting to see the Batman one but I'll watch this one first.
Yeah, Batman is in this one.  He's a pretty major character.
Oh, so I guess it's a sequel
I guess so, but I'm not sure.
I'll watch it and let you know.
