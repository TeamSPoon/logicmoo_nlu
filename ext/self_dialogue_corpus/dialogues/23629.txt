Have you ever seen The Goonies?
Yeah, I really like that movie.
It's my favorite movie ever.
It's hard to believe Mikey went on to be in Lord of the Rings.
Sean Astin has been in a lot of great roles.
Did you ever play the Goonies video game?
No, but I played the sequel on NES. That was one of the first video games I ever played.
That one was weird.
Yeah, you had to rescue a mermaid and beat up an eskimo with a hammer. But it's not like the movie wasn't weird.
Yeah, it was an 80s movie. Richard Donner did a good job directing it, though.
Very little of the awkward blue screening like in Superman.
I remember seeing Goonies on the Disney channel once and thinking I was watching a sequel because they added in some deleted scenes.
I remember that. They cut out anything vulgar or dubbed over it, but put in a bunch of new scenes.
I used to have a recording of it on VHS, but misplaced it over the years.
I actually have Goonies on VHS, DVD, and Blu Ray. One for every generation. If I can find a Laserdisc version, I would probably get that too.
Do you even own a Laserdisc player?
No, but it would be a nice collectible.
I guess so.
At least we can always see the movie. It's on TV constantly.
It sure is.
