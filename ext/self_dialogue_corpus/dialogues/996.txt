Who do you like in the NFL this year?
Man, the Patriots are tough but they can't win it every year!
I like the Cowboys to get to the Superbowl.
I don't know. Dak Prescott had a great rookie season, but opponents started figuring him out late in the season.
Maybe, but he's young and has time to develop.
I guess but if you keep in in the pocket his accuracy is poor.
I think the NFC East is the strongest division. The winner probably comes from those teams.
The Redskins will be okay if they're able to sign their QB Cousins.
They're kind of in a similar situation with the Cowboys. Is their defense strong enough?
Also, their offensive line is inconsistent.
Eagles? Good young QB and a strong defense!
I could see them doing well. They signed Alshon Jeffrey from the Bears this off season. He had 80 catches for Chicago recently.
I just don't see the Eagles doing much. They lost their two starting cornerbacks to free agency and I think they'll start two rookies.
Plus, Carson Wentz seems to be struggling with his throwing mechanics. He may not blossom at QB.
That leaves the Giants. Eli Manning already has two SuperBowl rings!
Yeah, but he throws too many interceptions and he's, well, old, aged, past his prime.
Eli didn't have a great year last year - not much talent on offense other than Beckham - but he averaged over 400 yards passing and had 25 touchdowns.
He will have a little more talent surrounding him this year. And the Defense was in the Top 5.
Hmm, tough to say. Hope somebody other than New England wins it.
Yeah, I'm tired of hearing all the talk of Brady being the Greatest of All Time.
