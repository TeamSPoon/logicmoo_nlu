Are you a fan of horror movies?
There are a few coming out this year.
Did you see there is a new Saw coming out?
I think it is like Saw 8 or something.
Do you think it will be as good as the old ones?
I think it will be just as suspenseful.
The guy who played Saw, died right?
Carl Elwyes?
Yes, I mean the character he plays not the actor.
I wonder how the plot will progress.
There is never really a strong plot.
I think the draw is usually just a lot of suspense.
And gore.
Did you like the older ones?
I did when the first one came out.
It was pretty ground breaking at the time.
It was so scary when I first saw it.
I think Paranormal Activity is really similar.
The jump scare stuff you mean?
Yes, the kind that makes the audience jump and scream,
