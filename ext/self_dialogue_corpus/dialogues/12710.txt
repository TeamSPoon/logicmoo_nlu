Do you think the older movies are better than the new ones?
Well, now that depends.  Are you talking about the force awakens or episode 1 through 3?
I'm talking about episode 1 through 3.
Then, no, I don't think they are better.
You at least have to have a favorite character from them.
Yeah.  Although Yoda's epic light-saber duel was pretty cool, I have to say that Jar Jar Binks is my favorite character.
No way! Have you read the fan fiction about how Jar Jar is really a Jedi?
Yes, and I think its garbage.  However, Jar Jar did play a controversial role in helping young Skywalker.
Now there is a dark character.  It's too bad that things didn't work out with Padme.
Yes, anger turned him to the dark-side, which prevented their relationship from really taking off.
