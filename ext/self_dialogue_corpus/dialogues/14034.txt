Did you like Lady Gaga's first album?
Is that the one with Just Dance?
Yes, it is.
I absolutely love that album.  I can listen to it all the way through.
I am the same way!
I can pretty much listen to everything she puts out.
Some songs are definitely misses with me.  But for the most part, they are all great.
I think she's the greatest singer of our generation.
Oh definitely!  Beyonce is great, too.
But she's no Gaga!
