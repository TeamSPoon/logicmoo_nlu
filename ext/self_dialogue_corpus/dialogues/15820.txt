Shostakovich is intense, man.
Is it? I don't know much about this stuff.
You got to check out his string quartets. They'll bite your nose off.
Can't miss that, can I. Why do they do such a thing?
Well, you know how all important art comes out of adversity. There was a ton of adversity here.
I thought that starving artist stereotype was largely disproven, all things considered.
That's not really what I mean, though. I mean, the people with the most to say tend to be saying it for a purpose -- in response to something intense in their lives that can't go uncommented upon.
Okay, so what was going on in this guy's life?
Well, he was a Jewish academic in the top tiers of society in the middle of Stalin-era Soviet Russia. His friends kept quietly disappearing, one after another.
Oh. Yes, that would tend to bother a person.
He was freaked out. For years, every moment of every day it was, are they going to bang on the door?
So that's all in his music?
Basically, yeah. He created a motif that represented him, using his initials in the German style of notation, and put it through hell.
So he's like the Trent Reznor of classical music?
Well... I don't know about that, but it was some virtuosic stuff. At least, on a compositional level.
So he didn't tour around and play the stuff himself?
Not so far as I know. He just dabbled with his piano, in his study, with his head in one hand, trying not to tremble too badly.
I think you're selling me. What did you say to look for, a... string quartet?
Yeah, I know -- but it's more interesting than you think, seriously. At least, if it's played well -- like by the Kronos Quartet.
And if it's played poorly, what happens? Does the KGB catch up with him at last?
