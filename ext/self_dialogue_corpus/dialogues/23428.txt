Hey.  What have you been up to?
I've been watching some older comedies.
Anything good in particular?
I just saw the three 'Rush Hour' movies.
I always enjoyed those movies.  Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan were a great comedic duo.
I think the second one was the best.  Three was probably the weakest.
I agree with that.  Paris was a cool setting for the third film, but the writing wasn't as good.
Do you have any suggestions for other comedies?
Have you seen 'Tropic Thunder?'  I personally enjoy satire movies like that, more so than Buddy-cop movies like 'Rush Hour.'
I actually never got around to watching that movie.  What are some of the satirical elements?
Well, the movie really skewers Hollywood and the Entertainment Industry.
That sounds interesting.  Anything more specific about it?
So for instance, it makes fun of the degree to how seriously actors take their roles.
Was there anyone in it that I'd know?
You would know most of the cast.  The cast includes, Tom Cruise, Robert Downey Jr., Jack Black, and Matthew McConaughey.
That's a star-studded cast.
Additionally, Downey and Cruise both received nominations at the Golden Globes for Best Supporting Actor.
That's impressive.  I think it's cool that a comedy has a message and is also that funny.
You will really enjoy it.  Don't forget to watch the faux trailers in the beginning of the movie as well.
I will be sure not to miss them.  Thank you for the movie suggestion.
