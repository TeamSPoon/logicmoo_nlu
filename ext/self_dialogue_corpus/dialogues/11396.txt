You know who the best band ever is?
Well, thats pretty bold. But sure, tell me.
The Beatles. Without a doubt, hands down the best band ever.
Well, it would be hard to argue with you there.
I mean, there is not other band that influenced a generation so much.
Not just a generation, they are still influencing people today.
There music just speaks to people in all walks of life.
It is a shame that they broke up when they did.
Who knows, it may have been for the best.
I guess it was just there time to end. They had a good run.
