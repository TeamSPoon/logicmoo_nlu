What's your favorite Adam Sandler movie?
Oh geez.  Do I have to name one?
There's got to be one you don't think is that bad.
I guess I'd say Happy Gilmore.
I was thinking the same thing.  That or Billy Madison.
Both are good bets.  He hasn't made a good movie forever.
Little Nicky, Waterboy, what stinkers.
And you didn't even mention Big Daddy or Grown Ups.
Too many bad movies to count.
Guess that's why he's on Netflix only right now.
