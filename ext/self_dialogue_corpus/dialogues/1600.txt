What do you think about the Patriots coach?
He is alright
I always think about the year they cheated
That was odd
They did not deserve the title
I am glad they lost the title
Me too
That was an epic game
The one against the Giants?
Yes
I cannot believe the Giants won
They had to
Really?
If the Patriots won, it would have been the biggest disappointment ever.
I agree
You cannot cheat to win
There is probably other cheating people do
I bet
Do you think steroids should be illegal in the NFL?
Of course
