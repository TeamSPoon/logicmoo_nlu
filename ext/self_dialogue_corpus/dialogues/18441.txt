I loved No Doubt when I was a kid.
I did too. I miss 1990's music
I also liked Hanson
Mmbop was a really good pop hit
Did you like boy bands?
Not so much I was more into Green Day and Smashing Pumpkins.
Green Day's Dookie was a great album
Definitely makes me nostalgic
Did you like Rap music then?
Oh yes. 2 Pac was my jam
I liked Biggie too
He was also great.
I didn't like Puff Daddy though
No. he was a little too pop
And that song he put out after Biggie Smalls' death seemed in poor taste
Oh for sure
Sting seemed to like it though
That song had nothing to do with death though
Nope. But music can change
I suppose it can.
