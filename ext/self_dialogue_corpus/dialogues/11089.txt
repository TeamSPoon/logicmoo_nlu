Do you know what is the color of the year 2017, Deon?
Yeah. They are calling it greenery.
Greenery?
They says greenery is symbolic of new beginnings.
Because of spring and grass growing and stuff like that, right?
Yeah, but why did you say it like that?
Like what?
Like you don't like the color of green.
Because I don't like green.
How can you not like green? Greenery is natureâ€™s neutral.
True but I like reds and pink.
Greenery is also emblematic of the pursuit of personal passions and vitality. Green is life.
I hear you but nah, I don't like it.
Pair a green button up shirt with a pair of black jeans and green bow in your hair and you will be stunning.
Do you think so? You aren't just saying that?
Green is a good color. It goes with just about anything.
Why aren't you wearing green ?
I am. Look at my peridot bracelet.
Wow! That is a gorgeous piece of jewelry.
Thanks.
