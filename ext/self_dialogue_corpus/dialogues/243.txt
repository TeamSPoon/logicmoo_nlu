How did you like Wonder Woman?
I think it was great.
Did you think he was a show on feminism?
Not at all, it was about a heroine thats all.
Hope Hollywood is ready for that.
The numbers at the box office say so.
Im glad to see people embracing it.
Me too but I think those walls have been broken down.
I dont see it and believe that either.
Well a superhero doesnt have to be a guy every time.
