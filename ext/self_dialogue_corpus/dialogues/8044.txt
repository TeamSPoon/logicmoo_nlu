is michael jackson still the king of pop, or is it someone else?
I think michael jackson will always be THE king of pop.
fair enough. but, who would you say is the reigning pop star right now?
maybe bruno mars. he's always entertaining
I like him a fair amount, but i'm not a huge fan of his funky pop
agreed. but he executes it well.
who else do you think is capturing the pop spotlight?
definitely katy perry
I would have definitely agree a year or two ago, but she seems to have dropped off a bit
she did, but she is coming back again!
