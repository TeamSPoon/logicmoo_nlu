Did you get to see Sleater-Kinney last year when they came out of retirement to go on tour?
What?! They're back together again.
Yeah, the put out a new album and have been touring and on TV.
I thought that chick was just doing the portlandia show.
She was a member of Sleater-Kinney long before that show
I know, I know, so whats the album called.
No cities to Love
Is it like their other albums
Its got their sound for sure, but they really came back with some new stuff.
Like what?
Like they added a bassist to some of the songs.
No more guitar, vocals and drums huh.
No there's that too, but they are trying new sounds as well.
Is Janet still drumming for them?
Yeah, she is still amazing, she kills it on every song.
Man, she's so good, and i heard she's fifty.
She certianly doesn't look it and she doesn't play like it; if anythign she's better.
Better?! alright, I am gonna down load this album right now.
Yeah, do it now and then you can listen to it on the way home.
Good idea, I'll rock out to it on the subway tonight.
