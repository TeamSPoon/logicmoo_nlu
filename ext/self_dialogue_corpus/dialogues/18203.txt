So what decade do you think was the best for music?
The decade that produced the best music was the eighties in my opinion.
Really? That is strange because I was thinking the same thing!
There were so many great artists' that were discovered in that decade.
Tell me about it! Micheal Jackson really blew up in the eighties like nobody else.
Yea there is no debating that. However, there were many other great performers throughout that era as well.
Many of them are very underrated to this day in my opinion.
I used to love Blondie. I thought she had some great songs back in the day.
Me to! I used to love that song Call Me.
That was probably her biggest hit. Did you ever hear that song The Tide Is High?
I think so; Blondie actually started her career in the seventies. She even puts out music to this day!
That is a very long career that she has had! What other eighties music do you remember?
I used to love a lot of music from Queen also. Are you familiar with them?
I remember their song Another One Bites The Dust really well.
That was a great song! Their most famous song however was We Are The Champions.
I agree with you on that one. Under Pressure was another good song that they had.
It sure was, did you ever listen to any songs from Duran Duran?
I sure did! I loved that song Hungry Like The Wolf.
That was a really good one. I also liked A View To a Kill.
They do not make music like they used to, that is for sure!
