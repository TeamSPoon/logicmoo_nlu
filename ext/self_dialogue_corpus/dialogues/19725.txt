Have you heard the new Eminem song?
No, I haven't.  Is he still popular these days?
Yes he is.  His new song is brilliant.
Is there a good melody incorporated into the song?
Yes.  The melody is from an old Queens song, we are the champions.
Sounds cool.
It is.  And he adds he awesome lyrics which sounds like poetry.
I look forward to listening to it.
It has a political theme.  Something to really make you think.
So, it makes you reflect on current events?
Sort of.  His message is enlightening for today's youth.
I just hope it doesnt make kids get angry and start to protest.
No, its not intented for that.  The chorus of the song gave me the chills.
He has that kind of effect on me as well.
I really like a part in the beginning.  Its just a piano playing 3 chords and he is rapping.
Cool.  Does he play the piano as well?
I don' think so, but he is pretty talented.
I like when he raps very powerfully and quickly towards the ending of a song.  Such intensity.
I agree.  Just be on the lookout for that song.  You will love it.
Ok. Sounds good.  Thanks for the heads up.
