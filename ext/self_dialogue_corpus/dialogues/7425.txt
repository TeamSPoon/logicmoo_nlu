I loved the Disney movie Little Mermaid.
Oh me too, Ariel was wonderful.
That was a story based on a book by Hans Christian Anderson.
Yes, it was called The Mermaid.
Ursalla was my favorite villan.
Yea she was mean, and all that black ink that came out of her was cool.
It had beautiful animation.
It really did!
Ariel wanted to be human.
Yea and I want to be a mermaid, we could switch.
