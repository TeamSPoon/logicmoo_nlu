DId you ever think that you would see those two acting in a movie of this caliber together?
Which one of them?
The only ones who matter- Kurt Russel and Samuel L. Jackson.
I guess I never really thought about it.
That's the point. It's like suddenly seeing Dwayne Johnson and Adam Sandler together.
I don't think that would be a movie worth watching- are you trying to tell me that The Hateful Eight is not worth watching?
No, I think it is an uncanny pair up. You get to see Russel's hard nose attitude and his sense of justice exist in a world of prejudice and divisions.
Hasn't he acted is westerns before though?
Yeah, but there was never a distinct tone of slavery in his movies- not that I cam remember anyway.
So that's what made the movie great, slavery?
No, once you have a post civil war setting and a badass like Jackson, you get a no holds bar character who leaves little to chance and who is keen as can be.
So the two play off of each other- it sort of sounds like a cop movie.
It sort of is. Jackson plays a dishonored soldier in the movie, and Russel plays as the muddy arm of the law, a gunslinger who bring fugitives to justice.
What are they trying to do in the movie?
Well they both have bounties which they are trying to collect.
So they are hunting people?
No, when we come into the movie, they already got their quarry. Jackson has a pile of dead men, and Russel is escorting Leigh to a town where she will be hung.
That sounds gruesome, but this is a Tarantino film, so I guess it is par for the course.
Yeah, and it is not lost on anyone. Everyone keeps mentioning how distasteful it is to hunt down a woman so she can be hung.
Is Russel's character sympathetic to Leigh- remember how soft he was initially in Tombstone?
