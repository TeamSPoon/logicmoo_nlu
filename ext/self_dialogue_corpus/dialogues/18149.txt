WHat do you like as far as music is concerned
I love Michael Buble
really his music sounds old
its not old it is classic
what do you like about his songs
I like that he has brought back the old sounds and has found an audience with all ages
what songs do you like that he does
Haven't Met You Yet
I dont know that I have heard that one
look it up and listen to it
I will any other suggestions
It's a Beautiful Day
any others
Some Kind of Wonderful
can I stream those
I would imagine or buy them from Amazon
I may try him again, it would be something new
he is refreshing
not someone I would normally listen to but I will try
let me know what you think
