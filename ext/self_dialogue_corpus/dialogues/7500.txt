What did you think of Goblet of Fire?
It was really good.  These movies seem to get better and better with each one.
Yeah, the fight scenes and action took a big step forward.
It was funny to watch the guys go crazy over asking girls out too.  Glad I'm not a teen anymore.
Yeah, and lets not forget the maze at the end.
Who would have expected that lead to a port key?
I know right?  And to the worst possible place.
I know, I felt bad for Cedric.  But that fight with Voldemort was pretty cool.
I know right?  It was one of the best parts.
Especially when Peter cut off his own hand.
