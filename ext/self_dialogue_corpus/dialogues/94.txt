I'm hoping the superhero movie genre does not get stale.
I don't think it will, look what they are doing with The Avengers. Making single movies about individuals superheros and then putting it all together.
Yea, but how long can that last?
I don't know, but they is a lot of stories to tell
I see what you mean. I did really like Logan.
Logan was amazing, it was sad to see the ending though.
Hopefully, its not the end of that series
I'm sure X-Men will come back with other timelimes or something
I hope so, I enjoyed it from the beginning.
Yea, especially wolverines storyline.
