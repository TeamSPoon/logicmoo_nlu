What is your favorite Bruno Mars song?
I really like Uptown Funk.
Oh I agree. I don't think there's anyway to listen to that song and not become happy.
Yeah, it's so infectious.
What do you think about his new hit?
That's What I Like? I'm not loving it.
Me either. The beat is not as catchy.
Oh I dislike the lyrics.
I can see that. Almost makes me start to think of Blurred Lines.
Yeah, they're not quite at that level, but the lack of the actual woman's voice in the song really takes away women's agency  inadvertently.
