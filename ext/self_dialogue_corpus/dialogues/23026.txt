What is your favorite Star Wars movie?
I really like Return of the Jedi.
That's a really great one.
Have you seen Rogue One yet?
No, I'll get it when it's out on dvd.
It's already out on dvd.
That was fast. Didn't the movie just come out a few months ago?
I think it came out around Christmas.
Is Rogue One any good?
It's really good.
Do you know who John Williams is?
Yeah he's the guy who does the Star Wars music.
Rogue One was the first Star Wars movie John Williams didn't do the soundtracks for.
Really, I didn't know that.
Yeah, a bunch of nerds online had a fit over it.
You can't tell watch the movie.  It sounds like a Star Wars movie.
Wasn't Jimmy Smits in Rogue One?
Yeah, he plays Princess Leia's dad.
So overall you think I should see Rogue One?
Yeah, I highly recommend it.
