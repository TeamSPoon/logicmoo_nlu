Have you ever watched The Purge?
Yea of course! That movie is crazy.
Yea, could you imagine something like that?
Not really, I don't even think the movie makes any sense.
Yea but it's still a cool thriller.
Yea, just because it's so creative.
Definitely, there was no other movie like that.
No, the purge is one of a kind.
If there were a real purge, I don't even know what I would do.
I would hide underground.
