Are you going to see the new star wars movie?
Probably not.
Why not?
I haven't seen the last one, so I would be lost.
Well go see the last one then, they are cool.
I don't like the new characters.
You would like them if you saw the movie, Luke Skywalker has a daughter.
Oh really? I didn't know that.
Yea the new girl is his daughter, and Luke will probably start to play a really big role.
Oh, that is pretty cool. I'll go watch it then.
