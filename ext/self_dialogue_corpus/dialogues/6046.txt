One Disney film with a good true-to-life character is Pocahantas.
I totally agree.  She is a good role model.
I'm glad Disney made this movie.  It shows a solid female character.
Yeah, like Mulan.
Right.  They moved past the heroine in distress.
I like how Pocahantas was so tied into nature.
Yes it was great how she educated John Smith in that area.
Especially in that era.
The "Colors of the Wind" song played all over at the time.
I thought it was so pretty.
