What do you think a modern Ariel would feel about humans? Compared to how they were before?
I don't know, I think mermaids would find humans in general to be gross.
She loved their culture and creations that they didn't have underwater.
But would she love everything else now?
Haha, her riding in a carriage was a riot, imagine her in a car.
Or a plane!
Her mind was blown when she found a telescope, imagine how she'd react to computer.
We see in the sequel she loves her life as a human though.
That's true.
Modern Ariel would be a riot.
