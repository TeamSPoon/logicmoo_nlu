Have you heard RadioHeads earlier stuff?
No I have not.
I used to love their music.
Do you still like them.
Yes I do.
Do you like their newer stuff.
Yes but not as much as their older stuff.
Wow I will have to check them out.
Do you ever listen to them?
Only what I hear on the radio or streaming.
Their older stuff from over 10 years ago is best.
Ok I will have to give it a listen then.
Kid A and Amnesiac are their best albums in my opinion.
Ok thank you for telling me.
Yes they are so great, so harmonious, inspiring, and even energetic.
Wow what kind of sound do those albums have.
Great soft lyrics with unique and great sounding instrumentals.
Wow that is interesting.
They are so unique and interesting.
Ok thank you for telling me about them.
