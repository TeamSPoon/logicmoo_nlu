Did you see the news about the Han Solo movie?
There's a Han Solo movie?
I... well, uh. Not yet.
Oh Lord. Disney is really milking this, huh.
I dunno, maybe. But it looks like it's... in trouble, anyway.
Oh no. A spin-off movie nobody asked for is in trouble.
I mean. It... could be kind of cool. We don't know anything about his early life.
Isn't that kind of the point of him? Why do we need to know any of that?
Because... he's Han Solo. I mean, he's the best one.
I'm assuming Harrison Ford isn't in this, right?
