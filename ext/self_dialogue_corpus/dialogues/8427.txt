Were you ever a fan of Madonna?
I actually liked her music back in high school and had one of her CDs.
Which was your favorite song of hers?
"Material Girl" was one of my faves.
Oh yes I remember that one.
I listened to her music periodically.
Remember when ACE of Base was popular?
I'm not sure I remember them, name one of their songs.
One was "The Sign", I loved that one.
I think I remember it being sung on Full House!
