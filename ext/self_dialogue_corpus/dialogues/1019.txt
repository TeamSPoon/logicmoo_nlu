this season should be awesome!
yeah, i think this is the bears year
no way, I think dallas has this.
maybe, but last year proved they were not ready
well, the injuries were a factor, hopefully that wont be the case this year
hopefully, it was a mess last season
but the bears? I do not think they have a chance
the coach has learned a lot, so i think they'll be ok
yea, but to contend with these other teams?
I know, but you have to have faith
honestly, it will probably be the patriots again...
haha, yeah, maybe. Brady is unstoppable.
sure seems that way, that guy is a monster!
Its unreal how they win so easily
well, the whole patriots team is stellar
definitely, an all star line up
I think they definitely have at least one more in them
yeah, I can see that, with how they have been dominating the last decade
think the raiders and chargers might give them a run for their money
The seahawks may have a chance also
