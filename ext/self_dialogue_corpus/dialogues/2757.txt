I'm really getting excited for the Bills season
Oh you're crazy, no way do they do anything relevant
Im not sure with a new front office they could have a chance this year
It's not possible it's not like they got any better on the field.
They got healthier, another season with Tyrod Taylor and a new coach could open up the game the way it should be.
Nope not a chance, You honestly think they can contend in their division?
Well I certainly think they are better than the Jets.
Ok, who isnt better than the jets? But really Patriots, Dolphins?
The fins are terrible they haven't done anything relevant in years.
Ok, so the patriots?
Well you're not going to really compete with them, you just need to beat them once at least.
And you think that can happen? They got even better
Sure, but any given sunday right?
What does that even mean? The patriots are so steady and never miss a step
well true but its not like they are unstoppable. Maybe if brady gets hurt or something
Haha, Maybe but Garrappolo is certainly capable
True he did manage to get them through a few situations in the past.
Yeah and hes going to be the next Brady, just watch
That would be the most patriots thing to happen
Yep exactly they never miss a beat, its just next man up with those guys
