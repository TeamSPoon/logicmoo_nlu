Hey Jim, why so glum?
You can tell I'm depressed?
Yeah. It's pretty obvious.
How do you mean?
You look horrible. You haven't showered of shaved all week.
I haven't felt like it.
Your living room is a mess.
Really? I hadn't noticed.
You still have two have-eaten pizzas on the table
I haven't felt like finishing them.
You are still wearing the same closes you had on last Sunday!
It's my football outfit.
Yeah, I could tell by the helmet you are wearing.
It protects me from concussions.
Concussion?  Dude, you have to move from your recliner to get a concussion.
I suppose so.
And there is one more thing that I noiced.
What's that?
You still are wearing the body paint you were wearing while we watched the Superbowl together last Sunday. You are painted completely blue, except for the enormous horse shoe painted on your chest.
The Colts were so close to winning it all, and then the season ended. The thought of having to wait months until the next season starts is just too depressing!
