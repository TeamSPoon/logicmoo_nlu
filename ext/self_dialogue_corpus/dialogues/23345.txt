We just rewatched the movie Fargo last night. Did you ever see it?
Is that an old one?
Yes it was out in 1996.
I think I mught have. Who is in it?
William H. Macy is the lead character.
He's the guy in Shameless right?
Yea, the father.
Yes I did see it, it was a good movie.
Yea, funny but a lot of killing too.
Steve Buscemi was a great character in that movie. I like him.
Yes he was great. A funny man to look at but a great actor.
I love the way they have the actors do that Minnesota accent.
Yea, and they talk real slow.
I think that was named one of the best one hundred movies of all time.
Really, I didn't know that.
If I remember correctly, yeah.
Well it should have if it wasn't.
Definitely.
They have a T.V. show now based on the movie.
Really, I'll have to check it out.
