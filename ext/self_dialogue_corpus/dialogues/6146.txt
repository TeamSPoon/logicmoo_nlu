Did you like Aladdin?
The Disney movie?  Yeah, I liked it.
What was your favorite part?
I loved the Genie.  Robin Williams was hillarious.
Wasn't there an animated series for Aladdin?
I don't know.  There might have been.
I think I remember watching it after school.
I know there was one for Hercules.
I do remember that one.
It would be right up Disney's alley to have turned Hercules into an animated series.
