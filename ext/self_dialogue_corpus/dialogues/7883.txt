Hey friend! Do you think the Harry Potter movies are as good as the books?
At times, sure. My favorite movie was the fourth one, because of the Tri-Wizard Tournament and the visiting wizarding schools.
I enjoyed that one, too! If you could go to one of the schools, which would you pick?
I'd probably choose Durmstrang. It seems a little darker than the others, a little like wizarding school in Russia.
Plus the name is a smart pun on the "sturm und drang" music and literary aesthetic. Which school uniforms were your favorite in the films?
I enjoyed the Beauxbatons blue uniforms, but it's hard to go wrong with the classic Hogwarts robes with house crests.
What did you think about the last book being split into two movies?
I partly thought it was a little opportunistic, but for me the last movies were the most emotionally intense because I never finished the book so all the action was actually a surprise.
Wow, you really never finished the book? So what was the most emotional part of the final films?
I think it had already been spoiled, but Dobby's death was definitely the toughest part.
