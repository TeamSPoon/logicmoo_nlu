Ugh, I'm so tired of the Patriots winning everything.
Tom Brady forever, baby.
Ok, but he's getting old. This can't possibly continue.
He eats like nothing but nuts and seeds. He's going to live forever.
I don't think he's going to die. I think he's just getting too old for football.
Age is nothing but a number!
Besides, there are other contenders.
Yeah, like who?
Uh, the Packers?
Come on...
The Seahawks?
Are you serious right now?
Ok, maybe the Pats will win again. But this can't go on forever.
Who says?
I bet if the Pats win 3 Super Bowls in a row someone will kneecap Brady.
I'm surprised nobody has yet.
It's because everyone's scared of Belichick.
Wow, maybe Belichick will retire.
No way. He's gonna coach from his deathbed.
He's not a quitter, that's for sure.
