Are you a hockey fan?
No, I used to be when I was a kid.
What was your favorite team?
The New York Rangers. Back when they had Mark Messaih, and Brian Leech.
Cool! What got you into hockey?
Don't laugh... The Mighty Ducks D2 movie.
That's pretty funny!
Yeah, I used to play street hockey a lot because of that movie.
In New York? I didn't know anybody that played street hockey.
I lived in a big neighborhood and all the kids played.
Seriously?
Yeah, literally every kid had a pair of roller blades and hockey sticks.
You must have been pretty good then if you got to play all the time.
Yeah, definitely better than average.
What position did you play?
Center.
Then you definitely must have been good.
Yeah all the kids were.
You're pretty lucky to have grown up in that neighborhood.
It was a fun time for sure.
