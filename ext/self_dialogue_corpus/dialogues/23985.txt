What is the best movie you've ever seen?
Oh man that's a tough choice
So many options, I know!
I'd have to say The Prestige
What is that movie about? Sounds familiar
It's about a magician who creates a trick that nobody else can copy
What's the trick
He duplicates himself... or so he wants you to think!
How can he possibly fake that! It must be magic!
You need to see the movie to see how he does it... or how he fakes it!
Wow, I am very interested in seeing it now!
Do you have any favorite movies?
I like Lucky Number Slevin
I've heard that movie name before, but what is it about?
A guy named Slevin is mistaken for a mobster and lands in some deep crap!
Who wants to kill him? Just other mobsters?
yeah there's a guy named The Rabbi
He's the only one hunting down Slevin?
No there's another guy named The Boss
Those names sound really weird, I dont think I'll watch it
