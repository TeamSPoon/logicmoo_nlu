Do you enjoy the song Desperado?
By the eagles?
Yes that is the one.
I like it. But very slow.
That is part of what makes it so great.
Maybe. I prefer eagles Life in the fast lane.
That is a good track, Very different though.
Ya desperado is more of a love song.
Exactly slow and sweet. Fast lane is like  a party anthem.
A great one!
Agreed! I also really like Take it to the limit.
You really seem to enjoy the slower love songs of theirs.
I never really thought about it, but that may be very true.
It is a very romantic song. I do enjoy it as well.
The eagles just haves many great tracks overall.
Ya. They are pretty legendary.
I was so happy when they reunited for the album Hell Freezes Over,
That was 1994 right?
Correct they had broken up in 1980 or 1981 .
I think it was 1980. Sure glad they got back together for that album too!
