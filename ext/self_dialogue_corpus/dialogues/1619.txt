It's almost football season!
Yes indeed. You ready to see my Lions finally take home the crown?
The Lions!? I believe the Browns before that!
The Browns!? Now you're just purposefully trying to offend me.
Okay, okay. Maybe that's a bit far, but the Lions have a way to go.
I think we got it this year, man. Stafford is maturing every year.
That's true, and he's talented, but the supporting case is terrible!
All we need is a good offense and decent defense, and I think we have that.
No, no. You need an extraordinary defense!
Not for every team. You just need to put up more points than the opponent.
Tell that to the Falcons!
Ouch! That's too soon considering the Falcons are my number two team!
I didn't know that. They should be good this year.
I agree, but I think the Bucs are on the come up.
Yes indeed. I love some Winston.
Yeah, he's gonna be good one day.
He reminds me of Cam, for sure. Has a ton of potential.
I'm not sure about that. He reminds me more of a QB like Big Ben.
That's true. He's not as fast as Cam.
And certainly not as big as Cam!
