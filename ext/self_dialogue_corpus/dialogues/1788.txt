Who you think will be this years MVP?
Tough to say since there are so many great players
You have to your eye on someone who you think has a chance.
I guess I would go with Leveon Bell.
Bell? Really!
Yeah I think as long as he stays out of trouble than he can get the stats needed for the MVP.
I guess I can see that. Staying out of trouble is going to be key for him.
Yeah, he was great again last year despite being suspended.
Plus they get Martavius Bryant back from suspension which should help out the passing game.
Getting him back should help get safetys out of the box on run support.
Steelers are looking like they could make another superbowl push with all the pieces they have.
I agree, only thing is people are not sure how long Roethlisberger will be around.
I forgot he was thinking about retiring this past season.
Yeah he was, its unfortunate because he is a great QB despite his age
He always is playing hurt from what I can remember.
That is no lie. He is a tough guy though.
No doubt. One of the toughest QBs to ever play the game.
Yep, but Bell is my pick for MVP.
Bell has a solid chance, but will have some stiff competition.
Your right, there are many good running backs out there.
