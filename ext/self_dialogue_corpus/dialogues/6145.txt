What is your favorite Disney movie?
My favorite Disney movie is 101 dalmatians, the original one.
Who is your favorite character in that movie?
Oddly enough it was Kuala Deville who is yours?
It's so funny she's evil witch.   I thought she was very very scary.  My favorite character was that little dog name patch.
All the Little  dogs were so cute in that movie they did such a good job on that movie.
What's your favorite scene in the movie.
My Favorite scene in the movie was when they were walking up the creek so they didn't leave footprints.   What is your favorite scene.
I really just like when they showed all the dogs on top of the hill at the end.
Oh yes I agree the ending was absolutely perfect!
