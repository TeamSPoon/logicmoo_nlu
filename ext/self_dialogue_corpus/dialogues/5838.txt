What was your favorite Disney cartoon growing up?
I really liked their animated version of Robin Hood.
I don't think I had seen that one.
It's older.  I think it was from the seventies.
Did it follow the Robin Hood story line?
Pretty much, except the characters were animals.  Robin Hood was a fox.
Was it good?
Oh, we had it on VHS and we watched it like every week.
So it really was one of your favorites.
Yeah, I'm surprised you'd never seen it.
