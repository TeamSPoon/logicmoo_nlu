Have you seen any good movies lately?
Yeah, I saw The Wave.
What was that about?
It was a foreign film about a huge wave that happened.
Oh, that's cool. Tell me more.
It was in Norwegian, and the wave happened because of an avalanche.
That's interesting. Was the movie any good?
Yeah it was really good actually.
How did you watch it in another language?
I put subtitles on of course.
Did the movie win any awards?
No, but it was nominated for an academy award I think.
It sounds pretty good. Where can I go to watch it?
I saw it on Netflix, but I'm sure you could rent it online somewhere too.
I'll definitely give it a watch.
I would definitely watch it just for the scenery. That part of Norway is just absolutely gorgeous.
There's a lot of scenery in it?
Yeah, the whole setting is by a lake in the steep mountains. Very, very beautiful.
Wow, that's awesome!
Yeah it was so cool to look at. The directing was very good too, no cheesy moments like most disaster movies.
