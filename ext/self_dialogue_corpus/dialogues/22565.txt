Guess what they made a movie about Tupac again
Yeah I heard about that they actually named it after one of his songs
Oh really I didn't know the title was after he one of his songs
Wow how you didn't know that all eyes on me is one of his songs
So was the movie any good did actually predict how he died
What you talking about Tupac Not Dead
Yeah  Tupac is dead
I'm just playing with you but yeah they did a pretty good job the storyline
What type of movie is it is it like a documentary
No they made it more into like a regular movie instead of a documentary
Oh that's cool I mean is it fiction or facts
Mostly fiction because we really don't know what happened
So why watch it then
To see what the general public has to think about Tupac in his death
We already know what everybody thinks about Tupac in his stuff
Plus they got some pretty good old scenes in there like you might want to check out
Yeah I like the old stuff I don't really like the new things would be making up most of it
You have you noticed that it seem like rap now all they do is play beats No Good lyrics
That's what you call club songs
I know it's just nowadays music has no meaning
