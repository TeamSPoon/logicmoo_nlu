What did you think of Fantasia?
I hate that movie.  It's just a bunch of werid cartoons with music.
Really? I love it!
Uh, that thing is so boring!
I love all the little cartoons! The Sorceror's Apprentice is classic.
Mickey never talks! It's boring.
What about Night on Bald Mountain?
Scary as heck!
I disagree.  I love it.
Glad somebody does.
