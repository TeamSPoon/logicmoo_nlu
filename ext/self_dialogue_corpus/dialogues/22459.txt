I just heard there is a new Pirates of the Caribbean movie coming out.
No way! I love those movies.
I do too.
Those movies never get old to me.
They will probably be making more of them for a long time.
There are so many story lines they can do.
Maybe as long as Johnny Depp is alive.
True, they could never replace Jack Sparrow.
No there is no way. It would not be the same.
Is Kiera Knightly in this one?
No, I don't think so.
How about Orlando Bloom?
Yes! He is in it.
Well then you can't lose with Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom.
I know just what you mean.
Those movies do get a bit scary though.
Yes, they can be dark, but a good dark.
I like that kind of genre anyways.
A little fantasy and action put together.
They do real well with those movies. They keep you on the edge of your seat.
