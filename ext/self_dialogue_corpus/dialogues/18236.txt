What type of music do you like?
I prefer country
Country?  Why?
It just sounds good
Anything more specific..?
I guess it just describes my life best
Oh, yea I guess many people like music for those reasons
Yea and the instruments are better
To each their own
Very true!
I like rock
Rock and country are very similar now
I agree
They share many of the same elements
Yea it seems like some songs could go either way
Right, like the accent just separates them
I know what you mean
And some artists do both genres
True that
Same page!
