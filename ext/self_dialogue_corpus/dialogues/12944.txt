What do you think of Boba Fett?
Honestly I think he's overrated.
Come on! He's an amazing character.
But he barely even speaks!
Maybe I'm a sucker for the strong, silent type. You have to admit his armor was cool though.
I will give you that. What did you think of his backstory from Attack of the Clones?
It was okay, I guess. Not what I was expecting, for sure.
It would have been fun to see Boba in Revenge of the Sith, to give more backstory and develop the character.
True, but that movie was already full. Where would they have put him in?
You're right; I'm not sure.
