My favorite movie genre is comedy. What is yours?
Me too! I love the movie Dumb & Dumber and The Mask.
Jim Carey was super funny in Dumb & Dumber. Remember when he got his tongue frozen onto the ski chair?
Yes and then they were trying to pull his tongue off of it. That was so silly.
Yes! Remember the toilet scene when Harry got the runs and then it wasn't working?
Oh that was so disgustingly funny.
Do you remember when Lloyd and Harry were riding the scooter and they did a close up of Lloyd face with all the boogers on his face?
Oh my gosh yes. They were riding into Aspen, right?
Yes they were driving into Aspen.
They were such a mess. I loved them together in that movie.
