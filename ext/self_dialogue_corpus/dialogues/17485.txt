Ugh, this thing never ends.
You want music, this is it.
No, Music is for listening, not analyzing.
Well, music is for both, actually. Music is logic, and it is as beautiful as any mathematical proof you'll ever see
Stop with math stuff. Go back to music. That hemi, non hemi stuff
Hemitonic. Well, the Hemitonic scale is a pentatonic scale that contains one or more semitones.
A semitone is a half step note?
Yes. So is the c major pentatpnic a hemitponic scale?
Um.. How do I find out?
Look for semitone step in the note.
Oh. um... Ok. so it's C, D, E, G, A, right?
yes. are any notes separated by a semitone?
Um... no. but is three half steps considered a semi tone?
3 is not equal to 1. so no.
So c major pentatoni scale is not a hemitonic scale?
NO it's not a hemitonic scale, it is an anhemitonic scale. Also known and ditonic scale.
Um what's ditonic mean?
Di, 2. tonic, related to a tone. Two tone scales. Or the notes combine the two neighboring notes. since all whole notes are 2 half steps away, what notes are ditonis in the c major pentatonic scale?
Wait,. start over. What?
You asked if 3 half steps count as half steps, yes?
