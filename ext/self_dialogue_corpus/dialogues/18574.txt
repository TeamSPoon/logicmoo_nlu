I'm always looking for new music.
Any particular genres?
Electronic these days. I know rock pretty well, but am always curious about EDM.
How about techno?
Yeah! I like the overall sound. Did that start out a German thing?
Not technically, actually. It originated in the Detroit area.
What?! It seems like all that stuff owes something to Kraftwerk.
Oh, it does, but the guys that started it were into them. That's why.
Detroit? Wow, I'd never have guessed. Whereabouts?
These were mostly guys in the black suburbs of the city. Ones that could afford synthesizers.
I see., but how did they end up with this sound?
They were into some electro-funk, too, like Parliament Funkadelic's more electronic stuff.
That explains something. It is a bit bassier than some of Kraftwerk's stuff.
Yeah. That "colder" sound reflected the factory automation, which they were protesting.
Over people losing jobs to machines?
Yeah. It really did have a dystopian sci-fi element to it in the early days when this all came out.
That's one of the bigger shocks I've had learning about music. Crazy.
I was surprised myself. I associate Detroit with all kinds of important music, but wasn't expecting Techno.
Well, I guess that's what keeps stuff interesting--all the surprises here and there.
Can't argue with that.
