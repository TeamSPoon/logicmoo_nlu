What was your favorite movie growing up as a child?
I have plenty of them but i would have to say Starwars.
Which Starwars movie are you talking about? The New Hope?
New Hope was great but i'm a have to go with Return of the Jedi.
Yeah, that was one of my favorite as well.
George Lucas puts together some awesome movies.
Did you get to see the newest Starwars movie The Force Awakens?
Yeah, i thought it was pretty good but hated that Han Solo died.
I know his death scene sucked big time. Hopefully they decide to make a Han Solo origin movie.
That would be great to see on the big screen for sure.
Did you get around to seeing Rogue One?
Yes i did, i actually enjoyed it a bit more than the Force Awakens.
I love how the new Starwars movies have strong female leads.
Yeah Rey is definitely one of my new favorite characters.
Do you think she is related to Luke Skywalker?
I don't know, maybe Ben Kenobi?
Well that would be an epic twist in the story line.
I wouldn't mind watch a spin off Ben Kenobi movie as well.
Yeah, they can explain what he was doing living in the desert for all those years.
The Starwars saga has many more chapters ahead.
