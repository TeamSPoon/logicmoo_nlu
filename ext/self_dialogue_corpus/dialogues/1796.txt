Hey, what do you think about football?
Oh I love it!
Wait you mean the NFL right?
Naw man!
Oh you like soccer...
Yea!
Well I meant the NFL
No I'm all for European Football
Well do you ever watch the NFL?
It looks too boring!
It is definitely not boring!
Well it could be more intense!
How do you say that?
It just seems too much planning
Oh so the pacing?
Yea it seems slow!
It's really intense though when they are on the clock!
Yea I can agree to an extent
You should give it another try
I may!
