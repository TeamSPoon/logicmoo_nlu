Just saw fight club, he was the guy the whole time!
Fight club kept me guessing.
It was like a thriller and a psychological thriller all at once.
It was a big film, but we are not supposed to talk about it.
What? Oh, the line in the film "Don't talk about fight club".
He was Tyler Durdan the whole time!
Yep. If you re-watch it, you will see no one speaks to both of them at the same time.
I had not even noticed.
I like the way it slowly let you in on him being Tyle.
Like when he goes looking for him, and the bar tender winks at him.
