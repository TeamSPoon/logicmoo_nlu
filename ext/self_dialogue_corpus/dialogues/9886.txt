What happened to DMX?
I think he got into drugs
I mean his career fell off
Yeah Whats my Name was a great single though
Oh definitely and he had a raspy voice you needed for that track.
He tried acting
I think he tried a bunch of stuff.
But yeah whats my name embodied rap at the time.
Yeah I agree it was crucial to the point that it defined a decade.
That was really the last of violent rap that we have heard
