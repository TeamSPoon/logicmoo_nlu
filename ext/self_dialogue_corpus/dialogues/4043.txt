I have a fifteen year old granddaughter who won't watch Jurassic Park.
I kind of get that.
I know,it's scary.
It is a classic.
Yet another Steven Spielberg hit.
He's got a lot of them.
The movie won an Academy Award for special effects.
Well that makes sense.
Love Jeff Goldblum.
He was great in it.
