Have you seen Wonder Woman yet?
Yeah dude, it was great.
Gal Gadot was amazing, and so gorgeous I did't know what to do.
She is a great Wonder Woman.
Yeah, too bad Trevor died at the end.
Yeah, but she does't age so I guess she would lose him anyway.
That's true.  Also the guy that played Ares was really good.
I thought so too.  With today's special effects they can make older actors who are really good do younger actor things.
The best part by far was when she went out into no man's land.
I though so too, it just showed this epic fearlessness.
Yeah, and when she was pinned down everyone came to help her.
Yeah, it was also amazing to have her see the devastation of WWI.
I loved the WWI setting.
Yeah, it gave the movie uniqueness.
Yeah by far the best DC movie.
I agree and it's not even close.  It was an awesome movie.
It had plenty of comedy mixed in with the action.
Like their little group there.  That slimy guy was funny.
Yeah, and the part on the boat.
That was awesome.
