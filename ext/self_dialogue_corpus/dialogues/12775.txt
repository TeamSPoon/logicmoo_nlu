Did you like Return of the Jedi?
Yeah I liked it a lot. It was probably the weakest of the original trilogy but it was still good and a classic Star Wars movie.
Why do you say it's the weakest? What's wrong with it.
Well that's just in comparison to the other two. There's a lot of great thing about it but the weaker parts are probably the Ewoks and the retread of having another Death Star.
You didn't like the Ewoks? I thought they were really cute.
That's the problem, they're there just to have some cuddly cute creatures and sell toys and not to add anything to the plot. At least that's my opinion.
The battle scene near the end of Return of the Jedi was pretty great though, right?
Yeah that and the final lightsabre duel between Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader is amazing. That's why I will never say it's a bad movie.
Did you think that the final battle went on for too long? Some people say that it did.
I don't think so. At the time it was the end of the Star Wars  series so there should have been this massive epic fight to end a hugely popular series of movies.
