Did you see that Queen is going out on tour?
That's so strange given that half the band isn't with them.
Yeah, but at least you get to hear them playing the classics.
True, and Adam Lambert's voice works well with rock.
I'm hoping to get tickets.
Do you have a favorite Queen LP?
Queen II, definitely. It's their mangum opus in my opinion.
I'm more into the radio singles and stuff.
Those are also good, but they used to be so much more intense.
It was the 1970s. Everybody was intense.
