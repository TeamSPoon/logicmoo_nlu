So, what are you thinking for your fantasy football draft strategy this year?
I would say the top three picks are D. Johnson, L.Bell, or E.Elliott.
I agree with you, I would pick David Johnson first.
David Johnson will get 1,000 yards rushing and 1,000 yards receiving this year.
You throw in 20 touchdowns he is the clear number on e pick.
After the three running backs, I'm thinking Antoinio Brown, Julio, and OBJ will be picked.
I think I would pick OBJ over Julio this year.
Reallly?
Yeah, Julio isn't consistent at scoring touchdowns, he rarely gets over 10 in a year.
Yeah but the yards and catches are awesome.
I think OBJ gets almost as many yards and will outscore Julio by 8 touchdowns.
Yeah, but Eli manning is throwing to him.
The addition of Brandon Marshall will take coverage away from him and open up the field.
True, Brandon Marshall is a huge upgrade over Victor Cruz.
Where do you rank Melvin Gordon?
I rank him at 7.
I agree with you on that. He's a full time running back on a decent offense.
I really like Gordon, he catches and is their goal line back, he's primed for a huge year..
I also like L.McCoy.
I agree McCoy should have a great year.
