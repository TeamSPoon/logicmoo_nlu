I heard Miley Cyrus is going to be on The Voice this fall- I think she's a great coach.
I know, if you're going to have someone advising you, you would want someone sweet and supportive like her.
The judges are Blake and Adam again, Miley, and Jennifer Hudson. Blake always wants all the country acts, so I hope Miley takes on pop singers and helps them stand out.
Well, if there's one thing Miley knows how to do, it's stand out.
I doubt she'd do anything like have them appear naked on a wrecking ball, but I hope she would have them be more adventurous with their costumes.
I know what you mean, sometimes singers all seem so alike, it's hard to remember them.
Miley is really versatile, she's a great country singer, but also a pop music superstar. Maybe she could help her people learn to be more versatile in their music choices.
I'm sure she would have some great suggestions on songs. She knows what appeals to people.
I'm going to miss Gwen Stefani though, her and Blake were cute together.
Some people thought TOO cute.
