What did you do this weekend?
Nothing much really. Listened to some music and watched a movie.
Cool. What did you see?
I watched Jaws.
Had you ever seen it before?
No actually, I missed it when I was a kid.
What did you think?
It was scary!
No it is not. That movie looks so fake.
You're crazy. The shark looks so real.
Are you scared to go in the water now?
Nope. I'll be brave.
What music did you listen to this weekend?
The new Bruno Mars album.
How is it? Should I check it out?
It's great. Lots of fun, but very poppy.
He's a big pop star. I expected that from it.
I totally suggest checking it out though.
I will. His last single was a great song.
I agree. It did so well on the charts too!
