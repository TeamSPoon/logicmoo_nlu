Who do you think is prettier, Padme or Leia?
I'd say Padme was prettier, but Leia had a better personality.
Leia definitely had some energy to her. She was the coolest.
It kind of weirds me out when I think about her kiss with Luke.
That was no big deal. She was just trying to get Han's attention.
He definitely got jealous.
Yeah, and Luke just gloated. That was funny.
I'm glad that Han and Leia got together.
Me too, but Ben didn't turn out too cool.
He must have had a dark side nanny or babysitter when he was a kid, or maybe just too much of his grandfather in him.
