I have never seen a truly scary movie.
Never?
Not one.
Why?
Well, I try to watch them, but I always fall asleep before they get interesting.
What are you, sleep narcoleptic?
No. I just get bored during the beginning of the movies, before the storyline gets thrilling.
Then you need to watch "The Dark Knight Rises"
The Dark Knight Rises?
That's right! You won't fall asleep during that one...I guarrentee!
