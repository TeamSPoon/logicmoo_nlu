Lady gaga is a little too out there for me with her out fits.
She is a statement maker for sure.
I mean seriously a dress made out of meat! Gross and yucky!
She knew what to do to get people to notice her.
Well notice her we did.
I have never really listened to her albums
Yeah I only hear her latest pop song on the radio.If I listen to the radio
Music is getting so boring that people like Lady Gaga have to do something to get noticed
Well cheers to you Lady Gaga. I hope it keeps working for you
Count me out...
