So what are you expecting for the upcoming NFL season?
I expect business as usual, Patriots, Seahawks, Falcons, Cowboys dominating the season.
No surprise teams coming out?
Well the Raiders might end up doing good.
I personally think that the Titans are going to be a force this season.
Yes, Marcus Mariota is a very exciting player.
I just wish my Texans are able to take a step forward.
There defense is very good, I think they will do pretty great in the upcoming season.
I hope you are right.
Yeah, they will be a solid playoff team and a dark horse to get to the Super Bowl.
That would be great if that happened.
Are you going to attend any Texans games this season?
I don't think so, I am so busy with work, are you going to go to any games this season.
Yes, I will head to a Cardinals game when I visit home around Thanksgiving.
Wow that sounds fun, the Cardinals can do good this season.
Yeah, but I don't think they can unseat the Seahawks in the division.
You never know, anything can happen.
I suppose, but we will need a lot to go right for that to happen.
Well let's just wait and see, not too long until the season begins.
Yup! Looking forward to it.
