So I've never seen the Harry Potter movies.
Really? By 2017 you haven't seen ANY of the movies?
No. I've read the books so many times I'm worried it will ruin it.
Only if you go into the movies expecting the same thing as the books, word for word, scene for scene.
Does that not happen?
Well, in the first book they almost match it up scene for scene, but they cut out some of the stuff at the end when they are trying to get to the stone.
Really? That sucks. I love that part of the book.
Yeah, but there is SO much they get right. And some much that the books don't have.
Really? Like what.
The music. Right off the bat, it adds so much to it. Plus the detail that they put into all of the shots. My visit of Hogwarts couldn't compare to the movie version.
