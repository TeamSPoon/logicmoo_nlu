You know whatelse is weird?
Oh God, now what?
Why does Kylo Ren have to wear a mask too?
Because he's a gradnson of Darth Vader! And Darth Vader wears a mask
But we just said, Darth Vader's mask is wrong.
I didn't say it's wrong. You said the reason for the mask is weird. And it's for the drama of the experience. it'd be weird if he didn't have a mask
Why, because he's a grandson of Darth Vader who wore the unneeded mask?
The mask is needed. The mask is necessary. It defines Darth Vader!
Well, it's the wrong and stupid definition, if you ask me. And the same goes for Klyo. He doesn't need the mask. He's just wearign it for no reason.
The reason is that he's the grandson of Darth Vader! That's why he has to wear a mask! it defines them both!.
