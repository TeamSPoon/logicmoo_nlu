Paul McCartney turned 75 a few days ago. Can you believe that?
Wow. He still seems pretty healthy and active for his age.
Yes, and he's still a very talented performer.
Is he the last surviving Beatle?
No, Ringo Starr is also still alive.
That's right, I almost forgot about him.
I wish that John Lennon and George Harrison were also still alive.
How long ago did each of them die?
George Harrison died of cancer in 2001 and John Lennon was killed in 1980.
Wow. What terrible losses.
