Did you go see that new movie with king Arthur?
You mean King Arthur?
Yes, that one, did you see it?
Yes, I did. You have not?
No, was it any good?
It was full of action. I liked it, are you going to see it ?
Maybe, it looks a lot like Tristan and Isolde to me.
It is actually a similar story structure. But it is worth seeing, reminds me more of the old film Camelot.
I loved that show! Same feel as Robin Hood, with Kevin Costner.
Ugh, with his accent. No, the best Robin Hood, was Robin Hood Men in Tights, ever seen it?
Yes! classic, funny, gold. A lot like The Princess Brid.
The best movie ever made. Based on a book, like Breakfast at Tiffany's believe it or not.
I did not know that, is Breakfast at Tiffany's as good as people say?
Yes, I mean it is no Roman Holiday, but it is cute and funny and warming.
I love all her work, did you ever see her in My Fair Lady?
Yes, liked that show a lot. Her name reminds me of Dr. Doolittle.
I liked those shows. Did you see the newer Dr.Doolittles?
With Eddie Murphy? of course, they were funny, reminded me of Flubber.
Flubber, classic lost to the times. Ever see Jumanji?
Scared me, so I did not finish it.
