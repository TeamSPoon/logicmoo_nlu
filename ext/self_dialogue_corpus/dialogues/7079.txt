What's your favorite Disney movie from the last couple of years?
I like a lot of them. Maybe, I would go with The Finest Hours.
That was a Disney movie?
Yes, it was. It wasn't animated, but it was Disney all the same.
Why did you like it?
I liked it because it showed a man who cared about rescuing these other men that were stuck out on a sinking ship in the middle of a storm.
Does it have a happy ending?
Yes it actually does. It's based on a true story also.
I do like to see movies that are based on a true story.
Yeah, it makes it seem more real because you know this sort of thing really happened and isn't just totally made up for dramatics.
