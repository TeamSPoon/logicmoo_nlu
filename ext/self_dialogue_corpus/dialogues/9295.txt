What's this huge stack of CDs?
Well remember I was going to loan you some Class A'z?
This is all Class A'z?
About half of it is.
What's the rest?
Well Class A'z has consisted of several different artists who've also done other stuff, so some of it is that group as a whole and some of it is the individual artists' solo ventures.
Oh cool! This looks like it will take a long time to get through
Don't feel obligated to continue listening to an album if you're not digging it, but I'm sure you'll find some good stuff in there.
Thanks, I really wanted to expand my musical horizons.
No problem!
