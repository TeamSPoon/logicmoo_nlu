Have you seen A Field of Dreams?
Directed by Phil Robinson?
Yes, directed by Phil Alden Robinson. The VHS came out in 1999.
I believe so. What's it about?
The film is about a guy who turns his cornfield into a baseball diamond and plays ball there.
Is that from where the quote "If you build it, he will come" is from?
Yes! That is a famous quote from the movie.
Is that about Warren Moon too?
I'm not sure, that might be another baseball movie.
I saw Bad Season Bears a while ago. It was OK.
I think Charlie Sheen was in that movie.
I believe he was too. It was an OK movie.
A Field of Dreams ran one hour and forty-six minutes.
Is that so? Is that long?
I don't believe so, no.
Why not?
I've seen a lot of movies end earlier in theaters.
I haven't been to a theater in a while. The last movie I saw was Avatar.
That sold very well.
Yes, I have heard that as well. It cost a lot to make.
