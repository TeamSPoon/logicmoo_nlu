Luke Skywalker is the worst character in Star Wars by far.
He's the grand master. How can you say that?
He's whiney and he runs and he's responsible for BILLIONS of deaths.
Elaborate.
Easy. He cried that one of his students turned and ran away to a planet to be by himself. Meanwhile, that student killed an entire star system.
Luke just sat there.
Yeah, kind of pathetic, right?
What do you think he's doing on that planet?
Probably waiting for the pity party to arrive.
Haha!
