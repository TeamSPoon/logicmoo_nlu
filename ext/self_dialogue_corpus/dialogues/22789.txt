What's your favorite movie with comedians from Saturday Night Live.
Hm, I think that would have to be Billy Madison.
Really? That was such a silly movie.
What do you expect? It's Adam Sandler, Chris Farley and Norm McDonald.
True. I was a huge Wayne's World fan.
Schwing! Both the Wayne's World movies were good.
Yeah Mike Myers was really good in the Austin Powers movies too. He's actually pretty talented.
What else has he been in?
Nothing recently. He was in So I Married an Ax Murderer back in the day, and then I think in the Love Guru.
Yeah I havent seen him around. Kristin Wiig seems to be everywhere these days.
Bridesmaids was so good! Melissa McCarthy killed it in those.
Yeah she totally stole the show. But Kristin Wiig's been in other movies, like the Martian, which was kind of weird.
Oh, she was? I didnt see that one.
It was pretty good, Matt Damon turned out to be quite a good Martian gardener.
Whenever I think of Matt Damon, I think of Team America.
Haha! Too bad those guys don't make a sequel to Team America, it would be totally appropriate now.
I think Matt Damon's best movie was Good Will Hunting back in the 90s.
Really? I thought it was kind of boring.
It was understated! RIP Robin Williams.
Yeah, I was just thinking of Mrs. Doubtfire yesterday and thought of him. He was a brilliant comedian and actor.
