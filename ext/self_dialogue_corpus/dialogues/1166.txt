So you're a 49er fan.  Name some players.
Joe Montana, Jerry Rice, Steve Young, Ronnie Lott, Dwight Clark, Keena Turner, Bubba Paris...
Whoa--current players.
Uh, give me a moment.
Living in the past like all 49er fans.
Hold on, there's Navarro Bowman and Carlos Hyde and uh
Who's the quarterback?
I don't know.
You don't know the quarterback of the team you root for?
Well, I'm not sure they know.
Pretty sad--what's the problem with the team.
The ownership--who gets rid of Jim Harbaugh?
Yeah, he took them to two conference championships and one Super Bowl.
So, oh well, let's get rid of the coach.
Then you have a different coach every year.
Don't remind me--Singletary, Tomsula, Kelly, oh my gosh.
Probably more the management's fault than the coach's.
I suppose.
And now you have Kyle Shanahan
Other than the play call that probably blew the Super Bowl for Atlanta, I think he'll be o.k.
