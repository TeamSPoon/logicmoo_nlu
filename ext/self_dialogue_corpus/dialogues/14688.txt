So sad that the Pistons didn't make the playoffs last season.
Yeah really.  They used to be such a good team.  I mean they are supposed to still be a good team!
Yeah, at least they say they are.  The fact that they couldn't even make the playoffs was just so substandard.
Exactly, I expected better.
That was so awesome when the had some really good players like Joe Dumars back in the 80s.
Yep, that was the pinnacle of it back then.
Though you've got to give the Rasheed Wallace era of the 2000s a fair shake too.
Yeah, he was a great player but he could have handled himself better.
He was a bit of a character, always getting into arguments with referees.
Yeah, he was sort of the John McEnroe of basketball.
Yeah, haha!  That's a good one.
But there was no doubt about his talent or how good of a player he was.
I can't wait to see the new stadium downtown, that is going to be so cool.
Now that you mention it, I was thinking about that the other day!
Big time development downtown, with the new stadium and all the other stuff.
Yeah, finally they get it right and give people a reason to come to Detroit itself, instead of the suburbs!
Now the team just has to be good enough to be worthy of the new stadium, heheh.
Well Tom Gores is a multi billionaire, so if he puts his money to good use, we should have a good team.
Yeah that guy is so cool.  He's a jewish guy from Israel,, did you know that?
Yeah, I think I heard that.  Anyway, he's got to spend some of that money on the team now that we're getting a new stadium.
