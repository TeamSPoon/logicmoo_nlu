Do you like rock music?
Not really.
Why is that?
I've always thought it was too aggressive for me.
Not all rock music is aggressive, though.
Like I said, that's just me. I've at least always had a soft spot for the instrumentals, though.
That's something. Is there any particular instrument that you like?
Probably the bass.
That's unusual.
Bass is so undervalued in music, and it's one of my favorite things about music in general.
