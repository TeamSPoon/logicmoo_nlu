Did you enjoy the new Kendrick Lamar album?
I think so, it touched on alot of themes..
I think he might be the best rapper out there today.
His lyrics are very well written.
Plus he writes about things people care about.
Its refreshing to not hear about bling.
And how much weed he wants to smoke.
He has the talent as an artist.
I think collaborating with Taylor Swift helped him out.
He was big even before he did that.
But I think he got some crossover fans from it.
It is beneficial for an artist to do a guest spot outside of their genre.
I mean I dont know how many little girls crossed over.
But he put his name in their heads
Im surprised we dont see this more in music today.
Yeah they have a good deal of them in country.
I do not care for the genre enough to even want to know.
Its really not that bad when you boil it down.
Some of the lyrics though, talking about how he cant wait to drink a budweiser.
Thats what the genre calls for though
