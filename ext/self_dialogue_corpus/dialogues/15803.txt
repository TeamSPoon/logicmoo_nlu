Hey, have you heard of Ed Sheeran?
I actually haven't, I don't think? Can you tell me something he did?
Sure! One of my favorites is called Perfect.
That sounds good!
Yeah, it's like a love song, it's really pretty.
Cool! I'll check it out! Speaking of artists, have you heard that new song Carrie Underwood?
Hmmm, I'm not sure, what's it called?
It's called Church Bells. I really like it!
I'll definitely check it out! thanks for telling me about it!
You're so welcome!
Oh, goodness. I really like that new one called Lights Down Low.
Hmm, I've not heard that one. who's it by?
It's by MAX. There are two versions, one by just him and one with GNASH.
Hmmm, sounds like another interesting thing to look up. I should write these down.
Have you heard of Pentatonix?
No, who are they?
they're a five-person Acapella group that don't use any instruments for their music. It's all with their mouths.
Ooooh, that sounds cool. Tell me more!
Well, there's the bass, Avi, who can actually hit some crazy low notes, allowing him to sound like an actual bass when they sing. Then there's Kevin, the beatboxer, who does all their beats.
Wow, I'll have to check it out. Even though you told me about two of the group members, it sounds like something I'd really enjoy!
