How is this season gonna play out?
I dunno, it's tough being a Saints fan.
I don't seem them doing much this year.
Drew is still pretty good.
I think his best days are being him.
Yes, and the rest of the team sucks too.
You think Drew is better than Archie Manning?
Yes, Archie was gritty but never won.
He didn't have much of a supporting cast though.
You think Drew does?
Well, you have a point.
Guess we will be the Ain'ts again this year.
Don't give up hope, strange things happen.
Yea, it's a funny shaped ball.
Morten Andersen was automatic back in the day.
Yes he was.
Think we will win the division?
Well, it's a weak division, so there's a chance.
I don't see it happening.
Me neither really.
