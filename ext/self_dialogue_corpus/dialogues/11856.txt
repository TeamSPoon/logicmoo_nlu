Do you think that the Beatles are the greatest band of all time?
I would have to say yes. I can't think of a group that has had more incredible songs.
So true. Songs like All You Need is love just don't come out anymore.
Exactly. I don't think any other group is as well-known as they are either.
Yeah, I don't know of anyone who is unfamiliar with the Beatles.
What is your favorite Beatles album?
Probably A Hard Day's Night. Hard Day's Night is a great song too.
It definitely is. I think my favorite is Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.
I don't think I've heard of that album. When did it come out?
It came out in 1967, after Revolver came out in 1966.
