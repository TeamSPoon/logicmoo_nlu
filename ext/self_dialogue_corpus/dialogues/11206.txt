I absolutely love that dress.
So do I. I got it on sale too.
Do they have any more?
They had a whole rack.
I think I want one.
I'll take you to get it right now if you wan.
OK. Do they have other colors?
They had it in pink. You'll look better in that.
I love how I look in pink.
It does look great on you.
Really? How about blue?
Maybe a light blue.
Did they have any blue ones?
Only really small sizes.
Darn. So let's go get it then.
It's at Fashion Central.
I love that store. Everything there is so cute.
Great prices too.
Even when things aren't on sale I can afford something.
Yes, and that's why I shop there.
