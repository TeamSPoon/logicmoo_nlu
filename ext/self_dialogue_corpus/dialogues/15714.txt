Do you like Katy Perry's work?
It is pretty good. It is pop culture kind of music.
Her latest album Witness was outstanding.
What songs did you like?
Roulette and Hey Hey Hey were my favorites on that album
Tsunami and Swish Swish were good on it too, I enjoy listening to those.
Power was probably my favorite song in the entire album though.
I liked another album of hers the best. It is Prism!
Yes when did that one come out?
It came out in 2013 I believe.
That's right. Roar and Legendary Lovers is on that one.
This Moment and Love Me are my favorites on that one.
She always makes it look so easy.  That is when you can tell someone has a gift.
I know, I have to say I do like her songs, but she is not my favorite.
Who is your favorite singer?
Probably Madonna is my favorite.
It is hard to beat Madonna.
Yes, she has spanned generations with her talent and songs.
What is your favorite?
Like a Virgin is my favorite of Madonna's.
