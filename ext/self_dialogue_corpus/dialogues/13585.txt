Are you a Star Wars fan?
Yeah, I love all the movies.
Even the prequels?
Well, those were okay. I guess I didn't love them.
Yeah, I doubt many people did.
What's your favorite Star Wars movie?
I really like Return of the Jedi. I didn't mind the Ewoks like some people did.
What do you think about The Force Awakens and Rogue One?
I thought they were really good. Of the two I preferred Rogue One.
Yeah, I really liked how they integrated old footage of the X-Wing pilots.
