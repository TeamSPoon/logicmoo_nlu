What's your favorite Zedd song?
Clarity, with Foxes.
Why?
It reminds me of a girl I was madly in love with. The lyrics are exactly how I feel.
Foxes is the name of the singers?
Singer! Singular. She's British.
She's a solo artist and uses a plural name?
Yup! That's just how she is.
That's kind of weird, I'm not going to lie.
Well, at least you like the song, right?
