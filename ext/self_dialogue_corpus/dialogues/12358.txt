how did you like rogue 1
it was cool
they kinda filled in a certain plothole
they did a whole movie to fill that plot hole
the question of how they got the information to beat the death star
so many people died though
yeah and especially during that vader scene
the one of him slashing everyone?
yeah, he was brutal
it was intense
