Ever heard of J. Cole?
The rapper? Yeah, but I'm not a fan.
Why not?
I heard his song "Work Out", and just didn't like it at all.
Don't let that one song influence your opinion of all his music.
Why? Is it different from that song?
Vastly different. He's actually very lyrical, almost like Tupac.
That's a very bold claim.
I can back it up. Listen to "Change" and "High for Hours". You'll understand.
I better not be disappointed.
