What song are you listening to?
It's called To Be Young.  Do you like it?
Yes, who is the singer?
Ryan Adams.  He is my favorite singer.
Is his other music similar?
Well this is kind of more rock and roll than his most recent work.
What are his recent songs like?
I would say they are alt-country
I have never heard of alt-country.  What kind of genre is that?
Its alternative country so it isn't like the pop country that is popular today.  I would compare it more to old country.
When you say old country, do you mean like Johnny Cash?
Yes, among others.
I might have to check it out because I don't normally like country songs these days, but I do like more old fashioned stuff.
Cool, you should also check out Ryan Adam's first band Whiskeytown.
What is a good song to start with?
I like Drank Like a River.  Its on the album Faithless Street.
What else have you been listening to lately?
Nothing too recent, I haven't had time to really check out anything new.  How about you?
I have been listening to a lot of covers by Post-modern Jukebox.
Oh, I like them too.
