Did you see the movie "Extortion"?
The one about the man and wife and boy on vacation in the Caribean?
Yes and they got stranded on an island with no gas or water until those guys pull up in a boat.
That was crazy, wanting a million dollars to save them.
Yeah but it was crazier when they tried to kill him by locking him in the boat and sinking it.
That guy had like 9 lives through the whole movie.
I know, and the whole time his wife and kid are still on the island.
He went through hell, getting shot, stabbed, hooked, and still survived.
and that mexican he found that knew where the island was gets hit by a truck.
Yeah that was stupid, and whispers his last words where his family was.
