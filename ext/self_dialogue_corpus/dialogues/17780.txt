Did you watch America's Got Talent last year?  Specifically, Grace Vanderwall?
No.  I have no idea who that is.
Dont blame you.  But she was astonishing to me.
Why?
She's this 11-12 year old girl, cute as can be.  She walks out on the stage for her first performance carrying a yukele and says she'll be playing an original song.
Thats usually the kiss of death.
I know and I was expecting nothing from it.  And I was wrong.
Really?  She was  good?
She was a revelation.  She was soooo good.
Wow, that's amazing.  Was it just the one song?
On that night, but she went on and played 3 or 4 more songs, all original, all great.  And she won the competition.
I'll have to look her up.
You should, she's a talented little girl.  Folk-pop kind of music.
Thats right up my alley.
I know, thats why I'm telling you.
So did she put out an album?
She put out an EP late last year with 5 or so songs, one of which was new (not on the show).
Cool.  Ill listen to her stuff online and see if I want to buy it.
She just put out another song too, which is really good.  I think a full length album is on the way.
Wow, and she's only 11 or 12?  Amazing.
