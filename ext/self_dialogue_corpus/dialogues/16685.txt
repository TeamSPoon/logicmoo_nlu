Will music work?
Yes, what types do you like?
All of them.  You?

Yes.
Me too, did you see the voice last season with Tim Mcgraw and faith hill?
Yes they were amazing
Faith was funny, she's so nice
She is, and her voice is amazing
It is, they make a great duo together.
I agree, I love the songs they do together.
They are definitely a country music power couple.
Yes, and they sounds great by themselves too
I love all of tims songs
He's a really good artist
He's the one that sings my best friend, right?
Yes I love that song, it was one of my choices for my wedding song
That would make a great wedding song.
I thought so, I went in a different direction though.
What song?
