Who won the Superbowl last year again?
Oh gosh, I think the Falcons?
The Falcons? I'm asking about the 2016 game.
Yeah, Patriots versus Falcons, wasn't it?
I think the Patriots won that one.
Oh, well why did you ask then?
I don't know, I guess your wrong answer fueled my memory.
Ha ha, well if it was the Patriots like you said they are unstoppable.
Not really, I mean I'm sure they've lost before.
Of course they have, but they've won so much lately.
They have like 5 titles, don't they?
Something like that, I know other teams have more though.
I know for certain the Packers have won the most titles.
Since the NFL was created?
Yep, they've won 13.
And how do you know that exactly?
My family are huge Packers fans and bring it up every season.
Ha ha, well good on your family and the Packers.
I don't think they've won in a while though.
Probably not, but I'm sure they will again soon.
