Do you like Celtic music.
Tradional or modern?
Evet hear of the Waterboys?
Is that the band Mike Scott used to be in?
Yeah.
I have heard a little.  Something about fishing, perhaps?
Fishermans  Blues.  One of my favorite albums of all time!
Is that the one that has a song that puts a Yeats poem to music?
Yes, 'The Lake Isle of Innisfree'.  I got to go there once, in County Sligo.
Lucky!  I love Yeats.
Me too.  There are traditional songs on it, as well.
What else?
'When will we be married, Molly'.  That song will stick in my head now.
That drives me crazy, if it's not a song you love.
I worked in a pub once and would start singing Mr. Rogers 'It's a beautiful day in the neighborhood' too make it happen to everyone!  It was a riot.
You are a sick, sick person.
Yes, I am that.
That is the worst song to have running through your head!
You know what is worse, 'Mack the Knife'!!  "Oh the shark has such teeth dear, and he keeps them pearly white........
Noooooo!!!!  That is  cruel and unusual punishment!!!!!!!
