What do you think of Darth Vadar?
I thought he was a very interesting character. I liked seeing the progression he made.
Ya it was interesting seeing the first three movies and seeing him a boy knowing he would become Darth Vadar.
I liked how at the end he came back to the light.
Ya I really liked that also. I wonder if Luke struggled with Darth Vadar being his father.
I think he probably did. I'm curious to see what happens with Luke in the new film.
I agree do you think he is related to Rey.
I don't know. I could see her being related to Obi Wan.
That's a good guess they do both sound the same and there is a lot about Obi Wan we don't know.
I felt the same way about Obi Wan. I want to learn more about him.
