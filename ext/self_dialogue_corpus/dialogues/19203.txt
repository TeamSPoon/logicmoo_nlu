Did you take any music lessons in school?
Yes  I did.
What instrument did you play?
The trumpet.
That must have been hard to learn.
A little, It was more hard to blow into it.
I took the drums.
Well at least that is cooler than the trumpet.
I suppose.
Were you in the band?
Yes I was. We had to practice ALL the time.
We did too.
But it was fun, I got to be in the parades with the drums.
That sounds fun.
And we had a lot of school concerts, did you?
Yes we did, every spring we had a concert.
Do you still play the trumpet?
A little. I forgot a lot of it.
I still drum. My grandkids love it.
I'll bet! You will have to teach them.
