Did you hear that Jay-Z was dropping a new album?
No way i had no clue. What's it called?
4:44
Really? I been seeing ads for it all over the city but it didn't say what it was for.
I guess that was all apart of the marketing plan just to get people to look into it.
I hope this album is worth listen to. I want that old Jay-Z back.
Yeah i want that Reasonable Doubt, Blueprint, Black Album Jay-Z.
Just because it's Jay-Z it's gonna sell big time.
I think the only way to get it is through Tidal.
That's until the internet gets a hold of it then it'll be everywhere.
