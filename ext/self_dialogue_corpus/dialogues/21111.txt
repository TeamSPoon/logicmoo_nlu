I watched Secret Killer last night. What a great movie!
What was it about?
It's about hunting a killer in a red cape who's killing American tourists and cutting out their eyes.
It sounds like an Umberto Lenzi giallo I saw called called Eyeball.
Lenzi directed this one too. Maybe it's the same movie.
It is, I just looked it up. Just an alternate title.
Did you like it?
Yes, it was good! I've seen a few of Lenzi's films.
Did you see So Sweet and So Perverse?
Yes, with Carrol Baker from Baby Doll!
I like her too. She was in a few other Lenzi movies.
Really? What else?
Knife of Ice and Quiet Place to Kill, and one or two more I think.
She was cute!
Yea, a real babydoll!
Ahuh! Funny!
Did you see her in Harlow?
Harlow? I don't think so.
She played Jean Harlow. It was like a docudrama about her life.
Sounds like something I might like.
