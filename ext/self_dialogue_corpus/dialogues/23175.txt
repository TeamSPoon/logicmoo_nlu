What's your favorite David Fincher movie?
Hm, that's a good question.
Please don't say Fight Club.
But it's so good!
Yeah, it's good, but I never really got that into it.
Why not?
I like the ending after the twist, but before that it's just so over the top with the violence.
Isn't it like a commentary on masculinity?
Is it though? It always seemed more like it was glorifying it.
I don't think so. Everything goes badly in the end!
Only sort of, though.
We never even know if Tyler and Marla live when the buildings come down.
i think they do live, since they were talking about it as a place to watch the show.
Yeah, true. I just don't think the end justifies the means, you know?
Okay, I sort of get what you're saying.
You should check out other movies that are hard to figure out if you're into that.
Yeah, I should.
You should try Donnie Darko or Mulholland Drive.
Ah, Mulholland Drive is great.
I know, one of my favorite movies.
