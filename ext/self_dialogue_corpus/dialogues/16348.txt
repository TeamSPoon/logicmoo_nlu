Have you heard any new music lately?
I just bought the New John Mayer Album.
Nice! How is it?
I like it. There are some catchy songs on it.
What's it called?
The Search For Everything.
How does it compare to his other albums?
It is good but not as good as his earlier work.
Interesting. Any other new music?
I bought the new New Found Glory album too.
Is it good?
Actually, I am quite disappointed in it.
Why's that?
The songs are very generic. It seems like they rushed through making it.
That doesn't sound good. Are there any good songs on it?
Honestly, I don't think there are any memorable songs on the album.
All I've been listening to for the last two month is Kendrick Lamar.
Nice! His new album is amazing.
So good! We have to see him in concert when he's in town.
I can't wait!
