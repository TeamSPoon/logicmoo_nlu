I think I'm going to watch a few games in the superdome this season
Oh yeah, I don't like indoor stadiums that much.
It is a little odd but it's fun how loud it gets.
Don't you hate that the seahawks stole the 12th man slogan
Ugh yes. That totally originated in New Orleans
I hate everything about the Seahawks and their bandwagon fans
Me too. Without Marshawn Lynch they are nothing
I do like Russel Wilson though
Yeah he's a solid QB
Who's your favorite NFL QB?
Right now it's probably Cam Newton
He's good. I'm into Aaron Rodgers.
I wish the Packers could win a superbowl
I know. They get so close every year.
How far did they get last year?
They lost to the vikings in regular season
How did the vikings end up doing?
They lost to the Seahawks
That's a bummer
Yeah. They still went 11-5 though.
