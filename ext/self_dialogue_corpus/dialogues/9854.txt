So, how do you like rap music?
I love it, Snoop Dog is the best to ever do it.
Really? I would take a lot of other rappers over him.
I love his style, who do you think is better?
I would say Tupac, Eminem, and Jay Z just to name a few.
They are all talented, but Snoop can flow like nobody else.
Have you ever listened to Eminem's tracks?
I recently heard Lose Yourself. That was a good song.
Yea that one always gets me pumped.
I would love to see him spin something with Snoop.
