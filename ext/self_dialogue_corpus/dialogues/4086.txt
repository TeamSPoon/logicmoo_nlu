Have you ever seen Event Horizon?
What was it about?
There was a spaceship and they were having trouble reaching it.  So they sent out a crew.
Did they make it there?
Yeah, but when they did, no one was on the ship.
Okay, but where did they go?
That's what the movie is about.  There is evil or something on the ship.
Wow, this sounds good.  When did it come out?
Probably about fifteen years ago.
Cool, I'll have to look into that.
