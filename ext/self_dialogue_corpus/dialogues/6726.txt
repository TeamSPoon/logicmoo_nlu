What are your favorite Disney movies?
My favorites are Sleeping Beauty, Cinderella, The Little Mermaid and Aladdin
Those are great. I love Sleeping Beauty and Cinderella too.
I think Maleficent is one of the scariest Disney villains.
I agree, she's so dark and violent.
What was your favorite part of Sleeping Beauty?
Actually the ending. When she's dancing with the Prince and her dress is changing colors. You?
I liked when the fairies gave up and used their magic wands to get the cottage ready.
That was cool, but that is what caused the raven to see they were there.
You're right I forgot about that. He was circling the chimney!
