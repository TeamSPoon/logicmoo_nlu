The Buffalo game is on.
Ok great.
Buffalos are in the lead now.
Not for long!
What???
The Tigers will catch up!
You wish.
They've got Damon on the field.
And we've got Simon Dills!
He's trash!
He's had better seasons, but still good.
Not good.
I think he's on his way out.
We'll see tonight!
Touchdown!!
No!!!
This game is heating up.
It sure is.
Let's go Buffalos, let's go!
Tigers eat buffalos for dinner!
