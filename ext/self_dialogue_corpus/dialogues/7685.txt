Have you seen the last Harry Potter movie?  Deathly Hallows Part 1 and 2.
Yes, I've seen those.
Did you like it?
Not really.  I'm generally a fan of Harry Potter, but I didn't like the Deathly Hallows much.
Why didn't you like it?
It seemed too serious.  The children had grown up and the feel of the movie changed in a negative way.
So you're a fan of the earlier movies?
Absolutely.  I really enjoy every other Harry Potter movie.
Which one would you say is your favorite?
That's a tough decision to make because they are all really good.  I suppose the Goblet of Fire would be my favorite.
