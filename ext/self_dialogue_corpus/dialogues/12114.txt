I could talk about Star Wars all day.
Bring it on - I'm ready!
Actually, I don't know that much about Star Wars.
What?  Have you at least seen the older trilogy?
Yes, but it was a long time ago.  Sometimes I forget everything.
Well, you should clear your weekend schedule and see them all.
What did you think about the new one, Rogue One.
It's more of an offshoot rather than following the original story.
I think it's time for some spin-offs.
I'll stick with Darth, Luke and Han Solo.
