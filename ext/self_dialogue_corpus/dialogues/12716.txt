Have you seen Episode VII yet?
I did. I thought it was pretty good.
My only complaint is how derivative it is of Episode IV.
It was at that. But all I asked was that it be better than the prequels.
Yes, my expectations were set very low as well.
I like the new generation of the cast, though.
How did you feel about Han Solo's death?
I understood why it happened, but there will be a real hole in the sequels without Harrison's charisma.
I didn't like that we only saw Luke Skywalker for a few seconds, but I suppose you don't want to cram too much into the movie.
Yes, overall I'd say the movie was the first solid Star Wars movie since Episode VI.
