What do you think is the most underrated album by a rapper?
It would have to be 808s & Heartbreak by Kanye West.
Oh, right? People are always talking trash on that one, but it's probably my favorite one of his.
Well, my favorite Kanye album is still College Dropout, but Heartbreak is still excellent.
Remember when Through the Wire came out?
Yes! I had MTV on, and I was just cleaning house. That song came on, and I swear I'd never heard it before in my life. I just stopped what I was doing and watched the whole thing.
Yeah, it was really different from anything out at the time. Kanye kind of took over after that.
He did. It's too bad he ends up saying so much outlandish stuff on TV now.
I feel really bad for him. He can't enjoy the negativity that comes from all that.
No, but maybe it gives him more stuff to write about.
