have you ever listened to young jeezy
I think so, he's all about the trap scene right?
yeah that's him
they should just call him jeezy now
why is that
because he isn't so young anymore
I really thought thug motivation 101 and 102 were really his best
probably. I think come shop with me was pretty good too
he is rap icon
who do you think is an up and comer in the rap scene now
not sure, I still like some of the older stuff better
big boi, young jeezy and killer mike just put out a new track
that sounds cool, what is it called?
its called kill jill, its pretty good
I'll have to check that out. where do i know the name big boi from?
he was a part of Outkast!
oh yeah, that's right, i like it
yeah, all three of those guys on the same song
killer mike is of dubious fame though
what? killer mike is a LEGEND!
