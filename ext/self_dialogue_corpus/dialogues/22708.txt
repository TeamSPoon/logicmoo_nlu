I loved Talladega Nights
I thought it was an OK comedy.
Who had the best role in it?
Sasha Baron Cohen played the best part.
He always plays a non-English kind of character.
He is a bit typecasted.
And you dont mind that?
No not really.
You didnt like Will Ferrell in the movie?
Yeah I thought he was OK.
I thought it was filled with hilarious one liners
Oh yeah they were definitely filled with them.
Did you like the way the movie flowed?
No I think some of the parts were too drawn out.
They didnt need to show his father's decline
Yeah I thought just keep it light hearted.
But his wife was hilarious too
Yeah she played a funny part.
What was your favorite scene?
When they were around the dinner table and the boys were mouthing off to their grandfather
