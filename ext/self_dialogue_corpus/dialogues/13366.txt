Did you watch the latest Star Wars movie?
The Force Awakens, yes.
No, the other one, Rogue One
I didn't catch that one
Really? It was pretty good.
Who was in it?
No real big named actors, but everyone in it did a good job
Hmmm, I'll have to check it out
Yes, for sure. I highly recommend it
Okay, I'm all for a good Star Wars movie
