Have you ever seen the Evil Dead series?
I've seen the show but not the movies.
Oh you have to see the movies. The show isn't as good.
I like it a lot Bruce Campbell is hilarious.
He is. The show is funny but just not as good as the movies.
Which one is the best?
They're all good but the first one is probably the worst.
Why? Usually the first is the best.
I think he was trying to make it a serious horror movie. But it was so bad that it ended up being funny.
So why are the other ones better?
Well it seems like Sam Raimi embraced the humor in the rest of them and focused on making them funny.
That's hilarious. Do they play out chronologically?
I think so. But I'm a little confused about it.
Why is that?
Well the same thing happens in both part one and two. I can't tell if it's a remake or a sequel.
Have you ever looked it up?
No but I should.
Well either way you've convinced me to check em out.
You'll understand the show better too if you watch em.
Ok. Thanks.
