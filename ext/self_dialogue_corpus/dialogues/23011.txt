Hey I finally saw the new Star Trek movie.
What did you think?
It was great. Just as good as the first two.
I haven't seen any of those yet.
What??? That really surprises me.
I want to. But I was busy when the first one came out and just missed it.
The reboots are fantastic.
Hmmm I've heard some complaints.
Don't listen to them. See the movies and judge for yourself.
Okay I'll do that.
HAHAHA Yeah that sounds like a "I want to do it but I'll probably be to busy and end up not doing it"
It's true.
Look I own the first two. Come over this weekend. I get a pizza and we'll watch.
Alright. I'm down for that.
Trust me you will like them. The casting is perfect and the direction is on point.
And I do like Zoe Saldana.
She is definitely the queen of Sci-fi right now.
Well deserved. Avatar, Guardians, and Trek
I love her. She can't do wrong.
HAHAHA. I don't know about that. But her sci-fi stuff rocks
