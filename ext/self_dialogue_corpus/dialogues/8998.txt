One of my favorite bands of all time used to be AFI.
A lot of people don't like them.
I think maybe because they changed in style but loved the evolution.
I agree they used to be just straight up punk.
What is your favorite album by them?
It is a tie between The Art of Drowning and Sing the Sorrow.
I can hear the song in my head that starts like your sins into me.
Oh my beautiful one, yes that is an awesome song.
I haven't listened to AFI in a while wonder how they evolved now.
Probably more emo and pop.
