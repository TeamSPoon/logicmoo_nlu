Are you excited about the upcoming Justice League movie
Hell yeah, I hope it will be good
Me to, Batman vs Superman was just ok
I likes it at first, but got worse each time I watched it.
They need to take a page from Mavel's book
I know, they hit a grand slam every time.
I think they may be bringing the JLA together to fast
That's what I think
Marvel took their time and developed each character individually first
and DC is just jumping right in
I think It may be a big mistake
I hope not, I love the Justice League
Superman has always been my favorite character of all time
I can't believe they had Batman kick his ass
I was so pissed at that.  There are over 1000 ways Superman could beat batman without getting close to him
It is such bullshit
I hope they have good writers for this movie
They have a lot riding on it so hopefully they took there timd
They need to let the guys who write the animated series do the movie
There cartoons are much better than their movies
