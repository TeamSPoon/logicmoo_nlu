Have you seen that thriller movie, 'Split'?
Is that the one about a man with multiple personalities who kidnaps some girls?
Yeah. James McAvoy did a really good job playing that character. I was creeped out every time he came on screen.
It's an M. Night Shyamalan film, isn't it?
Yeah, that's the director.
He's pretty famous for his thrillers.
Yeah, he even directed 'The Sixth Sense.' That's got to be a classic by now.
Would you say 'Split' measures up to his other films?
I'd say it's one of his best. It's actually a sequel to the thriller movie, 'Unbreakable.'
Oh, yeah. That's the one about people with superhuman powers.
