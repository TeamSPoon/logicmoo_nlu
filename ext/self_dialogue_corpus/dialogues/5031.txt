What do you think of the American League so far this year?
Hard to talk about the AL without mentioning the Yankees.
I know, right? What's going on there?
Somehow they're cranking out wins left and right.
Do you think it could be because they've been playing a lot of interleague games.
Maybe. But they're doing pretty well otherwise.
Yeah, that's for sure. I can't believe it myself.
Who do you like on the team?
Well, Betances is playing well as usual. But Judge is really knocking balls out of the park.
Yes, I think he has strong Rookie of the Year potential.
Okay, so that's the Yankees. What else?
Well, the East is stacked! How about the Orioles?
Okay, they're fine. The Red Sox aren't bad either.
I suppose there's the Twins, but they won't last. We all know there's one other team looming large.
Yes, Houston. Best record in the AL. Can it last?
It can, it can. They have a great rotation.
They're playing in the weakest division.
By far. It'll help them win games, but it'll mean their competition isn't as strong.
Could it be a disadvantage in the postseason?
Yes, it could. It definitely could.
