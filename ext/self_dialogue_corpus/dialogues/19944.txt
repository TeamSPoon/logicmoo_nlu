Hey bro
Hey man
Well i think i found something interesting
What did you find that was interesting?
I found this new type of music
What do you mean new
Like i have never heard anything like it before
Well describe it to me
You literally make noise to make music
But is it not what music already is
You know exactly what  i mean
No i do not man
Well like you make noises like machines and tools to make noise and you use it to make music
Oh well that is different
It really is different than what you normally get in music
Does it sound good though
That is a difficult question to answer
Why is that
Because it is literally noise music and i like it but also seems odd to not like it
That is a weird reaction to it i would say
