There's a new album out by Alicia Keys
Really ? I've been hiding away for so long.
You will want to listen to it.
You are tempting..
I am. It is very tastefully crafted
That is my kind of music.
It is about a difficult moment in her life.
Did something bad happen to her?
Bad things. Some you don't want me to mention here.
That is terrible.
It is but music heals.
True. Is the music as soulful as in the last album?
This is probably more soulful
What is new?
She features a guest artist
Who could that be?
I'll let you guess once.
Are the two related?
Yes, very close.
I knew it had to be Beats
