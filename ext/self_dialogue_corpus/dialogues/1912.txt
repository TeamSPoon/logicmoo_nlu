How about them Cowboys?
What about them?
Do you think they'll be any good this year?
Well, they have Elliott..
So that's good?
Yea he's a great player.
I miss the old Cowboys team
Oh, me too.
Emmitt Smith
Number 22 - the best!
Troy Aikman
At least he's still announcing!
The 90's Cowboys were so great.
How do you feel about Romo.
Eh. He had some good days, some bad days.
I agree.
I just wish we'd get into the Superbowl this year
That'd be the dream!
Imagine if it was the Cowboys vs the Patriots?
America's most love to hate teams!
