We have been watching Rapuzel a lot lately.
Really? Guess someone at your house really likes it?
It is a cute movie. Pretty funny characters.
I have only see it once.
Paschal, the chameleon is great. I liked Max. He did not even have any lines but he was funny!
I need to invest it a frying pan. That was her weapon of choice, right?
Ha Ha! Yes, she knew how to use it too.
I wanted her to use it against Gothel.
The boat scene is my favorite.
Flynn and Rapunzel do make a cute couple.
