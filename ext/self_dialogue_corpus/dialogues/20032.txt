What do you think of the High Kings?
Awesome Irish folk type music, right?
Definitely. That's a genre I love.
I do too. I wish I could listen to it all day long.
Pandora has two great stations for it.
I don't use Pandora. Is it worth it?
It definitely is. There's an Irish pub rock station and a Celtic rock station.
I definitely want to check those out.
They make it worth it just to hear them.
I do have one of those car radios that allow me to stream music from Pandora.
Let's listen on the way to the expo then.
Sure but you'll have to help me set it up.
No problem. We'll use my account till you figure out if you'll like it.
What sorts of things do they play on those stations you mentioned?
Flogging Molly, The High Kings, Gaelic Storm, et cetera.
Sounds like it's right up my alley.
That's what I figured when I found them. I know you love that stuff.
I really do. It's my favorite music.
Mine too probably.
I'm probably going to want my own Pandora account now.
