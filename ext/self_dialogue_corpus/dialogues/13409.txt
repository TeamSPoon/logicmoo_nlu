Which star wars movie is your favorite?
The first one definitely, its originality was awe inspiring.
The first one really? Mine was The Empire Strikes back.
Why did you like that one more than the others?
Well simply because Darth Vader is my favorite character in any of the movies.
That's funny because Qui Gon Jin and Obi Wan Kenobi are my favorite characters.
Oh, so that's why you like the first movie so much, haha.
Yep, and Its crazy that Obi Wan was killed by Darth Vader.
Yeah that scene was pretty weird, it almost seemed like he just let himself get killed.
Well, I think what he was doing is transcending to a spiritual level like other jedi did when they died, I read something about how a jedi can do that if he is powerful enough. His body was missing when he was killed so I would think that is what happened.
