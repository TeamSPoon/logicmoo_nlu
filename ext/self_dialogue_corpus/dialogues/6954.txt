Did you know that Disney was inspired by Shakespeare?
What? I thought they took inspiration from like fairytales and stuff.
Well, that too, but some people say The Lion King is basically just Hamlet with lions.
I guess that makes sense, with the whole father dying angle and such.
Yes, and then Simba has to eventually slay his uncle--who is maybe married to his mother now?
I think Simba has a happier ending than Hamlet does, though.
That's certainly true, he doesn't wind up dying for one!
And he gets to sing better songs and hook up with Nala in the end.
I shipped Nala and Simba so hard as a kid.
Well, Nala was surprisingly cute for an animated lion!
