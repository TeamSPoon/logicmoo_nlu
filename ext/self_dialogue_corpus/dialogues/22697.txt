do you like sofia coppola?
Yes , I think she has put out some great films.
What is your top pick?
Lost in Translation or virgin suicides.
I preferred Virgin Suicides.
Really? why is that?
Not sure , maybe enjoyed the plot more.
I love the song playground love by air in that film.
Ya I adore that track.
Interesting kirsten dunst is going to be in her new movie too!
I think directors do that a lot, work the same actors over and over again.
Yes true with johnny depp and Tim Burton.
Burton also uses helena boham carter frequently as well.
True, I guess they develop a good work relationship.
I can see that you want to have trust and that is built over time and multiple projects.
Yep another good example is David Lynch and Kyle MacLachlan.
They are one of the strongest examples.
I am so into the new twin peaks , have you seen it?
I saw the first 2 episodes of the new ones, waiting for all to binge.
I would love to do a marathon starting with the film prequel, Fire walk with me, all the way through!
