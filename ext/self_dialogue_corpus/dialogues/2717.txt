Are you watching the game this Sunday?
Yeah, for sure. I'm a huge Broncos fan.
Oh haha. They're playing the Browns, so I'm going to be rooting for them.
Well, we can still be friends. The Browns will never win.
Yes, some say that the Browns will win the Superbowl when hell freezes over.
They keep firing all their coaches, that's why.
Yes, they do need to find a good coach and stick with him.
And they have some crazy players too. At least there is nothing as bad as Jim Tressel's scandal at the college level.
Right, just rivalries.
Other divisions have rivalries too, though.
I'll stick with the Browns, though.
Whatever floats your boat. When was the last time they even won the Superbowl?
Not even answering that. Maybe it's because they don't have any good players like the Mannings.
Peyton Manning's not so hot now..
He was good for the longest time.
Yes, Peyton Manning and Brett Farve are some of the best career players.
Brett Farve did NOT know when to retire.
Wonder how he could throw if he was still playing now.
Pretty badly. Still, the Vikings aren't doing well nowadays.
Perhaps they'll beat the Broncos today.
