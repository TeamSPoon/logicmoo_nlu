What is the best part of Brave?
The fight at the end is awesome.
Yeah, that was very suspenseful.
It was sad, but then I was glad when her mom became human again.
I liked the accents in that movie.
Yeah, they were good.
Where did it take place?
I think it was inspired by Scotland
Okay, that makes sense.
I loved the archery scene too.
