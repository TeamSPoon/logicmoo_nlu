Do you like Lorde?
I've only heard her singles, but they're okay.
I think she's really talented for someone so young.
Oh, I didn't know. How old is she?
She's 20 now, but I think she was 17 when she made her first album.
Oh wow, that is really young. I didn't know. That's impressive.
I think she'll be around for a really long time.
I saw she's releasing her 3rd album already.
Yes, this year. She's already so creative for someone so young.
I'll have to keep an eye out for more stuff from her.
