do you think the cardinals will do something this season?
you mean arizona?
yeah?
man i doubt it.
why you say that?
carlson palmer can't win the big game.
what?
how many playoff wins does he have?
i don't know.
he has one playoff win.
was that with the bengals?
heck no. he got traded from the bengals because he couldn't win in the playoffs.
he has a win with arizona?
that one year when they beat the packers.
yeah that's right. and then got destroyed by carolina.
carolina beat them boys like they stole something.
didn't they beat them by like five touchdowns?
almost. they beat them by 34 points.
i think this may be palmer's year this season.
i doubt it. arizona are an after-thought.
