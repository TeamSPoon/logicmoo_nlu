Should the NBA realign?
Just have one big league?
No just go into a conference?
So eliminate division winners?
Yes that way seeding would be correct
Yeah I think thats the way it should be
Wow we agree on something.
Yeah I think the emphasis on winning the division doesnt matter anymore.
If a team is good home court shouldnt matter?
I mean that in a way where its not important as you think
So we overvalue home court?
I think so.
Thats pretty different.
I think thats a pretty good observation.
Yeah you can see where the league is headed no one has an advantage.
The Cavaliers could win on any court
Thats why they didnt care about regular season wins.
Wouldnt it matter in the Finals?
They should flip a coin ever year
Or have it rotate.
