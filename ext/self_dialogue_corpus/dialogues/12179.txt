What do you like most about Yoda?
Well, I think Yoda is one of the coolest characters in all the Star Wars movies. I'd have to think about it.
Well, I really like how he lives in the middle of no where in a swamp.
Yeah, that's pretty cool.
So have you thought about what you like best about him yet?
I think it's really cool that he lived for hundreds of years.
Yeah, it's hard to believe how long Yoda was around.
You would think that after all that time, he would be stronger than any Sith Lord.
Well, some of them master the force faster than others, like Annakin did.
That's true, I just wish Yoda was more powerful I guess.
