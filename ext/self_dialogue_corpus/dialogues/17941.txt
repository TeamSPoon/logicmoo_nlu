What kind of music do you like?
Classic rock, country some jazzy stuff.
Do you like Kenny Chesney?
He is ok, not my favorite.  I prefer Luke or Dirks.
I like both of them too but Kenny is my favorite.  What is your favorite Luke Bryant song?
"This is how I roll" is probly my favorite song of his, what about you?
I like his Hunting & Fishing song.  My neighbor lives that song, he wants to become a hunting guide.
Oh Yea?  I kinda lived the Dirks song aobut Drunk on a Plane.
Really?  Sorry to hear that, its a fun song but about a guy who was left at the alter.
Well I wasn't left at the alter, but my girl did leave.  So I went on a little vacation and kinda got drunk with a stewardess.
Did she know that song?
Yea she did.  It was funny.  I started singing it after my 3rd drink and she just laughed and joined in.
What a great music story.  Any other ones you have?
Well after we landed I she had a few days off and we pretty much stayed drunk and kept singing Margaritiville by Jimmy Buffet.
Yea, thats a good one to drink to.  I always liked Garth Brooks, Friends in Low Places as well.
Ha Ha, yea we did that one too.  We toasted our ex's with it.
Ha ha.  Cole Swinde's Aint Worth the Whiskey is another good one to do that with.
I think I know that one, next time I will add that to my list.
Next time?  You plan on doing this again?
Heck Yea.  I have a date with her next week when she flys in from Cali.  We are going to a Karoke Bar downtown, gonna sing and drink all night.
