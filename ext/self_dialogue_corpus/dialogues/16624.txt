I'm so excited I get to see Rhett and Link in person in December!!
Who are they? Some kind of band?
Well, yeah, sort of. They're going to be performing some of their music.
What does that mean?
Well, they're a YouTube comedy duo that do a lot of music, so they're going to do that and sketches at their show.
What kind of music?
Like I said, it's comedy, but they sing a lot of different genres like pop, rap, country, etc.
Sounds like quite the variety.
Yeah, and their songs are so funny! My favourite one is about being afraid of the dark.
Haha, okay. What else do they sing about?
Oh, so many things. Belly buttons, best friends, bbq, even water tabs!
...How do you make a song about water tabs?
Well, it's a pretend break up song because no one ever wants to use the water dispensing tab at a restaurant.
Okay, that's kinda weird. How long have they been doing this?
They've been creating music online since 2007, but they've been best friends since they met in 1st grade--over thirty years ago.
That's a long time! So can they actually sing, or do they autotune it?
No, they actually sing really well. Their harmonies are really great.
Impressive. Where did you say I'd find them?
On their YouTube channels, RhettandLink and Good Mythical Morning, and also on Google Play.
Awesome, I know what I'm listening to this afternoon!
