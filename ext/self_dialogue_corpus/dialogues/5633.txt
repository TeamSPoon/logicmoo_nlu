Do you think any disney movies are overrated?
Definetely, quite a few actually.
I think Cinderella is, honestly.
Yes! Thank you.
Yeah, I just feel like it's not THAT good of a story, you know?
Totally, I also don't really like Sleeping Beauty.
Agreed, it's overplayed.
Yes, just like music!
We are particular on Disney movies, aren't we?
Just a tad, but there's a lot to critique.
