So what do you think of the Raveonettes?
I've never heard of them.
You're in luck!
Why do you say that?
They are a phenomenal band.  They're easily one of my favorites.
Sounds interesting.  What kind of music is it?
Frankly, it's really hard to place.  You can hear so many different influences in their music?
Really?  Like what, exactly?
New Wave, grunge, metal, folk.  It's amazing!
Wow.   Does that combination really work?
It sure does.  You have to check them out!
Might I have heard any of their songs?
I doubt it but check out the Observator album.
Are there any songs in particular?
Yes, I would start with The Enemy and Observations.
OK, I'll do that!  Is it a consistent album?
They can be a little spotty but it's definitely worth it!
OK, I'll give them a listen.
Do you want to borrow the album?
No, I appreciate it but I can find some youtube videos.  Thanks!
