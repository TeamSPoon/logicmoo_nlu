We just watched Moana.
I love that movie.
Me too. Hey Hey made me laugh so many times.
My favorite character was Maui.
I really enjoyed the scene in the beginning when the ocean opens around her.
I loved it when her grandmother returns to her in the ocean.
My daughters love the scene where she returns the heart to Te Fiti
The songs are also so great. We love Thank You, as well as How far I'll go
It has some beautiful messages.
Its a really great movie for adults and kids.
