Are you a fan of foreign movies?
I would not go so far as to say I'm a fan, but I have watched foreign movies.
Have you seen any Korean movies?
Remind me of a big Korean movie again?
Well a lot of Korean movies have gotten attention lately, but Oldboy is one a lot of people talk about.
That one is pretty old, right?  Remind me of that one again?
It had a crazy plot.  Basically I'd say it was a double revenge plot.
Ok, go on.  I may remember this.
So the guy think he's out for revenge, but it turns out the person messing with him was seeking his own revenge.
Oh yea!  I remember it now.  It was super graphic and violent too.
Yes.  It had some really good scenes.
Yea, I remember where he's in a hallway fighting like one hundred guys with just a hammer.
Yep, it was a terrific movie overall.  Very fresh.
Yes. I have to be honest with you, I just don't watch that many foreign movies.
No, I get you.  I mean it's impossible just keeping up with the big Hollywood movies.
There is an older Chinese martial arts type movie I really like.
Oh really, what is it called?
Hero, starring Jet Li.
Oh my gosh, I really liked that movie too!
Right?  I thought that movie did a lot of things right, in terms of acting, action, and beautiful scenery.
