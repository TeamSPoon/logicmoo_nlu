What do you think about the Mandela Effect  concerning Star Wars?
I am not sure I know what you are talking about.
Empire Strikes Back the scene where Luke finds out Darth Vader is his dad. What is the line that Darth says?
Luke I am your Father.
Yes that's what I remember and a lot of other people as well.
So what are you saying? That it's wrong?
According to some fans they insist he "No, I am your father" not Luke I am your father.
What? I may not be as big of a nerd about Star Wars as you are but i know Luke is right.
Yes there are interviews of James Earl Jones back in the day and when asked to quote that scene he says Luke.
Who would know better than him? That's really weird.
