Who is your favorite 70's rock artist
I am a big fan of KISS
Wow, they really are popular
Yeah, their song I was made for loving you is one of my top songs of all time
why is that
because the energy used in that song is out of this world
I cant disagree. Who is your favorite KISS member
I like Gene Simmons
Cool, I've seen documentaries on him. He looks like a cool guy in real life
Yeah I've met him before and he was really nice
