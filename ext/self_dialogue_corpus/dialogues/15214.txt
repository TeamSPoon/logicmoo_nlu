Do you think you will come see Ludacris this fall with me?
No I really don't think I will get the time off to see him.
That stinks. I really hoped you would get to hear some of the songs you listened to back in the day.
You are telling me! I love Ludacris!
I think that TI is going to be there with him too.
You really think so? Maybe I'll skip work.
I think you should. It is a once in a lifetime concert.
I really love the CD Red Light District.
Yeah I have had that CD playing in my car all week. It is so amazing!
Do you think I could borrow it to get in the mood to go to the concert?
Absolutely! I really love track 2, Number One Spot.
That is my favorite too. It was all over the radio back in the day!
Do you think we could use your connection to get back stage at the concert?
Oh I think I could talk to him. He usually likes to trade free spots back there for some music!
What kind of music does he like?
He really loves alternative rock music!
That is kind of weird for a guy who is always at Rap concerts! I'll look and see what I have around the house.
I will look too. I think I have a whole box full of CDs he would want.
Great! I think this will be the greatest night of our lives.
I can't wait to go to this concert with you! You really convinced me!
