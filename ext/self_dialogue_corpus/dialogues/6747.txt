So Moana came out on DVD and I didn't think much of it?
Really?  Why's that?
Well, I just didn't think the songs were as catchy as some other movies.
I don't quite agree with you.  They were unique and totally fit in with the movie.
I guess I was just expecting more.  The animation was pretty good though.
I kind of thought Maui was a bit too big though.
Really?  He's supposed to be larger than life.
Yeah, maybe it's just the Rock I don't like.
Everyone loves the Rock!
Everybody but me!
