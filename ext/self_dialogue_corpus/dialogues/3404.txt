Seen any good Horror movies lately?
I have seen a few classic ones lately.
Like which ones?
The Exorcist.
Wow, that one is scary right?
Very, lots of things to make you jump.
Would you say it is a good one?
I think it is one of the best. The Priest is in a shape the whole movie.
Does the demon girl kill any one?
Oh, you will have to wait and see. Just wait until you see her and her head turn!
