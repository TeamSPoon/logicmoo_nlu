How about that Phillies bullpen?
It might be the worst baseball has ever seen!
They just dont have one guy that can get anyone out.
Feel for the manager, its like the wheel of death
They literally do not have one dependable arm.
Bullpens are hard to staff
Its a hit or miss part of the team
I mean who do you think could do that job?
Staff a pen?
No throw a seamless inning.
In their pen, Neshek?
Maybe but hes had issues
I dont think theyve thrown him into the fire.
They tried one time in the 8th and he didnt do bad.
Again, its tough to think what you could do with that kind of arm.
I think youll see the team not address the needs ever.
Vince Velasquez could be their new closer soon
I dont think so, dont take away from the rotation to supplement your pen.
Well bad teams dont need good arms back there.
Yeah thats why I think theyll do it piece meal for the rest of the year.
