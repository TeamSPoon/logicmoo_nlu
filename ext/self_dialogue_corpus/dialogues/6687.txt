The Haunted Mansion was on HBO today.
Oh man, what did you think?
It's hard to imagine Disney screwing it up more.
I know right?  Why did they take all the fun out of it?
It wasn't that it wasn't fun, I just thought it should have been darker.
You mean like super-creepy?
Yeah, kind of like they should have made it PG-13 and not as campy.
I could see that.
I hope they remake it that way and make it tons better.
I would pay $10 in a theater to see it for sure.
