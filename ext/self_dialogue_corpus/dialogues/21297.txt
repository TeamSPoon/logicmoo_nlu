Do you like Disney movies? I'm a huge Disney fan.
I absolutely LOVE Disney movies!
My favorites are, "Cinderella", "Tangled", "Toy Story" 1-3, and "Sleeping Beauty".
I love the "Toy Story" movies. I wasn't crazy about the second one. The third is the best in my opinion.
I liked them all. The third was great though. I thought it was suspenseful at some parts, too.
It definitely was. Especially when the toys were trying to sneak out of the daycare.
That Lottso Huggin' Bear character was crazy.
He was. I always wondered if his character was too scary for kids.
The classic Disney movies are the best to me, they never get old.
They are good. A lot of them stayed true to the written fairytales.
"Alice in Wonderland" is by far one of the greatest Disney movies ever made.
Agreed. The writers did an incredible job with that. The colors and even the graphics for that time period were excellent.
I never watched the real-life adaptations of "Alice in Wonderland". You know, with Johnny Depp?
I didn't get into those either. I thought it looked crazy and confusing. But Johnny Depp is an amazing actor.
He is. I liked him in "What's Eating Gilbert Grape" and "Edward Scissorhands".
"Edward Scissorhands" was epic!
Who is your favorite movie actress?
I have a lot of favorites. Drew Barrymore, Kevin James, Julia Stiles, Mark Wahlberg, Reese Witherspoon, etc.
Reese Witherspoon and Mark Wahlberg were great in the movie, "Fear"
They were, but I wasn't a fan of that movie. It was a little too cheesy for me.
