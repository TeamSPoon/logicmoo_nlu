I can't stop listening to lady GAGA!!
Haha, her songs always get stuck in my head.
I know, me too. I swear I've been walking around humming bad romance for like five years.
Have you listened to Eh, Eh?
Yeah, I think so.
It's older, from her first album.
Yeah, I've seen the music video. Set in little italy right?
Yeah that's the one. I freaking love that song so much. I can't believe it wasn't played more.
I know it seems like the radio only picks 2-3 songs off every album to play and forgets the rest.
Yeah, it's a shame. It's such a good song!
