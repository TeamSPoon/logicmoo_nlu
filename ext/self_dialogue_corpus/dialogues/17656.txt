do you like the black parade?
the album by my chemical romance
their third album
what song was on it? im bad at remembering albums
dead, mama, teenagers
and it had that song about a parade?
yeah, thats the title track basically
that album was so good
probably my favorite album by them
welcome to the black parade was such an epic anthem
and it was emotional and dark too
mama was even better
that song is about war
yes and its super melodic
it had so many changes in it. it was beautiful
they made a classic with that album
hopefully people remember it in 10 years
i am sure they will
that album is important
a sign of the times kinda
