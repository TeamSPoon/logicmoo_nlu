Are you looking forward to the next Star Wars movie?
You bet! I thought Force Awakens was a fantastic start to the new trilogy.
It was much better than the movies from Episodes 1-3.
Indeed. I don't think they were that bad, but they just seemed to be lacking.
Yeah, they did tell a story that you kind of wanted from a Star Wars movie, but most of the characters seemed flat.
I think they tried a bit too hard, though Natalie Portman was good as Queen Amadala
She was fantastic, Rey from Force Awakens kind of reminds me of her a bit.
They really do look similar.
I'm definitely looking forward to Luke Skywalker and Rey's interactions in the next film.
I definitely can't wait for it to come out!
