Do you follow the NFL at all?
Yeah, definitely. I love football.
What's your favorite team?
I would have to say the Patriots, but I have a few that I like.
Really? I don't like the Patriots at all.
What's your favorite team, then?
I'm a huge fan of the Bears.
That's cool. The Bears might actually do well next year.
I think so too. I'm excited for the changes they've made.
It will definitely be interesting to see. I still think Tom Brady has them beat, though.
I expected you'd say that. Do you think he really played a part in the deflated football scandal?
I'm really not sure how I feel about that situation.
I think he at least had knowledge that the balls were deflated during that game.
Yeah, I just think it's blown out of proportion.
That's true. It seemed like a really big deal for a deflated football.
Definitely. No one can say that Tom Brady's success is solely due to cheating.
I'll agree with you there. He's got talent and that's easy to see.
The last Super Bowl was a pure showcase of his ability to perform under pressure.
That was the biggest comeback I have ever seen.
I couldn't believe my eyes. They did exactly what they had to in order to win.
