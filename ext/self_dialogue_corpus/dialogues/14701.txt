Are you excited for the Spurs Warriors playoff matchup?
Yeah, when is the first game.
They play this Sunday May 14th at 3:30 pm.
That should be a great series.
Do you know if Leonard is back from his injury? He didnt play the end of the Rockets series.
Thats right. Yeah I actually read on ESPN that he will be ready to go for game one against the warriors.
Where are they playing the first game?
The Warriors have the better record so they will be in Oakland for Game 1.
Who is playing in the Eastern Conference Finals?
Well definetly the Cavaliers, but the Wizards and Celtics are still playing their series.
Who do you think will win?
I hope the Wizards will win, but I think the Celtics are going to win.
Yeah, Isiah Thomas is a great player and I dont think Wall and Beal can match up against the Celtics well.
Yeah, who knows though the Wizards did just play a great game to send it back to Boston.
I think the Finals will be Cleveland and the Warriors. What about you?
Well definetly Cleveland, I cant see another team beating them in the East.
What about the Warriors?
I do not know the Spurs are playing great and just defeated the Rockets who were playing great.
Yeah thats true but do you really think they can beat Thompson, Curry, Green at thier best?
No, but you dont know if they will play that well this series. It will be a great series.
