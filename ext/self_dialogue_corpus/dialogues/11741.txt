Can you help me find a good George Harrison song in The Beatles?
Yes. Here Comes the Sun
That's a good one
While My Guitar Gently Weeps is another great one.
I will listen to those.
He is an underrated Beatle.
I agree. He did not get the same attention the others did.
He has a great voice.
I agree. He makes the Beatles great.
I found another song he sings! Long, Long, Long.
