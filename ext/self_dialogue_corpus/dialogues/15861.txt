What do you think of the Beatles?
I can take them or leave them.
Are you serious? They're the greatest band ever.
Well, I think that's going a bit too far.
They totally changed the music landscape
Why do you say that?
They created the British invasion
Well just for young women in the U.S.
They created pop music
I think pop music was around much before they arrived.
They transformed their music through the years
Yes, I'll give you that. Drugs can do a lot to people.
Do you not like any of their songs?
Well, I guess I like I Wanna Hold Your Hand.
Really? That one is so old.
Yeah, but it still holds up.
What about some of their more refined work like I Am The Walrus
Umm, that one was clearly made up while they were high.
No way, it's got depth dude.
I think you have issues.
