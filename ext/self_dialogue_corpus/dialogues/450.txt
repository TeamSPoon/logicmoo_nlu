I feel bad for Peter Craws.
Is he ok?
He just sustained a season ending injury!
On no.
He already had a kneecap injury.
Did it require surgery?
Yes, two surgeries.
But he came back?
Yes, he healed very quickly.
But what happened next?
He just tore his ACL.
Man, that's tough.
I don't think he'll heal as quickly.
ACL injuries don't heal fast.
Right.
So, he's out for the season?
Yes, unfortunately.
I hope the best for him.
Me too.
Hopefully next season, he'll be back.
