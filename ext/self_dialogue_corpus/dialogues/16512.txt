It's been a great year for music so far, don't you think?
I agree, so many of my favorite artists have released new songs!
Who are some of your favorites?
Well, I like Fleet Foxes a lot.
Me too! They had a long hiatus so it's great to hear them with new material.
"Third of May" is as good as their best stuff on their earlier albums, in my opinion.
It's a great song, and so is the follow-up teaser track, "Fool's Errand".
They have a pretty flawless record since they came out, as far as I'm concerned.
Another band that's coming back and I'm excited about is The National.
Yeah, their new song is a departure for them, in a good way.
The vocals are a giveaway that it's The National, but I'm really digging the faster beat on the new track.
Speaking of comebacks, and faster beats, what about LCD Soundsystem?
I'm a huge fan of theirs, I saw them on Saturday Night Live a couple weeks ago.
I missed it, but I've heard both new songs and based on that I'm sure I'll be buying the new album when it drops.
I haven't seen them in concert but I'm hoping to get a chance when they come around here.
I almost forgot, one of my absolute favorites lately, The War on Drugs.
Their last album was so good! The new song, "Thinking of a Place", is proof that it was no fluke.
It's amazing that it's 11 minutes long and I still wanted more!
There are so many other acts showing up with new material too, like Grizzly Bear, Phoenix, and Haim.
It's a great summer for indie, that's for sure!
