I want to go see Queen this summer.
Are they touring?
Yes and they're in Philadelphia.
Do you really want to see Queen or Adam Lambert?
That's funny, but actually both.
Queen had so many memorable songs.
We Will Rock You was associated with so many things when we were young.
Yes it was.
Adam Lambert is a great front man for them.
He is, he has an excellent voice.
