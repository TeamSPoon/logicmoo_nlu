Do you like Elton John?
He is one of the best artists ever
Is he still around?
Yes
What song do you like of his?
Little Jeannie
That's a good one
Yeah and there are plenty more
Ever heard Tiny Dancer?
Yes
That might be his best one
I wish I could have seen him live
He is very good live
I remember when he wore the duck costume live
I would have loved to be there.
He has so many classics
I love Philadelphia Freedom
Me too. That is a great song
I have all of his albums
Let's listen to one!
