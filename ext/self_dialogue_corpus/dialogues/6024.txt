What did you think of Alice in Wonderland?
The one with Johnny Depp?
No, the Disney animation.
I have not seen that in a long time.
It was one of the first sort of book into a cartoon.
I thought all Disney movies were based on books and old fairy tales.
The first sort of more contemporary one.
I guess the book was not that old when the film was made.
Walt Disney loved the idea of turning those dark fairy tales into light movies.
Yeah, but some like Bambi are not all that light. When his mom is shot!
