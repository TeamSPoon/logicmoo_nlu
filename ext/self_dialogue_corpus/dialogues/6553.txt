I love the song "How Far I'll Go" from Moana.
Oh, I've heard the song before. It's sung by Alessia Cara?
In the Moana it's sung by Auli'i Cravalho.
What Moana about?
It's about a Polynesian girl who is chosen by the ocean itself to reunite a mystical relic with a goddess.
Is there anyone famous in the movie?
Yeah, Dwayne "the Rock" Johnson plays Maui a Demi-god that helps Moana save her island from dying.
Cool. Is it a typical "the heroine falls in love and lives happily ever after" story?
No way! It's about a strong independent girl who risks her life to save her people.
That's great! I hate it when Disney makes movies about a girl's happiness is dependent on romance.
