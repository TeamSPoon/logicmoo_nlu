How do you feel about rap music?
I really like some of it, but I like classic rap music than the newer rap music.
Who is your favorite rap artist or rap group?
There are so many good ones, but I love The Sugarhill Gang.
Wow! That's some old school rap! I love their song called Rapper's Delight.
Yeah, I like that one too! Who do you like as far as rap goes?
I love the group called Arrested Development. They were big in the 1990's.
I remember them, I loved the song called Mister Wendal.
Yes, I loved that song too! They were a great group.
I wonder where they are now.
