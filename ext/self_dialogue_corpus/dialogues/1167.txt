So I heard that you're a bit of a trivia buff.
I am!
What's your best subject?
I'm pretty good at knowing things about the NFL.
That's cool. What's your favorite fact?
Well, the Green Bay Packers won the first ever Super Bowl.
Oh, wow, I didn't know that! What year was that in?
It was in 1967.
Hey, my mom was born that year.
Cool.
Do you have a second favorite fact?
How about this; in '96, the Cleveland Browns moved to Baltimore to become the Baltimore Ravens.
That's pretty interesting. I actually know a similar fact.
What's that?
In '84 the Baltimore Colts moved to Indianapolis and became the Indianapolis Colts.
Yup!
Well, I think it's neat that you know so much about NFL stuff.
I don't know that much, just random facts, really.
It's still pretty neat.
Thanks!
