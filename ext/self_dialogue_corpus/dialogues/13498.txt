Which movie did you like better, "The Force Awakens" or "The Last Jedi"
Oh, they were both good, but I think that "The Last Jedi" is really my favorite.
Oh, why is that?
Because it really explains the back story well, but does it in broad strokes
What do you mean by broad strokes?
Well, for example, if you take the two not-so-good Star Wars flicks, you know, the prequels with Jar-Jar Binks
Oh yes, those were awful!
Well, one of the reasons they were awful (besides some horrible dialogue and insipid acting) was that they felt the need to explain everything to you.
Don't you want to know what actually happens?
Yes, but not down to the tiniest detail.  I want to be able to use my imagination to fill in some stuff.  Those movies didn't let you.  "The Last Jedi", along with good actors (nobody's cousin got a job on this one) had a great story line.
