Have you seen Finding Dory?
Yes, I took my kids to see it last week.
Did you like it?
I loved it! I think that it was as good as Finding Nemo. Maybe better.
That is a very bold assessment. Finding Nemo is a classic.
Well, the story was very sweet and heart warming. Ellen as Dory is the best thing in the world.
I had heard that from other friends. Is it a tear jerker?
Yes, but more over it was very funny.
Would you recommend Finding Dory for me then?
Yes. I would go so far as to say buying the bluray is worth the cost.
