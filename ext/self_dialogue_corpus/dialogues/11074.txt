Did you see that the Carolina Hurricanes traded for Scott Darling a couple of weeks ago?
Yeah I think it's because of Chicago's cap problems.
Probably, Carolina signed him to an extension too. They're hoping he can start for them.
How much was that deal?
It's a $4.15 million cap hit each year for the next 5 years.
That's a pretty big deal. Don't they already have some goalies?
They do have Cam Ward and Eddie Lack already.
Those guys the past couple of years haven't been amazing. I guess it makes sense.
And don't forget that the expansion draft is looming.
Very true. They might be hoping Vegas takes one.
Yep, and the other guy can just back up Darling.
Well I guess it might not be that black and white. Lack did end the season well.
You're not wrong, but goalies get hot a lot of the time too. He might not keep it up.
I guess we'll see. If their goaltending improves they could really make the playoffs.
Definitely helps their chances. But they might need some offense too.
Maybe they could trade some of their defense to improve up front? They're kind of stacked there.
There are some names out there on the trade market this year like Duchene and maybe Drouin.
Either one of those guys could work. And those teams would want young dmen back too.
I guess we'll see. Next year should be really interesting for them in any case.
For sure. I'm looking forward to it.
