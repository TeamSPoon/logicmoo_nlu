What is your favorite football team?
In the NFL?
Yes.
I am a fan of the Denver Broncos.
They are a good team.
I really liked watching when Manning was playing there.
He was fun to watch.
He was fun to watch with the Colts as well.
I bet it was nice having him play for your favorite team.
It was.
Is Siemian the quarterback now?
He is.  I don't know how good he will be.
It is hard to compare with Peyton.
It is.  They have other good talent.
They are a good team all around.
I hope they can go all the way this year.
They have the team to do it.
As long as they can avoid injury.
That is true, it can ruin any good team.
Yes it can.
