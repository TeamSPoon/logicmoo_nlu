There's certain music or songs that you listen to and afterwards you feel like you commited a sin.
Ha ha ha .Like who?
Well. Rihanna. I really like her I mean I can really jam to the music but afterwards I feel so dirty
Really. I didn't know a song had that kind of power
Well it depends on the artist and the lyrics I guess
Well personally I don't listen to Rihanna but she's not really known for being classy
Meaning why am I listening to her?
Well yeah I mean your not really the type to listen to all that cursing and stuff
Well sometimes its by accident, like you go out somewhere and music by her is playing
So then you go home and you listen to her songs on your own time
Exactly this is how you get hooked on these things
They play songs that you might not normally listen to.
Then you listen to a few more of the songs and the lyrics get bad
Yes. And thats when you start to feel the dirtiness
Exactly. Then I start to feel like why am I listening to Rihanna,  when her songs just make me feel bad?
Well it seems like you've been suckered into it.
Yeah I mean her earlier songs from the start of her career weren't too bad
They were innocent enough, in that song called 'Umbrella' she actually sounds like she wants to be a friend
Yeah and there's no cussing in that one either
I guess you need to think twice before you listen to Rihanna's music
