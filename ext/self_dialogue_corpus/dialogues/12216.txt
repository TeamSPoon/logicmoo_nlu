Who is your favorite Star Wars character?
Hmm...my favorite Star Wars character would have to be Obi Wan Kenobi.
Why so?  There are plenty of other characters.  What makes him your favorite?
I feel like he is morally correct and thinks through his actions compared to others.  Plus, he uses a blue lightsaber.
Blue lightsaber?  What makes it better than the other colors?
It's not more powerful...I just prefer the color blue.
So, what about Rey?  She uses a blue lightsaber.
Rey is not my favorite.  She's a good character though.  Who is your favorite character?
I like Kylo Ren.  His cross-guard lightsaber is actually really cool.
I told you...lightsabers do have something to do with your favorite Star Wars characters.
