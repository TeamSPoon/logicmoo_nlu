Who is the greatest defensive player in the league?
I think that JJ Watt definitely has a claim to that spot.
It's a shame, though, because his teams haven't been great recently.
Yes, hopefully the Texans will be solid this year.
Seems like they are bad every year.
They had a decent run when they had Arian Foster.
I am sad that Foster has since retired.
I know, he used to be so great.
The problem is that running backs have short lifespans.
Unfortunately, that is the reality in the NFL.
I really miss Calvin Johnson.
Me too, he was the best.
Megatron - as they say - was probably my favorite receiver.
Mine too, he had such grace on the field.
What do you think of Andre Johnson?
The man is great, but unfortunately just retired.
Yes, him and Fitzgerald were great for so long.
Hopefully Fitz won't retire for a while.
I know! I love him so much.
As a Cardinals fan, I do, too.
