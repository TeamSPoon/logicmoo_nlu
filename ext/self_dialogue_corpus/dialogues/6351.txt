So I heard something yesterday, not sure if it's true.
Okay, explain more.
They are apparently remaking Peter Pan.
But they've remade that film tons of times already!
I know, but this one is actually being done by Disney.
Live-action or animation?
Live-action.  It will be totally different from the other recent Peter Pan movies.
Wow.  They are really re-doing everything, aren't they?
Well, the movies are popular and make tons of money.
I guess that's my answer as to why!
