I can't wait for the new Disney film, Coco.
I've never heard of it; when does it come out?
It looks great and it comes out in November.
Are there even trailers out for it yet?
I saw a couple on YouTube and it's about a boy in Mexico learning about his family's history.
That could be interesting, but maybe too deep for children.
There will be plenty of music and the animation is amazing!
As long as my kids can see it then it'll be good, they really really love movies with music.
The main theme of this movie will be around music and family.
Then we'll have to go see it when it comes out in November.
