When did you start to like the Beatles? I was six.
I was older then that, around eight.
It was through my brothers
My girlfriend was nuts about them. All we'd listened to when at her house.
The question that everyone asks - who is you favorite? Mine is Paul.
My favorite changed. First it was Paul then George.
George? John is usually the one that people change to.
When George came into his own, was when I started.
Have you seen the band or any of them in concert? I've seen Ringo and His All Starr band and they were great.
No. I surpose I still can, can't I?
