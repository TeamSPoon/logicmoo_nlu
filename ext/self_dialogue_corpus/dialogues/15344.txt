Miley Cyrus is back on the billboards chart!
What?  I haven't heard anything of her in a while.
Yep, she is number 25 with Malibu.
How long has she been on the chart?
This is her sixth week on the billboard chart, and she is going up.
I heard the song , but I have not seen the video yet.
Yes, her videos can be a bit crazy!
I read somewhere it could have references to her latest lover Liam Hemsworth.
Probably, but then who knows.  Some of them date many times in a year different people.
You are right! What album did she release lately?
I think the latest one was Miley Cyrus & Her Dead Petz album.
Such a strange name for an album!
Bangerz was in 2013, and then Breakout was in 2008.
Can't Be Tamed was an album that I enjoyed, but that was when she was quite young.
Yes, I think that was her coming out stage, of little girl music etc.
People expected her to be a certain way all the time.
Yes from her tv work!
It was quite a shock when she let everyone know she was more into pop rock and raunchier music.
I like her alot, but she has more music to play yet.
She will be around for a while I am sure.
