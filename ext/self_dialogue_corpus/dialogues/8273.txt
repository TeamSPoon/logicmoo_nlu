I dont think I can stand another summer of pop hits.
Whats wrong, dont like sick beats?
Are you serious right now?
Not really, most pop music hurts my ears too.
The weird south american club influences and cholo beats are just too much.
Sia puts out some decent stuff though.
Yeah but good tracks are few and far between these days.
I understand, its hard to stay sane through most of what I hear on the radio.
We need a cleanse.
I'd prefer some earplugs.
