Do you like lady gaga?
I feel like her music is good but she doesnt need the gimmic.
what do you mean?
her outfits!
oh like her meat dress and all her weird things?
yes. she is talented enough.
well, it certainly helps. music is so oversaturated.
well, she is huge now so she doesnt need to do that.
to be honest, she hardly does it now.
oh well, that is good.
