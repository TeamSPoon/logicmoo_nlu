I think that the romance in Lady and the Tramp is the best Disney love story of all time.
You mean the best Disney relationship is between two dogs?
Yes! The way they give each other puppy dog eyes. It kills me.
They are awfully charming.
And the way they share that meal. It just touches my heart.
A romantic dinner will do that to a person.
Lady is so demure. And then she embraces the Tramp with all of his unruliness.
It's a special kind of unconditional love.
We should all aspire to find the Lady to our Tramp.
Or the Tramp to our Lady.
