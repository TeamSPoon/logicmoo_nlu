Hey, have you seen the most recent Pirates of the Caribbean movie.
Not yet, but I want too.
What to hear some highlights but not to many spoilers.
Sure, what can you tell me?
Well, Henry, WIll's son, is trying to free Will from the curse of the Flying Dutchman.
The whole 10 years at sea, one day shore thing?
Yep, and that leads him to a down on his luck Jack and Karina Smythe, a young woman who holds the secret to finding the solution.
But I take it there's a catch?
Yep, Jack still hasn't freed the Pearl from the bottle and Karina is too be hung as a witch.
Not a good situation to be in.
Yes, and too top it off, Jack gave away the compass for booze.
The compass that points toward wahtever you want most?
Yep, and he shouldn't have done that.
Why?
Because selling the compass for any reason is seen as betraying it and that curses the betrayer by bringing his greates fear to life.
Which for Jack is?
Captain Salazar, a dead Spanish Navy pirate hunter Jack sent to his grave early in his career. The compass frees him and his ghostly crew from the Devil's Triangle.
I take it they want Jack?
Yep, Salazar and crerw want him dead for killing them all those years ago.
Definitely sounds like I will makeing time to see this one soon.
