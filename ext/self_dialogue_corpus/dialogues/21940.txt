Do you like Disney movies?
Yes, I love them. I grew up watching them so they are a huge part of my childhood.
Do you have a favorite?
That's like asking someone if they have a favorite child!  I guess if I had to pick, maybe the Lion King.
That is such a great movie.
It really is. And the music was great.
Aren't they creating a live action version of it.
That's what I hear. That seems to be the new thing lately.
I know. Alice in Wonderland, Cinderella, the Snow White Movies, and most recently Beauty and the Beast.
I know and for as much as I love Disney, can you believe I've only see Alice.
Really? You didn't see any of the others?
No. I want to, but unfortunately my husband isn't into Disney.
Well they are worth watching for sure. He may even like them.
That's doubtful, but I can try.
I'd recommend it. The effects are so good and it is nice to hear the music again.
I'm sure. What is your favorite Disney movie?
I'd have to say the Little Mermaid. I always loved that one.
That was a good one. There is a mermaid live action movie coming out too, but I don't think it is Disney.
How is that possible?
Because the Little Mermaid is a fairy tale in the public domain, not just a Disney movie.
