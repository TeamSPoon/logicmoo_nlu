Jack Reacher, did you like it?
Yea, I did a lot
I love Tom Cruise in it.
I thought I read somewhere that Dwayen Johnson was looking to play the role
That would be a bit weird if he did
Yea, it was a spy movie kinda, and The Rock is kinda big for that type of role
I do find Dwyane to be a good actor though
Yea, he is very dedicated to his craft.
Who do you think is better, Dwyane  or Tom Cruise?
I gotta go with Tom Cruise
Why is that?
I think he just has more experience with movies
The rock was in a lot of wrestling shows
Yea, but I dont think it translates to the big screen.
I do like movies that Tom Cruise has been in
Yupp, my favorite is probably Mission Impossible
Spy movies are hard to mess up
It's true, they are very complex
They could probably go on and on forever with Mission Impossible movies
I would watch them all.
