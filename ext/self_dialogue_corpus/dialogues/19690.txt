I believe he will be just fine.  So many people really did enjoy his music.

Yes he is.  What do you think of Blake Shelton?
Blake has such a fun personality.  I bet he would be a lot of fun to hang out with.
What do you think of him as a coach on The Voice?
He is my favorite coach because he truly does coach his people and many go into the music industry.
He is my favorite too.
Have you ever seen Blake in concert?
I did see him at Country Thunder last year in Arizona.  He is so good.
What do you think of the relationship Blake and Gwen have started?
I actually think they make a great couple.  What makes it work is they have different interest that gives them something to appreciate when together.
Do you like Tim Magraw?
I do like his music a lot. What a great musician.
What is your favorite song by him?
I cannot remember the name of it but is the one about the father and the son.
I cannot remember the name of that song either now.  It is such a great song though.
It was the number one song of the year during the year when it came out.
