Who shot first: Greedo or Han?
Obviously, Han shot first, no matter what George Lucas says.
I agree. What else do you think George Lucas screwed up?
I think there is too much added stuff in the Mos Eisley scenes in the redone movies.
That's true. I like the more gritty effect of the originals.
Yeah, another thing I liked from the early versions was the painted backgrounds.
Did they replace these with computer generated imagery?
I don't know for sure, but they probably did.
The Bespin Cloud City backgrounds were pretty cool, even if they looked like paintings.
Definitely. I'd like to live in Bespin Cloud City.
