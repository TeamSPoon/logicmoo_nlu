What do you think about all the recent new rules protecting quarterbacks in the NFL?
I hate them. It's changing the integrity of the game too much.
Why would you say that? All they are doing is protecting a vulnerable position player.
They're not protecting the quarterback, they're babying him and giving him an unfair advantage.
Oh come on, why would they want to give an unfair advantage to quarterbacks?
It's pretty obvious, I think.  They NFL likes high-scoring games and high-scoring quarterbacks.
So you're saying they do it to improve ratings because fans want to see games that end 38-30?
That's exactly what I'm saying. It's sad.
Ok then, how are the rules giving advantages to quarterbacks?
For one thing, a defensive lineman can no longer rush at the quarterback at full speed for fear he will get a personal foul and maybe even get fined and thrown out of the game.
But that still happens. How do these rules prevent that?
You need to see an interview with Deacon Jones. He'll set you straight.
You mean the guy who played for the Rams? Wasn't he known as a dirty player?
He was a tough player. Of course the guys on the losing end of his rough play are going to call it dirty.
Well, what does he say about all this?
He says we're molly-coddling the quarterbacks. He says they might as well skirts back there because no one is allowed to hit them any more and because of that they have free reign to do anything they want.
So what's wrong with that? Why should they get hit so hard?
Because it's part of the game and football is about intimidation and heart as much as it is about scoring. If you punish an opponent enough, they get scared and they give up.
Why not just make it about who is the better player?
Playing rough IS about who is the better overall player, because it takes into account how much drive and determination you have. If you can take a beating and keep on coming, you are a champion and THAT is what football should be about.
