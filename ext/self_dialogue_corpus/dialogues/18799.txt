Are you a Michael Jackson fan?
Am I? He's my favorite artist of all time.
Mine too! What's your favorite song by him?
Oh that's easy. Human Nature is a classic.
Yes it is but my favorite is Lady in my Life.
That's such a sweet song, it really showed his sexy side.
Did you watch that Martin Bashear special on Michael from a few years back.
Yes and I hated it just like any true Michael Jackson fan.
It was horrible the way they did him. I was mortified.
Well we still have his music and we know what a sweet soul he really was.
Did you see the behind the scenes concert movie for This is It?
Yes it was going to be his last tour but he didn't make it.
It was a great movie, and it looked like he was working on some new dance movies.
I remember thinking that too. I got my kids into Michael Jackson.
Oh really? Do they have any of the songs memorized?
Well my daughter knows all of Butterflies along with a few others.
That's so cute. I love his song Strange in Moscow.
He came out with a song called Heaven Can Wait that I didn't hear until years later.
That was a really nice and updated song from him.
I love that song along with Rock With You. That's another sweet classic.
