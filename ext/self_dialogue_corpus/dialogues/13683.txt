What did you think about Lady Gaga's concert last night?
It was better than I thought it would be. I must admit that I had some reservations before going to the concert.
What do you mean? You never told me you had any reservations!
Well, you know how theatrical she can be.
That is true which is why I knew she would give a great concert!
I figured the concert would be more of a production rather than her singing.
I know what you mean. Lady Gaga is quite a character.
Well, after going to her concert, I can say that I love everything about her character!
I agree. I think her character makes her unique from other musical artists.
Especially with the lack of talent from most musical artists today!
