You know who used to be super popular that you don't think about anymore?
Who is that?
Lil Jon. He was wild.
Yes I remember him! He always worse sunglasses.
Yep. I think it was actually Lil Jon and the Eastside Boyz.
Yes they rapped that one song "Get Low". That used to be the jam.
I would play that song in my friend's dorm room and we'd dance to it.
Those were fun times.
That's the kind of music you listened to if you wanted to get hyped up.
Yep, fun times!
