Do you ever listen to house music?
I enjoy house, but I don't know much about it.
There's so much new house music coming out, it's hard to keep up with.
Do you have any artists you would reccomend?
There are a lot of new and exciting artists right now. Oliver Heldens is really good.
I have heard his name before.
He has a song called "I Don't Wanna Go Home". It's really good.
I will give it a listen.
Another good one is Tiesto.
I've definitely heard of Tiesto. He's really popular.
He has a song with Oliver Heldens called "The Right Song" and it's great, too.
The only artist in that genre that I'm really familiar with is Martin Garrix.
Martin Garrix is so young. It's crazy how talented he is.
I really like his song called "Animals".
That song has over a billion plays on Youtube.
I hear it being played everywhere. It doesn't surprise me.
If you like him, you might like Calvin Harris.
Isn't he the one who dated Taylor Swift?
Yes, his song "This Is What You Came For" with Rihanna is beautiful.
I love Rihanna's voice. I will add it to my playlist.
