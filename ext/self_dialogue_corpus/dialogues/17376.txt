Have you ever heard the song Piano Man?
I don't believe so.
It is a great song about musician in a bar, has a great tune and tells a good story.
That sounds interesting.
It is. On that note, It is by Billy Joel and a lot of his stuff is really good.
Oh really?
I like nearly everything by him.
Like what?
I tend to count River of Dreams and Longest Time among my favorites
I don't think I have heard of them.
You probably have heard the songs at least, they get used in movies and commercials sometimes.
Oh, possible.
They are really nice songs. Have a lot of vocal harmony and a good sound.
I might have to give them a listen.
I enjoy them, and the rest of his songs.
Maybe I will too.
I bet you will. You May Be Right is another fun song of his.
Oh? What is it about.
It is about a guy who may or may not be slightly crazy and how he is trying to woo a girl. It tells a story like a lot of his music.
Thanks for the recommendations, I will look into him.
