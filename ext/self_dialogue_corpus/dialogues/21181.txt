It like cult classic films.
Me too. Like Rocky Horror, right?
Yeah, sure. Or like Reefer Madness, even though that's sort of different.
Oh, oh, or Shock Treatment. That was an attempt to try to cash in on the cult success of Rocky Horror, but it didn't.
Huh, I guess that makes it a real cult classic film then.
A cult-classic even among cult-classics.
Heavy Metal is a good cult-classic too, though more mainstream.
Well, if we're talking animation then I'd throw Akira in, too. But it's definitely mainstream now.
I'd suggest Fritz the Cat, but I guess it's sort of well known, too.
Yeah, but the sequel was a big failure, so it might count.
You know, Attack of the Killer Tomatoes was made to be a cult film from the start.
Really? What's the point in that?
That was just the kind of movie they wanted to make. They didn't make it that way for financial reasons.
It must've made some sort of impression though, I mean, they even made video games of it like ten or fifteen years later.
Oh yeah, it's definitely fondly, and not so fondly remembered now.
For the most part, only well liked cult-films are remembered. You never hear about the ones that didn't real badly and forgotten.
You mean like your Shock Treatment example? But you remember it.
I'm one of the few. Most people don't remember the real cult, cult-classics.
Most people don't remember art-house films either.
Truthfully, I don't think there's much of a difference between the two; Art-house or cult-classics. Often they're both weird for the sake of weird.
