Have you heard the Carly Rae Jepsen song, Cut to the Feeling?
No I haven't. I don't really love Carly Rae Jepsen.
Why not?
Well, that one song got so played out it just started to drive me crazy.
Which song? Call Me Maybe?
Yeah, that one. It was overplayed.
It did go pretty viral with the lip-synching videos and everything. But still, I like her music.
What's the new song again?
It's called Cut to the Feeling. It's my summer jam.
Ok. I don't know.
I think she has some really interesting 80's influences in her music. It just makes me happy when I listen to it.
Were'nt the 80's kind of cheesy?
Maybe. But that doens't mean they weren't fun.
I guess I just like more chill music. Like something you would listen to at a coffee shop.
That's fair. I like listening to music I can dance to.
I don't dance. It makes me look like a frog slipping on an icy lake while trying to do yoga.
That is hilarious! I'm sure it's not all that bad.
No, it really is.
I think you should try to listen to some dance music and have a good time. Even just alone in your house.
I might try that, but I hope I don't hurt myself!
