Who do you think is the greatest running back in NFL history?
Since I've been watching, probably either Barry Sanders or Emmitt Smith.
They were both pretty great, had a different style.
I always thought Emmitt Smith would run through tackles, but Barry Sanders was very elusive, and could run around defenders.
Marshawn Lynch was a lot like both of them, but he seemed to have a ton of power.
Did you hear that Marshawn Lynch came out of retirement?
Yeah, I heard that he's going to play for Oakland.
If he still at the top of his game, the Raiders could win a lot of games next season.
Yeah, with Derek Carr and Amari Cooper they could score a lot of points.
I think Amari Cooper is going to go down as one of the greatest receivers ever.
Maybe, if he can keep playing with good quarterbacks. I think it helped Jerry Rice that he played with Joe Montana and Steve Young.
Do you think Jerry Rice was the best receiver ever?
Yeah, the only one that comes close in my mind was Calvin Johnson.
I think Randy Moss and Terrell Owens were two of the best ever.
I think they could've been, they just didn't seem to have the same work ethic as someone like Jerry Rice.
Work ethic is always pretty important, that's why I like Larry Fitzgerald.
Larry Fitzgerald is one of my favorites as well. He's a great player, and seems to be a good guy all around.
I imagine Larry Fitzgerald is going to retire soon. Hopefully he and Carson Palmer can have one more good season.
Carson Palmer has been playing NFL football for 15 seasons, he's running out of time.
He could have a few more good seasons if he can stay healthy. Just look at Tom Brady.
