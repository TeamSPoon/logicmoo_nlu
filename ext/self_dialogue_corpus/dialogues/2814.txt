What do you think of the Raiders move to Las Vegas?
I think that stinks.
I heard the Raiders players will save big on taxes because of this deal.
Really?
Yes, Nevada has no income taxes.
So they are doing it for money.
The Raiders can offer players lower contracts they will save millions in taxes.
What does Derek Carr earn?
He has a 125 million contract.
Wow that is nuts.
So by moving Carr will save over 8 million in taxes compared to California.
Who wants to play out there then?
I guess the players love the move.
The fans are the only ones who suffer from this move.
It is only a business.
The ownership must be getting some financial benefit from the move then.
The Raiders can now sign other stars like Khalil Mack to deals.
Makes sense for them all around
I liked the Oakland Coliseum.
That's how it goes.
