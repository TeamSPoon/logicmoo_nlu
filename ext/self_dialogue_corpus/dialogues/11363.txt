What Beatles song do you think is the most overrated?
Hmm. Let me look at their compilation 1, which is made up of all their number one hits.
That's a good idea. The songs are clearly held in high esteem by the public if they were number one hits.
Exactly, these songs shot to the top of the charts.
I'm looking now and "Love is All You Need" is probably the song I find most overrated.
Why's that?
I know the end gets experimental, but to me it's a little too repetitive and a little too lovey dovey.
Well, I'm still looking at this list. I disagree about "Love is All You Need."
Well, what will it be then?
I'm going to go with "Eight Days a Week." I love their early stuff, but this track just doesn't connect with me.
