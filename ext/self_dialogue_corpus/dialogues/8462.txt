What do you think of Lady Gaga?
Actually I was never a fan of most of her music, but I loved her on American Horror Story.
Did she do a good job acting?
I think she did, but maybe she just matched her character.
What do you mean by that?
Well, I think she's a bit odd and her character was odd, so maybe it wasn't a stretch.
Oh, well are there any songs of hers that you do like?
I really liked You and I.  I loved it and I was surprised when I found out it was her.
Yeah, it shows she can really sing.
Yeah, she can.  She's just a bit peculiar.
