Which artist is your favorite rapper?
I don't know that I can choose just one, but I'd say that I like 90's hip-hop best.
Like Tribe Called Quest and Naughty by Nature?
Exactly.  I do like some of the more serious rap as well, though.
Anyone in particular that I should consider?
Wu-Tang Clan, of course, Dr. Dre, Jay Z and Nas are all favorites for more hardcore rap.
I see you're more of an East Coast fan than West Coast, would you agree?
Yeah, I'd agree I skew East Coast.  Mostly, I like good beats and I like when people have fun or are sincere and lyrical.
So do you like the new hip-hop artists that are more focused on social and political issues rather than gangster issues?
Like Drake, Kendrick Lamar, and J. Cole?  Yeah, those guys are all great too and they kind of throw back to the 90's.
