Nightmare Before Christmas is one of the best Disney movies
I love when Tim Burton teams up with Disney
right? they always do good things!
i love seeing what he comes up with in his new, creepy world
jack and sally are weirdly relationship goals
they are! i love their little song at the end
it's the best halloween movie, and it doubles as a christmas movie! does it get any better?
it doesn't.
oogie boogie's song is the best song from the whole flick, though
villains always steal the spotlight
