Who do wish you could see in concert?
Madonna , I love her and yet never seen her live.
I think she is getting pretty old.
Do you just mean her age or her music?
Both in a way. I mean she is dated.
She may be dated, but she has no expiration.
hahaha pretty funny. I will give it to you.
I will say that I do think some of her earlier tours may have been her peak.
Ya, I think even ten years ago you would have gotten a much better performance,
Well never seeing her live I can not say. But that may be true.
I have never seen her live myself. so who knows.
I wish I could have seen her girlie tour.
That was a good one from reputation.
Did you know carrie anne anuba wa sone of her dancers on that tour?
The judge from dancing with the stars?
Yes. She actually slid down some velvet rope or cloth in a thong.
I would really have liked to see that. I liked carrie anne.
Me too. But Madonna never seems to keep dancers on tour long, like no multiple tours usually.
One and done I guess. She is always changing things up.
Including herself. Is she still Ester these days?
