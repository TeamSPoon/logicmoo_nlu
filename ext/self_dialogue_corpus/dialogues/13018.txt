Do you prefer the prequel trilogy or the old trilogy?
I prefer the old trilogy it, they were my favorite movies to watch as a kid
I prefer the prequels myself but i do enjoy the old trilogy aswell
The prequels were alright but i thought they kinda focused on the wrong aspects of star wars and the tone wasnt the same
I know what you mean in some ways the prequels dont really feel like star wars but i still enjoy them, what do you like about the old trilogy
I watched it as a kid and thought it was so magical and i instantly fell in love with it, the sotry and characters are very well done
Whose your favorite character overall?
Out of everyone id have to say luke of course even though i know thats obvious. What about you?
I really like Obi wan in the prequels he is very well done in my opinion
Yes i quite like him in the prequels as well. One of the things they did right, i like Ewan Mcregor  for that role.
