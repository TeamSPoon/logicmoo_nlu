Have you heard the soundtrack to the series Peaky Blinders? I hear there is a lot of good music attached to that show.
Yeah, I have and yes, there is. There is a lot of British bands of course.
Like who? I'm bad with names.
Nick Cage does a lot of their music. "Abattoir's Blues, Marth's Deam, The Boatman's Call" are all really cool. Kind of haunting.
That kind of sounds familiar. Who else?
Have you heard of the Weepies? They did quite a few.
I know about them. "Nobody Knows Me At All" is great. I also like "Somebody Loved."
Yeah, I'm pretty sure both of those have played on there. What about Tom Waits's "Time?"
That sounds about right. He has that kind of gravelly voice.
I think PJ Harvey, The Sapphires, and Queenies did some songs too. I'm sure I'm missing more.
Wow, for a drama they seem to have a lot of music.
Yeah, they do but it is all so perfectly timed.
I'm going to have to watch it and listen carefully.
I think one of the most amazing things is how they blended contemporary music with old time period and it seems seamless.
That's pretty cool but if you choose the right music....it can be timeless.
That's true. The Soldier's Minute and Red Right Hand are really good.
I look forward to hearing that music. What category do you think that music is?
Good question, rock maybe?
That's what I was thinking. I'm going to see what I can find.
If you find more, be sure to share. I am always looking for new music.
