Are you a Braves fan?
Yes! There are a lot of us here since Nashville doesn't have a team.
Did you see the game last night against the Nationals?
I saw that. That was great!
I don't think anybody expected them to win.
I'm always optimistic, but I didn't really have a LOT of hope.
The Braves seem really good to me sometimes.  But their record is pretty bad.
Yeah.  I was starting to get worried they might get off to the terrible start they had last year.
I hope Freddie's hand heals quickly.
They said it's broken in several places.
But Peterson is doing okay at first.
I think so too.
Dansby really messed up that one play, but he redeemed himself.
I really pull for him because he went to Vanderbilt and I did too.
The pitcher R.A. Dickey is from Tennessee isn't he?
Yes, and he did okay last night.
Every time Bryce Harper comes up to bat I can only think about that commercial where the baseball bubbles are coming out of his nose.
Right! That commercial is hilarious!
They play again today at 3:00.
I'll be watching.
