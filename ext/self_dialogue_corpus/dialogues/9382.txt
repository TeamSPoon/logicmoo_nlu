Do you listen to a lot of rap music?
I do on occasion. I like some of it.
Which artist do you like the best?
I really like Blackstreet from back in the 90's.
You mean they sing that one song "No Diggity" right?
Yes! That was really popular back then.
You're right I used to sing that all the time.
Me too! I enjoyed their music.
Do you know any more of their music?
Not really, "No Diggity" is the only one I can think of.
