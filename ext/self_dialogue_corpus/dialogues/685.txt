Man, I cannot wait until the start of the NFL season.
Tell me about it.
Yup, our Packers are going to dominate, I can feel it.
Right on, we're going for it all.
Aaron Rodgers MVP, he is going to come in with a vengeance.
Yes, all that criticism last year, he has something to prove and it will be great for our team.
Yes, we will at least win 14 games, maybe even undefeated this season.
Well I do not know about undefeated, but I can see 14 wins happening.
Come on man 16-0 and undefeated postseason.
Well I am worried about the Patriots, Seahawks and Raiders this season.
Yes, they will be good, but we will be better.
That optimism, I hope you are right.
I am, Brady is older, Wilson isn't near the passer Rodgers is and Carr was lucky less season.
Maybe, all I know is in Rodgers we trust.
Yes, but now we have a team that is ready to compete.
How do you think the offensive line will do this season?
I think they are going to get Rodgers time, he's going to get good looks.
I hope so, Rodgers with time is unstoppable.
Exactly, I think he will have a career year.
Well let's go out an win it all then!
