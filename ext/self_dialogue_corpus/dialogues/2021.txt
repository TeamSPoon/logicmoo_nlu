Do you know anyone who played in the NFL?
Sadly no, you?
No, had a cousin who played ball in college but that's it.
Do you have a favorite NFL team?
That's a hard one I like a few of them but the Packers.
Are you a fan of Aaron Rodgers?
No I was a fan of Favre's so that has stuck with me all this time even after his retirement.
That makes sense.
How about you?
Mine has to be the Colts.
Even after Peyton left?
Yep, he was great and I loved him but not the reason I like the team.
Why do you still like them.
I like them because of the season the coach was diagnosed with cancer and the team fought against all odds to win games.
I remember that, that was inspiring.
Yes it was.
That's the best reason i've heard to like a team.
Against all odds they proved themselves.
I like them too.
That's great.
