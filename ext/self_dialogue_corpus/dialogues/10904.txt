What did you think about Fast 8?
I thought it was okay, a little over the top if you ask me. I thought Fast 8 was better.
Why do you say that?
Well, the part where all the cars were dropping from the above parking garage and the auto driving cars causing havoc in the city, that was a little too cheesy.
Yea, I guess I agree a bit but that's how these movies usually are.  The storyline wasn't as good either.
Also, the part where they had 5 cars latched onto Dom's car trying to take it apart yet it remained steady.  A bit unbelievable.
I like how they worked Jason Statham into the story and he eventually became a good guy.
Yea probably.  I think they're going to have a story where Jason Statham is part of the team in Fast 9
You think there will be a Fast 9?
Yes, the movie franchise is on a roll right now.
