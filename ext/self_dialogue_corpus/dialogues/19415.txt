What's the most beautiful music?
I like a lot of classical music?
Oh really? Like what specifically?
Well not actually classical like Beethoven or something.
So like what?
Like anything with slow, soothing piano mixed with orchestral sounds.
Oh that sound pretty nice.
A piano cell and duo is my favorite.
I see! So like a new age classical.
Exactly. My favorite duo is the piano guys.
Oh I saw them on youtube. They do remakes of pop songs.
It's very beautiful. Sometimes, I get distracted by vocals, so I like how calming their music is.
What other arrangements do you know?
Funny you say arrangements since we're talking classical
What else would you call them. Bands?
You're right. How about compositions.
Sure. My favorite composition might be piano guys.
I think other compositions that are good are Larke, and Tycho.
I haven't heard of those.
They're pretty good!
