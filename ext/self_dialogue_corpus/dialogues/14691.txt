So what do you think about the MVP race this year?
It's going to be close.  Harden or Westbrook probably, right?
Who do you think will win?
Well there are two questions here.  Who do I think will win, and who I think should win.
Okay, who do you think will win?
I think it will be James Harden.
Why Harden?
Well to be honest his individual numbers aren't that much worse than Westbrook, and his team had more success.
That is true.  And to some degree the MVP award does reward team success.
But I think Westbrook should win.
Do you think he should win because of his triple double average?
Yes, definitely.  This was a historic season that should be rewarded.
What do you think about the argument that he was just racking up stats for the sake of getting a triple double?
I think that's a silly argument.  Every player racks up stats to some degree.
That is true.  And it's not like it's easy just to get triple doubles, no matter how much you try to rack up stats.
Exactly.  Everyone would do it if it were that easy.
Ok, truthfully I think Kawhi Leonard should be MVP.
Interesting.  I mean I am sure he will get some votes.
I think he's the whole package.  Good player on both offense and defense, and his team has had success.
I guess you could argue what else would you want from an MVP, right?
