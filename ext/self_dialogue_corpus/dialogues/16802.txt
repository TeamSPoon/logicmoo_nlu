Who is your favorite Classic Rock group?
I really like the Rolling Stones. You?
I'm more of a Beatles buff.
I didn't really like their stuff.
Come on! They had sooo much music, there's gotta be something you like.
I guess a few.
Anyone else you like?
Tom Petty.
For sure! How about Lynard Skynard?
Of course!
Well, then your not a total loss!
Ha! Jerk!
Sorry, kind of a music snob.
I won't hold it against you.
Do you like Alternative?
Like 90's stuff.
Yeah.
Yeah, kind of my generation.
My favorite is Nirvana.
Mine would be a toss up: Sound Garden, Nirvana or Sublime.
