Hi.
Don't interrupt me please.
Why?
I'm listening to music.
Who is this?
Wagner.
Huh.
Don't know of him?
Nope.
He's an amazingly bad person and an amazingly great composer.
Why?
You find out about the bad on your own.
So why is he a good composer?
He revolutionized opera and the music of his era.
Really?
Yep. Yurned opera on its head for the better.
Is that why you like opera?
Nope, just the music of Wagner.
Cool. I'll check his music out.
Great - you'll love it.
