I used to hate country and western music.
Yeah, but it has changed.
That's true. When I was a kid it was mostly honky tonk cheating music.
That stuff was horrible
Then I found groups like Alabama in my teens.
They had some big hits.
Then I found Willy and Waylon and Merle.
Okie from Muskogee is an all-time great.
Lord I Hope This Day is Good has become sort of a personal anthem.
I hear you. I have days like that.
My wife is a huge Patsy Cline fan.
She was great friends with Lorettal Lynn.
Loretta has been sick lately.
Yes, she had a stroke.
Who do you like today?
Too many to list them all.  I like Big and Rich.
I like Carrie Underwood.
Jesus take the wheel!
How about Rascall Flatts
Do they sing for the new Cars movie?
