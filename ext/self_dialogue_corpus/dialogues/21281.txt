Have you seen that movie  "The Switch"?
Yes, I loved it. Jason Bateman was too funny.
Seriously? I have never really thoguht of him as funny. Although the did ok in Horrible Bosses.
The Switch  was awesome, he couldn't figure out for the longest that the boy was his.
And his face in the bathroom scene when he spills the sample... that was easy to see coming, no pun intented.
He will never look at Diane Sawyer the same again!
I thought it was a believable enough story line. Lots of women are turning to invetro now adays and it was nice to see a movie address that in a light manner.
It was definatelyh a modern look into parenting and commented on older parents.
I don't think one can call Jennifer Anniston old, she is beautiful.
Wasn't she 45 when that movie was made?
Somewhere around there. But so what?
Biologically speaking, she was a little old to be having a baby. If they were going for realisim, that was never addressed.
I think the movie was more about unrequieted love and not so much hving a baby in ones forties.
Perhaps, but the age issue was addressed much stronger from his characters side than hers.
Are they even the same age in the movie?
Circumstances would lead one to believe so.
I didn't like how they introduced the biological father, made him appear creepy.
How did he appear creepy?
In the cafe, he was telling her that he has donated before and wondered how the baby was doing and started hitting on her.
True, I never got that the first time I watched it, but there are people that are serial reproducers. Kinda creepy now cause he did say he always knew this day would arrive.
