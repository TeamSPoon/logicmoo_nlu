Did you hear they just found some previous unreleased Thelonius Monk soundtrack to a French film?
No, where did they find them?
I'm not sure but it's this old film called Les liaisons Dangereues done in the 1960's.
Ah man! That is crazy. Did they say where it's been all this time.
Yeah, I can't wait to hear it I love his music. I think it's going to be released soon.
It must have gotten lost and forgotten in the archives.
Yeah, I love the way he uses off beat and tones in his music.
Is it supposed to be just like the other stuff he did?
Yeah, it was commissioned by the director of the film, but I guess it got lost through the years.
How much music is there?
I hear it's going be released as a 2 LP deluxe box set.
Man, that is a lot of music to have been lost for so long.
It should be exciting. You've heard of Blue Monk haven't you? It's one of my favorites.
Yeah, I have. I like it too. I think is the second most recorded jazz composer after Duke Ellington.
Really, I really thought Miles Davis would have recorded more than both of them.
No Ellington was probably the most recorded of all time. Coming in around a 1000+ works.
Really, he's not really one of my favorites. I'm more into Miles, Monk, and Bird.
Bird, you mean Charlie Parker?
Yeah, the dude was sick with a sax.
I know he was the ultimate cool.
