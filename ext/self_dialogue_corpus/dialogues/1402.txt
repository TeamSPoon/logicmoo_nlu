What do you think about the Quarterback situation in Houston?
The Texans?     After Brock Osweiler, anything would be better.
Yes, but that guy is gone.     What about the others.
They keep saying Tom Savage will start.
Is that a good thing?
I think we need to see how Deshaun Watson does in preseason.
He was incredible in college last year.
That is true, but the NCAA is not the NFL.
Don't they have another quarterback too?
Yes, Brandon Weedon is still on the roster.
What team did he come from?
Well, the last team he was with was the Dallas Cowboys.
Right.     They didn't draft him though, did they?
No, I believe the Cleveland Browns originally drafted Weedon.
Well, that's three, guys.    Will talent win out?
Watson is definitely the most talented, but sometimes it takes time.
I just hope they give him an opportunity.
Yes, let him learn.    I hope he takes over sometime during the season.
Well, if Tom Savage wins the job and makes it through the year, it can't be too bad.
I guess so, that means Watson can learn, and the team is doing good.
