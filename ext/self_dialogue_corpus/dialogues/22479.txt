Have you seen the new Amy Schumer movie?
No, I didn't know she had another one out. What's it called?
It's called Snatched.
What's it about?
It's about a mother and daughter that take a vacation to South America and have to get out of dangerous situations.
Oh, that sounds like it could be funny.
The concept is good, but it was really bad.
That stinks. What made it so bad?
It just wasn't funny at all.  I don't think I laughed once.
That doesn't sound very good. Who else was in the movie?
Goldie Hawn played Schumer's mom, so I was hoping it would be better.
Yeah I would think Goldie Hawn would make it good.
I thought so too, but it was disappointing.  Nothing like Trainwreck.
That movie was so funny!
I know! That's why I was hoping this one would be as good, but it wasn't.
I'm sorry it was so bad. Maybe there will be some better comedies that come out.
I can only hope so. Comedies are my favorite genre and I get so disappointed when they're not good.
I can understand that, especially if you're in the mood to laugh.
I was, but it just wasn't happening.
I'll be sure to not go see it then.
