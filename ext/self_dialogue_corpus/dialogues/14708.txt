Have you been watching the NBA playoffs at all?
Sort of, but I missed the Golden State Warriors vs. the Spurs today. Did you watch?
Yes! It was a really exciting game.
Which team won?
The Golden State Warriors won
What was the final score?
113 for Golden State and 111 for the Spurs
Oh wow, so it was pretty close then.
Yeah. The Spurs had a strong lead but lost it after Kawhi Leonard got injured in the third quarter.
Oh yikes. What kind of injury?
He hurt his ankle and had to sit out the rest of the game.
That's too bad. How did Steph Curry do in this game?
He did great! He scored 40 points.
He's so fun to watch. He's definitely one of the best shooters in the league.
I agree. He managed to tie the game with a 3 pointer with less than 2 minutes left.
Do you think he'll win MVP this year?
I doubt it, actually. I think Russell Westbrook is more likely.
Yeah he's been getting a lot of buzz. James Harden might be a strong contender too.
There's also always LeBron too!
True! We'll just have to wait and see I guess.
