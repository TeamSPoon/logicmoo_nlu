Is there a movie that you could watch over and over again?
Yes I love to watch the Mission Impossible movie. You?
Not really, I cannot watch a movie more than once or twice without getting bored.
Who is your favorite director?
I do not really have a favorite director, you?
I love Tarantino, his style of directing is unique.
Yeah I agree, Kill Bill is one of my favorite movies.
Have you seen any good movies lately?
No I have not, there has not been anything worth going to the movies and watching.
I recently saw Guardians of the Galaxy V.2 and it was pretty good.
Whats the best movie you have ever seen?
That is a tough question, I would say Braveheart is the best.
What made it the best?
I like action movies and the acting/directing in it was great. I think it may have won an Oscar.
How much does it cost to see a movie where you are from?
It is usually $15 for a ticket at my movie theater. You?
I like to go see 3d movies so the ticket is closer to $20 per person.
I have not seen any 3d movies, is it worth it?
Yes the sound and graphics are much better to watch movies, especially action films.
I will make sure that the next movie I see is in 3d and try it.
