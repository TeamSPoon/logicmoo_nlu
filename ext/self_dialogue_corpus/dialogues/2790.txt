Let's talk Pittsburgh Steelers.  How about their 2008 draft picks?
Ouch.  That was a tough one.
Yep.  Not one of their picks is still with the team.
You're right!  Bruce Davis!  He was a linebacker, right?
Yep. He went to the Oakland Raiders.
Only for a couple of years, though, right?
Yep.  He didn't pan out there at all either.
At least he ended up close to home.  Wasn't he from UCLA?
Yes.  Guess you he ended where he started.
What about Rashard Mendenhall?
Oh man.. he fumbled and people still blame him for the Green Bay Packers loss.
Well, ya gotta blame someone.
Yep.  Let's blame him.  He doesn't play for the Steelers now.
Huey Richardson is the one I remember as being a horrible pick.
Oh absolutely.   What about Tim Worley?
There's no way he was gonna be the next Herschel Walker.
No one can be Herschel Walker.
It's crazy someone actually thought that.
Well, we can sit here all day blasting Pittsburgh.
You know it.  Let's lighten the mood with Terry Bradshaw talk.
