What's your favorite superhero movie?
Probably Thor.
Why Thor?
Because it was a lot funnier than I expected it to be. Also, I really like Natalie Portman.
Oh I see, yea she is pretty great.
Yea, I also love all the trailers they put out on youtube and facebook.
Yea the social media campaigns for Thor are hilarious.
They really are, I like it when superhero movies don't take themselves too seriously.
Did you see the trailer for the new Thor movie?
You bet I did, it looks incredible, I can't wait to see him fight the Hulk!
