Who is your favorite actor.
I'm gonna have to go with Samuel L. Jackson.
Yeah, he's really good.
He's in everything!
Yeah, but they not all "good" movies.
True. Did you see Snakes on a Plane?
Yeah. That was hillarious!
Hillarious? It was an action flick.
In theory, but I veiwed it more as a spoof.
How do you mean.
It hit all the action movie cliches. It was great!
I guess I can see that, but it wasn't good.
I disagree, if you look at it from the spoof angle.
I never really liked spoofs.
Scary Movie?
OK. I'll give you that, but just the first one.
Yeah, the next 12 were pretty bad.
12? They didn't make that many.
I know. Just exaggerating.
Ha! Funny.
