Have you seen Django Unchained?
Wasn't Leonardo DiCaprio in that? Wasn't he some plantation land-owner in the South?
Yeah. Well, Hateful Eight is supposed to be the sequel to Django Unchained.
Really? The preview seemed different from Django Unchained.
That's what I mean. I watched a commentary that Tarantino did, and he said that somehow the original script for Hateful Eight was leaked and he changed his mind on the entire script.
So its not a sequel to Django Unchained?
No its not.
So why did you say it was a sequel if its not a sequel?
Because it was supposed to be a sequel.
But its not a sequel?
Why do you keep asking me that? I just told you its not a sequel.
Because you said it was a sequel to Django Unchained!
Ugh.... No I didn't! I said it was supposed to be a sequel!
I don't think Samuel Jackson is that good of an actor anyway. I think Morgan Freeman is a much better actor.
Morgan Freeman is so over-rated. He acts the same way in all of his movies!
Did you know that Stephen King wrote Shawshank Redemption?
Shawshank Redemption? Where did that come from? And we're not talking about Stephen King movies, and I thought Stephen King only did sci-fi or horror movies.
I would think if I was in Andy Dufresne's shoes that would be horror.
Oh, yeah? Well, what Stephen King novel is it based off of, then?
Actually, its based off of his short story called Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. Google it if you don't believe me.
