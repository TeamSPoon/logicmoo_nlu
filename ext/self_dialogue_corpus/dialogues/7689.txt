What is your favorite Harry Potter film?
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone .
Really the first one? But it was the most childish of all the series.
Well it is geared toward kids, all of them. This may be much less dark than say the final one. But I enjoyed it the most.
It was neat to get to see the actors grow up from this film onward.
I think so. Kids that were there age could really identify probably feed into the popularity more.
Daniel radcliffe is such a baby in the first one. In terms of looks that is. Harry the character has always been somewhat brave.
I think Hermione Granger was always bravest.
She was certainly well read and headstrong.
Emma watson was really perfect in that role.
