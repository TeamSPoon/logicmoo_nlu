I really think you would find them striking.
You really think so?
Yes, I do. I found some many compelling stories about them.
Can you share some of those?
There are plenty, some realting to the band and some relating to just the individuals.
Tell me one about a single member.
Sure, you got time?
Yes I do, I'm not doing anything.
Their drummer is about 80 percent deaf.
What? Was he bron like that?
No he has a rare genetic disease.
Do you know what it's called?
It'd called Alport Syndrome.
So it affects ones hearing?
Yes and it causes kidney failure.
Wow, I glad he is okay.
Yes, and doing what he loves.
I am happy for him not letting his condition deter him.
Me too, it is a great story!
Yes, it sure is.
