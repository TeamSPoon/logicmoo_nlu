So, Star Wars is pretty awesome.
I know right! what's your favorite one?
I like Episode one.
Really? Why episode one of all things?
Jar Jar was so cool!
HAHAHA! You had me going for a second. For real though. What's your favorite?
I'm serious dude. Jar jar should have been Killed so many times, he was so annoying, but he lived through all that stuff
Yeah, I guess I see your point kind of.
What about you dude? What's your favorite?
The original. Yoda in the swamp can't go wrong.
