Do you like Kelsea Ballerini?
I haven't heard of her I don't think. What type of music does she sing.
She is a country singer. Her latest hit is called yea boy.
I have heard that song, I never knew who sang it.
Do you like the song?
I do like the song. It is very upbeat.
A lot of her music is upbeat. You should listen to an album of hers.
Which album would you suggest?
The album she has is called the First Time. She has quite a few of her popular hit singles on that album.
I will check it out. Does she have multiple hits?
Yes, in fact she became the first new female artist to send her first three releases to the top of the charts.
That is impressive.
She is also a song writer, and wrote her first three singles.
That is impressive. What other songs does she sing?
Peter Pan is another hit of hers. It is not upbeat like yea boy.
I have heard that song too. I like the emotion she shares in that song.
Yes she said that it was based off of a nasty break up that she had.
Well that break up turned into a hit song for her. I bet her ex feels bad now.
Yes I bet your right. Make sure your pick up her album.
I will because I think I will enjoy it very much.
