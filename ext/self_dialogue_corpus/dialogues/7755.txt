What did you think of the final Harry Potter movie?
The fight scenes and special effects were crazy.
Plus Dumpedore and his master plot the whole time.
I liked the scene with Snape.
I know, he wasn't such a bad guy after all.
And maybe Tim Riddle wasn't as smart as he thought he was.
No he was, just so arrogant he couldn't see the forests through the trees.
I see, he thought Snape would abandon his love for more power.
And not everyone is like that.  And Voldy never understood love.
At the end I guess that was his undoing.
