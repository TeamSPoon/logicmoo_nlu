How did you like fast and furious 1?
I liked it a lot.
Yea, I feel its the best of the franchise
The newer movies have too much action.
The newer ones have a very different feel to the first few films.
Yea, but the actors pull it off very well.
I do miss Paul Walker.
He was a very good reason for why the franchise worked.
The cars really make the movies excitiing.
I like Vin diesels car in the 1st movie the best
