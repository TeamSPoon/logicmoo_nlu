Were you ever a fan of Creed?
Not really.  Why?
I just started listening to them again.  I really like their sound.
I never really was into them.  Didn't the lead singer go solo or something?
I'm not sure, but he did go into another band.
What was the name of it?
Art of Anarchy, i think.
Oh, do you like them too?
Yeah, but I'm a fan of Scott Stapp anyway.
I don't think I'd like it.  I never really cared for his voice.
