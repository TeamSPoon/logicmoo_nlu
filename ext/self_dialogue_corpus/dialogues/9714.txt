I've been listening to a lot of Kid Cudi lately. You a fan of his?
Absolutely, he really speaks a lot of truth in his songs.
I know, I love how he talks about a lot of topics that affect society.
I think it is important for rappers to try to make a positive impact.
I think another person who does that is Kendrick Lamar.
He has produced some absolute classics lately.
I also like some of his older stuff. He keeps it real.
I still listen to songs like king kunta quite frequently.
His songs don't get old.
I listen to some of his albums on repeat pretty often.
