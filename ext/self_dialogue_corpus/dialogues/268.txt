Have you seen Suicide Squad?
No. Was it any good?
Yeah. It was great. The best I've seen in a while.
What was so great about it?
I liked the actors a lot. The person playing Katana is a new actress that hasn't done much else.
That's cool but I heard some bad stuff about it.
I had to but I like how they set up the characters and everything is an adaptation of the original.
I guess so.
The comics books have changed harley and joker's story several times and that's all excepted.
You're right.
