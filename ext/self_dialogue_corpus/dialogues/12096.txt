Did you watch the Star Wars Rogue One movie?
Yes I did. Sad ending but the story was well very well written. Do you think they'll do another movie with the same characters?
I doubt it. I think they will want to continue the story from there. They've already given us the backstory for Jyn and Cassian.
Yes. I thought the story about how her father Galen Erso fought the Empire by working with them was really good.
It would be cool if they gave us more of a background for her parents though, like how they met and how he ended up fleeing the Empire in the first place. They didn't give us a lot of those details in Rogue one.
That's true. Also I'd like to see more about Saw Gerrera. I feel like his character was really interesting in Rogue One but they didn't elaborate much on him. I couldn't tell if he was a good guy or a bad guy, just that he helped raise Jyn Erso.
I also felt that the ending was expected but I kept hoping they'd find a way NOT to kill the two main characters off in the end.
Me too. I think the whole point of it was to have everyone root for them despite the knowledge of their impending death.
do you remember how in Star Wars when they talked about the how they obtained the blueprints for the death Star they said "many people died to obtain this information"?
Yes. That's pretty much what made me know they'd die in the end of Rogue One even though I kept hoping they wouldn't. Still it was a well told story.
