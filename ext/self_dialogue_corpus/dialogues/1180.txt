Can you believe the end of the superbowl last year?
No man, I still can't believe it.
It was crazy!
Yeah. As a patriots fan I obviously enjoyed it, but I really didn't expect it.
People can hate all they want, but the patriots are a fantastic team.
I am obviously inclined to agree.
I really think all that deflategate stuff got blown out of proportion.
Me too. But that's the media for you.
Is gronk going to be healthy for this season?
I think so. I'm not actually sure though.
As long as Brady stays healthy we should be good.
Definitely. I don't know how many more years he is going to play.
Me either. I just kind of expect him to be here forever.
Do you think the Patriots will make it to the superbowl again this year?
There's definitely a good chance.
I guess we will have to wait and see how they start to look once the pre-season starts.
Do  you plan on going to any games?
Probably not. I'd rather just watch them at home.
Same. Tickets are so expensive
I hear that.
