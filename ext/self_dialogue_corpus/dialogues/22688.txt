Samuel L jackson acts in everything
Was he in the Marvel universe?
Yeah he was Nick Fury
And wasnt he in Star Wars?
Yeah the prequel episodes.
Man what a guy
You wonder why he does stuff like Snakes on a Plane
That movie made money.
Yeah thats true and thats why he does crappy films.
If I were him I would try and do something else.
Like what?
Maybe a thriller or a drama.
I think hes been in all of them
He was also in the gory Tarantino films as well.
Yeah like I said, this guy has done it all.
I wouldnt be shocked if he retired sooner rather than later.
I agree with you.
HE could enjoy the piles of money hes made.
None of his roles though stood out.
Yeah hes never been nominated for anything.
