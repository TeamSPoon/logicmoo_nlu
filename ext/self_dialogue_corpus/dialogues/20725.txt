Are there any movies coming up that you're excited about?
I've heard good things about Black Panther.
Black Panther?  Oh, the Marvel one, from the Captain America movie.
Yeah, I liked T'Challa in Civil War.
So, what about Spider-Man?  I mean, the new one was in that too.
Homecoming?  No, I don't think I'm going to see that.
Really?  Why not?
Well, a few reasons: I'm actually pretty selective in my Marvel movies, there've been too many Spider-Man reboots recently, and I was actually slightly annoyed by him in Civil War.
So, then a definite no there.
Yeah, but like I said Black Panther sounds good, even though it's not until next year.  Also, pretty far off, but I'm looking forward to Ocean's Eight.
Ocean's Eight?  Like another sequel to Clooney's Ocean's Eleven?
Yeah, but more of a spin-off with Sandra Bullock as Danny Ocean's sister and a female crew she puts together for a heist.
Who else is in it?
Cate Blanchett, Rihanna, Anne Hathaway, Mindy Kaling, Sarah Paulson, and some others.
Rihanna?  The singer, Rihanna?
Yep.  You know, she was in Battleship, though the movie was terrible, she wasn't bad.
You saw Battleship?
It was on TV, I was curious.  It was a bit like watching a crash in slow motion - you could see it very wrong, but it was hard to look away.
I guess that happens sometimes.  I mean, I've watched a few SyFy Originals.
Yeah, I can't say it was fun, but it was certainly attention-getting.
