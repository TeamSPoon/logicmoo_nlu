Hey, do you like to listen to parodies of songs?
I sure do!  Do you have a favorite parody musical artist?
I sure do!  I have been listening to "Weird Al" for a while now.
I love Weird Al!  What is your favorite song?
It changes from time to time.  It is really hard to say!
I think my favorite is called One More MInute.  It is not so much a parody as a silly song.
I love silly songs!  That is one of my favorites, along with Amish Paradise!
I like that one too!  Do you know the artist for Gangsta Paradise said he did not give Al permission to parody that at first?
Really?  I thought Al always got permission first!
Yes, in fact, Weird Al said he did get permission.
Maybe Coolio just did not like this version?
Who knows?  I really enjoyed it, and I love the video as well.
Yes, he always has some amazing and fun videos!
He does, and he puts on a great concert, too!
You have been to a Weird Al concert?  That's awesome.
Yes!  We had three generations go to the concert.
And everyone enjoyed it?
They sure did.  You should go if you get the chance.
I wiil look into it!  Sounds like fun!
You will love it!  Weird Al is awesome!
