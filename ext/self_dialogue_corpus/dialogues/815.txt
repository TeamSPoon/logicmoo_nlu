Who do you think is going to win the NFC this year?
I'm thinking it's going to be the  Cowboys.
Why the Cowboys?
They have a great offensive line, Elliot is a beast and Dak will mature another year.
You forgot to mention their defense, they've made some improvements on that side too.
Yeah, Cowboys all the way in my opinion.
I happen to think the Falcons are going to win the NFC.
How come?
Even though they lost the Super Bowl last year, they will be hungry to get back.
I disagree with you, they lost Kyle Shanahan. It's going to hurt their offense more than you think.
Yeah, but they didn't lose any other players and they still have Matt Ryan.
I agree Matty Ice is a great quarterback.
Ryan is the best quarterback in the NFC behind Brees and Rodgers.
As long as Ryan doesn't get hurt, the Falcons will win at least 10 games.
You also forgot that they have Julio Jones!
Julio is the best receiver in the league.
In addition, they have the best 1-2 combo at running back with Freeman and Coleman.
Yeah, I overlooked them.  If you can run the ball it opens up everything on offense.
I'm thinking Falcons and Cowboys in the NFC title game this year.
Wait, what about Green Bay!
