Have you heard of Battle Beyond the Stars?
I think, but tell more about it so I can be sure.
Well, it's bascially the Maginificent Seven in outer space.
I think I've seen this, is George Peppard.
Yes, he play's Space Cowboy, a long haul space trucker who carring a shipment of weapons.
Yeah, and while he doesn't what to fight the villian Sador, he will teach the people of Akir with the weapons and teach them how to use them
Wasn't Robert Vaughn also in this movie.
Yes, he playes Gelt, a infamous assassin who is so successful he can't spend any of his wealth and has to live on a deserted planet.
Why does he want to help the poeple of Akir.
He simply wants a proper meal, which he hasn't had in years, and a place to hide from all his enemies.
Wasn't there also a group of white guys who all looked alike?
Yeah, that's Nestor, a collective  consciousness that seeks stimulation to avoid being bored to death, literally.
Now I remember Sador, but I feel I've seen him somewhere before, the actor I mean.
Ever watch Enter the Dragon?
Yes, I've watched all of Bruce Lee's movies.
Well, John Saxon, who plays Sador, also played Roper in that movie.
Okay, now I remember where I saw him.
Did you know who got his start in movies in Battle Beyond the Stars.
No, who do you mean?
James Cameron, the guy who directed the Terminator, did the special effects for this film after the original art director was fired.
