Did you like Episode 6 of the Star Wars saga?
Yes I did, I thought it had pretty cool scenes and its my favorite movie from the series.
Yeah it does have great visuals for the time and a nice story plot.
What part did you like the most.
I liked the final part, when Luke kills Darth Vader what about you?
When I found out that Darth Vader was Luke's father.
Looking back to the other movies its weird how Anakin became all darkside.
I know! and he could have had a different life with hes children.
I liked the costume and the voice of Darth Vader.
Yeah the voice creeped me out but I liked it.
