Have you seen the movie Mean Girls?
I did, but it's not my favorite. I liked the SNL cast being in it though.
They really are funny. Did you see Baby Mama with Amy Poehler and Tina Fey?
Yes, that was hilarious.
When Amy Poehler puts on the fake pregnancy belly and dances I laugh so hard.
That was funny! How about when she stuck the gum under the coffee table?
That was great. Dax Shepherd, who played Carl made me laugh so hard.
Haha me too. When he was on the toilet listening to "Red, Red Wine" I couldn't stop laughing.
Haha so funny. And he got the ultrasound of the squirrel!
Haha yes! I mean it didn't even look like a human. Come on!
