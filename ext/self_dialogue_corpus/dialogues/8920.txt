I never understood Speed Metal.
I don't either.
I do like heavy metal bands though.
Who do you like?
Metallica has some really great tunes.
They always put out good stuff like "Turn The Page".
Hey, the Bob Seger cover! Seger can belt it out too.
Bob Seger is a little before my time.
Well stick with listening to Metallica.
Just so long as it isn't speed metal I'm all for it.
