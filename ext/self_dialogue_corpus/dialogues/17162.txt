Have you heard of Bruno Mars?
Yes I love his music.
What's your favorite song of his?
That's a tough one.
How about one of your favorite songs of his.
Uptown Funk is a good one.
That songs beat is so catchy.
That's the best part of it plus the lyrics aren't bad either.
Any others you like?
Too good to say goodbye.
I don't think i've heard that one.
Come over tonight I have it we can listen to it and maybe some of his other stuff.
That would be nice want me to bring any other music?
Sure just bring whatever you like.
Why do you like Bruno Mars?
Well he's different and unique.
Yes but aren't a lot of singers.
Yes but he has this old school feel to him that is good.
When I think of him I do get nostalgic memories.
For good reason I think he was inspired by old music.
