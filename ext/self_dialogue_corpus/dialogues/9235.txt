What is your favorite old rock band?
How old?
The 80's or earlier.
Hmm, probably Metallica.
Wow, really? They are a little hard for me.
Yeah. My dad listened to them a lot, so it is kind of nostalgic.
I see. Mine is probably ACDC.
Oh, I like them too!
My favorite song is probably Thunderstruck. What is yours?
I really like Back in Black.
