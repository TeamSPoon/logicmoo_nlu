Have you seen that NFL show on Amazon?
No I haven't, what's it called?
It's called All of Nothing. I really recommend it.
Sounds good. What's it about?
Well, they go behind the scenes of a team, and follow them for a season.
Really? And show everything?
Yes - the arguments, the celebrations and the heartache too. It's a real insight.
What team do they follow?
Arizona Cardinals. Even if you don't support them you should watch it.
I definitely will. I'm a big fan of the head coach Bruce Arians.
He comes across really well in the show. I didn't know much about him before, but respect him a lot now.
What do you mean?
He works his players hard but always with their best interests in mind.
That's true, and he's got a reputation for helping the ones who are in difficulty too.
That's something you see a lot of. I'm not going to give any spoilers though!
Fair enough. Is it something the whole family can watch?
I don't think so. There's a bit of swearing in it.
That's a real shame, but I guess it's part of what makes it authentic.
Absolutely right, they don't put anything on for the cameras, it's all real and as it happens.
I can't believe I've never heard of it before! I'm going to download the first episode right now.
