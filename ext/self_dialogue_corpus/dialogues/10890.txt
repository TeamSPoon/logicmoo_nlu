That scene with the truck though in the movie is amazing
I love that scene it is so intense
I know is it something special
I honestly thought something would go wrong
It was begging for something to go wrong
I know right
Just one of the best scenes in the whole series
I know i was expecting him to fall of the moving truck
Precisely what i thought
I know man it was tense
