Have you seen the new Wonder Woman movie?
Yes, I loved the way she carried the sword in her dress.
I have seen a bunch of people posting photos of how they would carry a sword in their outfit.
I have seen a couple on Facebook and it looks pretty cool how they hide them.
Did you see the original Wonder Woman hugging the new Wonder Woman at some Hollywood event?
No, I have not seem that video. So, the old Wonder Woman is happy with the new movie?
Looks like it in the video they are smiling and happy together.
I'll have to check out that video.
I can send the video to you.
Thanks that would be nice.
