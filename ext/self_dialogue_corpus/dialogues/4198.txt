So would you classify it as a comedy?
No, I wouldn't say it was a comedy. It was more so subliminal jokes.
Oh, I see. Is it scary enough that I need a friend with me?
No, it's not that bad at all.
Ok, I think I'm going to check it out.
You should! I wactually watched it twice.
Why did you watch it twice? It was that good?
I just kept reading that you pick up on more of the subliminal messages after you watch it a second time.
Well did you?
I did! I guess they kind of went over my head at first for some reason.
