You like Harry Potter, right?
Yes, I do. Why do you ask?
I have just watched the films. What did you think of them?
Well, at first I was skeptical that they could live up to the books. I was suprised to see they were fantastic!
They were, weren't they? I loved them.
I am glad you got to watch them. Which was your favorite?
Well, you know I love Christmas time, so I think the Goblet of Fire.
I liked that one too. The dance that they have at Christmas time is lovely.
What movie was your favorite?
Well, that is a tough question, but I would have to say The Sorcerer's Stone.
