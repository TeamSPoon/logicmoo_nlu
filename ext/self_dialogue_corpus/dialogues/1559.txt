Yo! How are the Ravens looking this season?
Pretty good, pretty good.
I'm ready for the season to start. It's been too long.
Yeah, I know. They need to add two more games, if you ask me.
Tell me about it. Or at least make the playoffs longer.
Yeah, I could dig that too.
Who do you think an underdog is this year?
I don't know, but I think the Falcons are gonna be worse than last year.
Yeah, me too, actually. I think the Panthers take that division.
That's exactly what I was thinking.
They say Cam's not going to run as much.
Yeah. He needs to calm down with that.
He needs to become a pocket passer. That would suit them well.
They don't have any receivers though.
That's true. They need someone to step up.
You know who else looks good? The Patriots.
Oh yeah, definitely.
I think they're gonna win it all.
I wouldn't be surprised. Their pick ups this offseason have been nuts.
Yes indeed. Gonna great a great season for them.
