Did you see the new Star Wars Story, Rogue One?
Yes, I liked it very much.
Who was your favorite character?
Jyn Erso was probably my favorite.
Who played that character?
She was played by Felicity Jones.
Oh, yes. I thought she did a great job.
She did. I feel she made the character believable.
I agree. I like to see strong women characters.
I do, too. I think it's because of the original Star Wars heroine, Princess Leia.
