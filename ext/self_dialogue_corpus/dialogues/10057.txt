I just watched Die Hard for the first time in years recently.
The break through performance that made Bruce Willis a household name.
I totally forgot the dad from the Family Matters show was in it.
Yeah he was the cop that liked to eat Twinkies.
I gotta say Die Hard was still surprising good after all this time.
If you liked Die Hard you should check out Escape from New York.
I think i remember that movie. Is it the one with the guy that wears an eye patch.
Yup Kurt Russell played Snake Plissken in it.
Next time i have some free time i'm a check it out.
There's also a follow up called Escape from L.A that is worth seeing as well.
