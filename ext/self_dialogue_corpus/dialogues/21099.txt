Are you as excited as I am to see the new Baywatch movie?
Yes, I am.
I think it comes out on the 25th, and I'll be the first in line.
I'll be right there with ya.
Zac Efron really got buff for the movie.
He sure did.  Bodybuilder buff.
The Rock is looking good as usual.
Dwayne Johnson is always looking good.
I keep seeing previews online and they make me laugh so hard.
Yeah, they are hilarious.
It looks like a raunchy film.
That really is my kind of movie.
I wonder if David Hasslehoff will make a cameo.
Who cares.
Right?
Hah, you know he will.
That scene where they carry the fridges looks awesome.
Oh yeah, all that muscle on display.
I bet every gal in the theater is going to be screaming.
I sure will.
