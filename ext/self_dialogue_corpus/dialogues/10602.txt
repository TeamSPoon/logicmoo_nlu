do you think jason statham was a good decision to include in fast and furious series?
I think it was totally worth it. He is awesome, I am huge fan of him.
I am a bit skeptical about him, I don't know whether it's him or it's the role they assigned him.
Why, what's wrong with him or his role?
I feel that somehow he is misfit for fast and furious series.
Really? Why do you feel so? Any particular reason?
I mean they have portrayed him as this invincible guy who can do anything.
I think almost everyone in fast and furious series is portrayed that way.
Well, Not everyone, Maybe yes, But his character is way too off the ground.
I think it is more subjective matter.
