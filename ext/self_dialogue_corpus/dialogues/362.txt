Have you seen the trailer for Black Panther yet?
Yes I saw it during the NBA finals. It looks like it's going to be great.
Oh it definitely is. Chadwick Boseman was a great choice for role.
I agree, he really embodies the character of T'Challa. I love that he was introduced first in Captain America.
I wonder if Storm is going to be in Black Panther.
She would have to be. That was his wife.
True but you know how they sometimes leave important things out. I wonder if Stan Lee will make an appearance.
He has in all the majority of the others. It's pretty commonplace for him to show up.
My kids love watching out for Stan Lee in the Marvel movies.
Mine too. They loved when he was trying to convince the bouncer in The Fantastic Four that he was really Stan Lee.
