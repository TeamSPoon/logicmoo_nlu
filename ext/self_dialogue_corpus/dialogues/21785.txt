I can't believe they still make Transformers movies.
Yeah, they started, what? Ten years ago?
The first one came out in 2007, so you're right.
A full decade of films. It's surprising there's only been 5 during that time.
Michael Bay took a couple breaks in between to make other movies.
That explains it. Is the new one getting good reviews?
No. These films never review well.
But people like them anyway, I guess?
They seem to make a billion dollars on average, so yes, someone must like them.
They're okay. They're not good, but they're not horrible.
Which one is the best one, in your opinion?
Oh, I don't know. Maybe Dark of the Moon despite the silly title.
Oh. Well, in my opinion, Revenge of the Fallen is the worst one.
No arguments here. Even Age of Extinction is better than it.
I wonder if this new one will somehow be worse.
It probably depends on who you ask. Some will say it's the best one yet.
Well, it does have Transformers fighting Nazis. Maybe it's worth seeing on the novelty alone.
Don't forget Transformers meeting King Arthur, too!
Good or bad, they're certainly strange movies!
It's the reason I always see them. Curiosity gets the best of me.
