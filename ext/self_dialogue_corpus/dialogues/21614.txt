Are you going to see the New Tupac movie?
I dont know I heard it really was a truthful story being told.
Where did you hear that from
A couple people plus online I saw that jada pinket said how they portrayed her and tupacs relationship was not factual.
Yeah I saw that on instagram and it kindsa made me mad.
Huh? Why did it make you mad?
Because I feel like people are not gonna go see the moview because of what she said and it isnt right.
Ok but she is talking about the part that was about her life if she saying it wasnt like that then it probably wasnt.
Ok but why but that on social media tho. Unless she trying to deter someone from going to see it
Because im sure she got asked how did she like it since everyone knows that her and pac was good friends
Look all im sayimg is everybody complains about there not being enough movies about our culture right?
Yeah they do cause there is not enough
Ok then her is a movies about one og the greatest rappers of our time and people talking down on it. I want to see it because its about him to honor his memeory
ok ok I get what your saying but if a movie is sayimg that is about someone life saying that its about there life story then it should be 100 percent facts right?
Yes I agree but you know as well as i do the have to put certain things in it to make people want to see it.
Yeah i never though of it like that I guess your right
So do you wanna see it with me cause im dying to go
Yeah ill go i wonder if they are gonna talk about who killed him
I would think no because they never caught the person who killed him
yeah but they could talk about theories tho.
