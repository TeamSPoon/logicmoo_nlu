Did you see "The Silence of the Lambs?"
No, I haven't. Does it star Anthony Hopkins?
Yes it does! They also made a sequel and prequel to it.
I think I heard they had to deage him for the prequel.
They did. I really recommend seeing all three.
Are they really a thriller or are they a blend of comedy and jump scares?
They are truely a thriller. Not a blend at all.
Good. I don't like when they blend things.
It is worth the time to watch them all.
I will.
