Do you have season tickets to NFL games?
Yes, we have season tickets to see the Pittsburgh Steelers!
Really - I didn't know you were a Steeler's Fan!
Yes, my whole family is, ever since the days of Terry Bradshaw.
They have a really nice stadium in Pittsburgh, don't they?
Yes, PNC park is great, and they have a great view of the city.
I hope that they have a good season - Roethlisberger is a great quarterback.
Yeah, I'm hopeful that this will be a good year.  Bell had a descent rushing record last year.
Their kick return yardage was OK.
Sure - there is always room for improvement, but I think that Toussaint will lead in that department.
When did the Stellers last win a Super Bowl?
They last won the 2008 Super Bowl - that was a great year.
Right - when they beat the Cardinals - that was a close game too.
Indeed - and the 100 yard interception by Harrison was fantastic - we were cheering on that one!
I think that the Steeler's offense needs to be more aggresive.
Yes, some years their defense is their strongest area.
Do you ever have tickets available for the games?
Yes, sometimes I have one or two Steelers' tickets available - interesting in coming to a game!
Yes - I would love to see an NFL game live - I have not been to one in a long time.
Great - bring your Steelers' jersey!
