I love George Michael and Wham.
Yea he was great.
Do you remember the song Wake me up before you GoGo?
Yes I do.
I remember watching that on MTV in 1983. My daughter was one and would dance away when that came on.
He had some great songs.
Do you know that he sold over 115 million albums during his careet?
I did not know that.
Yes he was one of the top selling musical artists of all time.
I really loved the song FAITH.
That was a good one.
He grew up in Britain, his dad was greek and owned a restaurant.
What did his mom do.
She was a dancer.
It is a shame that so many musicians are dying so young.
He would have had a lot more hits I think.
I think so too.
I read that he was the most played artist on British radio between 1994 and 2004.
That 's interesting.
He had quite a career.
