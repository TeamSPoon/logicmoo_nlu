Who is your favorite artist currently alive?
I would pick rolling stones. I think they are classic yet still in style.
They are more of a  band than a single artist but great band.
They sure are great. I have been to 4 concerts including the sars feast in Canada.
oh that is neat. How was that sars fest concert?
It was pretty packed, so many people came. A lot of artist performed as well, which was cool.
It was because of what illness again?
Remember swine flu? Well Toronto had affected ,(I think) and so they had this charity concert.
What other bands were there? Did you see them?
I was there for most of it . AC/DC, Justin Timberlake and Stones.
How was justin seems a weird mix.
At the time he was not as popular or respected yet, or at least by this crowd.
what makes you think that?
Well he was actually somewhat booed. One guy threw something on stage at him.
Really? That seems aggressive and awful.
I felt badly for him. i liked his performance. But when most are there to see AC/DC  and the stones not always a justin friendly crowd.
It just takes one bad apple to spoil it. Too bad.
Keith Richards was on stage at the time and threatened the guy who threw the bottle.
Really ? that is funny and cool. Got to love Keith.
Ya, Keith yelled something and did the slow cut across the neck with his finger at the guy.
