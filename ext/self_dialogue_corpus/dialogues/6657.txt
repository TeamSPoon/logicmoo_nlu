What happens in the movie Fuzzbucket?
A boy gives a concoction to his imaginary friend and then he comes to life.
Wow, what does he look like?
He is a furry looking and short guy. He has a tail.
What happens to him?
He eventually goes home where all of his people are.
Cool, anything else?
Yeah, the boy's parents do not believe him.
I wouldn't either.
It's a great movie though. Not many people know about it. But, it is Disney.
