What is your favorite football team?
My favorite team is the New Orleans Saints.
Why is your favorite team the Saints?
I've just always liked them.  Since becoming interested in football, some players from my university have played for the Saints.  I'm sure that contributes.
What is your least favorite NFL team?
My least favorite NFL team is probably the New England Patriots.
Why don't you like the Patriots?
I think a lot of football fans don't like them because they've won the Super Bowl a lot.  I think it also has to do with the type of winners they are.
Have you ever been to an NFL game in person.
Yes.  For a short time my family had season tickets to the local NFL team.
Have you been to an NFL game recently?
I haven't had the opportunity recently.  We don't live in an NFL market, so it makes it harder to get to a game.
Do you still enjoy watching NFL games.
Yes, especially Saints games.  When I can't get Saints games in my television market, I'm likely to watch one of the games that is broadcast.
Do you just have cable, or do you subscribe to the NFL Broadcast package?
We don't have either, but I have subscribed to the package in the past.  We can still get local market games via antennae.
Which do you like more about the game of football, offense or defense?
While I get the importance of defense, and agree that's most often where a game is won or lost, I enjoy watching the offense more.
What would you change about the NFL?
What immediately comes to mind is the ongoing controversy with brain trauma.  I also think the game is slowing down, it needs to become more 'wide open'.
