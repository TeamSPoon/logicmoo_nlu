What do you think about the AFC East?
Well, doesn't it start and end with the New England Patriots>
Certainly, but have they changed enough?
Yes.   First, there's Brandin Cooks.
A hot wide receiver, sure to improve the position.
A big loss for New Orleans.
Definitely, but they are already packed there.
For sure, but I would be surprised if they don't hold on to at least five guys.
OK, so the Patriots are your pick.
The division should be easy, a decent chance at a championship repeat.
What about the rest of the division?
The Dolphins have their Tannehill issue at Quarterback.
So you see problems all year?
Yes.     He is good, but cannot carry a team.
So, what about the bottom dwellers?
The Buffalo Bills are bad.
Still, you don't see them as a last place team?
No, they still have enough talent to keep their heads above water.
That leaves the New York Jets.
Yes.      The Jets are easily the worst team in the division.
