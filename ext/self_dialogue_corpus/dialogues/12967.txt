Did you ever get to see the Star Wars movie Rogue One?
Yes I did.
What did you think of it?
Well, all the Star War movies are great, but this one wasn't at all what I had expected.
I know.  It was kind of cool seeing how the Death Star was created.
But who would have thought the creator of the Death Star really didn't want to do it.
I really like how they bring in strong female characters into the story line.
I loved Jyn's character, and how she was willing to do everything in her power to prove her father was a good man, and had made a way to destroy the Death Star.
I also loved the way they tied it to Princess Leia.
Did you know that the day we went to see it was the day Carrie Fisher passed away?
