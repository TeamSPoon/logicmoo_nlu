What's your dream house like?
Probably the beasts castle in a Beauty and the Beast.
Oh good choice. Would you want all the firniture to be alive?
Absolutely. I would want them to perform "Be Our Guest" every night before dinner.
Haha, wouldn't you get sick of it?
I didn't as a little girl and I don't think I would now.
Valid point.
Plus the library is amazing. I would spend most of my time in there.
Wow you really are just like Belle.
That is the nicest thing anyone has ever said to me.
