How do you feel about David Lynch?
A bit mixed.
How so?
Well, "a bit" is just what it means...I like him mostly.
What do you DISlike?
He'll throw in a bit of obscurantism and doesn't always finish what he started.
Any examples?
Yeah. Some of the stuff in Mulholland Drive didn't seem to have any real purpose. It's mostly funny, though.
Like what?
I never got what exactly had happened to the two girls.
Was too much effort put into making it mysterious?
Maybe. He can lay it on thick. I'd have to see it again. Like I said, I'm a fan overall.
I take it you feel similarly about Twin Peaks.
Spot on. I'm a huge fan, but some things I just worry are never going to be resolved.
It doesn't help that a good chunk of the old cast won't be returning. How do you think it'll end?
No idea. That's both good and bad!
What if it turns out well?
Then I'll like him that much more.
It'd be nice to see it end well.
Honestly, if he knows what he's doing, I wouldn't mind the revival lasting longer. We'll see.
