Absolutely loving the new EP from The Scandals, have you heard it?
No I haven't, I didn't even know they put out a new one.
Oh man you're going to love it, it's produced by Brian Fallon.
Wait, you mean the Brian Fallon, of The Gaslight Anthem?
You bet, his DNA is all over it, sounds like old Gaslight.
Oh my god I can't wait to hear this now.
Yep, Brian Fallon dipping his toes back into punk after Painkillers is a treat.
Though is it just going to make me miss Gaslight?
It might, but it might also make you feel okay that The Scandals can fill that void.
Very excited now, Jared Hart has a great voice.
