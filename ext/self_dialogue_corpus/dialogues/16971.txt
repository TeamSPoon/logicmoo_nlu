Did you see the Open Air Festival lineup?
Yeah, it's pretty stacked.
Tell me about it! Rage of Prophets?!
I can't wait to see them!
I'm excited to see Marilyn Manson myself.
He's definitely a wildcard. What Manson will we get? Hopefully a sober one.
Supposedly he's been clean for awhile now so we shall see.
I hope so for his sake. He's been touring forever now.
Yeah, he's a veteran now. Getting up their in age now as well.
Yeah. How do you like his recent music?
Honestly, it's alright but nothing to ride home about.
Yeah his stuff in the late 90s/early 2000s was amazing compared to now.
Those were definitely his prime years for sure.
Mechanical Animals was absolutely fantastic.
Mechanical Animals is still one of my favorite albums of all times.
Yeah, it still sounds great to this day.
Trent Reznor produced it too. Absolutely amazing job.
That's Reznor for you though.
You got a point there. He's one of the best.
Yeah. I can't wait for new NIN soon.
