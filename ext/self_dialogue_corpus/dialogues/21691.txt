Wanna know something crazy? True Lies is only available in HD, uncropped on D-VHS.
What the heck is a D-VHS?
It was a VHS format that released for home use in 2002. It was basically true, 1080i HD quality film, but on a VHS.
I've never heard of it before. What does it have to do with True Lies?
Well, you see, when the film was first released, HD TVs weren't common.
Of course not, that was 1994. No one had big screen TVs yet.
Yeah, and so, the common thing to do was pan and scan the movies.
Right, that's that thing where they zoom in on the picture, and move it along with the footage to try and fill up the whole screen, right?
Yeah, you fill up the screen at the cost of losing some of the video. Nowadays no one does that, of course.
Right, but what's the big deal? So what if True Lies had that done to it if every movie did?
It's because James Cameron loved the pan and scan version of the film so much, he kept it for all the following releases.
What? That's crazy!
The only release that doesn't have the pan and scan and is in HD is the D-VHS release.
And let me guess, D-VHS players aren't too common?
Not really, no.
Just as well, I suppose. We're even moving past Blu-ray into 4K UHD Blu-ray now.
We'll just have to hope that James Cameron gives in and allows a release with the unedited film. Or at least, the option to choose it over the pan and scan version.
Yeah, I'm sure it'll happen around the same time as he releases those Avatar sequels he always talks about.
Until then, I guess if you're a big fan of the movie you'll just have to invest in a D-VHS player.
No thanks. I'll stick with the LaserDisc version, thank you very much!
