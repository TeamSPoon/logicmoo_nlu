I just read that Knile Davis is learning the playbook for this year. It's about time.
Yes he is. With his speed, the Packers will rule this year.
He didn't play much last year.
That's probably because he didn't know the playbook well.
Didn't Aaron Rodgers say something about him not being ready?
I'm not sure, but I read that the coach mentioned it.
I knew someone said it. Do you think they'll do good this year?
I think with his speed and Aaron's abilities, they'll make a great pair!
Isn't Aaron getting old?
He's only 33! I think he's still got some great years ahead.
I'll stick with my Panthers.
Has Cam recovered for this year?
I read that he's doing well at practice and should be playing.
He's a pretty good quarterback.
Yes he is. He's always underrated though.
That happens a lot. He's no Aaron Rodgers, but I still recognize his abilities.
He's getting better and better!
I doubt he'll ever be as good as Aaron, though.
I guess time will tell, my friend!
Yes, we shall see!
