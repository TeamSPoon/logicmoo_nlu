The Bee Gees were a good band.
Really? I guess so. If you were into disco.
Well I wasn't but still like some of their songs.
Yea I guess some were ok.
How about Stayin ALive?
That was ok.
They had a lot of hits. Only Elvis, the beatles and a few other bands had more top hits than them.
Wow, I did not know that.
They formed in 1958 as well so they were around for quite a while.
It is too bad that two of them are gone.
I think one died from an overdose .
Did you like the song How Deep is your Love?
Yea it was good.
Night Fever was one of their big dico hits.
Yea, true.
The other brother Maurice died from cancer.
I guess one is still alive, I wonder if he is writing or singing anymore.
I do not know.
I bet they have an interesting musical career.
Oh for sure!
