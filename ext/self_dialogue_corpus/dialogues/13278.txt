Do you think that The Last Jedi is going to repeat The Empire Strikes Back?
I'm not sure. What makes you think that?
The trailer seems to share imagery with that movie.
Oh, did you mean the AT-AT battle portion?
Yeah. That's one part.
I don't think that it is going to be the same.
Who is your favorite character out of all of the movies?
Emperor Palpatine is a great villain, but I'd have to go with Luke.
Agreed. However, I kind of hate what they did to him in The Force Awakens.
What should they have done?
