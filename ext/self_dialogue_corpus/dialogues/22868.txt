Hey, have you seen the Shrek movies?
Oh my goodness yes!  They are my favorites.
Yeah, they are some of my favorites too.  I just got done watching all of them together.
Which one is your favorite?
That's impossible to choose!  The first one is hilarious, but the others are truly great too.
Yeah, plus Puss In Boots is awesome, did you see that one?
Yes it's hilarious too.  I love how they keep the characters going through all of them.
I know.  I thought Forever After was great.
Yeah, it got a little more complex.  That was definitely interesting.
Shrek Forever After is the one where he had the babies, right?
I think so.  It was the one with Rumplestiltskin.
Yeah, I get them all mixed up.  They are all fabulous, though.
I think the first was my favorite.  I love the Gingerbread man.
Gingie? Yeah that is absolutely hilarious and so original.
Yes, plus Pinnochio cracks me up.
Oh yeah, he is a riot.
In Puss In Boots do you remember Kitty Soft Paws?
Yeah she's awesome!  She's his girlfriend right?
Yes his partner.
They should do a follow up to that movie.
