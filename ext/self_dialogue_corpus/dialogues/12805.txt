Do you have a favorite song from any of the Star Wars movies?
I like the Cantina song.
You mean Jabba Flow from The Force Awakens?
No. I mean from the original Star Wars movie.
Oh that song was pretty good.
Which song do you like best?
I like the Darth Vader march.
Why is that?
I think the song is very powerful just like Darth Vader is.
That makes sense.
