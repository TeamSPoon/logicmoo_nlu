What is the best Adam Sandler movie?
I would say Billy Madison
That was great
What was your favorite scene?
When he talks about the puppy who lost his way
And the host berates the answer?
Yeah that part.
That was hilarious to be honest with you
How about yours?
From the time it started until it finished.
