Ever listen to Lady Gaga?
A little bit.  I know only a couple of her songs.
Yeah, me too, but they're pretty good.
I know, may not be my preferred style.  But she's one of the talents of this decade.
She was amazing during the Super Bowl.
I thought so too.  And a couple years ago when she sang the National Anthem.
She just has one of the best voices out there.
Poker face was a good song.
Yeah it was, that and perfect allusion.
I agree.   She's talented too.
Yeah she is, did you see her in American Horror Story?
Yes I did.  I'd like to go to one of her concerts.
Me too, she's an awesome performer.
You know what else is a good song?  Alejandro.
Yeah, I like that one.  I'm ashamed to say I sing along.
Ha, don't worry I do too.
Born this way as well.
You know, I guess we know more Lady Gaga than we think.
I guess you're right.
She's surely a great talent.
