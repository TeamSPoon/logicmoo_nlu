What would you say is the worst book-to-movie adaptation that you've seen?
That's a tough question, considering most are usually not as good as the source material.
If you had to choose one though?
Probably 'Eragon.'
Oh, I remember those books.  The movie was so awful.
I remember being so disappointed as a kid.
I remember disliking it too.  It barely included the best parts of the book.
I know.  They even had John Malkovich, but under-utilized him.
It's a shame because it basically guaranteed that we probably won't ever see another live-action version.
A movie for the second book would have been so fun.
I agree.  Are there any adaptations you do like?
Yes.  Harry Potter was well adapted for the big screen.
Excellent choice.  That is mine as well.
Not only was it adapted well; the movies also added different depths that the book did not have.
I think you can thank the main cast for that.  Especially Daniel Radcliffe, who grew into a great actor.
Yea he is truly talented.  Have you seen him in 'Swiss Army Man?'
Yes I did.  He had such a good rapport with Paul Dano's character.
The script for 'Swiss Army Man' was great to begin with.  Combined with the acting talent, there was no way it could fail.
Don't forget the brilliant work of the director, Daniel Scheinert.
Remember, they had two directors.  Dan Kwan was the second one!
