Hey, have you seen the movie Hanna?
No, but I saw the promos for it. What is it about.
Well, the title character Hanna is a young girl raised by a former CIA agent, who taught her how to be an assassin.
Okay, that sounds a little warped.
Well, Hanna is the result of CIA program to produce super soldier's throught genetic enhancement of children in the womb.
Okay, so he's training her to be an agent?
No, he's training her to survive, because the program was terminated and all test subjects destroyed, save Hanna.
Ah, so Hanna is learning to fight so she can stay alive if and when the CIA discovers she's still alive.
Yes, pretty much and the that's what the film is about.
Okay, I'll definitely find time to watch this film.
