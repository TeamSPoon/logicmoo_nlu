Hmmm, what dance would go best with this dance?
Not sure, I was thinking of using the samba, or the cha cha cha.
Ummm, I think those are some bad dances.
Why? Is the beat too slow for them?
One: Yes, and two, those require a more peppy-like, fast movement music.
Hmmm, you're right, maybe I'll pick another genre instead.
Like what? We were given this one for our assignment.
And what, we can't change it up a bit?
NO, we were given this song title, so we gotta use this with what we have for our dance materials.
Why don't I change this music up a notch, then?
How so?
I'm gonna use a synthesizer to change up the beat!
And what if our professor denies this?
Well, screw it.
Ummm, no, I don't think this is a good idea.
Why not?
Because it's difficult to change in the middle of our routine
.Well, what can we replace it with?
Maybe with a little bit of style and flair! Not with our music, but our costumes! Say, instead of a long dress, why not a fur coat? Say, a huge black fox fur coat?
WOWIE, YOU WANNA WEAR A FOX FUR COAT? I'M DOWN TO DANCE WITH YOU, GIRL!
