What is your take on the movie Captain America: Civil War?
I liked it.  The division that came up in it was interesting.
Yeah that played a big part in it definitely.
What did you like about it.
To me it developed the characters more, and you got a better sense of motivations.
I felt like I knew them better afterwards.
Right.  Tony Stark came across as a bit of a hardliner until the point when they reconciled.
It felt like everything was his fault, by being so demanding.
Agreed.  The ending went on far too long.
But at least it was happy.
