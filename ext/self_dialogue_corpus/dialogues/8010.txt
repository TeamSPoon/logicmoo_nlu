Did you see that Katy Perry has tried to make peace with Taylor Swift?
No way!  That fight has been going on for song long I don't remember what it was about.
I guess she finally said that she is sorry and forgives her and wants to move on.  She even said she loves her!
That is a pretty big change, especially since she just released a song about her.
I didn't know she released a song about Taylor Swift.
Yeah, it's called Swish Swish and it sounds pretty much like a fight song to me.
I haven't heard that one yet.  I did hear the Bon Appetit song though, it was ok.
I saw the video for that one.  It is pretty weird.
What makes it so weird?
Basically its a video where Katy is food and they prepare her dinner.
