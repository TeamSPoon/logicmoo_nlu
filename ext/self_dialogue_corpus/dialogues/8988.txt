Hey, did you hear there was a new music video released from Chris Cornell from Soundgarden?
No, where did that come from?
It's for the song "The Promise" and was filmed before he died in May.
Why did they wait until now to release it?
He wanted it released on the same day as World Refugee Day, which was Tuesday.
Where did they film it?
It was filmed in Brooklyn, New York.
I didn't know he was that passionate about refugees.
He toured refugee camps with his family, and the family foundation was trying to help refugee children.
It's a shame he's gone, he obviously cared a lot about people, and a lot of people cared about him.
