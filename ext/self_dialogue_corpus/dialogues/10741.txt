Did you like Fast & Furious 6?
Yeah I did mostly because The Rock was in it.
Isn't his real name Dwayne Johnson?
Yes it is, he also used to wrestle in the WWE.
Neat, do you remember the scene where they are having a cook out and The Rock walks up?
Yes and Roman tells the girl she better hide her baby oil.
Then The Rock said you better hide that big forehead.
That was a really funny part.
Did you know that part was improvised?
No I didn't that's awesome.
