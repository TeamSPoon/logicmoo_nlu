Did you see the Golden State, Spurs game last night
Yeah, the Spurs don't have a chance
I know, even with Lenoard, they probably would have only won one game.
I know, and without him they probably will get swept.
What about Cleveland the other night
They looked awesome against the Celtics
Lebron is the fucking man
I know, 14 years into the league and he is better than ever
The man is ridiculous
I know, he is probably one of the 5 best players ever.
As good as they played, do you think they can beat the Warriors.
I don't know, if they keep playing like that, they have a good chance.
The Warriors just have so much talent.
With Curry, Green, Thompson, and Durant, they are amazing.
Cleveland will have to play better than ever to beat them.
Lebron, Irving, and Love and going to have to play out of their mind.
It could be one of the best series ever.
I know, it will be a hell of a series.
I can't wait to see it.
Me to, I will watch every game.
