Hey did you hear that they were making a new sequel to the World War Z movie.
You mean the one with  Brad Pitt in it?
Yes they said it would be released in June of 2017 then they pulled it. But i heard they are doing the sequel and possibly releasing it in 2018 or 2019
I hope they keep Brad Pitt as the main actor he did great in the last one.
Im pretty sure he will be in the sequel also.
Do you know any other actors that may be in the sequel or even what the plot is to this one.
I have not heard of any of the other actors that will be in the ovie but they confirmed Brad Pitt would be returning to his role
And the plot since they kind of didnt leave room for a sequel
Im not to sure but i think if anyone can pull it off and make a great David Fincher can
So David Fincher will be directing the World War Z sequel.
Yes i love most of his movies and he know how to work with Brad Pitt they have done a few movies together.
What other movies have the 2 done together that you have seen.
Ive seen Fight Club, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, and Seven
I loved all three of those movies
He also has directed several other great movies and worked with some well known actors.
I know he has also worked with Micheal Douglas and Robert Downey Jr.
Yes  so you can see why im so excited for the release of World War Z 2
Yes a awsome director and a good actor hopefully they can reunite the cast members
I would really like to see some of the original cast members i hate it when they change actors.
I agree i like it when they can keep the same group together it makes the story line better.
