Have you seen the movie 48 Hours?
No, I've heard about it a little, it has Eddie Murphy and Nick Nolte in it, right?
Yes, Nick is a cop and Eddie is a felon who have to work with each other to catch a escaped member of Eddie's former heist crew.
Really, why's Eddie helping a cop catch one of his own?
Because the guy's a cop killing psycho who want's the money they stole from a drug dealer all for himself.
Really, so how's Eddie going to help Nick.
Eddie knows his old partners hangouts, friend, and habits. Also, he knowns were the stolen money is and wants it for himself after he gets out of prison.
Okay, so what does the 48 hours name have to do with anything?
That's how long Nick can have Eddie out of jail to help him, afterwards he has to return to finsih his remaining 6 months.
Cool, but wasn't there a sequel to this one?
Yes, it's called a another 48 hours.
Okay, so what is the plot of that one?
Nick and Eddie have to work together again, so Nick can bust a major Drug kingpin called "The Iceman".
So , what does Eddie's character have to do with it?
The Iceman has put a contract out on Reggie and one of the hitmen is the brother of Eddie's old partner from the first film.
So, revenge plays a part here?
Yes, plus Nick is under investigation over a related incident where he shot a felon, but the felon's gun can't be found, calling the shooting into question.
Hey, one question, why does the Ice Man want Eddie dead.
Because he was the drug dealer that Eddie and his gang sole the 500,000 from the first film from, plus Eddie can identifiy him to Nick.
Okay, that makes sense then.
