Who is your favorite pop musician?
That's a tough question. I would have to say Bebe Rexha.
She has not put out many songs at this point, has she?
Nope! She is very new. But she has some great songs already.
Like what? I'd love to check some out.
Listen to the track "I Got You"
Is that from her latest album?
I think she recently released it on an EP
Doesn't she have a song coming out with Lil Wayne too?
She does! It just came out. It is all about dancing.
