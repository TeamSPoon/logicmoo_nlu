Are you a fan of rap or hip hop?
Sure, I like 2 Pac and the like, what about you?
Oh so you are like a 90s fan of hip hop, like Biggie Smalls.
Sure, there is something about that era of hip hop and rap where it was all about being influence by crime and ballin
Do you like Snoop Dogg? I would say I am a fan but limited to certain tracks.
I don't know if I like Snoop Dogg as much as I like Mac Dre. Andre Hicks really defined what bay area rap is.
Totally Mac Dre is legit. Did you know he was one of the predecessors of the hyphy movement?
No, but what is the hyphy movement?
It is when music became more aggressive and it was all about a gangster lifestyle. Money drugs and cars, so many rap songs just based on those.
Do you like the Pharcyde? Such early 90s west coast rap.
I never really understood how west coast rap became it's own genre.
Well it was partly territorial and partly a response to the huge success of many east coast rappers.
Are you into like new hip hop and rap like Gucci Mane?
Yes and no, like with any era of music there are the good and the bad and the ugly.
One of my favorite older groups is Grayskul.
I am not sure I have heard of them. Tell me more.
Well they where formed from the large and popular group OLDMINION. They had there big breakthrough in 2005 when they where signed with a label.
So what is the style of that band?
I would say that they are very synth based rap but have that classic rap beat.
They sound I would very much enjoy.
