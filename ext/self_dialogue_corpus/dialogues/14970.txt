Adam sandler is a great actor
He is, he is really funny
And i dont think hes ever had a bad movie me either
I love them all
Me too, i think i like billy madison best, or whos your daddy
Its so hard to pick, but i really like happy gilmore
Thats a good one too
Hes a great actor
I hope he makes more movies
Me too
