Who is your favorite artist?
Mine is Elvis Presley.
That's cool.
I used to listen to him since I am a kid.
My dad listened to him all the time.
Yeah, mine too.
He always makes you want to shake and move.
His voice is tender, but yet can vary to rock and roll.
I am encouraged so much when I listen to him.
Me too.
His gospel songs really shatter any negative moods.
I go to them when I am sad and blue.
There is something about him that just warms you up and makes you in a lighter mood.
I like that too.
My dad and mom's wedding song was Elvis' "Love Me Tender"
That's cool.  My mom and dad's was Unchained Melody.
I know that one well.
Yeah, that's another great classic.
I like to hear those in the car just to relax.
Yeah or to get the spirits up.
