Have you seen the Saw movies?
Yes, I love them! I've seen all of them.
Me too! Which one is your favorite?
Not to be cliche, but I love the first one.
I mean, it did start the whole franchaise.
Basically, I love the fact it's in one room.
Me too, I think that really changed the movie game.
That was one of the first times a movie in one room was recieved that well.
Well, the first one is definetely good.
Amen to that.
