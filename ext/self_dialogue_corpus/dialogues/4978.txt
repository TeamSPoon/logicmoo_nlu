How 'bout those Yankees?
I was disappointed they got rained out last week.
Yeah, but they had a double header today.
Yup, won one lost one.
Did you watch the ceremony?
Yeah, retired Jeter's number!
What an honor, huh?
Yeah.  Loved watching them show all the great moments in his career.
Nothing beats the time he flung himself into the crowd to catch that ball!
Yup!  Always taking one for the team.
Nothing but total respect for him, even from the current players.
In another couple years he may be headed to Cooperstown!
No doubt!
Did you watch when they played the Cubs and they went into 18 innings??
Yeah, unbelievable!
Six hours of baseball!  What's better than that?
Right??  When are they playing the Redsox again?
Not till early June.
Those are my favorite Yankee games.
Yup--classic rivals!!
