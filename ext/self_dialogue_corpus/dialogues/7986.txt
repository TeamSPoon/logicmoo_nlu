I read Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez might be getting back together- to work on a song.
I thought she was dating someone else now.
She is, but they are on friendly terms nowadays The song was found on SoundCloud, but it turns out it's an old song they were working on before they split up, and it's unfinished.
How unfinished is it?
Justin has very few vocals, it's mostly Selena's lyrics laid down.
What's the song about?
It's called "Steal Our Love."
Oh, I doubt she would want to finish working on something like that if she's seeing someone else.
It would be really nice if they worked on it together, and Justin somehow managed to steal their love back.
I think he's grown up a little bit, they would probably do a lot better if they gave it a second chance.
