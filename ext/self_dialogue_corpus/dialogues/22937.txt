Have you seen the new Beauty and The Beast yet?
No, I haven't.
Me either but I really want to.
Yes, I just love  the story.
It really is a tale as old as time.
It's a classic for sure.
Disney really hyped it up in the media.
I do hope it is as good as everyone is saying.
I read the reviews on it, and they say Emma Watson was fabulous.
She really is a brilliant actress.
Didn't you like one of the actors in the film?
Yes, Luke Williams who plays Gaston.
Ah yes, he is so good at being bad.
He is the main reason I want to see the film, well that and the music.
Yes, the music is going to be phenomenal.
I cannot get Tale as Old as Time out of my head.
And the other characters are so cute like Mrs. Potts and Chip.
Yes!  I agree.
I wonder what the Beast's voice will sound like.
I'm sure it will be terrifying.
