Did you ever see Gone Girl?
I did.  It was okay, I guess.
You guess?  Don't sound like a huge fan.
I'm not really.  I just thought it was okay.
What did you like and dislike?
I thought the pacing was well-done as well as the general plot twist.
It was quite interesting how the story was written.
Right, the changing perspective.
In the end, they are both reprehensible characters in my opinion.
Absolutely.  Just like real life sometimes!
