I'm trying to pick out music for our road trip to Minneapolis tomorrow.
The one you're going on with Bill and Dave?
Yeah. I'm not sure what they'll like.
What do you have on it so far?
Well, I put on some nineties rock, and some stuff from the early 2000s. Daft Punk, that sort of thing.
I bet they'll like that.
Yeah. But now I'm stuck. Do you know what kind of music either of them likes?
Hmm. I'm not sure. A little bit of classic rock is usually a safe bet.
Like what?
Maybe The Rolling Stones?
That's such a throwback. It could be good though.
Yeah. And then maybe something you guys can get really into.
Hmm. I'm not sure we have anything like that in common.
What about that party where you guys all sang karaoke together?
What about it?
What song was it?
I think it was something by The Cranberries.
That's a safe bet then!
Okay! Oh, that's right. It was Zombie.
That's perfect.
