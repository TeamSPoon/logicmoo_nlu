Have you heard of the girl group Fifth Harmony?
Yeah, for sure! They were in X-Factor right?
Yeah, they didn't win but now they have more success than the winners.
I see how that could happen, i hear them on the radio all the time.
Have you heard their new music?
No, what's the song called?
The song is called Down and it is so catchy!
I'll give it a listen now.
What do you think?
I love the beat! But i could do without the rapping. Whose the rapper anyway?
That would be Gucci Mane.
Wow, that guy is still relevent?
Yeah, believe it or not!
I wish they would stop doing collabs, they are amazing alone.
I think they do that for more radio time.
True, Work featuring Ty Dolla Sign is one of their biggest hits.
Yeah, up until now they still perform it constantly.
Well can you blame them? That song is awesome.
Yeah, they are pretty great band.
Agreed! Can't wait for this new album.
