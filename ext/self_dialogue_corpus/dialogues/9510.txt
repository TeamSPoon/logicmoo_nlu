I wonder what happened to Iggy Azalea.
She just released a couple of singles.
Have you heard them?
I heard Mo Bounce and Switch. They aren't half bad.
The last I heard from her was that guest verse on the Britney track.
Pretty Girls? That was a bit of a mess.
Agreed. Are her new singles better?
Switch is really hard for Iggy, and Mo Bounce is more easy going.
Would you say they're worth the bucks on iTunes?
Maybe listen on Spotify first.
