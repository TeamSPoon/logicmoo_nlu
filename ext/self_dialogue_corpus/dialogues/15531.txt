Do you like Teddy?
Teddy who?
Teddy Pendergrass.
Man of course. Teddy was my dude. I love his music.
Me too. I like that one The More I get The More I Want.
That's a classic. You know he's the panty-bull.
What you mean?
Women would be at his concerts and they would start throwing their panties onto the stage.
That's 'cause Teddy would sing Turn Off The Lights and them women would go crazy.
Between Turn Off The Lights and then Close The Door.
I forgot about Close The Door.
I even like the one he made after he got paralyzed and made a comeback.
You're talking about Joy.
Yeah, Joy, that's it.
I like all of Teddy's music. Even when he was with Harold Melvin and them.
You talking about Harold Melvin and The Blue Notes.
Yeah. Them dudes had that classic Philly sound.
I know. But Harold Melvin was jealous because Teddy was getting all of the shine.
And that's why Teddy went solo.
I know right. Rest in peace Teddy.
