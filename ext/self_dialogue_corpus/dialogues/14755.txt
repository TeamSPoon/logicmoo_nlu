Do you remember Clueless?
Yes! That movie was hilarious!
I agree. Alicia Silverstone was great as a snotty teenager. As was Stacey Dash.
But it's so funny how stuck in the 1990s it is.
Yeah, but the Breakfast Club has the same issue I guess.
So will Mean Girls in a decade or two.
But a good teen comedy is timeless in its own way.
Agreed. I still bust a gut when I watch Clueless.
That said, the ending was a little icky.
I know! She starts dating her former step-brother!
