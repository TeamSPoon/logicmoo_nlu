Are you watching the NBA playoffs?
Yeah, I can't believe the Cavaliers are sweeping their way through the East.
Do you think any team can stop them?
I think the only team that has a chance in the East is Boston.
I think so too. Isaiah Thomas is putting on quite a performance.
What do you think about the Western Conference?
I'm a big fan of the San Antonio Spurs, but they're having a bit of trouble with the Houston Rockets.
How about the Golden State Warriors?
Hopefully the Spurs can give them a hard time. They're just such a good team.
How are you supposed to stop that team?
Especially since they picked up Kevin Durant in the off-season last year.
It's starting to look like another Finals rematch.
Yeah, I think in the end we're going to see the Warriors play the Cavaliers again.
Who do you think is gonna take it all?
I think the Warriors are gonna win this year.
How come?
I think if you compare the teams side by side, the Warriors are just better in almost every way.
I think LeBron can give them a run for their money. He's carried Cleveland before.
There's only one way to find out.
I can't wait for the Finals!
