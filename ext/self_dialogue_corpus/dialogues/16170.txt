Do you think it is harder to find good music these days?
I don't know, I hadn't really thought about it. What do you mean?
I just feel like it all sounds the same pop with hip-hop influences.
Well, then I'd say you aren't looking in the right place! There's a lot of great alternative music right now.
Oh really. I guess I'm not familiar with that genre.
I really like Cold War Kids, but you have Modest Mouse, Kings of Leon, Cage the Elephant, and so many more!
Yeah, I've heard of none of them!
I found most of them on Youtube.
How did you find them?
I started with the song First by Cold War Kids and Youtube automatically made me a playlist of songs like it.
That's a nice feature.
It really is. I found so much music I wouldn't have known about otherwise, like Twenty-One Pilots.
Now them, I've heard of. I don't think I could tell you any of their songs though.
Well, a lot of people know the song Heathens because it was in Suicide Squad, but their other stuff is as good or better.
So if you like that type of music do you like that folk/alternative sound too.
Yes! So much. I love Mumford and Sons, Of Monsters and Men, and the Civil Wars.
I know Mumford and Sons but not the others.
The Civil Wars was a duo, but unfortunately they broke up.
That's too bad.
It is because their voices together were hauntingly beautiful.
