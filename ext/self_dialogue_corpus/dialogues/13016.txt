I just saw Star Wars IV.
Wow, the first Star Wars.  Who was your favorite character?
Carrie Fisher as Princess Leia.
Mine was Harrison Ford as Han Solo.
I liked the Death Star storyline.
The Obi-Wan Jedi business was cool too.
I thought it was silly to use light sabers.
Yes, very hokey.
Darth Vader was mysterious and dark.
I liked how he got away, getting ready for the next movie.
