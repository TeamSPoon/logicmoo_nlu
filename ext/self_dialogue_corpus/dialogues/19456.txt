Have you heard that new Sam Hunt song?
No, I don't even know who Sam Hunt is.  What is it?
Body Like a Back Road.  It's a great song!
What kind of music is it?
Well technically I guess it's country, but it's got a great beat and a little bit of rock influence I'd say.
So it's kinda a mixture of country and pop?
Yeah you could definitely say that.
So who on earth is Sam Hunt?
He's a country singer, just not as big of a name as some.
Oh, yeah I don't listen to much country.  That's probably why I don't know him.
Well I'm surprised you haven't heard his new one.  It's been a Billboard number one song for twenty weeks.
Wow, on which Billboard list?
Well, country hits.  Maybe that's why you haven't heard it.
Yeah, I bet.  I do like to keep up with Billboard hits, though.
Sam Hunt actually has released two albums already.
Oh yeah? Was anything else a hit?
Not that I know of.  He was new to me with this song.
Well I'll definitely check it out.
Yeah, it has great lyrics and a good beat.  I bet you'll like it.
Thanks for the recommendation, I will definitely let you know!
