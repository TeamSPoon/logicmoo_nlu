I'm going to a movie this afternoon.
Oh really? Which one?
I'm not sure yet. I usually like to see independent films.
Yeah, me too.
The blockbuster ones seem to all be special effects and fighting and no real story anymore.
Yeah, I used to see a lot of movies, but I don't go so much anymore for that same reason.
I've noticed the same thing lately. It's like they've run out of ideas.
Ha ha. Yes, it seems all they release lately are sequels to older movies.
It gets old after a while. Have you seen any good independent type films this year?
Yes, I liked Norman a lot.
I haven't heard of that. Who is in it?
Richard Gere.
Oh, I love him. What was it about?
It was about a man who is all about connections and doing favors for people so that he can get favors back.
Kind of like Kramer from Seinfeld?
Yes, except he lied a lot to keep up this fake front of being successful, but he was basically homeless.
Sounds interesting.
It was interesting since the movie really developed the character.
I love movies like that.
Yes, a lot better than the typical superhero movie.
