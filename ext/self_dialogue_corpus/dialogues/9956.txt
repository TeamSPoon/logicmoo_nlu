Did you ever see Hung Fu Hustle?
Yes, thats such a great movie.
Yeah, I love the fight scenes in that movie, they are so original.
Who directed it?
Stephen Chow, he also plays Sing in the movie.
I didn't know that.  Did he also direct Kung Fu Hustle 2?
I don't remember.  They only released it on You Tube?
Thats the modern day version of releasing a movie straight to VHS.
Ha, I guess it is cause i never saw it.
Yeah, its better that way, the orginal was the best anyway.
