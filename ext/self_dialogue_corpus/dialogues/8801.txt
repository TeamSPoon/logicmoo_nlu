Hey I was thinking about old bands from the 70's....Queen.
I love Queen. Freddie Mercury had such an incredible voice.
His range was unbelievable, right?
Yeah, you would be hard pressed to find anybody with that range.
Amazing... no doubt. I love Bohemian Rhapsody.
I remember Another One Bites The Dust.
We Will Rock You.
They had such incredible music.
I know. They were so innovative and creative.
Yeah, I think they went all out for their music. Got to be one of the best bands of all time. Better than the Beatles.
