Do you think a 2000 yard season from a wide receiver is possible?
No I think thats way too lofty.
Its a passing league now.
But who could get that many receptions?
Odell Beckham could.
Yeah but you would have to average almost 130 yards a game.
You dont think thats hard?
I mean when you break it down like that no its not hard.
So why dont you think more guys do that
Cause getting to 130 is hard enough.
Guys produce like that all the time
Yeah but then they disappear like that
You dont think in todays game Jerry Rice could do that?
He may be able to
So the QB targets him more, it opens up other guys
Yeah but then you have backs tearing it up for 200 yards rushing
Then when they single cover the receiver he gets his
I wish it worked like that
May be we do see it before long
If they extend the season, yeah
