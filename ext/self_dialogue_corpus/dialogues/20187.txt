Do you like to watch movies?
Yes, I do. What is your favorite type of movie?
My favorite type of movie is horror.
Oh! I like horror movies too.
Really? Which one is your favorite?
I like The Shining.
Ah! The Shining is a classic. I like The Thing the best!
What is The Thing about?
It is about an alien creature invading a science complex.
Sounds neat. Is it scary?
No, it is just interesting and thrilling.
Sounds awesome. I'd like to see it sometime.
Have you ever seen a horror movie sequel that was better than the original?
Not really. Usually the sequels aren't as good as the original.
I agree. I wonder why sequels aren't as good.
I think it is because they don't have as much material to work with.
It is too bad that movies work that way.
Yeah, I think that the corporations are to blame.
Regardless, there are lots of movies for us to watch!
Yes, let's watch one together sometime.
