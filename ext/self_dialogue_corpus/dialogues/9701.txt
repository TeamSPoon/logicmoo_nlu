Do you think Rap and Hip-Hop today is the same as it used to be?
No way.  Gone are the days of EPMD.  Nas is still out there, not making music so much but still on point.
I know.  I loved EPMD.  Strictly Business and You Gots to Chill were my joints!
Yeah, but what about Public Enemy?  Remember the LP Fear of A Black Planet?  Now that was dope!
Oh yeah, they were on point too.
Do you remember the song, Fight The Power?  And what about Boogie Down Productions, KRS-One?
Fight The Power was a national anthem.  KRS-one is trying to educate now.  Too bad rappers today are still in the dark, sheep as it were.
Yeah, they mostly rap about nonsense.  Money, drugs, and degrading women.  There are a few decent ones though...
Do you think we'll ever get back to conscious rap and real hip-hop?
I doubt it.  It's a whole new ballgame now.  It's all about the money.
