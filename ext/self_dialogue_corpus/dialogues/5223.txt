What was the best of the modern Disney films?
I'd make a case for Finding Nemo.
That was a classic.
Truly. I think Albert Brooks really sold that movie.
He was awesome. But the whole cast was good.
Yeah, Willem Dafoe was Gill; he was excellent as always.
Right, and Allison Janey was Peach.
She has a very distinct voice.
That what makes for a great animated film. That and the writing.
It was some stirring stuff.
