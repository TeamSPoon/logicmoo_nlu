Did you catch that new Wolverine movie?
I did not. What was it called again? Something different, I know.
"Logan!"
Ahh, that is right.
Yeah, it was great.
Was it action-packed?
Definitely. And Hugh Jackman did an excellent job.
I'll have to go check it out for sure.
Heck, I'd go see it again. Just let me know.
Sounds good. You know I love some Wolverine!
