Do you know who Stromae is?
No, I've never heard of him.
He's a French guy. A rapper. You should check him out.
How'd you find out about this guy?
I had a French teacher who was into him. He's huge in France. Honestly, though, people are starting to catch onto him here.
Huh. Does he have videos and stuff?
Oh, yeah. I mean, they're high production and everything. The US isn't the only place for good music, man.
I know! I just never heard of him, is all.
You gotta get out in the world. Go to college or something.
Yeah, I know. Stromae. I'll check him out.
