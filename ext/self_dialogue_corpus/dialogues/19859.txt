I read today that music is getting more repetitive and unoriginal these days.
Where'd you read that?
An article in Paste Magazine.
Did it have a bunch of graphs to analyze the instrumentation, lyric repetition, and harmonies by decade?
Yes, you read it too.
Look at the author name.
Oh my god. You wrote that???
Very good. Any questions about it?
Why did you write this article?
Well, lots of old people and hipsters are claiming music isn't as good these days because of those reasons.
Is what you found true?
Sort of. With Progressive Rock in the 70s, there was a huge variety of instruments being worked with.
What about lyrics?
Yes, they are more repetitive, but that's not a bad thing.
Why not?
Think about the standard strophic form used in church and art music.
Where the piece is basically repeated a few times with new lyrics?
Yep.
Oooooh, I get it.
It's nothing new to modern times. The only thing new is that it takes 12 people to write a song instead of 1.
