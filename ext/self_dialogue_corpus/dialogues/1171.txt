This should be an exciting NFL season, shouldn't it?
Definitely, who is your favorite team?
Oh the Dallas Cowboys for sure.
You should be excited, the Cowboys have gotten better and have an exciting young quarterback.
Yes I love Dak Prescott, and the offensive line is one of the best in the league.
Maybe this is the Cowboys year to go all the way?
Maybe, but I don't want to get my hopes up too much!  Who is your favorite team?
For me it's the New England Patriots.
Well, you've had a lot to cheer about the last 15 years or so.
Yes, we've been spoiled.  Tom Brady has been probably the best quarterback ever.
Not to mention Bill Belichick may be the best coach ever.
No doubt, without him none of this would have happened.
Do you think Brady will play a lot longer?
He has said he wants to play at least 5 more years, I wouldn't put it past him.
That would put him close to his mid 40s, has that ever happened?
I don't think anyone has played at a high level at that age.
Well, either way I think Garoppolo will be ready, they've been grooming him for years now.
I sure hope so because Brady won't be playing forever.
I'm sure the Patriots will be fine either way.  Good luck to you and the Patriots this year!
Same to you and the Cowboys!
