I like collecting movie soundtracks.
Oh, cool.
Yeah, I like both the albums, and the scores of the films.
I can understand why. Some movies have really beautiful music.
Exactly why I collect them. Harry Gregson-Williams is one of the best film composers in my opinion.
I think he's a bit overrated. Same with Hans Zimmer.
Hans Zimmer did the score for the Batman films, and those were great.
But before him Danny Elfman did the score for the older Batman movies, and those were better.
I don't know about that, but I do know music is an important part of movies.
True. I think movies are mainly two components, the visual and the audio.
But what about silent films? Don't those count?
I forgot all about silent films! Yeah, they count.
So then I guess movies are just all about the visuals, huh?
Well, no, I still think the sound is an important part of movies. Just not everything, I guess.
Well, I agree. Like I said, I collect movie soundtracks, but no, music isn't everything.
Even when it comes to audio, there are things like sound effects, and the mixing which is important.
Yeah, so many little things combine to make a great movie.
It's a wonder any movies get made at all.
I guess even for bad films the stars had to align just right for it to get made at all.
You're probably right. I could never be a movie maker; too much work.
