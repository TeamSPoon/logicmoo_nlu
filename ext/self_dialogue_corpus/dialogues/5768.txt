What's your favorite Disney movie?
That's hard, let me think about it. Well, I like a few: Aladdin, Mary Poppins, and Alice in Wonderland.
What do you like about Aladdin?
The music and the genie--the genie is awesome!
Did you see any of the sequels?
Yeah, did you?
Yeah, but not in a really long time.
How many were there, three?
I think so. I don't remember them as much as the original, which I've probably seen a hundred times!
I think I've seen it a thousand times!
