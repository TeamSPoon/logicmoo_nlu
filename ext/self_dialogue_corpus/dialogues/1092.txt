So the winningest QB for the superbowl is Brady?
Yes. He's gone to 7 and won 5.
Which ones did he lose?
He lost in consecutive apperances in 08 and 12. Both against Eli Manning and the giants.
That's gotta sting
A Giants and Patriots rematch in superbowl is a must. We have to see it
Who will win if that does happen?
Who knows, if it doesn't happen this year, we're talking Brady in his 40s.
Whoa. Brady is 40 already?
He's 39, but the superbowl will be next year, so he will be 40, but if it doesn't happen this season, we're talking about brady being 41 and older
I wonder who the oldest QB ever to win the superbowl.
Easy. Peyton Manning. The 50th superbowl last year. He was 39
Who's the second oldest?
Elway, he held thast record until Mannning took it away. Elway was 38.
That's funny Elway owns the Broncos.
Yeah, but it's a good your team won tough, so losing a record isn't really a big deal.
Yeah, Guess so. So, wait if Brady is 39 now, and then he was 38 uring the last superbowl?
Yep. He doesn't have too many years left.
I wish he'd go this year and at least tie Manning's record
That would be a sight to see.
