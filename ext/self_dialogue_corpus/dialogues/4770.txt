Did you catch the Los Angeles game last night?
I went to bed early. Did I miss anything good?
Did you ever.
What happened?
They cleared the benches in Los Angeles.
What? Why?
Ross Stripling hit Stanton with a throw.
What? He's got some nerve to be doing that.
I 100% would have thrown at anyone other than Stanton, dude is  massive.
Tell me about it. He towers over everyone on the field.
I think he lost a lot of his nerve when he saw Stanton wasn't dropping his bat though.
I would too. Stanton is  6'6".
You should have seen Stanton stalking towards the mound with a bat. I would have been  terrifed.
Nah, I don't think so.
You don't think so? Dude, Stanton is huge!
I know. That's why I know you wouldn't be stupid enough to pick a fight with someone who nearly has a foot of height on you.
Definitely. My mother didn't raise and idiot.
Reminds me of when a young Porcello accidentally hit Youkilis and for no reason whatsoever Youk charged the mound and an incredibly confused, and skinny Porcello used all that weight moving in his direction to just throw Youk to the ground.
That's  one of my favorite charging the mound moments in baseball.
I'd be scared out of my mind if Stanton started walking towards me like that. I wouldn't know what to do except to either run or try to apologize.
