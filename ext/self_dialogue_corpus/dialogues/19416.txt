Have you ever heard Maggie Rodgers
No who is that
well its this girl that got famous after Pharell went to her school to hear her song and it was so good he almost cried
what type of music do you do
well she said she started off real heavy in folf i think but then took a trip somewhere and got influced by other sounds to me it kind of sounds like pop
whats the song i want to look it up
The first one I heard was called Alaska you can find it on youtube
ok im going to have to do that so is she like a one hit wonder you think
I dont think so when you look at her she looks like this lady out the 70s you automatically think you would not like her music but when you jer her sound starting with her voice its something speacial
oh wow so what happened after the video did she get a record deal
i dont know if she had one already or not from what i understand she was in school and was taking a master class about music
I wonder is she signed to pharrels label is he even still has a label
I forgot he had a label wasnt it called startrek or something like that
yeah i think it was
oh okay yeah im looking her up on my phone  now she also has a song called on and off have you heard that one
yeah that one is cool but i like her first one better maybe when i get tired of that one ill give it another chance
its crasy how she became a star over night over a song that she made last minute so she wouldnt fail a class
yes it is
you have to watch that video so you can see pharell face he was so shocked by how good it was he counldnt contain hisself
hld on im bout to watch it now
