Who is your favorite pop singer?
I really like Ed Sheeran, but the radio plays some of his songs too much.
That's for sure.  Every time I turn on the radio, they are playing Shape of You.
Exactly!  Now they have started on Castle on the Hill.
His music is great though.
I really wanted to go to his concert last year, but I couldn't.
When was it?
It was in Tulsa the day before Mother's Day.
Bummer.  That would have been a great concert.
Maybe we can get tickets to his show in Dallas.
