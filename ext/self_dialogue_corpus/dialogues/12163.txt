What is your favorite star wars movie?
I like the Phantom Menace the best
Yes, Darth Maul was really cool.
I love Jar-Jar Binks
Jar-Jar Binks is perhaps the best character in the Star Wars Universe
I love how clumsy he is when attempting to do the most normal things.
My favorite thing is the way that he talks when he says things like "Meesa"
Me too! Man, Jar-Jar is the best
I also like the introduction of Senator Palpatine
Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis The Wise?
