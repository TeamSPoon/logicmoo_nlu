Caddy Shack has to be one of the best movies ever.
Never saw it.
It is a comedy from the early eighties.
That is old. Really it is funny?
Yes, I actually watched it recently and it wa still really funny.
Who is in it?
Chevy Chase is the lead character.
Who else?
Bill Murray is also in it, plays a crazy grounds keeper.
Grounds keeper?
yes.
Is it a golf movie?
Sure is!
Really and it is funny?
It kind of mocks the country club thing, really well done.
And that is funny?
That and the floating baberuth candy bar in the pool that the life guard thinks is a poop in the pool.
Funny?
To Jaws music. You will just have to see it.
Or take your word for it.
