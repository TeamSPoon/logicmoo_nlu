I didnt expect Deadpool to be a decent movie
It was like an anti superhero movie
Yea, but still had hero elements to it
And it was rated R, which allowed them to take it further.
I liked all the cursing in it.
It helped make the movie unique, yea.
I think I will be waiting outside the theaters for deadpool 2.
Yes, I will come with you!!
And maybe even buy and wear the mask
I'll find his swords, but I don't think I can get them past security.
