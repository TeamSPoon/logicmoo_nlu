Who's your favorite character on Star Wars?
I really like Master Yoda.
Yeah, he was awesome.  So small but powerful.
And Frank Oz was brilliant as Yoda.
He was.  He speaks a little odd though.
Yeah, so wise but can't seem to put a sentence together.
I loved his fight scenes though.
Yeah, right before he came in I was just thinking how awesome Yoda might be.
We were not disappointed either.
Nope, he's a stud with a light saber.
