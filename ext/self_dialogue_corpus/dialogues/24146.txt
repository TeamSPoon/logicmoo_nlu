yeah a long time ago
its my favorite horror movie
yeah it was pretty good, the rest were lame though
no, i thought they were great!
really?
yeah, they all connect and make the plot really thick.
i never thought of that, i stopped after the 2nd
no you have to get to at least the 3rd when you find out who the characters really are
oh, well maybe ill rewatch them
you really should, although the first is hard to beat
yeah that ending was insane
oh for sure, definitely one of the best endings to a horror I've ever seen
seriously, i did not expect him to get up at all

and the characters were believable too.
