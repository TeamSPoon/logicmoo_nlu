It's almost football season!
Yeah, it's coming in a couple of months.
Do you think the Texan's are going to do it this year?
I don't know, but they should have a good team.
Yes they do. They got a new quarterback.
That's what I heard. Have you seen him.
I've seen him on TV, but just talking. I haven't seen him play.
He's a rookie just out of college, right?
Yeah, but they say he's pretty good.
Is Savage still on the team?
I think so. He'll probably be backup quarterback.
I think that they have to try out for starter position.
Oh yeah. That's what the preseason games are for.
I never watch those.
Yeah, me neither.
When do the real games start?
The first Thursday after Labor day.
When is the Texan's first real game?
The first Sunday after Labor Day, against the Jaguars.
I hate the Jaguars.
