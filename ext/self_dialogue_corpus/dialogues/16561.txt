I listen to a lot of Irish folk music.
Oh, so do I. I love it.
Irish music is good in general.
I agree. It's so full of tradition.
They have a great channel on Pandora you might like.
What's it called?
Irish Pub Radio.
Oh, cool. I am going to check it out.
They play rock but it's ifluenced by folk stuff.
That sounds so awesome.
It is. They play a lot of Darby O'Gill and I like him.
I've never heard of him.
He's funny.
I'll look him up and I'll check on that channel on Pandora.
I'm sure you'll love Darby's stuff.
I usually like your music recommendations.
Check out Flogging Molly too.
I've heard of them. They're great.
They're played a lot on that channel.
I can't wait to hear all of this.
