So I have a movie question for you and it is kind of hard.
Oh go ahead, it can't be that hard.
What is your favorite movie of all time?
What? No, you can't ask that.
Fine-from our lifetime.
Well, that doesn't narrow it down as much as I would like, but I would have to choose the Harry Potter series.
Okay, that's a series, not a movie. Pick one.
Nit pickey, aren't we? Okay, I like the first one.
Why do you like that one the best?
I like how much they showcase how magical everything is.
It does make you want to kind of jump into their world.
I think they do the best in that movie of really leaving you with a sense of awe of how great and majestic Hogwarts is.
I really like that one, but I really like The Goblet of Fire.
I like that one too, of course. But why that one?
I really enjoy the dance scene. The scenery is beautiful.
I like the plot of that one.
Me too. Who is your favorite character from the movies?
I really like Harry, but Ron cracks me up.
Ron is funny, but I like Hermione. She is very witty.
That is why they make a good couple!
