Who would win if Luke fough Darth Maul.
Is this legends canon or Disney?
It's Disney canon.
Maul would win then.
Maul, how would he win?
Luke really doesn't have any feats.  At best, he beat Vader, who didn't want to win and was taking a dive.
And Maul was killed by Obi-Wan, who Vader beat.
After killed Qui-Gon Jin, who was better than Obi-Wan.  Obi-Wan got lucky.
He also lost to Palpatine, Luke didn't.
Luke was being electrocuted to death. That's a loss.
