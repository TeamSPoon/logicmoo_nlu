Who is your favorite NFL team?
I am a big Carolina Panthers fan!
How long have you liked them?
Since they came to Charlotte over 10 years ago.
They went to the super bowl a few years ago didn't they?
Hell yeah they did?  They should have won it.
Their quarterback Cam Newton is really good.
He's a little eccentric but he's a hell of a football player.
Are you guys going to be good this year?
I think we have a chance to have a pretty good team. We made some moves in the off-season and got better.
I heard you guys picked Julius peppers up.
Yes, he played for us years ago and now we've got him back.
Any other team  that you pull for?
I pulled for the Seattle Seahawks because of Russell Wilson.
Are you a big fan of his?
Sorta, my bill for him because he went to my almamater, NSCU.
That's pretty cool. Any other team do you like?
I'll pull for the Colts as well because my wife is from Indianapolis.
Have you ever been to an NFL game?
I've been to a couple Carolina Panthers game. It is a lot of fun to go to a live game
