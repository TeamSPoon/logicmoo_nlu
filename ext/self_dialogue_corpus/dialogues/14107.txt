What was your first Lady gaga song?
I heard her through Bad romance
oh really? what did you think of her then
Honestly, I wasn't a fan at first I thought she was weird
what was weird about her?
mostly her costumes and the way she presents herself
I can see how that can be a turnoff
but i still like her music
What is your favorite current song
I do love The Cure
