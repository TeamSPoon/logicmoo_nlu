So, what do you think of the NLF Hall of Fame class for 2018?
Some interesting names, I think Ray Lewis and Steve Hutchinson are the only first balloters.
You don't have Randy Moss as first ballot?
No, he's close but there is such a logjam at wide receivers.  If Owens doesn't make it I don't see how Moss does.
The Owens thing was for off the court behavior, and besides Moss was better at his prime.  He'll get in.
Do you think Owens ever gets in?
Definitely, I am not sure how often two players of the same position get in the same year though, so he may have to wait even longer.
That hurts Urlacher too.  He played the same position as Ray Lewis.
Yup, besides he is not quite a first balloter to me anyway.  But he will get in.  Who else do you have?
I think Ronde Barber gets in eventually, but he will have to wait?
And what about Richard Seymour?
Going to be tough for him.  His style of play didn't really create the sacks, and people will forget how he changed the flow of a game.
Do you think Tagliabue will get in?
No idea.  An argument can be made just to include every commissioner.  Probably not this year though.
Who else do you think will get in?
Not sure, how many slots are there anyway?
There is no firm number, but somewhere between 4 to 8 players.
In that case I think Tony Boselli and Faneca also makes it.
Boselli might deserve it as a player, but I hated him as an annoucer.
Yeah, he was pretty bad.
