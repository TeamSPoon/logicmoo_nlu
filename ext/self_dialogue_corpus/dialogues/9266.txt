Have  you heard much  from Lupe  ?
I heard  his  Lazerz   track  which is  good .
the  whole  cd is well put  together .
how    many  tracks  are there ?
there  are only  10 tracks  but they all  have a  message
Would  you  go see  him in  concert?
I think  he would  put on  a great  show  .
Who  would  you  compare  to lyrically ?
I would  compare  him  to  bone  thugs
I might  just  have to  listen  to  more of  his  stuff
