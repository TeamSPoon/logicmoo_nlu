Do you like old musical movies?
It depends, most of the time I do.
How do you feel about South Pacific?
I love that one! The songs are so catchy and the acting is so great!
Who is your favorite character?
I like Bloody Mary.
Oh yeah, her character is very interesting.
She is Liat's mother right? It has been awile since I have seen it.
Yes, she is. She tries to fix her up with Lt. Cable.
That's right. But I really do enjoy that movie.
Have you seen any newer musicals?
Hairspray comes to mind. Have you seen that one?
I have. I like it.
You don't seem to enthusiastic about it.
I mean, I like it. I just think it is missing something that older movies have.
I can see that. But, I still think it is a good movie.
Oh I still think it is good. I really like the plot and the window into how life was in that time.
That is one of my favorite things about movies. I like to see how life was or is in places or times different than my own.
I enjoy that about movies too. It is much better than reading about it in a textbook.
Well, here is to educational, but entertaining movies!
