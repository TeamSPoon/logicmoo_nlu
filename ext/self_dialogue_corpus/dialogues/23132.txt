You know what movie I just watched?
No, what?
Arachnaphobia!  That's such a scary movie.
Oh whatever!  It didn't scare me at all.
You weren't scared by the spiders?  Gosh, I can't get them out of my mind.
No, I thought they were absurd.  Nothing like that really exists.
Well it scared me.  They were huge.
Unrealistically so!  The whole movie was silly.
I didn't think so.  There are some pretty big spiders out there.
I thought it was silly.  Plus the plot was weak.
You thought so? I found it to be suspenseful.
Nahh.  That movie came out back in 1990 right?
Yeah.  It's almost thirty years old.
That's probably why it's so lame.  The special effects were weak back then.
I thought they were pretty good for being so old.
No.  Imagine if they did a remake!  That would be horrifying.
It wouldn't be as good as the original.  Plus John Goodman is great.
I don't care for him much.
Well geez, you really hated the movie didn't you!
I told you it's not one of my favorites.
