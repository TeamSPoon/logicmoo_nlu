Who is your favorite director?
I would say Stanley Kubrick.
Why would you say Kubrick?
Because it he was able to really master any genre that he attempted and many of his movies are my all-time favorites.
Like which movies?
2001: A Space Odyssey, Barry Lyndon, The Shining, and A Clockwork Orange, to name a few.
I like Kubrick but I feel that he often got wooden performances from his actors and actresses.
That's a fair criticism.
As an example, I found the acting in Eyes Wide Shut to be quite mechanical and cold.
I would agree. You chose the movie that best supports your opinion. I think his productions often dwarfed an actor or actresses performances.
If you are agreeing with me then I find it hard to believe that he is your favorite director.
Well, I also think he got great performances as well. Take Ryan O'Neal's performance in Barry Lyndon - it may be the best in his career.
Well, yeah, but so many of the other leads in his films were quite wooden, cold, and mechanical.
I would prefer the term stylized and mannered, but it often fit the script or the overall mood of his films.
You aren't going to win me over in the Kubrick department. I'm much more of a fan of director's that get more human performances.
Again... you are not alone in your opinion, but I think you are putting Kubrick in a very narrowly defined box.
What sort of box?
That a director's worth is based solely on achieving human, warm, or realistic performances from the actors he or she uses.
That's true.
Perhaps we should define criteria with which to evaluate great directors.
