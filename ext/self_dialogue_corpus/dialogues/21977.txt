Did you watch Boyhood?
Oh, yes, I loved it! I can't believe it didnt win the Academy Award for Best Picture.
Me too! It was way better than Birdman!
That was really awesome that they filmed it over 12-13 years.
Yeah, I really identified with it a lot I think because you kind of process what it is like watching the same characters age in real time.
I thought it was better than Before Midnight.
Yeah I thought Before Midnight wasn't that great. But I really Like Before Sunrise and Before Sunset.
Yes, those are two of my favorite movies. I got excited when I saw Ethan Hawke in Boyhood.
Oh, did you think he was playing Jesse?
Yes! At first I thought this was the family he left behind for Celine. But there was a daughter, which wasn't the case for Jesse.
I thought the same too. I wouldnt have been surprised if Richard Linklater had made that the case.
Yeah, but I guess he wanted Boyhood to be its own, special thing.
Yeah. Patricia Arquette was really good.
Yeah I haven't seen her in anything for years. I didnt know she was still acting.
What other movies is she in?
True Romance, Lost Highway, and probably more I can't think of.
Oh, I havent seen those movies?
They are both good. Not as good as Boyhood, but entertaining.
Isn't Lost Highway a David Lynch film?
Yes. It is really trippy, as you would expect!
