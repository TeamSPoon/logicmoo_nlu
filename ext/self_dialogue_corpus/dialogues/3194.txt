The NFL season is getting really close!
I can not wait to go watch the Indianapolis Colts play!
Do you plan on going to a lot of their games this year?
Yea, my wife and I usually go to three or four home games each year.
I have not been back ever since they cut ties with Peyton Manning.
I hated their decision to do that. I wish that management would have handled that situation differently.
I think they just did it to get Andrew Luck in the draft that year.
You are probably right about that actually.
I still can not find it in my heart to forgive the franchise for that.
So, you are not a Colts fan anymore?
Nope! I quit watching them all together after they did that to Manning.
Wow, I do not think I could ever do that for any reason!
Manning done so much for this franchise, I could not believe they would just let him go the way they did.
I know what you mean, I loved Peyton myself and did not feel he was done right by the organization.
What made me really mad was the fact that he still had a few really good years left in him.
I feel that he should have been able to retire as a Colt.
While he was winning a Superbowl with Denver, the Colts did not even make the playoffs.
Yea it has pretty much been a struggle for us ever since he left.
Maybe one day I can find it in my heart to forgive and forget, but not yet.
I hope so, I know how much you love the Colts deep down.
