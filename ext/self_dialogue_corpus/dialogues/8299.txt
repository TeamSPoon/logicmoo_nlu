You know what's funny?
What?
I really try not to like Justin Bieber's music and I actually like a lot of it. I wish he didn't sing pop music so I wouldn't hear it on the radio all the time.
I understand how a lot of people are turned off by his personality.
That's exactly my problem, but I like a lot of his music.
I thought he was done being popular but then he came back in 2015 and released that song Sorry and I knew that was going to be a big hit.
I have to admit, I do like the album Sorry is on. That one is named Purpose right?
Yes, that album is Purpose and it also has What Do You Mean and Love Yourself on there as well.
Is that his fourth album?
Yes, plus he's done a ton of collaborations with other artists on their records, like DJ Snake and too many others to name.
