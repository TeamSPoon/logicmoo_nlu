Do you like rappers from any particular area?
I really like west coast guys and guys from the south.
That's cool, who are some of your favorites?
Guys like The Game and Lil Wayne.
Nice, I'm a big Lil Wayne fan as well.
Do you like his new or old stuff?
Mostly his older stuff like the songs off the carter 2.
There are so many classics on that album.
I also really like some of his collaborations with guys like eminem and young jeezy.
I'm with you, he does a great job on almost everything he does.
