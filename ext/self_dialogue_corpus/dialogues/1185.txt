Hey, what do you think about football?
Oh I love it!
Oh, yea?
Yea I love watching them kick that ball!
Dude, I mean American Football.  As in the NFL...
Ohhhh!  Yea I like that too!
Oh yea?
Yea, what's your favorite team?
The Patriots!
The Patriots are terrible!
Terrible!?  How so!?
They always mess things up?
Mess things up?  Like how?
Like they're the worst team in the NFL!
How can you say that?  They won the Super Bowl last year!
How does that make them good?
It's the championship of the NFL?
Yea I really don't watch American Football!
Why did you lie?
For the fun of it!
