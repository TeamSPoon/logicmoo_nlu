Corinne Bailey Rae has such an incredible voice.  Do you know her?
No, what does she sing?
She's a British singer, she has a really soulful voice.  Her most famous song is probably, "Put Your Records On".  Do you know it?
You mean the one that goes, "Girl, put your records on, tell me your favorite song"...something about "let your hair down"?
Yes, that's the one.  She has only made a few albums but the songs she's written are so good.
She must be more well-known in the U.K..
Yeah, she is, but I think she has a big U.S. following.  The last time she came here, her show was sold out.
Does she sing jazz as well?
She has.  She did a duet with Herbie Hancock of Joni Mitchell's "River".
Really?  I love that song.  I'd like to hear it.
Yeah, Herbie's piano is fantastic.
I will check that song out.
You should really check out all of her music.  My favorite song by her is called, "Like a Star."
Has she won any awards?
Yes, I think she won a grammy for best R& B performance for one of her songs, the one about her husband.  I can't remember what it's called.
Is her husband someone famous?
He's a musician, and he passed away in 2010.   I think her last album was about his death, very spooky, sad songs.
Wow, sounds kind of depressing.
It isn't really, because her voice is so beautiful and she writes really good music.
I will give her a listen.
