What did you think of the accountant?
Which one was that again?
Ben Affleck's recent thriller, he was a hit-man.
Oh right, that one was incredible.
I want a trailer like that one day.
You and everybody else, I just want a painting like that over my bed.
My favorite scene was when he was shooting the cantaloupes on the farm.
They faces he drew on there made me laugh.
I liked it because of the farmer watching him, the look on his face when he hit them.
He was definitely in shock, then Affleck just waves at him like nothing even happened.
