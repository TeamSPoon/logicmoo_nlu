So what do you think of the Packers this year?
I'm really excited. The new tight ends are going to make the offense unstoppable.
I completely agree. Martellus Bennett is an animal.
Yeah! And don't forget about Lance Kendricks either!
Yeah, I really liked him when he played for the Wisconsin Badgers.
Yup! And he's been sneaky good in St. Louis and Los Angeles the last few years.
Yeah, and that was with terrible quarterbacks!
Yup. Imagine what he is going to do with Aaron Rogers instead of Jared Goff! Ha!
Yup. Once you come to think about it, he's not all that different than Jared Cook was last year. Comes from a bad QB situation and is athletic as heck!
Man you are getting me excited. Teams are not going to be able to defend the Packers.
Yup. Like I think Bennett is superior to JerMichael Finley and remember what the offense was like with him? This is going to be awesome.
Yeah, the Packers were even unstoppable last year with Jared Cook, who was not even as good as Finley.
Rodgers is so good when he has a TE to stretch the field in the middle. It just opens up Jordy even more as well.
Man, if we have a running game, we could set offensive records.
Totally. And between Montgomery and the three rookies, I think we'll be completely fine.
I cant believe Lacy left to go to Seattle.
I can. He probably was angry at Mike McCarthy for always caring about his weight.
Well didn't you see the rumors he was approaching 270 from Bob McGinn of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel? The Seahawks even put a weight provision in his contract.
Wow. Has he had to weigh in for the Seahawks yet?
Yup. He's passed them so far, but that was the same last year when he was with the Pack.
