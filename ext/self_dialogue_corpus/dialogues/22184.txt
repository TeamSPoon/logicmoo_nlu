You see 'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2' yet?
Yes, I loved it so much!  How about you?
I thought it was okay.
Just okay?
It wasn't as special or as original as the original 'Guardians.'
I guess the first one was more fun, but I liked this one just as much.
I think the plot for Vol. 2 just wasn't anything special.  I could predict everything that would happen.
But don't you think that adding Kurt Russell onto the cast was a brilliant move?
Oh, I absolutely loved the casting choices.  Kurt as Starlord's dad was a really good choice.
And I'm glad characters like Nebula and Yondu were added to the main cast.
Yea, that was a really cool part.  I'm all about the redemption.
Also, don't forget Baby Groot.
Baby Groot was adorable.  Maybe my favorite part of the movie.
You know that Baby Groot was still voiced by Vin Diesel?
Oh I had no idea.  That's pretty funny.
Yea, especially when you think about his normal voice.
I hope the third movie is as quirky as the original one.
I'm sure James Gunn knows what he's doing.
That I can agree with.  As long as the script itself is good, James will make magic with it.
For sure.  I can't wait to see it.
