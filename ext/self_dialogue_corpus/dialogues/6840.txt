We watched The Lion King last night.
A blast from the past. I like that movie.
Me too. Not only the movie, but the music too.
That has to be one of the best Disney movies.
Yeah, who are those two characters he makes friends with.
Timone and Pumba.
Tha's them. You'd think I'd remember their names.
Scar deserved what he got.
There's a Scar in everyone's life, isn't there?
Yes there is. I know I have one in my family.
