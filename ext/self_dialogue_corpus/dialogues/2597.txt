Have you heard any news on the Broncos new quarterback
I heard about Trevor Siemens as the starting quarterback.
Is he any good?
I heard he was pretty good but his style is different then Payton Manning
Hopefully the team can get use to his style quickly.
I hope so they can have a good season.
I would love to see them in the playoff.
I liked the one year durning playoff when the Manning brothers had to go against each other.
That would have to be diffacult since the are both extremely competative.
I wonder if Payton might coach since he is retired from NFL now.
i just found it here that Coach Gary Kubiak announced to his team that Siemian will be the team's starting quarterback
So it is a definat that he will be filling Mannings shoes
Thats what i am reading so far.
Thats a lot of pressure for him.
It seems like he is pretty good so he should handel it pretty well.
So who is the 2nd in line
It says Sanchez was close with Sieman so i will assime he is next in line
Both seem to be pretty good and extremely hard workers
Well i hope it works out and they make it to the playoff.
Im sure they will be there maybe we will get lucky and they will win the championship.
