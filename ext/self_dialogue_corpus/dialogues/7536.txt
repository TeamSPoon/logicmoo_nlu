Okay, can we talk about how bad the Burrow burning scene was in Half-Blood Prince?
I mean, I get what they were going for, they wanted to add something darker to offset all the wacky forced high school romance, right?
Exactly, I think they could've done that better if they, you know, actually did stuff from the books. Just take Hannah out of class one day because her mother died, that actress had done a couple of Harry Potter movies, that would've been fine!
I think it's a part of movie-language's whole "Show, don't tell" thing.
But then why have Bellatrix and Fenrir, a known murderer and a known cannibal, show up if they weren't going to murder and/or eat anyone?
That's a good point, they only sent out Stunning Charms, didn't they?
Maybe, I couldn't tell. All spells look the same in the movies.
And when they burned down the Burrow, it was back and fine again in the next movie.
Because they established earlier that there's a spell that can fix things earlier in Half-Blood Prince, so there was no reason to worry in the first place.
Wow, you're right, that actually accomplished nothing.
