What are you going to wear to the festival this year?
I'm not sure. I want to be fashion forward but...
But what?
I don't really like many of the new trends this Spring?
What? I'm obsessed
I'm a little more preppy, and this Spring's styles are a little too boho for my taste.
I'm obsessed with the lace and embroidery.
Yeah, that's not my thing.
Floral prints are in too! What about that?
Yeah, not my fave but that's probably my best option for the festival.
Flesh tones are in too.
Yeah that's cool as long as it's close to baby pink!
I think I'm gonna wear a full length lace dress.
I think I'll wear a floral mini, but I have to see what's in stores.
Do you wanna go shopping this weekend?
I'm not sure if we like the same stores, but sure!
We'll check out department stores, we'll both have options that way.
Ok, sounds like a plan. And Marshalls!
Definitely!
Cool I'll look up some ideas online first!
