What's your favorite Harry Potter movie?
I like the first one the most!
Why is that?
I really like the sense of wonderment and the discovery of magic. What's your favorite?
Well I like the change of direction in 3!
Yea that's definitely when it got more serious.
What's your least favorite?
I would say the second one, it just didn't hit home as well.
Yea that makes sense, the characters were kinda jokey for the serious situation.
Yea, and 5 was much better as a book than a movie.
