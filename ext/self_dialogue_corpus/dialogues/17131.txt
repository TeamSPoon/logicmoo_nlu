I never realized how much music meant to me until I got older, how about you?
With me it's when I realized how old my favorite bands, groups or individuals have gotten, especially when I heard someone died.
What decade was your favorite for music, for me it was 70's and 80's.
Same here but more the 80's.
What were some of your favorites?
Billy Idol, Duran Duran, Tears For Fears, Anita Baker, The Spinners, Tom Petty
Billy Idol here too!
I loved it when he curled up his lip.
I wouldn't want to meet him in a dark alley.
I would.......lol back then that is.
It seemed every time he put out a song it was a winner.
I really liked the music in Eyes Without A Face and many others of his.
What about Duran Duran?
OH MY! Simon La Bon.......dreamy
They too couldn't seem to do wrong back then.
And the videos too.
My favorite is Hungry Like A Wolf.
That and Rio, Come Undone, Wild Boys
Too bad we all have to get older
Yes, but remember like liquor we get better with age!
