Have you seen frozen?
Yes, I love it.
Me too, what is your favorite song.
Do you want to build a snowman? Is my favorite
Yeah that one is cute, but my favorite is Let it Go.
That one is really good.
Which sister is your favorite
I love Anna, she is so approachable.
Well especially compared to her icy sister.
This is true, although later Elsa warms up, and I love how sisterly love prevailed in the end.
