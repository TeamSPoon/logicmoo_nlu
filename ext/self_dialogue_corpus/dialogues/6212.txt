I wish I could be shrunk like they did in that movie from Disney.
Which movie is that?
Honey I Shrunk The Kids.
Oh yeah. That was cool how it looked when they were running in the grass.
Yes, but creept too, with the ants.
Yeah, actually it was.
No I mean to be able to sneak anywhere and not get caught.
Yes but look how many times they almost got crushed.
A mad scientist father who creates a shrink machine.
Well, only in a Disney movie.
