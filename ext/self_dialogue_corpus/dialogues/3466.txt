Did you see the Trailer for Black Panther?
Yup.
Aren't you excited?
Meh.
Meh, why?
Well, no offense, but I can't relate to a superhero from Africa.
I understand, but that does sound bad.
I'm sure I'll like it, but it's like Spider-Man. I just don't care about the character.
You will, The actor and story are great.
We'll see.
