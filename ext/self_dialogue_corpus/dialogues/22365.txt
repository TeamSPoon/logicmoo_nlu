Someone asked me what my favorite movie of all time is. I have so many I don't know how to answer!
I'm the same. There are so many good ones.
I'm torn between Forrest Gump and Schindler's List.
Wow, well those are certainly very different types of movies!
I know, I know. Both Oscar winning ones though.
I've always wanted to rent/buy DVD's of every single Best Picture Oscar winning movie, and watch them all.
What a great idea!
If only they were sold as gift sets like that!
Who knows, maybe they are. That is really good idea, but it would take you forever to watch them all.
I'd watch them over time though. Some I have already seen.
I'm really bad with those things - I think I haven't seen many Oscar winning movies.
Maybe  because you have bad taste in movies...
Very funny! You may have a point though..
Based on some of the movies I've seen you interested in, they're more likely to win Razzies that Oscars
What is a Razzie?
A Razzie is an award show for terrible movies! Worst picture, worst actor etc.
Give me an example of a movie or actor that has won recently
Ok. Paris Hilton won for worst actress
Well that makes sense!
Yes, she's terrible!
