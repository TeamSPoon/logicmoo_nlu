Do you ever listen to Gospel music?
Once in awhile I do, it's not my favorite kind of music but I do enjoy it.
I remember first listening to it back in high school.
Which Gospel artists do you enjoy?
I like some of Kirk Franklin's music. What about you?
He's okay, I really like his song "Imagine Me."
Oh yes I love that one! He's a pretty good artist.
Do you know who Fred Hammond is?
Yes I do. He's also a good one.
I really like his song "Glory to Glory."
Yes me too. It gets you excited and hyped up.
I know I love his songs!
They make you want to dance and sing.
Yes I sometimes listen to Gospel music while I get ready for church.
I do that too. Especially when I am putting on my make up.
Do you like any other Gospel artists?
I also really like Marvin Sapp. Have you heard of him?
No I don't think I have. What is the name of one of his songs?
One of my favorites is "Never Would Have Made it."
Oh okay! I will have to check out his music soon.
