do you have a favorite superhero movie?
probably the dark knight.
heath ledger was absolutely amazing.
he MADE the movie.
my favorite joker of all time.
he was pure anarchy and crazinesss.
DO YOU KNOW HOW I GOT THESE SCARS???
yeah, and he kept changing his reasoning.
he probably did not know how he got those scars himself
maybe he just drew them on.
