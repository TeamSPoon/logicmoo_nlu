What's your favorite Disney song ?
Are you serious , there are so many !!
I think I would say mine would be a song from Mulan!
Is it I'll make a man out of you?
Yes! How did you know ?!?
Everyone is obsessed with that scene and song in the movie.
I find it so inspiring!
I do too, especially when she climbs the pole !
That part is amazing !
We really need to watch Mulan like right now.
