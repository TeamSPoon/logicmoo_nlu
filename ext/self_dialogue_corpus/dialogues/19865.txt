Do you listen to country music?
Yes I do
I just heard an old song on the radio
Which one?
God bless the broken road
By rascals flatts?
Yes
That's suprising
I know, it's been out for years.
I guess they felt like mixing it up
I guess so
I like stations that play a mix of new and old anyway
Me too
I hate stations that play new songs so much you get sick of them
Exactly.
On my Sirius radio I listen to prime country
I used to do that when I had sirus
It's a good way to mix it up
Yes, I miss the old stuff
Me too
