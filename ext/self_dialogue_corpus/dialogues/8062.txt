Who do you think is the greatest pop singer of all time?
You mean, besides Michael Jackson, the King of Pop?
Besides Michael Jackson. And besides Madonna. Who would you say?
I'd have to say Elvis Presley then.
You're probably right. I would put Prince and George Michael on that short list also.
Oh, I totally agree! Prince is more R&B, though.
Maybe. But George Michael is right up there and totally pop.
It's so sad that almost all of that list is dead now.
I can't believe it, either.
Their incredible music lives on, at least.
