Do you think that the Harry Potter books or movies were better?
I definitely think that the books were much better than the movies.
I like the movies because I think the actors did a really great job.
I can see that - Emma Watson was the perfect Hermione.
And Richard Harris was perfect as Dumbledore.
I still think the books were better though.
Honestly, I didn't read the books.
The books have so many more details that the movies leave out though.
Like what?
Well, they leave a lot of info out about Dumbledore's family.
