Do you think Tom Cruise movies are any good?
Well, some of them are I think.
I have not like many since Top Gun.
Top Gun was one of his best and Val Kilmers as well.
I think he tanked it in Vannila Sky, I am still confused by that movie.
It was his GIgi.
His what?
The movie with Jennifer Lopez and Ben Afleck, a flop.
Oh, yeah, in like 2005.
Yes, awful movie. Almost as bad as Glitter.
With Mariah Carey?
That is the one.
She is going to be in the new Amy Pohler movie.
What movie?
It is called The House.
With the gambling and WIll Ferrel?
That is the one. I think it will be funny.
I hope it is, I like that actress.
She is always funny in her shows.
I like Kate Mckinnon too, all her movies are a riot.
