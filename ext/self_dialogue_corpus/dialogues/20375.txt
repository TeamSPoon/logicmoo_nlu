Have you seen the movie 'Porky's'?
No I have never heard of it, what is it about?
It is a story about high school friends set back in the 1950's in Angel Beach Florida.
So what is so great about the movie?
Well first of all it has a lots of great muscle cars!
I like old muscle cars.
And they are pulling pranks on each other .
What kinda pranks?
One time they lured the football team out to an old abandoned house, in the promise of some sexual encounter with an experianced older woman, and had a guy jump out with a machete and chase them down, naked.
That doesn't sound funny.
Oh but it is! When PeeWee is spotted by the cops running down the road and they pick him up and take him back home, its just too funny.
What else is there?
They are constantly trying to see girls, and they are always trying to dodge this one teacher who is trying to catch them all the time.
That sounds interesting.
It is, they put  asnake in the toilet while she is using the restroom and she runs out screaming in front of all the kids at basketball practice.
Why would they do that to her?
She is know as Bula Ballbricker, and she is really mean to kids and other teachers.
I guess she gets what is coming to her?
She sure does!
Cool, I might have to check it out.
