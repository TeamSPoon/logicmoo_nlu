do you like radiohead
i like their old material
and not their new stuff?
they went too far into outer space
thats a weird way of putting it
can you even consider them a rock band anymore?
i guess they dont care to be defined
its kinda more electronic now
yeah, their stuff is so much weirder now
alot of the time it sounds like theres no point
i liked lotus and in rainbows
in rainbows was that free album,right?
yeah, it was a big deal that they did that
not many huge bands released a free album
they had some guts and could have lost money
a lot of people paid more for it though
they lucked out
yeah, but anyway their old material was more rock
thats what you liked?
i need my guitars
