Hey!  I scored tickets to see Coldplay!
Awesome.  Where?
Later this year in San Diego.
Lucky dog!  Where are they playing in San Diego?
Qualcomm Stadium in Mission Valley. I have an extra ticket.
Cool!  Can I come?
Only if you can name 3 of their number 1 songs!
Man, you drive a hard bargain!  Viva la Vida!
OK, that's one.  Two more.
I was thinking "Princess of China" with Rihanna?
Nope, that never reached number 1!  Strike one!
Oh man, what happens if I guess wrong?
I give the extra ticket to your wife!
OK, ok - How about "Fix you"?
That's two right!  Give me one more and we're going together.
The pressure is killing me!  How about "Every Teardrop is a Waterfall"?
And you're correct!  It's going to be a great time!
Whew! Awesome!
I'm glad that you guessed right.  I really didn't want to go with my wife.
I don't have a wife.
