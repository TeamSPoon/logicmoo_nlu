Mark Walhburg is very talented , just watched "Daddy's Home"
I seen that, he and Ferrell play well off each other.
I agree, and Walhburg looks good on a bike!
hahaha no agruement there. Did you see the part where Ferrell tried to ride that motorcycle? Too funny.
The look on Ferrell's face when dude arrives at the airport was priceless.
If I had been him, in that role, I would have felt so ugly.
Did Ferrell do a scene where he is naked at some point running. That is like his trademark.
I can't remember, but he was good in the movie as well.
Its a shame it didn't get more attention in the theaters.
Have you seen the trailers for 'daddy's Home 2'?
no, I didn't know they were doing a part 2 .
You will never guess what they did.
What did they do?
The trailer shows where they guys' dads come for the holidays. And guess who they got to play the parts?
I can't even imagine ...
Mel Gibson is Walhburg's dad and John Lithgow from 3rd rock is Ferell's dad.
Wow, that is an odd pairing, but could be really funny.
John Lithgow is a hoot and a half in everything he is in.
This is true, and with Ferrell I bet this one has even more physical comedy.
I wonder if they considered Steve Martin? He has always been grerat with physical comedy.
