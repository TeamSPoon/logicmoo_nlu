Did you know that Alice Cooper is coming out with a new album next month?
I haven't heard that.
It's called Paranormal.
That's a good name for the kind of music he does.
I heard the new single and it sounded pretty good.
What's it called?
Paranoiac Personality.
Is it out on YouTube?
That's where I heard it.
I've got to go listen to it.
