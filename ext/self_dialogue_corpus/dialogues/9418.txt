Do you like any rap music?
Yes, my favorite rapper has got to be Eminem.
Oh yes, he was one of the best rappers, I had all of his CD's from years ago.
So did i! All of his songs were so memorable.
I wish he would come out with another CD.
So do i, music is not the same like it was years ago.
Do you have a favorite song of his?
Yes, i have two favorites, Mockingbird and Slim Shady.
My favorite songs of his are all of them from his album "The real Slim Shady".
I agree, I loved listening to his music while in the car with the windows rolled down.
