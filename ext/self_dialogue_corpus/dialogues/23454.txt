Have you seen the latest Adam Sandler movie, Sandy Wexler?
No I haven't seen that one yet. I saw the previews for it and can't wait to give it a try.
It is pretty good even though it is not really what I am used to with Adam Sandler.
I guess since he does so many movies he was bound to do something different as some point.
Yeah, I love pretty well every one of his movies.
Oh yeah me to. I would say one of my favorites would have to be 50 First Dates.
Oh that is a great one. Him and Drew Barrymore make a great team.
They definitely do. The movie Blended with them both was awesome.
Yeah, I love watching that movie over and over.
He is a pretty good actor, plus he does a lot of animated films for children to.
My kids love his Hotel Transylvania movies.
Those are so cute plus I heard they are coming out with a third one to add to the series.
I will definitely be going to see that movie then.
That movie Pixels he did was awesome. Have you ever seen that one?
Is that the one where he has to fight off the aliens who come to earth as classic arcade games?
Yeah that is the one. Is is partly animated but a great family movie.
The preview for that movie looks awesome. I am going to watch it whenever I have time.
You should definitely give it a try, that and The Cobbler.
Oh yeah I have seen The Cobbler; another great movie of his.
Yeah, he always puts out awesome movies.
