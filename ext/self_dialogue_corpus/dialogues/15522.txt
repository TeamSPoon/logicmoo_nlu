Do you have any plans for the day?
I am going to get some cleaning done and listen to some music.
What type of music are you into?
I love the Dixie Chicks!
I have not listened to them in a very long time.
I wished they would get back together and make music like they used to!
Which of their songs did you like?
Wow, that would be a very long list!
So you are a really big fan, huh?
Yes, I always wanted to see them in concert but I never got the chance.
Maybe some day you will be able to see them in a comeback tour or something.
I sure hope you are right about that!
I used to love that song Landslide.
Yea that was a good one. Have you ever heard Goodbye Earl?
Yes! I even remember the video to that one.
Cowboy and Not Ready To Make Nice are two great ones as well.
My mom used to love those two songs.
They got in to a big feud with Tobey Keith over some comments they made.
I remember all that drama when it happened.
Personally I think people were way too hard on them.
