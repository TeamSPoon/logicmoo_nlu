How do you like the concert experience?
I love it.
So do I, i love seeing a band play songs I can sing along to.
Yeah and its important that they sound good outside of the studio.
Sometimes you can barely hear the vocals though.
All depends where you are
I like to be up front most of the time.
OK so thats good real estate for music listening.
Yeah and I always make sure I am wearing loose clothing.
Cause of the mosh pits?
Yes sometimes they can be annoying.
I love them.
I Just want to hear the singer sing most of the time.
Do you buy albums at the show?
No usually I dont buy anything.
Do you ever drink beforehand?
I think having a slight buzz is a good thing to listen to music with.
I agree its encompassing.
Have you ever gone to an all acoustic show.
Yes and it was very boring
