Have you heard of the band, Spoon?
Yes. I listen to them occasionally. They come up on my Pandora stations a lot.
Have you listened to their albums?
Somewhat. I know I like Gimme Fiction and They Want My Soul especially.
Have you heard their new album?
I haven't yet. But I've heard the hype about it. Do you like it?
I'm a little disappointed. I loved their last album and listened to it endlessly.
What did you not like about it?
It seemed to be very synth motivated and overworked.
What do you mean by overworked?
It was overproduced. They had someone else master this particular album and it just ended up to "busy" for my tastes.
I'm curious. Who was the one that mastered it?
I can't remember his name. But, he's known for doing all the Flaming Lips albums.
Oh! I love the Flaming Lips and all their albums. I'm wondering why the same formula didn't work for Spoon.
I think it's because Spoon is at it's best when there is a lot of space. They are known for that/
That makes sense. I love Britt's gritty guitar.
Agreed. Which is why I don't like this album nearly as much as the others.
But that's their signature! Are you telling me that there's no dirty guitar on this album?
Pretty much. That's what I'm telling you. It's all synth, really poppy, and super busy. It's A LOT of sounds but no guitar.
I'm going to go check it out. It sounds like they got misled from their path by signing on with this studio engineer.
