I can't wait for the new Tool album. It's been years!
Oh, really? I haven't heard from them in a long time.
Yeah, they haven't released a new album in over a decade.
Wow, over a decade? Did they break up?
No, not officially. They've just taken their time making a new album!
What was their last album? Lateralus?
No, 10,000 Days. It was released in 2005.
So they have a new album coming out soon?
Hopefully. They haven't officially announced anything soon.
Oh, really? So there might not be a new album?
Well, maybe not. But there's evidence that there will be.
What kind of evidence?
I've heard reports that they've been in the studio, and that their singer has started recording vocals.
That sounds promising. I assume they're not touring then.
No, they've been playing a few shows here and there.
Oh, wow. Have they been playing new material.
Not exactly. Mostly they've been playing old songs.
That doesn't sound good. I wonder if they actually will come out with a new album.
I don't know for sure, but I'm excited by the prospect.
Me too. Thanks for letting me know!
