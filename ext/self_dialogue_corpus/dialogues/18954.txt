So what kind of music do you listen to?
Mainly ska, hip hop and melodic folk metal.
Ska?
Yep.
I don't know what that is.
Oh, well it's a fun style of music that typically has a walking baseline, and horns, and there are similar themes in the lyrics.
Is it like Jazz?
No, although I've heard some artists incorporate jazz styles into some of their songs.
Hmm, sounds interesting.
It really is. The horns are probably my favourite part, so I like more third wave Ska myself.
How many waves are there?
Well there's first wave which came out of Jamaica in the 60's, then there's 2-tone ska which I'm not as familiar with but it came around in the 70's, and then my favourite, third wave ska surged from the 80's on.
And it's the one with all the horns.
Well, it has the biggest horn sections of the 3 installments of Ska.
You'll have to introduce me to some of your favourite bands sometime.
I'd love to. I actually don't know anyone who's familiar with Ska who doesn't love it.
Well that sounds promising!
Yeah! There's even a dance people do to it that's called "skanking".
I'm all about that.
Great! I could use someone to skank with.
