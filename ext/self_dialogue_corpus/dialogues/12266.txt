Did you like how C3PO was used in Star Wars?
Sure I mean he was a side piece.
But dont you think he deserved more attention
Like his own spin off?
Yeah because of his characterization
No I think that would have not been believable.
I think things would have tidied up nicely with him at the helm.
So at the beginning of Empire Strikes back you wanted him to hit someone?
I didnt say he had to be violent.
Well I dont know what you would have him do.
