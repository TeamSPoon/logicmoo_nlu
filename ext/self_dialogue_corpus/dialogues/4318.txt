What is favorite thriller?
I would say seven.
brad pitt was at his peak in the role. At least to me  his peak in looks.
I think around that time he had some great roles, seven, fight club, legends of the fall, sleepers.
He certainly had a great ride during those years. Morgan freeman was great as well.
I liked freeman in this role especially, I found him super believable.
Yes, he is a strong talent in general. Gwenyth paltrow was a little forgettable,like almost could have been any actress.
Maybe, I mean I find her very capable in this role, but maybe the role itself was not as meaty as brad or morgan's.
I think you have apoint thee, so much of a performance is based in the script or role itself.
Can't make meatloaf with no meat.
