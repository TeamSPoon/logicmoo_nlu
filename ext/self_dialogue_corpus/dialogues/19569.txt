You don't listen to a lot of music, do you?
What makes you say that?
I just notice that when you listen to the radio, it's usually comedy programs.
Yeah, I tend to do that at work. If I listen to music, it's much more distracting for some reason.
Oh, I see. That makes sense.
But I do love music, too. What I love most, in fact, are comedy songs.
Comedy songs? Like who, for instance?
Oh, you know, someone like Weird Al Yankovic. He's hilarious.
Is he the guy that does all the parody songs? Like doing Eat It as a parody for Michael Jackson's Beat It?
That's him. I just think he's so clever. The way he can find the perfect word or phrase to totally send up of popular song.
Yeah, he is funny. And the videos he does are great. I loved the one he did that spoofed Nirvana.
I know, wasn't that great? I never thought he'd be able to make himself look like Kurt Cobain, but he did.
OK, so who else?
Well, I like Monty Python in general, and they do a lot of funny songs.
Right. Like the Spam song.
That's a classic. My favorite is Always Look On The Bright Side Of Life.
I remember that one. From their last movie.
Exactly. I also like a guy named Richard Cheese. He takes rock and roll songs, punk songs, hip hop, and reworks them to be Sinatra-style songs.
Richard Cheese? Oh my gosh, what a name.
You should hear some of his songs. You would crack up, I guarantee.
