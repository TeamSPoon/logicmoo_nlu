Do you think the pop genre needs saving?
In what respect?
I think that there isnt anyone churning out hit after hit anymore.
Sure there is but with the internet we just hear more about diverse artists
It seems like there is a ton of producers who are now becoming artists
Yeah thats the ebb and flow of the industry
So you think that we will see Katy Perry's song writer eventually come out on their own?
They may have already done so
I never really thought about what else could happen
This is probably one of the biggest conundrum's in the genre
