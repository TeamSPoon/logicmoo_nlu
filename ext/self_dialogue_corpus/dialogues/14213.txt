Have you been listening to Lady Gaga recently?
No not recently unfortunately.
What album was your favorite?
I loved listening to the Fame.
That album was very classic. It was so catchy and luxurious.
She is such an icon like madonna.
That is for sure.
I want to hear her new album sometime.
You won't be dissapointed I don't think.
Well that is good at least.
