Are you getting pumped for that New Star Wars movie this winter?
Yeah, I'll definitely go see it.
You don't sound super pumped.
The last two movies they've made were definite improvements over the prequels, but they were both movies that I found myself liking less the more I thought about them.
Oh, so you're a Star Wars hater.
No, I definitely have a soft spot in my heart for Star Wars!
Haha, OK. What's your favorite prequel?
Probably the third one. Revenge of the Sith or something?
Yeah, I think that was it.
It was the only one of the three that wasn't objectively bad, in my opinion.
