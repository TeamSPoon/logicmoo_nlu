Do you like Jabba the Hutt?
Yes, he is very funny in Return of the Jedi.
Wasn't he in the first one?
Not originally, but in the updated one yes.
He looks a lot different doesn't he?
Yeah, he's not a puppet in part 1, but he is in part 3.
I wondered why it looked so different.
Was he always supposed to be a big worm looking guy?
Actually there was an actor who played him originally.
Wow, I did not know that.
