Did you see the first movie in the Fast and Furious series?
Oh yes, back when it was first released!
Who was your favorite character?
Brian - who was yours?
I really like Letty.  She is the only one who can contain Dom.
She's not the only one, Brian really reigned in him too.
But, Brian let him go at the end.
That is true, but they did team up again in later movies.
The soundtrack for the first will always be my favorite though.
I still like the soundtrack from the seventh movie.
