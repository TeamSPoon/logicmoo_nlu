I want to be ready when I watch the new Xmen. Where should I start?
There are so many Xmen related movies.
The Logan guy has his own movie right?
He actually has three stand alone movies.
Wow, are they all like Logan the movie.
Not really, not as dark.
Should I watch the original trilogy?
I would and then the wolverine stand alone films and then Logan.
Are there any other?
Well, technically you should also watch Deadpool.
I thought he was a whole different type of movie.
Deadpool movies are far more raunchy, but he is in their world.
Wow I did not even realize that.
Yes, he comments on them both in and out of the forth wall.
You mean the way he is aware he is in a movie?
Yeah, that is part of the character, he knows he is in a comic as well as a move.
Do you think they will include Dead pool in the new movies?
I wouldn't be surprised if he makes a cameo.
I would love to see Dead Pool and Ian Mckellen in a movie.
I think that would be really funny.
