Do you like Tupac?
I do! He is one of the best rappers in history
What is your favorite Tupac song?
"Dear Mama" is my favorite. It always makes me cry.
I love that one. But I also really like "Hail Mary"
I don't know that song. Would I like it?
I think you would! I really love the message behind it.
His lyrics were always so powerful.
It is such a shame that he is dead.
But fortunately his legacy lives on.
