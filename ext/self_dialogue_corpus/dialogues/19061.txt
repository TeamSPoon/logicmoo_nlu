How many songs to do you have in itunes?
Thousands.
Do you listen to them all?
Probably not.  What about you?
Likewise.  I probably have 100 or so songs that I listen to regularly at any given time.
I wish there was a better way of organizing music than itunes.
Yes, I agree.  I am not a fan of itunes either.
Well, if you hear of a better way to store and listen to music, let me know.
You'd think that that would be something Apple would want to work on and improve, but they never seem to get it right.
Speaking on Apple, do you like Fiona Apple?
I'm not too familiar with her work.
She had a few albums and a few public-eye moments.
Are you a fan?
I think she is an interesting artist and has an unusual voice.
I'll have to look her up.
Speaking of other Apples, Chris Martin and Gwenyth Paltrow's daughter is named Apple.
Is that Chris Martin from Coldplay?
Yes, do you like them?
I liked his first album, but not his subsequent ones.
I really liked "Rush of blood to the head."
