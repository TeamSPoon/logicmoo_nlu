Circus is my favorite Britney Spears album.
I really like that one.
My favorite song on it is Womanizer.
My favorite is Blur.
That song is really underrated.
I know. It deserves so much more credit.
What did you think of her album Blackout?
I absolutely loved it.
Me too. Piece of Me is still one of my favorite songs.
Mine too. I could listen to that album all day.
