Why are so many Mets players getting hurt?
Thats something I cant answer
And their pitchers are refusing treatment?
It goes against what teams should do.
I mean are the inmates running things over there?
The team needs to evaluate its training staff.
They are losing young guns too
I think they assume that its just the kinks of being young
Some of them have weird deliveries
And refuse to get MRIs
Yeah thats something they have to figure out
They have been a disappointment so far
I dont know how they have no hitting
Guys were let go that were valuable
Its true and they dont really have a clutch hitter
Why did they bring back Reyes?
Who knows hes a shell of himself
They should sign Utley. He always hits homers into that right field corner
I think his career is over too.
Yeah hes barely hitting one hundred
