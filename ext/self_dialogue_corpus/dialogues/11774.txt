Do you ever listen to any of the slower, sad Beatles songs?
Of course! Some of them make me cry like a baby.
Me too! Which ones?
Yesterday always makes me cry. How about you?
She's Leaving Home makes me cry. Every time I listen to it I have to hear a funny one after.
Like Maxwells Silver Hammer?
Yes! And Mean Mister Mustard
What is your favorite happy Beatles song?
Probably Yellow Submarine or Golden Slumbers.
Those are great songs.
