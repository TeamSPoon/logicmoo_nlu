Did you ever get to go see Logan?
No, I didn't how was it?
It was incredible! You really need to see it!
Yeah, I thought it looked really good.
It totally was. I was hooked from beginning to end.
Who was in that?
Well, Hugh Jackman, of course and Patrick Stewart.
Well of course.
It wasn't really a big billed cast, it had a lot of new comers.
Interesting. How did Patrick Stewart do with the aging parts?
It was so real, he looked like he was really wasting away to nothing.
Was it CGI or a body double?
No! It was actually Patrick Stewart.
For real?
Yes! He lost 20 some pounds just to play the role.
Wow, that's a lot. He's not a big guy to begin with.
I know, and at his age, that must have been hard.
I'm sure, its hard for young people to lose that much weight!
I read online that Hugh Jackman genuinely held Stewart in all the scenes of Wolverine carrying professor Xavier.
That's really crazy. I can't wait to see it!
