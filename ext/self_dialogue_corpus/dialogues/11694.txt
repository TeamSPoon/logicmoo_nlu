Who is your all-time favorite band?
It would have to be the Beatles.
Oh, I love them, too! What's your favorite album?
Rubber Soul. Such great songs - especially "Day Tripper" and "We Can Work It Out".
That's just when they were starting to transcend their teenybopper pop roots. I prefer their later, more psychedelic stuff like Sgt. Pepper's.
I enjoy that, too, but some of that stuff is too far out there for me. I like the songs where Lennon and McCartney seem to work together well.
Everyone always talks about Lennon and McCartney, but George was great, too.
Yeah, he had a really strong solo career. Not as strong as John's, but stronger than Paul's, in my opinion.
Did you know there was a "Fifth Beatle", their producer, George Martin.
I think I read that once. He was a master, too!
