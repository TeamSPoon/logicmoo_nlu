I need your help with an 80''s playlist.
Ok, what's it for?
We are having an 80''s themed party and I want to have plenty of songs to last all day. I have a good start but could use some more.
OK, anything off limits?
Nope, I like everything from rock to love sones. Probably not too much country though.
Ok, we'll you definitely have to have Rick Astley, Never Gonna Give You Up
Haha Rick rolling everyone. Great idea.
You should play it every few songs just for fun.
I think I might do that.
How about the Cars? They have a bunch of great hits.
Yes, good thinking. I hadn't added them yet.
How about Rosanna from Toto?
Oh yeah! Did you know he wrote that for Rosanna Arquette after they broke up?
I did! How crazy would it be to hear that song all the time knowing it was for you?
Indeed. Ok what else?
Prince, Michael jackson, Madonna, Cydia Lauper, Talking Heads, Lionel Richie...
Oh I had forgotten about Talking Heads, thank you!
Don't forget hair metal. Def Leppard, Poison, Tesla, Skid Row
Oh yeah, I have all of those. And Van Halen too.
Definitely can't leave Van Halen out!
