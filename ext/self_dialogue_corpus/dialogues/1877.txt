I'm pumped about the new NFL season. I'm interested in how the teams will work out this year.
Yeah, I have my favorite teams.
With the teams, any idea how all of that works?
Only because I'm self-taught. I've picked things up here and there.
Tell me, how do the teams work?
There are two conferences, with thirty-two clubs. Sixteen teams per conference.
And how do the games work? Must be pretty systematic.
So the conferences are further split into four divisions, consisting of four clubs within each one.
And they all get matched up against each other.
Over a sixteen game season.
How do they pick who plays and who doesn't?
Each team can have up to 53 players, and of those only46 can be "active." playing on game days.
That's a lot of manpower. Lots of active players too.
And this doesn't account for possible practice squad players. They're regulated too.
For a ball game, football has a lot of rules.
Its not bad though. Could be worse.
I like the fact its a homegrown sport.
All the NFL teams are based in the continental US, I believe.
Well maybe. I'll look that one up.
I haven't heard of teams in Hawaii or Alaska!
