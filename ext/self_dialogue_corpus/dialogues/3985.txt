Hey look, When A Stranger Calls is coming on tonight.
Which one?
There's more than one?
Yeah! There was that old one from the 1979 and then there was a sequel and then they remade it in 2006.
Oh, I didn't know that. It looks like the newer one is on.
Okay. I didn't think it was as good as the original personally but it has its own merit.
I've seen this one before and thought it was pretty good, suspenseful and scary without too many jump scares.
Me too, I think it has sufficient build up and the music was a good choice for it.
But it doesn't beat the original for you?
It really can't compare to the original, though I like them both just the same.
