Did you see any of the animated films that got nominated for Oscars this year?
Uh... maybe, what were they?
Zootopia, Moana, Kubo and the Two Strings and... two others I don't remember.
I saw all of those!
Nice, I've only seen Zootopia and Kubo.
Do you know which movie won?
Yeah, it was Zootopia, to no one's surprise, I think.
That makes sense, they tend to really like movies with a social justice bent.
Indeed. I really enjoyed Zootopia, though.
It was fun, but I thought Kubo and the Two Strings was better.
Really? I thought that movie was super dark.
It was, but I thought it addressed some really great themes that aren't always in kids movies.
Such as?
Well, for one thing, that while family is important and all, sometimes family is also cruel, and it's not wrong to try to escape that.
I guess that's true, there are a lot of movies that have a very "family before all else" kind of vibe.
Exactly, and when you come from a broken or abuse home, sometimes it's just not true that family is always there for you.
What else did you think Kubo offered?
I mean, themes aside, that animation was absolutely amazing.
Oh yes, I loved watching all the folding origami!
Haha, see, and that's why I think that movie was fantastic
