Do you think the Warriors will pull it off this year?
I think so. I think they have the most wins this year right?
Yeah. But remember what happened last year.
The Cavaliers won, barely, and in game 7. The Warriors are better this year though.
Yeah. First they have to knock out the Spurs.
Which they will. And the Cavaliers will knock out Boston.
I would be shocked if it didn't come down between the Cavaliers and Warriors.
That would be interesting.
But it's not going to happen.
But anyway, I don't know. we'll see if the Cavaliers have a plan this year.
I know they got Williams now. That's the only thing I see that could be a game changer for them.
Korver isn't shooting 3's as well as he used to.
And maybe Williams will make up for that.
Whatever. I'm just glad Williams didn't end up here in Utah. We were considering trading for him.
I doubt anyone in Utah wants Williams back. But yeah I heard that was a possibility.
We still hold a little bit of a grudge for what he did to Sloan and Hayward.
To Hayward? What did Williams do to Hayward?
He was just constantly disrespecting him on the court.
Like how? What did he do?
He threw the ball at him, berated him so many times right after each play.
