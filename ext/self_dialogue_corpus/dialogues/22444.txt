Do you like movies?
Yes I love them
Do you have a favorite?
Not really, I just saw Boss Baby
Was it good?
Yes it was, my kids loved it too
I've been meaning to see it
You should it's funny
I've also been meaning to see Beauty and the beast
Me too, I love the animated one though
Beauty and the Beast was always my favorite Disney classic I was wondering how it came out
I was wondering too.  Mine was the lion king
I like the lion king, and Aladdin. That was a great movie
Aladdin was one of my favorites too
I liked all of them, I think there were two or three
Yes they were good, so was pocohontas
It's been a long time. I don't remember that one as well
I want to grt my vhs player out and all my tapes now.
I know what you mean me too.
Or I could just buy digital copies
