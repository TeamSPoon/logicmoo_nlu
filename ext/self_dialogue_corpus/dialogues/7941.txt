Do you like Hanson?
Yes, the have been my favorite since MMMBop came out in 1996.
Have you ever seen them live?
Oh gosh yes! 7-8 times.
Can you believe they have 11 kids between them?
Are you serious?!?!?! I had no clue they had that many.
Do you know when their next tour is?
I don't but I would love to go see them if you wanted to get tickets.
Their new song is amazing, its so empowering.
I know it makes me want to go out and chase my dreams!
