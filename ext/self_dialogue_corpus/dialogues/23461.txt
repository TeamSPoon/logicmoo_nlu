So, my boyfriend and I are in the middle of a huge movie debate.
Oh, yeah? What about?
We are arguing over which Star Wars movie is the worst one.
And what does each side say?
Well, I said that it was Attack of the Clones.
And what reasons did you have for this point of view.
The acting is so wooden and unfeeling. The murder of the yound Jedis seems to be too dark for the series. And, of course, Jar Jar Binks is in it.
That sounds like a pretty solid argument to me.
Yeah, I thought so, too.
OK. What did your boyfriend say?
He said the little known Star Wars holiday special is the worst Star Wars movie.
And what was his reasoning?
The fact that it is based almost entirely around Wookies, so you can't understand the dialogue. Also, the fact that most of the star characters don't even appear in the movie.
Who is actually in it?
Chewbacca, Han Solo, and Princess Leia. That's it.
Wow, sounds boring.
I guess so. I hate to admit it, but he also has another really valid point.
What could possibly top a movie franchise realeasing a movie without the majority of its stars?
George Lucas has basically denied the exsitence of this holiday special, refuses to release it on video, and threatened to destory all copies of it.
OK. When the creator of the franchise denies that one of his movies exists, that must mean it really sucks. Your boyfriend wins this debate. Sorry!
