Are you looking forward to "The Last Jedi"?
Yes, it's going to be great!
Do you know the director?
Rian Johnson, right?
Yes! Did you know he used to work on Breaking Bad?
No way, really?
He did. He is famous for directing one of the highest rated episodes of the show, Ozymandias.
Neat! That means he's used to making things with a more dark and serious tone.
Definitely. I hope Last Jedi turns out like Empire Strikes Back; its my favorite.
Should be fun to see how it turns out. Can't wait until December!
