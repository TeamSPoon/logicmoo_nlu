My old college roommate and I were so excited to see The Princess and The Frog.
Why?
It was the first black Disney princess and it is set in New Orleans, where she and I went to college.
Oh yeah, I forgot you lived there before.
I got pretty nostalgic watching the different locations in the movie.
I can imagine.
Thioe day were so fun. I loved New Orleans and I love my old room mate
Plus it's a quality movie.
Of course, Disney never steers you wrong.
They really are a class act.
