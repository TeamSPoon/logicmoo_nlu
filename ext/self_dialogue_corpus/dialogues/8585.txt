How was Limp Bizkit so popular?
They played a genre of music that people loved.
Rock has always been around though.
I agree but they put a twist on it.
They also started out covering Faith by George Michael.
That was a great track
Yeah and they really made it theirs.
I liked their cover of Behind Blue Eyes
I think you might be the only one
Well it was a good rock cover of a pop song.
