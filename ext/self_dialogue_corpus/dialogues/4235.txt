I recently watched an older thriller movie from the early '90's with Michael Keaton called Pacific Heights. Have you ever heard of it?
I don't think I have. What's the movie about?
Michael Keaton plays a very slick conman who rents out an apartment in the Pacific Heights area and is basically the worst tenant ever. He makes the landlord, who are engaged couple, lives miserable.
Unfortunately, it doesn't sound like it would be that great of a movie. How is Michael Keaton at playing the villain?
Honestly, I think the movie is okay, but definitely nothing special. As far as Keaton, he was okay.
Are there plot twists or any thing crazy go down at all?
No, not really. The whole idea is learning just how much of a con artist his character really is.
I may consider checking that movie out, because I am a big fan of Michael Keaton.
I wouldn't say Pacific Heights is great, by any means. But it's not awful, either.
I'll have to give that one a watch one of these days and decide for myself then!
