I've recently noticed something about the Star Wars films.
What's that?
It seems like they're releasing a new film each year towards the end of the year.
I've noticed that too. It started in 2015 with The Force Awakens, right?
Yeah. Then in 2016 with Rogue One.
What's this years film again?
This year's film is going to be The Last Jedi.
What's it supposed to be about?
It's supposed to revolve more around Luke and Leia, I believe.
Oh, that sounds pretty good so far.
