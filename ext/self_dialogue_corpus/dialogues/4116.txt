Some thrillers, while not necessarily great, can also just go down as being fun. Case in point, From Dusk Till Dawn.
I do not think I have seen that movie. Could you fill me in the plot details?
Pretty basic plot of two criminals on the run who kidnap a father and his young children to help them escape to Mexico. On the way there, they stop at a bar and wind up trapped with vampires.
Sounds amusing. Is it quite over-the-top in terms of violence?
It is violent film, yes. That being said, I think it is so over-the-top it can actually be overlooked.
Isn't that a Quentin Tarantino movie?
Yes! So you already may have an idea of what to do expect.
I really like his movies and may consider giving From Dusk Till Dawn a watch.
I think you'll find it entertaining. While it is a thriller, there are also a fair amount of laughs.
That's good. I enjoy a good dark comedy with a scary movie.
