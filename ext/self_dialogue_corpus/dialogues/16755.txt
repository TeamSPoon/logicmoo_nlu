Are you a Jennifer Nettles fan?
I'm not sure. Who is she?
She used to be the lead singer of the group Sugarland, but she's done a lot of solo stuff the past few years.
I like Sugarland. I know who you mean.
Sugarland started in Atlanta and consisted of Jennifer Nettles, Kristen Hall, and Kristian Bush in the beginning.
Yeah, didn't Kristen quit the group a few years ago?
She did, "supposidley" to write more rather than performing.
Jennifer has a very noticeable voice.
I agree. I have followed her since about 2001 when she was still a part of the Jennifer Nettles Band, just before Sugarland.
Wow, that's a long time.
She was in another band before that called "Soul Miner's Daughter."
I think I remember hearing of that band. Didn't they have a kinda hippy vibe?
Sorta. They were excellent, and some of my favorite music is from them.
Didn't she have a baby recently?
She had a little boy about 3 years ago named Magnus.
That's a rather odd name for a child.
Yeah, I feel like motherhood has somewhat changed her music too.
Really? How?
The content and songs on her newest album are not as edgy and more subdued. I think there's even a song or two on it about being a mom.
Yeah, that sounds like a change.
