What about them Cowboys?
The expectations are going to be high this year.
They have a good young core of players and teams will be ready for them this year.
Dak played solid last year, but it will be interesting to see this new season.
It just seems like the Cowboys have a problem getting over the hump.
They really looked good last year.
Dak and Zeke are a good combo.  If they can run the ball and chip away at teams like last year, they should be okay.
The other nfl teams now have the tapes.  They are going to study up on Dak.  They are going to make it harder on him.
For him to step in last year and lead them was huge.  Not having Tony Romo looking over his shoulder could be good and bad.
People loved Romo, but for whatever reason, he couldn't show up when it counted.  I just hope Dak can get them over the hump.
Dak plays smart.  He is not throwing a bunch of interceptions.
Being safe with the ball got them lots of wins last year.  They just can't get behind.
Dak being the man now in Dallas means carrying all the weight.
He is a talent.  Dallas had to move on. He just has to win.  If he starts losing, the people will turn quick in Dallas and start talking about Romo.
Running the ball and controlling the clock is going to be their way forward.
It is hard to mess it up with Zeke running the ball.  Just hand it off and let him go to work.
I just think Dak is going to focus on hitting those open tight ends and wideouts to keep the chains moving.
They don't have to be complex.  Just keep it simple.  Chew the clock and put up points in the red zone.
The schedule for Dallas is going to be harder this year.  Dak and Zeke are going to have to rise to the occasion.
The Cowboys have a talented young group of players that should be good for years to come.
