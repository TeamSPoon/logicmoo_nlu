What was your favorite era of hip-hop.
90's for sure!
I'm going to have to agree with you there. It had some of the best rappers.
True. Who was your favorite rapper from the 90's?
Snoop Dogg.
He's in my top five. I would say my favorite is Digable Planets.
Who is that?
Well they're a group.
I have to give them a listen.
You won't regret it.
