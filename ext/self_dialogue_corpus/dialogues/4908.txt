Did you watch the game last night?
No, did it play on TV?
Yeah, I thought you knew?
No, I hadn't realized.  Who won?
We did, of course.
Awesome.  What was the score?
7-5.
Really?  That's a lot of runs.
Yeah, pitching sucked on both sides.
It sounds like it.
Plus each side had two errors.
Wow.  Where there any actual good hits are was it just bad defense?
Well, we had a few doubles, but really nothing.
That's crazy.  They don't even have a good pitching staff.
I know.  We struck out seven times.
Really?  That's pretty embarrassing.
Yeah, I'm sure they'll be spending some time in the batting cages after last night.
Sounds like they need time practicing pitching too.
The whole team needs practice.
I can't believe we won.
