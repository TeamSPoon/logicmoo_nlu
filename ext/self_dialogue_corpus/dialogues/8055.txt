Hey, what do you think of that new song by The Chainsmokers, "It Won't Kill Ya?"
I love that song, it's so catchy!
I know, it's probably my all time favorite song now!
It would be so cool if we could go to one of their concerts, I wonder when they'll be coming to our state?
I don't know, but I definitely think we should look into it.
I would die to see them live!
What would be the best time for you to go to a concert of theirs? Summer/Fall?
I think that an early Autumn would be a great time to go to the concert.
Alright, it's settled, we're going to see The Chainsmokers this September!
I am so excited, road trip!
