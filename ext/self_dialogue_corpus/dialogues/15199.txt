What do you think about the new Loerde album?
I think it's ok, I wasn't blown away by it though
I really, really, like it!  And pop music isn't usually my thing but I think this album is really good!
I do like how she does more experimentation on this album. I'll give her that.
I'm surprised by your lukewarm reaction. I thought you'd feel the same way I do.
I mean, its not terrible. Overall I'd say it's a good album but not an excellent one.
Personally, I'm blown away the whole album is electrifying. I actually get goosebumps on some songs.
I do appreciate her storytelling, I think she has a true gift for words.
Exactly, if she didn't pursue a career as a musician,I think she could have one as a writer.
Maybe she'll do both. It wouldn't be the first time a musician has crossed over into writing.
True, but I think she likes to use music and her voice to emphasize the words.
What's your favorite track?
Sober II (Melodrama), for sure. It is the perfect way to start closing out the album.
I liked that track a lot. I don't understand why she didn't end the album with that instead of Supercut and Perfect Places.
Yeah, she definitely should have switched the order. Supercut, then Perfect Places, and ending out with Sober II.
Well, she's still new to all of this, but I feel like a producer should have noticed that.
Yeah, it really distracts from the story she is trying to tell. What is your favorite track?
Probably Liability. I feel like it was so raw and full of emotion.
I completely agree, the lyrics are almost haunting.
I think she's really going to go far in the industry. She's got talent, I feel like she just needs to fine tune it a bit.
