We watched Bambi last night for the first time with my six year old niece.
Did she like it?
She liked Thumper the best.
Seems like most little girls like Thumper and Flower the best.
Boys tend to go to Bambi.
Or, Bambi's father.
I think many little girls sympathize with Flower.
I do too, I know I did.
She has such a cute little face.
That flower behind her ear is adorable, really makes her character.
