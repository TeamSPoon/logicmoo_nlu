I hate how the books deviate from the movies so much
I know they do not handle it well it goes from the source material so much
It is like they got the general idea but failed to follow through
Exactly
Their is so much needless exposition too
It just retreads stuff from the movies
It is sort of boring
Pretty much the movies covers the info too
I know i wish that they put the good parts into a movie though
What good parts?
