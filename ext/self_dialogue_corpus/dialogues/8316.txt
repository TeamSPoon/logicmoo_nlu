Have you heard the new Drake track yet?
I don't think so.
It is called Passionfruit.
Ok that is a fun song name.
Yes the song is special, he is a talented guy.
What does it sound like.
Like the song name, and the fruit, it is a very sweet track.
Ok I like the sound of that.
Yes it is mostly instrumental then he sings harmonious lyrics.
Ok I could see myself enjoying that, thank you for mentioning it.
