Did you hear that Roger Moore died?
Who is he again?
The actor. He acted as James Bond back in the day.
Hmmm Are you sure?
I'm 100% sure! I love James Bond! I've seen practically all of the movies!
Nah, I think you're mixing him up for Sean Connery...
Sean Connery was James Bond, you're right. But Roger Moore acting as James Bond right after.
Really?? I never knew that! Never even heard of him. I guess I didn't see all 10 of the James Bond movies..
There's way more than 10! There's actually over 20!
Oh wow! That's a lot! You've seen all of them you said?
No, but most. I've seen all but 5 or so.
Which ones are the best?
My favorite James Bond movies are Dr. No just because it was the first. Diamonds Are Forever. Live and Let Die. And Quantum of Solace.
Oh so you like Daniel Craig then?
I think he's good actually. Rugged. A different take on the role.
When is the next one coming out?
It supposed to be in 2019 I think? I'm not too sure actually.
I heard Daniel Craig won't be acting in it.
Nah, he will be. But It may be his last one. Rumour has it that Idris Elba will be taking over the role after that?
Wow! A black James Bond!
