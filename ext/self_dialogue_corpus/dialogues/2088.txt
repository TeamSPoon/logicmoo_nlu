I wish each state had an NFL team.
Why?
Because it's not fair that some states have multiple teams, while some have zero teams.
I don't think it matters.
Would you feel sad if your state didn't have at least one NFL team?
Well,, yeah.
So, I'm sure there are plenty of people in plenty of states who wish they had one.
I guess it would be cool to have more teams.
More teams, more players, more games.
The playoffs would be so ridiculous.
I'm glad your're beginning to see things my way.
Do you think this would be possible?
sure, first we take states that have multiple teams and we give them to a different state.
And then what?
And then we just make a few football teams each year until we have 50.
I think this could all get pretty messy.
Just because it could potentially be messy doesn't mean it wouldn't be worth it.
That's true, it just seems like it would be a lot of work.
I guess we should just be happy our states have NFL teams.
Now you're talking.
