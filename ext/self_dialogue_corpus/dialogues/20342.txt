Charlie Hunnam.
What has he played in?
He played in Sons of Anarchy, and also just made King of Arthur.
Oh wait, did he play Jax Teller in SOA?
Yes! He was the President of the biker club.
I have seen that show a few times.
It is a great show, he plays the part so well.
Have you seen him in King of Arthur yet?
No not yet.
I think that movie got really good reviews.
I would imagine so, Charlie is an amazing actor.
Anything else he played in?
I think he played in a show called Queer as Folk years ago.
I have not seen that show.
Neither have I, I hear he is in the process of making another movie as well.
Wasn't he supposed to play the lead role in 50 Shades of Grey?
Yes, but I am unsure if he passed on the part or what happened.
He would of played that part well considering the scenes I have seen in SOA.
I would definitely agree with you there!
