Do you hear 50 cent was working on a new album?
No, I didn't know he was still into music.
Yeah, he hasn't really done anything big in a while though.
I know.  I don't remember hearing anything from him in like ten years.
Well, he's had some releases since them.  Nothing really big though.
Yeah, I don't remember anything since Candy Shop and Magic Stick.
Yeah, he's been doing a lot of business stuff.
Hadn't he invested in a mineral water company?
Yeah, I think he had.
He did some acting and stuff too, I think.
