Want to help me design a dress for a competition I'm going to be in?
Sure. Any special criteria?
No. It can be any dress.
How about doing something with these cool watermelon shaped buttons I have?
Those are so cool? Where did they come from?
I saw them at a craft shop but never used them after I bought them. You may have them.
Thanks so much. They're so cute.
You're welcome. Let's do a red dress with some kind of black trim and those buttons.
That sounds amazing.
Do you actually sew it or just design it?
You actually make it.
Let's use something summery then, a light fabric.
I agree. Watermelon is a summer thing.
Yes. Want to go to the store for the materials together?
Yes. The deadline is in 30 days.
I can go whenever.
We need material and something for the black trim.
Not lace.
No, maybe just another kind of material.
This is going to be the cutest dress.
