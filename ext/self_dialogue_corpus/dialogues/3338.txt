Name your favorite horror movie?
I don't like horror movies.
None?
I've seen some but no, I don't like horror movies.
Wait a minute. Didn't you say you're a big fan of The Walking Dead?"
Yes, I am. My wife finds that hilarious too I like zombie shows and zombie movies.
But you don't like horror movies? How is that possible?
I don't know. I guess I like watching people kill zombies, or zombies kill people but I don't like seeing people kill people.
That's just wierd.
Yeah, I guess it is. But that's the way I am. I've dislike horror movies since I was a kid. I only saw my first zombie movie about ten years ago though.
