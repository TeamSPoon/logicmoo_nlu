I'd like to hear about the Miami Dolphins.
Sure.    What's your question.
What is Adam Case's thoughts on quarterback.
Case likes a steady quarterback who is a game manager.
Has that been a smooth transition?
Not really.     Ryan Tannehill has had a rough time with it.
I understand, but Jay Ajayi should help
He is definitely a strong back.
What about the loss of Arian Foster.
Shouldn't matter.     Foster was done before he retired.
Any thoughts on Julius Thomas
Great run in Denver, still needs to prove himself in Miami
What has that change been like for the passing game?
Jarvis Landry has also been having trouble with the transition.
OK, so what direction does the offense move in?
I see a reliance on the play-action pass.
That should be fun to watch.
Steady, but it might well be the best chance for success.
Will the Dolphins be a playoff team?
Outlook cloudy, but a definite possibility.
