Do you enjoy instrumental music?
Depends on what genre but I do in general.
Do you listen to much of Clint Mansell?
He does a lot of movie scores correct?
Yea, he has worked a lot with Aronofsky.
Oh yea, of course.  The Fountain Soundtrack is amazing.
I know right, Death is the Road to Awe is a masterpiece.
I could listen to that all day..
It is so calming and yet so epic at the same time.
Every time I hear it, it reminds me of the movie.
Yea, same with the score for Requiem.
Requiem for a Dream?  Was that also his work?
Yea, not quite as good but still a great listen.
I do not even remember much about the music in that movie.
There were a handful of good songs but nothing like The Fountain.
That whole album is just amazing.
Did you hear that he is not doing the music for the new Aronofsky?
Is this the first movie without him?
Yea it is, I am not sure why.
That is sad to hear, I love both of them.
