Do you like any of Taylor Swift's music?
Oh I love her song "Shake it Off!"
Oh yes that is my ultimate fave!
I would listen to it over and over when it first came out.
I did that too. Then I started to get tired of it.
Do you know who Alessia Cara is?
I do! I especially like her song "Scars to Your Beautiful."
I love it! I think it is a great message for young girls.
I totally agree with you.
Young girls needs to hear those kind of lyrics.
