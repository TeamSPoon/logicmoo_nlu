I liked the new star wars movie. How about you?
It was good but I wish Han Solo hadn't died at the end.
I know. It was really sad but also a powerful scene.
Do you think Kylo Ren will remain on the dark side or do you think Rey can bring him back?
I hope he can be redeemed like Darth Vader. He seemed conflicted at times so maybe he still has some good in him.
The movie raised so many questions and left us with such a cliffhanger. I Wish they had told us more about how Kylo Ren ended up the way he did.
I agree. And what was with that scene where he talked to Darth Vader's remains. It was weird.
They had a chance to give us more insight into what drove Kylo towards the dark side of the force but they just left me confused.
Hopefully the next movie "The last Jedi" will answer some of the questions they raised in the Force Awakens.
I wonder if Finn also has the force.
