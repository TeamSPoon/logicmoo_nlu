Hey Have you heard the new Megadeth album?
No i have not had a chance yet to listen to it. Is it any good?
It is awesome so far it is album of the year for me.
My album of the year last year was Thrawsunblat
Never heard of them?
They are a band from Canada you should check them out they are spectacular.
I might give them a go sometime here since you like them so much.
Most definitely it is somewhat different
How is it different
It mixes multiple genres together
It does that sounds pretty interesting.
It is very interesting i honestly want to see them live.
That would be pretty cool

That is not good you should go more
I know but i have been up to alot of things
