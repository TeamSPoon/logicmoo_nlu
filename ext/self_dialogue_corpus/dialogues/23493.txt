What did you think about 'Star Wars: The Force Awakens?'
I loved it so much.  Yourself?
I liked it a lot.  What do you think about the criticism that it was too similar to 'A New Hope?'
I'd say that, while they were extremely similar, this newest one brought enough different elements to make it a fresh take.
Who was your favorite character?
I really liked Rey.
You didn't think she was a bit too good at everything?
How so?
It just seems like she never really faced any issues.  She's good at everything.
I see where you're coming from, but I think that even if she has many skills, it doesn't make her challenges any easier to overcome.
That's fair.
Did you like anything about it?
Yes, I still enjoyed the movie.  Also, Daisy Ridley is just a phenomenal actress.
She really is.  I can't believe that this was her first major role in a film.
I had no idea.  I'm that much more impressed after hearing that.
I think similar to how the original cast consisted of relatively unknown actors, this movie also debuted some new faces.
I think all those actors have bright futures ahead.  Oscar Isaac and John Boyega were great in their roles too.
I agree.  I can't wait for Episode 8.
Same here.  'Rogue One' helped satiate me in the meantime.
I loved that one too.  'Star Wars' is such an awesome saga.
