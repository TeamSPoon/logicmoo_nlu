Who is your favorite Star Wars Character?
Luke Skywalker of course.  He is the hero and the strongest.
I like Yoda because I thought he was the strongest.
Well, I guess at u til he died, he was.
I hope Luke is the strongest ever with the force in the next movie
Me to, I hope he just kicks butt.
I also like Chewbacca.
You can't forget Chewy!  He is the man.
What about Jar Jar Binks?
I know your kidding on that one!
