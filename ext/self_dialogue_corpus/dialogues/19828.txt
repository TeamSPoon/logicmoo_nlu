Have you ever seen Rush?
Yes. I'm actually a big fan.
How many times have you seen them live?
Many times. More than five.
When did you first see them live?
Back in the 1980s.
Which tour?
I think it was Hold Your Fire. It might have been Power Windows.
That's a long time ago!
Indeed. Over thirty years now.
What other bands do you like?
Pretty much ones in the same vein as Rush. Power rock.
How about progressive rock? Isn't that similiar?
Somewhat. I do like progressive groups as well.
Such as?
Yes, ELP, Triumvirat. Those types of 1970s groups.
Did you ever get the chance to see any of those groups?
Only ELP. And that was back in the very early 1990s.
Neat! How did you like it?
It was as great as I expected!
