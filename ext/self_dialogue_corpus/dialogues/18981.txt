Were you ever into Whitney Houston?
I grew up on her. She was my favorite singer for a while.
Mine too. Such a great voice, it's tragic what happened to her.
I agree. What's your favorite song by her?
Probably Run to You off the Bodyguard soundtrack.
That is a pretty song but I Will Always Love You is my favorite
She won so many awards. Did you see the tv movie based on her life?
Yes I did and the woman playing her did a great job.
I saw that and the New Edition story. Her and Bobby Brown had a crazy relationship.
Yes they did. I remember they did a song together a while back.
Right I think it was called Something in Common.
That was it. Him and the rest of New Edition were done so wrong at the beginning.
Right that's what happens when you don't read contracts.
What's your favorite New Edition song?
When Will I See You Smile Again. That's a classic.
Yes it is but I have to go further back with Mr. Telephone Man.
The old school song I like from them the best is Is This The End?
That's a beautiful song. Ralph Trezvant had such a sweet voice.
He really did. Johnny Gill came into the group and really upgraded them though.
Oh he definitely had the best voice of them all.
