What is your favorite Britney Spears song?
I love Toxic.
Oh me too. It's such a great song to dance too.
Exactly. Plus it's aged well.
Very true. I really like Oops I Did It Again.
Oh that's a solid song.
Yeah, it was pretty good to dance to in middle school.
You know, I used to know the moves from the chorus.
Oh nice! I only knew moves for Hit Me Baby One More Time.
Hey that's still very impressive!
