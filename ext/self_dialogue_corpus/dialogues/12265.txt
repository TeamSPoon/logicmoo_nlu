Did they reuse the Darth costume for the prequels.
I don't think so.
Why wouldn't they?
I read that the original helmet was flawed.
In what way?
Something to do with it not being semetrical.
How about the rest of the suit.
They would have had to alter it at least.
I don't see why....
Because Hayden was wearing it.
