Hey! Did you get around to seeing Manchester by the Sea?
Oh my god, I did! It was brutally sad! Did you like it?
I did even though I was crying through the whole thing.
Yeah, I didn't really like it because it was so sad.
But that's the beauty of it!
I guess I'm just not a sad movies type of person. I prefer comedies.
I thought Casey Affleck did a really good job in it.
I did too.
I'm glad he won the Oscar for it.
Oh he did? I didn't realize.
Yeah he did! I also loved that it was set close to Boston.
Yeah, you don't see a lot of movies set in Boston.
What did you think of the soundtrack?
I thought it was good! Definitely made it more sad though.
I agree. That scene in the police station is brutal.
I know! What did you think of the ending?
I mean it wasn't totally satisfying but I think that's the point.
I don't know. I was pretty disappointed by it.
It sounds like you like movies with really happy endings.
Yeah, which is why Manchester by the Sea wasn't really for me.
