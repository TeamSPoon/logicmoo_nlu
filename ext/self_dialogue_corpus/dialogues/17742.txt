Do you like to listen to music often?
Yes I like it a lot!
How do you typically listen to music?
I usually listen to it in my car.
Do you use CD's, an iPod, the radio?
I do a little bit of them all. I really enjoy listening to Sirius XM.
Why's that?
I like it because they have so many different stations and each one is a different genre.
Really? Wow. That is nice.
Yeah. They have a couple different stations for each genre.
Interesting.
They also divide the music by decade and it is all commercial free.
I love that! I might have to get that. I typically listen to CD's.
CD's are great too. Any way you can is helpful. Listening to music in the car is the best.
It really is. It makes the time go by a lot faster on my commute.
Me too! I like to listen to music on my way to work. It makes me less tired in the morning.
Same, if it weren't for the music I listen to in the morning I would probably fall asleep on my way to work!
I like to listen to more relaxing music in the morning and more upbeat fun songs on my way home from work.
I pretty much just always listen to country music!
I love country!
