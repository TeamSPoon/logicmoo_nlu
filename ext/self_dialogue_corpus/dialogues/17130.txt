Who is your favorite singer?
I like Billy Joel.
Isn't he married to Christie Brinkley?
He was for about nine years but isn't now.
His daughters and her just did a modeling job together I saw it on TV.
Yes, they are all very pretty.
Which of his songs do you like?
I like a lot of his songs but I think Allentown is my favorite?
I can relate to that song to.
I've been layed off from work many times I have felt that way.
"Storm Front" was a good album.
I like the song We Didn't Start the Fire.
I think he should do a new version with updated news.
That would be cool.
His songs remind me of growing up in America.
I used to like to listen to Captain Jack and The Piano Man.
Kind of depressing songs.
Yes, but I like them.
I used one of his songs in my wedding.
Let me guess was it Just The Way You Are?
