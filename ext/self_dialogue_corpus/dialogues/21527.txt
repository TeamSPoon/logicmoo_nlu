What did you think about Mississippi Grind?
It was much better than I had expected. I'm surprised at how little recognition it got.
Yeah, I think it was really underrated by audiences.
I think Mendelsohn's character is one of the realest I've seen onscreen so far.
Watching him with Ryan Reynolds was mesmerizing at times.
I know, a lot of people really only look at Ryan as some goofball, but he's a good all around actor.
I think so.
I think what did it in for mass audiences is that it is a little slow. Most people don't have the patience for that.
Agreed. It more of a character study than a fast paced what's gonna happen next type of movie.
Exactly.
Did you know that Jake Gyllenhaal was originally cast as Curtis?
No, I didn't. What happened with that?
He had a scheduling conflict, so he had to drop it.
Nothing against him, but I'm glad it was Ryan Renyolds and not Jake Gyllenhaal.
Me too. I don't if  Jake Gyllenhaal could have pulled it off.
No, I don't think he could.
Has  Ben Mendelsohn  been in a lot of movies? I'm interested to see more of his work.
He's actually been in a lot of things, he usually plays a villain or some sort of bad guy.
What might I know him from?
Well he played "Pope" in Animal Kingdom.
