Do you prefer the music of the Beatles as a band or as individual solo artists?
I like them both but if I had to choose it would be the Beatles as a band.
Who was your favorite member of the Beatles?
My answer would be Paul McCartney. Great voice, innovative bass player, amazing songwriter who could write in so many styles.
If John Lennon had lived, do you think the Beatles would have re-united?
I do. In today's economy, they would have made hundreds of millions to do a reunion tour and with that would be an album, a dvd and so on, they would have made a fortune !
What was your favorite Beatle album?
So hard to pick one ! But you can't go wrong by owning Rubber Soul .
Have you ever seen any of the Beatles in concert?
Yes, I was lucky enough to see Paul McCartney at Fenway park. What a show !!
