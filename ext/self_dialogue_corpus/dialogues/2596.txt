I just saw highlights from Superbowl IX.
Who played?
Pittsburgh Steelers and the Minnesota Vikings.
I know the Vikings never won a Superbowl.
Right, this was Pittsburgh's first Superbowl victory.
Who were the quarterbacks?
Terry Bradshaw for Pittsburgh and Fran Tarkenton for Minnesota.
Where did they play?
Tulane Stadium, New Orleans.
Not the Superdome?
It was not ready.
Who scored in the first quarter?
No score in the first quarter and only 2 in the second.
Wow, a safety.  Who played at halftime?
Grambling State band with Duke Ellington's son.
Classier than modern shows.
Pittsburgh finally scored a touchdown in the third quarter.
When did the Vikings score?
Fourth quarter, missed point after, 9-6.
Too bad.  I liked Fran Tarkenton.
