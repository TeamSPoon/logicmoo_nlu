Do you like the Beatles much?
I guess so, I mean they're pretty old aren't they? I do like Hey Jude, though.
It's funny that I'm not that old, but they're such a part of my childhood anyway. I mean I wasn't even alive in the sixties.
When was the first time you heard them?
Actually, we sung Octopus's Garden when I was in third grade for an elementary school performance.
Cute!
Yeah, and when I was in high school I played Eleanor Rigby for the orchestra.
Does it translate well into classical music?
You wouldn't think so, but it does. It sounds gentler and very symphonic.
I guess that's why their music endures--it's so versatile, and so mold-able.
