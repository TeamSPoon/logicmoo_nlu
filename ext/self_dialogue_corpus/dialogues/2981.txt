Man that pass was good
Yeah he aced it
I wonder how they get so good
What do you mean
You  know at their passing
I am not sure
Like it's just something I've wondered
Makes sense to wonder
Yeah like did they learn or what
I am sure their is more to it
Like what
I am not sure
Why
Because I do not know
Maybe natural talent?
That is a possibility
It is likely to be honest
Hm?
Cannot learn to throw for the broncos like that
True enough
