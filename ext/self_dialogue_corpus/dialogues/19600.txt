How's your Franz Liszt dissertation going?
I quit.
Why? You love his music.
I'm just not good enough from a music theory standpoint. I have nothing new to offer.
Aren't you applying voice-leading and transformational graphs to discuss the harmonic areas?
Yeah, but I'm not able to keep up. I use techniques that are new to me, but actually five years old.
Really?
Yeah, I presented at the New England Conference of Music Theorists last fall.
You told me about that, it didn't go well, right?
Yeah, it was bad. They said "It's a shame you didn't use the techniques we have."
WOW, jerks. How'd you respond?
I said how I didn't like the three-dimensional models. They seemed to take offense.
Why is that?
Well, those analytical techniques are specific to Harvard, Yale, Princeton, and Eastman.
So?
I used techniques that originated from Chicago, their competition.
Ahh, a music theory turf war.
Yup, a bunch of "need attention graduate students" who were saying "I just learned about this technique last term, did you use it?"
Ha, snobs. How'd you respond?
I said "No, I am allowed to not like it. I chose what works for me and how I view the music."
