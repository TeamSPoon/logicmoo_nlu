Man, How about the playoffs this year?
I know right.  But it feels repetitive anymore.
I agree.  It is always Golden State and Cleveland
Yeah, though this year they haven't made it yet.
Yeah, but they will.  No one can stand up to either team.
Basketball has about become unwatchable because players just join teams to play with the best, not against them.
Everyone wants their championship. Ya know?
I understand.  It just makes it boring to watch sometimes.
So who do you have winning it all?
I think Cleveland was a fluke in the Championship last year.  So I have Golden State
Yeah me too.  Plus I just can't stand LeBron.
I actually like him.  I wouldn't say he is the goat, but he is dang good.
I don't doubt his talents.  It is his flopping and constant complaining.
Yeah, he is very bad about that.  He would make a great Soccer player!
No doubt!  All that flopping around.
How many games do you think the finals will go?
I am going 6 games. Golden State 4-2
I agree on Golden State winning it.  But I have it 4-3 in 7 games.
It very well could end like that again.
It would at least make it somewhat interesting!
