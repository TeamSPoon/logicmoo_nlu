It's a good thing you didn't get me those Yankees tickets for my birthday.
Why is that? Because they were so expensive?
No, because they lost!
Oh yeah, right, that was pretty brutal.
That's why I love the Astros. I think they're the best team in the league right now.
Better than the Yankees? You're a traitor to your team!
Haha. I think Carlos is great. Did you see that two-run home run he made?
Carlos who? Who are you talking about.
Carlos Correa, number one on the Astros
Oh yeah I saw the run but I forgot his name. Guess I better start paying attention to them though.
Yeah you should, they're gonna be contenders this year for sure.
They almost were contenders last year, but they had some bad luck.
Yeah Correa got a shoulder injury and was out for awhile.
I saw the way he dives for the ball, always lands right on his shoulder. That's very risky.
Jose Altuve is great too, he's their golden boy. But I think Correa is gonna outshine him eventually.
The game was rained out today. It was supposed to be a double header.
Yeah and it was Derek Jeter night too.
Traffic is gonna be chaos in the Bronx tonight!
That's another reason I'm glad we didn't get tickets this weekend.
Exactly, I'm not up for taking two hours to get out of the parking lot at the stadium after the game!
