Did you ever watch Lady and the Tramp?
I used to love that movie when I was a kid!
Have you seen it recently?
Not in the past ten years. Why are you asking?
It's such a strange movie now that we're older.
How is it strange?
It's just a different movie. It just seems so outdated now.
In what way is it outdated?
I think Lady's owners are just so old fashioned it's silly.
I guess that makes sense considering when it was made.
