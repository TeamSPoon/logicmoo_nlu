So then what else did he use? What was it penta something
Pentatonic scales. Pentatonic scales are found in virtually all civilizations, including western civlilzation.
So what are they?
Well, they're scales comsisting only of 5 notes.
Out of an octave?
Well they have the whole tonal centers and everythign so yes out of an octave in that sense, but an octave has 8 notes.
Um.I'm confused
An octa means 8. An octave can be reached if you climb up 8 notes in the standard scale. pentatonic scale have 5 notes
So how do they divide an octave into five notes?
Only play 5 notes out of the 8
