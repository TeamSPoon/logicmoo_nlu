It's been out for a while
I know, I just never got around to watching it.
Why?
What do you mean why?
Woah, calm down. I was just wanting to know why.
Oh, I guess the text suggests I was annoyed at the question. I really was just trying to get you to clarify your question.
Did the trailer turn you off from the movie?
Well, I did not see anything captivating in the trailer.
Not gonna lie, the trailer did not do it justice.
That is good to know.
Yes, just check it out.
It's on netflix right?
Of course, everything is on Netflix.
You are correct about that.
I know I am.
I guess I will check it out.
You definitely should.
Especially since it has one of my favorite actors?
Who, Samuel L. Jackson?
No, Kurt Russell.
