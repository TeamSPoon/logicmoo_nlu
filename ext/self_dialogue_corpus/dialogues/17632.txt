What type of music are you a fan of?
I am interested in rock and metal.
Oh okay. So you have heard of Disturbed then?
Yes, I have heard of them.
Yeah they are very good,
I do enjoy them.
Yeah, they've been around a while.
They have been.
Tey seem to have made a sort of comeback though.
Oh? How so?
Well they helped to make the soundtrack for the Hobbit series that recently came out,
Oh really? I did not know.
Yes, they came out with The sound of Silence for the movie.
Oh I have heard that. Slow, but very good.
Yeah, it was very well done and fit well with the theme.
Seemed like it.
Yes the sound of silence was sort of the unofficial theme for the whole series.
Yes, it did seem that way.
They have also came out with a lot of other good music. Down with the sickness was good, and they also contributed to the Transformers sound track.
Yes, they are very good.
