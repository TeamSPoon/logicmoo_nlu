Are you a fan of Nicki Minaj?
I honestly think she's great. Her lyrics are very well thought out.
People tend to either love her or hate her.
I think a lot of people are jealous. She's showing the world she's just as good as anyone else.
True. Numbers don't lie.
You always see her with a hit single out. Consistency like that isn't easy.
Yeah, you have to respect that.
The beat that they used in "Anaconda" was genius.
Is that the one with the recycled "Baby Got Back" samples?
Yeah, that song is very creative and so is her performance of it.
