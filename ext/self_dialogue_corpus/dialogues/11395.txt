I didn't like the Beatles until I was an adult and discovered the song Rocky Racoon
That's funny. That is not one of their more popular songs.
I also like when they had their songs on that rockstar game
Oh, I liked that too. Especially she's so heavy.
Strawberry fields in a nice song as well.
I like to zone out and drive to that one.
What do you think of imagine?
I think it is a perfect song.
My birthday is the same day as Paul McCartneys
I don't like Wings as much as the Beatles.
