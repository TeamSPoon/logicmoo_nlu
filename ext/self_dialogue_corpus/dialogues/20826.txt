What's your favorite David Fincher movie?
That's a hard one to decide he has so many good ones Gone Girl, Seven, Fight Club
Yeah but if you had to narrow it down to one.
I would have to go with the 1997 film The Game!
I have never heard of that one who is in it.
Michael Douglas with a small part by Sean Penn
I like Michael Douglas, what is the movie about?
Sean Penn plays Michael Douglas' brother and buys him what seems to be a innocent birthday gift.
That doesn't sound very interesting at all.
The plot seems very basic but it has some real twist and turns that make you wonder what's really going on
So it's a mystery movie?
Kind of. I would describe as more of a suspense type of film with some thriller elements.
This is starting to sound more interesting. Does it have that signature David Lynch look?
Absolutely! It's very warm and has a strong noir vibe to it.
So does it have a good ending?
It has a really good ending. You will not see it coming
How long is the film?
A little over 2 hours.
Has it been released on Blu-Ray?
Yeah! You definitely want to watch this in high definition.
