Hi.
Hello.
Do you like the NFL?
Yeah sure.  You?
Yeah I love it.
That's cool.  I think I like college a bit more than the nfl.
Why is that?
I don't know, I guess it seems to mean more.
Like what school spirit or something?
I guess.
I can sort of see that.
Why do you like the NFL?
I like how good the players are.
That all?
I also like how, for the most part, teams compete with each other equally.
I can see that.
Yeah, sometimes in college you don't get that.
That's true.
Good talking to you.
You too.
