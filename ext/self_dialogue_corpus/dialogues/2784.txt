So, do you think Colin Kapernick is done with football?
Well, he's a free agent and no team has picked him up so far.
I think with a month left it would be hard to just "show up and play"
True.
Plus i think he does not want to play anymore.
You think?
Yeah, he's off to "go find himself"
It too bad, he had talent, i can see him getting forgotten real quick.
HA! That's true.
It's happened before.
It's funny i was thinking about that 49'ers/Rams game where he ran the 2 pt conversion in.
Oh yeah, that was great.
He kept looking like he was gonna pass it and just leaped it in.
Yes and the 49'ers interception right after that play won the game.
Yeah, i just can't see why kapernick would walk away from all of that.
Well, like i said he wants to go find himself.
Hopefully if he returns it will be like Dave Chappell... just slide back in.
I don't think it will be that easy for him.
One can always hope.
Agreed.
