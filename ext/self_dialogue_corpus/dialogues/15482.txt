Hey Pete, what's that you're listening to?
What?
I said what's that you are listening to...on your computer?
Yes, I'm on my computer.
I know that. That's why I asked, "what you are listeing to ON YOUR COMPUTER?"
What? Do you need to be on this computer?
NO, I asked what are you listening to!  What music are you listening to?
Yeah. I'm listening to music.
Dude, you are brain dead?
Grateful Dead? Yeah, I love 'em, but that's not what I'm listening to...
Thanks for that wealth of information.  There's no point in me asking a follow-up question.
What?
I said there's no point in me asking another question.
You say you've got an appointment with affliction? That can't be good.
Yes Pete. I am afflicted with your friendship.
I love you too buddy!  Hey, you want to listen to my computer?
That depends on what you are listening to.
Let me take my headphones off. I can't hear you over my Billy Joel station.
Oh, so that's what you're listening to... Billy Joel. Why didn't you just say so!
Dude, I just did. Weren't you listening?
