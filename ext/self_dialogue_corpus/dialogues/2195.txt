So do you think that the Browns have any chance of ending the season at .500?
Man, I don't think so, even with their draft picks this year I just don't see that happening.
Yeah, I agree.
Also, they need to get their quarterback situation figured out.
Yeah they do! They haven't had someone that they can rely on to run the offense in so long.
And they need to find a head coach that they can stick with for a long time.
Yeah, I think that they should've stuck with Mike Pettine back when they had him.
Yeah, I don't get why they didn't stick with him. I think that he could've really done something with the team if given more of a chance.
Yeah, the front office doesn't ever seem to give head coaches much of a chance.
They have no patience!
I also feel really bad for Joe Thomas. That man has been so dedicated to the team his whole career.
Yeah I know! They guy hasn't even seen the playoffs since he's been in the league.
He has a chance to be a hall of famer.
Yeah he does! I just hope that someday he's able to at least make it into the playoffs somehow.
I honestly would be happy if they could go 4-12 this season.
Yeah me too, but I don't even know if that's realistic.
How many wins do you think they can get this year?
I say maybe two or three games. Three might even be pushing it.
Well, I guess we'll see. I still say that they can get four wins.
I'm still sticking with two or three.
