What is the latest movie you want to see in the theater?
I'm not sure there are so many to pick from.
I think summer time always have all new movie coming out for kid to watch.
Yeah, they always have at least one animated one severl action movie and of course those horror movie as well.
I personally want to watch the new Despicable Me movie.
Oh, I love those minions.  They are so cute.
Yeah, they are so cute but I was disappointed couple years back when they have the minion movie  They are not as good as what I wanted.
I had watch that too and I agreed with you that they didn't do it as great as they could.
The story line is just not strong enough but I do like how they incoporate the different thing in differnt time.
Yeah, that was cute when they have the tie dye shirt like the Hippie.
I wish the story line is tronger though.
By the way do you remember which animated studio is the one doing that movie?  Is it Dreamwork?  I don't think it's Pixar.
I'm not sure either but I think it's Dreamwork.
I thinkt that got to be the same on did the other animated movie called the Scret lives of Pets.
I think so.  When talk about that movie, I don't like that one at all.
I haven't watch that one but why you do not like it?
You think the minion movie has a weak story line wait until you watch the Scret lives of Pets.  It is even weaker.
Really?  The trailer was good.
The trailer sure is good but that's all the good in the movie.
Wow, that sounds disappointing.
