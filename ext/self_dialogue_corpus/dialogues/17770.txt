I've heard that the light rock genre is making a comeback.
Really? What artists fall into that music category?
Artists like Michael McDonald and Kenny Loggins.
Wow, I love those guys!
Me too. You know any similar sounding artists?
I'm more into bands.
Well, you know any light rock bands?
Sure! There's America, Ambrosia, and Toto.
I love Toto!
It's a shame about the Porcaro brothers.
Yes, Steve's the only one left.
I'm glad the band is still going, though.
Steve uses it as therapy. Music has that effect on people.
Are there any studies showing that effect?
Definitely! A recent study showed that music helped people recover from stroke.
Wow, that's amazing!
It is. Music is also being used to help people with dementia.
I can see that. Will music help prevent the body from decaying?
I'm not sure about that, but I know that dancing does.
Wow, music is a lot more important than I realize.
