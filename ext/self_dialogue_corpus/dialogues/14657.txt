Have you been watching the playoffs?
Only when they are on TNT.
Don't you have direct TV?
Yeah but I don't have the sports package.
Don't even get espn then?
No but I still get to watch some games.
It is kinda lame the same teams look like they are going to the finals.
I know, I wish Cleveland and Golden State would lose.
I don't think they will, maybe the Spurs can win.
No way without Tony Parker they are toast against the Warriors.
Probably, I wish the Rockets would have won.
Me too, their bench really forgot to show up.
Yeah, I thought Lou Williams was a great pickup but he was invisible.
Maybe Boston or Washington can Pull off an upset.
Not a chance, they both suck.
Anyone can win, you just need a couple shooters to get hot.
Except you need a couple of shooters, who can compete with the three shooters of the big two?
Beal maybe, I think Boston wins at home though.
That's how it has gone so far, home team wins.
I hope it is a triple overtime fiasco.
