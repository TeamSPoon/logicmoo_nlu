Are you seeing Alex G next week?
Alex G? What genre is that?
He's sort of a lo-fi artist.
I'll have to check him out.
He just released a new album a week or so ago.
Oh yeah? What's it called?
Rocket. It's very diverse to say the least.
Different kinds of genres diverse?
Yeah. He even has a country-ish song called "Bobby" on it.
Oh wow. And this is from a lo-fi artist.
Yeah. It's crazy to say the least.
That is crazy. How long has he been around for?
I want to say at least four or so years. All of his albums are nice.
What would you say is his best one?
That's such a tough question. I don't think I can rank them.
I'm excited to check them out.
Yeah, tell me what you think of them.
Are they on Spotify?
Yeah, I believe all of them are actually!
Awesome. Checking them out now.
