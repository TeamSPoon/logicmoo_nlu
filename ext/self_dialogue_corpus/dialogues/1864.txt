Who do you think will win the NFC North?
The packers always seem to be the best team
Aaron Rodgers is the GOAT
No way, elway was better and has more rings
What do rings prove Eli manning has 2 and he's not even Elite
The NFC East will be awesome this year
The cowboys should still be running away with it I think
Eagles picked up some good WRS for wentz though
Plus the redskins..
What was the deal with their GM
Apparently he was a drinker
Like that should disqualify someone from working in the National Football League
Anyways back to the north I'm looking to get a bet down
I'll give you the field against the packers
That's a bet
Anything else you like?
Rams under 6 wins
Those guys are gonna be terrible!
Poor Todd gurley
At least he gets all the Carl's Jr. he can eat
