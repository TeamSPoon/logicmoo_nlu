Remember when Aaliyah passed away?
Who are you talking about?
You know, Aaliyah? She was a famous artist in the 90's and early 2000s?
Oh right! I had forgotten about her.
She was amazing.
When did she end up passing away again?
It was 2001. I still remember that day because I was in my freshman English class.
That's so sad. She had such an amazing voice.
Yes she was definitely one of a kind.
Which of her songs was your favorite?
I think one of them was "Are You That Somebody".
Yes that was a good one!
My friends and I would sing and dance to that at school.
I remember she played in a movie do you remember the name.
Yes it was called "Queen of the Damned."
Right! It was kind of a weird movie.
It was but she did a great job. She looked hot in it.
I agree. Now I kind of want to look at it to see her.
Me too. Should we rent it or look it up?
Sure why not, sounds like a good idea.
