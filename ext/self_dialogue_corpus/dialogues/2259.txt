Are you excited for the preseason?
I usually am after such a long break.
It's a good chance to see the rookies play for sure.
I think that for a lot of teams it's a really important tool to figure out your team.
It seems every year a player or two has a great preseason and gets a starting job.
Watching rookie quarterbacks is my favorite part.
I want to see how Trubisky does with the Bears.
They gave up so much to get him he's going to have a lot of pressure on him.
And the fans of the bears weren't a fan of the move either.
He's going to have to have a hot start to win the fans over.
He was pretty good in college I think he will be fine.
I think he'll be fine too just needs a little time.
They have Howard now to give him some relief in the running game.
If he picks up the playbook he could be worth the trade.
Yeah I agree if they found a franchise QB any price is worth it.
There's only so many great QBs out there got to do whatever it takes to get them.
Look how long the Browns have been trying.
It's been forever since they had a good quarter back.
They missed on Weeden and a bunch of others.
Johnny Football was a pretty big bust too.
