Here's a story of a man named Brady.....
No.
Oh come on, why not?
Because Miami does not have to play them in regular season until December.
I know, but whay the lack of love for Tom Brady?
I'm just burnt out over the New England Dynasty.
Why burned out?
Because it seem like no other QB can put a patch on him and all for different bad reasons.
So Tom Brady can't be "Just that good"?
I think Cam Newton needs to knock him off his pedistal.
No one other than Cam has a shot?
Matt Ryan maybe.
What about RG III?
No, he's more hype than hope.
I know, i know..... Aaron Rodgers!
Please, stop. Another hype artist.
Drew Brees.
Now there is a possibility. But that would mean the saints would dominate the division and that would be bad for Tampa.
Well if it means the demise of the Brady career......
I hear ya.... i'm on the fence with that one.
