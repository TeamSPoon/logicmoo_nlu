Have you seen Gladiator?
The old movie?
Yes that one.
Yes I did why?
Do you think it was an accurate interpretation of the times?
I think it was more accurate than most but it's hard to say since we don't really know what it was like.
I just love the story of the man who stands up against an empire and fights back.
Yeah it's a true david vs goliath story.
I also love how he had to prove himself against all odds up to the very end.
Didn't he fight a lion too?
I believe so.
I seem to recall that.
He had to fight his way through so much to get close to the ruthless king.
Wasn't he injured too?
Yes the king weakened him because he knew he couldn't defeat him fairly plus he just wanted it over with but quietly not to damage his reputation.
Do you think this is a true story?
I think so but it's hard saying if they were just stories or if it really happened.
Fair enough.
Wonder if they will ever do a remake of the movie?
I doubt it.
