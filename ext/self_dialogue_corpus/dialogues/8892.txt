Bob Dylan is probably the greatest songwriter ever.
I don't think there's any debate.
He's pretty much written a good percentage of every classic song.
He's still making some pretty good music.
I haven't heard any of his latest stuff.. So it's pretty good?
Yep, you'll never have another classic, but it's quality stuff.
How's his voice sound?
You can tell he's getting old.  His voice flutters a bit.
Guess that's bound to happen when you're pushing 80 years old.
But at least he's still out there doing it.
