Do you listen to All Songs Considered on NPR?
Yes I've discovered all sorts of music through that show.
Like who?
Um. Anderson Paak.
Yep. I heard him on their first
I also like the Tiny Desk Concerts
Yes! I loved this years winners.
The Tank and the Bangas are great.
I also liked the Avett Brothers performance.
Right. I don't like them usually but that was good.
Roomful of Teeth was good in that space too
Yes. I liked seeing them.
I love Tegan and Sara
I think I first heard them on all songs considered too
Living room is such a great song
For sure. I also like Le Tigre.
Me too.
Riot Grrl music is great.
I wish Carrie Brownstein would put out a solo album
Oh that would be killer.
