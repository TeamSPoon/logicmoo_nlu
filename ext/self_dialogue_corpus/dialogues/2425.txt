Do you think the Brown's will be the worst team in the NFL this season?
I don't know. They made some nice moves in the draft.
They did but it is a long term strategy. They will grow over the next couple seasons.
At least they didn't waste any more picks on quarterbacks.
It will be interesting to see how Brock Osweiler performs in Cleveland.
Where was he before he got traded?
I think he was in Houston.
That is right. He did alright down there.
It is tough being a Brown's fan.
At least we have good company. I heard Lebron James has season passes.
If Myles Garrett comes back strong from his injury we may have a chance at a win this year.
I heard that one of the rookie QB's might start over Osweiler.
Maybe Kizer or Kessler. If they do they wasted a trade on Osweiler.
That is typical of the Browns.
Are you going to any games this season?
I might go to one or two games.
I have not decided yet if I will. Tickets are really cheap this season.
Not as many season pass holders this year for the Browns.
Hue Jackson will turn things around for the Browns.
If he doesn't they will fire him.
