Who are your top 5 favorite rappers of all time?
Kanye, Drake, Tupac, Nas and Kendrick Lamar and if I had to add one more person I would add Chuck D of Public Enemy.
while, I think we have the same taste.  I would just throw Biggie in there in place of Drake.  Drake is in my top 10, but not my top 5.
Who are your top 5 female rappers of all time?
Lauren Hill, Little Kim, Foxy Brown, Remy Ma and The Real Roxanne...lol..
ok I agree, but I also love Queen Latifah, Salt and Peppa and Nicki Minaj.
So are any of the ladies in your top 5?
Yes, Laura Hill, she was so great she was so smooth.   She could sing and rap, she was one of the greatest rappers period.
I agree, I got back and listen to her old stuff all the time, she was pretty impressive and could hold her own among these male rappers.
I would love to see something with Lauren Hill and Kendrick.
