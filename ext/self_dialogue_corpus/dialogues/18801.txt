Do you like Queen?
I love queen.
Me too, they were awesome before Freddy kicked it.
I know, taken too  young from us that's for sure.
He was maybe the best singer I've ever heard.
Yeah, like when singing Barcelona.
Yes, or Somebody to love.
Or Bohemian Raphsady.
What was your favorite Queen song?
I can't really choose one favorite.  But I would say Somebody to love is up there.
Yeah for sure.  It's just musically unreal.
Not only the vocals but the song structure.
No kidding.  Something you don't always get in rock music.
It was maybe one of the most complex songs in the history of popular music.
With all the counter melodies and harmony.
That was Queen though.  They really just brought it to a new level.
I know I should head to Spotify and download some Queen.
Yeah, not a bad idea.
Ok, so I still like it but oddly annoying.  Flash.
I know, it's like that piece of candy that's just ok but you keep eating it anyway because it's better than carrots.
