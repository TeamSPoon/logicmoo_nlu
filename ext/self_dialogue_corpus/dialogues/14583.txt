Have you been watching the NBA Playoffs?
Of course!  I always watch this time of the year.
Which series has been the most interesting to you so far?
Definitely the Spurs and the Rockets.  Competitive series, one of the few we've had this year.
Yes, that is true.  Which team are you rooting for there?
I would say the Rockets.
Why are you rooting for the Rockets?
Well I want to see competitive series.  I feel like if they beat the Spurs and play the Warriors, it will be a better series.
Wow, so you think the Rockets have a better chance of beating the Warriors than the Spurs?
Yes, I think so.
Why do you think that?
Well health is a big reason.  Spurs have some key injuries now.
That is true.  Tony Parker is done for the year.
Yes, and Kawhi Leonard got injured last game.  We don't know how he's going to look the rest of the way.
That is a good point.  Plus the Rockets simply have more firepower.
That is true.  I don't think they will beat the Warriors, but they should have a better chance than the Spurs.
Ultimately it looks like another Warriors and Cavaliers Finals, right?
Oh yea.  Barring some major injury, that's what we will get.
Who do you have in that one?
Warriors in seven games.
