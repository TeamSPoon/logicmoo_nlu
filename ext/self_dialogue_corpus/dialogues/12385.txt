Who is the best Star Wars villain? This includes people that are not siths
Peter Cushing's character in the original
You liked him?
He was very scary
I liked him too. He was the true leader of that movie
I agree
He has a very intense look
Yeah. He is scarier than Darth Sidious
I would not go that far.
The bottom line is he is a great villain.
