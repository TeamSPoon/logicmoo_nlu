Do you know of any good punk bands?
Yes I do. Have you heard of Pennywise?
No I have not. What are they like?
They are big fans of the beach boys. They play punk that has a "surfing" edge to it.
That sounds awesome. They sound kind of familiar.
You might have heard them in some skateboarding videos.
So they are really into action sports?
Yes they are. Fans of those sports usually like their music.
If those daredevils are into it then I think it's worth checking out.
It is. You will definitely get pumped up by their songs.
