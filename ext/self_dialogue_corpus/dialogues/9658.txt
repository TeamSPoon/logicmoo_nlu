Do you remember Vanilla Ice?
He was so popular when I was in middle school!
What ever happened to him?
I know around 2000 he was touring as a hard rock act.  My brother went see him at a local bar.
Seriously, rock?
Yeah, he's not into rap anymore.
Does he still do performances?
I don't know.  I think he had gotten into trouble, but he had straightened up.
So what does he do now?
I think he has some kind of remodeling home show on TV.
