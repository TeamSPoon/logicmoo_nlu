Want to watch a comedy tonight?
Sure. I like the lightness of comedies.
Which ones are your favorite?
Adam Sandler movies are good. Not a fan of Jim Cary.
Nor am I. He's a bit obnoxious.
I thought only I thought that.
Liar, Liar isn't terrible but that's about it.
Yeah, that one is OK.
Have you seen many others?
A few but I don't like them.
