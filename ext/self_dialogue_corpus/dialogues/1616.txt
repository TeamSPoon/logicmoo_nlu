I can't wait for the NFL to start!
Yep. Been too long without football.
The Patriots are going to go back to back!!
Nah, I think the Cowboys will take it all this year. The Cheatriots don't stand a chance.
Yeah, well, the Cowboys let their best corners walk.
No, the Cowboys let veterans walk, but they aren't the best. Everyone is really high on this new group and they look really good.
Yeah, maybe, but there's no pass rusher.
Between Taco Charlton and Charles Tapper, there's plenty of talent there. We'll see what hapoens and how they gel in training camp.
Well, I don't think they're that great. The rest of the NFC East has stepped up.
The rest of the NFC East has miles to go. This offense is potent and with Prescott and Elliott returning to form, they'll win it.
Who do you like in the AFC?
I think it's the Chiefs. They have a complete team, and Andy Reid is a fantastic coach.
Did't they draft a quarterback this year?
Yep. Patrick Mahomes from Texas Tech. I'm excited to see how he does.
He does have a good coach to learn from.
Yeah, and Alex Smith is better than people give him credit for. Mahomes will get his due.
What about the Texans?
The Texans won't go anywhere without a QB. Right now, their best bet is to see who gets cut in training camp....and pray.
Sounds like the Broncos.
Yep. They messed up with Osweiller. No QB. Hey, I have to go. Talk to you later.
