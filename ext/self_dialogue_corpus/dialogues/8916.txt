Hello what are you listening to?
I am listening to Aerosmith.
Oh I love them, are they your favorite Rock band?
I like Aerosmith but I like Bon Jovi better.
Oh I do too! I love "Living on a prayer"
Yea it is my theme song of sorts.
I also like like Bon Jovi's "You give love a bad name"
Yea that one is ok, how about "Always"?
I like that one as well. It reminds me of Aerosmiths "Angel" since it is sappy.
Oh yes Angel by Aerosmith is so sweet! I listen to it when I am feeling bad about my relationship.
