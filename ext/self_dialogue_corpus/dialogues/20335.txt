What are some good movies on Netflix?
Depends on who you are watching it with!
With my kids, I have 5 daughters!
Oh, then you should watch Moana with them!
That's on Netflix already?
Yeah, it just got added in the past day or two
Wow! I've heard so much about it, what do you think of it?
It's one of my favorite Disney movies recently
Is it better than Frozen?
That's hard to say, I really liked both of them?
Which one has better music?
I'd say Moana, it's really upbeat and happy
Are the songs going to get stuck in my kids heads?
Probably, but not as much as Frozen songs did!
That's good, my daughers were dressing like Elsa for months!
Well now they might be dressing like Moana!
That's okay, she seems okay on the movie poster!
I hope my daughters dont sing the music too much!
Maybe you'll be singing too!
We'll get the soundtrack for the whole family!
