I cannot wait for the Atlanta Falcons new season.
Will they still be good?
They will be. Ryan's still a great quarterback, Quinn's a great coach.
How demoralizing was that Super Bowl loss?
It was tough to swallow but it will be better soon.
It's not better now?
No but time will heal it.
As a Seahawks fan I know the pain of a loss to the Patriots.
Why didn't they run the ball with Lynch?
I don't know, they didn't. I wish they would have.
That's a true shame.
I know, right? It is really a shame. It was right there.
What happens if they run the ball?
They probably win the game.
I wish I could take that moment back.
Me too. I want it back.
Everything gets better with time though, right?
Everything in NFL football at least.
The Falcons will do well.
So will the Seahawks.
