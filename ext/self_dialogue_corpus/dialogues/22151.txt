Did you hear of the movie Wadjda?
No, what's it about?
It's about a girl growing up in Saudi Arabia.
Sounds oppressive already.
Yes.  She's an eleven year old girl who wants to buy a bike.
Do they let girls ride bikes there?
No, her mom refuses to get her one.
That stinks.
So she tries to get her money by selling mix tapes, but gets bagged.
Too bad.
Then she hits on the idea of winning a Quran recital competition.
Neat. Does she win?
Yes, she does.
Does she get the bike?
Well, the school doesn't like her idea about buying a bike.
And?
They donate her prize money to Palestinians.
Sounds lousy.
Her mom buys her the bike, so she's happy.
That's good.  At least it's a good ending.
