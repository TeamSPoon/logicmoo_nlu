What is your favorite super hero movie?
My favorite was the Dark Knight
I did rather enjoy that movie it was rather interesting.
I loved the actor who played the joker
he did an amazing job with what he portrayed
He was like the perfect crazy villian
I honestly think he is as good as Jack Nicholson
Honestly i could say something you would not agree with.
What would that be?
Ledger was a much better joker than jack was
No way that is not true as far as actors go Nicholson wins
I mean he is a great actor but their was something missing something not as good
What do you mean something was missing?
He just felt lacking in the role like he was not all there
I felt like he played the role perfect.
He was not as insane enough in how he portrayed him
Are you crazy he did the role perfect justice
I will disagree
maybe you should watch it again.
Well if you want to be the one to invite me to watch then sure i guess.
