I went to see Guardians of the Galaxy 2.
Who did you go see it with?
My wife and I went.
Did you see it in XD?
No, but we did go to the new theater in town that lets you recline.
Was the movie good?
I really liked it.
What was the best part?
I liked the Mary Poppins looking scene.
I had heard all about that scene before i even saw the movie myself.
It was apparently a big deal.
Who's your favorite character?
STARLORD of course!
I figured that.
I've liked the actor since watching him in Parks and Rec.
That's an awesome show.
Can you imagine being the fat guy in a TV show and gettin buff to be in a movie?
Can you imagine how much money he makes?
I bet it's totally worth it.
