Have you heard the new Lana de Rey song, the one with the Weeknd?
I did, it's really pretty. Kinda sad though.
Isn't that kind of Lana's style though, pretty but sad?
It is, but her music is all dreamy and beautiful and it's easy to forget sometimes that they are kind of tragic.
You know this one was inspired by an actress that jumped off the Hollywood sign.
Wow! That's intense.
It is. I think she really turned it around though, I mean Lust for Life has a hopefulness to it that makes it feel more inspiring than the story it's based on.
That's true, I mean it literally says a lust for life keeps us alive.
Also there's a ton of references in that song. The title itself is a nod to Iggy Pop's Lust for Life.
Doesn't she say something at one point about My Boyfriend's Back?
She does! I hadn't even thought about that. There are those little "doo wops" in there too that feel very vintage.
The whole song is like a love letter to this rose-coloured version of Hollywood and music history.
It is. But is that a bad thing?
No, because since it's Lana del Rey, it comes across as more subversive than if it were a more conventional pop star.
That's true. She often explores dark things but with that dreamy pretty quality that makes them seem less scary.
I like that the Weeknd is on this track, his voice really just melts into the song with her voice and it sounds great.
I wasn't sure about him at first, I hadn't really liked Can't Feel My Face.
You didn't? I loved that song, could never stop singing it!
Yeah well, I really like him in this song.
Good, maybe you should listen to his solo stuff again, you might like it.
