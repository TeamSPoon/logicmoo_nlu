Which NFL player really defied expectations last year?
I don't think anyone expected Dak Prescott to do as well as he did
And to lead the Cowboys into the playoffs with a legitimate chance at the Superbowl, too
I do think he had a lot of help from his teammates, but it's still impressive
And if he hadn't done as well as he did, Tony Romo may not have retired
I feel bad that Tony Romo never got the recognition that he deserved
But then again, maybe it's the other players on the team that make both Prescott and Romo look good
I guess it's hard not to do well when you have Jason Witten and Dez Bryant on your team
That makes sense when the team does noticably better when Dez is healthy
But either way, Prescott was set up to be a backup to Tony Romo, not take over the team as a rookie
True, but they didn't have much of a choice when it was between him and Mark Sanchez
Was that who it was? It's so hard to keep track of where Sanchez is these days
He wasn't that bad of a player, but I don't think he'll ever live down the butt fumble
If I were him, I would laugh along with it until it wasn't a joke anymore
And there hasn't really been anything since then to distract from it, despite some bad plays over the years
I remember seeing Desean Jackson try to reverse field and run back a kick or a punt, only to lose a ton of yards
Can you blame someone for trying something that worked so well for him in the past?
Maybe not, but as a player you still have to know when to take chances like that or just cut your losses
It's easier for players to take the 25 yards for a touchback when most don't return it that far
Well that may be but I still don't like that rule change, 20 yards was plenty before
