Can you help me identify the rapper who sings these lyrics? The lyrics are "house real big, car so big, etc."
That's my dude Mannie Fresh man!
I knew the beat sounded familiar. Do you know when that song was released?
The song was released on Mannie's first solo album called The Mind of Mannie Fresh in 2004.
Didn't he perform at Jazzfest 3 years ago with Juvenile?
Yeah he did. Thomas and myself both went and saw the performance. It was great, Mannie is one of the greatest DJ's in the rap game.
Is he still producing music these days?
I know he did some work with Lil Jon and Rick Ross not too long ago but he hasn't put out any solo stuff in a long time.
Pretty sure he still lives in New Orleans, I bet he does shows around the city.
We should try and find out.I would love to see him perform live again. Well worth any amount of money.
