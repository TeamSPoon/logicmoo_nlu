Which one is a better lyricist: Andre 3000 or Big Boi?
If we're talking creativity, Andre. Flow, then Big Boi.
Interesting, why do you think so?
I think Andre had better wordplay and utilized the meaning of his lyrics for good.
Okay, but Big Boi told stories that were compelling. How about this?
While I definitely agree with that, Andre 3000s creativity added additional spark to the stories that he told.
Okay, so on International Player's Anthem, who had the better verse?
Definitely Andre. That intro is iconic.
Okay, I definitely feel that. Don't neglect the depth that Big Boi's verse had.
Of course not, but Andre's is remembered by more fans.
