Do you like baseball?
To be honest, not really. What about you?
It's okay. I used to hate it but it's grown on me in recent years.
Oh? Do you prefer watching pro or college baseball more?
Like with most sports I generally prefer watching college.
Men or women?
Well technically women would be softball, but that's a whole different conversation. Usually men but I'll occasionally check out the women's.
What is your favorite team?
OU Sooners of course! University of Oklahoma all the way!
OSU is better... at least in basketball. So why'd you start getting into baseball?
I used to play as a kid, but one day there was literally nothing on television so I watched a little bit of a game and ended up getting really into it.
Didn't you used to play?
Kinda, but not really seriously. It was more of a forced hobby as a child.
Ah yeah. Same thing happened to me - probably why I hate it to this day.
I can see what. Did you play long?
My parents forced me to do it a couple of summers. I wasn't bad at it by any means but it just didn't click with me/my interests.
Same, but I guess there were a few good memories. Probably why I'm starting to get into it - little bit of nostalgia.
The closest I'll get to it is via the Wii and even then...
You'd rather play tennis than baseball.
Absolutely. It's great you're getting into it again, but I just don't think I'll ever be even a casual fan of baseball.
