I don't get how they are going to make a live action Lion King Movie.
I assume it will be kind of like the Jungle Book.
But there weren't any people in the Lion King so how will any of it be live action?
Most of the Jungle Book was CGI, so I guess all of the movie will be CGI.
It should just be considered an animated movie then.
I do love that they are bringing back James Earl Jones as the voice of Mufasa.
And Donald Glover will be Simba!
I don't think I know who any of the other characters are or if they have even been cast yet.
It should be interesting, hopefully it goes well.
I wonder what they will do with the music in this one. Maybe they will update it a little bit.
