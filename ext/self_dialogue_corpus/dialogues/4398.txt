I loved Shutter Island
It was one of Leo's best roles.
I just think with the plot twist.
I didnt not see the idea of him murdering his family.
Yeah that kind of kept you on edge.
It was a bizarre turn of events.
Thats why I think its one of his better roles.
How often does he do those kinds of movies
Yeah he stays away from the thriller genre.
I agree but he can act the heck out of them
