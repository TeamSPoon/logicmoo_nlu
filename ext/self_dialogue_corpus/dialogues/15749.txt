Is it just me, or has it been a while since Taylor Swift released a new song?
I hadn't really thought about it. She's done a few singles with people but when is the last time she released an album?
I think it was in 2014. That's when 1989 was released, right?
Wow! Was it really that long ago! It feels like that album was just released a few months ago.
Yeah it had so many awesome songs on it. I think Wildest Dreams was my favorite.
Really? I thought that one was good but it wasn't in my top 3.
What's your top three from that album?
Blank Space, Style, and This Love.
I don't remember This Love.
Yeah, it wasn't a very popular one. i don't think it even made the top charts. But it was a really sweet song.
She also did a lot of music videos for that album. She always has great ones.
Did you see Bad Blood? SHe had so many celebrities help with it.
Yeah. Selena Gomez was in it, I love her. Also Gigi Hadid and Zendaya and many more.
It was truly a star-studded music video.
I still like her old songs, too. Especially when she was still in the country genre.
Yeah, her older albums of country music are still gold. There were so many good breakup songs.
Especially Picture to Burn. I still sing that one all the time.
I wonder if she will ever release anything country again.
She might, but probably not as a popular album piece. Maybe as a special or single or something.
Yeah, that's true. As long as she keeps making albums, I'll be happy.
