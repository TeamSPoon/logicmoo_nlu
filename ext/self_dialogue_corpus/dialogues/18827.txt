Have you heard Despacito
What is that
The Spanish language song with Justin Beiber
Oh yeah, with Daddy Yankee
I love it, it makes me want to dance
I have heard it a few times on the radio, can you understand it
No but I try to sing along
I can see you doing it, I like the new neil horan song
Which one is that
Slow hands, it is kinda mellow but I nice change
It sounds like something you would like, I need a faster beat
It helps me relax after a day at work
I need a faster song to relax
That doesn't make any sense
Music does not need to make sense, it needs to make you feel
That is some non-sense but I kinda understand it
Have you been listening to Taylor Swift again
Not really, why
Her songs are on spotify again
Really, I will check it out again
