Okay, so you see how the deflated football incidents with the Pats, right?
Yeah.
What if someone paid the Pats to do that?
NO WAY. They debunked that stuff a long time ago.
Okay, sure. But what if there was someone behind it, and not the Patriots?
You're overthinking this a little bi.
I mean, come on! Sure, the Patriots wanna win the Super Bowl badly!
Yeah, but that doesn't justify how someone else could be behind the deflated balls.
Think about it, though!
Ugggh, I'm not so sure, man.
Well, who else could have done it, then?
Someone in the football team, obviously not among the players!
NOOO, dumb-nut! I meant the mastermind behind it all!
Uhhhh, I don't think there's anyone behind the incident.
Dude, why you gotta be so stubborn sometimes?
Well, that's me, man.
Whatever, so who do you think is an alright thrower?
Kaepernick's pretty good.
Who else?
Wanna watch Aaron Rodgers throw at practice?
