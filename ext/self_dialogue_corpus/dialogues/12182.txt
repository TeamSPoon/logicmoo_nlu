Do you like the Star Wars prequel movies?
Yes, for the most part.
Which one was your favorite?
I liked The Phantom Menace, primarily for the epic duel between Darth Maul and Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan.
That was pretty cool. Probably the best duel of any of the movies.
I agree. Which prequel did you like the best?
I liked Revenge of the Sith. It upped the visual effects ante, and we got to see two epic duels between Sidious/Yoda and Vader/Kenobi.
That was my second favorite. Those duels I would place in the top 10.
Did you like the way they showed Vader's transformation to the dark side?
No, I thought that it was rushed, and the actor didn't do a great job with the material.
