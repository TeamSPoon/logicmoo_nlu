So I have to tell you about this new album I just heard.
Oh yeah? What new crazy album are you listening to now?
I'll give you the genre and you can guess. It's Hip Hop. I will give you more clues if you can't guess right away.
Only the genre, really? All right. So knowing you, and what you've been up to lately I would say Kendrick Lamar's new album.
Dang, you're good. You know I really like his last album, so I can see why you picked that.
Yeah. His beats are pretty tight. My wife, surprisingly, thinks he's a genius. I don't listen to a whole lot of hip hop so I'm not a good one to ask opinions about it.
Well let me fill you in on a couple of things about it. First off, all the song titles are one word. It reminds me of the movie Seven.
Like deadly sins? Or something else?
He's got song titles like Love, Loyalty, Fear, etc. It's pretty freaking genius if you ask me.
So my wife was right, huh? Does it have any comedy in it?
Well, sort of, if you consider dark humor to be comedy.
Okay. Yeah, that's my favorite kind. You've got me kind of curious now.
Trust me, even if you don't like rap, I bet you could appreciate the beats and the content of his lyrics. He talks some about the state of things currently in this social and political climate right now.
Sound interesting so far. As long as they don't all sound somewhat the same-- because I hate that.
No, no. Absolutely not. It's actually a little too diverse in my opinion, but does a good job in at least keeping to a theme.
Well that's good. Does he have any guest singers that add some hot stuff to the tracks?
Yeah. I'm trying to remember exactly who, but-- Oh, I got it now. There's U2, Big Boi, Rhianna...
Nice. You're right, that is pretty diverse.
He is definitely the most up and coming hip hop artist within that last few years. He talks a real game and keeps it 100% honest.
I like that. I will definitely check it out now. Burn me a copy, or just FTP it to me tomorrow, all right?
