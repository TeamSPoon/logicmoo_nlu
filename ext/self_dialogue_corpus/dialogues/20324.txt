I shouldn't say this but I remember when Star Wars first came out.
You mean back in 1978?
Yeah, I was 8 years old. And I loved it .
Really?
I remember seeing that movie 7 or 8 times. It was the first movie I could to without an adult.
That's crazy. Your parents let you go by yourself?
Well I went with my cousins. There was 4 of us we all loved R2D2. We collected the cars, had digital watches, etc.
Sounds like you were all decked out. I was about your age too but I don't remember being that big of fan.
It was amazing. The movie was just magical. We had never seen anything like that before!
I remember thinking C3PO was annoying but I couldn't believe some one was skinny enough to fit in that suit.
Yeah, I remember that too. My brother had a X-wing fighter. He was a huge Jedi fan.
Did he have one of those that shot stuff.
Yeah, one of the ones that recalled.
Too bad. Bet that thing is worth a fortune now.
You know it. The marketing back then to go with movies is nothing like now. There was something kind of innocent about that time period.
Yeah, the first one was the best. I followed the other movies but they seemed to lose something for me.
The Empire Strikes back was good too. A lot of people consider that to be the pinnacle.
Yeah, I can't say I'm one of them.
I was glad to see they brought back Mark Hamil for these new ones.
yeah, they did do a  good job blending the old and the new. I remember thinking Han Solo was old then!
