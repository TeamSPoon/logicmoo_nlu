Boston's great.
They're okay.
I mean.
They're not great by any means.
They are.
I don't think that's the case.
I promise.
Come on.
They 're really, really active.
They're not so good.
They're like always clever.
They never do anything new.
They love to do new stuff.
Their midgame is still decades old.
Yeah, and?
It's boring.
It's perfect. Timeless.
It's dead. Rotting.
You hate good hockey.
I love it. That's why I hate Boston.
