I am trying to watch every movie that won an Oscar for Best Picture.
Did you see Moonlight? It won Best Picture this year.
No, right now I am watching Oscar winners from the 1980's, like Platoon.
Platoon was moving, but I personally do not like war films.
Well, my favorite 1980's Best Picture winner is Amadeus.
Why? I thought the film was way too long.
I just enjoyed the contrast between Tom Hulce and F Murray Abraham as Mozart and Salieri.
I thought the 1970's was better decade for Best Picture films.
What was your favorite one of the 1970's?  I liked Annie Hall.
I am surprised you did not say The Godfather.
The Godfather and its sequels are great movies.  But I prefer romantic comedies.
I like them too, although I am not a Woody Allen fan.
Well, Diane Keaton appears in both Annie Hall and The Godfather.
She is a versatile actress.
I think Meryl Streep is my favorite actress.
Well, she has won the Best Actress Oscar twice and been nominated for many more.
I liked her performance best in Out of Africa.
My favorite Meryl Streep movie is Julie & Julia.
I was surprised Sandra Bullock won the Best Actress Oscar that year.
Sandra Bullock had a better performance in Crash.
