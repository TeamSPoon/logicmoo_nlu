Who do you think is the most underrated head coach in the NFL?
As far as current coaches go, I think Marvin Lewis deserves credit for taking the Bengals to the playoffs several years running
Yeah but they haven't won a playoff game in something like two decades
That may be, but plenty of teams people consider better than the Bengals consistently miss the playoffs
John Fox led the Broncos to the playoffs several times only to get fired a few years back
That's true, and I sometimes wonder if the Bengals will do the same thing to Marvin Lewis some day
It worked for the Broncos when they brought in Gary Kubiak, so you may be right
I still think Marvin Lewis is a good coach and would land on his feet somewhere else if that happened
Absolutely, since Kubiak coached an unsuccessful Houston Texans a couple of years before going to the Broncos
Can we really attribute their success to the coach, or is it more the players?
That's hard to tell, and I think you can really only give credit to clearly exemplary coaches like Bill Belichick
Belichick will probably go down as the best coach in NFL history, so it's hard to make comparisons
Who else do you think deserves recognition as a head coach?
Bruce Arians' Cardinals have been struggling the last couple of years, but they came awfully close to their goal a couple seasons back
Arians won coach of the year recently, too, didn't he?
Yes he did, and for someone who was virtually run out of Pittsburgh I'd say that's quite the accomplishment
But does that offer him job security moving forward?
It will for a while, but if the Cardinals don't make it to the Superbowl in the next couple of seasons, he may end up on the chopping block
I guess that doesn't bode well for Marvin Lewis if his Bengals can't even win a playoff game
Probably not, but the NFL community works in mysterious ways, so I guess we'll see
