Did you notice that Taylor Swift is on Spotify now?
Oh really? That's cool I guess.
What, you don't like her?
I mean she's fine, but never really my favorite.
I get that, she's more of a middle school thing.
Yeah. I did like some of her old stuff, even though I'm not a huge fan of country.
Me too! Teardrops on My Guitar was the first thing I ever looked up on Google.
What? That's so funny.
I liked Our Song, too.
Yeah, people used to sing that in music class.
True, it's definitely that kind of song.
Catchy, for sure.
Has she even released anything lately?
Honestly, I don't think so.
Yeah, I'm pretty sure her last album was a few years ago.
I remember that. It was my junior year of high school and everyone was obsessed.
There were some good tracks. I liked Wonderland.
Yeah, it was fine.
Well, you should give her a listen on Spotify.
Alright, maybe I will.
