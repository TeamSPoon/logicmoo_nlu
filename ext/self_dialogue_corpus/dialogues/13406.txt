What are your thoughts on Star Wars rogue 1?
I liked it a lot! I was surprised at how much I actually like do it.
I know what you mean, the characters were spot on.
Agreed, and it’s amazing how well the new Star Wars movies are true to the originals.
That’s why I was so happy when Disney bought the franchise, I was also a little concerned but now I see that they are doing incredible things.
Yes and as a spin off doing well, I bet they’ll make more spin offs!
I heard they are working on another spin off, a Han Solo movie.
Yes there are, and I’m already excited to see what they will do with the Han Solo character.
I feel that it’s almost guaranteed to be good, if what they have done so far is anything to go by.
And don’t forget we’ve got the last Jedi to look forward to also.
