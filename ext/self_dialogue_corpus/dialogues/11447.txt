I'm not a huge fan of the beatles generally
oh wow. that is blasphemy
I do really like one of their songs though
oh yeah, which one?
revolution
that's an awesome song, classic
isn't all of there stuff considered classic
pretty much
once i hear revolution, I can't get it out of my head though
it happens
