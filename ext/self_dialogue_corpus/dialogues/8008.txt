What's your favorite pop song on the radio right now?
Probably "Stay" by Alessia Cara and Zedd.
I love that one!
I love how she sings it. She's the perfect voice for it.
Others could make it work.
Yeah, but her specific delivery is unique.
Sure. You didn't ask me mine.
What's your favorite?
Lady Gaga's The Cure.
Horrible lyrics, sorry. I'll cure you with my love? How lame.
