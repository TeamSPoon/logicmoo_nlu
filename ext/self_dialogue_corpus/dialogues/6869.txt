Did you see Swiss Family Robinson?
That movie was epic
The people crash landed on the island, but seemed to make the best of it
I would have built another boat
Maybe that just wasn't in the movie
I guess that would have taken a while. Although they seemed to spend a lot of time on their tree house
I like how they thought about the kids. They would want to start a family of their own after a while
Wasn't the youngest kid funny
It was funny how he trapped the elephant
They had so many animals
