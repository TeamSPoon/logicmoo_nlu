Mind if I put on a record?
Sure, whats on the menu?
I've got a great collection of old jazz albums.
Anything by coltrane?
Probably not, I mean, I got most of these from a thrift shop.
I'll take anything, I'm not picky.
Not picky eh? What do you normally listen to?
My tastes are pretty eclectic.
Go on, try me.
Well, some days I listen to dubstep, sometimes its country twang.
A real spectral traveler eh?
Yeah, I can appreciate most anything with a beat.
In that case, I'll opt for something free form.
I can dig it!
Let's get this party started.
Wow, this is some good stuff!
I guess buying that record player finally is paying off.
What, you don't use it often?
This is literally the first time.
Heck yeah! Turn it up then!
