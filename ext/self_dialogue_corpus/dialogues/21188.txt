Taratino is a hack.
He's like quintessential schlock boy tastes.
He sounds like someone with serious opinions about kitsch.
It's so self aware.
It's damningly self aware.
I can't stand the mood of his stuff.
God, I know.
He's like low brow Harmony Koraine.
Without the experimentation.
Boring Harmony Koraine.
Dumb Harmony Koraine.
Dysharmony Koraine.
He wants to do the same things Harmony is doing.
Yeah.
But not aesthetically, like.
Yeah.
That's why he uses so many low brow cultural signifiers and shoots with what cameras he does and with what stories he does.
He stinks.
He's lame.
Self consciously low brow is the most condescending thing.
