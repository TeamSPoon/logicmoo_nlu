Have you ever cried while watching a movie?
I'm embarrassed to say I have.
Why do you feel embarrassed?
Because it's just a movie.
Even a movie can evoke real life emotions.
That's really true.
Which movies have made you cry?
I was devastated with Old Yeller.. I really love animals and hate when they die.
That was a really sad moment in the movie. I shed some tears when I watched Marley and Me.
Both Dolphin Tales movies got to me.
I haven't seen any of them.
Trust me. They were emotional.
I know any movie based on a real life event becomes so much more real to me.
Even movies not based on real life can get to me when they are done properly.
I'm also a big lover of dogs, so dog deaths get to me.
Oh I hated it when Hooch died in Turner & Hooch.
That was sad.
Corny as this is, I even cried when the beast died in Beauty and the Beast.
So did I.
Now I feel better.
