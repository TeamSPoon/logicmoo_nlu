Schonberg devised a method for composing called 12 tone method.
What's that?
It's a school of thought from the 20s led by Schonberg. Basically they used all 12 notes on the chromatic scale without any preference of one single note
That's so bizarre.
And every difficult to do. It's easy just playing all 12 notes. But which one do you play to make it musical?
That's what I'm asking you! How do they do it?
if all the notes in the chromatic scales are played equally, you can ensure not being in any key. Thus you're officially atonal
That seems like cheating.
Not really, because it is really difficult to make music doing it
it can't just all be random trial and error.
They have certain ways to arrange the notes, like using serialism
What's that?
Serialism is where you do things in series or serially. Liek arrange the note lengths from the whole note as 1, then a half note as 2, a dotted quyarter as 3 and move down in lengths like that
Can the note lengths go up?
Of course as long as it's done serially.
So as long as some things are in a series it's serialism
Um yes. The way schonberg did it is to used a thematic element that recurrs.
Why repeat?
Even the atonal music has structure. Music is a rule. A symmetry,, howver disorganized the individual parts are, is still symmetric
And the atonal music has a symmetry?
