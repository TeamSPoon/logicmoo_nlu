Which artist which you say made better pop music? Christina Aguilera or Britney Spears?
I would probably say Christina. Her songs have more depth and emotion.
That is true but Britney has some catchy tunes.
I know. I have danced to many of them with you on the dance floor.
Speaking of dancing, Christina has had some dance music herself.
Has she? I have never heard of the songs.
Yes she has. I don't think they did very well on the pop music charts.
Well, both artists are still relevant.
That is true. Christina is on the Voice and Britney has residency in Las Vegas.
I bet it would be fun to see Britney in Vegas!
