What Adam Sandler movie do you think was his best?
Tough to say, maybe Big Daddy?
I would go with Happy Gilmore
Between Billy Madison and the Wedding Singer it was tough.
He wrote some of these movies too.
I agree he was talented.
You say was?
Yeah I think something happened
What do you suppose?
Like most comedians, they just grow stale.
It is a tough genre to exceed in for a while.
Unless you do standup and stick to that, yes.
I agree on that issue, I think he had the talent.
Acting in comedies grows old as well.
I dont know they are some good movies.
I love comedies its probably my favorite genre.
It is a great genre but nothing that wins awards.
I think they act for the money anyway
Thats Hollywood for you.
Its a shame, they could do so much more within the genre.
