Have you seen any of the Hunger Games movies?
Yes, I think I have saw all of them.
The first one I about went to sleep when it first started but when they we on the train on the way to the city I got into it.
I thought for sure Katniss would be one of the first ones killed.
Peeta too, I thought there is no way this kid is going to survive. He couldn't even stand up to his mother.
I thought Josh Hutcherson did a good job winning the audience over playing Peeta.
Yeah, but I still would have waited for Gail, he was worth living for.
He was so good looking, he was played by Liam Hemsworth.
Woody Harrison was amazing playing Haymitch. I thought they were calling him Amish all the way through the first movie.
I thought he would turn out to be a bad guy in the end because he was such a jerk in the beginning.
I thought Effie was a cold hearted woman.
I know she was so odd looking but did you know in real life she is beautiful.
I saw her in an interview but I don't remember who played her.
Elizabeth Banks she is so sweet. It was a good role for her.
Yeah, she was a stand out character and ended up being a nice person in the movie.
Did you cry when the little girl named Rue died.
Like a baby it was so sad.
I love the ending of the first one, where they had the poison berries.
They played the game very well.
Thank goodness we don't really have that kind of lottery.
