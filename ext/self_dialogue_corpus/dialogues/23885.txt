What are your favorite Batman movie?
I would have to say the Dark Knight.
What great choice. Did that come out in 2008?
Yes it did actually. It is the one with Heath ledger.
Doesn't he play the Joker and that?
Yes, I believe that is the best Joker of any Batman movie.
I don't think anybody could disagree with you.
Everything about the movie to me is outstanding.
What did you think about Batman's performance in that movie?
I really like Christian Bale as Batman.
Did you like him in the third installment of the franchise?
I still liked him but not as much as in the Dark Night.
I kind of thought that movie was long.
It was pretty long, but there was a lot of story to expand on.
I would have to agree with you. I thought it was done extremely well.
I do have to admit the first Batman movie wasn't very good in this franchise.
Yeah, I think that was the weakest movie of the three.
So do you think the Dark Knight is the best Batman movie too?
Yes in fact I would agree with you.
Two great minds always think alike.
