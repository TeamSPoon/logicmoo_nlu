Hey, you have your PhD in music, right?
Music theory, to be specific, but yes.
My daughter is going to apply for music programs next year. Any recommendations?
Sure, what program?
Music.
No, like...performance, theater, education, theory, business,...
I think she wants to direct bands.
Right now the best thing you can do is to get an education degree with a strong theory background.
Why is that?
Well, she'll either be super busy teaching band at a bunch of schools, or not busy at all. In that case, she should be able to teach other classes.
Why theory?
Well, history is easy to teach. Theory is more specialized.
Cann't anyone with a degree teach music theory?
NO! Most people can't.
Why is that?
Well lots of schools hire professors to teach some lessons and a class or two. They're usually bad at theory.
She wants to avoid a big city.
Lots of small schools in small towns have great programs, don't worry.
Good, plus they're too expensive.
Crazy expensive.
