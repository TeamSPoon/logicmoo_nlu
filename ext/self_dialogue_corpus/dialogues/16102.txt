How about in memory of Prince we listen to some of his music?
Yeah, that sounds like a good idea. It is so horrible he is gone.
I know.It definitely wasn't his time.
I'd really like to hear Purple Rain.
Alright. That is a really good song.
Did you know he died from an Opioid overdose?
Yep. And he was only 57 years old.
Did you find Purple Rain yet?
I have it here. Little Red Corvette is a good song too.
Yeah it is! We will have to hear that one too!
No problem. I'm a huge Prince fan and I have most of his music.
Evens newer songs?
Some, but not Deliverance
That stinks. I wanted to hear that one.
It was released on June 2nd but when I got there it was sold out.
I could understand why!
Yeah. I think it was a celebration release since it had been a year since his death.
He should be celebrated.He was loved when I was younger and he continues to get new fans.
I know I'll never forget him.
He is legendary!
