What do you think Gonk is going to do this year.
I hope he stays healthy.
Watch out if he does he is a heck of a offensive weapon.
He adds an extra dimension to a already great offense.
When he is the second tight end watch out.
Yeah the Patriots have so much to choose from they are hard to defend.
Did you know he's the highest paid tight end in the league.
Yeah, Brady takes pay cuts to keep guys like him around to make the team stronger.
Smart move with him in there it keeps Tom healthy and he doesn't get hit as much
That's another secret to his longevity.
I think Gronk has a couple more seasons in him if he stays healthy.
That's the tough part when you are a huge target and your job is to run over people if you have to.
I love to see him do it and then slam the ball though.
Have you heard the controversy about his logo though.
No what's that about.
Some basketball player is complaining that he stole his logo
You mean the silhouette of him slamming the ball down on apparel and stuff
It was pretty similar though.
And he's also said Goodel wouldn't be welcome in Foxborough too.
Can't blame him for that.  I hate Goodell too.  Who doesn't
