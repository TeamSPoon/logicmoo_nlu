I saw the silliest movie ever the other day.
I see silly movies all the time.  Help me out here.
I'll give you a hint: it involves killer cell phones.
Killer cell phones?  What are you talking about?
I'm talking about the movie Cell.
Never heard of it.  Explain more.
It was actually based off of a Stephen King novel.
Okay, I'm actually interested.  King has some pedigree.
Here's the thing: they butchered his novel and made this super horrible movie.
Who's in it?
John Cusack, Samuel L. Jackson?
Really?  They signed up for that garbage?
Guess they needed their paychecks.  After all, this is killer cell phones they're after.
Explain the plot more to me.  I just don't understand.
So cell phones end up sending out this tone that drives people crazy and leads them to kill one another.
Sounds completely ridiculous.
It certainly is.  The movie is even worse in how they try and fight it and restore humanity.
I just can't wrap my head around why any serious actor would think this was a good idea.
Sometimes you gotta do things to keep in the spotlight, I guess.
Not if that spotlight highlights you're poor choice in movie roles.
