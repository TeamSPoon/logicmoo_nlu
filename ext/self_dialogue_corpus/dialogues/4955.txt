Do you think the steroid guys should get in the Hall of Fame?
yes with an asterisk,
Whys that?
Its important to note that these guys had talent they just gave into the evils of the game.
Barry Bonds could have done it without them.
Absolutely and he was doing great without them.
He just became the goat as far as homers by doing them
Yeah and that needs to be noted
What about McGwire.
I think he could have also done it without needing the drugs.
Yeah its a shame we never got to see how these guys could have been without them
To be honest I think baseball kind of needs them
For the scoring?
Yeah its just more exciting when teams were hitting the ball
Now they seem to be pitching experts
I mean you have guys with sub 2 ERAs that lead the league each year.
I think its cyclical and itll return to hitting soon enough
I dont think so.
Guys will find a new steroid that is not detectable
i doubt a comissioner will sit around and let it happen
