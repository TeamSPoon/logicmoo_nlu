Did you hear they're making a Super Troopers 2?
I've been hearing that for a long time actually.
They have finally started filming now.
Awesome! Is everyone coming back?
I believe all the main characters are, yes.
Oh I can't wait. That's one of my favorite movies.
Me too! I quote it almost every day.
Haha same here. There are so many memorable quotes.
I like how when they made Beerfest, they all had completely different characters.
Yeah it really showed their diversity in acting.
Did you know they make each other audition for each part even though they are the writers?
No, I didn't!
I heard them on interview talking about it.
That's so cool. I can't imagine anyone else playing Farva.
No way! Heffernan was born to play that role!
I wonder what the new Super Troopers will be like.
I can't imagine it being anything less than stellar.
And what about Weedfest? Are they still making that?
They said yes, but they wanted to get Super Troopers 2 made first.
Great! I'm looking forward to both of them.
