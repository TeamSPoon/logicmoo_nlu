Do like the music videos from lady gaga?
Absolutely, they are some of the most unique ones out there.
I think so too, she is always ahead of the other artists.
I love her sense of style too.
She always seems to be pushing the bounds of fashion.
She is definitely a true trend setter, not a follower.
And she is a great musician on top of all of that.
Definitely, songs like alejandro and just dance are some of my favorites by any artist.
Those are great, I really like paparrazi as well.
There are so many that its hard to remember all of them.
