Do you like The Beatles?
Do you like Water?
I see your point.
I do not want to be friends with someone who doesn't like The Beatles!
I know I'm not sure what explanation you could give for disliking them.
There are a lot of reasons to not like Yoko Ono however.
I know she completely separated Lennon from his bandmates!
How could she want to stop such beautiful music from being made?
I'm not sure why she didn't encourage the band to stay together.
It is sad but nothing good lasts forever.
Exactly at least we can always listen to their music when they were together.
A lot of their solo music is great too but none of it compares to the music they wrote together.
What is your favorite song by The Beatles?
You've asked a couple tough questions today. It is hard to choose a favorite.
I know what you mean. Let It Be is one of my favorites by them.
I love that one too. It is such a deep song.
Exactly that is why I love it.
They can write happy and sad songs and they are all terrific.
You're right Twist and Shout is another great one.
Now I want to listen to The Beatles now!
