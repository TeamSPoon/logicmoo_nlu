Have you heard of the band Tancred?
I haven't, actually. Who are they?
They're sort of like an indie rock type band.
Cool. What type of indie-rock music do they make? Do you think I'd like them?
Yeah, I think you would. Some of the music is really 90's girl-punk sounding. I love it.
Awesome! Sounds like something I'd like, definitely!
Yeah. Actually, the band is technically just one girl.
Anyone I'd know from another band or something.
Maybe! Tancred is technically a "solo project", I guess, by Jess Abbott from the band Now, Now.
Oh yeah, I know them! They're the band that toured with Paramore a while back, right?
Yeah, that's them! Actually, I think some of the songs on Tancred's new album sound a little bit like Paramore.
I still really love Paramore, so that sounds awesome.
You should definitely check out their new album.
I will. What's it called?
It's called Out of the Garden.
Cool. What song do you suggest I look up first?
My favorite song, by far, is Bed Case.
Awesome. Looking that one up on Spotify right now. How'd you hear about Tancred?
I heard the song Bed Case, actually, on the NPR podcast All Songs Considered.
I should keep up with newer music more by listening to podcasts like that too. Just started listening to the song. I love it!
