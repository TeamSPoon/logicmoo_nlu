I love the class I'm taking right now for my college's intersession program. It's all about the 1960's.
That sounds really interesting. What topics have you covered so far?
We're two classes in. So far we've been focusing on the late 1950's.
Why's that?
To see what was the lead up to some of the events in the 1960's. I had a great discussion with my professor after class today.
What did the two of you talk about?
We talked about our favorite musicians in the 1960's.
That was a great decade for music. Who were your favorites?
Mine are Jefferson Airplane, the Byrds, Janis Joplin, the Animals, and Bob Dylan. My professor's favorites are, the Beatles, the Beach Boys, the Moody Blues, and Simon and Garfunkel.
I like most of the those bands. I haven't listened much to Jefferson Airplane, but I really like their song, "Somebody to Love".
Their album, "Surrealistic Pillow", is really good. What are your favorite musicians form that time?
Leonard Cohen, the Trashman, Bob Dylan, the Beatles, and Janis Joplin.
Which of Joplin's songs is your favorite? I really like, "Me and Bobby McGee", and "Piece of my Heart".
"Piece of my Heart", is my favorite song by her. Have you heard her song, "Bye, Bye Baby"?
I have. I love the musical beat that the song has.
Me too. It really fits with and completes the lyrics.
Can you recommend some of Leonard Cohen's songs for me to listen to? I only know his song, "Hallelujah".
Sure, I really like his songs, "Suzanne", "The Stranger Song", "Sisters of Mercy", and "Hey, That's No Way to Say Good-bye." He's a great musician so don't be afraid to listen to his other songs.
Okay, thank you for the recommendations. I have lots of new music to listen to.
You're welcome. Let me know if you want to talk more about music later.
