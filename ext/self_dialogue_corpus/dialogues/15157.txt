Do you remember Woodstock?
I sure do. I wanted to go.
I did too but I was sixteen and my mother would not let me.
There sure were some amazing bands there.
Yes, Janis Joplin, Jimi Hendrix, and more.
Jefferson Airplane was there and so was Country Joe and the Fish.
I remember the Fish Cheer.
Me too, that was classic.
I had the album.
So did I and would listen to it over and over again.
Crosby Stills Nash and Young did Wooden Ships, great song!
Yea, that was a good song. A lot of up and coming musicians came out of Woodstock.
They sure did. Remember Joe Cocker?
Yes I do
He passed away not too long ago.
He sang A Little Help from my Friends.
That was a good song.
Boy I wish I could go back in time.
Me too, I would love to go to that concert.
Yea, those were the days of some great music.
