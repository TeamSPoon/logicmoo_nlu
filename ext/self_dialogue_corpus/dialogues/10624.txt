Do you like the Fast and Furious franchise?
I only saw Tokyo Drift
Oh that is a great movie
Yeah, I thought Han was great.
He is some of the others too
Which ones?
Los Bondoleros, Fast and Furious, Fast Five, and Fast and Furious 6
I'll have to see if I can find them.
You should, and we could watch them together
That would be fun
