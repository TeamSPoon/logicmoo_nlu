Would you be interested in a spinoff series about Yodas life?
Oh my god yes, that would be the most amazing thing ever.
I feel like it would be a lot better than the new star wars movies they keep making.
Yeah, I don't like the new actors they keep getting. It would be nice to see more of Yoda.
I can only imagine how much of his life we don't know about, considering he is the oldest jedi in the series.
I really want to know where he came from, because there doesn't seem to be any other things in the movie that are the same species as him.
Well, he is a really unique character that's for sure. Most other jedi are human or similar to a human.
Yeah, I think its awesome how hes just a lil tiny guy, but he can still fight like a beast in Attack of the Clones.
If they keep making more and more star wars movies, I'm sure they will make some about Yoda.
If they didn't, it would be a bad mistake. People love Yoda.
