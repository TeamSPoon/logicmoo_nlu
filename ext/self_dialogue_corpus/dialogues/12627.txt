Did you like the music from The Force Awakens?
Yes but overall is wasn't quite as memorable as the rest of the movies. It's still very good though.
What was the highlight of Episode Seven's music to you?
Rey's Theme is far and away the best of the Force Awakens score. It's beautiful and fits the movie so well.
Yeah was really good. When her character is introduce in the deserts of Jakku, the music really takes you to that place.
John Williams just an amazing composer. So many beloved movie scores from him.
The Imperial March was so amazing, it's become part of the culture and just a movie score.
Exactly, don't forget the main Star Wars theme as well. I can't imagine Star Wars without it.
He was just as important as George Lucas in bringing the Star Wars universe to the world.
Definitely. I credit both of them with creating Star Wars.
