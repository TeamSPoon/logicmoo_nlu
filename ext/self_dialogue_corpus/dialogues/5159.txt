Am I the only one that didn't like Monsters Inc?
I'm sure there are others.
I just thought the movie had a good concept, but got old quick.
I don't think it got old, but preferred the kid not go into the monster world.
The plot was just bare.  Trying to make kids feel fear, I get it.
It was interesting how they built an economy around it.
I just don't think destroying a door would somehow prevent you from going back.
It is a kids movie, you know.
Still, I would have expected better.
Be sure to write Pixar and let them know.
