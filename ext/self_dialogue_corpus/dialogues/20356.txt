Have you ever seen Shutter Island?
I am sure I have but it has been a while.
It is one of my favorite thriller movies.
Who acts in it?
Leonardo DiCaprio, Mark Ruffalo, Ben Kingsley, and Michelle Williams plays in this cast.
Who is the director of it?
Martin Scorsese directs it.
And when was it released?
I think it was 2010 for the original release date.
I think I remember that one, it is about two detectives that check out an asylum, and find more than they want to.
Yes, it is a devious movie, with a twist ending.
I didn't like it when one of the detectives in the end realized he wasn't going to get any help.
Yes the end was sad to me as well, it took a minute to realize what was reality and what was not.
The crimes committed by the doctors I think was the worst part of the entire movie.
Kinglsey did a great job in that one.
I think he has been up for more than one Oscar in his career.
It is a pleasure to watch him, along with DiCaprio.
Mark Ruffalo usually plays the good guy, but not this one.
That was part of the sad ending, leaving his partner in the end.
It's a great thriller.
