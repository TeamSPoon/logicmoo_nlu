Have you seen the latest Guardians of the Galaxy movie?
No, have you?
yes, it was good
good to know. I liked the first one.
Yes, this one was just as good. Good comedy and action put together
Super hero movies continue to churn out
Yeah, Disney really took it to another level
Disney? I thought we were talking about Marvel
Disney bought Marvel awhile back
Oh really? I did not know that
That's one of the reasons why there are so many super hero movies now
Ah okay. So Disney has the finances to keep making these movies
Yes, exactly. And they still make a lot of money
That they do, but what about DC?
I'm not sure about DC and who actually owns them now.
The recent DC movies aren't that good.
Yes, I'd agree. Superman v Batman was pretty bad
Yeah, that was bad.
I liked the Batman revival ones though.
Yes, Christian Bale was very good as Batman.
