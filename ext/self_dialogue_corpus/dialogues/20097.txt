Do you want to rent a movie tonight?
Sure what type, a comedy or maybe an action film?
Well, I was actually thinking about watching a horror movie, perhaps a classic.
A classic horror movie huh? Which one?
Well, what about Nightmare on Elm Street or Friday the 13th?
I'm not a big horror movie buff. I actually haven't seen either.
The bad guy in Nightmare on Elm Street is Freddy Krueger.
Oh right, that was directed by Wes Craven right?
Yes, he's a great horror film director.
That is the movie where Freddy Krueger haunts dreams right?
Yes, he haunts the dreams of teenagers. It's terrifying.
That sounds a little too scary for me. What about a comedy instead?
Ok, what is your favorite comedy movie?
I love comedies so I have a bunch. What About Bob is one of the best comedies of all time!
I agree. Bill Murray was hilarious in that movie.
I think it was one of his best roles.  I also like some newer comedies. We could see the movie, Central Intelligence.
Is Kevin Hart in that movie?
Yes, and the movie is so funny. It's also fast paced so you won't get bored.
Kevin Hart is a good actor. Let's get a comedy so we can laugh.
Ok, I'll rent Central Intelligence tonight then.
