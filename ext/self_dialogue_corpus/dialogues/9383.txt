So when did you stop listening to rap music?
About the time Bobby Brown was singing his tender Roni.
Oh man! That was... What? The Eighties?
There are a few rap and hip-hop songs I like. Most of them are older though.
Like what?
Well, I really liked Bobby Brown's early stuff. I like Gangsta's paradise.
Do you even know who sung that?
No idea. I like Iced Tea. He's good in that NCIS show.
So you like him as an actor. Not a singer.
Is Rap musicians even considered singers?
