Okay, here's one thing that bugs me about the Harry Potter movies compared to the books...
What's that?
There's several that happen in the films that, unless you've read the books, just do not make ANY sense.
What's a good example?
Okay, in Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix they all form this secret group called Dumbledore's Army and Hermione has the kids sign their names to a sheet of parchment.  Now, in the book she does this because she's put a curse on the paper.
A curse?
Yeah, something, anyone who tells anybody about the club will burst out in painful sore and whatnot, which is exactly what happens.  but in the movie it makes NO sense for her to do this.
Yeah, right, it just gives the bad guys a convenient list of everyone's who's involved in the group.
Exactly!  So there was no reason about all her for to do that. Plus, they changed who had told about the club (and why) so the whole thing is moot anyhow.
Yeah, they had it be Chang in the film and they had drugged her with that truth potion.
