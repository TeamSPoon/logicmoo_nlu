What are some rock bands you don't really like?
I never got into Van Halen.  I mean, sure they've got some good songs, but I wasn't that into them.
How about Aerosmith?
Dude, the first cd I ever got was Get a Grip.
I really liked a lot of their 80s and early 90s stuff, like Cryin, and Amazing.
So, any video they released with Alicia Silverstone?
I assure you, it's a coincidence.  I thought Nine Lives was an underrated album, too.
Yeah, I liked Hole in my Soul.
Favorite Aerosmith song?
I got a couple:  Dream On, their cover of Come Together, Deuces are Wild, and Jaded.
