I like the Dallas Cowboys.
When they were big they had their own board game.
They are a professional American football team.
Yes, based in Dallas-Ft. Worth.
They compete in the NFL.
I think in the National Football Conference.
Yes, in the East Division.
They joined the NFL as an expansion team in 1960.
They have the record of the most consecutive sell outs.
Yes, 190 consecutive sold out regular and post season games home and away began in 2002.
They have been to the Super Bowl 8 times.
They won 5 Super Bowls.
They had 20 consecutive winning seasons when they missed the play offs twice.
In 2015 they were valued at $4 billion.
Forbes figured that out.
That would make them the most valuable sports team in the world.
They need to win another Super Bowl.
Its about time.
Their revenue in 2014 was $620 million.
That's a lot of money.
