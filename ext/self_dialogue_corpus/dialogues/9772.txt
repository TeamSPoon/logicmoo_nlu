So who do you like better, the old Kanye, or the new Kanye?
The old Kanye, hand's down. The College Dropout and Graduation are classics.
I completely agree, I'm still in awe at how amazing 'Through the Wire' was. He rapped that with his jaw wired shut!
Right? And honestly I still listen to 'The New Workout Plan' every time I go for a run.
So did you not like his new stuff at all?
Oh no, I just prefer the old Kanye, but I did really like 'Life of Pablo.'
I did too, and you know what's funny? The song 'I Love Kanye' where he raps 'I miss the old Kanye.'
Hahaha! 'I miss the old Kanye, straight from the go Kanye.'
'Chop up the soul Kanye, set on his goals Kanye.' But can we both agree 'Yeezus' was one of the worst albums of all time?
Oh I don't know about that ... I really liked BLKKK SKKKN HEAD.
