Who is the best rapper in your opinion
I love Eminem
What! He is so overrated. i hate him
Why is that?
His lyrics are all a bunch of jokes. Maybe back when Lose Yourself debuted he was great but now he is terrible
What recent stuff have you heard.
I heard that one song he was featured in by Big Sean
No favors?
yeah that song
Yeah it was pretty weak in my opinion
