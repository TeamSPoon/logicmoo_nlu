Can I play basketball after school?
Yes. Do you like playing?
I love it.
Are you good at it?
I'm good at making baskets but I need to be more aggressive.
Why's that?
If you're not people take the ball from you.
I see. How do you get better at that?
I guess just practice. I will do that today.
Do you want me to practice with you later?
Sure. We can do that after dinner.
I'd like that too.
I have to work on dribbling too.
Is that where you bounce the bal over and over?
Sort of but there's more to it.
Is that hard to do?
Yes, kind of.
I hope you can get better at that too. We'll work on that as well.
Thanks for offering to help me.
No problem at all.
