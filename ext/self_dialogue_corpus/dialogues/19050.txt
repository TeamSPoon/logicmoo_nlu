So I noticed you seem to like songs that tell a story.
Yeah! Like Tupac's Violent, and Lynard Skynard's Gimme Three Steps.
Nice!
I don't like songs that are a bunch of words thrown together for the sake of finishing a song or for the sake of rhyming.
You'd probably like Harper Valley PTA then.
Who does it?
I'm not sure who did it originally, but Dolly Parton's version is pretty well known.
I'll have to check it out. What's it about?
Well it's from the point of view of this mom, talking about what happens with her daughter at school and there's kind of a surprising end.
I'm all about that. I'll have to check it out.
Yeah, you can find several versions on youtube.
Sounds good. What style of music is it?
It's kind of countryish I guess?
Ew, you know I can't stand country.
But hopefully the story in it will outweigh that for you!
I hope so.
I found that it provokes really good imagery. Like it was really easy to imagine everything that's narrated.
I like that in a song. I like that about Violent.
What is that?
Sounds like we need to exchange some music!
