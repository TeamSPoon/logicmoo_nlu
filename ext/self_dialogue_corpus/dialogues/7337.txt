What was your favorite Disney movie when you were growing up?
I'd probably have to say Lady and the Tramp.
What makes you pick that one?
I remember it so well from my childhood. I really liked some of the songs too.
Did it make you want a dog of your own?
Of course it did. Wouldn't all children want a dog after watching it?
What was your favorite part of the movie?
I liked it when the tramp broke into the house to save the baby from the rat.
Didn't the people think the tramp was a bad dog?
Aunt Sara certainly did, but everything turned out in the end when they realized he was protecting the baby.
