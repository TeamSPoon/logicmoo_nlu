Did you hear they are making a bio pic on the life of Qandeel Baloch?
Who in the world is Qandeel Baloch?
She was the Pakistani social media model whose brother killed her for "bringing shame on their family."
Oh yes I heard of her. Didn't they call her the Kim Kardashian of Pakistan?
Yes they did, but not many people in the West knew who she was until the Honor Killing.
What did she do that brought shame on the family?
She made several videos and posted them on social media, dressed provocatively, doing suggestive things such as stripteasing and lying sprawled in bed, proposing to sports celebrities and even politicians.
That doesn't sound like something to be killed for.
Not to us in the Western World, but in society there she was considered a shameful disgrace.
That's horrible. Hopefully her death will shed light on these so called Honor Killings.
Yes, hopefully. I believe Pakistan has now made these killings illegal, but it doesn't seem to be stopping people, especially in rural, poverty-stricken areas.
What happened to her brother?
I believe he's in jail right now. We'll have to wait until the movie comes out to find out more.
Do you think the movie will be released in the West?
I doubt it, but we'll be able to find it online or probably rent it through Amazon Prime or something.
Hopefully with English subtitles, otherwise what would be the point for us to watch it.
Yes, you're right. If the film makers are hoping to shine a light on this injustice, they need to make the movie accessible to everyone.
I agree! Maybe some good civilian will upload a version of the movie with their own subtitles. What is the name of the film going to be?
It will be titled Bhaagi
I'll have to remember that.
