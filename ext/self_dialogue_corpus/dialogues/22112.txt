Want to pick up a movie tonight?
Sure. Anything sound good to you?
I've been wanting to watch Fences.
I've heard a mixed reveiw on that one.
Oh yeah?
I heard Denzel went a little overboard.
I can't imagine. He was nominated for the Oscar.
Yeah, but I don't really put much stock in the Oscars.
Yeah, seems more political than anything.
Once in a while they get it right.
Like when?
Didn't Dearly Departed win best picture one year?
Oh, yeah! And No Country for Old Men.
That was a great film.
Hard to believe it was a Cohen Brothers flick.
Yeah, a bit off beat for them.
Theyr'e always off beat!
True. That's why they're so good.
I agree.
So, what are we going to watch?
