I noticed you really like Maroon 5's latest hit. Have you listened to some of their earlier stuff?
Yeah, I have! I really liked the album Songs About Jane.
Me too. I think that one is probably their best. I think my favorite track is Secret.
That's a good song, I like it too!
If you like Maroon 5, you would probably like Matchbox Twenty.
Hmm...why does that artist sound familiar?
Remember the song Push from the 90's?
Oh, yeah! That was Matchbox Twenty?
Yeah, and the other popular one that got a lot of radio airplay was How Far We've Come.
Oh, okay. Well, those are the only two songs I know by them.
They have a lot of slow rock songs in their album More Than You Think You Are.
Oh really? I love smooth, slow rock.
Yeah, you'd love this album. It was released in 2002, so it's got a lot of angsty rock in it, too.
They sound like a strong band. Would you say they're similar to Shinedown?
Shinedown? The band that did Sound of Madness?
Yeah, that's them. They also did Second Chance.
Yeah, I guess you could say that Matchbox Twenty is similar to Shinedown.
Cool! Thanks for the recommendation.
You're welcome! Remember: Matchbox Twenty.
You got it! I won't forget.
