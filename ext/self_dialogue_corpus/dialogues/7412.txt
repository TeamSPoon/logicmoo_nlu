Have you been to see the latest, 2017 version of Beauty and the Beast?
You mean the one with Emma Watson as Beauty and Dan Stevens as the Beast?
Yes that one! I haven't seen it yet have you?
No, but I really want to.
I want to see how Dan Stevens plays the Beast. I enjoyed him so much in Downton Abbey, and this is a very different role for him!
I'll say, and it's also a pretty big switch for Emma.
I heard that Emma sings in this movie.
They probably all do, don't you think?
Maybe, I guess that is likely. I really enjoyed the music of the older version from 1991.
You mean the animated one. Yes, that had an awesome soundtrack. Maybe this one does too.
