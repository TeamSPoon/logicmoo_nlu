Do you listen to Pink?
Oh, I love her!
Yeah, she's such a good singer.
She kind of doesn't get the recognition she deserves.
I know what you mean.  She has tons of hits.
She's been active for like twenty years.
Really?  That long.
I'd say it's close.  I remember having her CD in the late nineties or early 2000s.
Wow.  What were the songs on that CD?
I don't really remember.  It was good, but had more of a hip-hop sound.
Wasn't she on the Moulin Rouge soundtrack?
Yeah, she did that song with all those other girls.
Yeah, I remember that.
Do you know she's related to Mandy Moore?
The actress?  Really?
Yeah.  Pink's actual name is Alicia Moore.
How are they related?
I think they are second or third cousins.
Mandy Moore used to sing.  Did they ever record together?
I'm not sure, but I don't think so.
