I just bought Lady Gaga's new album.
I didn't know she'd released a new one. What's it called?
The album's name is Joanne. Have you heard any of the singles from it?
I've heard Perfect Illusion and Million Reasons.
I love Million Reasons! I sing along to it in the car.
I don't know. I like her older songs better.
Do you mean the ones from Artpop or the ones from The Fame?
I like The Fame better, but I also like Born This Way. The Fame had the most unique stuff.
I'd never heard anything like Bad Romance before she made that song.
Gaga brought a new style to pop music, and she's also got an incredible voice that you can hear best in songs like The Edge of Glory.
