Who do you think is the best R&B artist around?
Well, he's not strictly R&B but it's gotta be Frank Ocean.
He's my pick too. Dude has got talent.
So much talent. Hasn't put out a dud yet.
Well, everyone likes Channel Orange, but the story is a bit different for Blonde.
What do you mean?
A lot of people don't connect with it. It's too difficult or weird or whatever.
Yeah, it's not straight up poppy R&B in the way people were expecting.
I know, I think people really wanted that one gigantic single like Think of U and they didn't get it.
That's a good point and why I'm thinking that he's the best sometimes R&B artist. He has songs on Blonde that sound like The Shins.
So true. White Ferrari has moments that could be off Oh Inverted World by The Shins.
It's weird because I was thinking it was gonna be similar to Little Red Corvette.
Nope! Not at all.
Not at all. Although, I will say for certain that Prince is a great influence on Frank.
Yeah, he's mentioned it in interviews before.
Yeah, I've read some. After Prince passed away last year, Frank Ocean posted "When You Were Mine" by Prince on Tumblr.
That's an absolute gem of a song that not too many people know.
But back to Blonde, there are songs on there where Frank does really odd things with pitching vocals.
Yeah, like Nikes is not a radio track at all.
At all, but I'm really glad to see he's doing what's pleasing his artistic sense.
