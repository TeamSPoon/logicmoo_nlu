Were you ever a Kiss fan?
No, but I like the visuals.
Heard their music much?
No, come to think of it. Just 2 or 3 hits.
I hear you. I was deceived into thinking they were all flash and no musical substance.
How so? Hmm.
My brother gave me the impression they just had cool makeup but were generic rock n' roll.
That turned out not to be true?
Not at all. Even the early stuff has some cool melodic bass and pop elements that set them apart.
So, it's not just blues rock or typical hard rock of the era?
Definitely not. It's more like if you combined some earlier rock n' roll elements with a more melodic approach, plus hard rock of the '70s.
Interesting. Didn't expect that of them.
Gene Simmons is a huge Paul McCartney fan, and a lot of his influence comes through in the bass lines.
That's really weird when combined with that "demon" makeup.
For sure. I almost haven't fully registered it myself!
Yeah. Didn't they do Hard Luck Woman?
Yes, and crazily enough, that was originally intended for Rod Stewart.
Ha! Sounds like it, too.
Another nutty fact: Peter Criss studied under Gene Krupa of all people.
Well, this certainly sounds like a new discovery. That's even less expected if anything.
