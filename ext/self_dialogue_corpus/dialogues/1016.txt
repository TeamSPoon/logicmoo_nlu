Hey, how is your team gearing up for the new NFL season?
Well, you know I am a Patriots fan, right?
I do. How do you think they are going to do.
Easy, they are going to repeat! No question in my mind.
Well that is pretty confident when we have a whole season to play.
It is, but I think that will the personnel and coaches we have it should be in the bag.
I don't know that I would be so confident. There are some other teams that look pretty good this year.
There are, but are there any that can match up to the Patriots?
I think that the Cowboys have a good shot this year.
Really? I mean, I know they have potential to be good, but I don't think they will be the best.
I think that they are going to suprise people and be in the hunt at the end of the season.
Why are you so sure of that?
Same reason as you. They have good personnel and coaches.
I guess we will have to see how it shakes out. Dak Prescott is pretty good, I will give you that.
I saw something saying the top three teams likely to play in the Super Bowl are the Patriots, the Packers, and the Cowboys.
I would love to see any of them, as long as the Pats are there.
We will see, I feel like this season will be full of suprises.
I could see that.
I would love to see my Chiefs sneak up on people.
They have a chance. They had a decent year last year.
