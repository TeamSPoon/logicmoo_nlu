Okay, so Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs was the first Disney movie to come out, but what was the first Disney Pixar movie?
I believe it was Toy Story.
That makes sense, I know that came out in 1995 because I was six years old.
Yeah, that sounds about right and i for sure can't remember anything coming out made by Disney-Pixar before Toy Story.
Good point. I also remember it being three dimensional and innovative at the time.
Yeah, I take that for granted now that three dimensional animation wasn't always a thing.
Definitely a game changer.
Definitely. The whole brand of Pixar is premised on that style of animation.
I guess that's right, huh?
Yeah, regular Disney movies can be animated or non-animated in a number of ways. Pixar's movies tend to be three dimensional animation.
