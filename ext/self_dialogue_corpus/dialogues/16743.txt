Do you like rap music?
I dont mind it, theres not a whole lot of artists I like though.
Who is one of them?
I would say Eminem.
He is probably the greatest of all time.
Yeah lately though is music has been lackluster.
He is getting old.
Yeah but part of his allure has subsided.
In what way?
He isnt being as controversial as he used to be.
That can come with age.
Yeah but mostly because I think he has matured and realized he cant be that way anymore.
That was what made his music so special, he did not care.
I agree with you but it is what it is.
The Slim Shady album was so great.
He knew how to intertwine lyrics really well.
He also had a great producer.
I think anyone could have dealt with him.
Yeah but this guy took the lyrics and laced them with great beats.
I think his lyrics transcended even a weak studio producer.
