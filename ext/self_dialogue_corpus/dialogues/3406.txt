Have you seen a good creative horror movie lately?
Yes, The Babadook. Have you seen that?
No, what in the world is a Babadook?
The Babadook is a creature that appears in this fictional children's book the main character's son wants her to read to him. Except it starts appearing in real life.
Sounds like one of those CGI monster movies.
No, they actually used a lot of practical effects! The monster and other elements are presented in this beautifully bizarre way, but without a lot of digital effects.
Oh that sounds interesting. Who is it by?
A new director named Jennifer Kent. The movie takes place in Australia but I am not sure if she is Australian herself.
How long is the movie?
About an hour and a half. It is based on a short film but I never saw that.
