Did you go see Rogue One when it was in theaters?
Of course I did. I'm a huge Star Wars fan.
Are you? I am too. I started when I was a kid.
Oh yes, I grew up on the three original. I would watch them over and over again at a friend's house every weekend.
Which one was your favorite?
Probably The Empire Strikes Back. What about you?
Oh definitely the first one. I'm a purist.
What did you think of Rogue One then?
I thought it was amazing, like they really nailed the style of the old films.
I totally agree. It felt more like one of the originals than the new ones like Force Awakens.
Maybe it's because it was set in the old plotline, with Darth Vader even.
Oh right! And there was that crazy scene at the end linking the two films?
Yeah! With new Princess Leia footage that they made digitally. Amazing technology.
It was. It was a little creepy to make new Grand Moff Tarkin scenes when they actor is dead.
Yeah, I wonder how Peter Kushing's family felt about it.
Other than that it was a really impressive film!
I can't get over how great the effects were.
That death star in the sky scene was so awesome, and scary really.
Right? Like imagine staring that down on your planet.
What a great scene!
