So what are your thoughts on Lady Gaga?
I think she's a pretender.
What do you mean by that?
She just tries to copy what Madonna did in the 1980's.
I can see what you mean.
She just acts weird and dresses up to get attention and sell albums.
Well isn't that what every pop artist does?
I think some of them have musical merit.
You are pretty tough on her.
She's just a reproduction of all the gimmicks that have come before.
