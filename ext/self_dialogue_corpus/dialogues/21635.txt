Do you remember the movie Leaving Las Vegas?
Of course!  That's definitely one of my favorite Nicholas Cage movies.
Yeah, me too!  And it was actually based off of a book.
Yeah, I read the book.  The book is somewhat better than the movie, though.
Yeah, it always is.  But the movie was a great rendition of the book.
It makes me cry at the end!  I think Elizabeth Shue and Cage do a great job in their roles.
They really do, and it portrays the tragedy of alcoholism and love so accurately.
Yes, true.  Didn't it win some kind of awards?
I think it did but I can't say for sure.  Nicholas Cage has been in so many movies!
I know!  He's like Kevin Bacon.
Yeah, I wonder who has been in more?
I don't know, I'm sure we could google it and find out.
True.  Well, I might have to re-watch Leaving Las Vegas soon.
Yeah, it's definitely one to watch again and again.
It's a little hard for me to sympathize with the characters because they are such lowlifes, but on the same token I feel pity for them.
Yeah that's what makes it such a beautiful movie I think.
True.  It picks up on the tragedy of human life.
Yeah, and it has an unexpected ending.
I love a good unexpected ending!  So many movies these days are so predictable.
I know.  They don't make them like they used to.
