Did you hear Chris Cornell from Soundgarden passed away?
Yes, that was a shame. It seems a lot of musicians have been passing away the past couple years.
I know, Prince was a big shocker for everyone when he passed. Which singer did you like better?
I"m a big Prince fan. I loved Purple Rain.
I like Soundgarden better. Did you ever get to see Prince in concert?
No, but I sure would have liked to.
I never saw Prince, but I saw Soundgarden several times.
How was their concerts?
Wonderful mosh pits, with all the people singing along to the songs.
You're lucky you got to see them.
