Have you heard of CALL ME MAYBE by Carly Rea Jepsen?
Yes, she looks at the guy fixing his car.
She is washing the car in high heels.
She is trying to get his attention while washing the car.
When he does see her she falls off the car.
I think she hits her head.
She dreams about him.
Then he comes over to help.
She sings for him.
But he gives his number the guy other guy.
