Do you like Will Ferrell?
I love Will Ferrell! What's your favorite of his movies?
It's so hard to pick. I love 'Step Brothers'.
Me too - 'Anchorman' is a classic, though.
It's crazy how long ago that movie came out and it's still so quoted.
Did you see 'Anchorman 2'?
I didn't, and I heard it wasn't that great.
Yeah, it wasn't that great. Nowhere near as good as the first one.
I watch 'Elf' every Christmas. One of the only funny Christmas movies I can remember from recently.
Yeah, it's definitely the funniest Christmas movie in many years.
