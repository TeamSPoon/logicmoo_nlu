Are you a Star Trek fan?
Kind of.  Why?
I saw Star Trek Beyond and thought it was pretty good.  Did you see that one?
I did go see that one.  I like the later Star Trek films like JJ Abrams'.
Oh I see.  So what did you think of this last one.
I enjoyed it, but not on the same level as JJ's films.
Why's that?
The director is good.  Maybe because there wasn't a lot going on.
The story wasn't as compelling.
It was kind of an average story.  I loved what they did with the deep space station though.
Right.  Gorgeous computer graphics.
Mainly the story was about stranded on a planet.  Not so exciting.
Not for me.  And they used a young girl as an alien to keep things interesting, but it wasn't.
Not like Benedict Cumberbatch.
I guess not!
So this latest Star Trek film has a half thumbs up from me.
Ha ha I can relate.
So with the next Star Trek film, I hope they heat things up.
That might depend on the director.
Yep.  Too bad its not JJ.
