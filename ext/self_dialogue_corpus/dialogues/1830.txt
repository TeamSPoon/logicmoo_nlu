Hey, how do you feel about the upcoming season?
Kind of depressed, actually!
Why?
I'm a Jets fan and I feel like we don't have any of our long-time guys anymore.
Yeah, that's true. Who did you lose?
We got rid of Mangold, Harris, Decker, and Marshall.
That's rough.  Didn't Marshall go to the Giants, too?
Yeah, which makes it even worse.  I'm happy for him though.
He seems like a good guy.
Yeah, I like that he took a stand a few years ago and wore the green cleats for mental health awareness.
Is there any chance that any of the other AFC East teams knock off the Pats?
Probably not, but we'll see how Tannehill comes back from injury.
The Dolphins are always a little bit better than they should be.
And the Bills are always a little bit worse than they should be.
It honestly has not been fair for over a decade with Bellichick and Brady running the show.
Yeah, but I think it might be more Bellichick than Brady.
Why?
Well when Brady is hurt or suspended they continue to win.
The Pats won't lose the East until they're both gone.
That's probably true.
