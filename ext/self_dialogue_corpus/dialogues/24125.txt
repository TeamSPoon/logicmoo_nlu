My niece is staying with us this weekend and I need to come up with some movies she can watch.
How old is she?
She's eight.
What kind of movies does she like?
She likes movies about animals.
How about The Secret Life of Pets.
She's already seen it. In fact, she has seen all of the newer animal movies.
So something older then?
That would work best.
There;s Free Willy.
Oh the one about the whale?
That's the one.
I saw that a long time ago and liked it.
There's also A Dolphin's Tale.
What's it about?
It's about a rescued dolphin that needs an artificial tale.
I don't know if that seems that interesting.
If you liked Free Willy, then you will like A Dolphin's Tale.
I'll take your word for it.
I don't think you'll be disappointed.
