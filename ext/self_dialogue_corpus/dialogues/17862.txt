What do you think of Jethro Tull?
They are awesome.
I know, right. They had some of the best concerts out there.
Really.
They always have good music with a show, they even have large balls to bat around at first.
Balls?
Yeah, big rubber balls they push all over the hall.
OK.
Anyway, the music is awesome, they have clear sound, not too loud.
Really?
Yeah the flute sounds really good and the songs are clear.
Yeah, I heard some live songs.
It is really fun to watch, mainly when you know the songs and they seem to wait until the last second to play.
What?
You know you think they will miss their cue or mess up, they play their instrument just when they need to.
Oh, OK.
I have all of their albums and I like the live ones best.
Is that because you have seen their concerts?
Yep, I just want to see them again.
I want to see them now.
