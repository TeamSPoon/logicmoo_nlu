Have you had a chance to watch Knucklebones yet?
I watched it and wish I didn't.
I see what you meant.
That is a terrible movie. I would rather spend 90 minutes at the dentist.
Yeah, with the strange acting, massive plot holes, and simply bizarre happenings all around, this movie never should have been made.
Or at least it could have been done better.
Why is it that young white adults are the ones who are starting trouble or causing it?
I was thinking the same thing. What do they be thinking?
Another movie about bored students students and some really bad acting and fake blood.
Don't forget the deep satanic voice.
I was trying to.
Even though I liked the idea of movie he acting and effects were dumb.
They should have paid the audience to watch it.
It felt as though they were trying far too hard, to be interesting and original.
True. I think it would have been better off basking in its "B" grade glory and just sticking with a simpler slasher flick premise.
The story made no sense to me.
If you think about it,  the movie gets very close to porn, which is what this whole stupid movie really wants to be.
Might have been better that way.
You're probably right.
I just hope they don't do a sequel.
