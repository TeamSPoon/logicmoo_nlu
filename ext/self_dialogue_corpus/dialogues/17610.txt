How do you like The Mountain Goats?
Never heard of them. Who are they?
They're an American rock band led by John Darnielle.
What's their music like?
Kind of indie folk-rock. They've got really good lyrics.
What are the lyrics like?
They often tell stories. Of outsiders and funny-sad moments.
Could you give me an example?
Well, there's a song called The Best Ever Death Metal Band in Denton. It's brilliant.
I already like the title.
Yeah, it's sad and funny and empathetic all in one.
Awesome. What other songs do you like?
There's another song called This Year. It's great.
Does it have great lyrics?
You bet. The chorus goes "I'm gonna make it through this year, if it kills me"
That's a killer line. I'm going to quote it.
For sure. It's from the Sunset Tree, a great album.
What's their latest album?
Their latest is called Goths. It's about goths
Excellent
