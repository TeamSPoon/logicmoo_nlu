What is your take on all these new Sci-fi films?
There are a few supehero ones that are good, some of the other ones are not so great.
Like the Martian?
Yes, I really did not get into that one at all. Interstellar was better, by far.
I thought that movie played out well. Did you see the new Alien remake?
Ugh, yes so boring. I think they have done too many of those.
Alien Vs. Predator was not so boring, did you like that one.
No, I still think the old ones were way better.
I think Sc-fi movies have really changed in recent years.
They are more focused on making them more real I think . like they could happen. Unlike stuff like the Matrix.
The Matrix was the best Sci-fi film ever made.
The first one?
The first one, all of them as a whole. Masterpieces.
You think so?I liked them. I do not think they were the best.
What do you think was the best SCi-fi film then?
Excluding Star Wars, of course, I would say, Wall- E.
You are joking.
No, I think it was a really good science fiction.
It was not even, it was a cartoon.
Yes, but the story was played well and it was written as a Sci-fi.
