Who is your favorite rapper of all time?
That's tough. Do you mean my personal favorite, or who I think is the most skilled?
How about both?
I think it's hard to discount Jay-Z as perhaps the best overall rapper.
Why do you say that?
He has a great combination of lyrical prowess, technical ability, and mainstream appeal.
I get that.
He also has paid his dues. He's been in the game for a long time.
What's your favorite Jay-Z album?
A lot of fans will will Reasonable Doubt or The Blueprint, but I think The Black Album is his magnum opus.
All three of those are great.
In terms of how I personally favor, though, I've got to go with Andre 3000 from OutKast.
I don't think anyone is going to disagree with you there.
There are few groups with such consistently great records. You can't even say that about Jay-Z.
What's your favorite OutKast album?
Probably Aquemeni, however I think the double album Speakerboxxx/The Love Below is amazing.
I like Andre, but I think his partner Big Boi is often overlooked.
I agree! Speakerboxxx was a great solo effort and proved that Big Boi could hold his own.
I think Idlewild is probably their weakest album.
I think so too, but it's still great, which goes to show how good OutKast is.
