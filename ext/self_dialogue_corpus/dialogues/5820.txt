Have you seen Beauty and the Beast?
Of course! It's one of my favorite movies of all time.
Do you think you would like to live in the castle with all the furniture talking to you?
Yeah, that would be awesome, Cogsworth and Lumiere would be my best friends.
What about The Little Mermaid? have you seen that one?
Dude, I can sing all the songs.
That's awesome, how about the Lion King?
Well of course, I know all about that one, too. Simba and Rafiki and Mufasa.
