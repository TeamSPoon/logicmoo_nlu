Man I am so bored at work
You know what I do when i'm bored I go on Spotify and just randomly select someones playlist
No kidding, is Spotify free
Yes you just need to download the app from your phone or desktop
Awesome that may just save the day, what kind of music do you listen to typically?
Usually i'm more into mainline Screamo or Metal
Oh Yeah what bands?
Right now i'm on a "Bullet for My Valentine" playlist
I think I have heard of them before aren't they similar to Metallica?
Yes they are pretty close, I would recommend trying out some of there music
I think I will, maybe some Metallica too while i'm at it.
If you haven't heard the newest song from Metallica check it out
Is it closer to music from Injustice for All?
Yes its very close to older Metallica in style
That was the best, One and Blackened are my favorites
Mine too, you cannot get any better than those old songs
Did you know that Dave Mustaine the lead singer of Metallica originally played for Metallica?
No I wasn't aware
Yeah if he hadn't left we never would have had Megadeth
That would have been a shame
