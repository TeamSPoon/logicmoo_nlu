You're a big Lady Antebellum fan, aren't you?
I am, why's that?
I just heard their new-ish song, "You Look Good" and I thought of you.
It's a fun song, isn't it?
Makes me want to take the boat out and soak up the sun!
It's the perfect summer song.
What other country songs would you recommend for Summer 2017?
I think Brett Young's "In Case You Didn't Know" is the sweetest song. That came out in February, but perfect for summer love.
Has Florida Georgia Line released anything? They're my go-to summer country band.
Nothing since last August. But I think you can play "Summerland" a few more times this year.
Most country music is so silly--beer, girls, dirt roads, and church. But that's what summer calls for.
You're right. I don't want to be thinking too deeply when I'm at the Outer Banks for the week.
There are so many great Carolina songs for that mood!
Eric Church's "Carolina"?
Or "Feels like Carolina" by Parmalee?
One hit wonder, but also a good song.
What's your number one summer country song of all time?
It's gotta be "Toes" by Zac Brown Band. What about you?
"Barefoot Blue Jean Summer" by Jake Owen, no question!
I think it's time to go to the beach and blast some country tunes!
