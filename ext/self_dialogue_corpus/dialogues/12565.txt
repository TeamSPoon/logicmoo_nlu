Do you like Star Wars?
Yes, of course!
What was your favorite movie?
I have to say the first one!
As in A New Hope or as in The Phantom Menace?
A New Hope of course! I wasn't really a fan of episodes 1-3.
Yeah me neither.
What about you? What was your favorite.
I really liked the most recent one, The Force Awakens!
Me too, it was really good.
