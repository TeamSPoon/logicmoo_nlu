Who is your favorite actor?
That is way too broad a question.
How is that Broad, it's a basic Question?
No, cause you didn't specify genre or medium.
Ok, you've lost me now.
Well I have a few favorites, but they work in movies, TV, horror, comedy, etc. and you didn't ask me any of that.
Fine, Movies, Comedy, anything else mister picky?
Ok then, no we have a question. Comedy Movies, definitely Jim Carey.
That was not worth you going through all those details.
Well if you had said Action Movies then I'd have said Gerard Butler.
Ok now you're just making it weirder.
Hey you're the one that's going around asking unanswerable questions.
So you're saying if Jim Carey and Gerard Butler were in a movie together, you couldn't pick your favorite.
Yes that is exactly what I'm saying, but I watch watch that movie many, many times.
Well in any case, Jim Carey was actually my favorite too, ever since he was the Riddler.
That was a great Batman, he was the only option for that too.
Well he does have a great ere of enthusiasm around him in pretty much all of his movies.
Well even though he's not my favorite thriller actor, I did love him in the number 23. It was incredible.
We're not starting that again, but I agree that movie was pretty good.
It's not my fault that narrowing the range of talents we see on those twinkling screens to a generic skill set is just wrong to me.
