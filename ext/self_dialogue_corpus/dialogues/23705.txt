Who is the best actor?
ever or still acting?
Ever.
I happen to like Daniel Day Lewis.
He is good. I Think I am going with Tom Hanks
I like Hanks too, but as far as simply acting goes Daniel Day Lewis has him beat
I don't know Tom Hanks has a wide range and he can do comedy
Daniel Day Lewis becomes his roles. He will do anything to get the part right
He also has not done as many movies. Tom Hanks is more Likeable
Daniel Day Lewis became Lincoln. He was Bill the Butcher, and His character in There Will be Blood. He was those characters.
I think Tom Hanks can do the same. He was Forrest Gump. He was the Captain in Saving Private Ryan
Daniel Day Lewis takes on fewer roles because the roles he does get he perfects.
Daniel Day Lewis still can't do comedy.
Just because he hasn't done it much doesn't mean he can't do it. Comedy isn't as skilled
Comedy is almost more skilled. Look at Chaplin, and the fact that Tom Hanks can do both drama and comedy makes it for me.
I like Tom Hanks, but I think the roles Daniel Day Lewis has done makes him a better actor
I like Daniel Day Lewis. I simply think Tom Hanks is more rounded and has better movies overall
Ok then. What is Tom Hanks best performance?
Forrest Gump. What is Daniel Day Lewis' best performance?
There Will be Blood.
