Have you seen Rogue One?
Yes, The ending was so sad.
Right? I really liked Jyn and Cassian.
They both would have been good long term characters.
I guess their story had to go how it did so that it blends into the original three movies.
True, but I would have made the robot for more future movies rather than an earlier story.
Oh K-2S0? Yeah C-3P0 seems to be a step back in intelligence.
I think so too. K-2S0 is much more advanced in interaction and of course humor.
Absolutely! I loved the banter between him and the human characters.
That was some of the best dialog in the movie.
