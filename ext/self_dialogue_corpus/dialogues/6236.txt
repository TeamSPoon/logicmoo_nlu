Have you seen the new Beauty and the Beast movie?
Yes! I loved the remake, and the music was fantastic.
I could listen to the soundtrack all day.
Me too. I think I loved this version of Gaston the most.
He was obnoxious in the most adorable way..
So was Belle's father.
The part where he met Beast was one of my favorite parts.
He did look menacing, didn't he.
But, that ending! Those dresses.
Very well done, and such beautiful colors were used.
