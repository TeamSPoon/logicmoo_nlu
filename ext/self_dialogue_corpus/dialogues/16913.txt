I just got some new guitar strings. Gonna put them on.
You play guitar? and change your own strings?
Yeah, I played from like 8 to 30 or so. Got pretty good, then got busy with life and such.
So you're picking it up again, no pun intended?
Haha yeah, and boy am I rusty! A few years ago somebody handed me their guitar and while I used to wow people with Under the Double Eagle, I just froze.
Under the Double Eagle?
Bluegrass. Hard picking. You've heard it, everyone has.
What else do you play?
My favorites from childhood/youth were James Taylor, Cat Stevens, and, yes. John Denver. eek.
Haha yeah, John Denver is pretty cringworthy, but still he was really good and fitting for his time.
Yeah, when every young girl wore overall jeans, had Kristy McNichol hair and nature shows like Grizzly Adams were in.
Yes - remember John Denver Christmas specials?
Yes! Always in some transparent dome thingie in the Colorado Rockies. Like a John Denver snow globe haha.
Sad he died so young. He definitely had some good environmental activism left in him.
Yeah. I don't play his stuff any more though, too goofy.
Do you play classical at all?
Nah, I did a little at first but didn't like the nylong strings and wider guitar neck and all that long fingernail stuff haha.
You could use picks?
Yeah, I was just being funny. Now I have a few classical pieces I wish I could play.
Once you get the rust out you can try!
