I just saw Curandero.
I heard about that.  Any good?
Not bad.  Spanish flick about a Satanic cult.
Who is in the movie?
Carlos Gallardo and Gizeht Galatea.
I heard about her.  She's hot!
Oh yes, and tough too.  She plays a cop.
Neat.  What happens in the end?
The curandero does his job.  He and the cop survive.
I'm glad they make it out alive.
