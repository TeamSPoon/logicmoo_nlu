I hate watching some of the NFL games, when good teams play against teams that just aren't any good.
I think most if not all of the teams are good though, aren't they?
Some are total trash.
Well in any league, in any sport, there will always be teams at the bottom.
That is true, expect in some leagues the bottom teams get relegated if they don't do well. It doesn't work like that in the NFL.
If you had to demote a team, which one would you kick out of the league?
The Cleveland Browns.
I've never even heard of them!
Exactly my point..
Are they a new team?
Not at all! They've been in the NFL for about 50 years.
Why haven't I heard of them?
Have you heard of the Baltimore Ravens?
Of course I have. You wouldn't demote them as well would you?
No I wouldn't. The Ravens was actually born out of the Browns as an expansion team.
When was this? I don't remember any of this happening.
This happened back in the 90's. Ever since then the Brown just have never been able to hold their own.
That's rough. I'm guessing they play in the American Football Conference?
Yes they do. They've never even ever made it to the Superbowl.
I'm going to have to do some reading up on them, but I do see your point. They don't sound like a team I'd want to go see play.
