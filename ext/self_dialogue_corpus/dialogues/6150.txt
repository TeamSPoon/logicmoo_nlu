Have you ever seen Aladdin?
Yes. I like the Genie.
Robin Williams was great at that part! That was the first movie I saw in theatres.
I think mine was The Lion King.
The Lion King is my favorite of the Disney classics.
I don't really have a favorite of the classics. But my favorite one overall is Toy Story.
I really liked Toy Story too. I was really impressed that the sequels were just as good as the original.
Yeah, that doesn't usually happen with sequels. Just look at Little Mermaid and Lion King.
I know! I didn't even see those sequels.
They weren't that great.
