What did you think of Rogue One?
I liked it. What did you think?
I liked it too, but it wasn't my favorite.
Why not?
None of the characters seemed really fleshed out.
Yeah, I thought that way too.
I thought it was fine, but I didn't understand the huge hype.
Neither did I, to be honest.
Still, it was good.
I agree.
