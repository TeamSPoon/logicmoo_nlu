We watched Moana last night!
You did?  What did you think?
I really, really liked it.  I think she might be my new favorite Disney princess.
I like her too!
She is strong and determined.
I also like that there wasn't a love story.
Yeah, it seems like most of the Disney princesses are mostly focused on love.
Exactly!  Moana doesn't need a prince.
My daughter really like Maui too.
I didn't care for him at first but liked him by the end.
