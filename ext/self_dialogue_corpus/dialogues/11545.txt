Which Beatles album is your favorite?
I like the compilation albums, like the Black Album.
So you like more of their popular music.
Yes.  What about you?
Oh, I definitely love the classics - Hey Jude. Let it Be. I Want to Hold Your Hand.
Do you know the meaning behind some of the music?
Yes.  I'm aware that Blackbird is about racism in the 60s.
Did you know that You've Got to Hide Your Love Away is about their manager who was homosexual?
Oh, interesting.  That makes sense though.
Yes. And there are some amazing modern covers of their songs as well.
