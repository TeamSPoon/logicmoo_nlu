Would you like to make some popcorn and watch a movie?
Sure, what kind of movie are we going to watch?
I have the perfect one in mind. It is called Sleeping With The Enemy.
Sounds interesting. Who is in it?
It stars Julia Roberts, one of your favirotes!
Great, so what is it about?
Roberts stars as an abused wife who goes on the run in search of a better life.
This sounds like a movie that I am going to enjoy.
I hope So! It is a movie that will make you not want to miss a second of it.
Great, let's get it started!
