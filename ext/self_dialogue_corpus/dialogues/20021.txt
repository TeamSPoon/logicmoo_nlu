What do you have planned this weekend?
I was gonna go camping at the state park.
I can't say I have ever done that.
Well you really should try t some time, it's great.
I can't afford all the equipment though.
It's really not all that expensive.
I always thought you need a lot of gear and everything.
Not really I just take my tent and my sleeping bag.
But what do you do for food.
Well I have a nice little propane grill that I cook fish on.
So what's the point in going?
Well it's a great chance to get fresh air.
Just seems like a waste of time.
It's really not, it's a wonderful way to relax.
I like relaxing by the pool, with a cold drink in my hand.
Trust me it's fun, why don't you come with me?
I wouldn't want to impose.
You wouldn't be I have a two person tent, there is plenty of room.
I don't have anything to bring.
I have everything we need just meet me here Saturday.
