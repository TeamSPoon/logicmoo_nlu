I know you mentioned that you liked 112 from back in the day, they had so many great hits.
Yes they do! Way too many to name.
If you had to though which one do you like the best?
That's a tough one. But one of them is "Peaches and Cream."
Talk about a mood setting song.
Oh yes, that and Ginuwine are what I play when I feel frisky.
I love the song "What If" by 112.
What's that one about?
It's about a man who made a lot of mistakes and ruined his relationship with a woman. He regretted his choices.
Oh okay I see. I do think I saw the music video.
They were really popular.
Didn't they have an album come out in the 90s?
Yes they did in 1996, the album was just called 112.
Oh okay. I know that album has "Cupid" on it.
Oh I know that song, that's an old one.
Yes but a good one!
When I was graduating high school though their album "Pleasure and Pain" came out.
Which songs are on that album?
A lot of songs actually but a favorite was "U Already Know."
I know that song! It was one my sister played on the radio constantly.
