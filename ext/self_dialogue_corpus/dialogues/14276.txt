Did you see the playoff last night between the Wizards and the Celtics?
Yea I did! It was a pretty good game!
I know, I can't believe they were 2-1 in its series against the Boston Celtics.
It's unreal! They now have a 116-89 win at the Verizon Center behind 24 points, eight assists and three steals from John Wall.
Crazy. What about that game with Jazz and the Warriors?
Dude, I can't believe the Jazz hung in there!
Yea, they were pretty tough considering the Warriors steamrolled its way to an 18-point advantage through a quarter.
Let's talk about the stats my friend!
Okay, who do you want to start with?
Let's look at Kevin Durant!
He didn't give them a steal, he scored 25 points, 11 rebounds and seven assists.
He's definitely one of my favorites.
What about Stephen Curry?
That's my man!
He did great! Very impressive with 23 points and seven assists.
Never fail to impress me!
I think Draymond Green was on fire as well.
He played very well, 21 points, seven rebounds, six assists and four steals.
Super stoked! I can't wait for the next game.
I look forward to it!
