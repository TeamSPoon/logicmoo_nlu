What is your favorite baseball club?
The Boston Red Sox, what is your favorite?
I love the Red Sox too! Who is your favorite player on the team?
Pedroia, he's been so loyal to the team and he's hard not to love as a player, how about you?
I'm a former college pitcher, so I'd go with Price.
Wow, but he's really struggled in the playoffs in his career.
I think that's mostly just statistical variance, baseball has so much randomness and chance in it.
Yeah, I feel like ESPN and other sports publications try to make narratives and stories whether they exist or not.
Definitely, Price is a very skilled pitcher, and those skills will translate into playoff wins if he's given chances.
Do you think the Sox have what it takes to go all the way this year?
Haha, it's hard to say no. They were one of the favorites in the pre-season.
Yeah, I wonder if their relative youth will make a big playoff run harder.
Hopefully the guys with experience like my boy Pedroia will show them how it's done and be strong leaders.
Yeah, it's hard to underestimate the value of guys like that in the locker room.
What about Xander Bogaerts?
Oh man, he is awesome. I love watching him play.
Yeah, he really shows why the Red Sox have been so successful in the past 15 years.
Yeah, after so many issues for 70+ years, the front office and scouting teams really have stepped up their game!
Well here's to the Sox winning it all this year!
Hear hear! I hope Price will be the World Series MVP!
