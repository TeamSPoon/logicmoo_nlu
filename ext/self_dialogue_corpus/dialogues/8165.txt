How do you feel about country music making the pop music genre?
I think they should keep them seperate.
I do too. I think it forces artist to try to make music that will get into both markets.
Then they can increase revenue.
But plain pop music is the best. Have you heard of Onereplublic?
Counting Stars! Yes!
I've heard Katy Perry is making a come back too.
Who? What does she sing?
Last Friday night?
Oh yeah. Yeah of course. And dark horse too?
