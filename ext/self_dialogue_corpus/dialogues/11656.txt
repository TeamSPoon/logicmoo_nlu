Do you ever listen to the Beatles?
Sometimes I do.
They had so many great songs!
It's incredible the amount of albums they put out in so few years.
What is your favorite album?
I don't have a favorite, but I liked the later stuff.
Like Abbey Road?
Yeah, that and The White Album, Rubber Soul.
What about Sgt. Pepper?
That was okay too.
