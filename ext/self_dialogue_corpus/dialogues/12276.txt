Was The Force Awakens any good?
It was okay.
What did you like?
I liked the intro and I liked some of the puppets.
What didn't you like?
I did not like the huge death star planet, or the digital creations
I see what you mean
It was advertised as having a lot of puppets and I cannot remember any notable ones
There were a couple. But, there was way more digital stuff
I hope they do better on the next movie
