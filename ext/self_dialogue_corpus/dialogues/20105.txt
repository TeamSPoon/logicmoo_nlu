Have you seen the new movie, A Dog's Purpose?
I did see it. It was quite touching.
I liked it as well. I'm a dog lover so I thought it was great.
What about The Secret Life of Pets?
That's a hilarious movie!
I think so too, especially all the characters.
What about that movie, Why Him?
I saw it but I wasn't too thrilled about it.
Why not?
It seemed very unrealistic to me, at least I haven't encountered anyone like that.
Yea, I would go crazy if I had a son-in-law like that!
You know a movie I really haven't seen still?
What is it?
Trolls! It looks very family friendly.
I think it's very catchy and I liked Justin Timberlake's song.
Is it better than Moana?
I can't compare them, but they're equally great.
I liked the songs in Moana!
Yea and I liked that it was about Hawaii.
Definitely! It's different and refreshing.
