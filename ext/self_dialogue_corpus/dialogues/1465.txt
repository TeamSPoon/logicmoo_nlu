Alright, but how are we gonna get out?
Simple, we use the door.
Ummm.... (tries to open locked door) it's locked.
Oh great, now how are we going to get out?
Depends.
Uhhh, try using that crowbar.
Uhhh.... (Whacks crowbar at locked steel door). Doesn't work.
Okay, try ramming it using that lawn mower. Here's the keys.
Okay..... (rams the adamantium laser door with steel traps on it). Uhhh, does this door get even worse?
Somehow, it does.
Try and get Superman to break it down!
Hey, Superman, can ya beat down this door in MetLife Stadium? We're trapped!
(Superman comes down, tries to beat down the door, but sees Kryptonite on it as well) Superman says: "Maybe you should get Marshawn Lynch to do it." Superman flies away
Wait, what did he just say?
Uhhh, be right back, calling Marshawn Lynch.
Hey, Marshawn!
Hey, Cody!
Can ya help us out with this door? It's literally locked!
Yeah, let me just open it from the outside!
Marshawn Lynch opens it from the outside with his hands!
