So I just saw Mulan. That movie was epic!
I'm glad you liked it. It was about time Disney set one of their movies in China.
So was the movie based on a true historical story?
Most likely not. A lot of ancient Chinese legends are highly embellished to begin with. And to top it off Disney didn't even follow the source material very closely.
What do you mean? Mulan didn't actually dress up as a guy to fight the Huns?
Well she did, but the original had a lot more going on, and, to be honest, the original did not have a happy ending.
Well, then it makes sense that Disney decided to change the plot. You can't movie a movie about empowering girls only to end it on a tragic note.
Indeed, I'm not going to criticize Disney for exercising creative license here.
So what was your favorite part of the movie?
The Mulan Szechuan Sauce Mc'Donald's put out to celebrate the release. Don't laugh, that sauce changed my life.
