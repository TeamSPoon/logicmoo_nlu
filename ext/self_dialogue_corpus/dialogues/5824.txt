It's hard to beleive that Star Wars is a Disney franchise now.
Huh?
Yeah, Lucas sold out.
Figures.
At least they're doing a good job with it.
Yeah, the prequels were pretty underwhelming.
About time George hung up his hat.
When does the next installment come out?
I think in November.
I'm super excited!
