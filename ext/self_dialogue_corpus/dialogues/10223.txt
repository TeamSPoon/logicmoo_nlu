Who was the original actor in "The Mechanic"?
That was Charles Bronson.
Yes, he was a good actor.
His action films were really good when they came out.
Jason Statham took over the reboot.
There are a few more "Mechanic" movies now.
Looks like he has turned it into another franchise.
The first one was really good.
I agree, but the sequels haven't measured up to the first.
Once a character gets developed he needs a place to go in the sequel scripts.
