Have you seen Little Mermaid?
Yes, it is one of my favorite movies. I really like ariel.
She is so pretty! I wish I had hair like hers.
It is so long and red, it is pretty great.
I also like Open season!
That is a great one, perfect story about friendship.
I could watch it over and over.
It did have a great story line.
I hope they make a new one in the near future.
I would really be excited about seeing that!
