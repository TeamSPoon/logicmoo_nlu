So have you seen any new movies lately?
Yeah I saw Guardians of the Galaxy.
Oh really? I saw it last week.
I love it! What'd you think about it
I thought it was okay.
Just okay? What didn't you like about it?
I thought the story felt a bit rushed.
How so?
Well I thought that this movie should have been the third or fourth sequel rather than part two. They fought a planet, and a god.
Right, but I loved that we got a bit more back story.
Yeah, but the this reveal should have been at the end of the series, plus it would have given more time for the love story to develop.
I see what you''re saying, I think the series will keep being popular. If that was just an okay movie for you, what does an excellent movie look like?
I loved Logan, that was a great film.
Oh I loved Logan too, tell me about why you liked it?
Great setting and atmosphere, great character development, great pacing, great action, just perfect.
I loved that the action was so believable.
Yeah, that reminds me, did you see John Wick two?
Yeah I did, I give it 7/10 stars.
I agree, it felt a tad bit over the top.
No where near as good as the first John Wick!
