I just watched Zombie Land for the first time.
I love that genre.
The horror movie but also funny.
Have you ever seen Shaun of The Dead?
Is that one set in the UK?
Yes, funny guy fights zombies.
Is it scary and funny?
Yeah, a lot like Tucker Vs. The Evil dead.
I love that one!
You should check out Army of Darkness then.
