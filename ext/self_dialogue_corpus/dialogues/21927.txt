Do you know any good vampire movies I could watch?
There is always Twilight.
Who plays in that one?
Well, Kristen Stewart for one.
That has wolf people too right?
Yes, but they are skin walkers, not really wolves.
What is it about.
There is a vampire, he likes a teen, they have some issues.
I think I seen part of the last one.
Yes, they have this big battle and everyone dies.
They all die.
Well, not really the whole thing was actually just a vision, no one really dies.
What is the point of the movie then?
I do not think any one really knows.
Are there any other ones?
Interview with a Vampire was actually pretty good.
With Tom Cruise?
Yes, it is more realistic.
That one was based in the south right?
Yes, all the good vampire ones are.
