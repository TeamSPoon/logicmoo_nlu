Which team in the NFC East do you think will be the most improved?
The Eagles with their 2nd year QB and offseason additions.
Which team in the East you think will be worse than last year?
The Cowboys, I dont see them winning 13 games again.
You think Carson Wentz is going to help the eagles make the playoffs this year?
Yeah as long as he can stay healthy and the weapons around him are decent.
What about Dak Prescott? You think he will be as efficient as last season?
I think so, they wont be as good because people will have scouted for him but he should be good.
I think Elliott is going to dominate again, that offensive line is great.
I agree, that OLine is nasty and will continue to pave the way for Zeke.
Who is going to be better, Wentz or Prescott?
Wentz easily. He has more athleticism.
But what about last season? Wentz had more interceptions than touchdowns
When you have a makeshift OLine for most of the season and Dak has the best, you cant compare them just yet.
I can see where you coming from, the numbers are hard to miss though. Dak was better.
Yeah he was better but he also had better talent around him.
Dez and Zeke were really good so I guess what your saying makes some sense.
It will change this year, the eagles went out and got some weapons.
Maybe we will see some more identical stats this year based on that.
I sure hope so. Eagles fans sure are hoping that as well.
