Hey, have you ever listened to BBNG?
I do not think I have heard of them.
It stands for badbadnotgood.
That is a strange name.
Yea, they are a jazz trio, you should check them out.
I do not usually listen to jazz.
I think you will like it, they do a lot of interesting covers.
Like what?  I have not heard much jazz.
They have done a lot of rap covers.
You mean mainstream rap?
Some, and even some underground.  They covered DOOM, Wu Tang, ODB, Tribe Called Quest, and more.
Wow, that sounds amazing.
I can email you some recommendations to check out.
I would love that, send them over.
If you enjoy them, we should go see them live.
That sounds like fun.
Last time, they toured with Ghostface Killah and they did a lot of Wu Tang tracks.
That sounds right up my alley.
Anyways, I will send those over.  Give them a listen!
I will!  Thanks for the information.
