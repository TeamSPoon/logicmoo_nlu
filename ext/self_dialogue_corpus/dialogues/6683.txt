its been a while since i saw a disney movie
same here, man.
should we have a disney party?
sure, let's do it.
which one should we watch?
we have to watch lion king and beauty and the beast
what else?
we can watch cindarella and treasure planet.
treasure planet is so underrated
the soundtrack was great too
