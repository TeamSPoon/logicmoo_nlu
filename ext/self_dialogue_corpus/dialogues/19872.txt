Hey
Hi, want to talk about music?
Sure
Do you like country?
Always
I like Justin Moores new song
Which one?
Somebody else
That's a fun song
I love the beat in it
Yes the beat is really fun
There are so many new singers these days
Yes I still love the old
Like who?
I love John Michael montgomery and mark chestnut
I love mark chestnut
Me too, I used to have one of his cassette tapes.
Those were the days
He has so many good songs
And they are all really catchy
