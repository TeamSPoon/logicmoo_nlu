You'll never guess what I watched with the kids last night.
What?
The North Avenue Irregulars!
No! Really?
Yeah, I just had to share it with the kids. It was one of my favorite Disney movies growing up.
Mine, as well. I don't think anybody remembers it though.
I think you and I are the only ones!
Well, the only person people nowadays would know from the movie is Cloris Leachman.
That's true. I don't think anyone remembers Karen Valentine anymore.
Oh, she was one of my favorites back in the day, so pretty and cute. I think I'm going to have to watch the movie now!
