So, what teams do want to see in the next Super Bowl?
Ideally for me, it would be a Bears versus Packers Super Bowl.
I do love the rivalry there.
However, I do not see that happening.
Yeah I don't either.
Who would you like to see in the Super Bowl?
I would really like to see the Titans, or the Falcons again.
The Titans made some good pick ups in the draft. It's possible.
Yeah. I think they'll be strong, but not Super Bowl material.
True. There are other teams that look much stronger.
I just don't want to see the Patriots again.
I don't either. Unfortunately they're the top ranked team still in the power rankings.
It's not that they don't deserve it. I'm just tired of seeing them.
I have to agree with you there.
It's still highly possible that we see the Packers or the Cowboys go to the next Super Bowl.
That would be a nice change of pace.
They are both looking very strong this year.
I've always thought Aaron Rodgers was a huge talent.
He's one of the best for sure.
He just had a bit of misfortune last season that held the team back.
