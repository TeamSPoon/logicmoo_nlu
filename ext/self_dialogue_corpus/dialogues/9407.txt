Would you consider The Beastie Boys to be rap?
They were a rather unique act, largely hardcore punk early in their career, absolutely rap influenced in the middle and later, would say more hip hop.
Hip hop is a good way of putting them I would think, how did you like them?
They were good, but I'm more into things like Run DMC.
Wow that's a group I've not listened to in ages, classic stuff though
Classic as it gets, was a shame what happened to Jam Master Jay though.
Didn't he die sadly?
He did was shot and killed.
Wow that's awful, it seems sometimes the greats go too early.
Yeah it's a shame, but at least we have their stuff to enjoy. Speaking of which the track Sucker M.C.'s is calling my name.
