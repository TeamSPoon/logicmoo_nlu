Who do you think are some of the greatest guitarist out there.
I can say for sure that one was Eric Clapton.
Oh he was amazing.
He was in the Yardbirds and Cream.
Boy, Cream now that was a classic late 60's band.
Yardbirds too.
He had some good songs.
Yea, Layla,  Tears in Heaven and more.
He was a three time inductee into the Hall of Fame.
Wow three times, what an accomplishment.
He got a guitar for his thirteenth birthday.
He was also in the band John Mayall and the Bluesbreakers.
Oh and how about the band Derek and the Dominoes?
And Blind Faith?
Wow, he sure was in a lot of bands!!!
Sure was!
Boy the music back then was so much better than it is today.
It really is.
So much more talent.
And their talent never dies, it  stands the test of time.
