Hey, have you seen the Jungle Book?
Which one? The animated one or the newer, live-action one?
They're both amazing, but I meant the newer one.
Yes, I just watched it with my family last week!
What was your favorite part? Did you have a favorite character?
I thought the temple scene with all the monkeys, the orangutan, Mowgli, Baloo, and Bagheera!
Did you mean King Louie and where Baloo and Bagheera have to rescue Mowgli?
Yes! I couldn't remember the orangutan's name - Louie!
Did you find Shere Khan scary?
Yes! I managed to act cool about it, but my little brother screamed at least once. He's really scared of being eaten by lions or tigers.
