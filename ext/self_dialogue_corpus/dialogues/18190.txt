Do you like country music?
Yeah I do!  Do you?
Love it!  I'm going to see Florida Georgia Line in concert.
Oh, they're great in concert!  I saw them last summer.
I love their songs. "God, Your Mama, and Me" is my absolute favorite.
I like that one too.  What other country artists do you like?
Well you can't go wrong with the classics like Willie Nelson or George Strait.
I really prefer the more modern ones like Carrie Underwood or Keith Urban.
I like that song that Keith and Carrie do together.
"The Fighter?"
That's it!  So upbeat.  I can't help but dance!
I love Carrie Underwood.  Her music really speaks to me.
What song is your favorite?
I love "Temporary Home."
That is a great song.  Hard to believe she came all the way to where she is from American Idol.
I forgot she got her start from there.  She's one of only a few that have actually gone anywhere.
Kellie Pickler was on that show too.  Her music is pretty good.
She hasn't done anything lately.
No, but I still like her.  Her music is usually pretty peppy.
Yeah, it is!
