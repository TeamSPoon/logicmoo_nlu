Do you have a favorite type of music?
Yes, I really like jazz.
Jazz?  I like all types of music but I have never really listen to much Jazz.
Really?  This music is the best.
Why do you think so?
I like jazz music because it is all different and you can really get lost in the song.
That sounds interesting tell me more.
Well, when I listen to a really good jazz song it tells a story.
What do you mean?
You can listen to the words or the music and truly feel the emotions of the artist.
I really like music that I can connect to as well.
What music do you like.
I mostly listen to pop artists.  Whatever is played on the radio.
How do you connect to these songs?
Well, I listen to the beat and the lyrics.
I like pop music too, but I often can't relate to the lyrics of today's music.
Really?  Sometimes I feel the musical artists of today are speaking directly to me through their words.
Yeah, well maybe I need to listen closer, but it feels too much like work and not enjoyment.
We certainly have two extremely different musical tastes.
That's true, but it is clear we both enjoy music!
