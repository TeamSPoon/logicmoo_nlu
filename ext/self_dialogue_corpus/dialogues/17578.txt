Have you listened to Ed Sheeran's new album yet?
Are you talking about "Divide"?
Yes. I can't stop listening to it.
Me too! What's your favorite song on it?
I'm having trouble deciding between "Happier" and "Galway Girl."
I like those ones too!
Which song was your favorite?
I would have to say "Shape of You."
Oh, I really liked that one but I've heard it too many times on the radio and now I'm not as much of a fan.
So true- It seems to be on every time I'm in the car.
Are you going to his concert this summer?
No, the tickets were too expensive!
Yeah, they were outrageous.
Are you going?
I was going to go but I realized it was my mom's birthday so I had to sell the tickets.
Oh, that's such a bummer.
I know- I hear he's really good live.
I heard the same thing as well!
We should try and go to his concert the next time he comes to New York!
Definitely, that would be a lot of fun!
