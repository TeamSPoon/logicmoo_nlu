What are your favorite types of movies?
I like comedies, but I'm really into horror movies.
Me too! I love horror movies. What is your favorite horror movie?
I have a few favorites, but the Exorcist probably tops the list.
I've seen the Exorcist once when I was younger, I couldn't watch the whole thing.
I saw parts when I was younger too, but I watched the full movie for the first time when I was in my 20's.
What did you think about 'IT'?
The movie with the clown?
Yes! That is one of my favorites.
I don't know, I've never seen the movie.
There is a new version of the movie coming out.
I actually saw that! The clown looks very creepy.
Yes. I'm not sure it will be as good as the original but we should go see it.
Definitely! I should probably see the original one first so I can compare the two.
Yes I have the original one dvd. You can come over and watch it.
Ok. but don't tell me the ending!
I won't. It's a pretty long movie though so we will watch it when you have a lot of time.
ok. That sounds good. I can come over on Saturday.
Ok. maybe we can squeeze in exorcist.
We will see how scared I am after "IT" first.
