I saw 'Sanctum' recently. It's a thriller movie about an underwater cave diving expedition.
What did you think of it?
First of all, it was surprisingly realistic. I actually learned a little bit about scuba diving.
Does most of the film take place underwater?
Most of the film takes place in the cave the characters are exploring. The visuals in this film are just amazing.
I'm guessing there's more to the movie than just beautiful scenery.
Definitely. Not only does the tense and claustrophobic atmosphere immerse you in the movie, but so does the struggle for the characters' survival when disaster strikes.
I imagine the fact that something like that could happen in real life adds to the experience.
The movie is actually inspired by a real life cave diving expedition gone wrong.
I heard one of the stunt divers in the film died while cave diving.
