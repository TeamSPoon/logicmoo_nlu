So, have you seen Wonder Woman yet?
No, that's not my kind of flick.
I bet you mean that it's a comic book based film, and you think they're childish.
Yep. Although somebody dragged me to Dr. Strange, and I liked that.
That was good too. But Wonder Woman is even better.
Why? It seems like most of those flms are sort of simple-minded. The good are really good, the villains really evil, and the ending really happy.
It's more of a biography, of a feminist. I mean, it's a fantasy, sure, with strong action elements, but its values are excellent.
She's strong, and wise, and independent. But, let me guess, she's also beautiful, young, well-off and well-dressed.
Yeah. You want to watch ugly people? Living in misery?
Sure. Elephant Man. Midnight Cowboy.
You do know movies are supposed to be entertainment, right?
Sure. But I want to be entertained, not intellectually insulted.
Oh, I think you should go see it before you call it stupid.It got great reviews.
But I bet it won't in ten years.
So go see it now.
No. I'll wait.
It has a gorgeous romance, with a handsome male lead.
Hmm. What actor plays that part?
Chris Pine. From Princcess Diaries, you know?
Oh, okay. I guess I could stand to see it.
