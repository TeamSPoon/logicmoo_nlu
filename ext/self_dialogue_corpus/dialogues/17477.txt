Who's your favorite musician?
Wiz Khalifa.
Why Wiz Khalifa?
I didn't even know about him until he released See you again.
Oh the song for Brian.
That's right.
I liked that song.
It's my all time favorite now, just something about it brings all of my emotions to the surface and I feel better after.
I had that reaction the first time I listened to it.
It's so well put together.
The lyrics are perfect too.
It might be the best song tribute to one persons life ever.
That's debatable but what's not is it's a great one.
It makes me really feel like I knew and miss Brian.
I wonder how someone can create a masterpiece like this in such a short amount of time.
Some things just come out beautiful without needing to be polished.
I wonder what he thought while making the lyrics to the song.
it would have been neat to see that's for sure.
Let's watch FUrious 7 just so we can see that at the end again.
Let's do it tonight.
