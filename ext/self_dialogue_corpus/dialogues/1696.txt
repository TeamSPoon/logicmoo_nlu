What are your thoughts about the NFC West this year?
I am honestly not sure.
I mean, I think the regular teams are likely picks
I agree. Its sort of Seattle, then the others
That might not be a bad hting though
Good point, its nice to see parity
I think its interesting compared to the NBA
How so?
Well there are less "super" teams in football
I am not sure I agree..the Patriots? Seattle?
Well those are good examples but I'd agrue those are coach based.
Maybe you have a point there
I know it is the case with New Englad at aleast
I agree. Belicheck really is a genuis despite what others say
I just dont get how he can put it all together
No one does
Do you think they will repeat?
Who?
The Patriots
I am not sure...they have a good chance for sure.
