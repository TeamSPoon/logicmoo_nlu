Did you watch the trailer of 'Beauty and the Beast'?
Yes, the effects were pretty cool.
Emma Watson looked beautiful as ever.
Even, I am in complete awe of Dan Stevens' acting as The Prince/Beast.
Where is the plot based?
I think it's based in Pre-revolution France.
Cool! Are you planning to watch it?
Yes. Let's book the tickets.
It's releasing on 17th March. I have booked 2 tickets.
I am so excited already.
