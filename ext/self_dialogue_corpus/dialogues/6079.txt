Did you see any movies by Disney recently?
I saw High School Musical.
Oh really?
Yeah.
That movie is so old though. But the music is good I will admit.
Yeah it had been a long time since I watched so I wanted to watch again.
Who is your favorite in it?
I like Zach Efron and Vanessa Hudgens.
I like them too.
I also like Ashley Tisdale.
