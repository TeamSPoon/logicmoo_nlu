Could you change the radio station please.
Why? You don't like screamo music?
Not my thing.
What is your thing, elevator music?
Not quite...
Johnny Mathis?
Try again.
Ozzie Ozborne?
You are making me gag here...
The Monkeys?
Better than Ozzie, but not quite my sweet spot yet.
Give me a hint.
Occassionally, she is green.
Green? It can't be the Hulk, because he was definitely not a "she"...
Smartest thing you have said yet.
Oh, I know...the Witch in Wizard of Oz!
The actress has a name.
I don't know...Tina Green?
Idina Menzel...star of stage and screen!
Wait...she does Broadway!  That's worse than THE Monkeys!
