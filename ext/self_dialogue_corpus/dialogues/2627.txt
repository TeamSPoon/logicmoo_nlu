I saw you have quite an NFL collection in your house.
Yes, I have a lot of jerseys from the different teams.
How did you get them all?
Some are from sporting goods stores and others are from auctions.
Do you have autographed jerseys?
Yes, I won an autographed Franco Harris jersey.
Wow, that's incredible.
I also collect football cards.
How old is your most antique one?
I have some from the 1960's.
Really, I heard the Cowboys just joined the league then.
Yep, in 1960.
That's pretty cool.
I love my old NFL cards.
They are sweet.
What other collectibles do you enjoy?
Well, I like my Eagles coats the best.
The leather ones are really nice.
I love them too.
What will you get next?
