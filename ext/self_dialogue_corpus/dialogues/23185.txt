Lets talk Smokin Aces.
OMG, tht movie was intense.
Yes, it was. I am suprised it did not get more acclaim than it did.
No kidding! The filmography alone was superb. Totally realistic.
And a totally ensemble cast. Ryan Reynolds was fantastic in it.
Yes, and each character you got so sucked up in. I wish it had been a three hour movie just to get more of the characters.
For sure. Jeremy Pivin as Buddy Aces was perfect. He brought the drama!
His interaction with Common was unreal. I was gripped.
I really liked the whole "Unusual Suspects" twist to it also.
Yes, i know there was a couple of "Unusual Suspect" kinda movies, but Smokin Aces is one of the few that truly pull it off.
I agree. It kept you drawn in start to finish.
Oh, and Chris Pine as one of the Tremor Brothers was fantastic!
Yes, actually all three of them, Chris Pine, Kevin Durand and Maury Sterling were unbelieveable, stole the show!
Funny how all three of them never played such characters before.
I didn't even recoginize Maury Sterling. He must be a lot shorter in real life or they did some unreal camera angles.
True. The scent where Chris Pine kills Ben Affleck and he moves his jaw like he was talking had me in stitches
Yes, that was as crazy as when that kid on ridalin was doing the "Kung-Fu Boner" scene.
OMG, i was in tears laughing at that scene!
Me too. Its a fantastic movie.
I agree 100%!
