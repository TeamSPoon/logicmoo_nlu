Did you see Cars 3?
I caught it during a matinee.
I kind of thought it would be better than the second, but it's really not.
Yeah.  It's just kind of a bad franchise to be honest.
It just lacks the emotion of normal Pixar movies.
Nobody cares about talking cars.
Without Paul Newman, it also feels a bit incomplete.
Not to mention that the race car driving angle is played out.
At least the ride at Disneyland is cool.
I hope I can go someday!
