Hey are you going to watch the Halloween horror movie marathon this weekend?
I might, how recent are the movies they are showing?
Movies from the 80's till this past year.
Awesome I'm coming over to your place then this weekend.
I really hope they show Freddy vs Jason that movie was so badass!
Omg I know.That movie was a dream come true.
Even though it got a lot of bad reviews I absolutely loved the battle between Freddy and Jason.
Yes that was some of the best parts!
I just wish they would make a sequel to that movie already.
They totally should since it was foreshadowing that Freddy was still alive.
