What's the name of the Warthog from the Lion King again.
Simba?
No, that's the lion. The main character. The warthog.
I'm not sure. I know the meerkat is Timon, if that helps.
It doesn't. This has been driving me nuts all day.
Why don't you just google it?
I would, but my phone is out of battery.
Why don't you just use mine?
Thanks. It looks like it's Pumbaa.
Of course! Pumbaa!
