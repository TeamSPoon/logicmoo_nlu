Is Rock and Roll dieing?
Sure seems like it.
There don't seem to be any more truly Rock band coming out.
I know what you mean.
There is still Green Day.
Are they still making music?
Yeah, they just released an album.
Awesome! What's it called?
Revolution Radio.
Cool. I'll have to check it out.
You should, there are some really good tracks.
Do you have a favoite?
Bang Bang
Oh! I think I heard that on the radio.
Then how did you not know that there was a new album.
I just figured it was a track I had missed on a previous album.
I think that's why I like it.
Huh?
It's like a throw back to their original album.
I did think that was their best.
