Did you see the new Liev Schreiber movie?
No, what's it called?
Chuck.
What's it about?
It's about Chuck Wepner, who was a boxer that fought Mohammed Ali.
Oh that sounds exciting. Was it good?
I thought it was great! Schreiber was really great in the role, even though he does not look anything like the real boxer.
It must be difficult for Hollywood to find people that look like other people.
Yeah, that's true.
Is it as good as Rocky?
Definitely not, nothing can compete with Rocky, but it still has a good storyline.
I agree, Rocky is the best boxing movie.
Yes it is!
Who else is in the movie?
Naomi Watts and Elizabeth Moss.
When does it take place?
In the 70s when the fight happened.
It sounds like a good movie, I might have to check it out.
You should and tell me if you like it or not.
I will!
