Have you seen Bleed For this?
The boxer movie with Miles Teller right?
Yeah Miles plays Vinny "The Pazmanian Devil" Pazienza, a former boxer who is involved in a horrible car accident that critically injures his spine, but he has it in his head to recover and enter the ring again.
I remember watching the trailers and saying to myself, I have to see this!
It's really good and inspirational. Aaron Eckhart plays his trainer in the movie and you won't even recognize Aaron!
I love Aaron Eckhart. Ever since the Dark Knight. He used to always confuse me with Thomas Jane.
I know they look like twins at times. Almost interchangeable actors! Thomas Jane will always be the actor from guilty pleasure movies for me.
He was in Deep Blue Sea and the Punisher right?
Yeah, two of my favorite guilty pleasure movies to watch. He was also in a really good movie called Thanks For Not Smoking.
I'll have to check out Bleed For This for the story as well as Miles and Aaron's performances.
It's a very inspirational movie as you start off thinking Miles character is pretty arrogant before the crash, but you start to root for him to recover.
It sounds like a Rocky type movie to me, with the boxing and all.
It sort of is, but instead of working his way up from not having anything, as an underdog role in Bleed For This, he already is kind of at the top but loses it all and has to battle back.
Okay, this sounds like Rocky 3 then.
You have a point, it's more like Rocky 3, where Rocky has it all and starts to lose things making him realize he needs to go back to his roots.
I loved Rocky 3, Mr. T, Hulk Hogan, there was a lot of crazy in that movie.
We lost Mickey in Rocky 3, that was really sad.
That made me feel really sad to see Mickey die.
Watch Bleed For This, I think you'll really love it. Try to see if you can recognize Aaron Eckhart. He has a gut and is balding in here!
Okay, I have to see that for myself.
