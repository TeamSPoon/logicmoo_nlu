What super hero movie should I watch?
Have you seen Antman yet?
No, I haven't gotten around to it. Is it good?
Very good. It was hard to picture Paul Rudd as a superhero, but he actually is really great.
Yeah, he seems like such a normal guy, I can't picture him as being tough.
He really worked hard to get the role, he wanted to be believable.
I have seen him in some interviews and he definitely bulked up.
You're not kidding. He got so big they had to alter his costume.
No way!
Yes, his muscles were so big, they had to alter the suit so he could fit!
