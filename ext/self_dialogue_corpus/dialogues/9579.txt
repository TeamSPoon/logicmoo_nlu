What are some of your favorite rappers?
I like Kendrick Lamar.
Oh cool, what song do you like the best from him?
I like the song "i".
That is a very good song.
I know, but for some reason only the music video has a decent version of the song.
You don't like the traditional version?
Not so much. It lacks that depth and flavor.
Understandable. Well it was nice talking to you!
You too!
