Have you seen any good movies lately?
Just whatever the kids are watching!
Tell me about it.
Some of the new kids movies are actually pretty cute though.
Yeah, until you've seen them 500 times!
Agreed. My daughter won't stop watching Moana, so I can't say that's one I enjoy.
That's how my daughter was with Frozen, until Moana came out!
I still think Frozen is a cute movie.
Yeah, I do too.
It's good to have a Disney movie without a prince charming kind of person.
I'm all about teaching my daughter girl power!
Are your kids watching Over the Hedge?
Yes! That's my favorite. It's so cute.
Totally. The animal movies totally get me.
Me too. I loved Ice Age when it came out ages ago!
Yeah, animated movies were different before we had kids!
Agreed! Happy Feet was another one I loved.
Me too. But now my world is Moana.
Oh, I can recite all the lines from that movie!
Wanna get our daughters together for a playdate?
