Which of the Expendables movies was your favorite?
Oh man, I really like them. I love that throwback style.
I'm partial to the second.
Me too, it had so many giddy catchphrase moments.
What about the third?
It seemed a bit unnecessary.
Wait, which was the one with Stone Cold Steve Austin?
That's the original.
Ahh, thanks, it's been a while.
Not sure why they had him as being the big bodyguard. All things considered, he's not THAT big.
