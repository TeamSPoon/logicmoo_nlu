Have your kids watched the Lion King movie yet?
Yes they have.
Did they like it?
Yes, they loved the movie.  They especially love the music.
Overall it is a good movie, but I don't like the sad part where Mufasa dies.
I agree.  It is very hard for kids to understand that part of the movie.
We try to focus on the cute animals and music.  But my kids do get confused during the sad part.
I wish there weren't so many deaths in Disney movies.  Since they are supposed to be for kids.
At least it has a happy ending.
Yes that's true!
