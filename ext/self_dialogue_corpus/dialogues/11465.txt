Do you think that the White Album is the Beatles best album?
Actually, my favorite is Rubber Soul?
Really? Why?
I think they were at their peak during Rubber Soul. George was just getting into playing the sitar with Norwegian Wood and the folk influences made it a very grounded album.
Well, I agree that Norwegian Wood was amazing, but what else was on that album?
Michelle, Drive my Car, Nowhere Man, plus a bunch of others.
I love nowhere man. It always reminded me of Bob Dylan?
Lyrically, I can see that.
I still think The White Album was better.
Well, we don't have to choose. We can listen to them all.
