Did you see Victoria Beckham's new line at Target.
Yes, but I don't like it.
Why I think her line is cute and affordable.
To me it looks cheap and it doesn't look like she put much thought into the line.
Who is your favorite desinger
I love Tom Ford, but I can't afford his clothes.
Yeah, Tom Ford is ok, Jay-Z seems to love him, but I'm not into Tom Ford's clothes.
He make nice things, I also love Micheal Kors, I love his bags!
Who dresses better Rhianna or Beyonce?
Rhianna, because she takes more risks. She changes up her style all the time. Beyonce is hit or miss for me.
Who is your style Icon?
I like the way Michelle Obama dressed. She become my icon of the years she has so much style and class and she has nice skin to go with her outfits.
Do you shop at H&M?
Sometimes, but I am not crazy about their fashion, I actually like shopping at True Religion.
True Religion, jeans are not worth it in my opinion.
Why, I love their clothes True Religion is a cult fave!
DO you watch fashion shows? Does Project Runway still come on? Of love Tim Gunn!
I'm not sure, I do not watch fashion shows.
What are you wearing now, where did you get your outfit from?
I'm wearing a dress from Torrid, I like to shop there sometimes.
