Are you a fan of the Fast and Furious movies?
Oh, yeah! I love them.
Which one is your favorite?
I would say the first, but I also like Furious 7.
What's you're favorite scene?
Hard to say. One of my favorites is when they drive the semi backwards.
Oh, yeah! That's intense. Who is your favorite character?
I would say Dominic Toretto, played by Vin Diesel.
I don't mind that the series is not super realistic. I see the racing as more of a form of artistic expression in cinema.
I agree! It's a visual painting.
