Do you like horrir films?
I love them , one of my favorites is the 1st original nightmare on elm street
Are there any stars in the film?
Yes, Johnny depp was in the 1st one and he was really good
Why did you like that movie so much?
I like the story line, how if you go to sleep and Freddy comes to kill you if you don't wake up you can die.....its such a creative story
Do you have any other horror films that you like?
Oh yes, I also like the original Friday the 13th and Halloween with Jamie Lee Curtis
Did you get scared after you watch the movies?
I do, but it's more disturbing than anything else
