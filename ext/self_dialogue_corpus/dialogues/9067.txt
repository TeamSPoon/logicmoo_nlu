Do you think rock music is dying?
What do you mean?
You don't see any big rock acts anymore.
There are still big rock acts touring.
Yeah, but they are all bands from the 70s and 80s.
I guess that's true.
I can't even name you a big rock group from this decade.
I don't think I can either.
So do you think rock music is dying now?
Yeah, I guess it kind of is.
