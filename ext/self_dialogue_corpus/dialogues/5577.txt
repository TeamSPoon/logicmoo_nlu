Did you like the movie Wreck-It Ralph?
Yes, I loved it! Vanellope is so cute.
What did you think of King Candy?
I was so shocked! Who would have thought he was Turbo.
They're making a sequel.
Really? When does it come out?
Maybe 2018, I'm not sure.
I'm going to watch it for sure!
I hope it's just as good as the first one.
Me too!
