Are there any Disney movies that you didn't like?
I tried to watch Alice in Wonderland, but it was weird.
Yeah, I didn't even understand the birthday scene with the Mad Hatter.
Oh, you mean the unbirthday scene?
Yeah, see that didn't make sense to me.
What about the dancing cards?
Well, that song was catchy at least, not sure what they were supposed to be doing though.
I did kind of like the Cheshire Cat?
Wasn't he the one with the glowing eyes, that would disappear?
Yeah he was, he was creepy, but I still kind of liked him.
