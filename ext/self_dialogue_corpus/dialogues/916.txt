Who is the favorite to win the Super Bowl this year?
I haven't see, but I'm guessing the Patriots.
Yeah I'd bet that would be the most likely.
I think Dallas, Atlanta, and Oakland will be in the running too.
How about Oakland?  I like their QB, Carr.
He is really good.  Hopefully his broken leg is healed.
I forgot about that.  He broke it right before the playoffs.
Yes and Houston was having QB problems too.  What a bad game to watch.
It sure was.  I think Houston will be better this year now that Osweiler is gone.
He seemed like he'd be good, but I think he has confidence issues in the pocket.
I still can't believe Houston didn't want Romo.
That would've been a great fit for both of them.
Houston has a great defense and just neede and experience QB.
I know, but I think money was a problem.  Romo calling NFL games should be interesting.
I think he will do okay.  He did get a great job though.
He sure did.  He got in the booth with Jim Nantz.
Nantz is great. Like how he calls an NFL game.
Don't forget the Masters!
He does college basketball too, but I think he is best doign the NFL games.
Well he has Romo to carry now.  Hopefully they are a good pair.
