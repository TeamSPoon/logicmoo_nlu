My favorite Christmas movie is Miracle on 34th Street.
Oh that is a really good movie.
Don't you think that Natalie Wood was adorable in that movie?
Oh I do, she was really young, I wonder how she remembered all those lines?
I don't know, it is really amazing.
Edmund Gwenn who plays Santa really looks like a Santa.
He does. He plays the Macy's Santa.
That movie is so good, it has a great story line.
I just cannot believe that no one thought he was Santa.
Yea me either!
Maurenn O Hara played Natalie Woods characters mother.
Remember she did not believe he was Santa either.
I remember that.
But she did at the end.
Yes everyone did.
That movie came out in 1947.
There were so many great movies back then.
And great actors and actresses.
It was so much more glamorous back then.
It definitely was.
