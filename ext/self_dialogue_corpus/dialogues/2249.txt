Who do you think is the best quarterback ever?
It has to be Tom Brady, he has the most rings too.
Yea but he cheated.
He won another superbowl after inflategate, though.
That's true. Alright who is the number 2 quaterback?
I don't know, maybe Joe Montana?
I think Joe Montana was great under pressure and at orchestrating comebacks.
He had Jerry Rice to throw too, maybe too easy.
Okay, who is the number three quaterback?
I have to think about this, what do you think?
Probably Troy Aikman.
I hate the Cowboys. Can't agree.
Who do you think, then?
Has to be some older generation guy probably.
Maybe John Elway?
Yea he was always pretty awesome. And he got better as he got older which is amazing.
Peyton Manning is another really good choice.
He was really solid and dependable.
Overall I think Brady would beat all of them.
I think you're right.
