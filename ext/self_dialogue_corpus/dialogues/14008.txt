If you had to choose five all time favorite Lady Gaga songs what would they be?
They would be Bad Romance, Paparazzi, Born This Way, Perfect Illusion, and Monster. You?
I like Bad Romance, Judas, You and I, Marry The Night, and Alejandro.
Those are great too. You and I is really fun, but also romantic.
I agree. Why do you like Monster? I never got that one.
I think that it comes off as silly as first, but it could be deeper.
What do you mean?
I feel like it represents this type of guy who starts off as just a fun fling, but then ends up breaking your heart.
That makes sense. I'll give it another try.
You should. A lot of her songs are both relatable and empowering.
