Every seen the movie Happy Feet?
I am not sure, was it a dancing movie?
Well kind of.
With Zac Efron?
No, tha was High School Musical. This is about penguins.
Penguins don't dance.
In this movie this one does.
So it is about a dancing penguin?
Yup, sounds odd but it really was  great film.
How come?
The dancing was actually really sweet. The characters were well developed so yo cared what happened to them.
What did happen to them?
The classic man coming along screwing everything up for the animals.
Like what?
One scene I remember a bird has a soda plastic ring stuck around his neck because he thought it was food in the sea.
Sounds sad.
There was also the sruggle of his mom coming back in time.
Back from where?
The sea, the moms do everything in penguin world while the father holds the baby egg on their feet until they are born and big enough to survive.
I never knew that.
