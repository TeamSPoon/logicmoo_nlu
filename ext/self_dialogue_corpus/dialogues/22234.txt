Getting back to Annabelle 2.
Yeah?
How do they even know the spirit they were talking to was really their daughter?
I don't know. That trailer didn't tell me too much.
Could it have been  a demon or something that was tricking the family into allowing it into their lives that way it could mess up their lives?
It wouldn't have been her daughter. As the Warrrens said in The Conjuring, Annabelle was possessed by a demon.
Okay if Annabelle is possessed by a demon, is the  demon is controlling Annabelle (the daughter), asking for permission to become a physical entity.?
Maybe. Just maybe the girl IS in the doll, but since the new family moved in, the dead girl wants them gone so that she could have her parents all to herself!
I can buy that. That makes sense.
I'm not getting this though. I think I am thinking too hard about it.
This movie  tells the story behind the origin of the possessed Annabelle doll.
Oh so it is one of those origin movies?
Yep, I believe it is.
It is scheduled to be released in the United States on August 11, 2017.
The more we talk about it the less I think I will go see it when it first comes out.
Why do you say that?
I have a feeling this isn't going to be anything special. It is not going to be a good horror movie.
Yeah. When you do think about it, it is just a doll.
But don't let me stop you from going to see it.  Go and let me know if I should wait until it comes on cable.
I will just as soon as it hit theaters.
