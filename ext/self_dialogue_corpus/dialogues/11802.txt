What Beatles album do you like best?
I like Sergent Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
That is a strange title where did that come from?
They did it as an alter ego band I think.
What song do you like best on it?
I like With a Little Help from my Friends.
That one is good.
I also like When I'm Sixty-Four and Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds
They have many great songs.
Yes but this album is my favorite.
