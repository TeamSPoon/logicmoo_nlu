Did you see that movie Man Up?
No, what kind of movie was it?
It was a romantic comedy.
Oh, I love those.  I must have missed that one!
Well, I would definitely suggest you see it?
Why do you say that?  Was it that good?
Oh yea.  It's easily one of the best romantic comedies of the last few years!
What made it sound good?
Everything!  The acting, the plot, the soundtrack were all stellar!
It does sound good!  Can you tell me more about the plot.
Sure, it's a blind date gone wrong.
Can you elaborate?
Well, I don't want to give too much away.  I will say that the wrong people ending up going out on this date.
Sounds like an interesting premise for sure.
It is!  As I said, the soundtrack is great too.
Are there any songs in it that I might have heard?
Yes, a song called "What Time Do You Call This".
I've never heard it.  Who is it by?
It's by the band Elbow.
Oh, I've heard of them!  I'm certainly going to rent this!
