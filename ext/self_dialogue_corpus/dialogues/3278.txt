I wasn't too thrilled with the movie we watched last night.
Which one was it?
The horror film, Ghost Ship.
Not sure if I saw that one.
It was okay, but I wouldn't tell anyone to watch it.
That bad.
Well it had it's moments. Like when a cord came down across deck and cut people in half.
Sounds a little gory.
Yeah, a little, but other than that, nothing to brag about.
Guess that's why I don't know that movie.
