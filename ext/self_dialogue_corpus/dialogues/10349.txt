Do you like action movies?
I love action movies.  Especially the 90's etc.
I loved action movies with Arnold, Stallion, Van Damn, and Segal.
What about Blade, with Wesley Snips?
Those were awesome movies.  He kicked ass in them.
I also am a big fan of Jason Stathem, Jet Lee, Jackie Chan, etc.
Good call, those guys are great.  I love Stathem in the last Fast and Furious movie.
He was funny in it and kicked the hell out of everyone.
The Rock is one of my favorite all time action heroes.
He was good in the fast and furious movies, Central Intelligence, etc.
