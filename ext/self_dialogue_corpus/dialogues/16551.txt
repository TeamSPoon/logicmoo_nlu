They have 3 solid albums, a few that were pre-popularity. and one collaboration with touche amore.
Thats awesome! Whats your favorite album.
I really like wildlife. It has so much emotion to it.
Sweet. Id love to take a listen.
Ok. We can either use youtube or my record player.
Lets try the record player.
I love the song king park, it's number 9.
Wow, I am loving them so far. Im excited to hear that one.
Yeah, they have a 3rd album called rooms of the house. They recorded the entire thing in a cabin.
Thats different. Why would they do that?
They wanted to test out different sounds.
Thats so cool.
I have the DVD from when they recorded that album, as well as the limited edition pink record.
That's awesome!! Could I see it?
Yeah. It was difficult to find. They only made 500 copies.
Wow, can we listen to it? Thank you so much for introducing me to new music.
