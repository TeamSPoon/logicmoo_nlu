so when am i getting my money
sorry mate, unfailingly by nextweek
no worries, but that means that linkin park album remains with me for another week
hahaha you seem to be loving the album, that wasn't the deal
of course i am ,i wouldn't even mind swap the album for the money you owe
no way , not that album, that's an autographed copy,way worth more than i owe.
i know, just kidding mate, but i'm really getting to love soft rock after listening to the linkin park album
you should listen to the band MGMT as well and maybe you'll understand why i'm so obsessed with rock music
oh no , i am not that obsessed with it like you ,who knows, maybe its linkin park i like and not really general rock music
you actually don'y even have any genre you a complete fan of,i have gone through your playlist and you just have all random songs from all genre, good for you though, i'm all rock hahaha
i love anything that sound good to my hear.
good for you mate,for me i strictly listen to rock music, always put me in the mood i love to be.
anything goes for me,also depend on my mood and i do have every song i would listen to in what ever mood i'm in
so what genre of music would you say you are more connected to
i would say soul music
oh those sound really boring to me
its because you are so obsessed with rock music that you don't experiment with other genre
no way, my all rock playlist means i don't really miss much on other genre.
so aside rock what genre would you say you might slightly lean to
none mate, sorry to disappoint you.hahaha
