I heard this song on the radio is called Gold by kiiara
Okay what about it
Swear I couldn't understand any of the word she was saying
So did you look up the lyrics
Of course I look the lyrics up but even the lyrics doesn't match what she says
I don't know some artists just have that unique voice
Yeah well her voice isn't unique she just rambling on there
Do you got your iPod on you I want to hear the song
No I don't have my iPod with me but I have my phone here I'll play it for you
Oh wow you really can't understand what she's saying
And look this is what the lyrics says
Roof is falling Let Me Love You Let Me Love You
Yeah but don't let sound like she's sayingâ€‹ Rufus or something
Wow you fry it does sound like she's seen Rufus like a dog's name
So funny how artist is can come out nowadays with a song and say absolutely nothing
I know right they say nothing but make millions of dollars
Let me make a song and say nothing to make millions
You got to be famous first and actually come out with some good songs
Just like everybody get lazy and something
I got lazy and their career and decided just to makec rap music
