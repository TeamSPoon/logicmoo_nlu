Who is your favorite star wars character
I would have to say Darth Vader
Why? But he's the villain!
His complex story really interests me
What do you mean by complex
I mean think about it, we start from Episode 1 and see how young Anakin Skywalker grows up and develops as a character
I see
I just like seeing a character go from zero to villian because the story is interesting
Who is your least favorite then?
Jar Jar, no doubt
