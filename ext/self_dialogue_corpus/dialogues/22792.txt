What's up? Have you seen the latest xman movie?
Which one? Logan?
Oh is that out now? I meant apocalypse.
Oh. Well yeah, I saw apocalypse but I think Logan is out now.
What did you think about apocalypse?
I liked it but i thought that first class was better
That's interesting, I liked days of future past best so far
That one was pretty good. What do you think they will do next with the series?
Well, I'm pretty sure Deadpool has places to go but I feel like wolverine and his storyline is dying down
That's true. Speaking of, did you ever see Deadpool? What did you think?
I thought it was hilarious, even though it was a bit dirty
Yeah, I wasn't sure how it fit into the Wolverine back story when striker makes the "deadpool" that is all the mutants combined.
I always thought it was interesting how the only way to kill all the mutants was to make something with all the mutants capabilities.
Thats so true, its like, why not just let mutants be?
I guess its hard when theres mutants like Magneto out there.
Yeah, I wonder what happened differently after the president was saved by mutants.
I always wondered that. I guess apocalypse has some of the answers
Yes, but not many, it goes into its own story more
Thats right, well we should go see the next one that comes out together
Sounds great!
