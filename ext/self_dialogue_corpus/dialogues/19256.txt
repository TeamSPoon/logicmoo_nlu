What is a song you find underrated?
I would say Cliffs of Dover.
I don't think I know that song.
It's a strange song.
How do the lyrics go?
There are no lyrics.
So what kind of song is it?
It's Eric Johnson just shredding on the guitar.
That sounds like a crazy song.
It was in the Guitar Hero video games.
I found a lot of good music from those games.
I also love Black Magic Woman.
That is a jam.
Carlos Santana has had a lot of great songs.
It's sad Carlos is most known for that song with the Matchbox 20 guy.
That was a huge hit song.
Matchbox 20 whatever happened to those guys?
They are still around but mostly do solo stuff.
I was never much of a Matchbox 20 fan.
I like a few of their songs but I don't really care about them either.
