So who is going to win the finals?
The Warriors.
Who do you think they  will win over?
The Cavs.
Man that would be a great series.
Yeah, I'm really rooting for that.
Plus it would be the first back to back to back finals in NBA history.
Yeah, I care less about that but it would be fun.
Yeah, Lebron vs Durant would be so good to watch.
Yeah and Kyrie vs Steph.  I can barely wait.
Hopefully everyone stays healthy for that.
Well if the Cavs and Warriors keeps sweeping they will have plenty of rest.
Yeah that should keep them healthy.
Which is better for all fans.
Yeah I wonder if Draymond could do anything to get suspended this year?
It would have to be really terrible because I bet the league does not want that storyline again.
Yeah plenty of people think that the Warriors would have won without his suspension.
I am one of those people.
I could see that.
Yes it totally swung the finals.
