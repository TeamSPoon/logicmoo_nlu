So do you like Elton John.
Of course I do.  Who wouldn't like Elton?
He is a great performer.  So many hits.
Like Benny and the Jets.
Or Rocket Man.
Plus he's a great piano man.  He puts on a pretty good show.
Yeah, I would have liked to see him and Billy Joel go out together.
Easily the best two piano men of our time.
They are both just tops.
I wonder if they'll ever go out again?
Maybe, hey you know what was a good Elton John son?  Tiny dancer.
Yes, that was really good.
He just has one of the best voices you could ever hear.
Yeah, they don't make them like that anymore.
Him and Billy Joel were kind of like the fathers of today's alternative.
I see that.  Like to Jason Mraz and Amos Lee.
Exactly.  Just look at Goodbye Yellow Brick Road from Elton.
Or of course Piano Man from Billy.
My life form Billy as well.
My favorite song from either of the two.  Only the good die young.
