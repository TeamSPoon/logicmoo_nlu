What do you think about actors like Jim Carrey and Eddie Murphy kind of stopping being good?
It bums me out honestly, Bruce Almighty was Jim Carrey's last real good movie.
Wow has it been that long since he made a good film?
It really has, I guess Yes, Man can be considered alright but it's just Liar Liar again.
True, it's a shame to see old comedians fall low.
Although I think he was pretty good in Kickass.
Oh wow I forgot he was in that.
Yeah him and Nicolas Cage had great roles in those films.
That's something nice to think about, actors who show up in unexpected ways.
Oh like Tom Cruise in Tropic Thunder?
Oh my god I think that's one of the best examples.
Right, I couldn't believe it was him when someone told me.
Oh wait you didn't realize off the bat it was him?
Nope, I was in the theater and thought the character was great and had no idea.
That's such a great surprise then.
Indeed it is, one of the highlights of a great movie.
Yeah I think Tropic Thunder is a classic comedy, Stiller and company did a great job.
They did, Robert Downey Jr. played a great part.
Oh I almost forgot about his black face role, hilarious.
Yeah pushed the right buttons while towing a fine line.
