Who is your favorite Disney Princess?
It is hard for me to choose but I think I like Belle the best. And you?
I like Ariel. I think it is the songs in The Little Mermaid that I like best.
They do get stuck in your head!
Yes, but I think that it was is great about Disney movies. The songs!
With the new Beauty and The Beast movie out I am definately hearing those songs floating around again.
Why do like Belle?
She seems content with very little. Just makes herself happy. Why do you like Ariel?
She is also very happy with very little, she collects trash!
I guess they are very similar!
