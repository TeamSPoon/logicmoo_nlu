Have you seen memento?
Great film, what are your thoughts?
I thought it was a very ingenious film. I though the way they dealt with the timeline so interesting.
It was and at the time very original and new.
Guy Pearce also was great in this film. He really made it  work for me.
Guy Pearce was definitely showing his star power in this role. So good.
Joe Pantoliano is also a great character in this film, he is such a good bad guy.
Agreed he is also great in the matrix.
Yes I also enjoyed the matrix and his performance in it as well as the fugitive and others.
He is a good actor, less of a home known name but such a recognizable face.
