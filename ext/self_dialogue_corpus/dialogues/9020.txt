Do you remember in Junior High what song everyone played on the Juke Box at lunch?
I sure do. Hot Blooded.
Everyone went ot get a slice of pizza and listen to music.
Foreigner was played a lot on that Juke Box.
Then it was Double Vision.
What was the next song we played too much?
Juke Box Hero.
Foreigner was a big part of our school years.
Yes, and those songs are still good now.
Some rock songs always will be.
