I just watched brave last week.
That was a good emotional movie
I didnt like it at first because the girl was being brat
She was, but it had a great ending.
It was so sweet
Definitely a great family movie
Yes it has good lessons for the kids
My kids loved it
So did mine
I wonder if they will come out with another one
