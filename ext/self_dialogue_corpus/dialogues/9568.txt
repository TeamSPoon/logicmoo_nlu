Who all has Dr. Dre made famous?
I think two of the most prominent people are Eminem and Kendrick Lamar.
Oh, I didn't realize he helped Kendrick Lamar!
Yeah, they're both from Compton and Dr. Dre put Kendrick on early.
Interesting. He seems to have an ear for great artists.
Yeah, those are two of the most iconic rappers of the past twenty years.
It's interesting that both of them have staked a good deal of independence from Dre. They don't overuse features or production by him.
Yeah, I think that was important for both of them, to not be seen as leaning too heavily on Dre.
Right. YG, another Compton rapper has this line about being the only rapper to make it out of the West without Dre, and while Dre helped Kendrick, I think it's kind of unfair to imply that he wouldn't have done it without Dre.
Right, it's not as if Dre was the only one who was recognizing Kendrick.
