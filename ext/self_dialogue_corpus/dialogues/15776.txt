Are you a fan of Luke Bryan?
Actually, I am. I like country music pretty well.
He's my favorite country singer! Favorite Luke song?
"Do I".
That one's sad, but it is very beautiful and I do love it!
Yeah, what's your favorite Luke song?
Mine is "Home Alone Tonight".
The one that he sings with the girl from Little Big Town?
Yeah, Karen Fairchild's her name! It's awesome!
That one is pretty amazing.
I just love Luke, my dream is to meet him at a concert!
I do like Luke, but I'm more into Brantley Gilbert.
Yeah, he's pretty awesome too! I like his song "Bottoms Up".
Oh yes, that's my favorite!
I would love to meet him as well!
Me too. We should totally go to a Luke and Brantley concert!
Oh my gosh that would be totally cool!
Yes it would! Both of our faves at a concert together!
I am such a big fan of country music, aren't you?
Ditto!
