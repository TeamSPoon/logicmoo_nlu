What did you think of the movie "Twister"?
Was that the movie with Bill Paxton and Helen Hunt?
Yes, that's the one.
I thought that movie was scary.
Really?  I thought the movie was funny and informative.
Informative?  How so?
Well, I'm sure there were liberties taken, but that's close to how I imagine storm chasers work.  The humor was what really sold me on the film, tough.
What was your favorite comedic moment?
There were so many...I can pull so many one liners from the dialogue.  "Rabbit is good, rabbit is wise!" "Cow? - Same cow!"
Wasn't the character of Rabbit played by the guy who played Cameron in Ferris Bueller?
Yes!  Alan is awesome.  But, it's also interesting that Twister starred  Phillip Seymore Hoffman.
Did it really?
Yes, that was one of his first big roles in Hollywood.
How many times have you seen Twister?
At least twenty times.
Wow!  Who else was in that movie?
Carey Ewles, the guy who played Wesley in "the Princess Bride" was the rival storm chaser.
I heard that they used a lot of real footage in the movie, is that true?
As I understood it, they were actually filming on location in Kansas when a small tornado touched down so they sent the crew to get some B Roll footage.
That's realy cool.
