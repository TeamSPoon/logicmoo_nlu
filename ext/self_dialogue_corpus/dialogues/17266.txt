So, are you a music lover?
That depends on what you mean by "music lover"
I mean, do you like to listen to music?
I don't have a lot of time for it.
Not to sound rude, but you can listen to music and do other things at the same time, right?
I really can't....I like to play it loud, shut my eyes and get taken up in it
That's ideal, really, but I wonder if you are missing out by having "less than perfect" circumstances to listen to music ...
what do you mean?
I love your idea and it IS ideal, but what about just playing music while you are doing other things?
i have a one year old baby.  How would that work?
I know that when i had a small baby, the baby definitely liked certain kinds of music, like music with a heavy base.
what happened?
she would actually nod her head in time with the music.  it was so cool to watch. her father played guitar and she would move with that also
i'm thinking of trying that out.  what do you think i should start with?
well, depending on the time of day, like nap time, a mid range classical cut would be good. something that had enough action to grab her attention and then slowing down
why that kind?
It would help the baby to nap!
Oh, i never really thought of these ideas
they specifically make CDs of different "moods" to play for babies; wake them up, put them to sleep, that sort of thing
this is brilliant...I'm going to do this!
