I noticed the other day that there was a Harry Potter marathon on, I got sucked into Goblet of Fire.
Ooo, I loved that one!
I love all the challenges that the kids do.
Which was your favorite?
I like the scene in the lake. It looks so cool with everyone on the stands watching.
Me too. I really like the task with the dragons.
Ooo, that's a good one too! I want a baby dragon.
Did you notice who Cedric Diggory is? It's the guy from Twilight.
I forgot about that. I loved his character in Harry Potter, he acted it really well.
Yes, I was really sad when he died.
