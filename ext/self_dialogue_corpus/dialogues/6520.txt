Do you remember what that movie was called where the family gets shipwrecked on an island and builds a really cool treehouse?
I think you mean Swiss Family Robinson.
Yes. It's a really old movie but I thought it was fun to watch how the family worked together to make the best of the situation.
The carnival day where they all race on exotic animals they've found on the island was hilarious.
But remember that also was the day the pirates landed and they had to defend their home.
That was kind of scary but also very exciting.
Have you heard if Disney is going to do a re-make of Swiss Family Robinson?
There's been quite a bit of talk about that but nothing definitive.
Where had the Robinson family originally been traveling to?
New Guinea.
