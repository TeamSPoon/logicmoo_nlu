Who do you think was the better Packers Quarterback Brett Favre or Aaron Rogers.
I'd take Favre for the longevity and being an Iron Man.
He was a great quarterback but he had his weaknesses.
He was prone to throw many interceptions.
But he always made the game interesting.
And he does have Super Bowl victories.
I personally think Rogers is a better quarterback.
His accuracy is deadly and he has mobility too.
I think I would take Rogers if they both played at the same time.
Farve is the Iron Man but Rogers in just unstoppable.
Having Rogers on the team turns that team into a different team.
When he gets hurt they usually miss the playoffs.
But when he is in they always go.
They need to get him more help on defense.
Yes, with defense this becomes a Super Bowl team.
But they are always in it as long as they have Rogers.
Yes, Rogers alone keeps them very competitive and in the playoffs.
Unfortunately they often have bad defenses.
Yes it just hasn't been a priority.
Well teams do what they can with the salary cap and Rogers demands the big bucks.
