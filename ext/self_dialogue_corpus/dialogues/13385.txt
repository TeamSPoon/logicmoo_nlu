Who is your favorite Star Wars character?
Mine would have to be Darth Vader.
Why is that? What is good about him?
Well, it depends on your definition of good. Darth Vader did what he thought was right.
He killed so many innocent people though.
That is true, but his girlfriend was killed.
Interesting. I guess he is good at what he does.
Indeed. He is a very strong character who gets what he needs.
I might go back and re watch the series and pay more attention now.
I would. It is a good way to understand a character better.
