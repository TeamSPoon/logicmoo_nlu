You got any suggestions for new underground rappers for me to check out?
Rarri is a new rapper that I like.
Which songs should I listen to?
I liked "What Dey Seem", and  "2OUTH2ID3".
Alright cool. Who else do you suggest?
Warhol.ss, his song "Speed Racer" is great, the video is amazing too.
I know Warhol, but i haven't listened to a lot of his stuff.
Yeah, he did a song with Famous Dex not too long ago.
Alright cool, I'll check these guys out.
Nice, let me know what you think.
