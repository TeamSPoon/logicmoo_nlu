What is your favorite Disney film?
Mary Poppins for sure.
That was a good one.
I heard they're going to do a remake.
Oh, yeah? I wonder who they'll get to play Bert.
They certainly can't top Dick VanDyke.
That's for sure.
Or Julie Andrews for that matter.
Everyone in the original was great.
I hope they don't foul it up.
