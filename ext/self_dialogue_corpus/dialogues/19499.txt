I saw Bon Jovi in concert five times.
That many. Are you crazy?
That was a great show. He had so many hits.
That is true.
It all started with Runaway back in the 80's.
That was one of the first videos on MTV.
Yeah, back when they actually played music.
I know. Now it's like all reality TV shows.
The music videos made that channel and they forgot about music.
True.
So did you ever see Bon Jovi in concert?
No, I never got to go.
Too bad. He still tours.
Maybe if he comes around I'll go with you.
Sounds good. His new music is great too.
Yes it is. Didn't he just have a new song out?
Yes. We Don't Run.
He also does a lot to help poverty.
He gives free food away in a retsaurant as long as people are willing to do one odd job for them.
That's great.
