What did you think of attack of the clones?
I thought it was ok, better than Phantom Menace but still near the bottom of the list.
Yeah, the only real highlights were count Dukoo and Yoda fighting it out.
That's not entirely fair.  Samuel L Jackson had a good fight scene.
I guess you're right.  Seeing all those Jedi in a major battle was different as well.
Let's just try to forget the I hate sand comment.
Agreed, I try to remember it more for the beginning of the emergence of Darth Vader.
Like when he took out all those sand people.
And threw a bit of a fit saying he should decide who wins and dies.
I almost forgot the relationship between him and Obi Wan, that was pretty good too.
