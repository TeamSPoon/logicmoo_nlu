did you like pirates of the carribbean?
i watched a couple of them
you did not watch the newest one?
i just kinda lost interest
i did the same.
johnny depp is the main attraction
but now i think he is just doing it for the money
he went broke recently too
i wonder what he spends his money on
he is an A list celebrity too.
his role in the movies were really cool
he plays such a good character as jack
a lot of people were introduced to johnny because of the movies
i am not gonna lie but im one of those people
serious?
then i watched edward and his other movies
yeah, he had a bunch of good movies
pirates was just okay though
storyline could be better
that is true
