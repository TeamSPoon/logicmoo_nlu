Hey can you help me with movies?
sure. what do you want to know?
so basically I am looking for some good action movie to watch.
okay. does it have to be new or any will do?
I guess any will do, though it should be something that I haven't watched before.
okay so in general how many actions movies have you seen so far?
I guess not many. I don't get much time to watch movies.
oh. so how come you have time right now?
it's my summer vacation! now tell me a good movie!
okay sure. have you seen minority report?
I have heard that name before. But I am not sure if I have seen it.
it's action plus sci fi. Starring tom cruise
Oh yes! I have seen that one!
okay so let me guess another name.
sure, tell me some awesome movie!
okay have you seen expandable series? it is totally 100% action.
no I haven't seen that one.  You mean all action no story?
yes, kind of no story, but definitely lots of action.
I guess I can try that kind of movie.
sure. and if you like the first part, there are two more expandable movies. enjoy!
