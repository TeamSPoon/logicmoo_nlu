Have you ever been to an NFL game?
No but I really want to go. It is just so expensive!
Last year Jets and Dolphins tickets were going for $10.
Okay, let me rephrase. It is expensive to see a team I care about.
Aren't you a Pats fan?
Yes. Very much so.
Well, I guess you will never be finding cheap tickets then.
No and that's the problem. But it's okay. I watch on TV as much as I can.
I can't imagine you see a lot of games in your area.
It is hit or miss. I got a lot last year.
Well, at least you have post season every year.
It's not a given, but yes it's been pretty good lately.
Lately? When is the last time the Pats haven't the your division?
I think it was in 2008.
That is crazy! And wasn't that the year Brady was hurt?
Yes, and they still had a great record, but they lost the tiebreaker I think.
Since Brady started, haven't the Pats almost won all the division titles?
Every year except for 2002 and the year he was hurt.
As much as I hate to admit it, that is really impressive.
I know. It makes being a fan kind of easy.
