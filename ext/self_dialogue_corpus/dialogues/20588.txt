Have you seen the movie, The girl on The Train?
I have not seen it yet.
It is very good, and intense.
Who is in it?
One of my favorite actresses, Emily Blunt.
What is it about?
It is about a girl riding a train every day and watching people along the train ride?
When it is playing again, and where?
It is showing at 2:00 at our theater at the mall.
Do you want to go watch it with me?
Sure. I could watch it again, because it was so goo.
Okay. Do you want to meet at the theater?
We could ride together or meet there. It's up to you.
I think it would be fun to have dinner together before the movie, so let's ride together.
What time do you what time to pick you up?
How about at 12:30 so we have enough time to eat.
That sounds good. Where do you want to eat.
Applebees, and Texas Roadhouse are close by.
Okay how does Applebees sound, then?
Applebees sounds great!
