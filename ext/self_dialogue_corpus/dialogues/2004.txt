dude. patriots got an easy schedule this season.
yeah? who they got?
they play the chiefs in week one, saints week two, and houston week three.
okay, that sounds like three and zero.
then they got carolina, tampa bay, jets, then the falcons.
another four wins.
then they got the chargers, denver, and then oakland.
sounds like they could start off at ten and oh.
i know right.
but dude, i can't stand the patriots.
naw. you just hate because all they do is win.
i mean like give someone else a chance.
everybody does have a chance. right now everyone is undefeated.
yeah, a thirty two team tie for first place.
man you stupid.
i know right.
who you like this season?
i don't know really. i always root for my eagles though.
that goes without saying. do you think they will make some noise?
i hope so. they done missed the playoffs like two straight seasons.
