I can't wait for the new Tool album.
Me either.  Honestly, I'm not sure it's anything more than a rumor.
You've got to be kidding.  A band with that kind of following would be foolish to turn down an opportunity like this.
The suspense over a potential new album is quite high.
It is.  They could probably charge triple the cost and still go multi-platinum.
Definitely.  I hope they do make a new album.
I have no doubt they will and I hope it's great.
Me too, but I wasn't fully impressed by their last album 10,000 Days.
Why not?
It just didn't feel as epic as Lateralus or Aenima.  It was good though, just not epic.
I guess you're right.  It might be hard to beat really good songs from Aenima, like Pushit.
It will probably be hard to top the overall quality of an album like you find in Lateralus too.
They've got their work cut out for them then.
And the anticipation of their music is insane, rumors are flying around everywhere.
I've heard a few of them, covering everything from immediate release to not going to happen.
I've heard those too, but I'm sure they're going to release a quality album when it's ready.
The majority of their previous music has been composed quite well so I'm sure we can expect more of the same.
It's just hard to get through the rumors when the band is already so vague in everything they do.
That's another thing I like about them.  It's more about the music than their image.
I agree.  No pictures of the band, no interviews, just quality composition and contributing artwork.
