Steelers are gonna win it all this year!
They'd better, Ben ain't getting any younger.
I think he's got one more in him, just like Bettis.
I miss Jerome Bettis.
I miss Terry Bradshaw.
Those were the days!
Swann and Stallworth were the greatest.
I think both of them are in the Hall of Fame.
Mean Joe Greene was awesome too.
Do you remember his Coke commercial?
Yes! And Jack Lambert was a force!
The steel curtain was dominant.
Neil O'Donnell years were fun too.
Yes, we still have the most Superbowl rings.
What's your favorite Steelers game.
It's a loss actually, but it's funny.
What is that?
The Thanksgiving coin toss loss game to the Lions.
Oh my god I remember that!
Jerome's facial expression is priceless.
