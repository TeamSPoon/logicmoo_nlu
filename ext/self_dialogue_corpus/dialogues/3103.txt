Okay, so I don't really understand this football stuff at all.
What don't you understand?
Well, I want to be able to enjoy NFL games when we watch them. But I don't get the basic rules.
Like, about what down it is?
Yeah. What's a down?
Oh wow. Okay. Back to basics then.
So what is it?
A down is like a play. If you play four times without getting 10 yards forward, the other team gets the ball.
Okay. That makes sense.
And it resets if you move forward 10 or more yards.
I can understand that.
Anything else?
How do you win?
You score the most points.
How do you score points?
Well, you either get a touchdown, or through a kick.
Which is worth more?
A touchdown.
I guess I've got a lot to figure out.
I bet the NFL sells a rulebook!
