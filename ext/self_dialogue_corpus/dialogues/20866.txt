Are you excited to watch the upcoming star wars film?
Yeah what's it called? The Last Jedi?
Yeah that's the one, what do you think?
I hope it has more original content than force awakens.
Sure; I'm sure it will.
Because Force Awakens was almost the same as A new hope
That's what everyone says.
I know they did it to have the same kind of story for a new generation.
But I agree they could have put more original content.
What would be your favorite star wars film then?
Empire strikes back for sure.
Not return of the jedi?
Nah, Empire had a lot more dark undertones and a uncertain ending.
Don't forget about the introduction of Yoda
Yeah a classic character was established after seeing him.
And the scenes in Cloud City.
Where Han Solo gets stuck into carbonite.
And the snow battles.
SO many classic scenes.
The AT-AT has to be my favorite vehicle.
