I was at a bar last night and guess what song came on?
I have no idea.
Peruvian Cocaine.
You mean the Immortal Technique song?
Yea, I did not believe it at first.
I can not imagine hearing a song like that in public.
Yea it was quite shocking to me too but no one else seemed to notice.
Did they play any other songs?
They had a playlist on so I only heard that one.
What other songs were they playing?
All kinds of different underground hip hop.
That sounds awesome, where is this place?
It just opened down the street.
You should show me the spot next time.
They even played some Living Legends.
That is just awesome.
Also got some Heiroglyphics and old Wu Tang.
This place sounds exactly like my kind of spot.
Anyways, see you later this week.
Take care, see you then.
