Did you ever see Elton John in concert?
No I never did.
I saw him in 1977. He came up on the stage sitting at a piano that came up through the floor.
Wow, amazing. I know he is a showman.
Yes and he was a lot more of one then.
Very flamboyant.
What are some of your favorite Elton John Songs?
I loved many of them on his album Tumbleweed Connection. My favorite was Burn Down the Mission.
How about the song Yellow Brick Road?
It's Ok, I liked Daniels Song Better. And Your Song.
Did you know he sang Can you Feel the Love tonight from the Lion King?
Yes I knew That.
He was a good friend of Princess Diana as well.
His music has spanned decades! His first album came out in 1969.
And he has had a lot of them ever since.
He certainly puts on a good show, I have seen him on tv but never in person.
Yes he does.
Maybe we can go see him sometime?
That is a great idea.
I wonder if he still goes on tour.
