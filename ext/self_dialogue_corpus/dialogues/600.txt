Hey, which team is your favorite NFL team?
The Seattle Seahawks.  I have been a fan since childhood.
Do you think the Seahawks can win the Super Bowl this year?
I definitely think they can if they stay healthy.
My favorite team is the Patriots.
Yuck, I hate the Patriots.
I know, lots of people do, but I love that they are always good.
Yeah, I guess.  How long do you think Tom Brady can continue to play at a high level?
Well, he's nearly 40, but I think he may have 5 years left.
Wow, that would really be impressive to play to 45.
Do you think Russell Wilson will have a good year?
Absolutely.  I read he changed his diet this offseason in an effort to remain healthier than last year.
Excellent.  He did have several injuries he played through last year.
Yeah, hip, knee, and chest injuries.
Though I think that losing Earl Thomas was a worse situation for Seattle last year.
I know, the defense was just terrible after he went down with that broken leg.
If he's healthy though, that Defense should still be pretty darn good.
As long as the depth players we brought in from the outside perform, we should be a top 5 defense.
Well, good luck to your Seahawks this year.
Same to you and your Patriots.  Later man.
