How do you like Beyonce?
I think she is a bit over rated to be honest.
Really? How so?
She is more of artist, not so much a singer.
She has an amazing voice!
She has a decent voice, she is a performer not a singer.
Well who do you think is a singer then?
Mariah Carey, now she can sing.
I like her Holiday songs.
Her Christmas albums were beautiful.
Like "All I want for Christmas is You"?
Yes, that is one of the highest selling Christmas albums of all times.
But, Beyonce can sing and perform.
Mariah Carey also performs, she puts on a really amazing show.
Do you think she is better than Whitney Houston?
Vocal wise? No, they were equal.
What about her shows, who does you think was the better performer between the two.
Well, Whitney was a good actress. So her shows always had a lot of drama and story.
I would say Whitney, myself.
I would be inclined to agree her music and performance are a bit better.
