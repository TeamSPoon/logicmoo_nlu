Were you more of an Snoop Dogg or Dr Dre person?
Absolutely Snoop Dogg, was never huge into Dre.
While I would disagree Dre as a whole, I'm a fan, would still agree overall
Yeah Snoop is classic, oddly enough I think the stuff he did with Dre was better than either of their stuff alone.
Oh yeah absolutely. Gin and Juice is essiential.
Renember when he went by Snoop Lion briefly?
Sure do, not sure what he was thinking.
Yes it was bizzare, I'm glad it didn't last though.
Likewise, it seemed like a bad gimmick.
Could'nt agree anymore with you.
