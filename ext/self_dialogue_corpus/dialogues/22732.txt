Have you seen anything interesting lately?
I haven't seen anything new, but I watched an animated film from the 1980s.
What was it called?
The Black Cauldron; have you seen it?
I think I've heard of it but didn't see it as a kid. Was it good?
I didn't think it was great to be honest.
What didn't you like about it?
The main protagonist was unlikable and didn't grow as a character at all.
Is that it?
Also there were several continuity errors.
Was there anyone in it that I would know?
John Hurt was the voice of the villain.
Was the movie received well when it came out?
No, it was considered a major failure for Disney.
That's surprising, what happened to it?
Apparently several animators left and they used a new team.
What other Disney movies came out around then?
I think it came out around the same time as The Great Mouse Detective.
Oh, I really liked that one as a kid.
I did as well.
