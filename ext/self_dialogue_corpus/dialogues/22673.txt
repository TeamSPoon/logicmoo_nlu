Have you been keeping up with the Marvel movies and the time line?
Yes I have, they are sure putting out a lot of movies.
Well, with Thor:Ragnarok, Black Panther, and The Avenger:Infinity War Part One coming out soon, I have a lot of movies to see.
I really enjoyed the first Avengers movies, they were really well done I thought.
I actually preferred the Captain American movies. Civil War being my favorite.
The Spiderman and Ant-man cameos in that movie were great.
Paul Rudd is a amazing Ant-man.
Yes he is, and the new kid they have playing Spiderman has taken well to the roll.
Oh yeah, and the new Spiderman movie is also coming soon.
That is a lot of movies in the Marvel universe. Disney is making so much money from all of these movies.
It is sad there are no more stand alone Iron Man movies.
Well, I can't say I am too sad about that. The last Iron Man movie was pretty terrible.
I have to agree with you there. It was like they were not sure exactly what they wanted to do with that movie.
It is so funny that Stan Lee still makes an appearance in every movie.
Did you see him in Guardians of the Galaxy 2? That was so funny.
Yeah, that was pretty good. Just sitting there in space, it was great.
I wonder how they are going to wrap up all of these different threads into one movie.
Well the Infinity Wars is suppose to literally have everyone in them right?
I thought that was what I read. That will be a huge cast of top names.
Yeah, I can't wait to see both parts of that movie. It is going to be great.
