Hey are you looking forward to the upcoming NFL season?
You know it?
Who you placing your money on this year?
The Cowboys.
Are you serious?
Yeah, why?
The team is just, not so good.
They just have to pull together like any other team. Look they have some really good players.
Like who? Don't say Dez Bryant, who I think is over paid.
That maybe so, but the man is a good wide receiver.
Please, he played in 13 games last year and his defensive game was not so hot.
I'll give you that, But I wasn't banking on him, Ezekiel Elliott.
Ok, I think the "Zeke" has a lot of potential.
Yes. He is an awesome running back.
Like I said, "he has potential."
Ok, listen. In 2016 he was the starting running back; ahead of veterans Alfred Morris and Darren McFadden.
So, what are you trying to say?
That Zeke got game, and the coach knows real talent.
Well, I'll make sure to keep an eye out for him this year.
You already know, I'll be infront of the tv.
