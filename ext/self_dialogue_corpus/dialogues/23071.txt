What is your favorite Bill Murray movie?
That's a terrible question to ask.
Why?
I loved them all.
I know. The ghostbusters movies were hilarious.
They were. Did you ever see What About Bob?
Yes, that was good too.
Not one of his best though.
He even had a role in Zombieland.
Yeah, and got killed awfully quick.
Scrooged was another good one.
Yes, it was.
I heard he was in Get Smart.
Yeah, but it was just a cameo.
Okay, I didn't see that movie.
Well, what would you say was your favorite?
I think Groundhog Day.
I'll have to say mine was the first Ghostbusters.
He is so goofy.
Yes he is.
