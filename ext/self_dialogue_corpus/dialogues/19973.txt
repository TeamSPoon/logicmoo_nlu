Okay, I posted this question in an internet as a joke, but I don't think anyone got it.
Alright, lay it on me...
I said, "Who do you think is more devoted to their potential lover: the Proclaimers or Vanessa Carlton?
Hmm.... uh.. shoot, I'm sorry, you may have to explain that to me.
Ahhh. man, I figured you would get it.
Sorry, bro.
Okay, here it is: the Proclaimers came up with a song call "500 Miles" where they say, "And I would walk 500 hundred miles and I would walk 500 hundred more..."
Oh, yeah, I remember that.. uh.. what was it?  "Just to be the man who'd walk 1,000 miles to fall at your door"?
Yeah, pretty close.  And Vanessa Carlton had a big hit called, "A Thousand Miles" where she says, "And you know I'd walk a thousand miles if I could just see you."
Wait, wait.. that's the video where the girl's playing on the piano while the background seems to be like, passing by her in the background.
Yes, that's it!  If you're curious, they did that by mounting the piano on the back of a truck.
Oh cool.  Alright, NOW I get it.. .it's an interesting question though.. since they'd go travel the same distance.
Well, I didn't mean for it to be a real philosophical discussion.  The thought just popped in my head and I thought it was funny.
Well, let's tackle it though.  They're both going 1,000 miles, but I gotta give to the Proclaimers.
Oh, why's that?
Well, they're will to travel all that way just to FALL DOWN at their lover's door.  They say nothing about actually being able to see her.  (I'm assuming it's a "her", but dunno.)
Okay, yeah, and Vanessa wants to actually SEE her lover in exchange for all this travel.
Yeah, exactly.
Man, the crazy stuff we talk about sometimes, huh?
Yeah.... hehe.
