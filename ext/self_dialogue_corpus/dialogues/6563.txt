Have you seen the live version of Beauty and the Beast?
No I have not seen it yet.
I thought it was great but still like the animated version better.
Really? Where there a lot of differences in the two?
Just a slight few, nothing too major I thought.
Who plays Belle again in the live version?
Belle was played by Emma Watson.
Oh, she seems like a perfect fit for the part.
If you have a chance to see it I would recommend it, I think you will enjoy the Beast who is quite handsome.
I think I will have to rent it although I hear it is quite long so I need to free up some time.
