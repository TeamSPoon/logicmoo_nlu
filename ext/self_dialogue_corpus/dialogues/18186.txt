You're a big fan of the country singer Toby Keith
Yes, I am.
Top five favorite songs?
Number one is easy, "Courtesy of the Red, White and Blue."
That's the one about September eleventh.
Yeah. "Should have been a cowboy" and "How do you like me now"  would be up there.
That's three. What are the final two songs?
I like "He ain't worth Missing" but I'm not sure it'd be top five.
What about "As good as I once was"?
I liked that song when it first came out but it faded quick.
Lost it's shine?
Something like that, yeah. Oh another top five definite. "Beer for my horses."
"Beer for my horses"? What is that song about?
Priorities. What's important in life.
Okay. So what's the fifth favorite Toby Keith song?
Two obvious choices are "Wish I didn't know now" and "a little less talk and a lot more action."
He does come up some interesting titles.
Yes, he does.
So, what's number five/
"Wish I didn't know now." Definitely.
