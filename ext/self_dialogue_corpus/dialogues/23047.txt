Have you seed ET?
Its called ET THE EXTRA-TERRESTRIAL.
It was released in 1982.
It is a science fiction movie.
I think the little boy's name is Elliot.
Steven Spielberg directed the movie well.
He also produced the movie.
It was written by Melissa Mathison.
It had a few actors.
Dee Wallace was in it.
Also Peter Coyote was in it.
And also Henry Thomas was in it.
I liked the music a lot.
Music was by John Williams.
Who distributed it?
I think Universal Pictures.
It's budget was $10 million.
It made almost $800 million.
I wish they made movies like that more.
It will be a real classic.
