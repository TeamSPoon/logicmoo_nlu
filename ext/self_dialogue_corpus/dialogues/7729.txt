What did you think of the romance side of the Harry Potter movies?
The whole Hermoine and Ron thing?
Among others, yes.
I think she should have ended up with Harry.
Like when they danced at the Yule ball?
Yep. They were more equals.
But Ron loved her.
Ron was an idiot. In the last two, he left her and Harry to fend for themselves.
But, he was under the influence of the Horicrux.
Harry was one, but he never left his friends hanging like Ron.
