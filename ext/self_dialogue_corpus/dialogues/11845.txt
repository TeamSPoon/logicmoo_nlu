Don't you think Beatles are one of the greatest music band ever?
totally agreed, I loved their music like crazy
me too! I know this gonna be a hard question, but which song is your favorite?
If I have to chose I think my personal favorite belongs to Let It Be
it's such a soul touching song, isn't it?
yes indeed, I always listen to this song when I'm down, it's uplifting
Agreed. Another sweet song from them is Hey Jude
oh, classic, I'm glad you like it, I remember singing it when I was in high school
yeah, some of my classmates were obsessed with that song as well
haha, everybody got a sweet secret crush
