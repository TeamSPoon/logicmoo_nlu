Are you ready?
For the upcoming NFL season? You know it!
Well, yeah but ready to see some OU Sooners getting some pro action?
Always! It's really great to see these kids get an opportunity to follow their dreams beyond high school and college football.
Yeah, that's always great though... not a fan of any teams that picked them up. Dede Westbrook made it on Jaguars then Samaje Perine  made Redskins and...
Then the two that went to the Bengals. Joe Mixon and Jordan Evans.
Ugh, definitely not a Begnals fan in the slightest.
Same though I did catch a few of their games last season. That October game against the Redskins was intense!
Okay I will agree that was a fun one to watch. Can't believe they tied in overtime.
Yeah, don't see that too often. Think it was... 27 to 27 if I remember correctly.
Really looking forward to seeing the Broncos in action this year. They had a great season last year... as always... but will be interesting to see how they do without Peyton Manning.
It certainly won't be the same without Manning but he should have retired a few seasons back don't you think.
Maybe... but if it was me I would have wanted to stay in as long as possible. Enjoy it "just one more year" y'know?
I guess. Was a real shame that Marshaw Lynch retired also.
Actually, I heard he was coming back.
Really?
Yeah. I think the Raiders picked him up.
Oh wow, that was unexpected. Had him on my fantasy team last season but that injury killed me for a few weeks.
Same here. Hopefully he's back in 100% beast mode this season.
Definitely following the Raiders a lot more closely this year to find out. Been a few years since I've kept up with them so should be interesting.
