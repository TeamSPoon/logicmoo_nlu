I totally love movies from the 80s and 90s! How about you?
Definitely - the period from the mid 80s to mid 90s defines the best movie era to me!
I agree.  Sixteen Candles, Breakfast Club, No Way Out....
Absolutely! Don't forget Weird Science!
Oh yeah right! "Ice is nice!"
Heck, I even loved Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure.
Haha - "You're too tall, Abe!"
"It's just the way I'm built!"
It's amazing how many of the movie quotes we remember.
Yeah, something about being in high school and college at that time, watching the same movies over and over.
And no Internet back then! I'd watch Saint Elmo's Fire or Breakfast Club when I was down in the dumps.
On VHS tape! Seems like so long ago but great memories.
And with some of the actors and actresses in multiple movies it was fun to see where they'd appear next.
Oh yeah? Who do you remember liking?
Definitely Molly Ringwald in Breakfast Club and Sixteen Candles! And Anthony Michael Hall of course.
Oh yeah, he was in all those movies and Weird Science too.  Always cracked me up.
Remember him in Johnny Be Good?
I had totally forgotten that he was in it! Another classic.
We should check out some of these oldies but goodies again!
Let's do it. A good dose of Molly Ringwald in Pretty In Pink would be awesome!
