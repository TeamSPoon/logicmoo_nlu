I can't believe how bad the Mets have been this year.
Yeah, they've been struggling a lot.
Well they thought they would have great pitching but injuries have killed them
Losing Syndergaard is a killer.
Yeah, and Harvey has been terrible.
I think he is still hurting.
Well he had a major injury the last two years.
I'm not sure he has it anymore.
It would stink if he is never great again.
He was the future,  He was going to be a Cy Young winner.
Well at least they still have DeGrom
Yeah, but he's coming off injury too.
He looks decent this year.
Hope he is ok in the long run.
I think he will be.
They need him to be a top pitcher.
Then they just lost Familia too.
I know.  Unblieveable.
I think it's going to be a down year.
Looks that way.
