Do you think the Star Wars film will ever have Yoda again?
I do not think so.
I hope they at least give him more of a back story.
It would be very cool if he got his own movie.
The movies do not even show what he is.
You mean what type of alien?
Right, they say what Chewie is and so on.
I love the big world in the movies.
All the different types of people and creatures.
I think that is what makes the movies so good.
