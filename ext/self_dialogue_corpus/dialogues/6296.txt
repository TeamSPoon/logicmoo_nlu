HEY FRED. I JUST GOT BACK FROM A SPECIAL SCREENING OF THE NEW DISNEY MOVIE POCAHANTAS.
DO YOU THINK ITS AS GOOD AS THE OTHERS FROM THAT STUDIO
IF ANYTHING ITS BETTER.THE COLOR IS SO MUCH BRIGHTER
HOW ABOUT THE MUSIC.
ITS GREAT AS USUAL .AND SOME OF IT IS PLAYED SO LOUDLY,LIKE WITH THE DRUMS.
THAT ALWAYS HELPS SELL THE DISNEYS DOESNT IT.
AND THE STORY LINE. ITS ALMOST HISTORICAL
LIKE THE REAL MEETING OF POCAHANTAS  AND JOHN SMITH
THE ONLY PART I DIDNT LIKE WAS HER GOING BACK TO ENGLAND WITHOUT SMITH.
YEAH,BUT I FEEL CERTAIN THEY WERE IN FOREVER LOVE.
