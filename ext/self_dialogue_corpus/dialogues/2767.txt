You psyched about this coming NFL season?
Oh yeah. Can't wait to see my Giants in action.
You think they will make it to the superbowl this year?
I hope so, they have not been there since 2012.
That's a long time, but they have made it to the playoffs.
Yeah, like 30 something times.
Well maybe this year they can make something happen.
We will see. Who you looking to win the superbowl this year?
I would like to see the Pittsburgh steelers get there and win it all.
A couple of my friends like that team.
They're not bad and back in the day it was like they were one big family; just enjoyable to watch.
Remember the song they made after the team? Black and Yellow.
Ha Ha, yes I liked the beat to it, it was catchy. Who made that?
I think it was some rapper named Wiz Khalifa.
Oh. Well the artist did a good job to represent the team.
Yeah and the song will never grow old, because there will always be "Team Steelers."
The Steelers have been to the superbowl 6 times and this year's predictons for the steelers says they have a good chance to make it happen again.
What about the Giants?
It is perdicted that they will have a 12-4 season.
Sweet, I guess we will see. Maybe they will make it a 5th time.
