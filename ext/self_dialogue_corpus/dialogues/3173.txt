Zeke is a beast! Zeke and Dak should take the cowboys to the Superbowl!
Here we go again. Cowboys need a better receiving core, if they're to go to the Superbowl, let alone win it
Their receivers aren't very good. They could be so much better.
You know what's funny? The longest pass Dak's ever thrown in 2016 wasn't caught by their receivers.
Oh yeah, Zeke caught it.
Yep, against the Steelers, 83 yards!.
That's long for WRs even
Yep. Zeke's gonna be a valuable player.
You know Dak passes as much as Brady, even slightly more.
yep, they're both above 3500 yards for the last year
And Pat's total rushing is 1872, and Cowboys 2396.
Yep. But look at their TDs. 24 Rushing TDs, and 25 receiving TDs for the Cowboys.
And the pats have... 19 rushing TDs and 32 receiving TDs. See that's not that impressive over the Cowboys
Well, it's not so much how TDs you have, how many more you have over your opponent when you're playing the game
So then why bother looking at season TD numbers?
It shows the strengths and pattern of their plays, which is important to make prediction as to what will unfold this year
I don't know, man, this is getting too complicated
Well, this is what it means to analyze the teams. And there are so many dimensions to look at
To think there are people who do this for a living
Yep. Football anbalysts work for TV channels and fantasy sites. Unless they're famous, they don't make much though
