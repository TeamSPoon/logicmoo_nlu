Ok, what do you think is the best Disney ballad?
Colors of the Wind!
That's good, but not as good as Reflection.
That's just because of Lea Salonga.
Ok, you might be right. What about Part of Your World?
Does that count as a ballad?
I think so.
Hmm. Still not as good Colors of the Wind.
Colors of the Wind has a killer bridge, I agree.
It's so inspirational, honestly.
