What is your favorite action movie?
Dark Knight, without a doubt!
That was a pretty good flick.
Heath Ledger played the best Joker ever!
Yeah, but Batman was a little lacking.
It's that stupid voice he puts on.
He does a great Wayne though.
True. He plays a playboy to the hilt.
And alfred is just wonderful.
You can't really top Micheal Caine.
