What's the next movie you're going to see?
I think that we will go to the latest "Pirates of the Caribbean"
Did you like the last one?
It was ok, although I thought it was very dark.
Not a kid's movie?
Definitely not a kids movie?  More like a 'tween movie.
So why are you going to this one?
I have heard good things about it...and well, Johnny Depp.
Why Johnny Depp, is he your favorite?
Well, he is a good actor, but it is his Keith Richard's imitation that I really enjoy.
Anything else about it?
I've been reading online reviews, they said it was on par with the first of the series
Didn't you like the other ones?
There were moments in the the other ones that I found interesting, but there were a lot of dull spots.
Why is that?
In the movies following the first ones that had a lot of fight scenes.
Well, it is a pirate movie, swashbuckling and all that.
Yes, but the fight scenes went on way too long. Unless you are heavily into fight choreography, you start zoning out.
Oh yeah, that happens to me too.
Plot is so important, directors forget that sometimes when they have lots of money, they like to add bells and whistles.
