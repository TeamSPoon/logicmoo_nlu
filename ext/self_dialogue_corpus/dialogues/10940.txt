So the Pittsburgh Penguins won the series over the Washington Capitals?
Yes, I saw Game Seven the other night.
It seems like Washington just can't get the job done in the playoffs.
Yeah they got knocked out early last year too.
With Ovechkin as their star, it seems like they should do better.
I agree, but maybe they don't have the right chemistry and teamwork.
The Capitals had the best record in the league in the record season this year too.
I know. It's such a waste to have so many wins in the regular season, and then save your bad play for the elimination rounds.
So now the Penguins are in the Conference Finals. Do you think they advance?
Yes, I think their experience and composure get the job done again.
It's amazing that Sidney Crosby is so young, and yet has been to the Stanley Cup so many times.
He truly is a clutch player, and he appears to be a good teammate as well.
Did you see that nasty hit he took that gave him a concussion in the last series?
Yes, it was a nasty-looking check, but he seems to be alright now.
Do you think he'll have any lingering effects or headaches from it?
No, I heard that he passed all the baseline tests and that the medical staff was confident in his health.
So it's on to the next round then for the Penguins. If they get past the Senators, do you think they win it all?
Yeah, they've got to be considered the favorite to win the Cup.
I agree with you. Pittsburgh just has too much firepower to be stopped.
I want some competitive series and game sevens, so I hope that Pittsburgh doesn't dominate too much.
