What did you think of the artist Prince?
I thought he was a super interesting guy.
I was so sad when he died.
Yes a big loss for the music world.
His purple rain was everything to me at one point.
I always loved Little red corvette and Kiss most.
He had so many great songs. When doves cry always was one of my favorites.
It was a good one. I loved how unique he was overall.
He really was an original artist. Even his guitar had a unique twist.
He was also a vegan and very active in a lot of charity work too.
