Who is your favorite non-Jedi or Sith character in all the Star Wars movies?
I would have to say Han Solo.
Interesting, why do you favor him more than others?
Well, hes one of the most witty guys in the series, and he is loyal to his friends.
I agree about that, he always helped his friends out.
I would have to say if not for him, my favorite non-Jedi or Sith character would be Jango Fett.
Yeah, he is awesome.
He really is ruthless the way he will kill anyone.
Sometimes that's what it takes to get ahead, especially when you have no Jedi powers.
Yeah, I guess that makes sense.
