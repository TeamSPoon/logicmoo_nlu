Are you into Hip Hop?
Not much, but I did see an interesting documentary on it.
Oh, yeah? What was that about?
It's origins.
It started in the 80's, right?
No, before that.
When?
Like early to mid 70's.
No way!
Apparently it started in the New York club scene.
Rap?
Not really. Mostly just the beats, but the lyrics were far behind.
Why hadn't I ever heard of that?
It didn't really go mainstream until the 80's.
That makes sense.
The first big spotlight was a song by Blondy.
No way!
It's true.
What was that like?
She composed a rap about Grand Master Flash.
