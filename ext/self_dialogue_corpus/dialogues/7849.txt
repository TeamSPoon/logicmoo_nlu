Severus Snape as a character absolutely disgusts me.
What! Why?
Because he unapologetically abused his students for years.
But he loved Lily though! He saved Harry because of his love for her!
Yes, because of a creepy obsession with a woman whom he called the equivalent of a racial slur.
He was under stress at the time! And he protected Harry to try and make it up to her!
He made it up to the love of his life by treating her son like subhuman garbage for seven years?
...Well when you put it like that...
Exactly. I acknowledge that Snape saved a lot of people, Harry included, by doing what he did, but that does not absolve him of a lifetime of being an abuser.
I think I need to reread the series now...
