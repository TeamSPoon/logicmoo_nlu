Did you like the Backstreet Boys?
Uh, I still love them, actually.
I thought their music was so fun and light hearted.
Agreed, though some was dark.
True, The Call was about cheating I believe.
Yep, but....it was catchy.
I wish they would get back together....
Me too, I thought they were a great band.
I also like NSYNC.
Me too, I think they were an amazing band.
I just love boy bands in general.
Well a lot of people from NSYNC have had solo careers since, which I think is cool.
Yeah, Justin Timberlake for example.
He was always the most popular member to begin with, though.
Because his voice was so good, and he was cute.
Yeah, well his songs now are so good.
I like his music videos too.
My favorite is What Goes Around....
Yeah, Rock Your Body is good too.
So many good songs!
