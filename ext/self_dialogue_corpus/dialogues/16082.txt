Can we turn on the radio? It's going to be a long drive.
Sure. Do you have any preferences.
Not really. Let's just see what's on.
Sounds like country, that okay with you?
I don't really care for country.
How about this?
Is this Taylor Swift?
Katy Perry. I'm guessing this isn't good either.
Sorry, I guess I'm pickier than I thought.
How about this?
The Beatles? I can get into this for a bit.
I've always loved Paperback Writer.
It's already over though!
And I don't recognize this.
I don't either. Let's change it up again.
This is getting complicated. Want to just put something on from my phone?
Sure. Hand it over.
Here you go. No promises though.
Ugh, can we just do NPR?
Whatever you want.
