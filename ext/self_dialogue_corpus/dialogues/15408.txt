What kind of music do you like?
I'm a fan of lots of different kinds.  What is your favorite?
I really like 80s hair bands and rock.
I like some of them.  I guess my favorite is Bon Jovi.  I like their album "Slippery When Wet."
I'm an Bon Jovi fan too, but I think they were a bit overplayed.  Some of my favorites are Winger, Def Leppard, and Queen.
I'm really only familiar with Queen from that group.
Queen was great.  The lead singer, Freddie Mercury died a while back, and Queen recently went on tour with Adam Lambert as the lead singer.
Adam Lambert?  Wasn't he on American Idol?
Yes, he came in second.  Although I think he should have won.
Yes he does have a beautiful voice.
I think he sounds a lot like Freddie Mercury.
I can definitely see the vocal resemblence.
If you get a chance, you should definitely listen to Def Leppard some time.
What is the name of one of their albums?
Pyromania is one of their best albums in my opinion.
I will have to check that out sometime.  What are some of their songs?
They sing "Photograph," "Foolin," and "Animal."
I actully think I have heard some of those.  I just didn't know who sang them.
They are great.  Their drummer lost his arm in a car accident, and he had to learn how to play drums using one arm and his feet.
That is amazing.  I'm really interested to look them up.
