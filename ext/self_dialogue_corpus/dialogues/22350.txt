I love movies
Me too, let's talk about movies
Do you have a favorite kind of movie
I like horror and comedy, you?
I like comedy and animated
Animated movies are cute
Have you seen all the saw movies?
No only the first couple, what about you
Same here.
I didn't like them after 2 or 3, they got really dumb
And pointless, that's why I stopped watching
Have you seen the haunting
Yes that was a great movie one of my favorites.
It was put together well
I love thirteen ghosts
I forgot all about that movie, it's a great movie
It is, I haven't seen it in so long
Me either
I need to rewatch it now
Same here
