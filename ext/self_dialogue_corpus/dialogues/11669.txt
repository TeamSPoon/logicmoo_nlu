With the Sgt.Pepper album cover some say it was creepy with occult overtones?
Most definately I could see why they are saying that.
Care to clarify?
Yes,well for one Aleister Crowley the godfather of Satanists was on that cover.
Wow! I could see why that album is a little creepy.
Speaking of creepy the wax models of the Beatles creeped me out on that cover!
Do you think having Aleister Crowley on the cover was really a sign that the Beatles were opening up the door to occultism?
Yes, this was a peak. Also Lewis Carrol who Crowley loved was also on that cover.
Who knew?Everybody back then thought the Beatles were innocent lads from Liverpool.
They were very far from four innocent lads from Liverpool.
