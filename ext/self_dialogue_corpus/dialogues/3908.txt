I remember Silence of the Lambs and I thought it crazy at the time.
Me too. Now it seems so mild in comparison to what is out there now.
I know. I thought Anthony Hopkins was really good in it, but now now it feels over acted.
I know what you mean. When you see Red Dawn and some of the others I have to agree.
Which one was Edward Norton in? He was the detective. Red Dragon. You were almost right.
Yeah, then there was also Hannibal Rising.
I don't remember that one. When did it come out? Did you see it?
I think it was 2007. It's about Hannibal's family being killed and what happened to him after.
So it's the prequel telling you how he got to be the way he was.
Interesting that might be worth checking out. All these movies out of sequence is so confusing.
