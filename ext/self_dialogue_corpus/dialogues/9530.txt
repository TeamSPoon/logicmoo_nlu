Hey, do you know anything about Eminem?
Not really, is there something interesting about him?
Yes! Did you know he dropped out of school?
Really, what else?
He often made songs about his family. His mom, his ex-wife, and his daughter. His lyrics run deep.
That's interesting, what else has he done?
He starred in the movie, 8 Mile. It's about his life.
I'll have to check it out sometime.
Yeah, you should. It's really neat.
Thank you for telling me about Eminem!
