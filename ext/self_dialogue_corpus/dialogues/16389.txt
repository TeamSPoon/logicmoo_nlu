Ever hear Cathy Richardson?
No. Who is she?
She's a cute blonde singer who was with Jeffershon Starship for awhile.
What happened to Grace Slick?
She's been gone for years. Many years.
I just saw a video with her a few months ago. She was all white but still with them.
I saw that video too. It was just a guest appearance.
Really? So when did she leave?
Probably before I was born, sometime in the 70s.
I never knew that. So that's when they got this new girl?
No, they've had several other singers. Cathy Richardson joined around 2007 or 2008.
I just found a video of her doing White Rabbit. She's hot!
The live one where she's being really dramatic?
Ahuh. She's almost like an actress.
She actually is an actress too.
This is a great video. She sounds a lot like Grace too.
Definitely. Maybe even better!
Is she still with them?
I don't think so. She has her own band called Macrodots.
Funny name!
