I sure like the potential for Carr with the Raiders!
I agree, he seems poised to be a great one.
He may already have passed Andrew Luck on the food chain.
Maybe, but I still prefer Luck.He did't close his atrocious offensive line, the newly fired GM, Greyson did!
Well, he certainly didn't do Andrew any favors.He is still young.He has amazing physical tools.
His stats are trending down.At one time, people would have taken him over Brady.
That was then..this is now!
Dak Prescott! Was he a one-hit wonder?
Well, he just got hemmed up in a fiasco with an autograph machine.
Poor decision! His people should have known better.If Prescott plays like he did last year for the Cowboys..
..They will need a Brinks Truck to carry away all his cash.No unnecessary distractions!
I think he is the "real deal". Jerry Jones, the Boys Owner, does as well, and he signs the paychecks!
Romo retired to the color booth.He got the message.
Yeah, Phil Simms got kicked from the top CBS broadcast team.
Phil HAD to go.He has been ragtime for years!
I agree and then some!
How about the Broncos.What do you think?
Well, i am not sure, but I think Andre Ware retired. They need more ballers.
I also like the potential of Houston, with a healthy Watt, and Brian Cushing.
It is still not enough to topple the Patriots.Let's not even talk about those cheaters!
