Have you watched the Littler Mermaid before?
I have ! The best part is when she used a fork as a comb
I wonder how she kept her hair so nice in and out of the water?
I know , people always talk about how perfect her hair was.
I liked the part when Jasper was stuck in the kitchen and the chef was trying to boil him
that part was funny. Ursula was awful, she had her own powers she should have left the mermaids alone
I know, that part when she had the dried up mermaids stuck in the ocean floor was sad and disturbing
ariel's dad could be scary as well, like when he destroyed her special place
I hated that part, he was trying to keep her safe though
I am glad that in the end she got to marry Eric and have her legs and still see her dad and family.
