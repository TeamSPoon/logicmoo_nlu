Have you seen Guardians of the Galaxy?
I just did!
How did you like it?
I loved it, Chris Pratt is a great leading man
I agree, I was surprised he was so funny and charming
If you saw him on Parks and rec you know he was a goofball
I was really impressed by the CGI in the move
I was too, they weaved it in so well, most movies you can tell they're using special effects
Yeah, they had a lot going on, but it didn't distract from the movie
Who was your favorite, Rocky Racoon or Groot?
That is a hard one, but I did love Groot
I though Rocky Racoon was hysterical
Yes, but Groot was so sweet
I heard that there's a baby Groot in the sequel!
Really? I have not seen it yet
Me neither. I hope it is as good
Well, if they have the same cast it has to be good
You are right. We should see it!
Is it still playing?
I just checked it is!
