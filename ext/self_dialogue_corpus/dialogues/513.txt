RODGERS!!! DISCOUNT DOUBLE CHECK. Don't sleep on A T L
True, Ryan and Julio will probably light it up again this year. Who do you like in the AFC
The Jets....HAHAHAHAHA Nah, New England has to be the favorite
The Pats? Even with all of the hooplah surrounding the aging Brady and less-than-stellar D?
Absolutely, We are even going to a game this year in Foxboro
Oh yeah? Nosebleed seats?
50-Yard-Line actually, I'm gonna be hanging with the Gronk. Who do you like?
I think Mariota and Tennesee will be the favorite in the south...
Over Luck and the Colts?
Absolutely. Chiefs out West...
Chiefts out West? Now I know you're out of your mind. You think Andy Reid is going to suit up and block? Denver out West
Denver? Please, they haven't been good since Vonn Miller realized his Madden Avatar was prettier than he was
Ha. Well, At least we know one thing.
What's that?
The Jets aren't going to be playing more than 16
