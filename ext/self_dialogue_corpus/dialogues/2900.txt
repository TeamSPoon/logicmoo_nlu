Do you have any clue if the Washington Redskins are a good team?
Not really, why?
My sons friend was bragging about their stats.
We could always look them up.
Yes, I thought you might know.
I do follow a lot of the NFL stats but only teams I like.
I know that Kirk Cousins is on the team.
What position is he?
He is a quarterback.
He might be the one who broke records in 2016.
Not sure if anyone else good is on the team.
I just can't believe they people wanted them to change their name.
I know.
People get so offended by some dumb things.
I'm glad they didn't. I'd consider it an honor to have a team want to refernce a heritage.
Me too.
I do know that Don Shula used to play for them in the fifties.
Really, The Dolphins old coach?
Yes.
Well that's pretty cool to know.
