I wonder why they chose to alter some scenes in the movies
Well for the movies to flow better it had to be done
But why though it saddens me to have changes
Well they skip some parts
Oh i knew some was altered but not skipped
Well obvisouly they do
Why though
Because they need to make it fit together good
I guess that makes perfect sense
Yeah you want it to be good and concise
