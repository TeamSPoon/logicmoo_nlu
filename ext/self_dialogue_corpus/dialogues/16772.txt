Yo you like Matisyahu?
Matis who?
MATISYAHU!
Who's that?
It's a jewish reggae singer
Dude you know I don't listen to reggae
But have you heard of him?
Maybe? What are some of his songs?
Jerusalem, king without a crown, one day
Hmmm maybe, those his older stuff?
Yup, not a huge fan of the new stuff
Why not?
It doesn't feel quite as emotionally driven
How so?
Like it just feels like he's any ole reggae singer now on weed and trying to get money
Instead of being who he used to be?
Yeah. I miss the old Matis.
That stinks. Maybe I'll listen to his old stuff
Heck yeah you should
Well I will!
