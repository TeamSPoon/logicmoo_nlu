Who's your all time favorite singer?
That's a tough one but Taylor Swift, probably.
I think she's a bit overrated, personally.
Really? How do you not love her classic songs like "Teardrops on my Guitar" and "Love Story"?
Oh, I do like those older songs but I don't like her new pop songs.
I love to jam out to those ones while I dance!
They just sound a bit too auto-tuned for my liking.
Who's your favorite artist of all time?
I think Billy Joel.
Oh, he's a good one too!
Yeah, he's truly timeless!
I'll say my parents grew up listening to him and I still listen to him.
What's your favorite song by him?
I'd have to say "The Ballad of Billy the Kid."
I love that one!
What's your favorite song by him?
I k."ow it's super popular but "Piano Man"
That one is such a classic!
All of his music is really classics.
That's very true.
