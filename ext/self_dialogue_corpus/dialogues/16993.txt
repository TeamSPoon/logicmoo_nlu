How did you think Britney Spears' career happened?
She was a child actor.
Do you think she tapped all her potential?
Hit me baby one more time was huge!
Yeah it was, she also had Toxic too
We could name a ton of hits.
Do you think she left it all out on the table.
Yeah and now she works in  Vegas
Kinda sad she could be doing better
I think she had a bad time in her life.
What drew you to her music
I think her voice was spectacular for awhile
I would agree with you
She sounded different than the other pop stars of the time
Yeah and I think she had enormous talent.
I remember when Hit Me Baby One More Time came out.
I liked lucky better
I thought it was too slow of a song
Well they all changed their pace
Yeah I guess they need to appeal
