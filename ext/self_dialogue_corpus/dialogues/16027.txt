Did you get the tickets?
Of course I did! You think I'd leave Leopold's without them?
I don't know, sometimes you forget stuff. And you never really liked Backstreet Boys did you?
I never admitted to liking Backstreet Boys. But um...
You sly cat! All this time I've been lusting over Donnie Wahlberg in secret I could have shared my love with you?
I wouldn't go that far. I kinda liked the little one, what's his name?
The little one? Weren't they all little?
Uh no. Not your boy Wahlberg, he was a tough guy.
He was. Girl I still have my NKOTB puzzle with a big picture of his face.
Oh my gosh you do? I have to see it.
Here. This came out right after "Please Don't Go Girl" was burning up the airwaves.
Oh snap, I love that song!
Please don't go girrrrrrrrrrrl! It would ruin my whole worrrrrrrrrld.
Um. What did he write on here?
Oh, that? Just some super hip slang.
Super hip slang, huh? Pretty sure it says--
"Peace Out On The Strength! - D."
Oh my gosh it sure does. Is he... kissing his fingertips?
Yeah, you know how all the tough guys used to do that back then while singing falsetto.
Oh yeah that. I almost forgot. Real cool, that Donnie Wahlberg.
