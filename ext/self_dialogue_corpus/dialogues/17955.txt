Do you like the band Creed?
Yes, I have three of their albums?
They broke up didn't they?
They broke up but got back together in 2009.
Oh, are they still making music then?
No one knows if they will make any more music but probably not many are in new bands.
Where is Scott Stapp?
He joined Art of Anarchy.
What do you think was their best album?
I personally liked Human Clay.
I think everyone knows that one the best.
That is where they had their pop single Higher.
Personally I liked Are You Ready? better.
I like the whole album.
On the Weathered Album I like the song Weathered.
That album was not as good.
It has a progression to it
What do you mean?
The songs in the beginning are faster then the songs get slower as the album continues
I never noticed that.
