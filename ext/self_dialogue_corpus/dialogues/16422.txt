Hey, you took music theory, right?
I have three degrees in it. You know I have my PhD in theory.
Oh, right, the throwaway class.
I've never had someone take it as a throwaway class because they always fail. You can't wing this class.
So, favorite...chord?
You'll regret that question.
I already do.
My favorite musical chord is a German Augmented Sixth.
What is that? It sounds crazy.
It contains scale degrees b3, #4, b6, and 1, with b6 usually in the bass.
What makes it so special?
Well, b6 and #4 resolve to 5, making two chromatic voices approach the dominant by half-step, which is very strong.
Sounds basic.
No, it's not. It also can sound like a V7 (and thus a secondary dominant)  and can be used to modulate anywhere.
I have no idea what that means or what you do.
Okay, it means it's a fun chord that can do lots of different things.
Got it.
You really should study music more. It's a pretty simple concept.
I took music appreciation but didn't really do any work and got a C.
Yeah, sounds about right.
