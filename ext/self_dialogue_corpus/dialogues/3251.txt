I saw the scariest movie ever last night!
What did you watch?
The original Halloween.
Oh that is a good one. John Carpenter is a great director.
I like him too. What's your favorite movie of his?
I like Escape from L.A.a lot.
That one is pretty good, not very scary though. What's your favorite scary movie by John Carpenter?
Probably, Vampires then.
I liked that one too. Its great when vampires are actually scary and they aren't sparkling teenagers.
I couldn't agree more!
