Why did the Knicks give Carmelo that no trade clause?
No clue, he would have signed there no matter what due to the max contract they gave him.
Yeah, and now it is really coming back to bite them cause they clearly want him gone.
Well that's what happens when your GM is running out of control.
Or maybe just doesn't care at all.
True, that is more likely.
And now he is pissing off Kirstaps which is the worst thing he could do.
Yeah I bet he is gone as soon as he can be.
Do you think he will demand a trade?
No, I think he knows that would really damage his image.
True.  Hopefully this time on the Knicks doesn't poison him cause he is really special.
Yeah is is the ultimate stretch player.
Correct, and they are trying to run the dang triangle with him, Melo, and Rose.
Yeah clearly that is not going to work
It just seems like there is no plan.
Maybe that is because there is not.
Well except for Dolan to keep cashing those checks.
Haha, yes it must be nice to own the most valuable team in the NBA and do nothing.
Except hire Phil Jackson to placate the fans.
And then sit back and watch as he runs the team into the ground.
