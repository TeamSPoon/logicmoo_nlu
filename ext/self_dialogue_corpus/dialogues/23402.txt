I can't wait to see the new Aliens movies tonight.
Me either, I grew up watching the originals.
Me too, I still have the box set on VHS.
Ha, I just have the dvds.
The Original Alien still holds up after all these years.
Sigourny Weaver was so good as Ripley.
Yeah, when she battles the Alien mother in the second movie in the Robot lifting machine, what a brilliant fight scene.
I almost forgot about that, man it was the best ending.
She was nominated for an academy award for Aliens.
i didn't know that, she's not in this new movie is she?
No, i don't think so.
Do you know who directed Alien Covenant?
Scott Ridley
That's fantastic.  Didn't he direct the original too?
Yes, I am excited to see what he does differently with this remake.
From the trailers and pictures i have seen the aliens look like they did in the old movies.
As long as they stick to the suspence and not just gore, this movie should be as scary.
I hope so, I want to be as scared as I was when I watched the first one.
Me too, I want to be hiding in my sweatshirt.
Cool, i am gonna hide behind my tub of popcorn.
