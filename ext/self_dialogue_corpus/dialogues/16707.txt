Are you into the band Queens of the Stone Age.
Oh yeah, they've got some really awesome songs. What's your favorite album of theirs?
That's a tough call! I would probably have to go with Songs for the Deaf personally. How about you?
Songs for the Deaf was great and it definitely put them on the map. I think my favorite is their latest one though, Like Clockwork.
I loved that album too. I hear that they'll be releasing new music soon which I'm really excited about.
I didn't know that, I'll have to keep an eye out for that!
Have you ever seen then perform live?
No, I haven't unfortunately, have you?
Yes, several times in fact, you definitely should catch them if they're in town, their live act is incredible.
I will definitely do that! Have you been to any other concerts lately?
The last one I went to was a Mark Lanegan concert. I even got to meet him after the show.
Whoa, lucky! He works with Queens of the Stone Age a lot too, right?
Yup, he's been on every album of theirs except the first I think. His voice is out of this world.
I agree, definitely one of the best singers around. He kind of has a Tom Waits vibe about him at times with that gravelly voice.
Tom Waits is another legend for sure. I can understand the comparison between the two.
Yeah, they're both hugely talented, one of a kind vocalists. I'm really hoping to see Tom Waits on tour too.
I haven't had the pleasure myself, but that would be epic.
What's your favorite Tom Waits album?
Probably Rain Dogs, it's such a classic.
Swordfishtrombones for me, but I totally agree about Rain Dogs.
