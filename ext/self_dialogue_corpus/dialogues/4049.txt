Are there any scary movies you are excited to see?
I'm waiting for that reboot of IT
Oh, the scary clown movie? Are they making a new one
Yeah, and apparently it is more closer to the original thriller novel than the movie was
Wow, I wonder if it will be as scary as the original
Honestly, I dont find the original to be very scary. It was way too cheesy
Are you kidding me? Tim Curry's make up had me scared to sleep for weeks!
Honestly, it was all too outdated for my taste
I wonder how good the new one will be
I've seen the trailer, and it was already getting me freaked out!
