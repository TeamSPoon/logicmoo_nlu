I am looking into making a mix tape of love songs for my fianc√©.
That is so sweet, what songs are you going to put on it?
I have only picked out 3 so far,  the first one is Uncle Kracker smile.
I like that song, what is the second?
The second is I Need You by Faith Hill and Tim McGraw.
Great choice, what is the third?
The third is Honey Bee by Blake Shelton.
You have some great songs picked out so far.
Thank you, do you have any suggestions?
What about Everything I Do by Bryan Adams.
That is a good choice, that way it isn't all country songs.
Yes, and you could also choose some songs by Rod Stewart.
I love his music, especially Have I Told You Lately.
Great song by him.
I also like All For Love by Rod Stewart, Bryan Adams, and Sting.
You should definitely put that song on the mix.
I will thank you for your suggestions.
You are so welcome.
I can't wait to listen to the mix when you are finished.
I will make sure I share it with you then.
