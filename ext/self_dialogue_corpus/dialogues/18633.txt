Who do you think is the best contemporary male singer right now?
I believe it's Adam Lambert.
Oh he is so good.
I don't know how he can reach all those high notes.
I really enjoyed watching him on American Idol.
I remember when he sang Play That Funky Music. He sounded so good.
I actually liked his version better than the original by Wild Cherry.
I remember him auditioning with Bohemian Rhapsody and how he blew the judges away.
When I got his first CD I played it over and over again.
Did you have a favorite song?
Yes. For Your Entertainment.
Mine was Whataya You Want From Me.
That was also good.
I would love to see him perform live.
He;s still touring with Queen.
He's got the perfect voice to be their frontman.
Even though he didn't win American Idol, I thin he's been having a successful career.
Probably more so than even some of the winners.
Do you know if he has a new CD coming out?
I don't, but I'll find out.
