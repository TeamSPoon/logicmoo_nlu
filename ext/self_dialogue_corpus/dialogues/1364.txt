I am so excited today!
Why is that?
It is just about a month until the first preseason NFL game!
That is exciting, it is about time football start back up.
Who is your team?
I like the Kansas City Chiefs.
They have been doing better the last few years, no?
They have. It has been fun to be a fan.
Too bad they haven't been able to make it to the Super Bowl.
I know. I think we just need some more consistency.
Well, hopefully they do better this year.
Who is your time?
I like the Green Bay Packers.
They do well pretty consistently, no?
They do, but kind of like the Chiefs we haven't been able to put together a Super Bowl run lately.
When was the last time they were in the big game?
I believe it was 2011.
Yeah, it has been awhile. But you have a lot of great players on your team.
Hopefully Aaron Rogers and Jordy Nelson will be spot on this year.
They are pretty unstoppable.
