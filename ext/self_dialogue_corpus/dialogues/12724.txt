Out of all of the Star Wars movies, who is your favorite character?
I think like a lot of the fans out there, mine was always Han Solo.
He is up there for me, as well. How surprised were you at this untimely demise in Force Awakens?
I actually wasn't too caught off guard by it, since Harrison Ford has stated he's always wanted Solo to be killed off.
I've heard that, as well. In terms of his character, do you think it wasn't a very heroic death?
I was okay with it the way it executed. He died while trying to save his son.
I understand your point. It was also in a way, a sort of passing the torch off to the new character.
Definitely. And I wouldn't rule out recurring appearances of him.
You think they'll bring Solo back in flashbacks/visions?
Quite possibly. He was an extremely popular character so any way to bring him back would be great. Especially for the final episode.
