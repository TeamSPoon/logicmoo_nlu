Would you consider more of a fan of retro rap, such as back in the '90's, or today?
Honestly, somewhere in between. I am a bit more of a '90's person when it comes to rap, but I do like some of stuff from the 2000's.
Are particular favorite rapper you enjoy?
Actually, growing up, I was a big fan of Eminem. His music was always quite good, in my opinion.
He was definitely at his peak, I think in the early 2000's with the Marshal Mathers LP album.
To this day, I think that was his best album.
Oh definitely. What's your favorite song by Eminem?
That's a tough one. I am going to go a little outside the box and go with "Stan." I just really love the story the song told.
Could you refresh my memory on that song or better yet, the story?
Essentially, the verses are a crazed fan writing to Eminem, and as the song goes on, and we go into his second, and then third letter, he begins to lose it due to not getting a response.
