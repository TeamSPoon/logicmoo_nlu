I miss the good old days of cartoons.
What kind do you mean.
Like the old epic Disney ones.
Such as?
Well, like Beauty and the Beast, and Peter Pan.
I loved the old Peter Pan cartoon!
It was so magical. I hardly ever see it on DVD anymore.
I loved the way the animation looked.
I loved the plot. The kids growing up but not realizing it.
Wendy and her brothers learning from Peter.
