What song is hugely popular that you dislike?
Pharell's HAPPY.
wow I thought everyone loved that song!
It got way too much play time and became annoying to me.
I can see that overplayed aspect.
Happens to a lot of chart toppers.
I think it was number one for the whole year.
Well I know it was the best selling song of 2014.
Pharrell had wrote it for ceelo green.
Really? what happened?
I guess it was recorded but ceelo's record choose to scrap it.
what why would they do that?
To put out a christmas cd with the muppets.
I remember that cd.  It was cute. But not the sales  success like HAPPY!
Ya I would be pissed if I were ceelo.
Itis too bad he didn't have more control on his own stuff.
I think that is how it happens often sadly.
Ya record labels have a lot of control.
Too much maybe.
I think this is where youtube has really helped a lot of indie artists out a ton!
