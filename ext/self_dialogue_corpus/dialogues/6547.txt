Did you watch Pete's Dragon?
No. What's that about?
It is an animated Disney film.
I have to check it out.
They are playing it at the local theatre. Would you like to go?
Sure. Lets go.
I think we should see the 3-D version.
I agree! It will enhance the experience.
The first time I saw it was not in 3-D.
Really? I guess it's time for you to relive the experience in 3-D!
