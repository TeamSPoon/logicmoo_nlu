Did you ever watch any of the Nightmare movies?
Nightmare on Elm Street?
Yeah, any of those.
Yeah, those are my favorite!
Do you like Friday the 13th?
Not really, but I love the Freddie movies!
What do you like so much about them?
Freddie is unique.
What do you mean?
I mean, it's not the typical slasher deal.  He kills them in improbable ways.
Oh, yeah.  You can never guess what is going to happen.
Right.  Jason Voohries is much more predictable.
Yeah, like that time Freddie sucked the life out of a girl in class when she fell asleep.
Yeah, something like that.  She had an asthma attack?
I don't remember.  I don't even remember which one that was.
I think it was the second one.
I've read that the guy that plays Freddie is a real nice guy.
Well, it is acting.
Yeah, but the dude looks so sick!
I wouldn't want to be friends with him either.
