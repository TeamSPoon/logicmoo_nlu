Music sure has changed these days.
What do you mean?
Well I mean everything has gone electronic.
Yea, even old bands are doing it now.
Anything to stay relevant I guess.
Well, alternative artists aren't really going down that path.
Yea I guess I should be thankful for that.
Could you image Blink 182 auto-tuning themselves?
Wow, that would be so horrible.
Or what if Green Day started doing it?
Man, I'd be so disappointed in them.
Music has just gotten extremely commercial.
Yea, it really is all about the money.
On the positive side, musicians are still at least pretending to be legitimate artists.
Why is that a positive thing?
Because it means people still care about legitmacy.
You're right. But how long do you think that will last.
Probably a couple more generations.
Yea, and then people won't even care.
Yea, they'll just download an ap that sings to them.
