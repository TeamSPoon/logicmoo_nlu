Which of the original Star Wars trilogy was your favorite?
I definitely think Empire Strikes back was my favorite because it was so dark.
I liked that about Empire Strikes back too. The way it didn't have a happy ending.
The reveal of Vader as being Luke's father was astonishing. I remember seeing that and was simply shocked.
I think it was such a defining moment in the Star Wars Trilogy.
Did you enjoy Return of the Jedi more than Star Wars though?
I would rank the trilogy as Empire Strikes Back, Return of the Jedi, and then Star Wars. It's not to say Star Wars was bad it was more of a set up.
I think a lot of people ranked Star Wars over Return of the Jedi because they didn't like the Ewoks.
That's ridiculous the Ewoks were cute and so cool. They helped the rebellion fight during that whole battle of Endor.
Oh I'm not disagreeing just mentioning what most people think of the ranking of the series. I loved the Ewoks too. We need to see them return in future Star Wars!
