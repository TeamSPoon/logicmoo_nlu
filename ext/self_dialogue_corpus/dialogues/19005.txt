What do you think of Rihanna?
I think she is beautiful and has a nice voice.
I have liked almost every song she has came out with.
Me too, I have bought all her CD's that she has made.
She has a great presence and a beautiful voice.
Yes, she is Caribbean, there are not many famous Caribbean artists like her.
I remember hearing about her and Chris Brown in the news.
Yes, that was sad. But I think she has stayed single pretty much since then.
I have heard that as well, but also know that Drake is in love with her.
Oh yes, he is not shy about how he feels for Rihanna.
They have done so many good songs together as well.
She also went on tour with Eminem and did quite a few songs with him as well.
That was a great collaboration.
Didn't Jay-Z find her and get her started?
I believe so, that is what I have heard anyways.
I hope she continues to make music for a while.
I do not see her leaving the industry anytime soon, she has her own style.
I think it would be nice to hear her and Beyonce do a song together.
That would be a great combo, but I doubt it will ever happen.
I have heard there were some issues between the two, so you are probably right.
