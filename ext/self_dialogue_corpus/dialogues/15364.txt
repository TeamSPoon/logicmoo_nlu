You're 50, too?  Oh, my God, did you love the Bay City Rollers when you were little!
I totally did!
Me, too! They were me and my friend Wendy's favorite group in elementary school!
Mine, too! Which was your favorite?
Alan!
Ha ha ha!  Mine was Les, of course!
Oh, my God, I couldn't stand his little baby teeth!
Ha ha ha! He did have teeny tiny teeth, didn't he!
Little wee teeth!
Ha ha ha!!!  Did you get 16 Magazine!
Like, every month! And my parents got me a BCR album "only available in Canada" when they went!
The supreme coup!
It was!  My mother was really mad when I put it in a garage sale years later.
Yeah, parents get real sentimental about stuff they get you!
It's true!  What did you think when Ian replaced Woody?
I didn't really like him.
Me, neither.  I remember what his favorite breakfast food was, though!
What?
Eggs benedict!  It's about the only thing I remember from any 16 Magazine article!
Ha ha ha!  Real deep music writing, eh???
