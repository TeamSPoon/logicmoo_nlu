Where would Foo Fighters be without Cobain's suicide?
They would have eventually came together
So you think the band would have broken up?
No but guys do side projects all the time
So it just would have started later than how they are noq
Yeah we would have waited for songs like Monkey Wrench
I think Big Me is a better track in my opinion.
You could think that but I dont know how true it is
I loved the entire album
Grohl was a better front man than he was a drummer.
