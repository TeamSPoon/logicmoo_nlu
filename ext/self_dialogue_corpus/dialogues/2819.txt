How's the Raven's looking so far?
Good! They are rocking the training camp this year.
Right on.
And the schedule looks interesting as well.
How so?
Well, in Pre-Season they face the Bengals, the Browns and the Jags.
Well, lt sounds like a secure 2 out of three wins.
Haha, yeah.
Who's next on the list?
Raiders and Steelers. Those may be a bit harder.
True. But we'll see.
Then there's the Bears, Vikings and Dolphins.
Hmm, that could be another three wins.
More than likely.
Titans, Packers and Texans up next.
Oh, well that could be a problem. Titans and Texans look good this year.
Well, hopefully by then they will be good enuf to beat them.
Hopefully.
Then the roster recycles.... should be routine by then.
It should be a good season.
