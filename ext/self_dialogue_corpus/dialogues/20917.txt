How about we get together and do something?
Sounds good, what would you like to do?
Well I have not watched a good movie in a long time.
I have several movies that you may want to watch.
Great, do you have any funny ones?
I sure do, do you like Bradley Cooper?
I love him! He is not really a comedian though.
No, but he was really funny in the Hangover movies.
Do you have all of those?
I do! Have you watched them?
I have only seen the first one.
Part two and three were even crazier than the original.
Wow, that is hard to imagine!
I actually thought Ed Helms was great in those movies as well.
I agree, although he does not get the credit that he deserves.
That is true. So, are we watching the Hangover two and three?
I think we should! I can not wait.
I think you will love them both if you enjoyed the original.
I hope so; is Melissa McCarthy in one of them?
Yes, she has a small role in part three.
