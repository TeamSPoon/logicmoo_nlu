Is this the last year for the Seahawks to make another run?
Most definitely, Russell and Sherman seem to hate each other.
Sherman seems to hate everyone.
True. Talented player, but a bit of a headcase.
Yeah, and now he's getting older. Seems like he has seen his best days.
I won't count him out, but you may have a point.
I think I do, I think he's a locker room cancer.
Yeah, but they say the defensive players love him.
Yeah, but the offensive players hate him.
So, it's kind of a rough situation.
Yeah, but I will say that the Seahawks are talented this year.
Yep and I think they upgraded their running attack.
That'll be big. They haven't looked the same since Marshawn left.
Beast Mode was a huge loss when he "retired".
Man, I love the way he played, just did not care.
Yep, and he was a funny dude.
I love those types of characters in the NFL.
Not many of them left with how corporate it has become.
That's true, but I hope with them legalizing touchdown celebrations again, it'll change.
Yeah, I agree. Hopefully it'll loosen things up.
