Were you a fan of Proof?
I thought he kept D12 together
I thought the same thing
Lyrically he killed every song he was in
He was also Eminem's hype man on performaces
I think he influenced Em more than we will ever know
I dont know about that, Eminem had Dre
Yeah but Proof was there from the start before he met Dre
His lyrics were mostly mature
Yeah he still mixed it in with the D12 style.
