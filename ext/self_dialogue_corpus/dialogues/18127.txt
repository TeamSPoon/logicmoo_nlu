What's on your headphones?
Old school hip-hop, man.
I love it.  Tupac?
And Biggie......and Tribe, and Nas!
Aww man.  You are naming the greats.
I know.  Tribe has a new album out from last year though.
Cool! But you're listening to thier old hits?
Of course.
Gotta love Award Tour, Electric Relax and Sucka.
Don't forget the song, I lost my wallet in El Segundo!
That's the best, dude.
I got it on super bass too.
Do you remember De La Soul?
Of course.  Breakadawn was my fave!
Yes, they're in my top 3.
I can't remember any more of their hits though.
They recently lost a band member too.
That's sad!
Play it again and let me listen!
Ok, here you go buddy.
