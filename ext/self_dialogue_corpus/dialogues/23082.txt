Hey, have you seen any good movies lately?
Well, I watched something interesting called the Attic Expeditions the other night.
That rings a bell, but I don't think I've seen it.
Yeah, it came out back in 2001 so it's a little older.
Who is in it?
It's got Seth Green and some other people you probably wouldn't recognize, at least I didn't.
Oh Seth Green is a pretty good actor.
Yeah, he's the star in it.  It's definitely a weird movie.
What's it about?
It's about a guy who's in an insane asylum because he killed his girlfriend.  But he starts to question if he's really insane.
Oh I love insane asylum movies!
Yeah, it's a good one.  And there is a sinister director of the asylum who he begins to question.
Are there other interesting patients?
Oh yes, the whole place is quirky and bizarre.  He begins to doubt his whole reality.
That sounds like my kind of movie!  Is the ending good.
Yes, it's definitely interesting.  I think you'd enjoy it.
I like movies that question what is real and what is fantasy.
Yeah, this one definitely makes you think.  And it makes you question mental illness as well.
Good, I will put it on my list to watch.  Seems like Seth Green is getting older!
Yeah, he is.
