Do you know who Jack Black is?
No who is he?
He is a comedic actor. Dark hair, kind of heavy set a bit.
No idea, what was he in?
My favoriate of his was Nacho Libre.

An orphanage, nuns, munks and wrestling.
Sounds a bit eclectic.
Very!
How old is it?
Not that old but on Netflix.
Is it funny?
Very, he is trying to impress a new nun who has come to the orhanage where he lives as a munk.
She is a nun and he is hitting on her?
Well more so trying to impress her so he can hit on her. He really does care about the kids and to be able to by food for them he begins to wrestle.
Like pro wrestling?
Exactly, including a big gold cape.
Do people know?
Only his friend because otherwise he would be intouble and thrown out. That is part of the Chaos of the scenerio.
I will have to look around for it, sounds funny.
