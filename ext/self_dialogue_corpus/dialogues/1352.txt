did you see the Super Bowl last year
most definitely
that was a completely stunning game
I thought it was totally over by half time
yes, watching the Falcons give up that lead was an incredible reversal
I can't stand the patriots, but that was a comeback for the ages!
definitely. say what you want about Tom Brady, but he really does know how to win
I'm definitely not the biggest Brady fan, but I agree that was truly impressive
i would also say that Bill Belichick deserves a lot of credit as well. he kept them in that game
he didn't just keep them in that game, he motivated them to not quit, and gave them a playbook for the turnaround
If I was an Atlanta fan I would have been sick
I was a little sick watching their lead evaporate, and i'm not even a fan
The Falcons had such a high power offense that season, its a shame they couldn't take it all
yes they were putting up huge stats on offense. it wasn't uncommon for multiple RBs to have hundred yard games with multiple touchdowns
yep, but there defense wasn't exactly the best
well compared to the patriots, their defense wasn't as good at all. the Pats defense put in a very solid year
in the end, it helped them pull out the big game as they completely stopped the Falcons after the 3rd quarter
some people are saying that the last super bowl performance cemented Brady as the greatest of all time after that comeback
I think there is a really good case to be made for that
I can't wait til next season starts
