What is your favorite Al Pacino movie?
That's easy, it's Scarface.
That movie is epic.
I love how ruthless the character Tony Montana.
Did you know the got the Montana last name from the quarterback Joe Montana?
Joe Montana from the 49ers?
That's the guy.
Wow, that's interesting.
I have some more Scarface facts if you want to hear them?
Yeah, I'd love to hear them.
Did you know during the epic final shoot out Al Pacino burned his hand on the gun?
How did he do that.
The gun barrel got hot shooting the blanks and he kept his hand on the gun.
That had to hurt.
Oliver Stone was also doing massive amounts of cocaine while he wrote the script.
Didn't him and Brian De Palma go down to Columbia?
Yeah, they went down there and hung out with actual drug lords.
That's some dedication.
I think that's why the movie is so good.  They actually knew what they were doing.
You can tell it.  That movie is scary good.
