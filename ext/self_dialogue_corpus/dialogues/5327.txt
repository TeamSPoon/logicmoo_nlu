Have you seen alladin
I have when I was a kid.
It was one of my favorite movies.
Yes Robin Williams did a really good job in it.
He did the movie for next to nothing.
Really how much?
Only $75000
That's nothing for someone like Williams.
Yes but he didn't do any of the sequels.
I've never seen those.
