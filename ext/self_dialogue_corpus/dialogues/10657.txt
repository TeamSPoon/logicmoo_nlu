who is your favorite Fast & Furious character
for sure it's Dom.
Really? I always like Hobbs better.
no way. Dom is the best!
Hobbs is so much bigger and stronger though.
yeah, but Hobbs wasn't even one of the original characters.
True, but he steals the show in the later sequels
There wouldn't even be a movie without Dom, he's the center of almost all the movies
yeah, except for 2, which he was barely in.
that one was the worst
