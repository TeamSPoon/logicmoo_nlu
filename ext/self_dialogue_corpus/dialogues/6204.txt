Have you ever noticed in Disney films at least one parent is dead.
Not in all of them.
Which ones have both parents.
Mulan, Sleeping Beauty and Tangled, to start.
But in Tangled she was not raised by her parents, just the evil witch lady.
But, they were still alive and she met them later.
That is the same plot, sort of, with Sleeping Beauty?
Yes, her parents did not get to raise her.
Who did?
The fairies, to keep her safe from touching the spindle.
