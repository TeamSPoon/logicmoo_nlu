What is your favorite Disney movie?
I really enjoyed the movie Bambi.
Oh, yes, I thought the scenery in Bambi was so pretty.
Not only was the scenery beautiful, but the characters are so endearing.
Yes, my favorite creature was Thumper the rabbit. What was yours?
My favorite was Flower, the skunk! He was so bashful and sweet.
I was a big fan of The Incredibles because of the whole family, each with their own special talent.
I generally like super hero movies but the one was different because Disney storylines don't usually go there.
The endearing characters whose challenging situations tug at the heartstrings are what makes Disney movies great.
I know I can depend on a Disney movie to entertain my whole family.
