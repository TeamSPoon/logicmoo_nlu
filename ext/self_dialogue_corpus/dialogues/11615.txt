Did you know that there was a different original drummer for the Beatles?
It wasn't always Ringo Starr?
No, it was a guy named Pete Best.
Why did he quit?
I don't know if he quit or was kicked out.
Oh, wow that sucked for him.
Yeah, but it turned out good for Ringo.
What kind of name is Ringo anyway?
His name is actually Richard.
Oh, yeah, I think I read that somewhere.
