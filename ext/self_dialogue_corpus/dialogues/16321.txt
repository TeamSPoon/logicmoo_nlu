What do you think about Mendelssohn?
I think his musical is whimsical.
Have you heard any of his overtures?
Yes, I heard his overture to a midsummer's night dream.
I hear that if you read the play it coincides perfectly.
Yes it really does, it's amazing.
I have played his piano concerto in G minor.
That piece of virtuosity was a favorite among Franz Liszt.
I have to keep it in my fingers.
I think it also demonstrates his whimsical character.
Have you heard any of his art songs?
He did not write much.
Yes, his sister actually composed more than he did in that genre.
A lot of people attribute many of his works to his sister.
I think they were both geniuses.
They had a similar yet different style.
Something about her music is a bit more edgy and modern.
She was a woman during those times so who knows who did what in it's entirety.
It's unfortunate they both died so young.
Yes as was the plight of many composers.
