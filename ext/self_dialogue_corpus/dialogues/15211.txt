I've been really into listening to Madonna again lately.
She is a bit underappreciated lately.
I know. I mean, I know her older stuff is still pretty popular, but her newer work should get more attention.
Well, it's not all good.
True. The last album could have been trimmed of a few songs, but most of it was pretty great.
Yeah. Dance music in general always has a tough time in the US though.
It's true, every time it seems like it's starting to really break through, it sort of fades away again.
It did seem like it was having a moment there. Seems to be all back to rap now though.
Mostly. Though there are still some acts that crack the charts.
The Chainsmokers have been doing pretty well for themselves. And Zedd and Kygo have managed some minor hits recently.
Unfortunately, they all border more on pop than real dance music.
At least the radio hits do anyway.
Well, The Chainsmokers especially don't really make what I would call dance music, it's very pop.
True, though the same could be said for Madonna.
She is definitely a pop act, but much her output is far dancier than The Chainsmokers.
That could be what's been hurting her though.
That is what I was getting at eariler.
Well it is what it is. Things don't need to be hits to be able to enjoy them.
No, I suppose not.
If that were the case no one would even listen to rock music anymore.
