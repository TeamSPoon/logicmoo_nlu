What did you think about the Anikan sand quote?
It was cheesy
I think I knew what he was going for. But it was cringy
That might have been the idea
Anakin struggled with love
Yeah
It's not surprising that he would focus on the physical part of a woman he likes
Padme was also an important person
It made sense that they fell in love
Anyone would if they were in hiding like that
