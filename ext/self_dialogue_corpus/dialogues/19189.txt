who do you think has a unique voice in Music?
Well obviously Bjork.
Oh totally.She sounds like no other.
Also unique taste in fashion, recall the swan dress?
Yes, I actually thought that would make a great halloween costume.
It has been done but would still be a good one.
I think joanna newsom also has a very different voice.
Yes it is also very quirky sounding.
Have you heard the song peach plum pear?
I don't think I know that one.
I think that is my favorite newsom song.
I like Sawdust And Diamonds .
That is a good one. She is such a different artist.
I am impressed she plays the harp.
YA no kidding that is such an incredibly difficult instrument to master.
The accoridan is also difficult to play.
Does she play it too?
I don't think so, I was just saying it is also very hard to master.
Joanna is probably a closet accordion player . lol.
Who knows what she would keep in her closet.  A thousand fairies making her music?
