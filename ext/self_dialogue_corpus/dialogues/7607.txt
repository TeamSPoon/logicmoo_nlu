Have you seen any of the Harry Potter movies?
No I haven't.
Really, that is so odd. Most people have.
Ya, I just ever got around to it. What are they about anyways.
They are about a boy who finds out he is a wizard and ends up having to attend school at Hogwarts.
Oh. Who is in them.
They all have a lot of the same characters. One of them is Daniel Radcliffe and another is Emma Watson.
Oh, I like them.
Ya, you probably watch them grow up on screen.
Oh, thats cool.
