Have you seen the movie Split?
No, I haven't had the chance yet, but I'm looking forward to it. I've heard some good things about it.
It's quite creepy, and James McAvoy does such an excellent job with portraying his character.
Oh, you mean with all the versions of his character?
Yeah, of course. I just didn't want to include any spoilers for you.
Don't worry. I already heard about him portraying a character with 23 different personalities.
Actually, in the end there were 24. How's that for a little spoiler?
That's interesting. Even more excited to see it now.
The rest of the actors do a really good job as well. Especially Anya Taylor-Joy in the role of Casey Cooke.
I'm not too familiar with her actually. It will be interesting to discover some new talent.
