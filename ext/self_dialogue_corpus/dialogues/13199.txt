I'm so glad we're doing a Star Wars movie night!
I am too. Are we just starting from the beginning?
I've never just watched them all the way through. I thought Phantom Menace would be a good place to start.
It's not my favorite, but I think it could be fun.
Why not?
I just never cared for Jar-jar.
Well, you can go get us snacks during those parts!
That's true. What's a good snack to eat while watching Star Wars.
Popcorn, obviously.
You set up the movie, and I'll go pop some!
