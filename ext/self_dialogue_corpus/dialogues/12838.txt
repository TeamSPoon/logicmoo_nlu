Did you enjoy Star Wars the Force Awakens?
I loved it.
What was your favorite part?
It had to be the battle at the end where Kylo and Rey battle.
That was a good scene, do you think they nailed it?
I do, I loved the interaction of the characters and how the ground was constantly shifting it made it exciting.
Plus it fleshed out their characters a bit more and made us feel more connected with them.
They did a great job at making people we don't know part of us quickly.
That was something I worried about was why should I care about these people.
They did a good job.
