I hate how everything has to be a cinematic universe now.
Me too. I blame Marvel.
I guess in a way it's their fault since they were the first to do it, but it's hard to blame them for being successful.
It doesn't matter if this is what they wanted to happen or not. Their success lead everyone to copy them, ergo, it's their fault.
Maybe. I don't know, but I do know that some franchises just don't need cinematic universes.
Like what?
Like, take The Mummy for example. The new one, not the Brendan Fraser movie.
Oh, I remember them advertising as something like "The start of a Dark Universe"? Something like that.
Right, right. From the start the movie was basically supposed to kick off a monster universe.
So if it was successful, we'd get stuff like Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man, but, you know, in color this time.
Sort of. Despite having the original cinematic universe back, Universal Pictures has no idea how make one now.
Oh yeah, they had a few of those films where monsters would meet each other. Like Dracula and Frankenstein would be in the same film together.
And now they want to do it again, to chase that sweet, sweet Marvel money, but they don't know what they're doing.
Well, The Mummy basically bombing, does that mean this is the end of their ambitions?
Probably not. Dracula Untold was supposed to be the start of a cinematic universe too, before it bombed.
You think they'll try again?
Did DC stop when Green Lantern failed?
I suppose not.
See, they'll just keep trying over and over, until somehow they get it right.
Or go bankrupt in the process!
