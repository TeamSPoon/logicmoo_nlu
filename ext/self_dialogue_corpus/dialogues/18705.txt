Have you seen Lynyrd Skynyrd?
No I have not.
I saw them in 1977 before the plane wreck.
Really?
Yeah it was with another band, that only played a few songs.
What? Why?
The band had technical difficulties and just walked off.
Wow.
Yeah, Then Lynyrd Skynyrd came out and played their asses off.
Cool.
Towards the end they turned around and played a song to the people in back of the stage.
Right on, why?
The next song was Free Bird and they dropped the Confederate flag. The people went crazy.
I would have liked to seen that.
The concert people wanted the concert to end so the turned on the lights. People were yelling and stomping so lout I thought the place was going to crumble.
Was it scary?
No we just wanted more, Then they came back out with lights on and played some more, finally the lights went off.
Wow. concerts were crazy back then.
Not really crazy, just loud and fun.
Cool.
