So I was in my car driving last night and that Bad Romance song came on.
Okay.  What'd you think?
That song is kind of trippy.  It's late at night, you're by yourself...
Trippy?  It's not that creepy.
The way she sings it is kind of nuts.
Just because it sounds kind of electronic?
It's just that they made her deep voice even deeper.
And that gives you the creeps?
I'm just saying, the chorus made me creeped out.
You've got some serious issues, my man.
