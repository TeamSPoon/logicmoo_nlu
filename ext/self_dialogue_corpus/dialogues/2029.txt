Hey lets talk football. I want to see what your thoughts are on the upcoming season.
Yeah I can't wait to get back to pigskin football again.
What are your thoughts on the Falcons this year and if they can bounce back from that collapse in the Super Bowl?
I think they shoud be fine and it was just inexperience which caused for the game to go the wrong way for the Falcons.
I think they should be able to make it back to the playoffs again. Matt Ryan is an elite quarterback in my mind and should be more experienced this time around.
Talking about elite quarterbacks, your thoughts on the other big name ones in the NFL?
I think Joe Flacco will have a breakout year for the Ravens, and Andrew Luck will finally get what he needs and gets further into the playoffs
I think thats saying a whole lot, as these guys are great quarterbacks, but their teams as a whole aren't talented enough to move deep in the playoffs.
What are your surprise teams this year?
I think Jacksonville should be a contender, same with the Tennessee Titans and Tampa Bay.
Tampa is definitely talented. Jameis has the tools to win, and I think Doug Martin will have a bounceback season.
Who are your surprise teams this year?
I really do like Washington this year, as well as Tennessee.
What do you like about either team?
Washington has the talent, just not the chemistry which defiitely can cause problems.
Yep, big egos between teammates never workout in the end.
I also do believe that Johnny Manziel will be back in the NFL and be a decisive playmaker.
The kid definitely has talent and looks to be a safe spot for whoever decides to roll the dice on him.
I don't think its beneficial for anyone to get Johnny Manziel
Yeah you are right
