Has Johnny Depp been in any good horror movies?
Yeah, he has been in a lot. He got his start in A Nightmare on Elm Street.
Which is his best one?
In my opinion, probably Sleepy Hollow, the Tim Burton one.
I just hated Dark Shadows, though. Or most Tim Burton movies lately.
Sleepy Hollow is also one of Tim Burton's better movies!
How does it compare to Beetlejuice?
It is not as good, and maybe not as creepy.
Give me a good reason to watch Sleepy Hollow.
Christopher Walken plays one of the scariest movie villains of all time in it.
