Are you going to see The House this month?
Is that the movie with Ferrell?
Yeah! It looks decent.
Yeah, it looks like it could be worth the price of admission.
There hasn't been many good comedies lately.
I agree. Can't even remember the last decent one I saw.
I saw that sisters one with Poehler and Fey.
That was alright. Kind of cheesy.
What movies aren't these days?
You got a point there.
