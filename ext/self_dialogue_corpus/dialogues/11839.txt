You know what song is always beautiful to me?
What song?
'Eleanor Rigby.'
There was definitely such a unique quality about that one.
Did you know that it was one of the first songs by them that isn't sang in a first person perspective?
Now that you mention it, there were no "I's" or "me's" in that song at all.  At least not that I can recall.
It also really resonated with me.  And so many others.
I could definitely also relate to that sort of loneliness they sang about.
Exactly.  Sad, but also universal concepts.
That gave it depth and made it all the more beautiful, like you said earlier.
