I love Lady Gg's music, don't you?
Yup! Have you bought any of it?
Yeah I have her .mp3 albums.
If you get her albums on CD, don't get them from Walmart.
I'd never go there anyway, but why shouldn't I?
They censored her music.
Yeah, Walmart censors their music to go with their "family-friendly" status.
I wish I had known that at the time. "Bad Romance" isn't the same with certain words deleted.
Ha! Well you can also not buy a CD anymore. It's 2017.
At least her music rocks, all of her songs.
