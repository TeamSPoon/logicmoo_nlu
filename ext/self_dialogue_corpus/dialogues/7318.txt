Did you know that Disney is going to put out a live-action version of Mulan?
Yeah, I heard! Who do you think they'll cast as Mulan?
I have no idea. I hope they bring Eddie Murphy back to voice Mushu though.
Agreed!
I'm really looking forward to the battle scenes.
Same! It'll definitely be different from Cinderella and Beauty and the Beast.
I've heard Disney is going to do a live-action version of Aladdin as well.
Awesome! I'd love to see Zayn Malik portray Aladdin.
Why? He can sing, but he only has one facial expression: the smolder.
True. They'll have to cast someone new, I think.
