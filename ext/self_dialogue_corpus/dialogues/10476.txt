Hello! Long time no see!
Hey man, it's been awhile!
You done anything cool lately?
Well, I don't know how cool it is, but I saw a great movie last night.
Which one, maybe I've seen it?
Um, Hidden Figures?
Oh yes! That movie should have won the Oscars it was nominated for, it was fantastic.
Wasn't it great? I thought it was super well done.
The scripting and the casting was fantastic.
That scene where Katherine chews out her coworkers for having to run across campus was so good.
Yeah. I know it was based on a true story, so I wonder if that was true.
Her running across town? Yeah, I know that part was.
No, I meant that the coworkers actually listened and changed.
Oh. Yeah, I don't know about that.
It just makes me so mad to think about the fact that they even made the coffee part different for "coloreds."
Racism is messed up, man.
I'm glad that movie was made. It did a good job of recognizing those people.
We've white washed a lot of history, unfortunately.
Well, hopefully the actors will get more roles after this, I enjoyed all of them.
Taraji especially was amazing.
