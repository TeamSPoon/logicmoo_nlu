Do you like Lady Gaga?
Yes, I love her. She is an amazing performer.
I know! What is your favorite song by her?
Probably Just Dance. It was the first Gaga song I ever heard.
That's a good one. I like the one she did with Beyonce.
Telephone? That one is awesome.
I can't believe she wore that meat suit to an awards show.
I know. She is outrageous.
Have you heard any of the songs she did with Tony Bennett?
Yes. That was very cool that she did that.
