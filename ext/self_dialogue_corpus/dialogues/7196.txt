The new Beauty and the Beast movie did well in the box office.
Yeah, it was good!
They had new songs that weren't in the animated version though.  Why was that?
I think the Broadway vesion had those new songs.
Oh really?
I'm not sure.  That's what I heard.
I didn't mind the new songs.  I just wasn't expecting them.
Did you like Emma Watson as Belle?
Yeah, she is a good actress and seemed to portray Belle the way she was meant to be portrayed.
Yeah, she was independent and strong-willed but also kind.
