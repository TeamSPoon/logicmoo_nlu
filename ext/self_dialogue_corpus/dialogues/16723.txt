So, I need your help since you're big into music and all.
Okay, what you got going?
I'm doing a slideshow movie featuring all the pictures I took of my students this year.
Oh, cool!  That's awesome!
Yeah, it is.  Buuut, I'd like to put it to some music, need about five or six songs that would be good for it.
Okay, I can do that.
Keep in mind these are kindergarteners, so it has to be FAMILY friendly music!
Yeah, I can still do that.  Think I can even get you a variety of songs.
Alright, list a couple.
Well, let's see.. you can always do Walk the Moon's "Shut Up and Dance"
Oh, I yeah, that's a good one!
And, of course, the girls would probably like it if you put a bit of "Let It Go" from the Frozen soundtrack.
Yeah, not sure the PARENTS will like it much though.
HAHA!  Also, Rusted Root's "Send Me On My Way" would be a good one.
Why does that sound familiar?
It was on the first Ice Age movie.
Oh yeah!  Anything else?
Let's see... if you don't mind going old school, you could do "Living On a Prayer" or even "It's My Life" by Bon Jovi.
Alright those are possible.
Also, I'd put in "Can't Behave" by Courtney Jayne.
