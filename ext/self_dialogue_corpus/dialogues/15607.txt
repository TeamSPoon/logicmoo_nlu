Hey have you listened to Damn yet?
No, who's that by?
Kendrick Lamar
Oh I love him, I didn't know he released a new album
It's so good, album of the year so far in my opinion
Really? Why's that?
There's not a single bad song on the album, and the features are great
Who are the features?
U2, Rihanna, and Zacari
That's an interesting mix, I'll check it out
I think you'll love it
Is it anything like his past stuff?
Yeah, I'd say it's less lyrical but the beats are much better
Better than "To Pimp a Butterfly"
Yeah, I think it's better but that's a great album too
How does it stack up against stuff like J. Cole's newest album?
I like it much better, but I also thought Cole's album was kinda boring
You know he wrote that album about his daughter, right?
Yeah I know, it just doesn't really do it for me
To each their own I guess
