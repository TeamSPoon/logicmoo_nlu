The Dark Tower is coming out soon.
That is based upon the Steven King novel right?
Yes, I read it when I was a kid.
Fans have been waiting a long time for this movie adaptation.
It should be good as Idris Elba plays the main character.
I remember him from The Wire.
He is actually a British actor but he plays those American roles very well.
When is the movie due to release?
August 4th of this year.
I'll set the date to go to the theater.
