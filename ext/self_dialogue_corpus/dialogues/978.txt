So who is your favorite NFL team these days?
You know I love my Cincinnati Bengals!
I know, that makes me feel sorry for you!
Whatever, I think we have a very bright future ahead of us!
Not until management finally decides to fire Marvin Lewis you don't.
I do not think that is fair, he has gotten us to the playoffs year after year.
That s true, however, he is 0-7 when he gets to the playoffs!
Trust me, I know all about his lack of playoff success.
I feel like getting to the playoffs is a nice accomplishment; but at some point you have to win a couple, right?
I know, I just feel like at some point he will break through and make a nice run.
Well, he has had very talented teams over the years and still come up empty in the playoff win column.
I feel like some of the blame has to fall on the quarterback position as well.
I am not sure about that, Andy Dalton is actually pretty good.
He is, but I feel like he could be more consistent throughout the season.
He played his college football at TCU and even won a Rose Bowl.
What does that have to do with anything?
It just shows that he can lead a winning program to great post season success.
I get what you are saying, hopefully he can rack up some playoff wins before his career is over.
Well, he has got one of the best receivers in the game to help him along.
That is true! I think we will be be much better in the future.
