So what do you think about all the new Star Wars movies?
I don't know if I'm a fan.  I'm a bit of a purist.
Me too.  I grew up with the original Star Wars three, and I'm not all that interested in the new franchise.
Yeah, neither am I.  What was your favorite of the first three?
I would have to say The Empire Strikes Back.  I am a big fan of Harrison Ford as Han Solo, and the newer movies just don't have the same panache.
Yeah, I really liked Carrie Fisher as Princess Leia and Mark Hamill as Luke Skywalker.  The newer actors don't have as much appeal.
I had a Princess Leia doll from the original Star Wars movie.  She looked just like the character in the movie.
That is so cool.  Do you still have it?  I had some smaller action figures.
Yes, I do.  It probably isn't worth much though because I played with it a lot.
I think I need to introduce the original 3 Star Wars movies to my own kids.  You just can't beat the Cantina Band and Boba Fett.
