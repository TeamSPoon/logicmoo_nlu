When did Batman begin I wonder.
Batman began around the same time in 1939. Also as a comic book.
Did you know Batman made appearances in the Adventures of Superman?
Yes, the original crossovers. There might be older example of crossovers, but I'm not aware of it.
That must have been so cool to be a fan of both and watch them cross over.
Yeah, but Batman movie serials don't come out until 1943, and guess what the plot was?
What?
About a secret Japanese sabotage ring in the Gotham city. it was after the Pearl Harbor attacks
That's so timely.
And makes it more relatable for the audience.
