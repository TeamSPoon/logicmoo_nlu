Do you think Ursula was really bad?
Yes! She was the villiain of the whole film.
I suppose that is true, I just always felt sympathy for her plight.
Just because you felt badly for her does not make her a saint.
True, I just did not see her as evil as I guess she was.
She was evil, she tricks Ariel to gain rulership of the sea.
I am not saying she did not do some bad things. I suppose I just need to admit she is evil.
Yes, yes you do. You can still enjoy her, I do.
I will always enjo ursula. She had some great numbers. Think I just wanted to make her out to be not so bad.
We are what we are. She is a villiain with a good voice.
