Hey, how's everything going?
Pretty good, what's up with you?
Oh nothing much, just hanging out
Done anything cool lately
Not really, but I'm looking forward to seeing the new Wonder Woman movie
Really? Why would you want to see that?
Well, I like super hero movies and this one has really good reviews
No way! A super hero movie with good reviews?!
Yes way. Look it up on Rotten Tomatoes.
Okay, I'll trust your story. Any idea why it's so good.
No, that's why I want to see it.
Any big stars in it?
Chris Pine and Gal Godot
I don't recognize those names
Chris Pine was in Star Trek
Oh yeah, I remember him
And Gal Godot was in the Fast and Furious
Hmmm...still not ringing any bells
Well, go check it out
Okay, maybe I will
