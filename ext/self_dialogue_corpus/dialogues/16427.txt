Have you heard the new Harry Stules album?
His solo one?
Yes! It's so good.
Really?? I don't like One Direction.
No, it's so different, I swear.
What kind of music is it?
It's like classic British rock. I was so stunned.
That's hard to imagine.
I know, but trust me.
OK I will have to give it a go.
Listen to Kiwi and Only Angel and tell me what you think.
Ok, are those the best on the album?
Well, they are the most rock. He has some slow stuff that's alright, but I liked these best.
Ok, any slow stuff good?
Sign of the Times was decent. Reminds me of  Bowie.
Cool. I think I heard that one.
Yeah I believe that was his first single.
Yeah it's been on the radio.
Yeah the ones I gave you sound like the Clash and Rolling Stones
Cool, I'm going to listen now.
