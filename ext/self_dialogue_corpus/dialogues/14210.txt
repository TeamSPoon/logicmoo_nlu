Are you going to get to see Lady Gaga on tour this summer?
Yes, I hate to wait until August though.
Where are you going to see her?
My boyfriend and I are going to Vegas for her August 11th show.
She's such an interesting artist. Seems like she's always changing her look.
I know, right?  Her costumes are crazy.
Did you see her with James Corden on Carpool Karaoke?
Yes, I love his carpools. He was good with Gaga.
I love her with Tony Bennett too.
Same. Shows you what a talent she really is.
