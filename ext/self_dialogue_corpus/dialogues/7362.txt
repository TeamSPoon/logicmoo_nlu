The Little Mermaid was not a very good movie.
Why do you say that? I loved that one.
Yeah it was okay I guess, but I just didn't like the villain.
You mean that giant octopus lady? Why didn't you like her?
She wasn't scary enough to be a villian for me.
Are you kidding? She was horrifying!
Well I don't think anyone was so terrifying as the villian from The Lion King, Scar.
Oh yeah you're right. Scar was a really bad dude.
Yeah Scar actually got Simba's dad killed.
Maybe I'm starting to agree with you on this whole octopus lady thing. Haha.
