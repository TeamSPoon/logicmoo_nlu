Do you have a favorite comedy movie?
I really love Father of the Bride.
Wow that's an old movie.
Yeah, but I love Steve Martin. He is a classy kind of funny.
That's true. The comedy movies today are so dirty it's almost not even funny.
Well there is nothing dirty in that movie, him and martin short are hilarious.
I think I've seen that one. That is where the wife and daughter get pregnant at the same time, right?
It sure is. I really love when Steve Martin takes those pills and he passes out at the table.
Yeah and then Martin Short tries to walk with him on his back and he slowly sinks to the floor.
Martin Short's accent is hilarious. I really love that movie.
