Who is your favorite evil guy in Star Wars?
Obviously Darth Vader is the best and the original bad guy of Star Wars.
Yeah but did you know that he was supposed to be killed off in the first movie?
I can't imagine the movies without him. His voice and costume is so iconic.
Yeah but he is only on screen for like 12 minutes in the first movie, even though he is pretty much a main character.
I just learned that they guy doing the voice isn't the same guy that is actually doing the acting.
James Earl Jones does the voice, even though he isn't listed in the credits. David Prowse did the acting.
His voice was perfect for that role!  He also did Mufasa in the Lion King.
Even though they played the same character, David and Earl never actually met eachother.
That would be so weird to be playing the same person but never meet the other half.
