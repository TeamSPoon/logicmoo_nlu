Why so much hatered toward the Patriots.
I am tired of Tom Brady and Bill Bellichek
I really want to see the Steelers Patriots game.

The Steelers play them on December 17,2017 at 3:25.
I would love to see that game.
I know your a die hard Steelers fan.
Definatly my whole family grew up in Pittsburgh and loving the Steelers.
We should go see the steelers and Patriots game together.
Sure only if we sit in my Steelers section.
