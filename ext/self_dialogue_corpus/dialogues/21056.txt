Which of the James Bond films have you yet to see?
I think I've seen them all already.
Yeah same here, which did you think were particularly good?
I like the new Daniel Craig ones, I like the gritty nature of them.
Don't they feel a bit too American? Maybe a bit too Jason Bourne?
No, I think it's just changing with the times like the others have.
You mean like the camp comedy ones and the Cold War ones.
Yeah that's it. I'm not a huge fan of some of them.
The Lazenby one was a bit ridiculous.
Not only ridiculous, it was poorly made. I know they didn't have great graphics but it looked like a child's computer game!
Yeah, not all the old ones were bad though. I enjoyed Live and Let Die and Dr. NO.
They were good, they can't compete with the modern ones in terms of looks but the story is just as good.
Goldeneye was quite good for a laugh too.
It was, I'm not a huge fan of Brosnan though.
He was OK but not the greatest.
Top Bonds then?
I'd say Connery, Craig and Roger Moore.
I disagree on Roger Moore.
He's the funny one, you don't have to like the action but you can laugh at him.
We can agree on that.
