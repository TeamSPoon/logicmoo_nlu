What is your favorite Disney movie?
'Mulan'
Yes!  That is mine too.
I remember liking everything about it as a child.
Likewise.  It was so empowering to young girls.
Yea, Mulan was so strong and determined.  I also liked that 'Mulan' represented elements of Asian culture.
Did you know that Ming-Na Wen was the voice of Mulan?
Oh no way, she's such a great actress.
What was your favorite song in the movie?
I really enjoyed "I'll Make a Man Out of You."  That song really builds.
I listen to it at the gym all the time.  I get chills during the training montage scene.
How about you.  What was your favorite?
I liked "Reflection."
Another classic!
That whole scene is so emotional.  It gets me every time.
Do you know Ming Na Wen sang for that role?
No, I believe during singing portions of the movie, they have a singer do it instead.
Ah okay, that makes a lot of sense.  They picked singers who sound very much like the actors though, I could barely tell.
Have you seen the sequel?
I didn't even realize 'Mulan' had a sequel.  Maybe I'll give it a watch.
