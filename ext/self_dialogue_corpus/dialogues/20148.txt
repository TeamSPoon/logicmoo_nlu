Did you see that they finally made a Tupac movie?
I know!  I'm so excited to see it!
Me too!  Did you notice when it came out?
On a Friday?  What do you mean?
It wasn't just any Friday - it was his birthday.
No, I didn't notice that.
Yep, June 16th.
That guy they cast really looks like him a lot.
Yeah, they did a really good job with that.
But I heard he wore a cap for the movie.
What do you mean, a cap? Like a baseball cap?
No, I mean like, to cover his hair.
But Tupac was bald.
Yeah, exactly.  Instead of shaving his head for the movie, the actor wore one of those bald caps.
Seriously?  That's odd.  I mean, did he have really great hair?
Hahaha, no.  I'm pretty sure he just has regular hair, nothing special.
Wow, he looks good for the role, but that's a lack of commitment.
Yeah, you'd think it wouldn't be much for him to just shave his own head.
True.  Well it isn't going to change anything for me- I'm still going to see the movie as soon as I have time.
Me too- let me know when you're going maybe we can meet up for it.
