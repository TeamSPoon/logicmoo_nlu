Do you like Andrew Luck?
I think he's alright.
He's my favorite player.
Really, that's interesting.  Why?
Even as a rookie he proved himself to be able to play with the best.
He did do very well from the start.
You just don't see that anymore.
I agree new quarterbacks are always questionable.
Do you think he will be as good as Peyton Manning?
I don't know that's a tough one, Peyton is one of the best ever.
That's true I just like him and hope so.
He is pretty good already.
Do you think he will be able to get MVP at some point?
I don't think anytime soon with Peyton and Brady still playing.
Don't forget about Rodgers as well.
Do you think he will ever break any records?
I think he's already broken some of the rookie ones.
I mean all time records.
That's interesting, I think so eventually.
Yeah, maybe.
