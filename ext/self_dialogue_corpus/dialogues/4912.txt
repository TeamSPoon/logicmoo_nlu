Who do you think the front runners for the World Series are this year?
Well, I think obviously you have to start with the two teams that were in it last year, the Cubs and the Indians.
But both of them are struggling a bit right now, and other teams are surging.
Well, yes they aren't leading either of their perspective leagues, but I think they are still frontrunners.
Why do you think that is?
I think the Indians are a little banged up, and coming off a long year, and they are still in the lead of their division.
What about the Cubs?
The Cubs still have one of the most dangerous and young lineups in Baseball.
Yeah, but they don't have great starting pitching and their bullpen is not great.
That is true, but they can always go and get someone at the deadline.
What about Encarnacion not playing well?
He has traditionally gotten off to slow starts, but I think he will pick up where he left off last year. Who do you like?
Well, I think that the Yankees are a year ahead of schedule and they are young and powerful lineup that can really do damage.
You think the Cubs pitching staff is bad, but you are okay with the staff of the Yankees.
Of course not, just like Cubs, their starting pitching is pretty bad. But they have a lot of ammunition for midseason trades.
That is true, they do have a lot of young talent, but will they be willing to part with it, for rental players?
I think they will move some pieces.
What about in the National League, anyone you like?
Other than the Cubs, I guess the Dodgers would be the favorite. Best pitcher in baseball and also that lineup.
Yes the Dodgers are always a threat to win it all.
