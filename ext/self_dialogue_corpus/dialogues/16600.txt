What's your favorite kind of music?
I really like alternative. What about you?
I like alternative rock too.
What do you think about Foo Fighters?
I love Foo Fighters. Dave Grohl is awesome.
Yeah, he is. Did you like Nirvana too?
Absolutely. Kurt Cobain is a genius.
I agree. Do you listen to any other styles of music?
I like almost everything. Are there any genres you don't like?
I don't like jazz.
What don't you like about jazz?
It just sounds like noise to me.It makes my head hurt.
I can understand that. I feel that way about a lot of rap music too.
Yeah, I'm not a big fan of rap myself.
What do you think about country music?
I could give or take it. Not a huge fan, but I don't hate it.
Some of it is just horrible, but I don't mind a few artists.
Do you prefer the older or the newer country music artists?
Newer, generally. I think a lot of it sounds the same though.
Me too, I agree.
