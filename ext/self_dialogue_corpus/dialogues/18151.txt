Have you ever heard of Travis Greene?
Yes. He sings that song Intentional.
Yes. So you have heard of him.
He went to the presidential inauguration back here in January.
He sure did. Did you watch it on TV?
I watched because I wanted to see Travis Greene sing Intentional.
He did a good job. He represented good.
His back up was good also.
I like Intentional but I love He Made A Way!!!
That's a good one also.
Girl, that's one of my favorite songs.
Do you have the CD?
Yes. I got the CD after I heard the song the first time.
You must have really liked it!
You got that right. It was love at first hearing.
I haven't heard it enough to know if I like it or not.
I love the words in the song. They touch some situations I'm going through.
I'll check it out again. I't on my MP3 player.
You do that. Let me know if you like it or not.
I sure will. I'm open to more good music.
