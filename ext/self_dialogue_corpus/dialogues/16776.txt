What kind of music are you in to?
Kind of an embarrassing topic, to be honest.
Why?
Well, I only really listen to heavy metal.
Ah. Yeah, I don't know anyone into that kind of stuff.
I have a couple friends who do, bu most don't and we just don't talka bout music.
Like who's your favorite artist?
In history?
Yeah sure.
Probably Metallica.
I wouldn't really consider them heavy metal, they have a pretty huge fan base.
Yeah, you're right.
Did you see the show a few weeks ago at Gillette Stadium?
I did actually! I'm surprised you knew about it!
C'mon, you don't have to be a metal fan to know Metallica!
True, but a lot of other bands a like are kind of strict to the genre.
Try me, I bet I've heard of them!
Well... Meshuggah is another fave.
You have lost me there.
I figured!
