Have you ever seen Mulun?
The Disney movie?
Yes, that one.
No, but I really need to. I am obsessed with Donny Osmond and he has a role in it.
Plus he sings.
Oh, that voice of his!
Didn't people used to tease you about your Donny obsession?
Yes, and I couldn't care less! He is so talented  and cute.
Let's watch it together over the weekend.
It's a date!
