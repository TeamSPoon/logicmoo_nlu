Ever seen Anchorman?
Yeah, I saw the first one wasn't there a new one recently?
By recent it was in two thousand and thirteen then sure.
You know what I meant! Is it any good?
Yeah, it's not as comparable to the original but at least they still have Will Ferrell as Ron.
I loved his character, probably one of his best movies was the original.
The second one is still amazing though, it has great reviews.
Oh, I'll try to see it, anything bad in the movie that I should be worried about?
Nothing more than the first, there's drugs and some suggestive and vulgar language but other than that it's fine.
What's the rating though?
It's rated PG-13 so don't worry about that, it's not THAT nasty.
Oh, good do you want to watch it too soon?
Sure, I loved it, Will really nailed the character with him and he fits it so perfectly.
I sure hope so, how long is the movie?
It's about 2 hours long.
Is it filled with the randomness that is Will Ferrell?
Of course, it goes off on a tangent a lot but it's hilarious. At then end it's a classic western with a final showdown.
Shh! Don't spoil it now, I haven't seen it remember?
Yeah, but let's watch it now.
Sure!
