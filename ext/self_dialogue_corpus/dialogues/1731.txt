Which NFL team do you think has the best defense in the league?
After last season, it's really hard to choose between the Patriots, Broncos, and Vikings
If the Vikings had kept going on their path, they could have swept the league
They had such a strong start, I wonder what happened to them?
I don't know, but they say defense wins championships, and they didn't even make the playoffs
Well the Patriots defense was ranked much higher than the Falcons defense, so I suppose that makes sense
I think the Texans had the best defense statistically, even though they played only average
It really depends on the strength of a team's schedule, otherwise the numbers don't mean a whole lot
The Broncos did well enough considering they lost Peyton Manning
He shouldn't have been that much of a factor since the defense carrie the team all the way to the Superbowl
Then what about the Seahawks defense? Better than the Broncos defense or not?
I think they're better as a whole, but both teams are lopsided on offense and defense that it doesn't matter
Balance is definitely a huge factor in the league, which is why the Falcons lack of a strong defense cost them so dearly
I don't think their defense was that bad, but then they did give up almost 30 points late in the game
So consistency is more important, since a lot of games are won and lost in the final minutes
I definitely like to see a game played at its fullest to the final whistle
Andew Luck is a great quarterback who has a knack for making late game-winning comebacks
So is Matthew Stafford, although you wouldn't know it by the Lions' record the last few seasons
Remember when they made the playoffs only to lose to the Cowboys in the first game?
That was one of the most disappointing games I've watched, and I hope Matthew Stafford takes the team all the way next season
