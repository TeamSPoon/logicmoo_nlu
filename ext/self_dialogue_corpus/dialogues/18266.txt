Did you study music in school?
Yes, we had chorus, band, and orchestra.
Were you involved in any of those groups?
Chorus was required until 9th grade and I was in band.
Do you remember what music you played or sang?
Oh yes, the music is still vivid today.
What do you mean?
I don't forgot too many songs that I played or sang.
Really?
I can still picture myself and class singing, "Good Morning Miss Astin!"
Wow, what grade was that in?
That was in elementary school!
Tell me more.
I also remember singing a song called, "Goober Peas."
That's an odd title.
Yeah, I bet it had some more meaning to it but it definately stood out.
I guess so.  Did you have a favorite song?
Yeah, I always liked the Battle Hymn of the Republic.
That is amazing.
I don't know what I'd do without music.
