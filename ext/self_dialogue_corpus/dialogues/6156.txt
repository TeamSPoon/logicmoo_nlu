Did you hear about all the new Disney movies based on animated films?
Other than Beauty and the Beast?
That was the most recent, but they announced quite a few new ones coming soon. Think 22 give or take.
Like what?
Off the top of my head... Aladdin which I'm most psyched about, Mulan, Cuella, Peter Pan, The Sword in the Stone, Chip n Dale, Maleficent 2, and Jungle Book 2.
Nice to see Hollywood is still out of fresh ideas.
Hey! Normally I'd agree with you, but even though they're based on their animated counterparts they've done a beautiful job bringing them to life and giving a complete modern reimagining to them.
I guess you're right, and I did thoroughly enjoy The Jungle Book with Bill Murray, Ben Kingsley, and Idris Elba. Absolutely lost it when King Louie busted out into one of my favorite Disney songs.
Oh, oobee doo! I wanna be like you!
I wanna walk like you! Talk like you, too!
