Do you think the Dolphins will turn the corner?
No I think Tannehill is an average quarterback
Do you think Adam Gase will get canned this year?
No he has some latitude with that
In what respect?
He has won alot of games with them with for no good reason
Oh ok so will anyone challenge the Patriots?
This year?
Yeah.
No I think Bills have the best chance
I dont even think they have a legit starter
Yes they do
Tyrod Taylor is not a real quarterback
Yeah he is, he shown he can handle it
Rex Ryan set them back for years.
I dont think thats true.
Just watch, they wont be good for another decade.
They havent been good in a decade
The Jets have the best shot at unseating the Pats.
Yeah but its so slim.
