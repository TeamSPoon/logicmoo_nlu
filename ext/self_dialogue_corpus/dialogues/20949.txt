So I just watched a Nightmare on Elm Street movie-
Love that franchise.
Yeah it's pretty great but the one I saw was Craven's New Nightmare one that came out in the 90's-?
Oh man, I LOVED that one!
It was genuinely good. Really meta, you know?
Yeah, like a precursor to Scream.
Yeah both of those films were so self-aware but still super scary, in my opinion.
The 'skin you like a cat' part of the Nightmare movie scarred me as a kid. Scream didn't really scar me though.
No, yeah. Just gave me a crush on Matthew Lillard.
YES! Did you know Matthew Lillard ad-libbed that 'I'm feeling woozy' line towards the end?
No way! That's hilarious. How'd you find that out?
The commentary on the DVD. You should watch it if you like Scream.
I'll totally do that.
So if you had a crush on Matthew Lillard, did you end up watching Wing Commander?
Such an underrated movie.
I know! And I know it was kind of like Starship Troopers but-
Starship Troopers was way better but it was still really entertaining.
Agreed. Starship Troopers was better but I've heard it kind of missed the author's point with its adaptation.
What, like it didn't mock their society enough because everyone ACTUALLY felt triumphant at the end when they killed the bugs?
Yeah, exactly. But I don't know. I still loved it.
