Do you ever listen to classic rock?
Sometimes. I really like The Doors.
How about the Rolling Stones?
Oh yeah! Aren't they still touring and stuff?
Yeah, they're still going strong!
That must make them one of the longest running bands in rock history.
Oh, I'm sure. I hope they keep going for a long time to come.
Same here.
If they ever put on a concert here, we should go see them.
That would be awesome!
