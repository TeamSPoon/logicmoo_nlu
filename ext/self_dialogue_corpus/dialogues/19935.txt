Have you seen Psy's new music videos?
Psy?  Isn't he the Korean pop singer who did 'Gangnam Style?'
Yes he is.  He released two new music videos called "I Luv it" and "New Face."
That's cool, I had no idea.  I didn't realize he still did music.
Oh yea, he does.  He's huge in Korea.
How are his new music videos and songs?
They are very catchy and fun videos.
Better than 'Gangnam Style?'
I think 'Gangnam Style' set too high a bar.
Yea, it was so unique.  Catchy song, crazy dance moves and music video setting.
It became such a huge recognizable meme.
And it was interesting that a foreign music video by a foreign artist became such a major part of our own pop culture.
Even though K-pop is becoming extremely popular around the world, none of the other artists made it as mainstream as Psy.
Does he do similar in his new videos?
Yea, he does definitely try to replicate the magic of 'Gangnam Style.'  Gentleman, Daddy, I Luv it, and New Face all have the same trademark dance moves, settings, and catchy hook.
I'll have to check out the videos when I get home.
Do so, and let me know what you think.
I will.
I hope he keeps making more videos.  I'm always eager to see the new ones.
I'll let you know what I think of the videos after I watch them.
