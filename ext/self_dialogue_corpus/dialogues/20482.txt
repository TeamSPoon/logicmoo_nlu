What is probably the worst movie you have ever seen?
Oh wow, that's a tough one.
Yeah, there are a lot of really awful movies out there.
I think Santa Claus vs. The Martians was the worst one.
What a terrible movie idea.
Yes, it was really that bad.
Were there any good parts at least?
Well, most of the movie was really boring.
What was good though?
There was one particular part where somebody asked who was in an airlock.
What happened then?
The guy goes, "No one, now." That was when he dumped the people outside into space.
That's pretty terrible.
I thought it was hilarious, it was such a badly delivered line.
I think I would like to see this movie.
It's very old so it might be hard to find.
What year did it come out in?
I'm pretty sure it came out during the 70's, it definitely looked that old.
Ah, well that's not too bad. At least it's in color.
That much is true, but don't expect a thrilling plot.
