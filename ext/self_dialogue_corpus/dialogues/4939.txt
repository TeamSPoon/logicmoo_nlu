Hey! Did you catch the Yankees and Mets game last night?
You know it! I never miss a Yankees game.
Oh, that's right you have season tickets don't you?
Yup! Right above the 1st baseline.
Wow, those sound like great seats! Did you catch any foul balls?
No, not this time. But I did catch a few Derek Jeter foul balls back in the day.
They did like to pitch him inside..Whens the next game?
The Yankees play the Rays tomorrow at home, I have an extra ticket if you'd like to come?
That would be awesome, I haven't been to a basbeball game in years!
Sweet, i'll pick you up at 330? Chris Archer is pitching!
330 sounds good to me. Oh no way! That's easily one of the best Ray's players!
Yeah, Archer is pretty great. DIdn't you play baseball in high school?
Yes sir, I played centerfield but I was never any good.
Oh hush, I bet you we're the star of your team! I play in a softball league if you ever want to swing the ol' bat again!
A softball team and Yankee's tickets?! You must be the nicest person ever.
I just have a love for the sport. Baseball is America's pastime.
Well, I gotta get home before the Cardinals game tonight. Thanks again for the invite!
Oh no problem, Good luck to the cardinals and say hi to your wife for me!
Sound's good! see you tomorrow for some baseball!
Have a Home Run of a night!
