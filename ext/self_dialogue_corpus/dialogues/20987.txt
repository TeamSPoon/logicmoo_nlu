Do you like British films?
Does James Bond count?
Hardly, it's as much an American property as it is English.
Come to think of it, didn't Sony fund a few of the movies?
I think so. Might as well consider it a Japanese franchise then.
It's multinational.
Right. Maybe one day we'll have an American 007.
People would boycott the movie. It'll never happen.
Why not? We've had a British Spider-Man, and a British Superman.
Their actors were British, the characters were not.
Eh, same difference.
Not at all. Even if the characters are played by British actors, they themselves aren't British.
So, we could have an American actor play a British James Bond, you're saying?
Maybe, if he could do a really convincing English accent.
So you finally agree with me, huh?
I said maybe. I think people would still be upset with the idea.
Then we need to make our own James Bond. An American one.
We have one. He's called Jason Bourne.
That's not really the same thing though, is it?
It's as close as we're likely to ever get.
