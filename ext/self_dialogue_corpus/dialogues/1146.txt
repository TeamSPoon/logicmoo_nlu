What's your favorite NFL team?
That's easy the Indianapolis Colts.
Why do you like them?
I live in Indiana and got to see Peyton Manning's whole career here.
Peyton really did make football in Indiana popular.
The Colts have become 1000 times more popular since Peyton joined the team.
What was it like before Peyton?
The Colts were terrible.  We never won anything.
Didn't you play in a AFC Championship game?
Yeah in 1995 vs the Steelers.
That was a close game wasn't it?
We lost but we had a chance with a hail marry at the end of the game.
I thought the guy caught the ball.
It was close but he didn't
That was the first time I remember replay being used.
Replay was used before but it was one of the first times it decided the end of game.
Did the Colts have any other good years before Peyton?
No, we had a few years where we only won 1 game.
Well all those bad years helped you get Peyton in the draft.
Thank god, because if it wasn't for Peyton, the Colts may have left Indiana.
