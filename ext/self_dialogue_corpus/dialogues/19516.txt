What song do forget about  but love?
This is cheesy but close to you.
The Burt Bacharach song?
No, It is actually a carpenters song.
Really I don't think I knew that. Always thought that was a burt original song.
Close to You was even the name of the carpenter album nominated for album of the year.
I really was way off on that then!
There is always more to learn.
Yes, I feel a lot of songs now sample older songs and kids have no clue as to the original source.
So very true. It is funny when they think this artist is original.
Recently I had heard that cover of  Sexual Healing - Kygo Radio Edit.
Marvin gay original song is better.
i agree, but I thought so many youngsters probably have no clue this is really a  marvin gaye song.
It is sad to think they may never discover the source or older classics.
Also didn't robin thicke get sued because he ripped of marvin gaye?
I think so thicke's Blurred Lines VS Marvin Gaye - Got to Give it Up.
He clearly ripped the beat off.
I think it is super similar.
Undeniably. I think he should have just been upfront.
Ya just give credit where credit is due.
