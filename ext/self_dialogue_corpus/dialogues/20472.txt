Have you heard of Manchester by the Sea?
Yes.
Did you see it?
Yes, very depressing.
Oh okay, so I shouldn't see it then
Well, go ahead and watch it, but be prepared for some very sad scenes.
Oh dear. I don't do well with those types of movies.
Casey Affleck is phenomenal in it.
That's what I heard. Didn't he win an Oscar for his performance.
I believe so. Michelle Williams is also very good in it.
Does she play his wife?
Yes, but it doesn't end well.
Where is Manchester by the Sea?
It's an actual town in Massachusetts
Really? I did not know that.
Yeah, the cinematography in the movie is great.
Oh I always like really good visual effects in movie.
Then you will definitely appreciate this movie.
Okay, I'll have to check it out.
Yes, but be prepared to be sad.
