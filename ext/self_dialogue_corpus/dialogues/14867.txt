Did you ever see The Jerk?
Who was in that?
It was with Steve Martin.
So it's an older movie?
Yeah, it was from the 80's.
I never heard of it.  What's it about?
Steve Martin is adopted by this black family and grows up thinking he is black.  Then he goes off on his own into the city.
I don't see how that would make a good movie.
Well, he led a sheltered life and has a good heart, so he trusts everyone.  And he has a skewed view of the real world.
It sound kind of interesting.
