Do you listen to Khalid?
I've only heard like, one song. But I liked it.
I just downloaded his new album. I like the vibe.
Doesn't he sound a bit like Frank Ocean?
I never thought of that, but you are totally right.
I'll had to reinvestigate.
Definitely. I think he's coming to Boston soon.
Where?
House of blues. Want to get tickets?
I'll listen to the album first and let you know.
Sounds good. I'm also seeing Jidenna soon.
OH man, that song he had featured on Luke Cage was SO GOOD
I know right? I have it on repeat all the time.
I'm sure his show will be awesome.
I hope so. Anything else you listen to lately that you recommend?
I'e mostly been listening to the same old stuff. I really like Purity Ring and Banks lately.
I saw Banks open for The Weeknd. I wasn't impressed.
She's not the best live from what I've heard, but her songs are good.
I'll have to listen.
Definitely.
