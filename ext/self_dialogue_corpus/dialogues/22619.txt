Alfred Hitchcock is one of my favorite directors.
I've seen a couple of his movies. Psycho, of course, everyone has seen Psycho.
I don't know if his talents would be appreciated so much today as they were back when he was directing.
Why do you think that is?
He didn't really go for explicit gory stuff - it was more about suggestion, and letting the viewer's mind fill in all the scary details.
But in Psycho, we watch Janet Leigh get stabbed to death in the shower! Like a million times?
Ah, but the knife never actually penetrates her skin. The cuts were chosen very carefully to give that impression, but it's all suggestion.
No way! I could have sworn I saw the knife go in.
That was Hitchcock's genius. He let the viewer's mind do a lot of the work for him.
What are some of your favorite Hitchcock films?
I thought The Birds was really creepy, mostly because you never actually find out what makes the birds turn evil and attack people.
I have a parakeet at home - I would be pretty nervous if I thought she might attack me sometime, right out of the blue.
That's why the film is so disturbing - it takes something normal and harmless like a sparrow and turns it into a killing machine.
I liked his more sparkly, light films, like To Catch a Thief.
Cary Grand and Grace Kelly made such a beautiful couple. And Jessie Royce Landis, I loved her role as Grace's mom.
She was in another of Hitchcock's films, wasn't she?
She played Cary Grant's mother in North by Northwest, another of my favorites.
Wait a minute, she and Grant were like the same age, weren't they?
But she was totally believable as Grant's mom because she made you believe her in the role. I loved her sass in both of those movies.
You make me want to go rent a few Hitchcock films now.
