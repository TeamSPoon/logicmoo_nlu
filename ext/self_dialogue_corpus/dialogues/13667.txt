What was your least favorite Star Wars?
Definitely Attack of the Clones.
Yeah, Anakin was so annoying.
I can't believe that whole "I don't like sand." line.
That and the romance was so stale and robotic.
I didn't believe those two loved each other at all.
No. Though I suppose it's good Jar Jar was barely in it.
A few seconds of Jar Jar is a few seconds too many.
Yeah, even C3PO was kind of annoying.
Worst movie ever.
