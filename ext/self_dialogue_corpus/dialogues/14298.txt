Do you think the NBA should do away with a salary cap?
Yeah I think that it needs to be reworked.
So you wouldnt eliminate it altogether?
No I think that it could cause problems.
Teams would just join up together?
Yeah it creates a balance that you need in the league.
I can see the problem being that teams would try to skip on salaries.
Like the sixers have been?
Well there is a floor that you have to spend
I would rather see super teams to be honest
Baseball doesnt have the problem
They had it for years
But they still have no cap with no problem
Eventually things would work out but it may take 20 years
Then they should start the process now
They already allow teams to keep their own guys regardless of the cap
I know and it makes for a very confusing cap
I think there are several solutions
None of which we ever see implemented
Just have to wait and see how salaries rise or fall
