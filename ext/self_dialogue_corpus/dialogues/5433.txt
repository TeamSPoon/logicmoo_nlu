I feel like everyone remembers their first Disney movie. Like the one that came out when they were just old enough to go to the theater.
Oh, yeah. I remember my first was Little Mermaid.
Really? Me too!
Yeah, I went with my Dad and my brother, and when we left the theater my dad had to pop the hood for something. It was so windy the hood flew back and hit the windshield!
So that's your big memory of The Little Mermaid, huh?
Ha, yeah. I think I was about five years old.
I was a bit older. Maybe six. I remember the songs the most.
Look at this stuff. Isn't it neat!
I ran around the house with a fork for WEEKS.
I'm sure your parents loved that!
