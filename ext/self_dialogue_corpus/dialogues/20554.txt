Have you seen the new Beauty and The Beast film yet?
No, I have not was it as good as the old one.
It was live action, so not really comparable to the animation but it was pretty close, better than the Cinderella remake,
Yeah, I hated that one. Did you see they are making a remake movie of the Lion King, live action?
No, I did not. Why do the make so many remake movies?
I don't know, like the 20 Fast and The Furious movies?
I think they are at nine and I like them. Better than the Little Mermaid remake movie that is in the works.
Ugh, I know! But I did like Ghost-busters, the new one, talking about remakes.
With the all female cast, yeah it was a novel idea, poor execution. There are remaking an all Female Ocean's Eleven too,
I did not hear about that one, is it the same movie or what?
I think so, just female cast. Maybe they will make an Ocean's 11,12 and 13 like the other one.
I thought there were only twelve of them?
No, thirteen but only actually three.
That gets a little confusing, like the star wars movies, the first one is actually the third one and so on.
Episode one, chronologically the first movie, is the fourth to be released.
So confusing, like Fast and The Furious, sort of prequels then sequels all jumbled in there.
Yeah,I have never quite placed Tokyo Drift, in the timeline.
I liked that movie though , great racing scenes.
The acting was good too, nothing like Paul Walker era Furious.
For sure, I stopped liking those films after he passed away.
