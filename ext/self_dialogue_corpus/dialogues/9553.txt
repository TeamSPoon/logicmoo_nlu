Hey, man what sort music do you like?
I'm mainly into rap, but I can appreciate all types of music.
That's great, I've given rap a little bit of a listen but I just don't know where to start.
I may not know too many artists, but I could give you some decent ones to start off with if you'd like.
Yeah man, that would be awesome!
Alright, personally, I really like Future and Drake.
Do you have any favorite songs or albums in particular?
Yeah, I really like everything on DS2 by Future.
Alright, thanks man, i'll give it a listen tonight.
Yeah, no problem. Feel free to him me up for more music.
