Who is your favorite Star Wars character?
Probably Han Solo or Boba Fett, what about you?
I like the Jedi characters like Obi Wan and Rey.
Did you like the prequel movies at all?
They were OK but not nearly as good as the original.
Did you like any of the Jedi in those movies?
I liked Liam Neeson's character but that's about it.
Yeah, I didn't like Anakin Skywalker at all.
I'm really excited for episode 8!
Yes me too, I can't wait!
