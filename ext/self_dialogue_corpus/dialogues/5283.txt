Mary poppins was such a good movie
I wish I had a nanny like that.
I know I would also like to be able to clean with magic.
I liked the chimney sweep scene
i liked the part when the art came to life
that was a really neat scene also
the music was good in this movie
it really was a classic musical Disney movie
Mary Poppins should really exist, she is my favorite
she is also my favorite, I wish I had her as a kid!
