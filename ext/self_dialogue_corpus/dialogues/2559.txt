So, who is the greatest quarterback of all time?
I know you want me to say Joe Montana.
Why is that?
Because you know I'm a 49er fan, and you want to disprove his greatness.
I'm not that mean, but he was rather slow with an average arm--what's so great about that?
Four Super Bowl Wins, no losses, MVP three times.
Well, mediocre quarterbacks have won the Super Bowl and the winning quarterback is usually the MVP.
Montana could read the defense, throw with deadly accuracy to an open receiver, and lead that receiver into long gains after the catch.
O.K. the guy was pretty good.  Would you consider anyone else?
Well, Dan Marino probably was the best passer.
Yeah, for an immobile guy to just stand there and throw for that many yard is pretty impressive.  How about Joe Namath?
Are you trying to sucker me?  Joe Namath's win in Super Bowl III changed the history of professional football, but he only threw for about 200 yards in that game.
Well, the game was different then--not the big passing yardage, but Namath good, but not the greatest.
I guess I have to consider Tom Brady.
You think.  Seven Super Bowl appearances.
I thought the Super Bowl was not a necessary criterion.
O.K, but seven?
He lost two.
I guess you're never going to back down from Joe Montana.
Well, there's Steve Young.
