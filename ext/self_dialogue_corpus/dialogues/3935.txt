One of my favorite thrillers is Fatal Attraction.
That's a freaky movie.
I think Glen Close is great in that!
Yes, but Michael Douglas isn't really sympathetic in that role.
Yeah, you don't feel sorry for him.
I do feel bad for the wife.
I feel bad for the bunny rabbit.
Oh, that poor rabbit.
It does make you want to stay faithful.
Required pre-marital movie!
