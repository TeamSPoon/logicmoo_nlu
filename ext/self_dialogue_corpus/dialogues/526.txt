So, what do you think of the Detroit Lions this year?
I don't know, I think it may be the same old Lions again.
Well, I think they might actually have a chance.
A chance for what?
Maybe making it into the playoffs.
Okay, I guess you can always dream about it.
Well, they certainly won't ever be able to top their season in 2008 where they went 0-16.
Hopefully that's not a performance they will ever want to repeat!
Well, now that they have Martha Ford at the head of the organization, we will need to see what happens.
Their record wasn't too bad this past year.
Yes, 9-7.
Certainly got them into the playoffs as a wild card!
I read somewhere that most of the other pro sports teams in Michigan aren't doing well.
True!  It's kind of sad when the Lions are our best chance to get into the NFL playoffs.
There are many people who still keep up hope.  The Lions seem to be getting their roar back again.
Well they just hired some new folks to change up their logo and marketing. Maybe that will help!
I certainly hope so, I hope that with the refresh, they will be able to continue to look forward.
At the very least, it won't hurt them.
We definitely need to break the streak and go to the Super Bowl this coming year!
Yes, 60 years of no Super Bowl is definitely enough!
