How's your jewelry business going?
I'm selling quite a bit.
What do you make?
Necklaces and earrings. I buy materials and also repurpose old jewelry.
Did you make that necklace with all the trangles on it?
Yes. I went to the store and it seemed like all the jewelry had triangles. I had to get in on the trend.
I like that but haven't seen the triangle jewelry at stores.
It was really prevalent.
Do you have a Facebook page?
Yes. If you want I'll invite you to it.
Good. I want to buy some flower earrings for my mom.
I have roses and otus flowers right now but am getting some others soon.
I might get the roses.
Those are popular. I don't have many left so let me know soon.
Do you have a pic of them on hand?
It's this.
Those are amaing. I will get earrings.
I can make them today.
I can't wait. I'll advertise your page for you too.
Thanks so much.
