Do you like The Rescuers?
I just watched it for the first time recently. I loved the mice.
Did you see part 2?
There's a part 2?
Yeah, it came out decades after part 1.
Cool. What is it called?
The Rescuers Down Under
Is it like the first one?
Yeah, but they have to save a new kid of course.
I must watch it.
