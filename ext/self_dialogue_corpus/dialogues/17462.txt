Have you ever heard of The Paper Chase?
I don't think so. What are they like?
They're hard to describe! They use a lot of horror themes in their music, and they're kind of experimental. The frontman started in production work.
Experimental how?
Well, their stuff is more something that incorporates music than it is music per se. They use a lot of sampling and unusual instrumentation, and they mostly made concept albums.
I like concept albums a lot! What are they about?
Most of them have horror themes, and the songs often tell a story, but it's usually vague and out of order.
I like horror, but I like sci-fi more. Do they have anything like that?
If you like sci-fi and want to get into them, their Ctrl-Alt-Del-U is a must-hear! I think it's about space colonization, but it's up for interpretation.
That sounds interesting. Is that a good album to start with?
I think it is, but people usually seem to start with Now You Are One Of Us or God Bless Your Black Heart.
Are those albums good?
I think they're very good! I like all of their albums!
Do you have favorite songs from those two I could check out?
I like "...And All The Candy You Can Eat" on Now You Are One Of Us, and "Dying With Decent Music" on God Bless Your Black Heart.
I'll give those a listen! Do they have any new albums coming out?
They broke up in 2010, but John Congleton has a new band with a similar but different sound.
That's too bad, but I guess I could check them out, too.
You should! And listen to Someday This Could All Be Yours pt. 1, it's the last Paper Chase album and they kind of reference each other.
Wow, it sounds like I'd have to make an evening of this!
