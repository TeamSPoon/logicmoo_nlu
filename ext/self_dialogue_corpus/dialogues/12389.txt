You know what I never understood about Star Wars.
What's that?
Why those storm troopers were such horrible shots
Yeah, that's true, they missed a lot.
Yeah, they were supposed to be these highly trained soldiers
Yet they were always missing their targets.
Well except for when they shot Leia at the end of Jedi
I don't remember that one
It was the scene where they were at the shield generator door
Oh yeah, but Han took care of him later.
