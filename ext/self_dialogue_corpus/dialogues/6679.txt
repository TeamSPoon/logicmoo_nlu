Up was such a great movie.
A lot of people liked that movie. It draws you in so quickly, too.
Yes. It was actualy kind of emotional watching that first bit where they run through the man's entire life, and losing his wife.
That was a well-done clever bit to develop the plot really quickly.
Oh, yeah. I remember that was how we learned about why he decided to go on his trip.
Then that little kid showed up unexpectedly on the porch.
That was so funny! I remember he knocks on the front door when the house is in mid-air.
It was an endearing movie. I guess I just felt a little confused towards the end.
What do you mean?
Well, it just kind of seemed like the talking-dog invention and some other stuff came a bit out of nowhere at the end of the movie.
