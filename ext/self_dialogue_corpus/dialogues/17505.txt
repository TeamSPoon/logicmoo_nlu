So have you been to any concerts lately?
No, but I would love to go soon.  It's been a while...
Me too.  I heard Billy Idol might be touring outside of Vegas soon!
Excellent!  Would you like to go?
Sure, I'm a huge fan.  80's music was the best!
I agree with you there!  What's your favorite Billy Idol song?
Pumping on Steel.
Wow, that's a hidden gem.  What else?
I liked his cover of Don't You Forget About me.
Yes, I enjoyed that as well!  Of course he had a lot of great hits!
Certainly!  Rebel Yell never gets old!
Don't forget about Eyes Without a Face!
How could I?  He has aged well and still puts on a great show!
I heard the same.  Steve Stevens is with him again as well!
Excellent!  So when is the show?
I'm not sure.  I would have to look online.
OK, I'll look as well.  In the meantime, could you lend me a CD?
Sure, my Best Of is around here somewhere...
Sweet! Just let me know and we'll have a blast!
I can't wait!  Talk soon!
