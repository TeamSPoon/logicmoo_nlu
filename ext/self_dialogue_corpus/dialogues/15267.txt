You know what I miss? Eighties music.
For real. The eighties were so unique and so timeless.
That was back when music was not commercialized and anybody could make it big.
You're right. How many obscure bands or singers came out of nowhere to make it big.
Plenty. Today you see the popular singers come up as youngsters and it's almost as if the industry forces them to become stars.
Yes, it does seem that way.
Just think of some of the obscure bands from the Eighties: Dexies Midnight Runners, Social Timex, A-Ha.
All one hit wonders there, but timeless music.
Who could ever forget the A-Ha song, take on me.
I still remember the video.
It's a song that's transcended generations. I still listen to it today.
I think most of the youngsters these days recognize that song today.
I wonder if that song would be a HIT today if it was released today.
It would be if someone remade it. But, I think you're asking if the song never existed and came out today.
Correct. That's what I meant.
Hard to tell. I would say yes.
Come on Eileen probably wouldn't be a HIT if it came out today.
That song is redundant and would get lost today in the endless availability of music. I would agree. It probably wouldn't be a HIT today.
It screams eighties. They struck it lucky releasing it in 1982.
Sure did. I think lots of bands did back then.
