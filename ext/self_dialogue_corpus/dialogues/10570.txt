Did you watch that movie called Magic Mike?
No, who is in that.
It stars Channing Tatum.
Oh ok I think I've heard about it.
It was underrated for sure.
Is that so?
Yes I really enjoyed it.
I thought it might have been more directed towards women given the subject of male dancers.
It was actually great entertainment for any adult.
Why is that?
There is a decent story to it, with great visual effects as well.
Ok that sounds like a good combination.
