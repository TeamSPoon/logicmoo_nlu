What is your favorite music video by Lady Gaga?
I have two favorites Bad Romance and Telephone. How about you?
My favorite is Poker Face. She was so pretty in that one.
I thought her nose looked weird in that video. She looks hotter in the Bad Romance video.
I loved her sparkling outfit in that video.
I liked her in that red outfit. I also like her eyes in that video.
Oh her eyes where very pretty in Bad Romance.
I wonder what make-up she uses?
She probably has her own brand of make-up.
Maybe but either way she is very pretty in all her videos.
