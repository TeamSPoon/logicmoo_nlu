What ya up to?
I was gonna watch a flick.
Which one?
Not sure yet. Whatever is on Netflix.
Cool. I just say a really great show on there.
Which one?
The Secret Lives of Pets.
The cartoon?
Yeah.
Not really into animation.
What?!
Not since I was a kid.
There has to be something you like.
Nothing comes to mind...
Toy Story?
OK. That was pretty good.
Well you should give Pets a try.
Alright, I will.
You won't regret it.
I'd better not. I know where to find you!
