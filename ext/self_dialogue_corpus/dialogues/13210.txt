So what's your favorite Star Wars movie?
I'd personally pick A New Hope.
The film that started it all. Can't blame you for that one.
I appreciate that. So what's yours?
I'd have to go with Return of the Jedi.
A classic. I'd say that the first three films are the three best.
Same here. The newer ones aren't too bad, either.
I really enjoyed The Force Awakens. It felt like a breath of fresh air to me.
I felt the same way, but somehow I enjoyed Rogue One just a bit more.
That's all well and good. It was a great film too.
