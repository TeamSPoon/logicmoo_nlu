Do you consider The Sixth Sense to be a thriller or horror? I see it listed as both.
It's a thriller, no doubt.
Why not horror?
Just because it has ghosts and dead people doesn't make it a thriller. They're not interacting or causing anything.
So it's the mystery and suspense?
Yeah, you never feel scared in the movie. You just want to hear and see what's happening.
Did you enjoy the twist?
Yeah, but I can't watch it again.
Why not?
The problem with a thriller that has a twist is you can only see it once or twice, because you know exactly what's going to happen.
