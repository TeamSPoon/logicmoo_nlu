Do you remember the Disney movie The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr Toad.
I watched it when I was a kid but I really don't remember what it is about.
Wasn't it based on Sleepy Hollow?
I thought it was two different movie segments.
Oh yeah, there was the Wind and the Willow part about Mr Toad?
Do you remember what that one was about?
Wasn't Mr Toad an adventurer that never paid attention to costs.
Yes but I haven't seen it in so long that I do not remember the plot.
Maybe we should watch it again.
Good idea, how about Friday night?
