Do you like to listen to rock music?
Yes! My favorite band is U2.
Oh yeah? What is your favorite album by them?
I really love The Joshua Tree. Did you know that they have a tour for the 30th anniversary?
No, I didn't know that! I personally liked Achtung Baby.
Me too, that's a good album. What other rock bands do you like?
I really like classic rock - The Rolling Stones, The Who, Pink Floyd, and so on.
Those are all good choices. Mick Jagger is one of my heroes.
Yeah, I really like that era of music.
They just don't make them like that anymore!
