It makes me laugh when a band has a greatest hits come out after only releasing two albums.
Oh, I know. Savage Garden did that.
I love that band. I didn't know that about them.
I only do because I saw the album on Amazon.
I might buy it.
It was super cheap.
Why do you suppose bands do that?
Maybe to get more money.
My aunt says it's so they can put out a few new tracks without having to come up with a whole new album.
I guess that makes sense.
Like they can put one or two new songs on with all the hits.
Right. I think Martina McBride did that.
She did. There were a few new songs on that.
I have that album.
So do I but now she has a new one called Essential.
Really?
Yes. It's a two disc set.
I'll have to get it.
I have it already.
Let's listen to it now.
