Have you heard the new song by The Killers?
No, what's it called?
The Man, it just came out today.
How is it?
It's okay.  The video was interesting.
What is the song about?
About being the man.
That sounds really arrogant.
It might be tongue in cheek.  Sometimes I don't really get what they're going for in their music.
Yes, they're songs can seem abstract at times.
The video features Brandon Flowers heavily.
Did you like the video?
I think the video was better than the song.
Are you planning to get the album when it comes out?
I think I'll wait until I hear more songs off of it.
So, you weren't crazy about The Man?
No, it was just interesting to hear a new song from them.
Yes, it seems like it's been a while since their last album.
Maybe, that's why they chose this as their first song.  Like a proclamation.
That makes sense.  Do you recommend listening to the song?
