Do you know what movie I would like to watch again?
Finding Nemo? No dude I have no idea.
No Country for Old Men, such a cool flick.
Heck yes, there are some weird and spooky dudes in that one.
Javier Bardem......I had no idea who he was until that movie.
Anton was dirty, nasty, mean and despicable.
What about Woody Harrelson's character? He was like the weirdo on the fringe who liked to count the number of floors in buildings.
Yeah, he didn't last too long though. Anton made sure of that.
They should have made an alternate ending where Anton got what he deserved at the end.
No way man, the movie was dark all the way. It ended like it was supposed to end.
