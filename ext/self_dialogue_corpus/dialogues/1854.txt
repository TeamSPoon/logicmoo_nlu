Hi! Are you an NFL fan?
Yeah, I'm a Patriots fan. What team do you support?
I've always liked the Packers.
Who do you think is a better quarterback, Tom Brady or Aaron Rodgers?
I'd have to say Rodgers. If you look at his stats, he blows Brady out of the water.
As a Pats fan, I'd have to disagree and say Brady. Stats aren't everything.
If stats aren't important, why do you think Brady is better then?
He has had more success as a quarterback, and obviously has the leadership skills to lead a team to the super bowl multiple times.
Still, football is a team sport. The Packers have struggled because of their lack of a good defence.
Brady also has more experience, and has a clutch factor that is rarely seen elsewhere.
I'd have to argue that Rodgers has the same, if not better.
True, I did see some of the miracle games last season.
That said, I would still favor your team over mine for this season.
Why do you say that?
Well until Brady retires, he has a better overall team.
That's probably true, considering what you said about your defence.
Hopefully he'll age out soon though, he's getting really old.
As long as he doesn't retire before we see a Packers and Patriots super bowl.
Agreed, that would be one to go down for the ages.
And it would be a perfect ending to Brady's career.
