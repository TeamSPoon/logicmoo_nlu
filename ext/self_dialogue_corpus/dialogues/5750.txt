Who's your favorite sidekick in The Little Mermaid, Flounder or Sebastian?
I like Flounder because it's so cute how anxious he is.
Yeah. It seems like Sebastian is anxious in his own way as well.
I agree. He was overbearing, but his heart was in the right place.
I love when he sings the song Under the Sea to convince Ariel about how great the ocean is.
That is the best song in the movie.
I agree. I can't even remember any of the other ones.
Me either. Didn't Ursula sing a song sometime?
Hm. Now that you say that it does ring a bell.
Oh, I remember now. It was Poor Unfortunate Souls.
