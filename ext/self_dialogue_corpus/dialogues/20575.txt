I've been thinking about this. I think Magnolia is my favorite Paul Thomas Anderson movie.
What did he direct again?
A bunch of stuff. Boogie Nights, There Will Be Blood, Inherent Vice... it's a long list.
Those are all great movies. I haven't seen Magnolia though.
You're missing out!
What makes it so great?
Well, it's a big ensemble cast with a bunch of stories taking place at once.
Okay, that could be interesting.
And they all gradually intersect and are changed by a moment of total strangeness.
I'd be interested in watching it. It sounds kind of like Crash though.
It's much better than Crash. Crash was bad.
It really was. I have no idea how it won an oscar.
There Will Be Blood nearly won for best picture though.
See, that's probably the one I'd pick as a favorite.
Oh yeah?
Yep. It's such a lurid story. It just draws you in.
I liked it, but I didn't like it as much as I liked Magnolia.
Should we each watch the other's favorite again?
Just to see if we have the same opinion?
I don't know. It could be fun!
