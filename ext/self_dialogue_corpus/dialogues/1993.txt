Hey, man. Ready for this upcoming NFL season?
You know it. I love football.
Same here. Who do you think is going to the Super Bowl this year?
I can see the Patriots and Cowboys playing each other.
That's too easy! I'm gonna say the Steelers and Saints play this year.
That is also plausible. Steelers look great.
Oh yeah. Big Ben, Brown, and Bell... wow.
Yeah, they should have beat the Pats last year!
I'm excited to see Marshawn's return to the field as well.
Oh, yeah. He's gonna be running fools over!
That's what I'm hoping for! Beastquake!
I wonder how the Seahawks fill about it.
Probably a bit upset, I'd imagine. He is one heck of a player.
I also wonder if Romo will come back after a little bit.
Yeah, I've heard he might, after he finishes announcing for a year.
I wonder which team he would fit in with...
No idea. He needs a great offensive line though, since he's so old.
Yes indeed. He has bones made of paper, it seems.
Are you excited about the preseason?
Oh, no doubt! I can't wait to be watching football!
