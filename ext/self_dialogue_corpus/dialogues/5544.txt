Have you seen the new live action Beauty and the Beast movie yet?
No, I haven't, have you?
No, but I'm dying to go.
Me too.  I think they did such a good job picking Emma Watson to portray Belle.
I agree.  She really looked the part from the advertisements.
I wonder how they did Beast?
I'm not sure, but I bet it required a lot of make up and CGI.
Speaking of CGI, I heard the servants are great also.
Yeah, I can't wait to see the "Be Our Guest" scene.
Do you think they have the original songs?
