Everyone always gives Nickelback such a hard time.
I kind of do too.  I really don't like them.
They're really not bad though.
I guess they aren't bad.  For me, I just don't like modern rock too much.
Well, why does everyone hate them?
I think it's more of a bandwagon thing.
Like your friend hates them, so you do too?
Yeah.  It just becomes fun to laugh at them.
I don't really see the sense in that.  it's good music.
I mean, if you think so, you should keep listening.
