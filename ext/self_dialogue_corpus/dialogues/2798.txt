Do you like the Chicago bears?
Not since Singletary, Tomzack and Perry were on the team.
When was that?
Probably mid 80's I think.
That was a while ago. How old were you?
I think somewhere around 12 or 13 I think.
Why is that time so special?
My dad lived outside of Chicago and he would take me to go see the games sometimes.
That would be a good reason to like them if you see them play in person.
Yes but it was more than that.
What do you mean?
Well in truth I loved watching the three of them play.
Tomzack was an amazing quarterback but certainly not the best.
Maybe not but he was fun to watch play.
What position did Singletary play?
He was a linebacker and is now a coach.
Who was Perry?
William Perry was a defensive lineman.
Wait I remember him. He had a cool nickname right?
They called him Refrigerator Perry and he was a force to be reckoned with.
