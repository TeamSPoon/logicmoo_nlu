Did you see they remade 'The Mummy'?
Yeah, with Tom Cruise?
That's right. Seems kind of soon to do a remake.
That's what I thought - the original didn't come out that long ago.
I guess Hollywood is struggling for good action movies. Have you seen reviews?
I have, and they're not great.
That's what I thought. Everyone is sick of remakes.
Not even Tom Cruise can save it - he isn't a box office pull anymore.
Yeah, in the 90s he was the ultimate action movie hero.
Tom Cruise did do a lot of great action movies.
