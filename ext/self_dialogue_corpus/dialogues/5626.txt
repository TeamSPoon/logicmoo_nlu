I don't think disney wants to admit that cars 2 was a thing.
Cars 3 wasnt so bad, I never saw 2 though.
It was basically a spy movie with cars in it.
Thats very weird.
I know right?
When you think about it, the whole cars world is a bit unsettling. What was disney thinking?
Well disney is the king of personification, so they did what came naturally.
Yeah, but a whole world of cars? Do you think they had a car world war?
Oh jeez I didnt think of that.
Was there a car holocaust? They world may never know.
