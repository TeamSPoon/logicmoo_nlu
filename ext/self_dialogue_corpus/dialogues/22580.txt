Ever seen Zombieland?
Great movie.
Yeah, Woodie Harrilson cracked me up in that.
That whole cast was good.  Especially Bill Murrey.
Oh man, that scene was amazing.
Yeah, I like how Woodie Harrilson used to pain 3 on his car.
Ha!   He was such a redneck in that movie.
Yeah he was.  I liked zombie kill of the week too.
That was funny.  How about all the rules.
Yeah, rule #1 cardio.
Yeah, he starts getting chased and it lights up.
Every time he went over another rule I cracked up.
And it showed how he got other rules too.
Like check the back seat.
That was good.
And at the end he shoots that Twinkie.
That was gold.  All he ever wanted was a Twinkie the whole time.
Poor guy.
Good gag in the movie though.
Yeah, it made me laugh a lot.
