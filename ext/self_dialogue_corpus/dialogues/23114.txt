Did you like 8 mile?
Yes I did, it had Eminem in it which was great.
Did you know that's his life story?
I wasn't aware of that is it true?
I believe so especially since he was in it.
They could of had a script though.
Yes but do you think Eminem would do something that would be a lie as big as that.
You're right he would never do that to himself or his fans.
I also think all the places or most of them were accurate homes or the ones from his life too.
That's awesome, do you know if that was his real mom in the movie?
That I don't know but it's a good question.
I might look it up sometime.
Do you also like his music?
Yeah I love his music and it's the reason I watched the movie, im a big fan.
Remember the scene where he barfed on his sweater because he was nervous?
I do that was actually in one of his songs too.
Do you want to watch it tonight?
Sure thing.
I'll bring over the DVD.
I'll get the food.
