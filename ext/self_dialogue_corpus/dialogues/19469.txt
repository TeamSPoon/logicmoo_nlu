I absolutely love groove metal music.
Like Pantera?
Well, Pantera basically popularized it, so yeah?
True. Vulgar Display of Power is a prime album for groove metal.
Don't forget about Cowboys From Hell. That one started it all.
That's true. I'm also partial to Sacrament or Ashes of the Wake.
Those aren't Pantera albums.
I know. They're Lamb of God albums.
Oh. I forget that those are groove albums.
Yeah. Lamb of God are to groove what Pantera was during the 90s.
Its a shame what became of Pantera.
Yeah it is. I wish that they didn't end on such a bitter note.
Not to mention Dimebag's death.
I'd like to think that there'd be a better chance of a Pantera reunion if Dime was still alive.
Maybe. At least their members are doing alright.
Phil has kind of been in a bad state lately.
Why do you say that?
He's been accused of being a neo-Nazi of all things. That, and his voice just isn't that good anymore.
I didn't know about the first one. I agree with the second one, though.
It's a shame what age and drugs do to someone.
