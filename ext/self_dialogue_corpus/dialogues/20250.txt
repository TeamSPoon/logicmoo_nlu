Did anyone see Rough Night?
I want to go see it but I haven't had the time yet.
It is a comedy about women's night out.  It looks very fun.
It's a bachelorette weekend, right?
I believe it is!
They have some fun in Miami, and it gets carried away.
Who is the director?
Lucia Aniello is the director I believe.
Do you know the screenplays?
Paul W. Downs and Lucia Aniello are the screenplay writers.
Paul W. Downs, Lucia Aniello, Matthew Tolmach, and  Dave Becky produced it.
I hope that the critics gave it a fair shake.
Well, I do see a mix in reviews, more like 50/50.
That is disappointing.
Do you know who stars in it?
Scarlett Johanssen, Kate McKinnon, and Jillian Bell are in this movie.
I think it's worth seeing, I love McKinnon.
Her work on late night comedy is outstanding.
Maybe we should see it together.
Let's try this weekend.
