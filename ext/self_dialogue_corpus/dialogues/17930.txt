What are you listening to right now?
"Florida Kilos" by Lana Del Rey.
Nice!! I love Lana!
Same. What's your favorite song by her?
I love her song "Kill Kill".
I haven't heard that, is it new?
Actually super old! It is from before she was known was Lana Del Rey.
What, I didn't know she has unreleased stuff!
Yeah, it's pretty decent!
Can you buy it off of Amazon or Itunes?
Unfortunately not. I was lucky enough to hear the track once because a friend has a copy of the record, but I can't find it anywhere!
Man, I'd love to hear it. Hopefully someday!
What's your favorite song by her?
This is going to sound very unoriginal, but I love "Video Games"!
No shame! It's a classic!
Definitely, I just love how romantic it is and how beautiful she sounds singing it.
The video is pretty awesome too, huh?
I love the video!
Are you excited for her to release her new album?
Yes, I can't wait for "Lust for Life" to come out!
