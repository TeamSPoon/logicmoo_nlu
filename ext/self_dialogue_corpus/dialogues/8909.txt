Do you want to go out to dinner with me tonight?
I would, but I'm really broke.
I can pay for you, I have a new side venture and I've been making quite a bit of money selling stuff on ebay.
What are you selling?
I had a lot of old concert tshirts from when I used to go to concerts all the time. Even though they are used and old, people are willing to pay good money for them.
Really? What kind of money?
I sold an L7 tshirt for $60 last week.This week I put up a Def Lepard shirt for 15, one from The Cranberries for 25, and a rare Collective Soul shirt I got 35 for.
Wow. I have a bunch of old concert tshirts too, maybe I should try that.
90s alternative bands are really popular. I must have a dozen Smashing Pumpkins tshirts, and they fetch a good price, but I'm hanging on to those cause I really like that band.
I have several Metallica tshirts I never wear cause they're too small now, I should auction those off.
