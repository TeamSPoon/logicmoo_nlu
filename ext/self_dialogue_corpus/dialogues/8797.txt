Nirvana is the most overrated band ever.
No joke.  I don't know why they were so popular.
They were kind of the first grunge act so they had first rites to it.
The thing about Nirvana is they really don't have many memorable songs.
'Smells Like Teen Spirit' is all I ever hear.
Me too.
I think they were only as popular just because Kurt Cobain committed suicide.
It probably helped them achieve their notoriety.
Had he not killed himself, I think they would have kind of just died out like most acts.
Yeah, I agree with you.
