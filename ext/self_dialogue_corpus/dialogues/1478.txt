Who do you think is the rising star in the AFC East division?
That's a tough one! But I'm going for Trey Flowers.
Why do you say that?
Flowers started the final eight games of the regular season, finishing with seven sacks.
True, and he capped his year with a key sack of Matt Ryan in the Super Bowl that pushed the Falcons out of field goal range, likely saving the Patriots' comeback bid.
Exactly. Flowers has a long way to go until he is considered in the same company as Khalil Mack or Von Miller, but his arrow is pointing up.
I agree. I think DeVante Parker would be my pick.
He is definitely up there. What's your reason?
Parker was one of Miami's best players in spring practices, and was hard to defend and made various big plays.
True. I expect Parker to surpass 1,000 receiving yards for the first time in his career and have the type of breakout season the Dolphins have been waiting for.
That would be something! I really hope he does.
What about the Jets defensive lineman, Leonard Williams?
Isn't he already a star?
Yea, but I still think he's on the rise.
What makes you say that?
He's only 23 and hasn't reached his ceiling yet. Scary, right?
Right. He has had two good years, but he's still learning the nuances of the position.
His defensive line coach certainly agrees and believes in Williams.
That's awesome. Williams is improving as a pass-rusher and said his goal is at least 10 sacks and to make the Pro Bowl.
I sure hope so,  he made seven sacks last year and was a Pro Bowl replacement.
