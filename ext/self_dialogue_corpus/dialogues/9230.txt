What's your favorite Metal band?
I like Def Leppard!
Yes, they are great. But, they are kind of soft.
Okay, for Heavy Metal, I like Judas Priest!
Now, you are talking! I saw them one time.
How was it?
It was a typical rock music kind of of show.
What does that mean?
You know, things like women dancing on a stage covered with lights and fog.
That sounds amazing! We should see if any rock music artists are on tour this summer.
