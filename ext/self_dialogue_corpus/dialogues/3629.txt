What horror movie was the funniest you have seen?
I would say krampus.
I found that actually scary.
Come on,the whole premise is comical. Then look at toni collette I think of her as a comedic actress.
Toni Collette is multi-faceted. Sure there are comedies films of hers, but what about six sense. I think of her just as a great actress.
I suppose that is true I forgot about some of her other roles. I still thInk krampus is a comical horror film.
I suppose I agree that there is a comical aspect, the idea of an evil santa is somewhat funny.
That's is what I am saying. Also some of the lines are funny.
Like what lines? can you quote any?
Take this one for example, and so many others...Max: Are we going to be okay? [Omi talks in German] Max: What? Aunt Dorothy: She said we're fucked!
