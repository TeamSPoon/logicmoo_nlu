Two of my favorite Pop singers are Ricki Lee Jones and Billy Beater.
I remember them. Ricki Lee still singing?
Yes. You remember her crossover hit? What was the name of it
Chuck E's in love and I think she released in 1979.
You are right on the money on both accounts.
Now your friend Billy Beater sounds like a 1950s singer. (laughs)
Well you are almost right.
How so and did have any hit records?
As a matter of fact, her. You ever heard of a little number called "At This Mom-"
"Moment?" He made that? Radio stations were playing that song all the time.
It was a hit by all standards. A man in love with his woman being tops.
Both of your Pop artists sung songs about men falling in love.
Love songs like "Ooh Baby Baby" sometimes makes me cry.
You're kidding! Wasn't that written by Motown singer Smokey Robinson?
Yes. He wrote a lot love songs for Motown.
He wrote Mary Wells first big crossover hit "My Guyl."
How do you know that but don't know Billy Beater? (laughs)
Some songs are memorable than others I guess.
You know that crying thing I mentioned earlier is just between us okay?
You probably cry to Whitney Houston's " And I will always love you" don't you?
