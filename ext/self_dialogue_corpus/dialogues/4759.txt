The Philadelphia Phillies are a joke!
They are one of the worst teams in baseball.
I don't think I would spend 5 dollars to go watch them play
They are an awful team with a notoriously bad lineup
Their pitching sucks really bad as well. They are just a hard team to watch!
I would rather watch curling on TV then to be subjected to their play.
Right now this team and organization are an embarrassment.
I just think it is amazing how fast a team can sink back into mediocrity
Yeah it's hard to believe that there was a time when this team was amazing.
Yeah this team used to have a lot of swagger, but now they are pathetic to watch.
We are less than 40 games into the season and they are already 10 games under 500.
They have lost 8 out of their last 10 and I don't see that turning around any time soon.
I guess on the bright side they are playing .500 ball at home.
Yeah, but they struggled horribly on the road and they have played more road games to this point.
But it won't matter, this team is just not good.
Very true. It's bad when the season is already over and you just got started.
Yeah this is an organization that needs to start over from scratch.
Yeah this team won't be good for a long, long time.
But you never know, things can change fast in sports.
Maybe, but it's going to take some divine intervention to change this team around.
