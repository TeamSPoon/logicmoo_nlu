Oh - yes, I really enjoy classic rock.
Who are some of your favorite bands?
I really like The Beatles, The Who, The Rolling Stones, and Led Zeppelin.
Can you tell me some of your favorite songs from The Beatles?
Sure, I really like one that is lesser known called You Won't See Me.  And another oldie, Please Mr. Postman.
Please Mr Postman was a cover by the Beatles.  Do you know who did it originally?
Maybe not originally, but I do know it was done by the Marvelettes in the 60's.
