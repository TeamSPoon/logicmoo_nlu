Have you read the Cursed Child screenplay yet?
Yeah, it wasn't quite what I expected.
What do you mean?
I expected it to be more like the novels. Harry didn't interact as much with his kids as I expected either.
Well, the focus was supposed to be on his youngest son.
Sure, but there just wasn't enough interaction between the two different generations.
It had to be concise, though. It's a screenplay, not a novel.
I guess you're right. I just wish there were more.
There could be at some point. They could make it into a movie and then a novel.
That would be awesome.
