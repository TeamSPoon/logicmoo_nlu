Did you see central highschool play cretin durham hall
yeah, I can't believe central won, they don't even have an ice rink.
I heard they have a new coach and he has been recruiting from all the public middle schools.
Yeah, and they've got some big goons, they have to be seniors.
Plus they've got that new center from up north.
Yeah i think the kid is from international falls.
their goalie was always good, he played in summer leagues, I don't know why he went to central.
The left wing, is a freshman they are saying he is already being looked at by recruiters.
Its crazy, cretin has sent like  players to the NHL in the last ten years
who was that kid that played for the wild?
Johnson I think.
He had a real future, but he I heard he got into painkillers hard after his injury from  that fight.
Do you think you are going to go to the next central match.
I havent been to a highschool match in years.
I think it's worth checking out.
I think your right, do you wanna go to a wild game next week, Ive got seats right by the penalty box.
Ok, that would be great.
who do you like
koivu, I like the way he moves
