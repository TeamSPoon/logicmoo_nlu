I think Robin Williams gave the Genie so much character in Aladdin.
I love Robin, but others could have did just as well.
Really, who??
Jim Carrey, Adam Sandler, Chris Rock to name a few
All fine actors, but that role was practically made for Robin.
Give me a better argument.
You can pratically see Robin himself acting rather than a cartoon.
That's actually a good point.
His mannerisms even in cartoon form were top notch.
He was such a lengend; R.I.P.
