That one movie is looking pretty good. I might go see it.
Which one's that?
It's Despicable Me 3. I watched the first one, but I missed the second one.
Well, you really should see the second one before the third one.
I'm sure the storyline isn't so deep that I need to watch them in order.
Suit yourself. You enjoy animated movies?
It depends but yeah. Also, Steve Carell is the voice of the main character.
I do like that guy. Especially when he was on The Office.
Kristen Wiig is in it too. As his wife, I read.
Oh, I don't know much about her. What other movies has she done?
Let me think. She was in the Ghostbusters movie, last year.
Oh, right, that movie got some flack, but really, it wasn't bad.
I didn't see it actually. Any good?
It was different than the old Ghostbusters, but for what it was, it was pretty nice.
Well when you put it that way, maybe I'll rent it sometime.
I'd be down for seeing it again. I saw it in theaters when it opened.
What about Despicable Me 3 though? Should we go see it?
Sure, let's go tomorrow night.
My favorite animted movie is still Wreck-It Ralph, though.
Then you're in luck, my friend. That one's getting a sequel to. I'll tlel you about it on the way.
