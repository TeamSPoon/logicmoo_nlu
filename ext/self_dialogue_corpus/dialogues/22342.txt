Did you catch the latest Jurasic Park?
Some of it.
Why only some?
Didn't really get into that much.
I thought it was pretty gripping.
I think there are way to many sequals these day.
Fair enough, but some of them are really good.
Such as...?
Men In Black
The second one was awful.
But the third one is my favorite.
That was a pretty good show.
I really like the younger guy who played K.
Yeah, what's his name?
Josh Brolin.
Oh, yeah. He's pretty good.
I know! Did you see No Country for Old Men?
I did. Tommy Lee Jones was in that.
I wonder if that's how Brolin got the MIB gig.
Probably.
