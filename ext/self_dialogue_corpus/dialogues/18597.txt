What is your favorite type of music?
I don't really have one. I like classic rock though.
Oh, I love classic rock. The Doors are great.
I love the doors! Morrison had such a good voice.
Did you know he was buried in Paris?
I did actually, I went to see his grave once.
Speaking of France, do you like Edith Piaf?
The short woman? Oh her voice was amazing.
You know who I have been listening to a lot lately?
No, who?
Florence and the Machine. That woman is haunting.
I know! My favorite album is Ceremonials.
She has so many good songs, I can't even think of one I like the most!
I can. Cosmic Love, hands down.
You have great taste. Another good song by her is the Drumming song.
I forgot about that one, you are right.
I wish I could see her perform live one day.
Wouldn't that be great? I bet she puts on a good performance.
Maybe one day I will get to see her.
You better bring me along with you!
