If I said the name Reginald Kenneth Dwight to you, would you know who I was talking about?
Is that your long lost uncle?
Ha! I wish.
You're going to tell me that's Paul McCartney's real name aren't you?
Close. That's Elton John's real name.
I'm not surprised he changed it, but mind you, Elton isn't really a normal pop star name either...
What's your favorite Elton John song then?
There's too many to mention, "I'm still standing" is quite timeless though. You?
"Sorry seems to be the hardest word" I think. Great tune and lyrics.
I remember the video for that, all mournful face, eyebrows making pyramids in his forehead. He could be an actor.
I always wanted to be able to play "Your song" on piano.
My embarrassing secret is that I d never heard that song before the Moulin Rouge film.
That's ok. For some reason he's never had the respect or constant radio play of the Beatles despite many classic songs.
Very true and it's the same for the Rolling Stones. If they'd stopped 40 years ago they'd be utterly revered.
I've always thought Jagger and Richards are more influential in music than Lennon and McCartney.
I'd agree. You only have to listen to their "greatest hits" album, it's song after song of perfection.
What's that album called again?
"40 Licks". There's playlists of it on Spotify if you've not got it already.
I think I had it on CD but you've just reminded me to have another listen.
Happy to be of assistance! It's only rock 'n' roll but I like it...
