Have you heard of Hinder?
No who are they?
They are a rock group, they have that sing Lips of an Angel.
Oh yeah, now I know who your talking about. Its been awhile since I heard that band.
I actually went to a concert of theirs one time.
How was it?
It was really good, they actually sound great live.
Thats cool, did you get any autographs?
No, they didn't do a signing.
That sucks, I like to collect signatures.
One thing that was funny though was that the band collected bras.
What? Bras?
Yes, I'm not even making this up.
You can't be serious?
Haha, I am. I guess that is a thing, for Hinder fans to throw their bras onto the stage.
Thats kind of weird.
They would hang them off their instruments to the point that they were completely cover.
That is hilarious. I wish I could have seen what that looked like.
A girl I was with even took her bra off and threw it on stage.
No way. Now I really wish I was there.
