I think they made too many Rocky movies
I didnt like any of them
Did you see any of them?
I saw all of them
OH OK, well I think they should have stopped after the 2nd one.
No they should have made one and then been done with it.
Who made the call do you think?
It was definitely Stallone's call.
He really didnt do anything else.
He had Rambo to do.
Oh yeah I forgot about that.
And other action movies that were bombs.
I still love the concept.
I am from Philadelphia so I have to hear about the movie all the time.
Adrian played a great wife role.
Well thats a stretch.
I loved the scene where he ran through the art museum steps.
Thats the worst in my opinion.
Why?
I dont know because it became campy to do and too tourist-y.
