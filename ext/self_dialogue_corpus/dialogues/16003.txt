What are you listening to these days?
I'm totally in love with Francesco Renga at the moment.
Who is that? What does he sing?
He's an Italian pop singer.
I've never listened to Italian pop music.
Listen to his album Scrivero il tuo nome on Spotify. It's really good.
What kind of music is it?
Just really catchy mainstream pop. He's got a really nice voice.
I think the only Italian album I have is by Andrea Bocelli. But I think I lost it.
He's one of Italy's biggest exports musically.
I really liked classical and operatic stuff.
Francesco actually did a classical-type album as well.
Did her really? Was it good?
Well I think you would like it more than I did.
What is it called?
Orchestraevoce. It's got a bunch of covers on it.
It would be cool to expand my collection.
And it's always good to have music in other languages.
That's true. I only have English and Spanish at the moment.
We should have a music night. I'll introduce you to some stuff!
