So, what's up? Are you glad it's Friday.
I'm so glad. I'm so ready for the weekend.
Yeah? Are you doing anything interesting?
I might go and see a movie.
Is there anything good playing?
There's a lot out, actually.
Yes. I've been seeing a lot of movie trailers lately.
Yep. There's Wonderwoman, Pirates of the Carribean, Guardians of the Galaxy and a bunch more.
Well, Wonderwoman is a bit of a change, I guess.
Yeah. I kind of feel like they just keep remaking old movies.
Yes. They remake them or do sequels constantly.
Wonderwoman hasn't really been done in such a long time.
Also, there's the Aquaman movie.
I heard about that. It's supposed to be a whole new twist on that superhero.
Yes, and they haven't really done an Aquaman movie yet.
He has dark hair and looks completely different for the new movie.
It's funny how far they've come with superhero movies.
They've been making them since those old black and white Superman movies.
Think of all the money they spend to make one of those movies these days.
Yeah. It's hard to imagine they even spent much money on Superman's costume in those old black and white movies.
