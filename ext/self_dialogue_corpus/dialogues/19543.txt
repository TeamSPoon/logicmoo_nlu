Who is your favorite pop artist?
Probably Lady Gaga.
Why Lady Gaga?
I like that she stands for people's rights.
Oh, thats a good reason.
Who is your favorite?
I like Taylor Swift.
Yea she has some good music.
Yea she does, but I also like Justin Timberlake.
Oh for sure. Justin Timberlake is one of the best.
Yea, he's come such a long way from his nsync days.
Yea, I really never thought he'd make it after they fell apart.
Well, I think they only fell apart because he quit.
Yea probably. Speaking of justin's what about Justin Beiber?
Oh I'm not a big fan of his, althought I do like that song "Sorry".
Yea that's a good song, and so is "Love Yourself".
Oh yea, that song is pretty amazing. I listen to it all the time.
So do I, I saw a youtube video of a music teacher performing it with her class and it was great.
But you know, the all time best is definitely Michael Jackson.
No way, that music is too  old.
