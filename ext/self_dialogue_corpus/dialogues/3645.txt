Did you watch the first Cloverfield movie?
Yes but I liked the second one better
The second one?
Yes, 10 Cloverfield Lane.
I watched that. It was probably one of the stranger movies I seen.
Why do you say that?
It was like two different movies in one.
Oh with the kidnapping and then the aliens.
yes, I didn't see the last part coming.
I didn't either. It was one of the stranger movies I have ever watched.
