Have you ever seen Amusement?
No, is that a comedy film?
It's actually more of a thriller type flick.
What a funny name for a thriller.
Yeah, it's like a series of little horror stories.
What is it about?
Each vignette is about something different. Once is about a clown who kidnaps a babysitter.
I think I've seen another thriller film like that before.
It's based on The Babysitter and the Man Upstairs.
Yes, that's it! What a creepy story!
