My son-in-law's birthday is coming up in two months, and I was trying to think what to get him for a present.
What kind of things does he like?
He loves movies, and has a bunch of dvds. For his last birthday, I bought him three dvds, and he loved them so much.
Which movies did you get him?
"Smokey and The Bandit," "Smokey and the Bandit 2," and "Pitch Perfect 2."
I love Burt Reynolds. "Smokey and the Bandit" was hilarious.
He watches those all the time. So I was trying to think what movies I could buy him that he would like as much as those.
Does he like Adam Sandler? Burt Reynolds was in "The Longest Yard" with Adam Sandler, and it was pretty good.
He has that one already, He has all the Adam Sandler movies. He also has every movie Will Smith has been in, and the "Rush Hour" movies.
Hmm. Oh, I know- what about "Cannonball Run?" Burt Reynolds was in that, and it was a comedy. I think there were two of those movies.
I forgot about those movies. Wasn't Dom DeLuise in those? He was in "Smokey and The Bandit 2."
Yes, he was. Oh, you know who else was in "Cannonball Run?" Jackie Chan. You said he had all the "Rush Hour" movies.
I don't remember Jackie Chan being in that movie. It's been so long since I saw it, I really don't even remember the movie that well.
It's about a cross country race in their cars.
Oh, he will love that then. He likes car movies, he has all the "Fast and Furious" movies.
You could probably find the dvd on Amazon and order it for him, they have all kinds of old movies on dvd on Amazon.
That is a great idea, thank you so much!
Just make sure you order them early, because sometimes shipping takes awhile.
I will, amd I'm going to look and see if there was a "Cannonball Run" sequel and order that too.
I'm pretty sure there was, and you should be able to find it on Amazon.
