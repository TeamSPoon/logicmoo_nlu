What did you think of Dredd?
The one with Karl Urban or the one with Sylvester Stallone?
The 2012 one.
Didn't see it.
Seriously? It was a pretty good movie.
I thought it looked cheap.
That's not a good excuse. It's pretty faithful to the source material.
The comics? I haven't read them.
The action is pretty brutal and stylish.
That's one positive.
It also has some pretty good actors. Karl Urban, Olivia Thurlby, Lena Headey.
From Game of Thrones?
Yeah, she plays a drug lord.
That's unexpected.
It's awesome.
Well you seem pretty excited.
So want to watch it?
I have nothing better to do.
You won't regret it.
Here's hoping.
