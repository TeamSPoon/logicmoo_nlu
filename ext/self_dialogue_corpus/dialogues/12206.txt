I was reading the other day that Yoda's toes change.
Toes change?  That makes no sense.
Let me explain more.  Depending on the movie you're watching, the number of toes he has changes.
That's a very interesting fact.
Guess how many toes he has in Phantom Menace
Two?
Three actually.  Guess how many in all the other movies?
Four?
Correct!  Apparently it was a change for when they redeveloped the costume suit.
You would have thought they would have kept it the same for continuity purposes.
