My friend at work mentioned a movie called Tangled. Do you think my daughter would like it for her birthday?
Definitely, I think she'd love it.
What's it about?
It's the story of Rapunzel.
Is that the Princess with the long hair in the tower?
Yep, that's the one.
Okay. When did it release?
I want to say 2010, but I'm not sure.
I'll check it out, thanks.
You're welcome.
