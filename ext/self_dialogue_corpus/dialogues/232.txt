Who is the best Hulk?
I'm thinking Edward Norton; I really liked his portrayal.
It was definitely better than Eric Bana's version.
Let's never speak of that again. I assume you like Mark Ruffalo the most?
Yeah, his character definitely fits the comics in the best way.
I haven't read any of the comics, so I don't have that to go on. Why him over Edward Norton?
Edward didn't really come off as the tech genius who figures out gamma rays. he doesn't portray enough anger on screen to justify the transformation.
Are you looking forward to seeing Hulk in Thor 3?
Sort of. I really want to know how he got to the planet and how he became a fighting slave.
Maybe it has something to do with how SHIELD ended, with everyone going into space. Perhaps they're looking for him.
