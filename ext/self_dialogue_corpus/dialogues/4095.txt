What is your favorite thriller about serial killers?
That's a really tough question, I would have to think about it.
Well, anyway, mine is Silence of The Lambs.
Wow, that is a great one. It's really intense too.
Yeah, it is. Do you remember the scene where he beats the two guards and escapes?
Of course! That part was crazy.
He literally took one of the guys faces off and wore it.
Yeah, and the paramedics actually took him out thinking he was one of the guards.
That was so ingenious and disgustingly perfect.
Yeah the main character in that movie is truly insane.
