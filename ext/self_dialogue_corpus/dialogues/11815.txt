Do you ever listen to the Beatles?
Of course. I love, "In My LIfe, I Love You More."
Rubber Soul was a great album.
What other songs were on that album? Do you know?
We Can Work It Out and Day Tripper.
Nice! I think my favorite album was Yellow Submarine.
I like their early stuff better. Hard to beat Let It Be.
I agree.
They'll never be another band like the Beatles.
Right. The right band at the right time.
