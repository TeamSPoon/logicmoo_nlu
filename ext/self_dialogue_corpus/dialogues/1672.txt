Who do you think is the most overhyped player in the NFL?
Ohhh thats a tough one.
Personally I have to go with Brady
What? Are you crazy?
Well hear me out....
K.
He has a ton of weapons that are big and fast
But very unregarded and undrafted
He has a coach that is brilliant
The coach isn't making the plays
He has a team built around his strengths
Every QB wishs this.
Who is yours?
I would say Russel Wilson
Um I can kind of get that.
I can't stand the guy. He runs and throws but he makes terrible decisions
I would have more grey hair then I already do if i played for him
For sure!
He can make the plays.
No doubt, but he can make boneheded moves too
