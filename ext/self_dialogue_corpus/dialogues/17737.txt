Yo! Let's do a jam session sometime.
What's a jam session.
Where we just start making music together, impromptu.
Oh I would suck at that.
You don't need to be good to jam. You play any instruments?
I played piano once when I was kid.
Perfect! Let's get you on a piano and just start playing.
I don't really remember how to play though. It's been a while.
I'm telling you it doesn't matter. Come here let's go to the piano
Okay.
Alright I'll start by giving you a beat.
Okay, what do I do now?
It's easy just start playing in any key.
Like this?
Exactly. See this isn't too bad right?
I guess so. Now what do I do?
Start changing up the keys!
Okay. Hey this is kind of fun.
You bet. And the better we get at it, the faster we can make a mix tape.
Yeah funny.
