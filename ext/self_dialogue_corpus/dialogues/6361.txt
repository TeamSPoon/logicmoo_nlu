What is your favorite disney princess?
I don't know, I tend to like the villains.
Really?
Definitely, they feel more dynamic for some reason.
For example?
Scar from Lion King.
I love Scar!
I do too, he deserves his own movie.
I know, right!
I want to know what happened to him to make him how he was by the start of Lion King.
