Do you think Paul McCartney is the best Beatle?
That is impossible to tell.
Why?
Because it is entirely subjective. For example, I like Ringo the best.
Really? What song do you like the most of his?
Yellow Submarine.
Col. I thought everyone liked Paul.
A lot of people do. But, that does not mean he is the best.
True.
John Lennon is also pretty amazing and so is George.
