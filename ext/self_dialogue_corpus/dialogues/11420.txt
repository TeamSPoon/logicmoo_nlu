Have you ever heard the song "All You Need Is Love"?
The Beatles song, right?
Right. I was just thinking that that song is as relevant today as it was back then.
What do you mean?
Well, love really is all we need. It was true then, and it's definitely true now.
Agreed. The Beatles wrote some really insightful songs, didn't they?
They did! What I love about them is they covered the entire spectrum of human emotion.
That's definitely true. It's no wonder they're still so popular.
Yeah, part of that is due to an incredible amount of musical talent. But more than that, they put out songs that people could truly relate to.
I know. I should really listen to them more often
