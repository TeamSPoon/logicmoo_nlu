Here's a good icebreaker: What's your favorite Beatles song?
OMG. I love them all. I couldn't name just one.
But if you had to, what would it be?
Well, I really like "Hey Jude".
Oh, that's a great one. Mine is "Yesterday".
That's almost a standard. Definitely a classic.
Yeah, I tend to like Paul's songs more than the others. Paul McCartney is a genius songwriter.
He sure is. I think he got the short end of things when compositions were credited always as "Lennon/McCartney".
I agree. Another favorite song of mine is "Penny Lane".
That has Paul McCartney written all over it. Great choice.
