I need to get some new movies for the kids. I am so sick of watching the same Minions movie over and over.
Have you seen any of the Studio Ghibli movies?
Hmmm. I'm not really sure.
Have you heard of My Neighbor Totoro?
You know, I have. I have not seen it, though. Neither have the kids. Is it good?
It's excellent. It can be a bit hard to find on streaming sites. I find with Studio Ghibli, it's best to just buy the DVDs. They are never on Neflix.
No problem. I like to have buy DVDs anyway.
If you like My Neighbor Totoro, there are other films put out by that studio that you should check out, too. The films are really beautifully animated with excellent storylines. They come out of Japan.
Oh. My kids can't read subtitles, yet.
That's not a problem. You can find them dubbed in English. Just make sure you are buying the dubbed version.
Okay. I am on Amazon. What should I put in my cart? I need some stuff for summer vacation.
My Neighbor Totoro, like I said. Also, Kiki's Delivery Service is really good.
Okay. That looks cute, too.
It's really sweet. It's about a young witch who goes out into the world to come of age. It's really lovely.
Okay. What else? I see one hear called Spirited Away. Is that good?
It's excellent but it probably won't appeal to very young kids. It has a more complicated storyline. Do your kids get scared easily?
No. They love Halloween and spooky things. Why? Is it scary?
It has some scary moments and some pretty creepy villains. Also, it deals with the spirit world, so the kids need to have some sort of understanding of death.
They do. You think it would be okay for age 8 and 9?
I personally think so. It's a brilliant movie. In our house, it is our all-time favorite animated film. Get Ponyo, too. It's cute!
