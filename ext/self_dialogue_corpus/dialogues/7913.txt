who is your favorite Hip-hop star?
Rihanna is currently dominating my spotify.
I enjoy her music, especially her recent hit "Work".
I still get  "Umbrella" tuck in my head all the time.
She adds a great energy to her music which is part of the reason most of it is so catchy.
Did you know Rihanna had her first top 100 hit 12 years ago?
No, I did not know that what was the song.
Considering she is 27 years old so she has been making music for a long time. The song was called "Pon de Replay".
I have never heard it but I will give it a listen.
You should give her early work a chance most of is as great as her current work.
