Have you seen any good movies lately?
I just watched the remake of dirty dancing.
How was it?
It was okay, nothing special
Was it as good as the first one?
Definitely not
No one can replace John travolta
No, once he does a part, there's no meeting it, he sets the bar high
Definitely, I still want to see it out of curiosity though
That's exactly why I watched it
I just watched the boss
Who is in that?
Melissa mccarthy
Oh I bet it was good then
Yes it was really funny
I'll have to watch it
Yes it's definitely worth watching
Any other good movies worth watching
Central intelligence?
I haven't seen that either
