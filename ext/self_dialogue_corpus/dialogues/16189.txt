Are you a fan of music festivals?
Yeah, I think they're fun!
I always like seeing musical artists on the line up.
Agreed, it gets me excited to attend one and see them.
I feel like they're such a different experience from a concert.
Yeah, I've been to festivals in the past and its a different experience.
Really, which one?
I went to Lalapolozza a couple years ago and saw all kinds of artists.
Like who?
The Ready Set, Panic at the Disco, so many bands, really.
Nice! Have you been to any other music festivals?
Yeah, have you heard of Sunset?
No, where is that?
Well, I think it's in different places but I went to one in Orlando.
Wow, that's awesome! Who performed?
Too many peopel to count, I can tell you that.
I bet, that place must've had tons of people.
Yep! I remember that Srillex was there though.
Really! How was he?
He sounds just like his albums!
