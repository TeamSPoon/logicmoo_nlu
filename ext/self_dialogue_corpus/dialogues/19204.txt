What kind of music are you in to?
A little bit of this, a little bit of that.
Yeah, me too I suppose!
Why do you ask?
There's a Glass Animals show in October of this year.
Cool, I've actually heard of them!
Are they something you like?
Yeah definitely.
Awesome! Would you want to go with me?
Well, I'd feel kind of weird cause I don't know many songs!
Don't worry about it! I think they're a fairly new band, so probably most people probably don't know many songs.
Cool, then!
I think I'm gonna buy tickets tonight.
Could you get one for me too? I'll listen to all their albums on replay tonight!
Sounds good! Have you ever heard of Sylvan Esso?
I think so, but I'm not positive. Why?
They're pretty similar in sound.
Oh nice!
Sylvan Esso just recently came out with a new album too.
Awesome. I have a lot of homework for tonight!
