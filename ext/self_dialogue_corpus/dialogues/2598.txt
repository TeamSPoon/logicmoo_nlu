Why is nobody talking up the Ravens right now?
What do you mean exactly?
It just seems like nobody is giving them much of a shot this year.
The Ravens are just an okay team, that's why.
But they've got some good players.
Aging players maybe.  Some of their better guys are past their prime.
I think Joe Flacco is still a top five QB.
There's a lot wrong with that statement.  He's not even top ten.
But he won a Super Bowl.
Yeah, five years ago.  League has changed since then.
Just saying that you're sleeping on his potential.
Nope, they overpaid him and he's never produced that well again.
Well, they'll be better than you think.
Not with that aging defense.
What are you talking about.
Weddle, Suggs, old, old, old.
They're crafty veterans.  Those guys make the team better.
They don't have the defense they used to.
Sure, not unless you're bringing back Ray Lewis.
I don't have a time machine to do that.
