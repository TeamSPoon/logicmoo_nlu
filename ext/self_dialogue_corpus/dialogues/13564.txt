how strong was sidius anyway
i dont think he was that powerful
he lost to mace windu.
he might have just been pretending so anakin would save him
he looked pretty pained though. i dont know.
he got killed by vader pretty easily though.
he also killed vader back though.
vader was already weak though.
thats true.
i guess he wasnt that tough
