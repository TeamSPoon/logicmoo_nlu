What is one of your favorite Disney movies?
I love The Lion King.
Me too! What's your favorite part?
When one of the Hyena's says Mufasa and the other hyena starts cracking up laughing.
Oh I love that part!
I also love when Timon and Pumbaa do the distraction with the song and dance. So funny!
I love Pumbaa. That's my favorite character.
My favorite character is Rafiki.
The Lion King is defenitly one of my favorites.
