Have you seen all the remakes of some of the Disney Classics?
Yes I did.
Which ones were your favorite?
Alice in Wonderland, Beauty and the beast, and Malificent which was suppose to be the Snow White remake.
Those were my favorite too. I wish they would make one for Little Mermaid or Peter Pan.
Those would be great Disney remakes.
I think if they remade The Little mermaid the part where she turns her fin into legs would be the most crucial part.
I disagree, I think the part where she needs to kiss the prince before the sunset would be.
You're right, I think Jessica CHastain would make a great Ariel and Henry Cavil as Prince Eric.
Both great choices! I agree.
