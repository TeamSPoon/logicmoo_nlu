So have you heard Mandisa's new hit?
No I haven't.
She put a new hit out.
I haven't heard from her in awhile.
Apparently, she was through a serious depression.
What Mandisa? I love her and she always seems so happy.
From what I heard it was serious.
She never really seemed as if she was depressed.
That was part of what she was saying on the radio the other day. She was able to put a face on and nobody knew.
You would think those close to her would have known. But I mean she seems to have it all.
She went on to say that she had gained a lot of her weight back and that sent her into a very dark place.
So those close to her didn't even know?
No, that is what she went on to say. For the longest time she faked it.
Depression can put you into a real bad spot. So how did she overcome it?
She had lots of prayer and she got some counselling.
Amazing how she seemed to have it all. Fame and wealth.
Just goes to show that depression can hit anyone at anytime
I would say so.
Her new song she tells of how she has overcome her illness. And how she has come through.
I can't wait to hear it.
