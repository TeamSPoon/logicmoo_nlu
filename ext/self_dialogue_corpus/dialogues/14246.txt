Have you been following the Celtics and Wizards series?
Yeah, it's been pretty incredible so far.
Who do you think is going win?
I think the Celtics will take it in seven games.
I hope they do but the Wizards have been pretty tough the past few games.
Yeah they have. But Boston has home court advantage.
Yeah all the games have been won by the home team this series.
What do you think about Kelly Oubre getting suspended?
I think he deserved it. It was a bad choice to push Olynyk like that.
Yeah, he should have just backed off.  The pick was hard but legal.
Do you think either team stands a chance against the Cavaliers next round?
I don't know. I think they might win a game or two but the Cavaliers are really good.
Yeah, The Celtics would have home court in that series, do you think that would make a difference.
Yeah a slight one but I still think the Cavaliers would win.
Who do you think is gonna come out of the West?
I think the Warriors for sure.
I think the Rockets could possibly beat the Warriors but probably not.
Yeah. I think the Spurs are too old and too injured to keep winning in the playoffs.
Yeah. I had them winning this series with the Rockets but now I'm not sure.
We'll see in the next few days.
