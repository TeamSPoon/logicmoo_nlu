What are your favorite music genres?
I find myself drawn to Swing/Big Band from he 30's/40's and 70's AM radio music.
Tell me about what makes you like Swing/Big Band.
"Sing, Sing, Sing" is without a doubt the most exciting instrumental Swing song I have heard.
What is so exciting about that song?
The percussion lead-in at the beginning practically compells you to tap your feet and get ready to dance.
How does the rest of the song move you?
The brass section with the trombones really makes one sway when dancing and the tempo has interesting stops and starts.
So tell me about the 70's AM radio music.
It is the music of my childhood that seems like a playlist for my life.
How so?
"Dreamweaver"  always made me smile because I felt like I was the subject that were singing about.
What other music from that era made you feel that way?
Pretty much anything that the Carpenters sang was so pleasant to the ears, especially "Close to You".
What made it so pleasant?
Karen Carpenter's voice had perfect tone and phrasing. Only Ella Fitzgerald was somewhat better.
What group was your favorite during that time?
I'm torn between Chicago and Boston.
Make a choice.
If I just had to choose then I would go with Chicago because of the song "Saturday in the Park".
