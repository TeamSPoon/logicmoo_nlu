Don't you think there are some magic in the lyrics of The Beatles?
yea, I think most of the lyrics in their songs are well thought and trying to spread out a positive message to the world
yeah, I'm so glad a band like that exist
yeah, what are some of your favorite songs from them>
They really have tons of great songs, I particularly like Let It Be
what a surprise, that's my personal favorite asd well
I just feel a song like that is good for a lot of occasions, when I'm down I also listen to them
That would make you feel much better, doesn't it
oh yeah, I hope The Beatles still publishing songs
but I'm afriad time passed.
