Hey, heard any good music recently?
Yeah, I'm really digging Twenty One Pilots
Oh, sounds vaguely familiar.
You'll probably recognize some of their songs. They're played quite a bit on radio.
Oh, okay.
There's a song called Stressed Out that's really popular.
That sounds a bit familiar
It won a Grammy as well. They also have a song called Heathens.
Oh wait, was that in the movie Suicide Squad?
Yes, that's the one.
Ah okay. Now I know who you're talking about.
Yeah, I'm digging their music now. Good duo.
Where are they from?
I think they're from Columbus, OH
Really? I would never have guessed.
Yeah, fairly new. Formed in 2009.
I'll have to check out some of their work.
Yeah, I know they play some of their songs a lot at the gym I go to.
Ha! Like a top 40 type list.
Yeah, something like that.
