I really loved the Harry Potter movies, but I wish we could've learned more about some of the characters. They're fascinating.
Like who?
Lily, for one. We know she was Snape's friend, James's wife, and Harry's mother, but we never get to know her as an individual.
Well, she was obviously kind and willing to do anything for the people she loved.
I know, but it feels like we learned a lot more about James than we did about her.
Yeah, I guess she was a pretty important character, wasn't she?
Her sacrifice basically saved the Wizarding world, so yeah.
She does deserve a lot of credit for that.
I agree. I've always seen her and Snape as the two biggest saviors, perhaps even more than Harry himself.
I can see that.
