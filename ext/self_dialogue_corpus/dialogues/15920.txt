Have you ever heard of Dead Prez?
I think so.
Do you remember their music?
They had that one famous song.
It is called It's Bigger than Hip Hop.
Oh yes, I remember now.
They have the most amazing lyrics.
What do they rap about?
They rap about life, how they relate to the world around them, they go deep.
I like powerful lyrics in music.
Yes I do too, I like when it sounds great too, of course.
Yes the combination is so sweet.
Yes Dead Prez' lyrics and songs are like books on tape.
Wow I need to listen to them.
Yes they have changed over the years too, their newer stuff is different than their older stuff.
I like that, it shows growth.
Yes especially when both styles are great music.
Yes I agree.
Give them a listen, listen to the lyrics.
Ok thank you for telling me about them.
