Does the Hulk get his own movie ever again?
No hes had enough
So you think hes just a side character now?
Yeah for the most part.
Thats a shame he had a good story to tell.
Its always the same thing though.
In what manner?
He has a curse and doesnt want to be the Hulk
Oh I see what you are saying
It makes the movies absolute trash.
