Wow, the last 2 years we have lost so many great musicians....
Oh yeah, like who?
Well for starters, David Bowie, Prince, Chuck Berry. For Starters.
Really, where have I been?
I don't know but those are some major players.
I can't believe Prince is dead. That's crazy.
Yeah, losing David Bowie was a big blow.
Ziggy Stardust....man, he's been around forever.
And Chris Cornell died too and he was only 52.
Who is that?
Lead singer to Sound Garden. The grunge of the 90's.
I kind of remember them but I wasn't in that music except Nirvana.
Really Nirvana, you're so mainstream.
Yeah, better than Pearl Jam. Eddie Vedder totally sold out.
Well, that's only because Kurt Cobain died, he would have sold out eventually too. Think of all that music we missed.
Yeah, but better to burn up than burn out.
I guess. But their music was pretty good. I'll admit. Can't beat Nevermind as an album. Best of that genre.
Yeah and Jeremy on 10 by Pearl Jam. That is some of the best music.
Even though Eddie Vedder sold out, he does have an amazing voice.
One of my favorite songs by them is Animal. It's a cool song.
