Did you enjoy going to the Pittsburgh Penguins and Ottawa Senators game on Saturday?
It was great, especially since my Senators won.
I saw it was 1-0 in the 3rd period, what was the final score?
The Penguins tied it up and they went to overtime.
So the Senators won in overtime?
Yeah, they ended up winning 2-1.
Aren't you glad I talked you into buying the ticket?
Heck yeah, the chance to see my team play in the playoffs was awesome!
You going to buy a ticked for game 2?
No, can't justify the money to purchase another ticket.
Did the Pittsburgh fans give you any trouble?
No, they were all pretty nice, for the most part?
For the most part?
Yeah, once the game was over, I got yelled at some because I was wearing a Senators jersey.
How was the arena?
It was an arena.   Nothing special.
When's game 2 anyway?
Monday night, don't remember what time.
You going to go to a bar to watch it?
No, I'll probably watch from home.
