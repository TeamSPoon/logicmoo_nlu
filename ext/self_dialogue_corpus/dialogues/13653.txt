What was your least favorite Star Wars movie?
I would say Episode one.
Yes, it was a little too political.
It had it's good points though, the light saber battle was amazing.
It was, and to see the Jedi order and full working of the Galactic Senate was impressive.
Liam Neeson as Qui con Gin also brought a new image of the Jedi order.
Seeing a young Obi Wan was also fun.
But we can't let it slide, Jar Jar was a bit of a mistake.
And the age gap between Pademe and Anikan was a little odd.
But overall it was a good movie, I just with they would have kept Darth Maul.
