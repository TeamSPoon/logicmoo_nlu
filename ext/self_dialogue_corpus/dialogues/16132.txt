Hey, what's your opinion on Kendrick Lamar?
Oh man. I think Kendrick is the best rapper of all time.
Whoa. I like him but I don't know if I would go that far.
I would. Everything he releases is just top tier. What's your favorite album by him?
Mine is "To Pimp a Butterfly". What's yours?
Mine is "Damn". It is so close though between yours, mine and then "Good Kid, MAAD City" that it isn't even funny.
True. My favorite probably chances every couple of months.
That's my point! That's why he's the greatest!
I'll wait a couple more albums before I put him before Nas and Andre 3000k.
Nas is whack man.
Oh really?! "Illmatic" is the best album every made.
I'm not going to argue that, I agree. "Life's a bitch" is the pinnacle of hip-hop.
Finally we can agree on something! Now I'm going to ask you a question that will determine the fate of your relationship.
What is it?
Do you know Devin the Dude?
I love Devin the Dude. I listened to him for about a year straight during my college years.
I'm glad you said that. Devin the Dude is your favorite rapper's favorite rapper.
Did we just become best friends?
Yes we did. I want to go listen to the new Young Thug album.
Sure. Meet you at your house in 30 minutes.
