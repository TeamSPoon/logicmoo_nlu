Hey what do you think about linkin park?
Oh I just love that band!
Me too. I mean I used to love them.
Why you used to love them? You don't love them now?
I mean I am not sure. It seems they have changed their genre.
What do you mean by that?
I mean they used to be rock band, now it seems they are more into techno.
That may be true, but I still love them.
I don't know, I mean there are lot of great techno bands out there.
So you mean linkin park can't compete them?
What I am saying is, why not stick to rock?
I guess they wanted to try something new.
Yes, I understand, But I still feel that their rock was way better than techno.
Have you listened to their latest album?
Which one was the latest? Thousand suns?
No, there has been one more album after thousand suns.
Oh, so what is the name of it?
I just keep forgetting name of it, I don't know why.
That's okay. I am just going to listen to their old album.
Oh okay. Sounds cool.
