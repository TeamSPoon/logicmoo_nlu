Did you like the Gungans?
They were mean to Jar Jar
He didn't do anything to deserve the way they treated him
He was made a general, but only after they treated him so badly
He was a funny guy
The head Gungan talked funny
We don't know exactly what Jar Jar did. The Gungans were made out to be sub human.
It was barbaric the way that they poked Jar Jar with the stick.
Their weapons were behind the times
Jar Jar was the best of them, even though his people treated him badly
