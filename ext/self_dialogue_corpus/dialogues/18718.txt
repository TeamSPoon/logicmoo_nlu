Do you listen to Lil Dicky?
Is that a joke question?
No, he's an actual rapper. He's great.
I have never heard of him. What's his biggest song?
Probably save dat money. It's about how frugal he is.
Thats like the opposite of what rappers rap about.
That's what's funny about him, he isn't your typical rapper.
So is he a funny rapper?
Yes, he's hilarious.
I listen to rap for the lyrics, not humor.
That's what's great about him. He's funny, but extremely lyrical.
Give me one of his lyrical raps.
Russell Westbrook on a farm. It's not a funny one.
I'll check that out.
Good, I hope you like him.
Where's he from? Age?
He's from PA. Late 20s.
OK, cool.
His main shtick is rapping about how Jewish and white he is.
I'll give him a shot.
