what disney movie do you think has the best bad guy?
oh that is a tough one, but im going to go with aladdin
oh Jafar from aladdin was bad to the bone
yeah he was, and he was super powerful once he got genie under his control
that is true, but there is a lesson to be learned from that
and what would that be exactly?
too much power is not a good thing, because that was what led to his downfall
yeah you are right, he became stronger than genie and it came back to hurt him
exactly now if only i could find a magical lamp
well if you do let me get at least one wish!
