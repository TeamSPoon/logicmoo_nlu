You know Walt Disney was a bit fan of Kurt Russel.
I wonder why?
I do not know, his name was the last thing he ever wrote.
Did Russel ever do any Disney movies/
Back when Disney made more live animation and a bit more recent.
Like what ones?
A more recent one was Sky High.
I had no idea that was even a Disney movie.
Yes, it was one of Daneilla Panabaker's first major film roles.
I loved Kelly Preston in that movie.
She was a good match for Russel.
I think Russel has good chemistry with his on screen co stars.
Did you ever see him in "Overboard"?
Is that the one with Goldie Hawn?
Yes, it is.
I thought that movie was so funny.
He and Hawn have the best chemsitry, just in the same scene.
I loved in the end they fell in love.
He did a lot of the romantic comedy around that time.
Like Winter People.
