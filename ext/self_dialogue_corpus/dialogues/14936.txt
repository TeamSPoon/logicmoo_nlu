Hey have you seen that movie "Ted"?
Yes it was freaking hilarious
I know right, Mark Wahlber who knew he could be so funny.
And the bear cracks me up also
Did you know that they made a 2nd movie as well "Ted 2"?
No I didn't know I guess i'm going to be looking in my Netflix tonight
Yeah I would highly recommend that you look it up its almost as funny as the first movie
I will for sure
Well have a great night
You too see you tomorrow!
