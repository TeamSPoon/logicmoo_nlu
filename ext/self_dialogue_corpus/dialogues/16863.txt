Did you see Lady Gaga at the Superbowl last year?
She was awesome.
I know right?  She's one of the great talents of these days.
Yeah, I feel the same way.
One thing I've noticed is they just don't have as many brilliant talents anymore.
No they don't.  It's odd because the median level of music as come up.
Yeah, and the apex has come down.
You know what was a good Gaga song?  Alejadro.
I like that one a lot.  That and Perfect Allusion.
Yes, awesome song.
She's actually really talented.  She was great in American Horror Story.
Also agree with her or not, she uses her celebrity to make a difference in politics.
Yeah, and she's my next girlfriend.
Yeah yeah, haha.  Very funny.
You know what was a good song?
Most of them?
Yes, but specifically Poker Face.
Yeah, one of her best hits for sure.
It's kind of catchy.
Yeah, and she just has a great voice for everything she sings.
