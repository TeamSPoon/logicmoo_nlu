Who do you think is the best dressed actor in Hollwood?
Does it matter? Men wear the same thing.
Yeah but some guys dress like theyre poor
True, I guess I would say George Clooney.
I dont know if I could say that anymore, how about Ryan Gosseling?
Again I guess it all goes back to men wearing the same thing all the time.
OK turn to women then.
Hmm....Maybe Emma Stone?
I dont know that much about what she wears
She keeps it plain and normal, nothing too extravagant
You mean like Lady Gaga?
Sometimes I think she does it on purpose.
She is trying to look too much like Madonna did.
Yeah some of the outfits, I dont get it.
Kendall Jenner dresses nice.
Well shes a model so she has to wear all those weird outfits.
Does anyone actually buy them?
I think for the unique factor, yes.
Where do you start when designing those clothes?
I dont know I guess the trash can then you go from there.
