hey what do you think about star wars boot up?
what do you mean by star wars boot up?
I mean they have sort of rebooted star wars series with new movies like rogue one.
I thought rogue one was individual solo star wars movie rather than series reboot.
Yes, it was suppose to be solo but then there is already new star wars movie in production
But I am sure that upcoming movie is not going to be sequel of rogue one.
are you sure about that?
yes I am pretty sure.
Oh okay I guess I trust you on that.
I am glad to hear that.
