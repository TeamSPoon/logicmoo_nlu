I used to listen to Evanescence so much when I was younger.
Me too. Amy Lee has such a beautiful voice.
I know. She sounds amazing in Going Under.
Have they released any albums recently?
I don't know.
The last single of theirs that I remember was Lithium.
Wow, that song came out such a long time ago.
It was from their album Open Door.
I definitely think they are most popular for their album Fallen.
Oh, I agree. A lot of their hits came from that album.
What is your favorite song by them?
I like the song Hello. It sounds so haunting.
I agree. It makes me feel so melancholy when I listen to it.
I feel the same way about My Immortal.
Yes, that song is very emotional too.
What do you think of their song Bring Me To Life?
I like how fast paced it is.
Me too. Do you know who the guy singing backup vocals on it is?
I think it's Paul McCoy. He's in another band called 12 Stones.
Hm. I never knew that.
