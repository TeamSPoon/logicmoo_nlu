Have you ever seen the original Evil Dead?
Yes!  It was amazing and super creepy.
The apex of horror.
Funny thing is the sequels got progressively funny.
I know, there is debate on whether Evil Dead 2 is a sequel, a remake, or a semi-spoof.
Who knows.  I would say the title makes it a sequel.
Good point.  It was basically the same movie with comedy mixed in.
I know.  And basically ends where Evil Dead 3 begins.
That was a funny movie.
yeah it was.  Hail to the king.
I love at the end when he has to fight that demon in the regular world.
That was great.  Or when he's fighting evil him.
That was pretty good too.
All the cheesy one liners too.
Like "You're in charge of Jack and Sh*t, and Jack left town."
That's my favorite one.
Yeah, I actually say that to people all the time.
Ha, that's great.
You know, poor Bruce Campbell.  He's a fun guy in a lot of cheesy things.
He is but he does what he does well.
