Hey, what're you listening to?
I'm listening to Aphex Twin.
This sounds super weird and cool.
Yeah that's definitely his style.
Where are they from?
It's just one guy. His name is Richard David James and he's from the UK.
I've heard that the UK has a big electronic scene.
Yes, I believe that's where a lot of electronic music originated from.
What's another electronic artist from the UK?
There's a guy named Goldie that's really fantastic.
Is Goldie's music similar to Aphex Twin?
Goldie focuses more on jungle and drum and bass.
Oh cool. I've heard a couple of drum and bass songs before.
Yeah it's great. It has a lot of energy.
Have you ever been to an electronic concert?
Yes I've been to EDC and saw Skrillex there.
I've heard of Skrillex!
He's not my favorite but he has some cool tracks.
Can you recommend a good album from Aphex Twin?
Start with Selected Ambient Works 85â€“92 and take it from there.
