Have you seen a good movie lately
Yes, I seen Wizard of Lies.
Who was in that?
Robert DiNaro, I like him he is great
What else was he in?
Casino, have you seen that one?
Oh my gosh, I really liked that one. Sharon Stone was in it.
She was great in Basic Instinct.
I don't remember that one, but have you seen A Bronx Tale with Dinaro?
Yes, that was one of my favorite movies of all time.
I think that good looking young main character is still in jail.
I believe he was involved in a shooting during a home invasion or robbery
What a shame, he had a bright future. How about Good Fellas?
That was really good, with Ray Liotta
I love him in Shades of Blue? It's not a movie but a tv series.
I can't remember the last time I went to a movie.
Last time we went was to see Blow.
Who was in that one?
Johnny Depp.
Oh, I love him. Can't wait to see the new pirates.
