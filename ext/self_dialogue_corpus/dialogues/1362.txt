Who's the top high school football player in Pennsylvania?
That's a good question.
I think it is Trent Thompson.
He's got a lot of talent.
He's got a lot of stamina and is very strong.
He can tackle anyone.
He is stacked.
I think he can mentally take on the pros.
He physically is ready as well.
With a few years in the college scene he could be the next Kyle Williams.
I bet he could.
With the right mentoring and attitude he'll go far.
Yes, he will.
I think he'd be recruited by the Eagles.
They'd love to have him.
So would the Cowboys.
He has a lot of high hopes for the future.
Sure does.
I wish him all the best.
Me too, he deserves it.
