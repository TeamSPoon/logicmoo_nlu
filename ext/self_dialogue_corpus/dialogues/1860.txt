There are lot of interesting things about the NFL that I didn't know and probably a lot of people didn't know
Like what kinds of things are you referring to?
THE TOTAL AUDIENCE FOR THE FIRST TELEVISED FOOTBALL GAME IN 1939 WAS 500, ABOUT 112,200,500 LESS THAN WATCHED LAST YEARâ€™S SUPER BOWL.
That's amazing to think about you know.
How about this one. Carl Weathers that plays Apollo Creed in the Rocky movie played fro the Oakland Raiders for 2 seasons in the 1970's
That's pretty obscure but cool to know.
This is one I like a lot since I went to college there during this time.The UNIVERSITY OF GEORGIA liked THE GREEN BAY PACKERS helmet logo so much that coach Vince Dooley borrowed the look for their helemet
Is that an okay thing to do?
I suppose so ...he did it.
True. Tell me some more weird ones.
Okay let's see what I can come up with for you. Here you go. Guess how much the Super Bowl Trophy costs?
Ummm $3000
Way off! Try $25,000!
What!!!! Are you kidding me!
Here's a good one about the NFL football.
Lay it on me.
Wilson has been making them since 1941 at 4000 a day.
Just for the NFL?
Yes and one cowhide makes 10 footballs.
These are some pretty fun things to know.
