If you like Jodie Foster, you must see Silence of the Lambs.
I've always wanted to see it.  Tell me more.
It's about a serial killer.  He's played by Anthony Hopkins.
Oh, he's good.  Is he scary in this?
Yes, he is very scary.  You won't forget the performance.
Didn't he win an Oscar for that?
He did win an Oscar for the performance.  It's deserved.
Do Foster and Hopkins have a lot of chemistry?
I thought they had great chemistry.  They complement each other well, and it's an intelligent film.
I'll see it soon.  I like films with bite.
