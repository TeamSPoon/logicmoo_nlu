Did we see the window of opporunity close on the Cardinals?
No why would you think that?
Just losing more games now and the hitting isnt there.
Well they have alot of minor league turnover.
Yeah but its a well oiled machined.
I get it but you cant keep producing that kind of talent.
Eventually things even out, theyll be good.
Theyve been good for 20 some years, its probably time they dip.
While this could be true, I dont envision it happening.
Their minor league is so stocked its alarming.
Well thats where I think they are having issues.
What do you mean?
They arent developing guys like they used to.
I just think it takes longer. They need to move on from guys like Wainwright.
I think pitchers last longer they dont need to.
They peddled Garcia at the right time.
He hasnt done much in Atlanta.
Yeah but what they got for him hasnt paid off either.
Well that could take a while.
I dont think so, guys produce immediately nowadays.
