Do you know any old music?
Like, classic rock?
Yes, like classic rock, like the Beatles or Thunder Rose.
I don't think I heard of Thunder Rose, who were they?
They were a psychedalic band from the 1960s. Nirvana covered a lot of their work.
I only heard "White Lace and Strange" on their box set.
Yes, that might have been the only one.
Do you like Led Zepplin?
Yes, I love "Stairway to Heaven". Krist Novecelic said he listened to a lot of it growing up.
What's up with that lawsuit they were in a while ago?
Led Zepplin?
Yes.
Some unknown band in the 1960s said they stole a riff for "Stairway to Heaven."
Did they?
A court said they didn't.
Do you think they did?
It's really close, to be honest. I couldn't say no for sure.
Didn't that band even open for Led Zepplin?
I think that was used in court as evidence.
Wow. I think they got burned.
