You know what else needs more information?
Let me guess, you're gonna tell me.
Yes. Count Dooku.
Count Dooku falls to the dark side after QuiGon Jin dies.
And that shouldn't make sense.
Why not? maybe he was made more sensitive to Sith's tactics by his sadness
So the story, then, is what? This Jedi knight is so saddened by the death of his former apprentice, he become a sith?
Seems likely...
No it's not likely.
Well, maybe Darth Sidious used some dark force magic to turn him. Anyway, that's not that exciting. He dies anyway.
