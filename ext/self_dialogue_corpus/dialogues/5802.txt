Did you catch the Jimi Hendrix reference in Cars?
When Sarge was raising his flag?
Yes! When he told Filmore to turn that disrespectful stuff off.
Respect the classics, man!
That was hilarious.
One of my favorite scenes.
The hippie and the Military man.
Yet, they are best friends.
In their own way.
Cars is filled with great moments like that.
