I heard Taylor Swift is real mean in real life.
Wouldn't surprise me.
There was a rumor going around that her next song will be about her breakup with Tom Hiddleston.
She's broken up with everyone else alive.
Not me, at least not yet.  I look forward to it.
Why does she feel the need to publish that stuff?
You mean stay in the spotlight.
Yeah, what's wrong with being normal.
Nothing is normal when you're Taylor Swift though.
She brings it upon herself.
How so?
She's always in front of the cameras.
I get that, but what else?
She has this incessant need to be relevant and start fights.
Didn't she start a fight with some other singer?
Yeah, I don't even remember who it was.
But I think that one song she wrote was about a beef.
Man, what was the name of that song?
I think it was Bad Blood.
Yeah, that's it!
