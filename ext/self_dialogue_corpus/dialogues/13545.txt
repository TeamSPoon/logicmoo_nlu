What did you think about the Jedi?
They were great in Attack of the Clones
They were the central part of the movies
I wouldn't mind the movies being just about them
There was some politics and a bunch of fighting
Did you like the lightsaber duels?
Some of them were cool.
I felt bad for the Jedi in episode 3
they didn't rebuild what they had after that
That was sad
