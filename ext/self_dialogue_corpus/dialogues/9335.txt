My favorite Tupac song always been "Keep Your Head Up" because he was speaking highly about women in urban America
True, I liked that song also. Being that my favorite rapper is Biggie, my favorite song is "Sky is the Limit."
Kendrick Lamar is what's hot right now. Have you heard that song "Humble" ?
Yeah, I heard it. But I like his album "To Pimp a Butterfly" better.
I think K Dot is bringing back real hip hop back to life. His bars are phenomenal!!
I feel that. So what do you think about female rappers?
I personally like Nicki Minaj. I get hyped when I hear her song "Did It On Them."
That track was cool, but "Shether" by Remy Ma blew that out the water.
Aren't Remy and Nicki beefin' right now? I mean they both are cool to me.
Yeah, man. That whole battle with the back and forth between these two ladies is getting real ugly.
