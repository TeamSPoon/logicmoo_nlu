What's your favorite movie?
Superman
Which one?
The first one
LIke from way back when?
Yea!
That one was one of the best
I agree
Many of the modern iterations can't live up to that one
I totally agree
Did you like the sequal?
Yea, the older ones at least
Not hte newer ones?
Not really
Me neither
They just made him out to be too different
I agree
And they were different from the comics by too much
Yea the original one kept to the traditional hero
Agreed!
