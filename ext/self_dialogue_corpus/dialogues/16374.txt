Whay do got think of the music of today?
I don't.
I know what you mean.
Music today does not sound good.
Yup, ever since Michael died it's changed.
Jackson was one of the best in our business.
I was so sad the day he died.
Me too.
That will go down in history.
Just like the day John Lennon died.
Who next in the music world?
Maybe some rapper.
Yeah, nobody would care.
I bet they will say it was an East Coast west coast thing.
Yeah the music has changed.
A world without music would not be good.
That is why I don't listen to the radio anymore.
I still listen to vinyl.
Once again, classic sound.
Only in the old stuff.
