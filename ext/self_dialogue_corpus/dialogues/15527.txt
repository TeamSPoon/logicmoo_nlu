Where do you find new music?
I read some blogs like Stereogum and Pigeons and Planes and I check Pitchfork.
I know Stereogum and Pitchfork, what's that other one? Pigeons and Planes?
It's a hip hop blog that also focuses on indie rock.
Oh, sounds right up my alley. I'm gonna make a note about that right now.
Yeah, you should do that for sure. How do you find music?
I really like podcasts for finding music, actually. My favorite podcasts are All Songs Considered and Sound Opinions.
I really love Sound Opinions. They do such deep dives on my favorite artists and even things like guitar solos.
Yeah, I find with both shows that the passion of the hosts for music is contagious and that I find myself having a much more vociferous appetite for music following listening to them.
So true. Podcasts give a very intimate feel.
I know recently I heard a podcast about A Tribe Called Quest and I've been on a huge binge since. The host was super passionate about them.
Tribe is from Queens just like you!
I know. They're so good.
They were one of the first hip-hop groups I could put my dad onto.
Why's that?
They're conscious rap and they sample Lou Reed and have a jazzy feel. That's all up my dad's alley.
Well, did he like it?
Like it? He loved it.
That's really heartening.
Yeah, it completely changed his attitudes towards rap.
