Who is your favorite rapper from Atlanta
Easy, I would say Ludacris.
Why Ludacris?
His lyrics and flow was awesome.
True, I think he was way ahead of his time.
I agree, he was from ATL bad has an New York flow.
I think he is very underrated.
That is not an understatement, he never got the credit he deserves.
Why didn't he get the credit he deserves?
I think it was because he was a south rapper in an era of a lot of rappers from New York.
