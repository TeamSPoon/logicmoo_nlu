I got all misty eyed this morning when I was flipping channels.
Why, what's wrong?
Nothing, really. Just thinking back to when the kids were small.
I get it. Was a kid show on?
Winnie The Pooh and the Hundred Acre Woods.
Your son loved Pooh, didn't he?
Yes, we put the movie in every night at bedtime.
He used to sing the songs didn't he?
Yes he did.
I remember all the stuffed Pooh Bears in your house.
