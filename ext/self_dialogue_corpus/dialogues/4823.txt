Did you see the Yankees's game the other night?
You mean the one where they retired Jeter's number?
Yes, that one.
I sure did, wasn't it a great night?
Absolutely, he was such a great player.
Agreed, how about the crowd?
They were on fire.
Right, they really gave him quite a round of applause.
Yes, it was thunderous and well deserved.
I agree, Jeter will go down as one of the best Yankees ever.
He'll go down as one of the greatest players ever.
That's true too but I think he will be a NY legend.
Oh yeah, he's the king of New York right now don't you think?
Yes, even in retirement he's probably the most popular Yankee right now.
I bet sales of #2 jerseys are selling off the shelves right now
Oh I'm sure they're selling a ton of his jerseys right now.
And the Yankees really wore the Astros out after the ceremony.
What was the final score, I didn't watch it all.
The Yankees won 11-6
Sounds like I missed a great game!
