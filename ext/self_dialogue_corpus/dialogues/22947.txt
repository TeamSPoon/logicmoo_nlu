Is that the one with Will Smith?
No, it's with Will Ferrel.

No, it's with real people.
What's it about?
An elf who gets sent to New York City.
That sounds like an interesting premise.
It's really funny too!

None that I know of.
How long is it?
Roughly two hours, I would guess.

Not particularly.

That's a cute name for an elf.
