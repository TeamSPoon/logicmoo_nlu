Are you a fan of Star Wars?
I never really have been
Really?? But they're classics.
I just never really got in to them.
How is that possible?
For one, I think they're a bit long and drawn out.
Have you actually seen them?
I have seen parts of each
Then how can you make an accurate judgment?
I can't. I just have no interest in seeing them.
