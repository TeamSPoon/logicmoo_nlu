What is your favorite Star Wars Movie?
I like Episode 1
Really? A lot of people think that is the worst one
I like the plot, and I like the fact that the effect look better than the older films
What do you think about the acting
Jake Lloyd was a little bit annoying as Young Anakin, but the rest of the cast was really cool
Doesn't Jar Jar Binks annoy you?
Well, I could have done without him, as he added nothing to the story
What is your favorite of the older films then?
I like Empire Strikes Back
