I finally rewatched the lion king last night.
I loved that movie, it was sad.
Yea, but it had great music.
Hakuna Matada was my favorite saying.
What did you think about the the sequels?
I liked them, but the original can't be beat.
They even had a tv show, but its nowhere near as good as the movies.
Simba was my favorite character.
I thought the animations were really good for its time.
Yea, they still hold up in 2017.
