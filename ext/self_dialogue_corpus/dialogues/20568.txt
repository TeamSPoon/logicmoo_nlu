Have you seen any Keanu Reeves movies lately?
No, I don't believe I have. What movies was he in?
He was in Speed from 1994.
What other movies was he in?
He was in Little Buddha and Constantine too.
That's really interesting!
Thank you.
Can he sing?
What do you mean?
Can he sing? Is he a good vocal talent?
I'm not sure I remember him singing at all actually. He might have sang at some point in his career.
I know some actors can sing too.
I believe some can, like Stephen Colbert. He can sing well.
I have heard him sing from time to time.
Does he sing well?
Yes, Colbert sings well. He was in Missing Persons too.
Oh wow! What character was he? I've seen that movie.
He was Chet Davis.
I don't remember him. I'll have to look for him the next time I see that movie.
I'll look out for him too.
