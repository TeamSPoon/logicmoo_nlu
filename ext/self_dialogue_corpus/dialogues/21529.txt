Have you heard about the new movie by Jon Watts?
I don't think so.  Which one??
Spider-Man: Homecoming! It comes out July 7th!
Let's go see it! I am available that day!
Sure! It's supposed to be good, Peter Parker comes home I believe.
That will be interesting!  Who is playing him this time?
Tom Holland! And Zendaya is also in the movie.
Oh that will be awesome! I'm excited to see how they play their part.
Marvel Studios is just rocking this summer!
I know, bringing back all the superheroes.
Robert Downey Jr. is going to be in it as well as Iron Man!
Oh wow really?? That's so cool.
I know! Michael Keaton as well as the Vulture.
Michael is one of my favorites.
Me too.  Have you heard of the new movie by Ryan Gosling?
New movie already? He was just in La La Land!
Crazy right.  He's going to play the lead in Blaze Runner!
That's going to be great, I always love a good sci-fi movie!
I look forward to it too!
I'm loving 2017 movies already!
