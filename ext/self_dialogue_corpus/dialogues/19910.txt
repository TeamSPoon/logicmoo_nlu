Chris Young has some great new music out, don't you agree?
I'm not sure I know who he is.
Oh, wow! He is an awesome country singer, his latest single out right now is called Sober Saturday Night.
Oh, I might have heard that. Does he have a deep voice?
Yes, his voice is on the deep side. He also did a duet with Cassadee Pope recently.
Oh yeah, I know that song it's called Think of You, right?
Yes! That's it.  Another one of his popular songs recently was I'm Comin' Over.
Yep, I heard of that one too.
I got to meet him at the last concert I went to of his, he is very nice in person.
That's cool, I'd like to go to one of his concerts sometime.
Well you're in luck, he will be in our area in July
Oh yeah? Where and When?
He is playing at Beaver Stadium on July 8th.
Oh cool, is anyone opening for him?
It's actually going to be a big concert, Blake Shelton, Big and Rich and Chris are all playing.
Cool, I like all of them it might be worth getting tickets for.
Yeah, it's called Happy Valley Jam.
I'll have to look into it, if I can afford tickets.
I'm looking forward to going if you want to tag along.
I'd like to do that, thanks.
