I am getting ready to plan a party for this weekend, would you like to come?
That sounds like fun.
I hope so. I am preparing a playlist for the DJ.
Great, what songs have you picked out so far?
I am trying to mix it up, so I have a little bit of everything.
Have you put Kelsea Ballerini's new song on the list?
I am not sure, what is it called?
Yeah Boy is the name of it.
I do not have it on the list, what genre does it fall under?
It is a country/pop song.
Great, I will add it to the list, is it a good song to dance to?
I think so, it is really upbeat.
Great, do you have any other suggestions?
Do you have any Tom Petty on the list?
No I don't I forgot about Tom Petty.
Well you have to add Tom Petty.
Your right, which songs should I add?
Free Fallin' and Mary Jane's last dance are the first 2 that come to mind.
Those are great songs, thank you for the suggestions.
You are welcome I will see you Saturday.
