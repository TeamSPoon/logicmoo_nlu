I have such a soft spot for Star Wars characters.
I do, too. Yoda is my favorite.
He has a certain cuteness to him, but he's also a cool character.
He's a grand master or something like that, right?
Yeah, he is. I thought you said he was your favorite?
I know very little about the actual character. Just things I see on the internet.
Do yourself a favor and watch The Empire Strikes Back.
Isn't that his debut film?
That's right. Maybe you can learn a thing or two.
Alright. That's definitely something I can do.
