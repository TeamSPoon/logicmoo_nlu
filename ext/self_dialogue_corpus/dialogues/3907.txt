So, how was that western thriller starring Clint Eastwood's son? Have you seen it yet?
I have actually. It wasn't as good as I expected.
That's what I've been hearing. What's the problem, though?
The story is a bit confusing and just plain under-developed,
Well, was Scott Eastwood as good as his father then?
He's a decent actor. I don't know if he's as good as Clint.
I guess I'll wait to watch in when it comes on cable.
That's a good idea.
I was looking forward to seeing a decent western.
Go re-watch Unforgiven.
