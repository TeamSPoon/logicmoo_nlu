What's your favorite aspect of Ice Hockey?
The physical nature of it.
Can you explain further?
I like how when there is a disagreement, the gloves come off and they fight.
That's like a small part of the sport itself
Yeah but it's definitely my favorite aspect
Why don't you just watch MMA if you like fighting?
Doesn't take place on ice.
If MMA was on ice you would be more willing to watch it?
Sure. It would make jiu jitsu that much harder.
What if hockey players were allowed to use jiu jitsu?
I don't even think it would be hockey at that point.
Well they still play hockey. Only difference is when they fight, they're allowed to wrestle and choke each other out.
You have my interest. Continue.
If one of the players taps out, the puck gets surrendered to the other team
It becomes less about the game at that point. Now it's more about who has better wrestlers.
Why can't it be both?
I think they would just make a rule to timeout those that wrestle.
That makes it even more interesting. Now the winner's team has the puck, but the losers have a power play.
You don't know anything about hockey.
