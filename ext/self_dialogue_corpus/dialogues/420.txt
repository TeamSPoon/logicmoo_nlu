Do you think the Broncos will be able to compete again this year?
I think they will be good, that defense is top notch.
Yeah but who is gonna start for them
I would assume Trevor Siemian again
What about paxton lynch?
I dont think he is their future QB. Too many questions.
They took him in the first round!
Better to admit a mistake before it gets bad.
I think Chad Kelly might end up the starter at the end of the year
He didnt show me enough in college.
He was pretty good
Yeah but nothing he specifically did translates to the NFL
I dont know about that, he had a good run.
Well back to Denver, if their defense sucks then they might be in trouble.
I just think they really regress this year.
Will Elway ever come down and coach?
I think he likes being an executive more than that.
Yeah me too.
They should be able to compete but that division belongs to Oakland.
Never count out Denver though
