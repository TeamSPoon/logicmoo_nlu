What do you think of pop music?
I don't really like it that much, but some songs are good.
Why don't you like it that much?
A lot of pop just feels stale to me, like it's been done before.
I think some songs are definitely like that.
I think almost all pop is like that really, it just feels so cheap and manufactured.
Sometimes. What are some of the good songs that you like?
I like some Taylor Swift stuff, she has written some good melodies that are really catchy.
Most people like her I think.
I would say so, she's very popular.
Are there any other pop songs you like?
Not that I can think of, at least not from what they regularly play on the radio.
I can understand that. The radio tends to play about the same 50 pop songs all day long.
You just get tired of hearing the same ones over and over again.
I get tired of some of them, but I don't mind hearing the good ones again and again.
Do you feel like good pop is rare?
No, I think a lot of it is good. I think it's more of us being exposed to so much good pop that we expect everything to follow the same trends.
You might be on to something there.
I think that's probably what the problem is with people getting bored of it.
I think a lot of pop artists don't have much experience writing good songs.
