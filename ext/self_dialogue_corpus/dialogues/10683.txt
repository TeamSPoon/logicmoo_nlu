Do you think that Dom's car is better than Brians in The original Fast& Furious?
Are you talking about in the end when they are racing
Yes Dom has a classic car and Brian has a Japanese car
I think on a straightaway Dom's car wins hands down
Why do you think that?
American Muscle had a ton of horsepower, Brians car would win with a lot of curves but that's the only way
Brian's car had NOS though which should have accounted for extra speed
Plus don't forget Dom has been racing his entire life so he could have gotten every bit of speed out of his car
Yeah I see your point
Best case scenario they tied
