Remember Luke's landspeeder in the first Star Wars?
Yeah, that thing was cool
He seemed like he had a lot of pride and joy in it.
Yeah, until he had to sell it to pay for passage on the Millennium Falcon
Oh right, he was upset that he couldn't get more money for it since the new model came out.
Right, but Ben told him not to worry about it.
I wonder what ever happened to that money. Do you think Han kept it
Absolutely. He was all about the money.
That's sad though. Weren't they friends in the end.
Yeah, but that doesn't mean you can't cash someone's check
