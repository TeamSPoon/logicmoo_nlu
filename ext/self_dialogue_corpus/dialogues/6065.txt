Have you seen Moana?
I have not. Have you?
No. But I want to. It looks really good.
Do you know the premise behind it?
Not exactly. I think it has to do with her wanting to be on the ocean.
I've heard the songs from it. They are really good but not as good as frozen.
I don't know.  I personally think they are better, we just haven't heard them as much.
Yeah, Frozen was wverywhere for awhile.
I think it helped that they had a Broadway star singing the main song.
Oh true. Idina Menzel was amazing!
