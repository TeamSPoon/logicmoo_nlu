What's your favorite movie of all time?
Would be a tough call, but if forced to choose likely Forrest Gump.
Great choice! However as good as it is, not sure it should've won best picture over Shawshank Redemption and Pulp Fiction
I disagree completely, don't get me wrong those are both great, but Forrest was and is better.
What sets it apart in your mind?
So many things actually. Hanks is perfect in it and it's such a charming story.
Fair points, but Pulp Fiction is Tarantino's best and Shawshank is a modern classic.
Again I do truly enjoy both, but I've been on the historical journey with Gump more times than I can remember,  the rare movie I never get tired of.
Fair enough, I feel the same way about The Exorcist.
Always felt it was a bit overrated,  I'm sorry.
Overrated? That's blasphemous my friend, Damian Karras needs to give you an exorcism.
Part of it may be that the sequels soured me a lot.
Exorcist 2 was an abomination,  just awful, but part 3 Was better than it's given credit for.
Yeah 2 was really really bad.
Was almost like they were trying to make some sort of ironic statement that only they got.
It was a confusing mess, I would agree than 3 did at least go a long ways toward getting 2 out of my mind.
Then you had the prequel eventually.
Yeah wasn't there two of them?
There were Exorcist the beginning and then another that was unreleased in theaters.
Interesting, may eventually watch them.
