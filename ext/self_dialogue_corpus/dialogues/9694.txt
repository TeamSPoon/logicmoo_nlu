I'm really happy to see more foreign hip hop available streaming nowdays.
Yeah, it's still pretty slim pickins though.
There definitely should be more but I feel it's an improvement.
And often times there's no info given on the artists.
Exactly, so you can't find out more about them and support them if you wanted to.
Yeah. I was looking for Polish rap the other week and only 3 or so decent songs came up.
That's a shame.
There has to be more of an active rap scene in places like Poland than are being represented.
I've had more success following established artists on social media and then looking up who they advertise than I do searching on my own.
I may have to try that.
