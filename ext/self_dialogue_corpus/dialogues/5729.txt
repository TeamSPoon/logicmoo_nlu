Do you like old Disney movies better than the new ones?
I like the new ones because of the graphics.
I like the old version because I don't like the live action remakes.
I didn't like Beauty and the Beast that much either.
I love Pixar movies.
Toy Story is my favorite what's yours?
Finding Nemo.
I liked Finding Dory better.
It made me cry.
All Disney movies make me cry.
