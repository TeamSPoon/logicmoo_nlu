What's your favorite Denzel movie?
The Magnificent Seven.
Good choice, I would gone with Fallen, but that's just me.
The Magnificent Seven got bad reviews, but I really liked it.
I liked it too, and it never hurts to have Chris Pratt in a movie.
I liked him less in this than in others, but still not bad.
I hated when he died.
I know him and Billy Rocks really hurt me when they passed.
I would add Jack to that too, I loved D'Onofrio in this movie.
I did too.
I thought Faraday was dead after they gave him the cigarette.
It was too, too, too great when he came up with that lit stick of dynamite.
It was a great, heroic way to go.
They all died well.
I was happy Red Harvest didn't die.
And Vasquez.
And of course Denzel made it out alive.
I was kind of shocked by that.
You can't kill your box office draw.
Of course not! You would have no chance for a sequal!
