What other Star Wars spinoffs do you think they should do?
Aside from Rogue One and the Han Solo movie.
Right.  What other ones should they do?
I would actually like to see a Yoda origin story.
That would be pretty cool.  Nobody knows where he came from.
It would obviously be heavily CGI, but the fans would dig it.
I don't think Disney has that on the roadmap though.  Think he'll come back in any of the next few movies?
As a spirit?  Doubtful, I think they've moved on from him.
He was so cool in the last prequel battling the emperor.
He does have some impressive moves.
