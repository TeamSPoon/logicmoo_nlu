Have you been following the drama in Seattle?
NO what is going on up there?
They are gonna have a running back battle for the ages.
They already had Rawls and he was really good.
They did but he kept breaking that leg.
That was brutal! I am glad Carroll is sticking with him so many would not.
Well  in free agency they got Eddie Lacy and he is really good.
Lacy came from Green Bay right?
Thats the one!  I guess he has shed some pounds and they expect good things from him.
Well that means Seattle will be pounding right down the middle then, huh?
Having two guys they can rotate thru and keep fresh all year is a coachs dream.
Isn't that the truth? That is gonna make Seattle a powerhouse.
Yea when Rawls was heathy and was in beast mode he was so quick.
He was like a firework shoothing thru everyone!
So Seattle is gonna be one to watch out for.
I can not wait to see how everyone does in the preseason.
I think it starts early August so we just have a few weeks to go.
Lets plan a watching party at my house when it gets rolling.
Sounds good to me. I will bring the drinks and you supply the football on TV.
You know it will be on the big screen.
