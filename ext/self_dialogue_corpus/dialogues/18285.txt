What do you think of Lil Wayne's music?
Frankly I'm not interested in him or his music.
Why not?
I just don't like it. It's not my preference of entertainment.
Is there something specific you don't like about his music?
There are a lot of things I don't like about his music.
Alright name a few.
First I really dislike his voice disposition.
Disposition?
Yeah his quality of character he portrays in his music.
Explain what you mean.
Well in his music he sounds like he's ignorant and possibly drugged up. That annoying laugh he has before most of his verses are an example.
I know the laugh your talking about. I can see how it could get annoying.
It doesn't bug you? Not even a little bit?
Not really I almost tuen it out because I'm so used ot it.
Aside from the voice and the strange laugh I'm not a fan of his music message.
Too ghetto and gangster for you?
Yeah exactly there just isnt anything good or positive about his music in my opinion.
I don't know maybe the majority of his music but he has some positive songs.
I can't think of a single one.
