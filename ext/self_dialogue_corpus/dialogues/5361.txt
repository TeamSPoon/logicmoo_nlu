Do you know that the movie Aladdin is based on a popular tale in Arabia?
Oh yes, the story is called Aladdin and the wonderful lamp
You know this is one of my favorite Disney movies!
It's a very good movie, it was released in November 1992
And after that they made two sequels!
And a television series, which was very successful
Really good since she won several awards at the Oscars
Yes! To the best soundtrack and to the best song.
And you know by whom it was produced and directed?
Of course, by the excellent Americans John Musker and Ron Clements and written by them together with the writers Ted Elliot and Terry Rossio.
