What is your favorite star wars character?
I still like Anakin.
Really?
Yeah, because he was so innocent but then lured to the dark side.
Yeah and plus he only went to the dark side to save Padme.
Very true.
My favorite character is Princess Leia.
I love that character too.
Carrie Fisher does a great job.
I agree.
