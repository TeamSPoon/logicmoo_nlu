I am exciting about football season this year .
Who do you think will win it all?
I have no idea , but I am in fantasy football and it makes it more interesting
oh really I find that , that takes so much time.
It does but you learn a lot about the teams and the players .
Do you support any team?
Hard to beat Tom brady  .
I know but it is so hard to repeat
I am hoping for my home team the texans
Hopefully JJ will be healthy , but you need a good quarterback
I know we really do , we have so many of the pieces of the puzzle in place
I might try fantasy football this year
I was really lousy last year , but I learned a lot .
we had one guy who paid to get list made and he finished almost last.
A lot of it is luck , because all it takes is for someone to get hurt and then all the good ones are picked.
I love football , I have since I was a little kid .
me too I was raised in Texas also and football is like a real passion.
I know I remember high school football and we have some great college teams too.
Well I hope you do well this year
Thanks have fun if you do fantasy football.
