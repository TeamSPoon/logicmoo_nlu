Did you ever think that Disney might want to make sort of a cinematic universe for their films?
Oh... God, no, I... hadn't considered that idea.
I'm sure they could retcon most of the princess movies into the same world, one way or another.
Why are you doing this? Why is this a thing you need to think about?
It just seems like it could be kind of cool. Like, Sofia and Elena are connected -- and Sofia keeps calling up the movie princesses.
Why do you know this?
Know what?
I just... okay, so... you're saying they are all connected, then?
Sort of. Through a TV show, though, and I'm not sure if it's canonical both ways or not.
Please, please, please tell me more of your fascinating theories. I won't use them in any kind of an embarrassing context, I assure you.
