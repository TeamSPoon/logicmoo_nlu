Do you think the 76ers are a playoff team next year?
Depends on the health of their players.
Who is more imporant to be on the court?
Embiid has to be.
Why do you think that?
He is generational when healthy.
He can shoot the 3.
I dont even know if they want him doing that.
He is good in the low post too.
Thats why I say hes generational.
Tall guys like that have knee problems always.
Yeah and hes had everything wrong with him including the foot.
I think its time they are all healthy.
They will be scary with Embiid and Simmonds and whomever they draft.
If I were them and they get 2 and 4 in the lottery, I would trade for the number 1.
I agree they dont need 2 players, they need the best player.
They dont need anything, they need to win.
We all do.
Its about time, their fans have been patient.
I would say so, pretty rough for that crew.
