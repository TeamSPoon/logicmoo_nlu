I like top fourty, rock, and some alternative rock.
Yes, I like a lot of different kinds too.

I don't know, but I do like Def Lepard.
They had a lot of good songs. My favorite is Bringin on the Heartbreak.
Yes, that was a great song.

I think I'd have to say Pyromania.
Yes, that was very good. I think mine would have to Hysteria.
They were all good.
I never saw them in concert. I wanted to.
I saw them years ago. Just once.
Their singer Joe Elliot has such a distinctive voice.
Yes, that's what sets them apart.
They were inducted into the Rock Walk of Fame.

In two thousand, in Hollywood.
