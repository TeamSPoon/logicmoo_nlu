I've been listening to really relaxing music while I work lately.
What sort of stuff?
Well, none of it has any lyrics. For example, there's this one band called Hyakkei.
That doesn't sound like an English name.
It's Japanese.
Got it. So what about them?
Well, all of their stuff is really slow, and the songs are just named after places.
What sorts of places?
Like "Library By the Sea" or "City Lights."
Oh, so it's very visual.
Yeah. It really gives you the feeling of being in a specific, relaxing place.
That's really nice. I imagine that sort of thing is tough to compose.
It must be! I usually only get that feeling when I've been in a certain place, listening to a specific song.
Give me an example.
I was on an airplane the first time I heard Norwegian Wood, and now whenever I hear it I remember airplanes.
That's really funny. I don't think I have any songs that are that way.
What kind of music do you like to listen to when you relax?
Usually something classical. I really like Yo-Yo Ma.
Yeah, his cello performances are great.
We should go to a concert sometime!
