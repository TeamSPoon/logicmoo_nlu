What do you think of this new line that Luke, in the next Star Wars, is over the whole Jedi thing.
I think it means he means to bring balance.
But, is that not something to show he is going to become a bad guy?
No, the whole premise is a balance. Dark and light, Jedi, Sith, he wants it to be equal.
Would that be equal, in the movie, killing off Jedi.
Well, according to Darth Plague, if one is gone maybe they both will be, that goes into a real grey area.
There is no grey area with jedi, is there?
There is not supposed to be, but look at the way they loved post Anakin.
The whole order went into hiding, you would think that would be grey.
It was, hence them all dying awful deaths in the movies, well most.
