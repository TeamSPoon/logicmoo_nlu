Did you see the film, The Babadook?
yes, i liked it, did you?
I liked parts of it. I thought the mother role was very well acted.
Agreed.Essie davis was the actress I think, she really transformed her looks and being into the role.
She was super creepy and believable. What I did not care for was maybe the end, just feel short for me.
I do think they created all this tension and fear and then maybe did not pan out the way you expect.
It left me wanting more or thinking that's it?
I think it was still well done and scary.
I do think it was scary and well done but not on my favorites list.
Fair enough. Not every film can be placed among the very top. Still think it is a good movie.
