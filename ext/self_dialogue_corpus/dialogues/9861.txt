Do you listen to any rap music?
I listen to some. I've been listening to a lot of Macklemore lately.
What is your favorite song?
Thrift shop is a classic.
I like that one but my favorite is Same Love.
One of the reasons I like his music is because he conveys a message for equality through it.
So true. He has a lot of respect for others.
I also really like Drake.
His new alblum is so good!
Agreed each song is so unique.
