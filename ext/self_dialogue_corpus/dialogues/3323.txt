Dont Breathe is such a good film.
I think it was pretty good to be honest.
It was a simple horror film without major effects.
Yeah and sometimes that is the best, you dont need CGI
Well it was before the days of that.
But you could still have the visuals.
The thieves that broke into the house in the beginning of the film.
I think that set the tone for the entire movie.
Yeah and it was acted in a way that didnt feel fake.
Yeah this was a good film when you think about it
