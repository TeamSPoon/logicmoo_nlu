The Vikings will be giving away free tickets to the first ones to arrive to the stadium next week
Really? You don't have to be in any contests?
Nope. Free tickets to the first to show up
I have to work all next week, and really I'm not a Vikings fan
That's a shame - you should try to get  the day off
It's not worth all that
They may be a better team this year !
Why is that?
Better draft choices maybe.
Name a few of them
Dalvin Cook is really a good runningback
Yeah good choice
Pat Elflein
Yeah he's very large and 6'3" 103 lbs wonderful for their defense
Ben Gedeon was their 14th pick
Yep. Another tall, stocky one great linebacker
Rodney Adams was their 27th pick
Good wide receiver.
In all they had a pretty good draft.
Hey I may go stand in line waiting for free tickets after all !
