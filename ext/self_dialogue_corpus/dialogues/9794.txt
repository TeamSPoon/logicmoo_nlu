So many of my friends went to Ultra Music Festival this year in Miami. It looks great but it didn't play the type of music I like.
What type of music do you like?
I like rap / hip-hop music. I wish I could go to a big music festival that was mainly rap artists.
Actually there are a few music festivals with mainly rap.
I have only heard of parties, but I'm referring to huge outdoor festivals with thousands of people.
I know. You should check out Summer Jam in New Jersey
When is it?
It happens ever summer. One year I went and it had an amazing line-up including Kendrick Lamar, Big Sean, Joey Badass, 50 Cent, Remy Ma and more
Wow that sounds like a great line-up full of great rappers
Another one is Urban Beach Week in Miami, but I've never attended.
