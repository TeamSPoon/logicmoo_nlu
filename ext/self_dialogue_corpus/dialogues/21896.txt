Have you seen the latest Tim Burton film?
The one about the kids in the magic home?
Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children.
Yes, that one I have seen it.
Did you like the movie?
I did. It was not like some of his other films.
I loved the way he portrayed Batman.
My favorite was  Batman Returns.
I loved Danny Divito as the Penguin.
I liked the raw feel of the movies he did, the gritty darkness.
He has such a twist on horror.
Sleepy Hollow is one of his best too.
Did you think it was better than Sweeny Todd?
I think it was a different type of film.
He and Johnny Depp have done many, many films.
He had such a strange take on Alice in Wonderland.
Tim Burton actually did most of the concept art himself.
He designed the odd look of the people and scenes?
Yes, even the mad hatter, down to his hat.
I think Johnny Depp played him to perfection.
