Have you seen You're Next?
Nope. What is it?
It's a modern-day slasher flick.
What's the plot?
It's a family reunion, I think about a dying family member dying and splitting inheritance.
So what happens?
The one son brings a group of killers to come in and murder everyone, and split the money themselves.
Ooh nice. How gorey?
Well, the first death is absolutely amazing and worth the price alone. Plus he looks like someone I know.
Sounds good!
