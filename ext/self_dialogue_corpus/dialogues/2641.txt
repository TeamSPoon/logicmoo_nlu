Hi! Do you like the Seahawks?
The Seahawks? I love the Seattle Seahawks.
How do you think Wilson will do this year?
I think he will do well. He will recover from his injuries last year.
Will his diet impact his play?
Oh, I think so.
How so?
He's eating much better than last year; he has a nutritionist and a trainer now.
I saw he was eating organically.
I saw that too.
Will the offensive line be any better?
I hope so. Who did they get?
Exactly. I don't know how the line will be any better at all.
I think the Seahawks can win, it's just a question of if they want to win.
That's such a great point. They beat the Patriots last year.
Yes, in New England too.
Yes, but they couldn't beat the Falcons in Atlanta after much more rest, for example.
The Falcons weren't as good as the Patriots too.
That is one hundred percent correct.
I'm looking forward to next season.
