Oh my goodness I can't believe it.
What are you so excited about?
I'm going to concert this weekend!
Who is playing?
You'll never guess. Its queen!
Queen is still alive?
Partially. They have a special guest with them.
I think queen is special enough.
Well I mean, to replace freddie mercury.
Nobody can replace freddie.
Well to sing his part at least. In bohemian rhapsody that is.
Ok I'll bite. Who is it?
Adam lambert.
The american idol guy?
What that how he got famous? Whatever, its going to be amazing.
I don't doubt it. Queen is a big deal!
Yeah, I've been a huge fan all my life.
You're going to have so much fun.
I know, its totally sold out, I bought these tickets a year ago!
My goodness, good luck!
