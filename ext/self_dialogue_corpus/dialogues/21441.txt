Hey, have you seen this movie City of God?
No, what is it about ?
Its about these kids growing up in Rio de Janerio who start growing up to be violent gang members. It shows how they grow up and follows their life stories. .
Hmm, soumds interesting ... Is it really violent though ?
Yeah, *laughs* it's super violent but such a great movie. One of my all time favorites.
Oh, well I'm not sure that I want to watch it tonight ... I think I want to watch something lighter.
Ok, thats fine. Would you watch it sometime with me?
Yeah, definitely .... Maybe just not tonight.
Ok, thats fine. What do you want to watch then?
I'm not sure ... Lets look at our options. Can you just pick something?
Well you may not like what I pick.
Thats ok, im actually fine with whatever you choose.
Even City of God? You sure ?
Yes, I usually dont choose movies like that but im sure ill like it.
It is honestly really great, I think it made some list of like best movies ever made.
Ok, lets check it out then!
Cool, I'm so excited to watch it. Its been a while since ive last seen it. My brother loves it too.
Do you know if it has any well known actors ?
I'm not sure ... I think I heard that they hired local boys to play the roles so its very realistic and true to the culture.
Oh, cool. Alright, lets watch it!
