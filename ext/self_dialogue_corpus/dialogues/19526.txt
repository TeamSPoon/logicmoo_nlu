have you ever listened to kool keith?
i don't think so, what type of music is it
he does underground/alternative rap under a bunch of different names
interesting, what are some of his other names
he goes by Dr. octagon, Dr. Dooom, Dr. ultra and a few other names
why so many different name
he does a lot of themed albums where he crafts a persona and then structures the songs around it
sounds crazy
supposedly he did actually spend time in a mental institution for mental health issues
wow, does that come through in his music?
definitely, his rhymes are very unique and can almost be cartoonish
what about the instrumentals, are they any good
well his beats are mostly done by kutmasta kurt, so I would say they tend to be pretty good
I will have to listen to some of it some time
DJ qbert shows up on a few of his tracks as well
I know that name in the DJ world
yep, his scratching skill are legendary
do you have any tracks of Kool Keith's you recommend?
mostly anything of his is worth a listen, but you should definitely listen to "earth people"
i'll check it out, thanks!
