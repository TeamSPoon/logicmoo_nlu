Did you have a favorite Disney movie growing up?
I always loved The Lion King.
I can't watch The Lion King because it makes me cry.
I cry when Mufasa gets trampled, but the rest of the movie is so good.
Scar still scares me even though I'm an adult now.
When I was little, I was scared of the elephant Boneyard.
Seeing the elephant bones still creeps me out.
The hyenas are so goofy though, I don't think that it can be too scary.
I also get scared at the end when Simba almost falls into the fire.
Yes, but at the end it always ends so happily.
