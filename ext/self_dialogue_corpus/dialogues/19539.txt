When did country music become so bad?
It's been that way for a while.
I know, but it's worse than ever.
At some point, it became rock for hillbillies.
I just hate that every song is about getting drunk and finding a truck.
And involves a back road of some point.
Yes, and a girl with a hat backwards or some drivel.
That's what happened with Florida Georgia Line hit the scene.
Man, what trash they put out.
It's not country at all.  I miss true traditional country.
You mean with jugs, harmonicas?
Steel guitars is what I was thinking.
It shows no sign of ever coming back.
Maybe we should start our own band.
Can you sing?
No.
Can you dance?
No.
Can you do anything artistic?
Okay, never mind, it was a horrible idea.
