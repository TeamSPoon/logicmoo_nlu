Who is your favorite comedic movie star?
Bill Murray, no doubt.
Which of his movies do you like?
Be easier to answer which ones don't I like.
Try. Which ones do you like.
Groundhog Day, Caddyshack is a classic. Quick Change isn't as well known as the others but is still great. He only has a small role in Tootsie, most people think of Dustin Hoffman, but Murray is really good in it Then there's Stripes, another Bill Murray classic.
Most of those are older movie. All of them actually. Anything new?
Again, he only had a small role in it but I loved his brief appearance in Zombieland
What other new movies has he done?
Most of his newer movies haven't really been comedies. St. Vincent and Lost in translation. If they're comedy, they're more subtle, more thoughtful.
