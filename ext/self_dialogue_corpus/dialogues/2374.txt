Yea, both teams are still good, but maybe they will start to take a backseat soon.
Yea, I just do not see that happening with Bill Belichek.
Yea, he is a great coach, but eventually they could wear down I guess, right?
Yea, eventually, but they just seem too good.
Yea, Brady has a cannon for an arm.
Yea, he does, but they are built on more than just that.
Yea, do you actually think anybody could take them down this year?
No, I don't and especially not in their division.
Yea, Miami may complete this year, but not enough to take them down.
I agree. They have a good enough offense to complete, but they are not at the Patriots level yet.
I agree! Thats a much different level than they are on.
Yea, well not everyone can be the Patriots.
How about the Chiefs?
Eh, they just haven't been able to get over the hump. Its kinda sad.
Yea, I agree. Its tough, but thats Andy Reid for you.
Yea, he is a great coach, but he struggles when it means the most.
He does and its unfortunate, but it seems to be the normal.
Yea, I agree. Maybe one day he will figure it out.
Yea, time is running out though, right?
Yea, sorta, but he has a couple more years of coaching in him.
