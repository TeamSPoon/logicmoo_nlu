Are you a Star Wars fan
Oh my god, yes!
Really, do you like ALL the movies?
Well, we won't talk about those two prequels...
Those were horrible.
Weren't they?  That guy the got to play the young Darth Vadar...
Can you say "overacting"
And what about Jar-Jar Binks
Perhaps the most annoying character in Star Wars history.
Even more annoying than the cloying little Ewoks and their Christmas specials!
