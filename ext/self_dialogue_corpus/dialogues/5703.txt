Was Atlantis the absolute bomb I think it was?
Yes it was a failure for the Disney empire.
Why do you think that was?
The material about what it was about was dumb.
Why do you say that?
I just dont think people care about water type films.
It was much more than that.
Yeah the plot was uninteresting for a major audience.
I think we have become dumber.
Disney needs to stick to cartoons though.
