Do you enjoy comedy movies?
Very much so, in the right circumstances.
What are some comedies that you like the most?
I think some older comedies, such as Billy Madison, Happy Gilmore, and Wayne's World are quite enjoyable.
You say Billy Madison and Happy Gilmore.  Is that because you like Adam Sandler?
Yes, I like Adam Sandler, but I mostly just like the style of comedy involved in those specific movies.
What style is it that you're referring to?
I like a style of comedy that is contemporary and raunchy.
Raunchy?  What do you mean by that?
I mean comedies that are explicit in some way or crossing the lines of what is considered politically correct.
