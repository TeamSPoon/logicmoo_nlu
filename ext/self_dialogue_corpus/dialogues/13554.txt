Would a Palpatine backstory be a good stand alone movie?
Yes it would, I'd like to see how he trained, and how he manipulated the Senate from his perspective.
He did a masterful job of destroying the Jedi from within.  He deserves more screen time.
I agree, he was the most powerful character, except maybe Yoda in the whole story.
Yeah, I wish they had more battles.  That was a clash of titan in Revenge of the Sith.
I'd also like to see more Darth Maul.
Yes, he needed more screen time.  He was one of the few high points from Episode One.
Him and the improved fight scenes.
I agree on that, even though the original movies were far better made the fight scenes took a huge leap forward in the prequels.
That and the continuity, they were more consistent in the prequels.  Just not as well written.
