have you seen any good movies lately?
Yes, actually I just watched the movie Taken.
I saw that movie at least 2 times and enjoyed it very much.
Yeah, I really liked it. It kept me on the edge of my seat.
Liam Neeson played a great part as the girls father.
He is an amazing actor. I am sure I will watch it again in the future.
The director Pierre Morel did a great job and I would be interested in other movies that he directed.
I did not know who the director was, but they really did a good job on that movie.
You definitely can't turn this movie off until it ends.
That is right, you need to know the final outcome.
