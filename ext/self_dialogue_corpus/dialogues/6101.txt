I just heard that a new Descendants thing is coming out.
Me too, I didn't really see too much of the first one, but parts of it sounded pretty good.
It just doesn't make sense to me. How are the villains still alive? Who did they have children with? Why have them at all if they're going to treat them like that?
Look at House of Mouse, that's just one giant crossover that throws all the rules out of the window. Disney just does what it wants.
I know, it's like canon continuity doesn't exist. It's kind of annoying.
Sometimes, you just have to go with it. It's just a show.
It's not just a show, it's not just even one show! How is everything supposed to make sense if they can't keep the timeline straight?
Relax, will ya? Let's just ignore it. Think of it as an alternate reality. A reality where children of heroes and villains somehow go to the same school and sing a lot.
It's still ridiculous.
Agreed.
