Do you think Rey will turn to the dark side in the next Star Wars movie?
I kind of think she might.  She has a lot of anger.
But she seems to have a lot of control over the force so far, even without training.
Maybe Luke will turn to the dark side this time?
I think maybe Luke wants to get rid of both the light and dark side.  He seems tired of it all.
I heard there is a new character called Rose that is going to be in the new movie.
I heard that too, but I am not sure what her role will be yet.
I also heard that the next movie is going to be a little darker.
I am a little anxious since the title is called The Last Jedi.
That is a very vague title, but it could mean a few things.
