Do you think The Prestige or The Illusionist is a better movie?
Why those two?
They were magician movies that came out around the same time. I'm conducting a survey.
An informal survey, then?
A very informal survey. So which?
Well, I think I've got to go with The Prestige.
Okay, why The Prestige.
I think the final trick is more surprising.
Just that?
The technology is also more interesting. It's historical, but has elements of sci-fi.
The twist at the end is really a head-scratcher.
Right, and I respect that.
I don't know, I think I like The Illusionist better.
Why?
Well, The Prestige is a brilliant movie, but it feels a little cold to me.
Like it's all about the trick?
Right. And some academic, philosophical questions. But The Illusionist is different.
How?
The Illusionist is really just about a forbidden romance overcoming the odds.
I don't know, that sounds sappy to me!
