Did you ever like Selena when she was out back in the day?
Like most people I didn't know much about her until she crossed over.
I Could Fall in Love I think was her big crossover song.
I really loved that song, a lot of people did.
I was watching the Selena movie with J-Lo not to long ago.
I don't really care for J-Lo's voice but at least she can carry a tune.
I think her looks and dance moves made up for what she lacked in voice.
That's true. I like that song she did with Ja-Rule back in the day.
Oh I think it's called I'm Real. It had a nice beat and catchy lyrics.
There was another one he did with a female, what was it?
You might be talking about Ashanti. He did a lot of songs with females singing the chorus.
I wonder what ever happened to Ja Rule.
I remember when DMX came out a lot of people were saying they sounded alike.
They did, but that's the same things they said with Mariah Carey and Whitney Houston.
And also with Kci from Jodeci and Sisqo from Dru Hill.
Oh I used to love Dru Hill. Beauty is her Name is my favorite by them.
Somebody's Sleeping in my Bed is mine. That video is crazy.
Remember when Sisqo went solo and did that Thong song?
Everyone was crazy about that song.
You have to admit it was catchy and the video was very entertaining.
