Do you think they will ever make any Alladin sequels?
I do not, not with Robin Williams being gone.
I liked the second Alladin.
The one called Prince of Thieves?
Yep, where he meets his dad.
And they have to save the world, bu stealing.
And there is an island on the back of a turtle, for some reason.
I liked the way Iago turned into a good guy in that movie.
I did too. Jafar was the real reason he was bad .
Jafar was really good at being bad.
