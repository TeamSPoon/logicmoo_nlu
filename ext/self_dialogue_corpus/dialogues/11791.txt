My favorite band is The Beatles.
Why do you like them?
I grew up listening to their music with my dad.
My dad never listened to The Beatles, but he likes Paul McCartney's solo music.
My dad listened to them all the time. He named me after the song Michelle, My Belle.
They use a lot of girls' names in their songs.
Lovely Rita, Dear Prudence, Julia, Lucy in the Sky with Diamond... the list goes on and on.
My favorite was Lady Madonna.
I like Hey Jude.
I think Jude was supposed to be John Lennon's son, though, which isn't a girls' name.
