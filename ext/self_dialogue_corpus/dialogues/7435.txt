Have you seen Disney's Sleeping Beauty?
Isn't that an old movie?
It is, but it's still fantastic.
What do you like about it?
Well, for one it's funny. There are lots of funny lines that kids wouldn't get.
I always like that. What else do you like?
The costumes are great. Despite being an old cartoon,  there's a quality to them that makes you want to touch them.
Can I get Sleeping Beauty to watch for myself?
It's available on Blu-Ray, DVD, and Digital.
I want to get it!
