At this point, we've all heard "Shape of You" a thousand times, but what do you think of the rest of Ed Sheeran's album?
Well, I love Ed Sheeran best on his slow, romantic songs, but I think "Shape of You" is a new creative direction.
He can really be quite the story teller, no?
For sure! Like "Castle on the Hill" on this album.
I love that song. It's so nostalgic. What other songs do you like from "Divide"?
"Galway Girl" is a really sweet song. It's cool he put it some Irish music elements.
Ed Sheeren is British, right? Not Irish?
Yep! He's from Yorkshire.
I read that he has 7 stadium concerts in Ireland in 2018, though!
Woah, I didn't know that! He must be very popular in Ireland, then.
I think he's popular all over the world!
How old is Ed Sheeran? I'd say at least 30 by the sound of his music.
He's actually pretty young! Only 26.
Only 26? But didn't his first album come out in 2011?
So he must have been 20 when that came out.
That's insane. I would have pegged that CD for a singer of 30 as well!
That's the album with "Kiss Me," right? I'm still obsessed with that song.
It is! I got hooked on him with "The A Team."
Another great song. He's got so much talent.
For the club and starry nights, we've got Ed Sheeran.
