Yea, they may be going down this year.
Yea, just like the Giants.
Yea, the Giants haven't made a lot of noise lately.
Well, Odell Beckham has, but its been mostly crying.
Yea, great receiver, but he needs to keep his mouth shut.
Yea, man if that guy puts it together, he's a stud.
Yea, he already is a great player, but his act is annoying.
Yea, well Eli isn't exactly getting any younger either. Their window of opportunity is closing.
Yea, and they haven't done much to improve their team.
I agree. They do have a ton of holes.
Yea, well that division may be up for grabs.
We know the redskins won't do too much.
The cowboys could repeat if they could keep their team out of prison.
Yea, they have a good young team and should stay solid this year.
Yea, the quarterback really looked like the real deal.
True, but anybody would behind that offensive line.
I agree. That might be one of the best offensive lines ever.
Yea, that and Elliot make them a real contender.
Yea, they do have some star power.
I agree! Throw Dez into the mix too.
