Have you been following Christian Hackenberg since he's gone to the NFL?
Well, there isn't much to follow. He didn't even dress for games last year.
I guess I mean all the stories about him.
A few here and there. He was such a highly rated college prospect but it's looking like he may never play an NFL game.
Well, the Jets quarterback situation is pretty terrible so maybe he will have a shot.
I don't know. I used to think it was just his footwork that was bad, but I guess he has major accuracy issues too.
Neither of which do well in the NFL.
No, not at all. Maybe he'd do better as a Texan.
Why is that?
Well, Bill O'Brien was his college coach during his freshman year and that was the best year he had.
I don't know if O'Brien wants to risk another quarterback situation like he had before.
Oh, you mean the issues they had with Brian Hoyer?
No, he was just always hurt I think. I'm talking about Brock Osweiler.
Oh that's right. One good year for the Broncos and then he turned out terrible for Houston.
He really did. It is interesting how that can happen with some of these guys.
I'll be interested to see if Dak Prescott can be as good in his second season as he was as a rookie.
I think so. He seems like the real deal.
Well, when Tony Romo recognized it and basically stepped aside, I think that was telling.
Yeah. Romo just couldn't get passed all of his injuries.
Well, with the money he was making I'm not sure just how bad I feel for him!
