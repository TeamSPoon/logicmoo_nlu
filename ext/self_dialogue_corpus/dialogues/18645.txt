Did you hear who died over Christmas?
Yeah, I was shocked George Michael passed.
Darn shame really.
Agreed.  He was a terrific singer and seemed to be a good guy.
Yeah, a sensitive bloke though and I think the industry got to him.
Yeah, such a shame.
I even remember his Wham days fondly.
Me too.  Who was his partner in that?  I cant remember his name.
Andrew Ridgley.  He became a race car driver or something.
Really?  Thats interesting.
Anyway, his solo stuff was on another level.
Yup.  Could get a bit schmaltzy sometimes though.
True, but that is not uncommon to pop.
Yeah, and mostly it was just great songwriting.
He had such soul too.  Remember that duet with Aretha?
I do.  And with Elton.  Great stuff.
He was just too damn young.  And Im not even sure how he died.
I know, I dont know what really happened.
In any case I'm listening to his stuff again quite a bit.
Me too.  Forgot how much I loved 'Jesus to a Child'.
