Hey, have you heard about the supposed rivalry between Kendrick Lamar and Big Sean ?
No. I don't actually know who Big Sean is ?
He is a rapper for Detroit. You have to know of least on of his songs ..
Which one ?
B*tch, I don't F*ck with you.
Nope, never heard of it.
Oh common... He is signed to Kanye West's label G.O.O.D.
Who else is there ?
I think also Pusha T and Travis Scott.
That sound like a big label. So what about the rivalry ?
Yeah, supposetly Kendrick Lamar and Big Sean send shots at each other throughout their songs.
Like which one ?
Kendrick Lamar's "Be Humble". You heard it right ?
Yeah, so ?
Well supposedly he uses Big Sean's ad lip and also the whole song is targeted at him.
Oh wow. That sounds intense. Which other song ?
If you ask the internet, almost every song from Kendrick Lamar's new album "Damn" haha.
I see, well that song "Humble" is certified platinum now.
Oh wow, thats one profitable diss haha.
You bet !
