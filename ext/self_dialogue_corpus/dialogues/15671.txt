Homeboy Sandman came out with another album.
Oh nice, I haven't been following him.
It may be one of his best, you should give it a listen.
I will, it still on Stones Throw?
Yea, has he done work with anyone else?
I am not sure actually.
It sounds a lot like First of a Living Breed to me.
That is my favorite of his so good.
What is your favorite song?
I have to say Mine All Mine.
His flow is ridiculous on that song.
Yea, have you seen the video for it?
It is really cool, simple but well made.
I feel that way about all his videos.
I am surprised he is not more popular.
I actually know a lot of people who do not like him.
Why not?
I think it is mainly his voice.
It is a quite monotone and boring voice.
But his lyrics and beats are so good.
