One Disney movie I really like but many don't seem to is The Lion King 2.
I know that movie. It's pretty good.
Yeah I actually prefer it more than the first one because I like the romance story between Kiara and Kovu.
It does seem to be more developed than Simba and Nala's romance.
Plus I like the actor who does Kovu's voice.
Who does Kovu's voice?
Jason Marsden. He is a pretty popular voice actor that does a lot of work for Disney shows and movies.
Oh I remember him. Didn't he do the voice for Max in A Goofy Movie?
Yeah that's him alright.
Cool. I liked that movie too a lot.
