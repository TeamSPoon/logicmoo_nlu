Hey, are you ready for some football?
Yeah, can't wait for the NFL season to start.
Who you rooting for this year?
The same team I root for every year.
Not the Giants.
Yes.
Wow, you are a diehard fan.
I'm what you call "loyal." Besides, they came close last year.
Yeah they did. Who did they lose their wild card to?
The Packers. But all in all they had a pretty good season.
Ok. I think they won 11 games and lost 5.
That is about right.
I heard they drafted Evan Engram in a first round pick.
Yes. They compare him to the good ole Jordan Reed.
They are both tight ends, right?
Correct, and you know Jordan Reed plays for the Red Skins?
Yes, he plays a good game.
Well, we will be able to see what both players bring to the field this year.
Good talent is always fun to watch.
Especially, when opposing defenses have trouble matching up against these players.
