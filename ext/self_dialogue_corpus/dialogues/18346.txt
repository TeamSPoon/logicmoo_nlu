Have you heard the latest Justin Bieber album?
Yes I have and I like it a lot I used to not be a fan of his but he's improved a lot
I feel the same I used to not like him too much but he's really good now.
I also love the despacito remix he did I could listen to it all day.
Me too! I love that remix it's always on repeat
Everytime I turn on the radio it comes on and I have no complaints.
He hasn't made a new album for a while now.
Ya he's been doing a lot of collaborations with other artists.
Maybe he's just taking a break from making his own music.
maybe but I would like to see the old Justin Bieber return.
I think his next album will be really good but we might be waiting for it for a while.
I think maybe in 2018 he'll come out with some new music.
What are some of your favorite songs from him?
I love the song love yourself.
Oh thats a great one. I personally really like all that matters.
Thats a really meaningful song.
I think he sang it about his mom I heard something like that a while ago.
oh wow thats really cute.
Ya I can't wait to see what music he makes next
Me too
