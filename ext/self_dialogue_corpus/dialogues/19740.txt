Are you excited about the concert tonight?
You know it, playa!
That's not how you typically talk. Anyway, what time should we pick you up?
We have to be at the ticket window at 6:45, so 6:15 sounds good.
Aren't you excited?
Of course! I've never seen Beethoven 9 live before.
Who are the four soloists?
They're voice professors at our school.
That must be awkward--aren't there more than one per part?
Yeah, we have two tenor and two soprano professors, but just one bass and alto.
Was there any in-fighting over who got the part?
Oh yeah, they're crazy jealous at each other. The side-eye I see every day is hysterical.
Have you been to this concert hall before?
No, how are the acoustics?
I'm not sure. They were already great, but then there was $2 million in renovations over the summer.
It better be spectacular.
Just so you know, bring your ID. There are drinks in the lobby.
I can listen to a live concert completely plastered?
Don't get drunk.
I won't, but I can't wait to hear the music swirling around while tipsy.
