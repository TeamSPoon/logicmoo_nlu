You must be under a rock sir.
Yes, I believe I am.
I can give you that very record if you want.
Yes, I would like that.
I have it on eight-track.
Eight-track? I didn't think they still made those.
They don't, I had to convert it over.
From what to eight track?
From vinyl to eight track.
Why would you do that?
I can play it it my car now.
What about cassettes? Can't you play those in your car too?
