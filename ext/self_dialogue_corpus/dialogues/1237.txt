I am so looking forward to seeing the Vikings play this year.
My family are crazed Vikings fans from way back.
I didn't know you liked football.
I don't - I said my family were crazed fans.
Ah.
I remember back in the day when pro football players looked like little kids.
What do you mean?
Take a look back at photos from the Fran Tarkenton days.
What am I looking for?
You'll see what a pro athlete looks like when they are NOT using steroids.
What?
Take out your phone and Google Fran Tarkenton/Vikings/1970s and see what I mean.
Wow, he looks like a 15 year old!
Yeah, and a 15 year old without huge muscles and a neck that's three feet thick.
I see what you mean.
Back then Bud Grant worked them hard and seemed to like making them uncomfortable.
How so?
He didn't allow heaters for the outside games. Some got frostbite.
Man, today's athletes are a bunch of coddled babies.
I agree.
