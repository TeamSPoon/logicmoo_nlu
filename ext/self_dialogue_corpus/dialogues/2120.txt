Hello dear friend. Will you be partaking in the NFL football watching.
Oh yes dear sweet friend nothing would make me happier.
Will you feast during the football game?
Yes I will feast on succulent sweetbreads and fresh fruit as I watch NFL.
Succulent feast! Hurrah for football!
I will rejoice at the kick and the touchdown!
I will watch the muscular men run about as they chase dreams of excellence.
What team do you like best?
I like the Falcon and also the Oilers.
They are all warrior of grill Iron,  the players.
I agree with you dear sweet friend.
I hope the team Falcon does touchdown often and with great ferocity.
Yeas and the Bernie Kozar and the Refrigerator Perry play with a spirit of sportsmanship.
I will toast to Refrigerator Perry, master of NFL  footballs and the Grill Iron!
A toast of schlivovitz for him and his football game comrade.
My mind is filled with excitement about the game.
And mine as well.
The football is a game of excellence.
And the NFL is the excellence of leagues!
Tomorrow we watch football game and feast.
