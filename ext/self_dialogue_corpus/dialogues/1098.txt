Hey who is your favorite NFL team?
I like the Cowboys.
I like the Steelers.
Haha.  They were big rivals in the 70s.
Yeah.  They have meant in 3 Super Bowls.
Yeah.  Steelers won two and the Cowboys won it in the late 90s.
It seems your defense is getting in trouble off the field lately with 4 arrests.
Yeah, we keep beating ourselves.
Do you think Romo will come back?
No, I think he is done now that he is in the CBS booth.
Yeah I think so too.  If Zak gets hurt, then they are screwed.
Yeah, same with Rothlesburger.
Yeah hopefully he can stay healthy this year.
Bell always seems to get beat up too.
Our defense does too.  Harrison had to come out of retirement to play.
He could out bench the rest of the team when he retired!
He is now 39 years old and still playing!
That is more impressive than Brady being 40 and still playing!
It is, because he gets hit on every play as a defensive lineman.
Yeah, and he is effective too, because I always see him rushing the passer from the outside.
