How great was the Jay Z Kanye West group album.
I might be in the minority but I did not like it.
Why not?
I thought it was a bit pretentious.
In what manner?
They just both have huge egos.
Thats what made the album so good
The lyrics were a little awful just bragging about how rich they are.
Thats what rap is about though, you gotta go hard.
I can go hard but some of it was aimless.
