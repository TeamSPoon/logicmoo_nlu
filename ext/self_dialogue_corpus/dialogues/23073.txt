You know what movie was funny?
An adult movie or kids movie?
A kids movie. It also has a book to go with it.
Well, which movie do you mean?
Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs.
You're right that was so cute! I loved it.
My kids were obsessed with it for awhile.
I remember we rented it from the library.
We bought it since my kids watched it so much.
It's so funny to see food fall from the sky.
Kind of makes you wonder doesn't it, what it would be like?
It really does, I know I would want to order certain foods too.
In the book I remember that it started to get out of hand.
Yes, a pancake landed on the school. The town started to shut down.
Then they made sailboats out of stale bread to leave the city.
In the movie I loved it when they made the "ice cream snow."
Right, that looked so fun!
I bet those burgers from the sky tasted good.
Maybe so. I couldn't imagine having to eat sardines.
Yes that sounds disgusting.
