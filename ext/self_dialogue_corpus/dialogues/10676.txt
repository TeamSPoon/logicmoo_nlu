The whole Fast & Furious series of movies changed the way I looked at cars forever.
I know, I see a car similar to any from the movies and it takes me back to some scene.
They really shouldn't have made any without Vin Deisel.
I don't know that he was too interested at the time.
No, I suppose not, but I am glad he got over that.
Have you ever watched many in a row?
I have, and I always notice that Dom's arms just grow significantly.
Do you think it was steroids?
I don't nkow, probably, or maybe it's me, jealous, that I will never have his arms.
Just keep working out, and eat your vegetables.
