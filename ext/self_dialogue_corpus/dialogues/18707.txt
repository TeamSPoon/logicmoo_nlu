I hear you listen to Jazz.
I do.
Who's your favorite Jazz musician?
Oh, that's easy. Louis Armstrong.
Of course. What's your favorite Louis Armstrong song?
"What a wonderful world"
That's been remade, hasn't it? Someone else did it too.
I'm sure they have. He may not even be the first person to do it. But I favor his version.
What other Louis Armstrong songs do you like?
"Do  you know what it means to miss New Orleans."
When I first heard that song I thought he was talking about a girl.
A beauty paegent winner, right? Miss New Orleans.
Exactly.
Yeah, I started listening to Louis when I was a teenager and I thought the same thing for a long time.
What other Jazz artists do you like?
Well, you can be a Jazz fan without being a fan of Louis Armstrong and Miles Davis.
Of course. You got a particular one of his songs, you like?
No, I never listen to just one of his songs. I play the entire album.
So, what's your favorite album?
Do you really even need to ask? Kind of Blue, of course.
