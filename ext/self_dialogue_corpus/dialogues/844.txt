Yea, I just truly think that Tom Brady is tough to beat.
Yea, he always is, but eventually age catches up.
Yea, I agree, but did he show any signs of getting old?
No, not really he was still really good.
Exactly! Last year was as goof of a year for him as any.
It was! I just always think eventually his arm will tire.
Yea, I agree, but they just know how to win.
Yea, that is true. One hit on them and they could be in trouble though.
Yea, they have to keep him healthy.
Yea, if not the Patriots, maybe the falcons can win this year.
Yea, it was a shame that they couldn't hang on last year.
Yea, they had it in their hands and just blew it.
Yea, that or the Patriots just took over.
Yea, a little of both.
Its tough to beat teams that have won before when it gets to crunch time.
Yea, there is something to be said about knowing how to win.
Yea, I agree. Belichek and Brady both seem to.
Yea, they just have what it takes.
Yea, I do not know if any team in the AFC can overtake that  tandem.
Maybe Pittsburgh, but I'm not sure if they can either.
