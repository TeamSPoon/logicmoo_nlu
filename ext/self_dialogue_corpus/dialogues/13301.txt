Star Wars movies are much better now that Disney has taken over.
What do you think is better?
The three made before were just bad.
Can you be more specific.
Sure: the actors were bad, the characters were awful, the plotlines were bad.
I see.  What is better about Disney's versions?
They went  back to the original characters and stories.
I suppose I can see your point. What else?
They are more true to the original three movies, as far as storylines.
I will have to go see the newer ones, as I haven't yet.
