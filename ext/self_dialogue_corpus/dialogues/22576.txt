what movie makes you cry?
So many, I am so easily to tears.
But if you had to choose one.
I know it may sound silly but dumbo gets to me.
It is kind of a sad tale at first.
Exactly that seen with his mom in the jail when they play, baby mine, has me in tears.
It is very touching. I loved seeing all the babies with their animal moms during that part.
It really is a great film.
I agree.
what film brings you to tears?
Like you many, but one of the ultimate tearjerkers for me is, My Girl.
Oh my , yes. so sad.
It brings me to tears just thinking about it.
That little girl was a great little actress.
Anna Chlumsky was her name. she was great as vada.
I think she is on veep and still acting.
I believe you are right.
Macaulay Culkin was also great in this film.
I used to love him so much. Home alone was a great film.
I was sad things did not turn out better for him.
