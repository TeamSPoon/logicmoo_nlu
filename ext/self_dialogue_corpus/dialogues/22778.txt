Are you in the mood to do something fun?
I would actually like to watch a few movies today.
That sounds like my kind of fun!
Great, what type of movies do you like?
I like romantic comedies and action movies the most.
That is kind of a rare combination. Most people like one or the other.
I know! That is what everyone always tells me.
Who is your favorite actor or actress?
I would have to say Demi Moore! I have always loved her movies.
Yes, she has put out some really good films.
Have you ever seen G.I Jane?
I watched that many years ago. It was a pretty good movie without a doubt.
I agree! That is one of my three favorite movies of hers.
What are the other two?
One of them is The Butcher's Wife. That one is a great romantic comedy.
Does that one also star Jeff Daniels as well?
Yes! He is awesome in his role as her romantic counter part.
That is another one that I have not seen in years!
My third favorite movie from her is About Last Night.
That movie came out when I was in high school!
