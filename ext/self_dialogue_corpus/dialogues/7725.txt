My husband and I finished all of the Harry Potter movies finally. Out of curiosity, who was your favorite character?
I have always been a traditional Harry fan myself. He is just such a dynamic character.
True, he is. I guess he is probably a lot of people's favorite.
Well who is your favorite?
You know, I would have to say my favorite was Draco Malfoy.
What? I don't know anyone else who would say Draco Malfoy is their favorite.
Personally, I find him relateable. I do not think he is a bad person, just someone who wants to please his family.
I guess I never thought of Draco like that. He is just a kid who is stuck between what is right and what his family wants.
However, as far as funny characters-Hermione!
She is a hoot.
