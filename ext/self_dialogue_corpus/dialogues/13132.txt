I hated the first Star Wars.
Wasn't that like episode 4?
Dont confuse me. The first one with Luke and Han in it.
Yeah, why not, it's a classc.
Darth Vader was cool and all but a little dorky looking. I wanted a real science fiction film.
What? Dude are you nuts?
I'm not nuts. Luke was a fork. The acting was stupid and the story moreso.
You're just bitter dude.
I'm not bitter, I have taste.
If you dont like Star Wars what do you like?
