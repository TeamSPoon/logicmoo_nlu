Do you listen to the Beatles often?
Not really.
You know their music though right?
Yeah, I think everyone knows a few of their songs.
What's your favorite song by them?
I would have to say Hey Jude.
Why would you say that?
Probably because it's the first one I thought of.
It is pretty well known.
Yeah, it really is.
