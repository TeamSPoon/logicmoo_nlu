Are you planning on getting Mumford & Son's new album?
Wow, i had no idea they had a new album.
Where have you been?
Working, I guess. I don't really follow them like that.
That's true, they can be a little more active on social media.
I know! i hate when artist don't release good things to their fans.
We should at least appreciate the greatness of Babel.
That was a genius album.
What are your favorite tunes?
Hands down Babel and Hopeless Wanderer.
Those tracks are sick. I like that they didnt become mainstream.
I know, after the success of their first album I thought they would try more radio play.
That's how you know they are authentic and proud of their sounds.
That is one of my favorite qualities from them.
Anyways, I am so excited for this album.
Agreed.
Want to have alistening party when the album drops?
That would be great!
Before that we can listen to Babel all day long.
That sounds amazing, can't wait!
