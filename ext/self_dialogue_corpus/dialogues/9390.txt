Do you ever listen to Earl Sweatshirt's music?
Oh yeah. Earl is a genius.
His wordplay is crazy.
I agree, his stuff is really emotional too.
It definitely has a sense of honesty to it.
What's your favorite song by him?
I personally always liked "Hive".
That's a good one.
Although his verses on "Rusty" are ridiculously good.
That was actually the first song I ever heard by him.
