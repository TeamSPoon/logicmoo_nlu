Do you think James Franco wants to do only comedies?
No he has won awards for other films.
Yeah but his most famous films are the comedies
Maybe to you but he is pretty diverse.
I just think he harkens back to the comedies to satisfy his buddies.
I dont ascribe to that, he just wants something lighthearted.
One of his best friends is Seth Rogen.
Yeah he incorporates him into alot of stuff they do.
They go back a while.
They did a bunch of films together.
Which one do you think was the best?
I would say Pineapple Express.
I loved This is the End.
Yeah that was like the ensemble of that pack of people.
It was, and it flowed quickly enough where you laugh the entire time.
Some of the jokes were not funny, I thought Craig Robinson stole the show.
He is a funny guy, I wonder why he doesnt get more roles.
He does, theyre just boring roles sometimes.
Makes you wonder about the race in Hollywood debate.
Not for me, just think hes type casted and he hasnt learned that yet.
