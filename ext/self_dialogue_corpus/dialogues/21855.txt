Whats the worst movie you have ever seen?
I would have to say The Last Airbender
Yea, that movie was awful
It had so much potential
Yea, the animated tv show was amazing
M. Night Shyamalan has not been doing well with his movies for awhile.
What do you think went wrong?
I just think the movie lacked everything
Yupp, the acting was bad, nothing about it was engaging.
The sixth sense was a huge hit
That ending was great.
I love Bruce Willis movies
He is great in Die Hard
Another great franchise, yupp.
What do you think they will do when he gets too old to do it?
Probably just hire someone else who is bald
Yea, they can probably milk the franchise for awhile after
As long as it's good, I will watch
Yea, that's my one prerequiste. Being good
What else do you need?
