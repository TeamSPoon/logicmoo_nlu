I really like some classical music.
I do too. I think it is because I took a music appreciation type course in college.
I did too. But I played violin and my grandmother was a concert violinist.
Oh, so you were brought up on it then.
Yes. I have a favorite composer though.
Which one?
Johanne Sebastian Bach.
Ok. I have heard of him.
He was Baroque style. I love his music.
What is your favorite piece of his music?
His orchestral suite number 1.
Ok obviously don't know it.
I learned to play it at a music camp. It really brings back great memories when I hear it.
I have music that does that. You should play it for me once.
It really is wonderful. It has a few different pieces of music in it.
Oh, it is not like one song?
No it is broken up into different pieces.
What do you mean.
Well you have the overture, then the courrante, the gavotte,..
Ok. I have no idea what you are talking about. But it sounds great.
