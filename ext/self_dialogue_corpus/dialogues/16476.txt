What sorta music do you want to play for the cook out
I am not sure actually
Have not thought about it yet?
Nah have not taken the time to give it any thought to be honest
Well you should give it some thought the cook out will be soon
Yeah Yeah  i know its soon
So lets talk about it then
Well sure i guess we can
Anyone from the older side of the family coming
Nah not at all
So that means we can play anything then
Do you got something in mind
I was thinking something rocking you know?
What do you mean rocking?
Something that gets the juices flowing if you know what i mean
I think i know
Well give me a suggestion
Well how about something like Black Flag
That sounds like that would be an awesome suggestion to start with
Lets go from their then.
