I wonder why Disney keeps putting out all these rmakes.
I don't know but it's annoying.
I agree. They need to come up with new ideas.
That Beauty and the Best one wasn't too bad but all that auto tuning in the music was bad.
I like Emma Watson OK but you're right.
I cringed when I heard it.
Me too. She started singing and I was like, ug.
Did you like the Cinderella one?
No. I hated it. I didn't like that Mirror, Mirror either.
That was the Snow White remake, right?
Yes.
They did the Jungle Book too.
I haven't even seen that.
It's not that good.
I figured.
The thing is these are classics and they just keep rehashing them.
Right. I'd like to see something new.
They could even do different classic books.
Right. I wonder why they don't.
Who knows?
