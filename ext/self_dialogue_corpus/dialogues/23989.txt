I watched the movie This is the End for the first time last night. I really enjoyed it.
That movie is so funny. I love that there are so many stars in it.
Me too! There's so many famous faces: Seth Rogan, James Franco, Jonah Hill, Danny McBride and so many others!
I was doing some reading on the film, there are actually a lot of real-life references in the movie.
What do you mean?
Well for example, the jokes they make about each other in the film, a lot of them are based on truth.
How so? Give me an example.
You know how Jay Baruchel dislikes Hollywood and doesn't want to hang out at James Franco's house in the movie? That's actually true.
No kidding. I wouldn't have guessed that. Although it makes sense since they all play themselves in the movie.
Yeah, there's lots of things like that in the film. I read that a lot of feelings got hurt during the making of the movie.
That's interesting. That makes me want to watch the movie again to catch the inside jokes.
I did the same thing after I read about that.
What's your favorite scene in the movie?
There's so many of them. But I like all the scenes where Danny McBride is being such a jerk.
Yeah the scene when James Franco wakes up and Danny is eating all the food they have left to survive.
That was funny. Also the scene where he pours their last jug of water over his head.
And when he puts on the tuxedo James Franco wore when he hosted the Oscars!
I also like the part when they're trying to Exorcise Jonah Hill, the things he says while he's tied to the bed.
And then he just goes up in flames.
Hilarious film. Definitely worth watching multiple times.
