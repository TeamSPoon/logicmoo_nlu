I heard a song on the radio the other day but can't figure out who it was by.
What were the lyrics?
It was a pop funk type of song. The lyrics were something like don't stop till you get enough.
Sounds like it was Michael Jackson.
You think? This does not sound like any of the Michael Jackson I know.
Yeah his early work had a much different feel than the work he did towards the end of his career.
When I think Michael Jackson I think thriller not the song I heard.
Yeah I prefer his earlier work. It had so much soul and character.
So what album should I get that has some of his early music?
The thriller album has some great songs on it that have a much different feel than the title track of the album.
What other songs have that early Michael Jackson feel?
Rock With You is my personal favorite.
That doesn't sound very good. Is it a rock song?
Hardly. It has kind of a disco funk sound it's a great song.
Disco funk. That sounds interesting. Nothing like his later works.
Yeah, he worked with a lot of good producers. They put out great songs that went with the current trends of music.
Did he ever make any songs in his later career that had a similar feel?
One that comes to mind was Butterflies.
That title sounds kind of corny.
Yeah I know, but the song is really great.
