I'm researching Ken Smith and his stats.
He has good ones.
He does.
What did you find?
He's scored the most touchdowns on his team.
That's impressive.
He also is the smallest player on his team.
Really? How much does he weigh?
He is 5'9" and weighs 155.
Yeah, he's pretty small.
He is lean muscle.
Absolutely.
Does that affect his game?
Well, I know he's faster because he's lean.
That makes sense.
He's a running back right?
Yes, he is.
Oh ok.
He is also only 26 years old.
He's a youngin!
