What was your favorite System of a Down song?
Toxicity was their best I think
The album or the song
The song was so good
I dont know if that was that good
The change in tempo in much of the song was really well developed
But the themes of the song were trite.
I wouldnt say that it was a political track.
I still love Chop Suey.
That was the first song they released, right?
Yeah its what garnered them all the attention.
Yeah I think that was too juvenile of a song.
No, it connected with people.
Do they still make music?
I feel like they dont.
They were pretty Hollywood for a political band.
I wouldnt say they were that
Well they werent Rage Against the Machine but they still had lyrics that supported their beliefs.
Their music was more about their home country.
I thought they weer all from LA to be honest.
