Do you feel that the NFL is still the best pro sport out there?
There is no doubt about it in my opinion.
How long have you been watching the NFL?
I have probably been watching for nearly fifty years.
That is about how long my dad has been watching as well.
I have had the opportunity to watch some great football in my day, that is for certain.
My dad and me always argue about the best NFL defense of all time.
You guys sound like me and my two sons now. Who do you think had the best defense ever?
I feel that the 2002 Tampa Bay Buccaneers had the best defense of all time.
They were really good, but I have to disagree with you on that one.
Who do you think had the best defense of all time?
That would be the 1976 Pittsburgh Steelers. Hands down!
Was that the Steel Curtain defense?
It sure was! I have still never seen a defense like that in my life.
That is who my dad says was the best defense ever!
He must be a smart man! At one point that season, they went twenty two straight quarters without giving up a touchdown.
That is actually a pretty amazing stat. That Buccaneers team was loaded with talent though.
Trust me, they would not even touch that 76' Steeler defense!.It was amazing!
Do you think Tom Brady could put up some points against them?
Not even if he had Jerry Rice and Randy Moss to throw to!
