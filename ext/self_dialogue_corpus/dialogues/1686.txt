Hello.
Hi there.
Do you like football?
Yeah sure do.
NFL or college?
Both really, but probably the NFL a bit more.
Oh really, why is that?
The professionals are better and the games are more exciting.
I see what you mean.
What about you, watch a lot of nfl?
I watch a few games here and there.
Do you have a team you support?
I like the Ravens.
Oh okay, you from that area.
That is where I grew up, but I don't live there any more.
I see.
Do you have a team that you go for?
I like the Jets a lot.
Man the jets are bad.
Yep.
