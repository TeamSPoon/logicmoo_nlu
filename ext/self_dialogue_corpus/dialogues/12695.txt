Was Darth Vader the ultimate villain?
I think James Earl Jones played him perfectly.
It was tough because you cannot see the emotion on his face.
Yes I agree with you on that one.
So do you think Darth Maul was better?
No he wasnt even around long enough to say that.
I think they were in the same amount of movies.
Not being able to see Vader's face was a different persona.
Yeah thats true.
Kylo Ren could be the next ultimate villain
