Have you ever seen any Mel Brooks films?
The director with the funny movies?
Yes, I watched a film of his recently.
What film?
It was called Spaceballs.
That is so funny! Love that one.
It is a spoof of Star Wars.
I loved John Candy in that one.
He is a half dog, so funny when he gets the dog treats.
Mel Brooks did a lot of  tongue and cheek comedy.
Did you know he did more serious ones too?
Did he?
Yes, he directed The Fly.
The scary movie?
Yep. It did really well too.
I never knew that.
He did cartoons too, like Hotel Translvania.
The kids movies?
Yep. He did a few kids movies, Little Rascals too.
I remember him having a cameo in that one, as a Rabbi.
