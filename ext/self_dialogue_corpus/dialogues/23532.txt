What do you think of movies that were based on books?
It depends if they truly follow the book.
The Twilight movies were based on books.
Yes I thought the books were better though.
They were still a good series of movies though.
Oh I agree, Twilight was a huge franchise.
A lot of Stephen King books were made into movies as well.
Yes, I have seen almost every movie that was based on his book.
I agree though, his books are way better than the movies.
I hear there is a remake of IT.
Nothing can beat that book, even the original IT did not do so well following the book.
It was still a great movie though. I bet the remake will be good.
Stephen King said they did a fantastic job on the remake.
It comes out this fall I believe, are you going to go see the movie?
Of course, I am excited to see how well the movie came out.
It may be too scary for me, I do not know if I can watch it or not.
That is what makes it so good, a movie that can scare you is a great movie.
Yeah, I know it is not real, but still can give me nightmares.
It is probably best you do not watch the remake of IT then.
I may or may not go see it.
