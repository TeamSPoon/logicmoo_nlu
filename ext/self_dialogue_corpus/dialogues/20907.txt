What movie did you guys go see last night?
Unfortunately we went to see The Mummy.
Why unfortunately? It looked good.
It was terrible.  I expected it to be as good as the Brendon Fraiser movies.
It has Tom Cruise man, he's great in everything.
I don't know what it was about the movie, it was just boring.
The action wasn't good?
There was some good Tom Cruise-esque action, but besides that it was just dull.
How so?
What do you mean?  The characters were just dull and weren't very believable.
I think you're just letting your Brendon Fraiser fandom skew your perception.
Maybe, he is my favorite actor.
I haven't watched many of his movies, what do you recommend?
All of them.  But seriously, Encino man and blast from the past are great.
I haven't seen them yet, any more?
I'd watch those two and Dudley Do Right and let me know what you think.
Alright, bring your copies tomorrow so I can watch them.
Alright, don't lose them though.
I won't man, I never do.
Alright, I'll see you tomorrow.
