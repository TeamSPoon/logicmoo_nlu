Do you like scary movies or thrillers more?
Honestly? Thrillers, because I'm a huge baby about scary stuff. Why?
Oh, I'm just looking for recommendations for good thrillers from, like, the past 10-20 years.
Did you ever see any of the Jason Bourne movies?
Yeah, I didn't like them too much though. They all feel like the same movie: generic dude being chased by spies...
I guess so. I still think they're fun, though. What about Fast and Furious?
Totally, love 'em!
No offense, but that seems a little ironic. Those movies are the definition of generic, aren't they?
Yeah, but they're so-bad-they're-good status, you know? And still exciting the way thrillers should be.
I guess that's fair.
