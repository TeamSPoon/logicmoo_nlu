Are you as excited as me for the upcoming NFL season?
Yes! I need some football in my life in the worst way!
Let's talk about who the best defensive team is going to be this season.
Sounds like fun, who do you have?
I think this year the Seattle Seahawks will emerge as the leauge's best defense.
That is a pretty good pick in my opinion. Pete Carroll has focused on that side of the ball ever since he has been there.
Yea and he has a good defensive coordinator to run things in Kris Richard.
They sure do have a lot of talent on defense as well, and that always helps!
They were able to keep Richard Sherman this year and that was huge!
I kept hearing rumors that they were looking to trade him.
That is what was in the news, but who knows how true that stuff really was.
Do you think Sherman is the most important player that they have on defense?
I am not sure about that, Earl Thomas is pretty important himself.
He sure is! After he went down with that broken leg last year their defense was never the same.
No it was not. Do you think the Seahawks will be the best D as well?
Maybe, although I am pretty high on the Houston Texans' defense for this upcoming season myself.
I forgot about them! Yea they should be pretty good on that side of the ball this season.
I love Mike Vrabel as the defensive coordinator, plus they have great talent as well.
J.J Watt might be the best defensive player in the NFL.
Yea and do not forget about Jadeveon Clowney either, he is a beast in his own right.
