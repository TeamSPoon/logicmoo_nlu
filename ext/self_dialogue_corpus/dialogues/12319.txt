What did you think of The Phantom Menace?
As a movie?  Pretty average, but the weak point of the franchise.
I know what you mean too much politics.
At least we got Darth Maul though.
Yeah, plus a young Obi Wan was pretty cool
And Liam Neison brought depth to the Jedi Order.
The age difference between Anikan and Padme was a little creepy though.
Yeah it was, and the part about him making C3PO.
I know, it didn't fit with the original movies very well.
No, not really.  But again, at least we got Darth Maul.
