Way better.
What about Jackie Brown?
Yup. That one, too.
That's impossible.
Why's that?
Jackie Brown is criminally underrated.
That doesn't mean it's better, though.
Well, that's subjective. But, in all seriousness, you can't beat the characters in Jackie Brown.
Well, that's subjective, too.
You're right, but I think we're just going to have to agree it disagree on this one. I liked it, but I haven't seen one as good as Jackie Brown, yet. Django was up there, though.
Oh yeah. Django was great.
Django was great, but I thought it went downhill a little when they get to Candyland.
No way! Candyland was the best part. That's where he goes crazy on everybody.
Yeah, that part was good, but it takes so long to get there after they first arrive. Also, I can't stand Calvin Candie.
Well, you're not supposed to.
I know, and that's a testament to Leonardo DiCaprio. But, I want to like a villain at least a little bit. Look at Ordell in Jackie Brown.
Oh, here we go.
I'm sorry, but it's my favorite. I don't know if he'll ever make one that good again.
I like it, too. But, I need more action in my Tarantino movies.
Not me. I'm perfectly content with shady people just doing some shady things.
