Who is that one band that used to have Wes Borland?
That was actually Limp Bizkit!
Oh that is right! I loved their song my way!
I really liked Behind Blue Eyes.
Isn't that a cover for another band?
Yes. It is from the band The Who.
Oh man I haven't heard The Who in so long!
The last time I heard them, they were playing at the superbowl.
Yeah. I think we was able to watch that game over at my parent's house.
Yeah. We having a music party during the game as well.
I think the DJ was playing 90s music pretty late.
He was. I think he really liked that genre of music, but so do I.
Is there an older song that you wish was still on the radio?
Anything by Korn would be great to hear all the time again!
Their Follow the leader album is honestly one of the best of all time!
Oh man I haven't heard that since I was in Jr. High school. Is that the Cd with Falling away from me?
I'm pretty sure it is!
I would really want to hear Taking Back Sunday!
We use to listen to them in the car all the time back in the day!
I really enjoy that style of music. They don't make it like they use to.
