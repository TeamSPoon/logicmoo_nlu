Want me to pick up some redbox movies on my way home?
Sure, I'm going to be off at five.
Any preference on the movies or genre?
How about something action-y?
Hmm Maybe a superhero movie?
Sure that would be cool.
You have been wanting to see deadpool haven't you?
Yeah, I saw it in theaters but it is so good, I'd love to see it again!
Do you think I'll like it?
Yes, it's really funny, you'll like it.
Okay, I'll get deadpool and what else?
What about Suicide Squad?
Hmmm, I already saw that... It wasn't very good.
Really? I heard great things about it.
Yeah I think it was kind of over rated honestly.
Okay what about the new Captain America Movie?
Civil War?
Yes, that one.
Okay that sounds good, I really liked the first one.
Me too, see you later.
