I'm pretty sure that Braveheart is the best movie ever made!
That's kind of a bold statement.
It's bold, but I just watched Braveheart for like the 20th time, and I'm fired up! FREEEEEEEEDOM!
It's a really good movie, don't get me wrong.
How about the scene where the knights all charge on horseback, and they stop them with a pike wall?
Yep, that was awesome.
Plus, that crazy Irish warrior guy for comic relief.
It's a really good movie. It's not the best movie ever, though.
Agree to disagree!
What about Citizen Kane?
Boring! I tried to watch it but fell asleep?
How about Pulp Fiction.
Pulp Fiction is a fine movie, but it doesn't get the blood pumping like Braveheart.
I heard the script from Braveheart was only 30 pages long.
I believe it, because instead of boring dialogue it was packed with combat and battles and stuff.
When I think of the dialogue of Pulp Fiction, it's hard for me to call that boring.
There were some boring parts.
Name one.
OK, I guess it wasn't boring. But Braveheart is still better.
They may take your life, but they'll never take your freedom to have terrible taste in movies!
