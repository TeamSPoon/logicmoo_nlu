Do you prefer the original Star War Trilogy, the prequels, or the new films coming out?
I think they all have their bright spots.  I really enjoyed The Rogue One film for example.
What did you like about it?
I enjoyed how the movie went more in depth about the events that happened prior to the first Star Wars film.
It did add a lot of good backstory to things.
Yep.  For example, one of the last scenes where the rebels are trying to escape with the Deathstar plans was amazing.
Watching Darth Vader attempting to get the Deathstar plans while cutting through Rebel soldiers was scary.
I know!  That was probably the most fearsome version of Darth Vader we have seen on screen.
Rogue One ended with a pretty cool nod to A New Hope with the hologram of Princess Leia.
Yep.  It is sad that we won't see more of her in the movies due to Carrie Fischer's passing.
