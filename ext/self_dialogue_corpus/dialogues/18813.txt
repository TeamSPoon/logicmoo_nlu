Have you heard of Prophets of Rage?
It's that band with the former members of Rage Against the Machine and Cypress Hill isn't it?
Yeah it also has a couple of members from Public Enemy. Do you like them?
I don't know. I really liked Rage Against the Machine but this sounds very different.
Yeah you can't really replicate the old Rage Against the Machine without the lead singer Zach de la Rocha. But I went to see them live and they sound pretty good.
Maybe if I saw them live I would like them better.
The concert was rocking! Tom Morello is an awesome guitarist.
Yeah he does some awesome special effects with his guitar. Is the drummer from Rage Against the Machine in that band?
Him and the old bassist from Rage are in this band. Chuck D from public enemy also is in the band.
That's kind of weird. I always thought of Chuck D as a gangster rapper.
They really mix well though. They have a sort of rock rap vibe to them that's catchy.
I guess I would have to listen to them live to really get a good feel for them.
If you get a chance to go to one of their concerts, you should definitely go.
I want to go see Green Day, but they are not touring anywhere near where I live.
Going to a Green Day concert would be awesome! They play with a lot of energy.
I would also love to see the Foo Fighters! I still listen to them on a regular basis!
Definitely, seeing the Foo Fighters live would also be awesome.
They just announced they will be releasing a new album shortly! It will be called "Concrete and Gold".
Really? Wow, I can't wait to hear it.
They will probably have a tour after they release their album so we might get a chance to see them live!
