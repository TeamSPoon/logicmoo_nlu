Hey do you want to come watch the NFL Football game at my house this Sunday?
Sure, I'll see if I can make it, I might even have tickets to go to one this weekend.
Really? Which one are you going to?
My friend has tickets to see the Miami Dolphins and I would love to take a road trip to Miami to see them Monday night.
That's amazing! I always thought you were a Tampa Bay fan more than a Miami fan.
Yeah I am but you cant turn down going to a Monday night football game especially when it's so warm.
How do you like their new logo and uniforms?
I think they are really cool. I do miss the old logo but I suppose the new dolphin could grow on me.
Do you think their color has changed? The green just seems a little bit different to me.
Yeah the colors seem a little different but whatever it takes to progress and update the team.
Speaking of updating the team, what do you think of them getting a DE in the first round of the draft?
I'm not really sure! I don't follow the team that closely to have an opinion but I hear he's really good.
Yeah my friend watched the entire draft at my house and now I have all this useless information in my head!
I wouldn't say it's useless, I wish I knew it before I go to see the game!
Where are your seats located in their stadium?
Right behind the goal posts so we'll get to see all the extra points go through the posts.
Hopefully you'll get to see a cool celebration if they all aren't still banned by the league.
Yeah, they're playing the Steelers so Antonio Brown will probably dance in the end zone for us!
I'm so jealous, I wish I could go too!
If I don't end up getting tickets we will have to watch it at your house!
