Are there many pop bands still?
Plenty! The Temper Trap is my favorite.
Their name sounds familiar. Would I know any of their songs?
Maybe! You might know "Sweet Disposition"
I think I have heard that one before!
You probably have. It has been licensed for many projects.
What kind of projects?
Movies like 500 Days of Summer and commercials for products like Coke
Those campaigns must pay super well!
They do! The band gets a big check when a company wants to use their music in an ad
