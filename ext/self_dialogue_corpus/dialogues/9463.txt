When did you first get into hip-hop?
I remember listening to the rap they would play on MTV. I must have been about 9 or 10.
What were you listening to at that point?
Eminem is the main rapper I remember.
So when did you get into the underground stuff?
That happened when I was 12 I think. I had a friend who played Aesop Rock for me.
Oh, that's cool. What song did you hear first?
He played "Daylight" for me.
That's a classic. Probably Aesop's best song.
Yeah, that song still holds up really well.
