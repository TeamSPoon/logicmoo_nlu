What team is your favorite?
I'm a fan of the Chargers.
Cool, Im a big fan of the Packers.
I don't like the Packers very much. I do respect Aaron Rodgers though.
Yeah we would be pretty bad without him.
We would also be bad without Rivers. Any players that you're looking forward to watching this year.
Yeah I'm excited for Martellus Bennet. I was amazed we signed a new free agent.
Yeah he will go well with Rodgers. I'm really hoping Melving Gordon can have another good yeah.
I'd like to see him do well, I was a fan of his on college. How do you think the Chargers will do this year?
I think they'll play really well but fall short of a wild card. How about you?
I think we should be able to win the division again. It's too bad your team's conference is so tough.
Yeah, that makes it hard for them to make the playoffs. Yours doesn't seem too bad does it?
No, unless one of the other teams surprises everyone, then we shouldn't have it too tough.
So who do you think will win the Super Bowl?
Thats tough but I have to say the Patriots. I think they'll end up playing us.
Yeah, I wouldn't be surprised if they won. I'm not sure who I would pick in the NFC.
Do you ever bet on football at all?
No I don't, but I know a few people that do.
I like to. Last year went well for me.
Thats cool, most people seem to lose.
