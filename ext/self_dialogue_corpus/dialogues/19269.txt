Man writing music is hard
How is it hard
Well writing the tabs
That seems like the easy part
Well memorizing each one is difficult
Hm
Well think about it you got to write each bit one at a time
Yeah?
So that makes it really hard
I can help if you want
not something someone else could help with
Why
Because i want this to be my music
Selfish much
I want to make my own music
I am joking
Are you sure
Yes i am sure
okay
Sorry man
