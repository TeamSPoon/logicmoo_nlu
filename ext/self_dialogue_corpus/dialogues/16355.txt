have you heard  leaked song of weekend tittled "starboy" don't sound nice though.
leaked song? i downloaded same  song on apple music as a new release yesterday and its a nice tune.
oh really
yes, i just sent you the link.
ok got it.
probably you didn't like it because the leak is just the unfinished version.
maybe true,although am not really a weekend fan,although i love the song he did for the movie "50 shades of grey"
"earn it" right
yeah thats the tittle, i did love that song when it came out then.
that was his break through song and since then i followed up on him.
well i really didn't enjoy other songs after "earned it".
get "starboy" and am sure you gonna enjoy it,sold over a million in 2 days.
wow are you serious, it must be a mad tune then, let me purchase it.
lol you should and he had future on the track as well
no way, the leaked version had him singing all through,no future on it.
oh i see more reason why you didn't enjoy it the first place.
i am getting it asap beside am a huge fan of future and i love his ragga feel on songs.
future actually made the song sound more  lovely.
i can tell, he always delivers.
you should purchase and listen then tell me what you think.
