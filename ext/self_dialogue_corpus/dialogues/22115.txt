I saw Dumb and Dumber again last night.
That's a classic.
It is so bad it's hilarious.
I think it's funny because it's awesome.
To each his own. I like it either way.
Yeah. I like the dog van.
The shaggy dog grooming van is awesome.
I would drive it.
There are some classic lines in that movie.
I know, it's so good.
How about when they drive on the moped to aspen.
It was so small.
The best part is when it gives Harry laxatives.
The toilet is broken too.
I nearly cried laughing.
Oh yeah. It was good.
Jim Carrey was amazing.
He is a genius.
The sequel was bad.
They shouldn't had made one.
