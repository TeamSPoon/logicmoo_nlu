Good morning!  Have you seen any movies lately?
Good morning!  Yeah I did. I went last night to the theater.
Really, what did you see?
I saw Alien Covenant!
Really?  What was it like?
Well, very suspenseful, and action packed.  Alien movies tend to be that way.
Was Sigourney Weaver in it again?
No, she was not.  This movie was before her in the movie time frame.
Ah, that's right.  It was after Prometheus
Yes, this one is a spinoff from Prometheus.
What were the graphics like?
The  graphics were stellar.  The creatures themselves were new and so frightening.
Did they have a queen in it?
Well, one did look like a queen, but it was a soldier one.
How many new creatures were in this one?
At least 3 new creatures were in it, very grotesque!  It was scary!
I want to go see it now!
Yes, you should.  Go see it on Tuesday.
Why Tuesday?
Because that is when the movies are at a discount.
