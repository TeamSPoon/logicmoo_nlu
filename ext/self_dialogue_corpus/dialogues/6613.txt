I love the whole if you lie your nose will grow thing in Pinocchio.
Why is that?
I use that line on my kids all the time.
Oh yeah?
Yeah. I tell them if they lie their nose will grow and Mr. Geppetto will get real sad.
Well, they're young still. I'm not sure that line will work for long.
Probably not, but I'm going to use it while I can.
Hey if it works, why stop?
My thoughts exactly.
You should tell them about the Island of Misfit Toys too.
