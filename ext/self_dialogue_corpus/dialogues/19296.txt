Hey man, have any good band recommendations?
Totally! What genre are you looking for?
Surprise me.
Well if you're looking for something alternative I'd say Stone Sour, Foo Fighters, or Smashing Pumpkins.
What about something pop?
Seriously?
My girlfriend got me hooked.
I can't blame you as mine did the same. The Chainsmokers, Katy Perry, and Bruno Mars is what I like.
So what do you listen to most lately?
Lately... mostly a lot of Falling In Reverse. I've played their newest album, Coming Home, so much I've practically worn it out.
Really? It's that good huh?
Absolutely. Speaking of new CDs, have you heard Linkin Park's latest album?
Man I haven't heard from them in years. Think the last one I heard was Minutes to Midnight.
Oh dude, that's a great one but One More Light is just as good if not better.
Personally my favorite has been and will always be Hybrid Theory.
Classic - one of my top 5 albums of all times. What'd you think of their remix cd - Reanimation?
Think there's only one or two songs on their I truly liked, but my girlfriend at the time it came out frikkin loved it.
Yeah, it wasn't really my cup of tea. It's the only one of theirs I never really liked.
Gotta hand it to Link Park though. I never expected them to last as long as they have.
True, true. They've really evolved and grown as artists and keep coming out with great new stuff... except Reanimation of course.
