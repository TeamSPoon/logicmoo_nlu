Do you like watching football more at the stadium or at home?
I think I like watching it more at home.
Really? why?
Because I like watching more than one game at a time.
Is that all?
If a game is bad or boring, I can watch a different one.
I guess that's a good reason.
I can also eat whatever I want, and drink whatever I want.
Those $7 beers do get kind of old.
I can invite whoever I want over to watch it with me, and we don't have to pay a ridiculous amount to get in.
Those are all good points.
Yeah, why were you asking?
I had an extra ticket for the Cowboys game, I thought maybe you would be interested.
I am interested!
I thought you said you prefer to watch it at home?
I do, unless I can go to a game with my best friend.
Haha, good save.
What time should I be ready?
How's around 10 sound?
sounds perfect!
