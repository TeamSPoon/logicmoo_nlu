Hey, I just stumbled upon this great hip hop group.
Which one?
They are called Heiruspecs.
I remember listening to them, they were around in the early 2000s right?
Yea, I think so.
They did Small Steps and A Tiger Dancing.
Yea, that is them, I had never heard of them before.
They are amazing, I used to listen to them all the time.
What song do you like the most.
I had always really like Heartstrings.
That beat is so good, the lyrics are not really my style though.
I also really like Two Fold.
I think that is my favorite song.
Of the album?
No, of Heiruspecs period.
That song is really amazing, it may also be my favorite.
I can't believe you've never brought them up before.
I actually completely forgot about them until now.
Well, you are welcome for reintroducing you.
Thanks, another great band to listen to!
