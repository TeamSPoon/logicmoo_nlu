Bruno Mars moved up on the Billboards Chart again with his latest song.
Which song is that?
That's What I Like is now number 3, peak performance of the song was number 1.
Bruno is pretty cool, his music is very catchy.  It's hard not to dance with his music.
I know!  Yeah, his song has been on the charts for 22 weeks now.
I am sure he has some awards for his performances over the past few years
He has won BET Award for Video Director of the Year as one of them!
I think he also won Teen Choice Award for Single Male Artist too.
What are some of your favorite songs of his that he has done?
Uptown Funk/Formation is one of all time favorites, a great dance song!
When I Was Your Man is also fantastic, I have it on my playlist today.
I bought his album 24K Magic, it is fantastic.
I think Versace on The Floor is on that album, right?
Yeah it is, I love that one.
When was 24K Magic released to the public?
I think it was November 2016.
Did you have to buy it early?
Yes, it had already sold out before I even could get it.
Wow, how long were on the waiting list?
I think about 3 weeks.
