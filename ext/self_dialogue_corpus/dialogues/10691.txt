Are you going to see the new Fast & Furious film?
Maybe. It's not the same without Paul Walker.
Agreed, but the movies are always good, no matter the cast.
I know. Vin Diesel is my favorite actor.
Really? Mine is Dwayne Johnson.
You can't go wrong with that cast!
I know! And the action is amazing.
They sure are highly budgeted films.
Do you think they will make a ninth film?
No, I doubt it.
