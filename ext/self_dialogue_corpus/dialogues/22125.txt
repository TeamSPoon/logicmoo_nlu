I want to see the new Blade Runner in IMAX.
Yeah that seems like a movie that's definitely worth seeing in IMAX.
There aren't many that I'll spend the extra money on but the shots in the new Blade Runner look so beautiful.
Definitely one of those films that you want to just wrap yourself in for the duration of it.
The only things I've seen in IMAX are Avatar and Captain America: Civil War.
Why did you see Civil War in IMAX?
Friends wanted to go and I figured seeing all these heroes clash on a screen like that would be cool.
How was it?
I loved it, I thought it was definitely worth seeing in IMAX.
I imagine the airport scene was quite the sight to behold.
Oh it was, seeing all of them make their entraces, including Spider-Man was a spectacle.
I want to see The Last Jedi in IMAX.
Any kind of science fiction romp would be beautiful to see on that screen.
Let's make a deal then, we will see the final Star Wars movie in the new trilogy in IMAX.
You have yourself a deal, that will certainly be an event.
Yeah one of those releases that is worth the extra cash on pedigree alone.
Those don't happen often, usually it's a compromise.
Yeah movies being seen on pedigree alone is a lot less common.
Even respected directors like Ridley Scott are pumping out garbage these days.
Please don't remind me that he has a Gladiator sequel in the works.
