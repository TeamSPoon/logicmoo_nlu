Are brooches still popular?
I don't know but I still wear them.
I like to use them to keep my scarbes the way I want.
I do that and also just pin them on my shirts.
I remember seeing you wear a cute watermelon one the other day. That actually made me think of it.
That's my favorite one.
Where do you usually find them?
Usually secondhand stores.
Like the one down the street?
I've gotten at least ten there.
I'll have to get some then. Do they have scarves?
Usually tons.
I love scarves.
Me too and they are good with brooches.
I think so too.
That's all that matters.
I love how you don't get hung up on trends.
Who knows? We might set our own.
Maybe.
Wear what you like. Don't worry so much.
