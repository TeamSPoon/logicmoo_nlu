What did you think of Tarzan.
I didn't really like it.
Why not?
Pretty boring.
I guess I could see that.
I think they could have done it better.
Fair enough.
The Disney one was great.
Agreed.
Yeah, if they could do a live action a little more in that vein.
That would be cool.
Yeah, I'd definitely buy a ticket for that!
Probably won't happen, though.
Not for a while at least.
Well, not gonna hold my breath!
Yeah, that would not be wise.
At any rate, I'll keep my ear to the ground and let you know if I hear of anything.
Appriciated!
Let's get togeter some time and catch a flick.
That'd be great!
