Are you into the Star Wars movies?
You know, I've never seen any of them.
Whoa!  That is quite shocking.
I was going to try to get into them, but there are so many I don't know which ones to start with.
Yes, it can get confusing.
Do I start with timeline order or movie release order?
I would go with movie release order, that way you can see the movies the way they were made.
Yeah, I think that's a good idea.  Maybe I'll start watching them in time for the new one to be released.
I think you should definitely give them a chance.  They are classics!
I'm going to spend all weekend watching them, then.  It is settled!
