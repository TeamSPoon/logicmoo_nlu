I just saw the first Harry Potter movie.
The Sorcerer's Stone?  I loved it.  Who directed it?
Chris Columbus.
Emma Watson was so cute in that.
Yes, pre-puberty.
Who played the ghost?
John Cleese!
I loved him th Monty Python.
Yes, he was cool.  I loved the chess match.
I heard there was an increase in chess set sales after that.
