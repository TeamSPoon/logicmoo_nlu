I want to take my niece to a movie, any suggestions?
Take her to see Boss Baby. It was cute.
We saw that it was really cute and funny. The chase scene made us laugh.
Me too. I think the new Diary of a Winpy Kid movie just came out.
That series is great. We love the books and the movies but I hear the new movie isn't great.
That's true, I read the reviews and they were definitely lackluster.
When does the Captain Underpants movie come out?
Next month, I can't wait to bring my daughter to see it.
I hope another great kid's movie like Trolls comes out soon.
We loved Trolls. The music was fantastic and the message was important.
I thought so too.
Did you see Moana?
Yes, the music in that movie was even better than Trolls!
I loved how Disney was able to show so much authentic ancient Polynesian culture.
I really enjoyed that the heroine of this Disney movie wasn't technically a princess for once.
I liked that too. The humor was also perfectly timed.
The landscapes were gorgeous.
They were the narration was of the highest level as usual. I also liked how young girls can related to Moana as a strong family oriented character.
Her character was very well written.
I hope Disney pursues more projects like Moana in the future.
