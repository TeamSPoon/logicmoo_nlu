So how do you think the indians will make it to the series again this year?
I sure hope so i would like to see them win it, but im not sure i heard they lost some players.
Ya i heard that too, hopefully it wasn't anyone we needed.
I know speaking of what we need we need some more pitchers.
Ya i'll second that, the only thing i believe we are good on is the people in the outfield.
The indians outfield is pretty good, they were tearing it up last season.
Definitely were, although i cant remember his name but one guy was horrible, especially during the world series.
I think i know the guy your talking about, was he the one that kept getting waved off but ran in anyways to try and catch it.
Yep i remember he cost the indians an easy out because he messed up the guy that was waving him off.
That was pretty awful, hopefully the indians replaced him this year.
Have you gone and seen any games yet?
No I havent yet.
Thats a bummer I'm going up at the end of the month to see them play the royals.
O nice i hear its going to be a good game.
I heard that too, even if it isn't its still dollar a dog night!
O score, i love those nights.
Me too i always eat way more than i should.
You betting on the game?
I usually do, im betting my buddy they win by 3 runs.
I think thats a safe bet, i heard they are supposed to beat the royals fairly easily.
