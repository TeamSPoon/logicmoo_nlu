Have you seen any of the Beatles movies?
Nope, like Yellow Submarine, right?
Yes, Yellow Submarine is one, but it's not their most influential.
What is?
A Hard Day's Night from 1964.
What made it so influential?
Have you heard of The Monkees?
Yeah, they were a British pop band with a TV show, right?
Yes, A Hard Day's Night was the inspiration behind that show. A Hard Day's Night is also credited with inspiring many spy films too!
Wow, that's incredible. I need to watch it!
