What is your favorite comedy movie?
Probably, Happy Gilmore, Adam Sandler really hits the mark with that one.
I liked that a lot too. I also liked Happy Gilmore.
All of his early movies are great.
Do you remember Airheads?
Yes! Wasn't Brendan Fraser in that one?
He was and so was Steve Buscemi.
Adam Sandler was such a lovable oaf in that movie.
He was, even though they were breaking the law, you still rooted for them.
I was so happy they won in the end.
