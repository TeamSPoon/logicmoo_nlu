What movies have you seen recently?
I saw Sausage Party.
Oh really?
Yeah with Kristen Wiig.
Was it good?
I liked it but it was definitely not for kids.
Yeah it seems weird that it is animated though.
That is what makes it funny.
Was it a long movie?
It was normal length.
Would I like it?
Maybe you would.
I saw that movie with Amy schemer and Goldie Han yesterday.
Oh wow I wanted to see it!
It was not that good.
Oh that is a disappointment.
Yeah I expected better.
Yeah I won't see it then.
Well anyways nice talking to you!
You too!
