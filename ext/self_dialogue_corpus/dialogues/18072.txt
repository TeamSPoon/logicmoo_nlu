Hi Madi, what are you listening to?
Oh, hi Wanda, I'm listening to 21 Pilots.
21 Pilots?  I haven't heard of them.
What? I'm shocked that you haven't heard of them, they are amazing!
Really, can I listen?
Of course, here are my headphones
Hmmm...I have heard this before.
Cool, what do you think?
I'm really not that impressed?
Wow, I can't believe you said that.
I'm sorry, you must like them a lot.
I do, they are my favorite.
I must be too old to enjoy them.  Ha ha
I do, it's impressive that there are only two members of the band?
Really?
Yeah, Tyler plays most of the instruments and sings.
What does the other guy do?
Josh plays the drums mainly.
I bet the singer goes solo at some point then.
I doubt it!  They're best friends!
