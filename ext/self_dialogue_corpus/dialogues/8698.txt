One thing we have in common is our enjoyment of rock music.
For sure! What was your favorite rock band growing up?
Linkin Park comes to mind, at the moment. How about you?
I really enjoyed KoRn, when I was in middle school. Linkin Park was great, too.
Whenever I hear KoRn, I instantly think of middle school, when I was 14 or so.
I feel the same way with Linkin Park. What was your favorite album by them?
The album that had "Crawling" on it. I believe it was Hybrid Theory?
Yes I think you are right and that is a classic album! "Issues" is my favorite KoRn album.
Did that have "Make Me Bad" on it? That's my all-time favorite song by them.
I believe it did, yes. That song is truly a classic!
