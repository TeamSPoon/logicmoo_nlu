Hey did you watch the new wonder woman movie?
No i didnt but i heard it was really empowering and a must see
I didnt see it either i am trying to see it this weekend
Oh ok, well i think its about time they had a female super hero
Yea i think shes the only one besides catwoman, but i dont know if she would be considered a hero
Yea i dont think she counts as a super hero
Yea your right super hero would be spiderman because he actually tried to save people
Yea he used his powers for good use, he was a like a policeman and fireman all in one
Yea, thats why i dont understand why he had so many enemies he was actually trying to help people
Well the one person that wanted him dead was because he had killed his father so it was for revenge
