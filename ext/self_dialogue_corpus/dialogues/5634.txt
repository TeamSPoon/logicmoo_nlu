I think Frozen is this generation's Lion King.
Do you think so? They're such different movies.
I know, but I think they just both took off in the same way.
Oh, do you think they both just became really popular?
Yeah, and they also both have songs everyone knows.
The "Let It Go" song kind of annoys me sometimes.
I agree. I liked it at first, but now I can't stand it.
The songs from The Lion King didn't annoy me like that.
Maybe that had something to do with us being kids with The Lion King came out though.
Maybe you're right.
