Hey man, how's it going?
Good dude, what's up with you?
Oh, nothing much, just starting out my summer break
That's cool. Any big plans?
Some trips and then I want to get caught up on some good movies.
Yeah, that sounds like a plan. What movies are you going to see?
I want to see the new Baywatch movie
Oh I hear that's horrible
Oh whatever, it has gorgeous girls in bathing suits in it.
Yeah, but sometimes not even that can overcome bad acting
But it also has the Rock in it. He's a good actor
Oh please.
He was good in Fast and Furious
Oh come on now. That was so campy
No, I thought he did a good job
No way, those movies are horrible
Are you kidding?! They're great
No way man. The plots are full of holes
Well we'll have to agree to disagree on this one
Okay fine.
