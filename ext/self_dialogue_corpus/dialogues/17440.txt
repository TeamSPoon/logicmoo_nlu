Didn't you say you like Gospel music?
Yes I did, it's some of my favorite music.
I like it too but need to be in the right mood.
We listen to it at our house when getting ready for church.
I like how it makes you feel inspired and ready to praise God.
I do too! It's infectious.
I love to listen to Fred Hammond.
He's pretty good!
My husband plays "We lift our hands in the Sanctuary."
Who sings that song?
Kurt Carr sings that one.
Oh right! I remember that now.
He's a pretty good artist.
What else does he sing?
He also sings "I almost Let Go."
Oh okay, I'm not very familiar with that song but may have heard it before.
I wish they sang more songs like Gospel music in my church.
Me too, my church isn't as lively as I would like.
Maybe one day I can go to a Gospel concert, that would be cool.
Let me know if you do! I want to tag along too.
