I can't stand screamo-
Oh, totally agreed.
Just the worst, alarming sounds coming out of the vocalist's mouths.
Yeah. But I'll admit I dug it in college.
Really?! How?!
I don't know. Like we're thinking 30 Seconds To Mars-type stuff here, right?
Yeah, something like that. I was thinking Thursday.
Okay so yeah. I don't know I just went through a phase of loving emo-
Emo and screamo are different, though.
Yeah but I'd forfeit the screaming chorus in favor of the other lyrics of the song.
That's a huge sacrifice. Choruses are sort of important.
I know. It's whatever. I loved Taking Back Sunday and Bright Eyes.
Dude... I can't imagine you listening to them.
I know, right? I did anyway, though.
Do you have memories attached to them?
Uh, being sad and alone in my dorm room?
That's sad.
I had my emo music, though, hahaha.
Well, I kinda thank god I never hit that phase.
Eh, it wasn't that bad. It was fun learning new genres, at the very least.
