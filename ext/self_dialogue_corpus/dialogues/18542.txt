Have you ever heard of Richard Cheese?
No, who is that?
He is this parody singer.
Kind of like Weird Al?
Yeah, kind of, but not really.
Well, what's the difference?
Weird Al keeps the melody and kind of changes the words.
And this Richard guy does the opposite?
Pretty much.  He keeps the lyrics and turns the song into lounge music.
Lounge music?
Yeah, it sounds like something people would have listened to in a casino decades ago.
Oh, that sounds so cheesy.  Actually like it would be funny, though.
It is cheesy.  That's probably why he used Cheese as his name.
Oh, I forgot you said that!  So, it's like pianos and trumpets?
Yeah, stuff like that.  And the songs are everything from Michael Jackson to Rage Against the Machine.
Oh gosh.  Rage Against the Machine with pianos and trumpets?
Yes, and it's hilarious.
Do you have a copy of this?
I actually have some of his music on my phone.
You'll have to let me hear this!
