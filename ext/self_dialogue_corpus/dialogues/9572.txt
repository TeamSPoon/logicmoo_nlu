I cannot stand Kanye West.
Man, that's some basic business to hate Kanye.
Why should I think any differently of him?
Once you realize that he has purposefully pushed the bounds as a performance artist for years, you will begin to understand.
Oh here we go with that illuminati stuff.
Kanye's artistry is deep and has adapted quite well to the changing landscape.
I did like the song "Through the Wire".
The Chaka Kahn sample used on the track is amazing.
What happened to the old Kanye?
If I knew the answer to that question, I would be one rich person.
