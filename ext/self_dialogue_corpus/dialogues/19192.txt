Do you know who Testament are?
I've heard of them. They were popular in the 80s, weren't they?
Yup. They came around the same time as Metallica.
I've also heard that they're super underrated.
You'd be right in saying that.
Why, though? What's so special?
It's just that so many people see the Big 4 as the only thrash bands without knowing that there's others that do it better.
Are they still around?
Yes, and would you like to know something?
What is it?
They're all over 50, and their music is more aggressive than even Slayer's.
That's a very bold claim right there.
Trust me, I can back it up. Just listen to Brotherhood of the Snake.
Is that their most recent album?
That's right. For having members all above 50, it's unbelievable how young they still sound.
You''re really trying your best to get them over, aren't you?
Of course. Like you even said, they're super underrated.
Must be really good if you're giving them this high praise.
Like I said, just look the album up. You won't be disappointed.
Alright then. Let's put your words to the test.
