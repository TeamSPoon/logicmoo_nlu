Did you see Katy Perry's performance on SNL last week?
No, I missed it. Why?
It was crazy. She has a completely new style muscially and physically.
What's so different about it?
Well, she performed this song "Swish Swish." It almost had a club or techno beat.
She's know for her over-the-top performances. Did she do anything special for performing this song?
She had a catwalk of drag queens and she was wearing this Beetlejuice like top. The song was kind of catchy though.
Yeah, I've heard that one. It is almost like a blend between hip hop and eighties Madonna.
Oh, she also had this kid in a backpack dancing. He was doing crazy hand movements.
Well, you can never say that you're not entertained or capitvated when she takes the stage.
Yeah. That is very true because there's always lots to look at for her stage performances.
What about the second song she performed.
She did the song "Bon App√©tit" featuing Migos. It's almost got a latin dance and hip hop blend going on.
Yeah. What did she do for the stage performance?
She was laying and dancing on a banquet table surrounded by fruit.
Wow, that's actually pretty tame compared to her other performances.
Well, she also had people sitting around the table pretending to seductively eat the fruit.
Yeah, I figured there had to be something more to it. It seemed to basic.
All in all, it was a pretty good performance. The music was danceable.
Im going to have to go back and watch it. Thanks.
