What's your favorite brand at the moment?
I like this new brand I found called Trailing Nimbus.
I've never heard of them.
They make modern, sort of sci-fi stuff. They have a mix of Japanese style and afro-futurism going on.
That sounds very interesting.
Yeah, I like what they're doing quite a bit.
How did you find out about them?
I found their stuff on Tumblr actually.
That's funny. I didn't expect that.
Yeah, one of their shirts showed up on my timeline one day.
Are you getting sick of Palace and Supreme yet?
I don't know. They still put out good stuff.
Yeah, I guess. They're just so hyped up now.
I know what you mean.
I guess I still like feeling like I'm wearing something that everyone doesn't know about.
I'm sort of the same way. I like having unique clothes.
If something is good enough it will eventually been seen by everyone.
Right. The obscure stuff usually doesn't stay obscure forever.
Well, in the end I wear what I think looks the best.
I agree with that. It's about the clothes, not the brands.
