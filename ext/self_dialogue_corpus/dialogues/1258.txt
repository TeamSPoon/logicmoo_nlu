So do you watch football?
Yeah, I'm for the Green bay packers
Pretty cool. I've never been much a fan of football.
Why not?
Well I just think other sports are more interesting.
What's uninteresting about football?
It just feels slow, and less skill.
Okay dude. You gotta love the beauty and strength in football.
And how's that?
Football is about the bulk of the frontline and the precision of the backline
Go on.
In a sense. Football is like a war, breaking enemy lines. It's pretty complicated and there are so many stratgies.
I guess I never really followed football that closely.
You have all these unique soldiers joining the battlefield. The meta game shifts constantly.
In that sense, football seems pretty interesting. Other sports don't have too much meta shift.
Exactly. We should watch a game sometime. Root for the packers with me.
Nah dude. The patriots!
Don't be a bandwagon man.
PATRIOTS!
Alright alright. I'll order the pizza.
