What is the best Schwarzenegger Action movie?
I have always thought that Terminator 2 is probably his best.
Yeah, that one is good, but I was wondering about his lesser known stuff.
Most of them are pretty weak 80s action plots, but the sure have a lot of action. Have you ever seen The 6th Day
No. What is it about?
It is pretty wild. It is about human cloning.
That sounds cool! Who else is in it?
It has Michael Rappaport and Robert Duvall.
I like Robert Duvall. Wasn't he in Apocalypse Now?
He sure was. He was the surfer.
