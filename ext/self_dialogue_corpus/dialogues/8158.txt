I love Queen. They are timeless.
Yeah, they are. Freddie Mercury's voice is amazing. No one can hit those notes like him.
I know it was so sad to loose such a great voice to the world.
It was. He was so creative and theatrical in his performances.
I know they talk about the crowds that would show up for the shows and it was just crazy.
They had so many great song that were so completely different.
Yeah, how do you go from Bohemian Rhapsody to We are the Champions?
That is every sport fans favorite song, no doubt.
That's because "We Will Rock You!"
Ha! Rock on Freddie, you will be missed!
