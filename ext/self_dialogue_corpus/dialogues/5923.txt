What is your favorite Disney movie?
I'd have to say Toy Story.
That is a great one.
I liked the second one but not the third.
I didn't see the third one.
It was okay, but they should've stopped at two.
Seems a lot of movies go overboard.
Woody and Buzz are classics.
They are good characters in the movie.
Buzz is my favorite.
