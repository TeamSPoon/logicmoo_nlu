Who are the greatest tight ends in the NFL?
Well Gronkowski has a shot, but he's always injured.
Yes, his problem is health.
I think he will stay healthy this year.
Why do you think that?
I believe the Patriots will use him more sparingly.
That might be true - they should save him for the playoffs.
I agree - I think he will have another dominant year, though.
What do you think of Aaron Hernandez?
His story is a damn shame.
He could have been one of the greats.
He had everything going for him, and was even on The Patriots.
He had such potential, and already had a great season under his belt.
He would have been dominant with Brady.
Yes, this is true. Do you like Tony Gonzalez?
He might be the greatest receiving tight end ever.
I think so too - he has so much yardage!
I think he may have the most yardage of any tight end ever.
I think this is true, he will be missed.
I surely miss him - such a great player.
