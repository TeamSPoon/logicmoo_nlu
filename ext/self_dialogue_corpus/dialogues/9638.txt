So, do you like rap and hip-hop or not? I've been thinking lately that it still gets a bad reputation.
No, I definitely like it. It totally depends on the style though--I'm not into really violent imagery.
Yeah, I totally agree--but it's important to remember that with the good stuff, that imagery serves a purpose.
Oh no, definitely--I just don't want it to feel cheap or unnecessary, you know?
Have you listened to Kendrick Lamar yet? I know that's an obvious one, but he's just great.
Ha--of course I have! He's great. He's an exception to that for sure.
You know who he reminds me of? Atmosphere. It's really sentimental but also hard and intense, you know what I mean?
For sure. You grew up in Seattle, do you like Blue Scholars?
Yeah, I love their shtick! It's a great take on the love-of-hometown theme.
Of course, everyone needs some Nicki Minaj too--can't forget the ladies!
