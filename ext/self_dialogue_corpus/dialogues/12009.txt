I don't know, ultimately I really don't think the prequels were necessary.
Why do you say that?
Well, they're all premised around Anakin turning into Darth Vader, which really isn't much of a story.  At least, not one that needed THREE movies to tell.
Yeah, but he's a pivot character in the story arc.
Ahh.. I don't really buy that.  Yeah, in Empire and Jedi he's big, but in the first film he's pretty much just a lapdog of a Grand Moff Tarkin.  He even orders Vader around like a minion in a few scenes.
Hmm.. not sure.. been awhile since I've seen the first film.
Yeah, there's a scene where Vader's choking a guy out for insulting the force and the Admiral is like, "That's enough." And Vader STOPS what he's doing.
Doesn't happen in the second film.
Well, the Admiral guy, in fact everyone on board the Death Star died, so yeah.
I think the story of Anakin's fall could have been good, they just should have handled it differently.
