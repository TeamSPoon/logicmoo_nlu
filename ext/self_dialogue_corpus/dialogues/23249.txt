did you watch pulp fiction
who hasn't watched it
that movie is quentins best
remember the convo about foot rubs?
yeah, quentin loves thos weird conversations
he puts it in all of his movies
that movie was confusing at first
because of the arrangement of the scenes?
yeah because travolta was dead then he is in another scene later on
yeah, it takes a little bit of getting used to
i had to watch it again
you should.
its hard to get everything out of a movie the first time
that is very true.
you always miss little things in the movie
the movie was so intense though
that bible scene is so iconic
samual jackson can do no wrong in film
he plays the same character kinda
a rough cursing man
