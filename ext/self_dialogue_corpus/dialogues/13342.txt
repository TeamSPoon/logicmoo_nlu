Which Star Wars movie was your least favorite?
Star Wars the clone wars.
Why is that?
Well I just did not like the plot, just felt forced.
What did you think of Jar Jar Binks?
I did not like him as a character he felt really out of place.
He looks the part though yeah his character is a little goofy though.
It was very off putting for me.
I think that was one of my favorite movies of the franchise.
That's interesting guess we all have different tastes.
