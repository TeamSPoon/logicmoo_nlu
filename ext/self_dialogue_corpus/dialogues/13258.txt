Star Wars the original movie was the best!  Do you agree or not?
I agree, that it was the best.  I remember when it came out how different and grandiose it was.
The anticipation for the Empire Strike back was huge.  Who was your favorite character?
I liked Han Solo.  He was the outside of the lines guy.  Who did you like?
I enjoyed Luke.  He was the unsung hero trying to find his way.
He did a good job and the story really revolved around him.
The comic relief per se for such a large block buster.
R2D2 was brilliant without being able to talk.  Totally understood his role and message.
C3PO was very good and they reminded me of Bud Abbott and Lou Costello.
I definitely could see that parellel.
