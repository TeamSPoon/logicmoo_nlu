Did you see the new Linklater movie?
Are you talking about Boyhood?
No, the newer one. It is about the 70s.
The follow up to Dazed and Confused?
Yes, that movie.
No, I actually haven't seen it yet. Is it any good?
It's not my favorite of his. But I enjoyed it.
Should I check it out? Is it worth a ticket?
You could probably just rent it. You don't need to see it in theaters.
What should I see then?
Maybe the new Disney movie!
Guardians of the Galaxy?
Yes, that one. I hear it's great.
Yes, I heard it made a lot of money.
Disney movies always tend to make lots of money.
You're right. Especially ones with stars in them.
Chris Pratt is in this one. He is excellent I hear.
He usually is great. He's so funny.
I loved him in Jurassic Park.
Me too! That was an excellent remake.
