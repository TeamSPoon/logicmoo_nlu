Did you see Beauty and Beast?
The live action film?
Yeah. It was just released on video.
No. I saw the original cartoon version.
I saw it in theaters and I loved it. Emma Watson played a great Belle.
I saw the Cinderella remake and I wasn't too impressed.
Me too. But Beauty and the Beast is much better.
Is it still a musical?
Yes. And the songs are some of my favorite scenes.
The tavern scene with Gaston in the cartoon was so funny.
You should really see this one then. Gaston and Lefou were cast perfectly.
What about the Be Our Guest song? Was that in it?
Yep. The whole movie stayed pretty true to the original.
That's good to hear. I hate when remakes take a classic movie and ruin it.
I know what you mean. So are you gonna check it out.
Yeah, probably.
Well, I hope you like it.
Me too. But even if I don't I'm sure my daughter will.
True, my daughter even liked the new Cinderella. Girls love princesses!
Yes they do!
