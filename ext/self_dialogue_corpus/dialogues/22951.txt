Did you ever watch "Kill Bill"?
Oh, GOD that was gross.
What do you expect from Quentin Tarantino, the guy is weird.
Yeah, but his movies are awesome.
Remember that one school girl who was kicking tail until she got totally bashed in the head?
Gogo Yubari!
Her entrance made me laugh so much.
Yeah, innocent little Japanese school girl with a ball and chain ready to kill.
That scene was unbelievable!
When that ball went through the table and Black Mamba had to lean back to avoid it...I loved that.
Yeah, but it was pretty bad acting which kind of ruined it.
Until Black Mamba was being choked, that looked real.
Yeah, that's true, her face was all red and her eyes were bugging out.
Then the nail board to the head and the innocent school girl was out.
It was funny but sick at the same time.
Yeah, definitely leaves you feeling weird, like your body doesn't know if it should laugh or recoil in disgust.
And then it gets worse!
Yeah, that's when Lucy Liu comes on scene.
When the music kicks in, you know it's about to get good.
I need to rent that movie again.
