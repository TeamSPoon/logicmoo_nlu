I have a question about The Empire Strikes back.
Ok, what is it?
Do you remember the scene where Luke goes in the cave, fights Vader, and is revealed to be himself under the helmet?
Yes, what about it?
What did that mean?
It meant that Luke had to deal with the temptation of the Dark Side.
How so?
Vader already knows Luke is his son before they fight.
Oh ok.
So Vader uses this by tempting Luke to join him and overthrow the Emperor.
But doesn't the Emperor suspect this.
Of course, he's a Sith and they do this all the time.
Then why doesn't the Emperor kill Vader and take Luke instead?
He actually considers it when Vader and Luke fight.
When does he do that?
He told Luke he felt the anger in him when fleet attacked the Death Star in Return of the Jedi.
So it didn't matter to the Emperor if Vader lived or dies?
Not at all.
The Dark side is complicated.
Not really, just absolute.
