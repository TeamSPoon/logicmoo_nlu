The Silence of the Lambs was my favorite thriller movie of all time
I thought Anthony Hopkins killed that role.
Jodie Foster also played a great role.
Yeah they combined to make a great movie.
Jonathan Demme was awesome in it as well.
Hopkins played such a great psycho
I actually felt his performance
Those are the best kind of thrillers
Yeah and you go home with a weird feeling.
Like you are all tense and stuff
