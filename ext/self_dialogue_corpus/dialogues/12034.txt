Which character in the franchise do you think had the best story arc?
Darth Vader, by far. He just had such a long journey, especially once the prequels came out.
I completely agree. You found yourself wondering towards Empire if this was any hope for him at all.
Definitely. But I think once it's revealed that he is Luke's father, it becomes a bit more apparent.
That is interesting. How did you figure at that point?
Because Luke, who is completely fighting the good fight, now knows his father was not murdered, and is indeed Darth Vader. You can't help but feel that Luke will try to help him "heal", so to speak.
Makes total sense. And of course, you do know "Return of the Jedi" is named after Vader, right?
Of course. At the very end, where he saves Luke from the Emperor.
Yes. Vader became Anakin Skywalker and a Jedi, once again.
By sacrificing himself for his son, he didn't die just a Jedi, but a hero.
