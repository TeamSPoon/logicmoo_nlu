Did you ever see Moneyball?
Is that the one with Brad Pitt?
Yes, he plays a GM for the Oakland A's
Yes, it was pretty good.
I read the book. The book was better.
Isn't the book always better?
Sometimes. Depends on the movie. Though
Well I thought Brad Pitt did a good job in Moneyball.
Yeah it was a pretty good role for him.
I think he's a better actor than most people think.
What are some of your other favorite movies with him starring?
Well I really liked Se7en.
Ohhh, that was a scary one.
Yeah, still gives me the creeps.
And he was great in Fight Club.
Oh another really underrated film.
Yeah, Ed Norton also does a great job in that.
Yeah, quite the twist at the end.
Yes, but you're not allowed to talk about Fight Club.
Right. All things that happen in Fight Club stay in Fight Club.
