What's your favorite superhero movie?
The Avengers hands down.
What makes it the best movie to you?
Great writing and direction by Joss Whedon. I was so hyped to see all those characters together.
Is it better than Captain America, Winter Soldier? Everyone says that's the best.
Maybe because  grew up reading the Avengers but I love the Angers.
Why?
Robert Downey as Iron Man. Loki was the best bad guy. Tony Stark sacrificing himself to save the world. The Hulk.
Well, there was a lot of cool stuff in that movie.
I forgot Nick Fury was ultra cool. Did you know the writer also wrote the Buffy the Vampire TV show?
