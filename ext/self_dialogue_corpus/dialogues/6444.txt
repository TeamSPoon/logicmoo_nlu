Why was Moana so bad?
What?  Bad, how do you mean?
I just didn't like the film.  It was boring.
I completely disagree, why do you say that?
It took forever to get to point.
You mean that the island really wasn't bad, just misunderstood?
Right.  Spent way too much time on Maui dinking around.
You're probably on your own island with this stance.
Hey, just saying, sometimes Disney dropped the ball and they did on this one.
You're entitled to your opinion I guess.
