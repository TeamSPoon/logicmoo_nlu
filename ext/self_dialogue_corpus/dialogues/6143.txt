I recently just watched Moana on Netlix. Have you seen it?
No, actually. I haven't gotten a chance to see it yet.
You definitely should watch it, it's a great movie.
I bet it is! I usually love all Disney movies. I love re-watching older ones.
Which movies do you re-watch?
I really love Mulan and the Jungle Book.
I agree about Mulan. Mooshoo is one of my favorite Disney characters.
I can't wait until the live action version comes out!
Same here!! If it's anything like the new Jungle Book, it's going to be amazing.
We definitely should go see it when it comes out.
