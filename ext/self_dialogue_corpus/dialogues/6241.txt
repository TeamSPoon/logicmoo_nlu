I really think Disney waited too long when they made Cars 3.
Yeah, it's like they create a movie, and then a decade later they make a sequel!
I totally agree! Anyways, who do you hate the most in Hercules?
Honestly, I'll have to go with Meg, hands down. She was a stereotypical epitome of a damsel in distress, and she was as skinny as a twig!
I agree. She looked really fragile, i was kind of afraid her hair might weigh her down!
Ha ha ha! Well, who was your favorite character in Hercules?
I think Phil was my favorite character, he was really helpful to Hercules and he never gave up on him.
Yeah, Phil was pretty cool.
Pretty cool?! TOTALLY COOL, more like it!!
I guess so...
