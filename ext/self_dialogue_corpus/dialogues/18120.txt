Who's your favorite live performer ever.
That I have seen?
Yes,you personally.
Paul McCartney.
Really?
By far.
Wow,pretty good huh.
Plays for three hours non stop.
He has a lot of songs.
He plays around forty songs.
That's hard to believe.
Lots of Beatles songs.
I imagine.
Hey Jude brings the whole crowd into it.
Great to hear.
He ends with the end.
The abbey road medley?
Yes,start to finish.
Couldn't ask for more.
No,you can't.
