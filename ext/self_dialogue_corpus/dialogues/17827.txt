Alright, who is favorite Country rock band?
I'd have to say Big And Rich.
Okay, what's your favorite Big and Rich songs?
The first, I'd say, is Rollin: The Ballad of Big and Rich.
Okay, that is a a good one. What would be your second choice.
That would have to be Save a Horse, RIde a Cowboy.
Yeah, that one is a pretty good song.
Yes, it is. But my third favorite Big and Rich song would have to be Comin' to Your City.
Isn't that the one with the really weird music video?
Yes, Aliens, Marilyn Manson cameo, and the midgets.
Yep, weird as anything. Anymore Big and Rick songs you particularly like?
Well, I do like Between Rasing Hell and Amazing Grace pretty well.
I'm not familiar with that one, or I've forgotten it. Does it have a music video.
Yes, it is set up like a Western movie.
Really, what happens.
Big Kenny plays a drunk preacher in Western town, who helps a wounded gunfighter, played by John Rich.
Well, it seems to fit the song pretty well, theme wise.
Yes, they wind up having a shootout with the men hunting for John and Kenny helps him win.
Okay, looks like I'll be looking for that one on Youtube.
Yes, it's there and it's a bit long, so don't try to watch it between comerical breaks or such.
