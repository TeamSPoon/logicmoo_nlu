Do you listen to the Beatles ever?
Yeah I listen to them regularly.
What is your favorite album by them?
I like Abbey Road a lot.
Which song?
Mean Mr. Mustard.
Wow I never heard someone say that before.
Yeah it is not their most famous song but I like it.
It is alright! I am not judging.
Thank you.
