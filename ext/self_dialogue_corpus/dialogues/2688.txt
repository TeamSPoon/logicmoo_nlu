Are you ready for some football?
I am sure, I'm excited for what is coming up.
Who do you think will get to the super bowl this year, besides the obvious in the Patriots.
I wouldn't be so sure about them. I think the Raiders may have a chance
Oh yeah, I keep forgetting about that debacle near the end of last year.
It's unfortunate we didn't get to see what Carr could do in the playoffs.
He's really turning into an amazing quarterback at such a young age.
The Raiders definitely struck gold on that kid.
Struck gold and are paying him in diamonds based on that contract they recently gave him.
That was a hefty one, but definitely worth it.
Given their history of bad quarterbacks since Gannon they definitely don't want to let him ever go.
He's definitely a raider for life as long as he stays healthy.
I do think they could be a contender. That defense looks like it could compliment that offense finally.
They definitely have improved on the defensive side.
It won't be easy to overthrow the Patriots though.
It never really is. They continue to be the number one team and it isn't even close.
It boggles my mind how they managed to become even better than their superbowl roster had.
It's scary how obnoxiously good the staff is from top to bottom. They always pick the right guys it seems.
It bothers me even more, because Brady looks like he is getting better with age.
I thought he was joking when he said he wants to play until he's 50, but honestly he's making me a believer year by year.
