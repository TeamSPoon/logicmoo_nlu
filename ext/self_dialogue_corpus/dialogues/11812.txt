So, you've heard of the Beatles, right.  What do you think of their best selling Album, Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band?
Oh, is that the one that was a concept album about a fictional band?
Yes, that is my all time favorite Beatles Album.
Oh, really.  Mine too. And my favorite track is "With a Little Help from my Friends".
My favorite track is "Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds".  What do you think of that song?
Yes, I like that one too.  But my all time favorite is "A day in the life".
Was that a Lennon and McCartney song?
Yes. In fact some claim that A Day in the Life was the best Lennon/McCartney collaboration.
I didn't I didn't know that. But  you know, there are so many excellent tracks on that album.
There sure are; and it's hard to believe that it was first released about 50 years ago.
