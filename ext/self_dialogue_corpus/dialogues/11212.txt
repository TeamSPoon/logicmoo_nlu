Isn't it funny how popular flannel is again?
Yeah, it's just like the 90s.
I owned something like 20 flannel shirts.
Wow!  I maybe had five.
Back then, it was all about grunge rock.
Yeah, grunge rockers in Seattle and their flannel shirts.
I think they just wore them because they were cheap.
I think so.  It's not clear why they're so popular now.
Maybe people are inspired by Duck Dynasty.
Ha!  I doubt it!
Maybe the fashion industry just started prompting the shirts themselves.
That would make sense.
You know what else was popular in the 90s?
What?
Baggy jeans.
That's the opposite of the way things are now.
Yeah, I can't believe the skinny jeans some people fit into.
I think they'd be really uncomforable.
Yeah, life is too short for skinny jeans.
Agreed.
