In Rouge One, they finally explained how they got the information on the Death Star.  What are your thoughts?
Horrible.  Absolutely horrible?
Why is that?
Think about it...  One guy designs a flaw so large and NO ONE notices?
Well, he didnt make it obvious, remember?
So what?  There were like 1000 engineers working on that thing and no one noticed?
I guess not...
Yeah, completely unbelievable!
You do know its just a movie right?
So what, they need to get their stuff straight!
