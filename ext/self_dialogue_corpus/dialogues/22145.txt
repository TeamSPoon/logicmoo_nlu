I want to watch some movie tonight
What sort of movie are you in the mood for?
I want something cheeky but also scary
Well their is something out their like that
But i am having some troubles choosing
Well how cheeky do you want it
Well i want it to be a little scary not to far off in the realm of humor
Well is something cheesy to your liking?
I think something cheesy would be to my liking i would guess
Does it matter how old the movie is ?
Nah i really got no hang ups about it being new or older
Well i got an idea for a movie for you then
Well then out with it?
How about scream it is a good movie
Hmm that might work it is scary but it is also a little cheesy
Seems like it would be right up your alley and i would really say give it a go
Is it a singe movie or based on a series
Their is more than one movie but they can be watched stand alone
I only saw a little bit a long time ago who directed it
It was directed by wes craven.
