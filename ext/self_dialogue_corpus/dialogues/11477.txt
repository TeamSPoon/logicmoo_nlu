Who were the original members of the Beatles?
The original band members were John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, Stuart Sutcliffe, and Pete Best.
When did Ringo Starr join the band?
Ringo replaced Pete Best as drummer in 1962.
Oh, that's interesting. And when did Stuart Sutcliffe leave?
He left a few months before Pete Best because he decided to return to university.
That's interesting. You never really hear about the other two in the band before Ringo.
Yeah, none of their really big hit songs were made during that time so maybe that's why.
That makes sense. Either way, I'm glad they ended up with the members they did.
Me too. Those four were all very talented.
