What kind of music do you like?
I'm up for almost any, but no rap or country.
OK, have you heard of Airborne Toxic Event?
No, what kind of music do they play?
I would classify it as alt rock.
Do they have any songs out.
They are kind of an indy band, I've only heard one song of theirs on the radio.
And it is???
It is called Sometime Around Midnight. It is an amazing song.
What makes it so amazing.
Well it tells a story.
What kind of story.
A story of seeing an old lover one night.
Sounds good.
Man it is so good, you can feel the emotion from the song.
I'll have to check it out.
Yeah, you should see the performance they did on Letterman.
They were on Letterman?
Yeah a few times.
So they have a few songs out then.
