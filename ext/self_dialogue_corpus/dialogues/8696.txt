So, Elvis, was he overrated?
Maybe in the '50s, sure, because he was a white guy doing what black artists did.
But not today?
No, I think we tend to forget about Elvis' impact today.
For me, it's another of those historical examples that tells us a lot about Fifties culture.
Sure, like, Elvis was the crack in the dam of sexual repression... he represented something bold and exciting.
And frightening to people, yet they wanted to see more.
And like Hollywood at the time, Elvis' story is this amazing self-invention in pop culture's own image.
Yeah, right down to dying his hair black to look like his favorite comic book character.
That's probably the main reason you always see Elvis and Marilyn Monroe paired off in images of the '50s.
