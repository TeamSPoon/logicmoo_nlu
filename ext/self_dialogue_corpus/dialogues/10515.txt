Hey man!
Sup buddy?
Not much.
Like this weather?
Oh, yeah!
Summer is coming on!
What you up to?
Was thinking about going to the concert tonight.
Yeah?
Who's playing.
The Dirty Heads.
Never heard of them.
They're kind of a ska band.
Ska?
It's like reggae?
Oh....
Kind of like Sublime.
I love that band!
You should come along.
Sounds fun.
