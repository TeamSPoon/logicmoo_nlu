One of my favorite comedies.  Super Troopers.
Oh man that's such a good college drinking movie.
I know.  Still funny as an adult though.
It was well done.
I still say to people.  I want a liter of cola.
Ha, that whole movie was all good one liners.
At least every minute or so.
Like "who wants a mustache ride"
Oh man that cracked me up.  How about "littering and, littering and"
Yes.  and at the start "you boys like Mexico?"
Just one after another.  Good delivery too.
Yeah, like the meow gag.
Another good one was the repeater.
I love the repeater.
That was a good one right there.
I love when they were drinking the syrup.
Yeah, that was gross but good.
Or when they arrested Farva and covered him in powdered sugar.
Oh man I forgot about that.
Just a classic comedy.
