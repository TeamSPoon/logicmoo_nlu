So have you heard about the devil's blood?
what is devil's blood?
you don't know what devil's blood is?
I just have no idea.
It's a very famous rock band from netherlands.
Oh, I never heard of them.
Trust me, they are very famous.
I guess they are not that famous here in america.
I would say a lot of americans know about them.
Then maybe they are not very famous in my neighborhood.
