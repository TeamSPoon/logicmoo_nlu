How do you feel about the Faithful?
Do you mean the San Francisco 49ers?
Yep.
I am mostly disappointed with them since Jim Harbaugh left.
He is a great coach.
The biggest mistake the 49ers ever made was letting him go.
I hear that he just couldn't get along with the owner, Jeb.
Instead of being successful at the collegiate level, he could still be leading the 49ers to victory.
What do you think about Colin Kaepernick?
I think Jim is the only person who could bring out his full potential.
Do you think he will ever work in the NFL again?
It's hard to say with all the controversy surrounding him.
Changing his stance on the National Anthem thing made him look flakely.
He has decided to stand now to would increase his chances of getting hired.
I am all for him standing up for what he believes in; he just needs to be consistent.
I agree with you on that.
Do you think Tom Brady is greater than Joe Montana?
I think Tom Brady is finally edging Joe out of the top spot.
They are both great quarterbacks.
I hope the 49ers get a great one soon to help them back to the championship again.
