I just saw the best animated movie ever!
Cool, which one.
I just got thru watching ' Frozen'. Have  you seen it yet.
Yes, seems like 100 times, my daughter loves it. Her favorite character is Olaf.
He is funny, mine is Anna.  Whoever does the voice can sing.
Did you know the song "let it go" was written before they ever made the movie?
No, I didn't know that!
Its true, they maade the movie around that one song.
I like that it was the first Disney movie to not have a Prince to save a Princess .
