Because, what do the running backs do?
Um, they rush.
Yes, do you need a lot of intelligence to hold on to the ball tight and run?
That's not what running backs do.
That's exactly what running backs do
No it's not. Running back to have to assess spatial relations between themselves and the defensive line, and the safeties too, That takes a lot of thinking
Ok, then how was Frank Gore such a great rusher?
For crying outloud. Maybe he blew off the test too. Besides, RBs score about 16. We're not talking about a 4 here.
Oh wait, so 10 is being barely literate.
20 is average, so 16 is... below... average.
Hahaha. I was right. This test sucks.
No it doesn't. Anything that provides a quatifiable information doesn't suck
Quantify this
That's just so mature. Seriously. By taking the assessing the mental dimensions, you can improve the game a lot.
Yes I get that. But why publish all this though?
Why publish their combine data? It's just all data.
But it's embarassing.
There is nothing embarassing about your Wonderlic score if you're in the NFL making millions.
Huh. Yeah, give me 40 million and a brain that's only capable of scoring a 10.
Yeah, no, you wouldn't be happy with that.
