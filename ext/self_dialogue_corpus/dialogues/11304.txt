I've been listening to the old Beatles songs recently.
Who listens to them anymore?
They influenced the development of rock and roll.
What songs did that?
Their first break through hit was Love Me Do.
I remember that one.
It was written by John Lennon and Paul McCartney
Who sang it?
Usually the Beatle that did the most composing on the song, sang the lead.  So John Lennon sang this one
I always liked his voice.
