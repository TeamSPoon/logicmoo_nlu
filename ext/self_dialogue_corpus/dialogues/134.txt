I saw Wonder Woman the other day.
How was it?
It was good.  A bit slow in the beginning.
Did you like Gal Gadot?
Yes, she was very pretty and likeable.
I was worried when they cast her because she is so skinny.
She looked great and was a good actress.
Does she get involved with Chris Pines character?
Yes, they fall in love.
I should see it.
