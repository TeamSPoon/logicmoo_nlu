I think I have a great band for you to listen to.
Oh, which one is that?
Their album is pretty new. They are called Cloud Nothings.
Nice, tell me about them.
Well, they are an Indie Genre, that's why I'm mentioning them to you.
I do love the indie genre!
So, yeah. They are definitely worth trying out.
What is one of their songs called?
I mentioned that they have a new album. It's their 4th actually. The song I like on it is called Sight unseen.
What is the album called?
It's called Light Without Sound.
I think I will look that up on spotify later.
Yeah, I highly recommend it! You should listen to the whole album. It's a blast.
I believe you, you never led me astray before.
They are actually coming to Washington in July, In King County, just a few hours drive from here.
Are you going to see them?
Of course! I'm so excited. My boyfriend is getting the tickets next week.
I'll check them out and if I like them maybe I'll buy a ticket too. I love concerts.
Oh, you will love them. I'm sure of it.
Thanks for the heads up!
