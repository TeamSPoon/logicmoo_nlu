Ready for the final Planet of the Apes film?
God, yes. Andy Serkis is amazing.
Yeah, and the direction and action have been great.
There's one thing I"m not sure about.
What's that?
Woody Harrelson, with a shaved head, as a military commander.
Yeah, that was a bit odd, but he can make it work.
Do you think they'll pull a twist and have the humans win?
That would be pretty interesting as a swerve, but the human population is dying off.
Yeah, they wouldn't support themselves.
