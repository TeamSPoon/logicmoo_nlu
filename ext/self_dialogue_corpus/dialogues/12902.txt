Do you think the new Han Solo movie will be good?
I sure hope so! Han is my favorite Star Wars character.
It will definitely be weird to see Han as someone other than Harrison Ford
I know. The two are practically the same in my mind.
Alden Ehrenreich seems to be good though.
I watched some of his movies after he was announced as the actor. He definitely has talent.
I'm worried about the chaos with the director job lately.
I heard they just found someone to head the project. Ron Howard.
Oh, he's good! I loved Apollo 13.
With any luck, he'll have things back on track soon.
