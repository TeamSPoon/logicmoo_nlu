Did you see Star Wars: The Force Awakens?
Yes, I thought that movie was so cool.
I did too. It might even be my favorite Star Wars film.
I loved that they decided to use real sets and costumes.
I agree. It felt like a tribute to the original films.
They did a great job with character development, too.
Definitely. I already care about all of the characters they introduced.
I'm hoping they explore Rey's control of the force more in the next film.
I'm sure they will. Her character is so mysterious and interesting.
A lot of people are saying that she could be a Skywalker. I can't wait to find out.
