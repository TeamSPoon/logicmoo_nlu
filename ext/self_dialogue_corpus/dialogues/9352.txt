Remember that one song "Work It" from the early 2000s?
I do but I'm having a hard time placing the artist, do you know?
It was by Missy Elliot.
Right I loved her music.
Right? All of her music videos were so cool.
She was very original.
I thought it was cute how she had kids dancing in her videos.
Yes, one little girl was in quite a few of them.
I think I know who you mean. I don't remember her name.
Me either but she was Caucasian and a great dancer.
