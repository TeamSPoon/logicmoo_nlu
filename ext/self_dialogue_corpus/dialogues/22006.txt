Do you think we will get to see any new horro movies for Halloween this year?
Oh, probably but I certainly won't be watching them?
Why not?
I absolutely hate horror movies. I don't think I've ever watched one all the way through.
Not even one?
Not that I can think of. I hate being scared!
I can't believe you've never even seen the classics like Friday the 13th or Nightmare on Elm Street.
No way. And I have no desire to.
What about thrillers?
If they are more psychological, then yes I'll watch them. But anything that can be called a "slasher" movie. No way!
Well, then have you seen Paranormal Activity?
Parts of it. I should have added demons and hauntings to the list of movies I don't like.
That's crazy. What do you watch at Halloween?!
Oh, you know. Halloweentown, Hocus Pocus, Nightmare Before Christmas.
So kids movies?
That's what I prefer in the Halloween genre!
I love a good scare. I still haven't found one yet that really gets me scared.
To put it in perspective for you, I jumped during Zooptopia.
The animated kids movie?
Yes, that would be the one.
