Have you seen the new Star Wars Movie?
Yeah I thought it was great!
Yeah it gave a lot of information about what happens between the third and fourth movie.
Yeah I always wondered how they randomly got the entire plans for the death star.
Isn't it leaps and bounds better in terms of cgi and production value?
Yeah it looks way better than the first ones that came out in the 70's and 80's.
I feel like the new ones kind of stray away form the original ones though in terms of storytelling.
Yeah that's a consequence of Lucas films being sold to Disney. It's meant to appeal to a wider audience.
Did you like the one before it?
No, I thought the story telling is bad and I hated the director JJ Abrams.
You thought he messed up the movie?
Yeah he was too nostalgic and it was kinda cheesy.
Oh RIP I really liked it.
Yeah I wasn't a big fan.
Oh well at least they have a multiple movie deal and there's more to come out.
Yeah I'm really looking forward to those.
Do you know what direction their heading in now?
Yeah I think it's supposed to be about the fall of the empire and we figure out who the new Jedi's are.
Looking forward to it!
We should watch it together.
