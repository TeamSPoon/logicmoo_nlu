Which Star Wars film trilogy do you like best?
That's a hard one. The trilogy with Anakin Skywalker's backstory had such great computer animation.
Agreed.  So you like them both equally?
No really I prefer the first trilogy that started in the 70's.
Unh hunh, what do you like about it?
The basic story.  Lucas created a mythic tale, no fuss.
Yea I heard he drew from different archetypes.
Right, so the basic stories to me, were front and center.
They weren't hard to understand or follow.
It was just his dialogue they say needed polishing.
