What is going on here?
Well, it seems that the Rams are getting their asses kicked by the Broncos!
Well, darn it! I thought they were gonna do better than that!
Not with Peyton Manning as their Quarterback.
Who's your favorite team to win this year's season?
Maybe the Colts?
Nahhh, they don't got anyone.
The Buccaneers might have a chance!
Do they now?
I don't see why not!
I agree, they used to be really bad, until their most recent QB came in!
Who else are we talking about?
Not sure, don't have anyone in mind.
What about the Dolphins?
The Dolphins are okay.
Yeah, that's right!
But they don't stand a chance against the Packers.
No, they don't.
What about the Jaguars?
Not so sure about them, not after Jessica Namath slayed them in her fox fur jacket!
