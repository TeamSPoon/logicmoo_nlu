I think John Williams is one of the best composers who is alive today.
What kind of music does he write?
He's done a lot of movie theme songs.
What are some of them?
Harry Potter, Star Wars, Indiana Jones and Jurassic Park.
He did all of those?
Yes and a lot more.
Did he do the Pirates of the Caribbean movies?
No, that was someone else.
What are more of his songs?
He's also written the Superman theme, ET, and Jaws.
Oh that Jaws song is so foreboding.
I know.You hear it and you know the shark is coming.
So do you have a favorite song by him?
It's a toss up between the Harry Potter theme song and the theme song from Jurassic Park.
From the songs you've told me about, I think that the theme song from Indiana Jones is my favorite.
That's a pretty exciting song.
Has he won any awards for his music?
A lot. He;s won Academy Awards, Grammy Awards and Golden Globes.
He seems like a really incredible composer.
