Have you seen "Ouija: Origin of Evil"? I watched it last night.
Sure have. Before I say anything, what did you think?
Honestly, I thought it was really so-so. I kept waiting for something to happen, it does in a 15 minute span, and then oh look, everyone is dead.
Yes, thank you! Everyone I know loved it.
I was really surprised, so many people recommended it to me!
Me too! It felt like the spooky moments really dominated the plot rather than the other way around.
And I really wasn't buying the plot line. A lot of innocent people died in this house in a terrible way, so their ghosts decided to kill a family?
Right, it seemed like an afterthought. It was like they wrote the movie and went, "oh man, so why are the ghosts doing this again?"
Also, I think they were trying to take borrow that religious turmoil vibe from "The Exorcist" with their own priest questioning his faith.
I think in the movie business they call that an homage so they can skirt being accused of unoriginality.
