So, do you think Scarface is an action movie? Or is it crime?
It's definitely an action movie, at least in the Al Pacino version. That's the only one I've seen.
Me too. But isn't crime a different category?
There's different kinds of crime movies. Like Godfather III is actually sort of an opera, and sort of a love story too.
Really? I never saw it. Is it good?
Yeah, kind of. But Scarface is an action movie because of all the violent action. You have to have violence in an action movie, I think.
Or you could call it a romance, because of Michelle Pfeiffer. What a massively unhappy marriage.
Yeah, she was great as Elvira--and there was another woman too, Mary Elizabeth Matroantonio. But it was Pacino's film.
Yeah. His work made the whole corrupt rags-to-riches story seem almost heroic.
Yeah, almost. You still knew he was just a drug dealer, who would die in the end.
