Then it is a perfect ending for John Wick to annihilate the High Table. It's a poetic justice.
Yes, but hard to make another sequel once Wick does that. Wick can destroy the High Table's most evil and sinister character who wants him dead.
But keep the others around, just in case, he wants to go back to work...
No, not go back to work for the High Table, but leave room for simmering discontent between them.
The type of discontent that can boil over with a slightest malcontent and misdeeds. From either side.
Precisely. Now you can make a 4th sequel.
Not sure if I want to see 4th sequel of John Wick.
Why not? What if the 3rd sequel is as good as the 2nd?
Well. the premise has to change somewhat, but this is just one oorup of adversaries against the single assassin.
Well, he did leave the Russian mob boss alive in the 2nd movie. So in the 4th one, who knows, maybe the High table and Russiam mob joins hands.
And get destroyed by Wick again! That I will see!
And this time around, he leaves NO ONE alive. Not even their dogs, nor their cats.
Kill 'em ALL!.
Yep.
Sigh, that will be so good.
Yep.
You know what will be better?
What?
If John Wick finds another love interest in the 4th movie, and then Russian Mob kills her in cooperation with the High Table,, and that becomes the reason for John Wick ultimate rage, and murderous rampage. he's going to kill them all this time. And this time he means it.
Eh. Too typical. We would expect a rage for something like that. And it's not very believable that Russian Mob will do something so stupid, unless they have no choice. i don't know we'll see what happens in the 3rd movie. Let's go watch the chapter 2 again.
