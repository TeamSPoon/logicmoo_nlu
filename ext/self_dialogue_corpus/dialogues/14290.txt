Have you seen the Arizona Diamondbacks this year?
Yes, I watched yesterday in San Diego.  What do you think of the catcher who got hit by a pitch a few weeks back?
It was pretty amazing that he came back and hit a home run in his first game.
I agree, it was pretty phenomenal.  Do you think the pitcher hit him on purpose?
I believe these guys are professionals and have great control but in the same sense they are human.
Yes, humans make errors but something in my gut says it was on purpose.
I too feel it was intentional even though he says it was an accident.
How do you feel the Diamondbacks are doing this season?
I like their chances this year to at least make the playoffs.
Me too, they are playing some pretty good ball and as long as they keep playing as a team, they will be fine
How about the Baltimore Orioles in the American league.  What do you think about how they are playing?
The Orioles are definitely turning some heads this season.  I am not sure they can keep it up at their current pace.
I have to agree, they have definitely played well at the beginning of the season with the second best record in all of baseball.
Yes, and they have one of the hardest rivals in all of baseball.  They have to play the NY Yankees and even if the Yankees record sucks, they will always play the Orioles hard.
Pretty crazy how baseball teams have rivals that always play each other hard.
Yes, both the Orioles and the Red Sox are big time rivals with the Yankees. Who was your all time favorite Yankee?
You know, I don't have to go back that far to say Derek Jieter.  Who is your all time favorite baseball player?
I would have to say Cal Ripkin because I grew up watching him play for the Orioles.  Man could that boy play some ball.
I really enjoyed watching Ripkin play but I truly loved when Earl Weaver was their coach.
Oh yes, he could cover up home plate better then any other coach in the majors.  He was iconic.
