Did you see the film The Sixth Sense?
Yes. It is one of my favorite films.
What did you like about it?
First it was a different kind of role for Bruce Willis.
What was different about it?
He normally is an action star.  In this one all he did was talk.
Did you enjoy his acting?
He was understated in the role compared to being overstated and loud so I did like that.
What else did you like?
I think the kid did a great acting job.
I agree.  Haley Joel Osment will have a great acting career.
The story seemed to start out as a love story.
It sure did.  The tone changed however and I did not know what to expect.
Yes.  I thought they would end up being a problem solving team for dead people.
Well, there was one round of that.
Yes.  The mother killed her daughter and was exposed by the team.
That was satisfying.  It was early enough in the film that I expected an even bigger case.
There was sure a twist that did not go in that direction.
I know.  I was completely fooled.  I loved it!
So did I.  So many movies are predictable, but not that one.
