You like Hitchcock?
That PSYCHO? He's for THE BIRDS -- snooping around, peering into a neighbor''s REAR WINDOW.
Hey, don't get in a FRENZY.
Hey, you've got THE WRONG MAN! I'm not agitated -- it's just that his movies give me VERTIGO
I guess one could say he is NOTORIOUS.
What's that old saying, give a man enough ROPE...
Ah yes -- ROPE -- the master's most underrated movie.
It WAS a little weird, those two guys hiding the murdered corpse at a family dinner party.
The lead, John Dall, was scary good -- maybe TOO good, because his career never took off, and not for lack of talent.
And Jimmy Stewart playing an existential philosophy professor with a Nietzschean fixation.
It was a murder mystery where the murder took place at in the first few minutes of the film.
Right, very unconventional, especially in context of its 1948 release.
There was no question the weapon, who did it, or where the body was.
I must say, I enjoyed how Hitchcock would ratchet up the suspense.
The philosophy angle might have been a little weak
I never bought Stewart's 180 degree come-to-Jesus moment in the end.
Yes, way too tidy, but the Hays Code intervened.
That's what it felt like.
Which is why I love the pre-code era from 1930 to 1934.
Some real gems -- but some pretty gratuitously tawdry junk, too.
