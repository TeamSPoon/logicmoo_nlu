What are you up to this weekend?
Not much, probably Netflix binging.
That;s my usual too!
Why do you ask?
I know there's a music festival downtown this weekend, and I was thinking of going.
Oh, yeah! I wish I could. I'm sure tickets are sold out though.
They are, but I'm working at it so I have free passes!
Are you kidding me!?
No! Come with me to see Modest Mouse live!
That would be amazing. They've been one of my favorite bands since middle school. Who else is playing?
I know alt-J is.
Another fave! Totally in!
Good, cause I don't remember any of the other performers.
That's funny!
The lineup is supposed to be good.
Yeah, I've heard ads on the radio and remember it sounding good.
I love all alternative music.
Me too! I'm so looking forward to it, and I'm so glad I have someone to go with me.
Yeah, it'll be a great weekend.
Sounds great, let's meet Friday at 12.
