I just finished watching Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire!
What did you think of it? That's one of my favorite movies in the whole series!
I liked it a lot. But it got pretty dark, especially towards the end when Harry comes out with Cedric's body.
It does get dark. It has some funny parts though too!
Which parts are you thinking of?
When Fred and George try to put their names in the cup and get cursed with beards, and then when Dumbledore corners Harry after his name gets pulled.
That is funny. He storms at Harry and yells "DID YOU PUT YOUR NAME INTO THE GOBLET OF FIRE!" even though in the book it says he calmly asks him.
It's so crazy too how the real Professor Moony was hidden at the bottom of a huge trunk the entire time.
That is really crazy. If you could take Polyjuice Potion to turn into any character, who would it be?
Probably Professor McGonnagall. She's whip smart and is one of my favorite characters in the series.
