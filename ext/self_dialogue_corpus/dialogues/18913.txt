Do you like any music from the 90's?
I like tons of music from the 90's.  I grew up in the 90's.
Name one of your favorite bands.
Nirvana would have to be at the top of the list. What about you?
I would have to say The Counting Crows top my list.
That's a good one. There was so much good music then.
Yes there was, Aerosmith made some great stuff in the 90's, for sure.
I had the hits album "Big Ones", I used to listen to it over and over.
I had that one too.  I have to say though, I do not miss having CD's all over the place.
Me either. I was really in to my music then so I had towers of CD's everywhere.
That's funny.  Did you ever listen to ICP?
ICP? I don't thinbk I have heard of that one.
They are not as well known, they make some unique music. It is funny, disgusting and completely offensive.
Oh, so they are kind of like 2 Live Crew?
I guess so. Well, they are both pretty offensive anyway.
I remember listening to "Dirty Nursery Rhymes" and my Dad hearing it and taking my CD player away for a week.
That's funny. I never listened to ICP at home because I was afraid that same thing would happen to me.
I can't believe I forgot to mention my all time favorite that is from the 90's, Sublime.
Wow, I'm surprised I didn't think of that one. I loved the album Stand By Your Van.
Me too! Those were some good times.
