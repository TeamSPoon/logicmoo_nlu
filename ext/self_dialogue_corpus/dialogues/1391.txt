So Ryan Tannenhill is returning for another season for Miami.
So i see, looks like he's got some  good 2nd and 3rd string players as well.
Who are they?
Well, there is Matt More.
Oh yeah, he covered Tannenhill a lot last season.
I remember, Then there is David Fales.
He's new, right?
I think so.
Brandon Dourghty is trying to make a play for third string.
Is he any good?
I don't know, i never heard of him.
hm.
Well, if they let Moore play even more this season i think getting to the playoffs won't be a problem.
I know. They got there last season but was shut down early.
I remember. I was bummed out after seeing Jacksonville and Tampa not making it.
Yes, it's hard for Florida teams to make it to the playoffs and hold it.
Hopefully it will be different this year.
Well, i dont see Jacksonville making the grade.
Yeah, hoping Miami makes it to the playoffs again this season
Me too!
