Everyone loves Lady Gaga! What's your favorite song by her?
I really like her very first hit, 'Just Dance.'
That song never gets old!
Confession! I still listen to it this day.
I really like 'Born This Way' because it speaks so much truth.
I agree, the lyrics there are pretty deep.
Did you know she has a collaboration with Tony Bennett?
Really? What's it called?
She has a whole jazz album and it's different but I love 'Cheek to cheek.'
I'll need to look that up on Youtube! Thanks for sharing.
