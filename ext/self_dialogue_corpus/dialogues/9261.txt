What rock bands do you like?
I loved the Stones, lots of classic hits.
Hard to believe they are still touring and playing.  Still have a lot of appeal of the songs from their glory days.  Like Ruby Tuesday for instance.
I loved to listen to them on my 8 tracks.  I had one in the garage run by a battery charger and one in my car.  Listened to the stones, Eric Clapton and some Elvis.
I liked Neil Diamond too, sweet Caroline among others.
We used to ride around in the car and listen to 8 tracks like "Paint It Black" or Tommy from "The Who".
Sure it was easy to ride around, gas was cheap and you could listen to your trade a tape like Neil Diamond or the latest artists.
The care free days were so cool, it seemed like the hits would keep coming but so many of the bands broke up like the Beatles.
And they moved on to other things, formed independants and struck off on their own like happened to the Byrds.
Sure, they had a song "eight miles high" that was supposed to be about flying but everyone thought was about drugs.
