Why so glum?
Glum? I'm not glum.
Your look forelorn.
This is my pokerface.
Who are you? Lady Gaga?
Not quite. And I'm wearing a polyester leisure suit...not a feather boa with sequins..
That look could work for you.
Thanks, but I don't have her pipes.
Let me hear your best Lady Gaga singing.
I make it a point to only sing Gaga in the bathroom. 'm trying to avoid the darker side of fame.
