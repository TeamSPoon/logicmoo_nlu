Are you a fan of auto-tune?
Here we go.  Heck yes I am.
Oh my.  Why would you like such an overused thing?
Think about it.  It's a tool that perfects human singing, one of the most impactful sounds a human can hear.
Well, I like it when it first started.
Don't get auto-tune and vocoders confused.  Both are used all of the time in pop music.
Oh I love vocoders.  The harmonies are quite sweet.
Yeah, pop stars Roger and Zapp crushed the vocoder scene in the eighties.
Now everyone from Madonna to Daft Punk have used vocoder technology.
And auto-tune sounds like vocoders, so that's why I love it.
