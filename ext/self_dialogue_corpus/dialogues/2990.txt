Will Elliot rush for 2000 yards this year?
It very much is in realm of possibility for him.
I think he could eclipse it with ease.
That would mean Dak doesnt have to throw it often enough.
Yeah and I think thats the plan for the Cowboys
The problem is their defense
You think it could be bad?
Yeah I mean their secondary is in shambles.
But their offense keeps them off the field
Right but if they get into shootouts I am not sure if they can keep up
Maybe teams run on them to kill the clock as well.
I think they need to be aggressive in rushing Prescott
He seems to work well under pressure
The numbers say if he gets flushed out it could be lights out
Could you imagine if he has a bad year?
They probably would regret getting Romo out of there.
He could always still come back
I am sure CBS prevented that from happening.
How so?
They probably bonused him alot of cash and he would have to pay it back
