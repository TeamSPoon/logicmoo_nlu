You think the Nationals will keep Harper?
I dont know. I dont see why they wouldnt.
They havent approached him about an extension.
Probably gonna cost a half a billion.
They print money in baseball.
Yeah but thats alot of money.
Its the way salaries are going.
We all thought A-Rod's was insane.
Trout might top Harper's.
Nah, Harper will get the most.
I dont think so. Trout has had a better career.
Yeah true but hes always had good protection.
Well the Nats trot out some sluggers.
Daniel Murphy isnt Albert Pujols.
Pujols is a shell of himself.
Yeah Angels probably regret that decision.
Who wouldnt?
Yankees. They can pay anyone.
Thats where Harper goes I bet.
Doesnt anyone want to unseat them? Its not fair.
