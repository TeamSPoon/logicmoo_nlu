When does the regular season end?
I believe April 12th.
Would you take Jordan or Russell?
In todays game, Jordan...40 years ago Russell.
Did you have fun at all-star weekend?
Oh yeah, New Orleans should host it every year.
When is the draft?
June 22, 2017
Do you think the Lakers will ever pass the Celtics with the most titles?
Yes and no, currently no- but if LA can put a great team together again like they did with Kobe and Shaq, they have a chance.
Do you think Lebron will eventually pass Abdul-Jabbar?
Oh yeah, you figure he can hang around for another 8-10 years. He will pass him easily.
What do you think are two things that SHOULD be considered when picking the MVP?
Individual excellence, a simple “best player.” And Most impactful.
Do you think team success should play a bigger part?
Definitely, without it then the season doesn't mean anything. Put Lebron on the Knicks and he will average 50+ points a game.
What is the "system" in Cleveland compared to the Spurs.
Lebron IS the system in Cleveland.
Should WHO their teammates are play a part?
Yes and no, this goes back to the arguement of a great player on a bad team.
