Are you pissed about the Olympics?
What happened?
Bettman said no to the players going over from the NHL
He cant do that, theyll just leave.
Right, but I dont think its going to be that easy.
Why do you say that?
Owners can write it into contracts.
I am not sure thats true.
You may be right, but until the NHL can profit off of it, they wont.
The profit is in the exposure.
True but NBC does not know how to market the game to a base of people.
Outside of Chicago, LA, or New York people dont even watch the finals.
Well that has as much to do with NBCs marketing team as it does the NHL. What do they do?
Try to get out of the deal and go to ESPN.
Now that would boost ratings.
It definitely would but ESPN might not have the money.
Well they cant build the game with NBC
They need the Olympic exposure.
Ovi said hes going over.
He should stay there while hes at it.
