Are there any rumors yet about 'Fast 9?'
There are a few details.  For instance, Vin Diesel and The Rock are set to reprise their roles.
That's cool, but I'm actually surprised.
How so?
Didn't they not get along during the shooting of the movie?
I did hear something like that.  Apparently they had a feud but were cordial to each other on set.
I suppose as long as you can work with the person, it's fine.  What was the feud even about?
There was a rumor that it was about who would have the bigger role.  The Rock apparently conceded.
So there was a chance that 'Fate of the Furious' could have been about Hobbs, The Rock's character, going bad instead.
That would have been just as fun to watch.  And as a former cop, Hobbs would have been more interesting.
