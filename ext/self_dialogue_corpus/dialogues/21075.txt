Mom  I just saw Mandy run past me crying. Is she okay?
Your sister is fine, Mark.
But...
She just watched the Titanic with me and you know how it affects her.
i will never understand how that movie can make anyone cry.
For one thing, you are a boy, Tommy.
What's the other thing?
Your sister is very emotional. Sad love stories make her cry.
But she knew it would make her cry. So...
Why did she watch it?
Yeah.
You are too young to understand, Tommy.
She's crying over some fictional character that  dies in a movie and I am the one who doesn't understand?
Tommy, The Titanic is  action-packed romance set against the ill-fated maiden voyage of the R.M.S.
I know mom. I saw it when it first came out.
One day you will understand, Tommy.
God, I hope not. I think girls are weird.
Why?
Crying over a movie about at ship that sank a long time ago makes girls weird.
Oh, Tommy.
