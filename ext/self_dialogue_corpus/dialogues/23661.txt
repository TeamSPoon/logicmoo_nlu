The King and I, ever seen it?
With Yule Brenner?
Yes, that one.
Years ago as a kid I have. Did it hold up as an adult.
It was better as an adult. I forgotten how good he is in it.
He does a really good king.
He does all his parts well. Ever seen him in other movies?
A few. Anastasia.
That was a beautiful film. The whole thing just so pretty.
I know. He does the sort of good but not so good guy well.
I love movies with complicated characters.
I think Tarzan in the new movie was one.
Really? He seemed pretty straight forward to me.
That was part of the movie. Tarzan seemed one way, but was a whole other person too.
Maybe. Nothing like the movie George of The Jungle.
With Brendad Frasier.
Yep.He was very plain as far as the movie went, in plot.
It was a funny one, just a sill Tarzan story.
I like some of his other movies. Like The Mummy.
They are remaking them. Why, I do not know.
