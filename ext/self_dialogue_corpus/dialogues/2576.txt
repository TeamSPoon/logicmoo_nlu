Who do you think are the greatest NFL defensive players ever?
Well Reggie White is great.
Yes, I agree. Any others you want to list?
Well I think that Deion Sanders and Ed Reed are up there.
They definitely dominated their respective positions.
What do you think about Dick Butkus?
I was too young, but I heard he is phenomenal.
I think his name is hilarious.
Me too, but he could hit very very hard I hear!
This is probably true. The dude is a hall of famer.
Who are current players that will be in the hall of fame?
Defense or offensive players?
Start with defense.
Well JJ Watt is up there, and I think that Patrick Peterson will someday be up there, too.
What about offensive players?
Well obviously Brady.
Any more?
I think that Larry Fitgerald and AJ Green will eventually be there.
Any running backs?
Well, I think that Marshawn Lynch has a very good shot.
