Have you ever listened to City and Colour?
Yes, I love his music.
I just found out about him yesterday. It's so good.
It really is. Dallas Green's voice is one of a kind.
I agree. I have never heard anything like it.
It's not just his voice. His songwriting is incredible, too.
I listened to "Casey's song" the other day and I was blown away.
That's one of my favorites. Even though it's like 12 years old.
Are there any other really good songs I should check out from him?
I personally like "Comin' Home" a lot.
I'm so eager to hear more from him.
He used to be in a Screamo band a long time ago.
Really? What was their name.
It was called Alexisonfire. Their music is really cool too.
Was he doing the screaming?
No, he just did the clean singing and played guitar. They had another vocalist.
That's awesome. What was their latest album?
They released some newer albums but the good stuff is the old music.
Which album would you recommend?
Their self-titled is really good and so is "Watch Out". Anything after that I'm not familiar with.
