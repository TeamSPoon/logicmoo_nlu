Are you familiar with Korean films?
Not really.  I am totally unfamiliar with them.
You should check out the movie, 'Old Boy.'
What is it about?
It's about a man who is locked up in a hotel room-jail cell for 15 years without knowing why he was there.
The whole movie takes place there?
No, he gets out after 15 years.  The rest of the movie is him trying to find out what happens, and also get revenge.
I want to look this movie up.  What is the name of the director?
The director's name is Park Chan-wook.  Also, there was an American remake of the movie in 2013.
I will have to see both of them.
