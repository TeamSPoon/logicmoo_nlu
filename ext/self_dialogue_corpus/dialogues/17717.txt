I'm going to a concert tonight!
Awesome! Who's playing?
The headliner is John Legend.
Aw, that's really cool. John Legend is amazing.
I've been a fan of his music since he did an album with Kanye West back in the mid 2000s.
I remember that album. It was a mix of hip hop and R & B, right?
Yep. At the time I was a big hip hop fan.
So the album was kind of like a nice transition into R&B?
Yeah, I think that's accurate to say.
Who else is going to be playing at the concert.
I'm not sure about a lot of the opener acts. I think Robin Thicke is performing.
Hmm, I'm not a big a fan of his.
Why not?
If you listen to his music, it's clear that he's basically ripping off Marvin Gaye.
Really? I never noticed that.
It's pretty blatant once you start listening for it.
Now I'll probably be able to think about nothing else. Haha.
It bugs me because Marvin Gaye is one of my all time favorites.
But wouldn't that make you like Robin Thicke, if he sounds like Marvin Gaye?
It feels like he's stealing from Marvin Gaye, which makes me mad.
