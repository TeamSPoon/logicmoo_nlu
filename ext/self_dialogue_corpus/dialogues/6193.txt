Alice in Wonderland was such a strange movie.
I agree, especially since it came out so long ago.
That caterpillar was just insane.
Yeah, he really got mad at Alice at one point.
There were so many parts in that movie that scared me.
That queen and the Mad Hatter were pretty terrifying.
Didn't the whole movie end up being a dream in the end though?
I think so, but I haven't seen it in so long I can't remember.
We should watch it again soon to see if it's still scary.
Okay, but don't blame me if you can't sleep that night!
