I just saw a commercial for a captain underpants movie.
Oh really? I didn't know they were making one.
Ya, my daughter is super excited. She loves the books.
Ya I know the premise of them.
I bet it will be a really silly movie.
Of course! How could it be not?
I know, but I hope it has some substance to it.
I don't know about substance, but I am sure it is funny.
I can only imagine the jokes.
Is it an animated movie?
Yes, I am pretty sure it is.
I wonder if any big stars are in it?
I have no idea, I'll have to look it up.
Either way I am sure the kids will love it.
I now my children will.
Is it already out in the theaters?
No,  not yet. I think next weekend.
Well, I guess I know what I'll be doing next weekend.
Ya, I guess I do too.
Well, enjoy it!
