I have a confession to make.
What's on your mind?
My absolute favorite thing about the Star Wars films are the machines.
You mean like the robots?
Pretty much, yeah. I love the AT AT walkers for absolutely no reason at all.
That's actually kind of funny. Don't get me wrong, I like them too.
But don't you like the actual characters a lot more?
Don't beat yourself up over it. You like what you like.
Well, thanks for being considerate.
No problem! How about we go watch The Empire Strikes Back?
