Hey, do you like rap music?
I like some of the older stuff, but I'm not familiar with a lot of newer artists.
Really? There are some great ones who are releasing music right now.
Like who?
One I like is Run the Jewels.
That's an unusual name for a rap group.
Yeah, but they're really good. Are you familiar with Killer Mike?
No, I don't think so.
He's an excellent rapper, producer, and DJ. It's his group.
Cool, maybe I should check them out.
