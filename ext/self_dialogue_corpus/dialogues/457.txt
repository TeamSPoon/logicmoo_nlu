Who's your all time favorite NFL team?
Denver Broncos
Really? How come?
I lived in Denver for a few years when I was a kid.
Oh yeah, what years?
1989 - 1993
Oh so you were there for the John Elway years
Yes indeed. One of the greatest QBs of all-time.
Well I don't know about that.
What do you mean, he went to the Super Bowl five times.
And lost 3 times.
Because he didn't have a good team
I don't buy that.
It's more impressive that he made it to the Super Bowl with those teams in the 80s.
Yeah, I don't know. I hear that excuse a lot
And when he finally got some decent support crew like Terrell Davis, they won.
How many times did he win
Twice, back to back. 1997 and 1998.
Who did they beat
Packers and Falcons.
