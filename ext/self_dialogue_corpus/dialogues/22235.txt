Did you see any of the Disney princess movies when you were a kid?
Yes I saw lots of them.
Which princess was your favorite one?
I liked most of them but I really liked the ones that weren’t so wimpy.
So did you like Milan?
She was cool, though the “Little Mermaid” was my favorite.
What was cool about her?
I think I was the right age at the time to get with the theme of wanting to be out on my own, and be brave, and not follow parental rules. What was your favorite?
I liked Mulan.  I thought she was brave and since I was never much of a girly girl she appealed to me.
I can see where she would appeal to a tomboy.
The old ones like “Snow White” seemed to have whimpy characters.  I didn’t want to clean up after the guys.
Me either.  Sleeping beauty wasn’t a good example of a liberated woman.
Have you ever thought of how creepy it is to kiss a sleeping woman you don’t know? Without her permission?
That is kind of weird in retrospect. Almost as weird as Beauty falling in love with her captor.
Also, sleeping beauty got injured doing girly stuff, using the spinning wheel.
Lots of the early ones had girls doing girly stuff, the later ones were better for having well rounded characters.
In “Brave” she got to use a bow, and she was good at it.  Sleeping beauty would never know how to shoot a bow.
Cinderella wouldn’t either.  Cinderella only knew about cleaning and girly stuff, she wanted to be beautiful and go to a dance and marry a prince.
In "Frozen" her true love was her sister, not a guy.
That is a better message for girls.
