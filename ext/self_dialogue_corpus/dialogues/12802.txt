Tell me the Star Wars movies you have seen recently.
I saw the second one.
Oh yeah was that any good do you think?
I enjoyed it.
How was the relationship between anakin and the princess?
They were very cute together.
It seemed very futuristic, don't you think?
Definitely.
We should watch the others sometime.
For sure!
