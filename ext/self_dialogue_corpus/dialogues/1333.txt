So, are you a football fan?
Oh yeah, love watching football.
Who's your favorite team?
I'm a huge Seahawks fan.  I'm from Seattle originally, so I love the 'Hawks.  Who do you like?
I'm a Kansas City fan.  Love the Chiefs!
Yeah, I live in Kansas City now, so I root for the Chiefs too.  Unless they're playing the 'Hawks!
I think the Chiefs are going to do well this year.  I'm sure glad we got Andy Reid a couple of years ago.
Yeah, he's a great coach.  I'm a big fan of Pete Carroll too.
Yes, he's done a great job with the Seahawks.
I was so disappointed when Marshawn Lynch retired.  And now I'm hearing talk that he's thinking of coming back and playing for the Raiders!
Yeah, I heard that too.  I guess he's from Oakland.
Yep.  The sad thing is, they're eventually going to be moving to Vegas, so he won't even be playing in Oakland.
True.  You guys have got a great quarterback in Russell Wilson.
I know, I love Russell!  I was worried that he wasn't going to sign a couple of years ago, when his initial contract was up.  But he did, thank goodness.
The Seahawks have a lot of great players - maybe they'll be in the Super Bowl this year.
That would be awesome.  I just hope it isn't against those darn Patriots!  I hate Tom Brady!
Well, he is getting old.  But I haven't heard any talk about him retiring.
Man, I wish he would retire.  I'm so tired of him.  That Super Bowl a couple of years ago where we lost at the last minute was such a bummer.
I can imagine you were really disappointed.
Yes, I was!  I didn't understand why they didn't just give it to Marshawn and let him punch it in.  Instead they threw that pass that was intercepted.  Darn it!
