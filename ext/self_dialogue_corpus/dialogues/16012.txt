Have you ever been a Rolling Stones fan?
Oh yeah. I love the Rolling Stones.
Really? How long have you been a fan?
Ever since I was age 9, so that makes it about 45 years. For some reason their music has always been cool to me.
Wow! You're a die hard loyal fan I must say. What is your favorite song by them?
O it's hard to say, there are so many. I tend to still like their oldies the best but then there are some from the latter years I'm still loving a lot.
Their album from 1981 Tattoo You is still great.
Oh yea! I love Start Me Up!
I can dance to that one with a lot of nerdy moves.
Me too, dancing is a good thing though no matter how you do it.
I love how Mick changes the words from Start It Up to Start Me Up for some reason in this song.
Yes, I noticed that too, the transition is very creatively done.
Mick Jagger and Keith Richards will always be the best, very creative and talented guys. Still watch their videos on Youtube now and then.
Youtube is great for that. I agree, no one can come close to how they perform. Not even the Beatles in my opinion!
Now many people will probably disagree with you in that.
Are you one of them?
Oh no! I still remain true to my favorite band in the whole world. Brian Jones was also a favorite but it was sad he died.
You are very loyal, and yes it was a tragic about Brian Jones.
Lots of bands go through things like that it seems.
Yes they do and this band always seemed to know how to get through it the best. They keep going strong even at their ages.
