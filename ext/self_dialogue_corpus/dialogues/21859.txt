What's the best Quentin Tarrantino movie?
Hmmm, tough call-- he's got a lot of good stuff.  I'm going to say Jackie Brown.
You don't hear that choice very often.  I'll say Pulp Fiction for mine.
Excellent movie, and yeah, Jackie Brown is overlooked a lot, but I think it's excellent-- the plot, the pacing, the acting.
Yeah, it was my first exposure to Pam Grier, and she killed it.
I like his portion in 4 Rooms, too.
Yeah, I'd go so far to say as the other three segments kinda sucked.
Yeah, I could do without them, despite really liking Tim Roth.
That's the problem with a concept like that-- Roth is the only recurring character in each segment, but his personality is radically different from segment to segment.
That's the risk you run with a concept like that, with 4 different directors that have different styles and stories.
You know what movie of Tarantino's I didn't really care for?  Kill Bill.
Yeah, both of those are ok, but give me Pulp Fiction, give me Reservoir Dogs-- Kill Bill isn't even close.
True Romance is an underrated gem too.
I recently read the comic that Clarence is reading to Alabama on their date.
Wow, you've seen that movie a lot of times if you can recall that bit of detail.
Is 900 times a lot?
Haha, at least it's not Crossroads, with Britney Spears.
Oh, I've seen that 1000 times.
So, you really like Britney Spears?
Eh, not that much, but I do like Taryn Manning.  She's pretty great in Hustle and Flow.
