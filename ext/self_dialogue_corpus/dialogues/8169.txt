Who is your favorite singer?
I've always liked Kelly Clarkson a lot.
I like her too! Have you heard the song Irvine? That's my favorite song she sings.
I love that song. She wrote it herself.
I didn't know she wrote songs too.
Yes, she's written a lot of her own music.
Her voice is so gorgeous.
It is. I've always loved how versatile her voice is.
It is. I remember when she sang Big Band music on American Idol.
Yeah, she sang Stuff Like That There and nailed it!
