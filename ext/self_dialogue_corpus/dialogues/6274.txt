I think the Lion King has the best music of all the Disney movies.
Disney has so many movies with amazing music.
Yes, but the Lion King wasn't just a movie success. It was a broadway success as well.
That's so true.
I just love the story of the Lion King.
It really brings the complicated relationship of father and son to light.
I know and how no matter the differences, fathers would give their lives for their children.
That's true for mothers as well.
Wow! Disney really brings their characters to life.
They sure do.
