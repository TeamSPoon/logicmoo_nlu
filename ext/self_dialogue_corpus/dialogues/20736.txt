What's your favorite type of movie?
I like children's movies. I just started watching them again.
Oh! I watch children's movies with my children.
That's nice.
What is the last children's movie you saw?
I watched Homeward Bound II not too to long ago.
Was it the last children's movie you saw?
I believe it was, yes.
What medium did you see it through?
I watched it on VHS.
I have a VHS player too! People say it's a dead medium but I still like them.
I know! The quality is superb on them.
Did you ever like Betamax?
For movies? No. It was too expensive, we could never afford it.
I know the pain but I love VHS movies too.
Will the world ever go back to VHS?
I wish sister, I wish. I wish they would.
I love VHS movies.
I should start a VHS website. That would be great!
It sure would be.
