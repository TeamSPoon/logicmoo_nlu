Do you like the Coen brothers films?
Yes. No Country For Old Men is my favorite.
Yes! Mine too. I didn't appreciate it the first time I saw it, but 10 years later it's one of my favorite movies.
It's very different than other action/suspense movies but it leaves a lasting impression on you.
There are so many things to appreciate rather than just the story: the cinematography, the acting, the characters.
The villain in that movie is one of the most menacing people in a movie I've ever seen.
It's a perfect Coen brothers movie. The ending is ambiguous and the movie isn't for everyone, but if you like it, you love it.
That's a perfect way to put it. The good guy doesn't always win, or maybe never wins in a Coen flick.
Do you like Fargo?
Yes, it's one of my favorites as well. It's probably their second best movie.
Again, it's another one of their movies that doesn't have a happy ending, or maybe even a satisfying ending.
It's morally corrupt characters who can't seem to catch a break, and it's difficult to watch them constantly mess up.
I love the settings in their movies. In Fargo, the town and landscape is equally as big of a character.
Same thing for No Country For Old Men. It's like the old west in Texas.
I also love the setting in terms of the date in No Country. It feels so authentic to 1980.
I've watched that movie over 15 times. There's not a single mistake or imperfection in the film.
I only use they wouldn't have killed off Moss so quickly.
There was still 30 minutes in the film by the time he was killed.
If they could make the movie more perfect, it would be to extend the total time of the film 30 more minutes and follow Moss around more.
I agree. The most suspenseful part was following Moss around while he's being chased throughout Texas.
