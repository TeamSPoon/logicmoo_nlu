I think my all time favorite band from the 90's was the Backstreet Boys. Were you a fan?
Of course I was! They were the best!
Which was your favorite song of theirs?
I think it was "As Long As You Love Me."
Yes that was a great one!
I also really that one song where they dressed up in costumes in the music video.
You mean the song "Everybody"?
Yes I think that's the one.
Nick Carter used to be so cute.
Yes he was my definite favorite.
