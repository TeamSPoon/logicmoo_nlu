Have you listened to much of Michael Jackson's music?
Quite a bit.    Which era are you interested in?
Well, lets start with the later, more popular material.
OK.     His biggest album was probably Thriller.
I've heard that album.    How many copies did it sell?
The number I've seen is nearly 100 million, but that may be an overstatement.
100 million?     How is that possible?
CDs and records used to sell a lot more copies than they do these days.
Really?     I saw that all it takes is 100000 copies to be a hit these days.
Yes, that is true, particularly since streaming has taken over the industry.
I agree.     What else should I know about Michael Jackson?
Well, he and his brothers sang together as the Jackson 5.
Really?       Which one was he?     I've seen clips on YouTube.
He was the youngest - the kid who was out in front.
Amazing.    Which is that real popular song from them?
You are probably thinking of A-B-C.
That is right.       I also saw some movie he was in, do you know it?
He was in a couple of movies.      You are probably thinking of the Wiz.
That is the one.     An African American version of the Wizard of Oz.
Definitely!    All singing and all dancing!
