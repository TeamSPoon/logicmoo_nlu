I'm in the mood for some rock music, any suggestions?
You should check out a band called Morphine.
Oh really? What is good about them?
For one things, they have no guitars, only a bass player, a saxophone players and a drummer. They have a really unique rock jazz sound to them.
Sounds interesting, are they new?
No they were mostly around in the 90's.
Why aren't they around anymore?
Sadly, their singer and main songwriter, Mark Sandman died.
That's too bad. Was it from a drug overdose?
No, he actually had a heart attack right after a concert in Italy. He had a heart condition.
