Jimi Hendrix was a groundbreaking guitar player.
He sure was.
He introduced the world to all those special guitar effects he did.
Yea, he was the headliner at Woodstock.
And the Isle of Wright.
Do you realize that his career really only lasted for four years?
That is because he died at such a young age.
Yes 27 of a drug overdose.
Boy if he was still alive today could you imagine the music he would have composed?
It would have been amazing.
Remember the song the Wind Cries Mary?
Yea that was a good one and so was Purple haze.
Do you remember how he played the National anthem at woodstock?
Yes  I do.
He was an amazing guitar player.
He was inducted into the Rock and Roll music hall of fame in the 90's.
As well he should be.
That is a great testament to his guitar playing.
Yes it is, now that would have been someone to see.
That is for sure.
