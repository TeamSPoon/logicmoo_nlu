My favorite rapper is Drake.
He can actually rap when he's not singing.
True I wish he would do more rap. Who is your favorite rapper?
My favorite rapper right now is J. Cole but my favorite of all time is Lil Wayne.
Two legends right there.
I agree, they both have a very unique style.

I like Ed Sheeran a lot.
He album was amazing!
He said he was going to take a break but I'm glad he changed his mind.
That #1 song he has is getting overplayed.

Yes, as long as I get to pick what I hear.
