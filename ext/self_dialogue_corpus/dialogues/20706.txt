Have you seen The Shack?
I have.  Though I actually watched it just because my friend wanted me to.
What did you think?
I thought it was intriguing.
Me too.  I'm not real religious, but it was unique.
Yeah.  I love how they made God different races and ages.
I felt like it was a good choice for them to cast that woman from Hidden Figures.
I think her name is Octavia Spencer?
Didn't she win an academy award?
She did.  I think she is amazing.
Well, she did a great job in the shack.
I was amazed by the wife in the movie.
What about her?
How she supported him despite losing the child.  She never blamed him
She definitely played a strong woman.  His journey definitely needed her
Are you religious?
Kind of.  Enough to be drawn into the movie.
Me too.
Do you think non-religious people will like it?
I think so.
