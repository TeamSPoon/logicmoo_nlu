Are you a fan of the Jason Bourne movies?
As if you had to ask.  For sure.
Well what do you like about them?
I like Matt Damon, the mystery, and the international settings.
I like that too.  Its great to see how he travels to all these beautiful places.
Yes!  Like in the first film  That's one of my favorites.
I remember that one.  It had beautiful European sights.
Its known for that.
And he had a German sweetheart too.  Its sad that they got rid of her in the next movie.
Well they were always losing people throughout those films.
I felt sorry for his character.
In the latest Bourne film they did away with his associate Julia Stiles.
She was dedicated.
Yes it was really unfortunate.
Through it all he found out about his dad.
Didn't his dad set him up?
I don't know, but his dad did love him.
He didn't have a happy life.
He found out who he was finally.
I hope they can make some more Bourne films.
