So what have you been listening to lately?
A lot of different stuff. I was on this Bon Iver, Mumford Brothers thing for a while.
I like them. I was listening to Ben Harper and Jack Johnson.
I do them too. I was thinking I miss the Counting Crows. I loved them.
Me too. You must be feeling nostalgic.
Yeah, August and Everything After, 1993...best album ever.
I love that album. "Round Here" is my song.
"Time and Time Again"
I also like instrumental music. Love the cello. You ever listen to any of that stuff?
Olafur Arnalds is so good. Of course.
I like Zoe Keating also. Did you know Olafur was once in punk band?
Get out...his music is now so relaxing. I like to have it on when I'm working or cooking in the background.
Yeah, I have it on when people come over.
I leave it on for the cat. I think it mellows her out.
You should check out Julia Kent too. She sounds a lot like Zoe Keating.
Cellos music is so mellow. Can't believe I used to play the violin.
Really? That's crazy. I never played anything.
I always imagined learning to play the guitar so I play some of that Jack Johnson music.
That would be cool. You should do.
Yeah, I'll add it to list while I'm listening to Olafur!
