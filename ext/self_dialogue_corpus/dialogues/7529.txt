I'm watching all the Harry Potter movies over again.
Oh awesome! I always see something new every time I do.
Wasn't Dumbledore the absolute worst?
Yes! What a master manipulator. I'm pretty sure Grindewald broke up with him because he was so passive aggressive.
Wait, didn't they duel over that whole, "For the greater good" thing?
Yeah, but I'm betting the backstory in the next Fantastic Beasts film shows quite a bit more of it.
I really like Dumbledore though.
You don't get on tumblr much do you? Dumbledore was the worst. He justified leaving a child in an abusive home.
Dumbledore was just trying to protect Harry.
Dumbledore was protecting Dumbledore. I'm telling you, he was the worst.
