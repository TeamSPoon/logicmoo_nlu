Have you seen Inside Out?
I absolutely love that movie! It's from both Disney and Pixar.
Yes and when I went to see it with my kids I cried in the middle of the theater.
Me too, I was blubbering like a baby when Bing Bong died.
It did such a good job of delving into the mind of a young girl and what she was going through.
I heard they employed psychologists to help with the script.
I heard that too, and you can definitely tell.
The animation is good, the comedy is on point, it has the heartfelt element.
And it's very original. The only thing you can compare it to is that old show Herman's Head.
Oh I used to watch that. But I think Inside Out is definitely more interesting and colorful than that ever was.
