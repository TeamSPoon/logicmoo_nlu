Have you heard the song Black Hole Sun?
Yeah, by Sound Garden? I love that song.
That song always makes me think about the past.
Yeah, me too. Those guys must have done a lot of drugs to make a music video like that.
Yeah but its more than that. They are really creative too!
I agree. Its like some people just have the ability to come up with great songs.
Definitely. I wish I had musical talent like that.
Do you play any instruments?
Yeah I have played guitar for 7 years.
Well keep up with it, and some day you'll be really good.
