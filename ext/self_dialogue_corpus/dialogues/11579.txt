What's your favorite Beatles album?
Easy, Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Heart Club Band.
Really? I understand that it's innovative, but I find that it lags in places.
I love all of it. It's the first record that challenged me to give multiple deep listens.
I can't argue with that.
What's your favorite Beatles album?
It's got to be Revolver.
Why Revolver?
I find it to be the most pleasant mix of pop and experimentation. It's concise too!
I see what you're saying, it doesn't drag on at all.
