Who do you think is the best quarterback in the league today?
Tom Brady is the best.
Overall as far as historical accomplishment I agree.  But I mean who will be this year.
Brady is older now his performance might go down now.
So who do you think will be tops this year?
Maybe Aaron Rogers?
I think he will have a good year again as usual.
Matt Ryan is a good quarterback.
Yes, I don't know who will be in the top three now that some of the better ones are getting older are retiring.
Russel Wilson from Seattle.
Russel is good but he doesn't have a very top tier quarterback feel to me.
He is a smart runner.
What about Drew Brees from New Orleans?
I always liked Drew's game quick release and accurate passer.
Like some of the better ones he is also getting older.
What about Big Ben in Pittsburgh?
He's good but maybe in the top ten not top five.
Andrew Luck from Indianapolis is good and what about Cam Newon?
Cam is too much of a show off to me.
I tend to dislike these kind of players too.
