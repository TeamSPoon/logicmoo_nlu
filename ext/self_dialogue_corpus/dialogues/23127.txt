So, are you looking forward to your summer vacation?
I sure am! Being a teacher can be very draining!
I am sure it can. What all do you plan on doing with all of that free time?
Well after we get back from vacation, I plan on watching a lot of movies and eating a lot of popcorn!
That sounds like a lot of fun actually!
I know that I am really looking forward to it.
What kind of movies interests you the most?
I like a lot of different types of films actually. A good suspense movie, or a romantic comedy always gets my attention.
I am the same way; I like a movie that really makes you think.
Yea nothing beats being kept on the edge of your seat during a good suspense movie in my opinion.
Who would you say is your favorite actor?
I think I would have to go with Richard Gere.
I like him as well; he does some high quality movies.
I sure think so. Have you ever seen Unfaithful or Primal Fear?
I know that I have seen Primal Fear, but not sure about the other one.
Unfaithful also stars Diane Lane, it is a good thriller.
I will have to watch that one some time. I am a big fan of Diane Lane.
They are also in that movie Nights In The Rodanthe.
Richard Gere and Diane Lane both star in that one as well?
Yes, they must really enjoy working together!
