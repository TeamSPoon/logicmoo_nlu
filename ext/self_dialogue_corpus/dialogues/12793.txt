What did you think of Ron Howard being the new director.
For what?
The Han Solo, solo film.
I did not know that. I think it is alright.
I wonder why JJ Abrams would not direct it?
I would say due to the fact it will be awful.
Why you say that?
It does not make sense.
Why not?
We already know what happens to him.
