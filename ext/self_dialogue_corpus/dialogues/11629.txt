Ringo didn't sing many of the Beatles songs, did he?
Only eleven of them.
Do you know any of them?
Yellow Submarine is one of them.
That is such a fun song.
He did another fun one called Octopus garden.
I'm not familiar with that one.
It was on the Abbey Road album.
I don't know that album very well.
You probably know some of the other songs from the album.
