What's your favorite soundtrack?
Uh, the first thing that comes to mind is Titanic...
You're awful. Titanic? Really?
Shut up - the single with Celine Dion made me cry.
I think the movie made you cry. That song-
-perfectly enhanced the emotion of the film!
Sure.
Shush. Anyway my other two favorites are Hackers and... The Matrix?
Wow. Celine Dion and electronica? That's a clash.
I don't know. Celine Dion's an outlier. And I liked 90s electronica. Got me motivated.
I was addicted to Dragula.
Rob Zombie's intense. I don't like any of his other stuff but yeah Dragula in The Matrix had me loving him for a second.
Fluke was good in the sequel.
I choreographed a dance to Fluke. That was an awesome one! What about you? - with soundtracks, I mean.
I kind of like scores, so Lord of the Rings wins it for me.
Oh, interesting! If you like atmospheric stuff, have you heard of Massive Attack?
Of course! They're great.
If you like Massive Attack, you should try out Four Tet. Very similar.
Okay, awesome. I'll check them out.
They've got a lot of albums - I loved Rounds, though, personally.
