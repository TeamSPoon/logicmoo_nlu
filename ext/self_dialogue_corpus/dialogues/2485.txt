Hey man, football season is close, are you excited?
Absolutely! Who-Dey Baby! I am all in this season to see Andy Dalton lead the Bengals to the playoffs
How do you feel about their draft class this year? Were you impressed with who they picked up?
I think Ross and Mixon will be great additions to the offense. I also like Ellis, the Linebacker from Kansas State
This is a contract year for Marvin Lewis, do you think he will be back after this year?
Who knows? Mike Brown seems to really like him, even though the Bengals haven't won a playoff game with him as coach
Right, I am not sure either. He is an okay coach, I also know that Mike Brown seems to really like him. I do feel that we need a coach that can us to the next level.
I would love to have an old school Bengal like Max Montoya or Kenny Anderson as head coach. Someone who fans know and love.
My favorite games are the divisional games, the ones with the Steelers, Browns or Raven.
Those are my favorite games too. Those games are the most important ones, they almost count as two games.
Do you know when the Steelers come to town? We should go to that game.
The Steelers come to town on December 4th. That game is even on ESPN
Sounds like a plan, we should totally go. I will buy the tickets and you can pay me back.
Thanks man, I am looking forward to it. My brother is a big Colts fan, and the Colts come to town on October 29th, would you want to go with us?
That sounds like a great time. Games before Halloween are a lot of fun. People dress up, and have a good time.
In the 90s we went to games with bags on our heads, when it wasnt even the Halloween game.
The Browns are in town on November 26th, would you like to go to that game?
I can't, we are going out of town to see family. Otherwise I would. I am sure that is a game the Bengals can win.
Sounds great man. I am excited about this upcoming season
Me too, We will have a lot of fun at these games. Talk to you later.
