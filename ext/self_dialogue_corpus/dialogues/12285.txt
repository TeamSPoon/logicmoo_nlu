Who do you think is the most attractive woman character in the Star Wars movies?
Well, back in the original trilogy it would have easily been Princess Leia?
Now, something is different?
Well I think Natalie Portman as Padme Amidala has her bested.
Oh, you do not think it is just because it is newer?
It is kind of hard to tell I guess.
Yes, everybody in 1970s TV now doesn't look as attractive.
It is the hair the clothing, maybe just the film definition is not as good.
You did not like Rey in The Force Awakens?
Yes, she is cute too but not like Senator Amidala.
