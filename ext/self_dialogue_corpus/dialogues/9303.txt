what is the best rap album of all time
I think it's dr dre's the chronic
thats a pretty good choice
what about you, what would your choice be
I think dre's the chronic is pretty good, but I'm going to go with straight outta compton
really? that's a little bit old at this point
its old, but its the one that really got the whole rap scene going
that's a bold statement
you had ICE cube, Dr. Dre and Eazy E all busting rhymes on the same ablum!
very true. you could also hear all of them on the D.O.C.'s album too though
