You know, I haven't like one of the X-men movies.
You're kidding, I love them all, even the bad ones.
They're all bad. Bryan Singer doesn't understand them.
WOLVERINE, he's great.
He did get him right and professor X.I love it when Wolverine pops his claws...
It's not about that, the story is wrong. Patrick Stewart is great as the professor and Hugh Jackson kills it as Wolverine so he didn't screw up everything.
I dont watch X-men for the stoiry.
That's the problem. If Singer would do good stories instead of messing up all the good stuff in the comics you would watch those movies for the story.
There's stories in the movies.
But they're not good ones. Days of Future Past is sort of like the Terminator in the comic books. They do a little bit of it in the movie.
That does sound cool, the robots were great in that movie.
YEAH, there should have been moire Sentinels and less 70s stuff.
I see.
In X-men 3 they did the Phoenix story and totally botched it up.
I hear they're re-doing it.
Yes, it seems like they're going to do it more like the comics. The comics have great stories.
That sounds good.
It's the reason why Marvel movies dont suck. They pay attention to the comic books.
I thought the X-men were Marvel movies.
They are more like distant cousins. Fox owns the X-men not Msrvel.
