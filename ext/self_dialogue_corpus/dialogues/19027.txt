Did you ever like any of the boy bands from the 90s?
N'Sync and the Backstreet Boys are the only ones that comes to mind.
New Kids on the Block kicked that whole era off in the 80s.
Yes they did. It's Gonna Be Me is my favorite N'Sync song.
I like that one and Bye Bye Bye.
The video for that one is great. I think they were puppets right?
Yes it was a great video. I can't think of any by The Backstreet Boys.
Tearin' up my Heart was a big one from them.
Oh yeah now I remember. They were really big back then.
Justin Timberlake going solo was the best thing he could have ever done.
He had more success solo I think than he did with N'Sync.
He really did. Even I was buying his albums.
He collaborates so well with Timbaland. Their music was made for each other.
My favorite collaboration from the two of them is What Goes Around Comes Around.
Have you seen the video for that song?
No I haven't is it any good?
It sure is. It shows him stalking this female that you know is Britney Spears.
Britney Spears actually agreed to do that video.
I don't know if she agreed to her likeness being used but the woman looked just like her.
Wow that's crazy. Who'd have thought he was so crazy over her?
