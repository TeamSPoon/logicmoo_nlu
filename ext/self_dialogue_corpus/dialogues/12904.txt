Have you seen all of the Star Wars films?
Oh yes, I'm a big fan so I've seen all of the movies many times. I almost have the dialogue memorized.
What was your opinion on Rogue One? Do you think it was as good as the main Star Wars films?
I liked it very much. It was good to see some backstory for how the Rebel Alliance was able to capture the plans for the Death Star.
I liked it too. It had a slightly more dark tone than the main series.
It was definitely grittier than other Star Wars movies.
One amazing thing about the movie was the totally CGI characters, Grand Moff Tarkin and a young Princess Leia.
Yes, on a technical level I was very impressed with the quality of the CGI. Just a few years ago such a thing would have been impossible.
So what was your favorite thing about Rogue One?
The entire third act with the epic space battle was just incredible. Probably the battle sequence out of all Stars Wars movies so that's saying a lot.
