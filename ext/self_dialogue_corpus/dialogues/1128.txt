I would like to see Tom Brady on a different team
Like the Browns?
Yea a team like that.
Why do you say that?
I just want to know if hes a product of Belichick or not.
He has sustained it too long to be a product of a system.
But we may never know
We probably wont but who can stay this good for that long?
Anyone I think!
No eventually you lose it, like Manning did.
He was an outworldy talent.
And we found that out through multiple head coaches
Yeah so you see where I am going
Yeah I tend to agree with you now
So I would think he could be able to reproduce these results, right?
Yes but I dont think hes going anywhere
Well would you rebuild a team with him
great question, i probably would
But you wouldnt win now and hes older.
Yeah this is sort of a catch 22. great food for thought though
