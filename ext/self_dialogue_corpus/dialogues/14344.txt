Who would you rank as the best player in the NBA today?
Steph Curry hands down.
So LeBron isnt on that list anymore?
No his time has passed.
So if you take him off the Cavaliers the results wont wane too much?
No it would dip.
And if you take Curry off the Warriors, they would maintain their position?
They probably could survive that.
OK so you are making my point.
Actually you are making mine.
LeBron is so valuable to his team.
That does not make him the best player
Theres no way they survive without him though.
Yeah but hes that way because of his surroundings.
So do the other players make Steph good?
No hes the best pure shooter ever.
Thats hard to believe.
He doesnt need to drive the ball to be effective.
Well he cant with that frame.
I still do not subscribe to your viewpoint.
