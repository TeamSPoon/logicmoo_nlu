When you think of pop music, what singer or group do you think of?
Britney Spears, in her day she was great.
My son had a huge crush on her, of course I think all of the boys did.
She was adorable. I liked all of her songs.
Whitney Houston had a lot of hit pop songs too.
She had the most beautiful voice I have ever heard, I love the song I Want to Dance with Somebody.
My favorite song of her's is I Will Always Love You.
That was Dolly Parton's song. Dolly made it country and Whitney made it pop.
They both did a great job with that song. Funny how a different a song can be when sung by someone else.
Yeah, I also love the song she sang Run To You.
