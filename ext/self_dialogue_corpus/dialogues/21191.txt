Have you seen the new Beauty and the Beast yet?
The live action one with Emma Watson?
Yes, she's my favorite.
I haven't seen it yet.
I saw it in theaters with my boyfriend.
Was it any good?
It was amazing! Especially the musical numbers.
I watched the cartoon version a lot when I was younger.
So did I, it was one of my favorites.
Did the live action version hold up to your expectations?
It exceeded them by far!
Really? How so?
The whole thing was just splendidly done. From the dialogue to the casting to the colors.
Do you think my kids would like it?
I think so. It is a little intense, so I maybe wouldn't let little ones watch it.
What do you mean?
Some of the fight scenes, especially towards the end might be a little scary for kids under like seven or eight.
Other than that, you really enjoyed it?
I loved it! Definitely my favorite movie of the year!
Wow! I'll have to see it soon!
