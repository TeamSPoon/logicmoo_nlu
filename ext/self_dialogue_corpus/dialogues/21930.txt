What are your thoughts on Robert Downey, Jr. as Holmes?
I really like the movies. I like Jude Law is a great Watson.
Yeah, he really elevates Watson.
And I think the second one with Moriarty is BRILLIANT.
I feel a qualification coming.
I don't think RDJ was a great Sherlock.
But, it is that just because Cumberbatch is the goat.
No, no Jeremy Brent is the goat. He played Holmes as written and still made it interesting.
True. But I liked RDJ as Holmes before I saw Cumberbatch.
I go Brent, then Cumberbatch. I think the movies just go on too long.
I think the writting in the TV show is much better.
I do too, except for the way they write Mycroft.
Well, that's because Mycroft is a writer on the show and wants to have a bigger part.
I really like the Mycroft in the RDJ movies.
I liked Mary in those movies.  I wasn't a fan of Mary as an assisan in the show.
Yeah, I agree.
I like Mary being relevant but NOT a hired assasian.
I also like the Moriarty in the movies.
Well, I like the one in the series too.
But the movie one is more traditional version with the math professor thing.
