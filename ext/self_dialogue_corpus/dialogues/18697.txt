Do you like Taylor Swift?
Everybody likes Taylor Swift.
You think so? I kind of don't like some of her stuff.
Oh, really? Like what?
Well, I like a decent amount of the pop music she's done lately.
What don't you like? Her earlier stuff?
Yeah, I'm not big into the sappy country side of her music.
That side is her whole origin story though.
I can understand that, but it's just a little too cheesy to me.
I guess it's a little cheesy.
What are some of your favorite songs by her?
I like Shake it Off a lot, that one is really catchy.
Yeah, me too. That's one of her best ones.
I think so too, also Blank Space is really good.
I think both of those are definitely her most catchy songs.
What do you think about her concerts?
I haven't been to one, I'm not really good with big crowds.
She definitely does get a lot of people in her crowd.
Yeah, everybody who likes pop pretty much loves Taylor Swift.
It's interesting to have watched her slowly shift from country to pop.
