Do you like Cruel Intentions?
Yes
Who directed it?
Honestly, I have no idea
I kind of like a movie that does not have a known director
I see what you mean.
Did you like Sarah Michelle Gellar?
I thought she was very good
She was awesome and her appearance was great
I loved her black outfit and her hat
Did you like the ending?
Yes. It was so unexpected
I was sad that Sebastian dies
I'm glad he found love though
Me too. I did not expect it
That movie was very hardcore
I know. It was definitely for mature audiences.
I wonder if there is a part 2
There is, but none of the people from the 1st one are in it
That's too bad
