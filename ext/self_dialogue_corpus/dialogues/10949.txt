Do you like hockey?
No way! It's too violent and dangerous!
I think it's as dangerous as football, sure, but I think a lot of the violence is for show.
Why do you think all the violence isn't real?
Our town used to have a minor league team, and I went to a lot of games. And without fail, every game, one of the players would get into a fight and get so mad he tore his shirt off.
You're kidding, right?
No, seriously, they would pretend to have a big fight and the refs would get involved, and the star player would get sent to the penalty box and be so angry he took his shirt off.
I don't think I've ever been so angry I felt the urge to strip!
I know, right? It was just to show off his athletic build, entertain the fans, and especially get the women more involved in rooting for a certain team or certain players.
But nobody ever got seriously hurt?
No. It would looks incredibly painful, like somebody was slammed into the wall or the ice, or hit with a stick, but there were never any serious injuries. The players would be fine and just keep on playing.
Hockey seems like it would be difficult to follow.
It really isn't. The basic rules aren't that hard to learn, and it really has some similarities to sports like football or soccer.
I like football. Does a hockey game have four quarters and a halftime?
No, hockey games have three periods. But in between the periods, there's usually something going on to amuse the fans, just like a halftime.
Do hockey teams have cheerleaders who wear those skimpy outfits out onto the ice.
Yep. I don't know how they do it. But teams have cheerleaders and mascots just like in other sports, and they help pump up the fans.
The only place you can really watch a live hockey game is in Canada, right?
No! It's not like the teams are playing on frozen lakes. The game are held indoors on a man-made ice rink.
I never thought about people being able to play hockey even if they didn't live somewhere that gets freezing cold all the time!
