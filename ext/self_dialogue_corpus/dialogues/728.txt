I'm really confused about the NFL and its TV schedule.
How so?
Well, they have one Monday Night matchup and all-day Sunday.
Right...
But why do they need Thursday?
Maybe they feel threatened by college, or other TV shows that in no way affect them.
I also don't like that on Sundays, there's only ever two games on at once.
Yeah, they only have deals with the NFL network, CBS, Fox, and NBC.
I don't even get the NFL network.
Yeah, they just will do anything for money.
In college there's always like eight games on at once so you have a legitimate choice
Right, but this is the NFL. The commissioner would never have it.
It's really all about the money isn't it?
Yup. I rarely can watch a game anyway because my team gets blacked out a lot.
I wish the NFL network would be available everywhere, and you could choose what game you wanted at any time.
Me too. Too bad logic doesn't make money.
Too bad they pay their players millions of dollars each, thus necessitating it.
It's a bit extravagant.
I'm just hoping they don't go to Wednesdays or Tuesdays.
Me too; it's too excessive.
