What's your favorite zombie movie?
Night of the Living Dead, the original one, hands down.
I knew you'd pick that cheesy movie.
Cheesy? It kicked off the zombie genre. It's the best.
Want to know which one is my favorite?
What?
28 Weeks Later.
Oh, come on. There weren't any zombies in that movie.
Maybe not by definition, but they were still ravenous people eaters weren't they?
No, they were a bunch of crazy cannibals. They weren't even reanimated.
