Have you heard of the band AJJ?
No, I don't think so. What kind of music is it?
They're an alternative rock band.
I like alternative rock. Do you think I would like them?
They're pretty different. Their songs are cool though.
How many albums do they have?
Oh, they have a ton. They've been touring for over ten years now.
Wow! Do they have a big following?
No, not really.
That's cool. Where do they play?
We saw them in VA Beach, but they play all over the country.
Maybe we should go to their next show.
Yeah, that would be fun!
Do they tour with any bands I've heard of?
Probably not. They played with a band called Mannequin Pussy at the show we went to.
That's an interesting name for a band...
Yeah, AJJ actually stands for Andrew Jackson Jihad. But they decided to be more politically correct.
Wow, that's really weird!
It definitely gives you a glimpse into what their music will be like.
Sounds crazy!
