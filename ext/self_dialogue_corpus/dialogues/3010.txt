Did you watch the Super Bowl this year?
Sort of. I went to a Super Bowl party but I mostly just pay attention to see the commercials when the Super Bowl is on.
Are you not a football fan?
No, I'm not a huge fan. Are you?
I am! I love football!
Who is your favorite team?
I really love the New England Patriots.
They seem like a pretty good team.
Yeah, Tom Brady is one of the best players of all time.
He's one of the few professional football players I know of, so he must be!
Which other players are you aware of?
Hmm, I've heard of Colin Kapernick, Peyton and Eli Manning, Aaron Rodgers, Tony Romo, and Tim Tebow.
Yeah, they're all famous but not all of them are active players right now.
What do you mean?
Well, Tony Romo actually just retired this year, and Peyton Manning retired last year.
Is Eli Manning still active?
Yeah. He's on the New York Giants right now I'm pretty sure.
What about Tim Tebow?
He's not officially retired I don't think but his career in the NFL seems pretty much over.
Wow. I guess I don't know a lot about the NFL at all.
