What's your favorite scene in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire?
I love the Yule Ball scene.
I like that one too, but it makes me mad when Ron ruins the whole thing for Hermione.
He was kind of a jerk to her in that movie. Neither him nor Harry thought she could get a date.
And then she ends up being asked by Viktor Krum, the most famous guy at the school!
I think Ron's just jealous because he secretly loves Hermione.
He really does love her, but they don't even kiss until the end of the Deathly Hallows Part 2.
I was kind of surprised that they ended up together.
Really? I think they make a good couple. Definitely better than Harry and Ginny.
Oh, I know. Ginny is the most boring character in the entire series.
