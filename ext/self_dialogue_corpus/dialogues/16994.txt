Guess who I got to see in concert last week!
Who?
John Legend!
That's awesome! Where was he playing?
At the Bank of America Pavillion at the SeaPort.
Nice! Who was his opener?
Gallant.
I haven't heard of him before.
He's not as popular as John obviously. But his stuff is good.
So how was the show?
It was pretty good -- I didn't like the venue, but John's voice is just incredible.
I can imagine.
Everyone was on their feet the whole time. And his backup singers were pretty damn great.
Did they sing the parts of his songs with other artists?
Yeah, one of them sang Brittany Howard's verse on that one song from his new album.
What song did he end on?
All of me, of course.
He has such better songs though.
Yeah, but that was the biggest one from his new album so far.
I guess.
