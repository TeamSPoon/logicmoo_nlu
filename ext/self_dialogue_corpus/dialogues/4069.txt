What's your favorite thriller movie?
Would have to be Cape Fear
The original it the remake?
Have actually only seen the remake, but the great Robert De niro is ultra creepy in it.
I agree, he's such a great actor and that films is outright chilling.
Have you seen the original?
No I also haven't seen the original, but have been wanting to.
I would be interested in watching them back to back, you willing?
Sure let's plan on it and then we can compare, De Niro is going to be tough to best though.
Agreed, Nick Nolte also does a great job in the remake as well. The original dies have some definite talent though, Gregory Peck for example.
