What do you think of the Cleveland Browns in the NFL?
Didn't Pat Schurmur, a former Michigan State Spartan, coach there a few years ago?
Yes, actually, I met him in person at a dinner once.
That's kind of cool. What did you think of him?
He was a really nice guy, but I had no idea he was coaching the Cleveland Browns.
Seriously? That's funny.
I heard him talking about playing at Michigan State and then asked him what he did after college.
What did you say??
I just said, I overheard him talking about playing football, and what was he doing now?
And, what did he say?
"I'm the coach of the Browns".   I was so embarrassed.
Well, you wouldn't have known if he was coaching the Browns, since you don't live in Cleveland.
Later, I found out that the locals weren't that impressed, because the Browns weren't doing well.
But how many people can say they met a head NFL Coach in person?
And, after a couple of years, he moved on become the Offensive coordinator and then interim head coach of the Philadelphia Eagles.
So, I heard that he's moved on again to the Minnesota Vikings.
Yes, I think that happened in 2016.
And, I hear he's now the Offensive Coordinator with the Vikings
Yes, It looks like he's definitely more comfortable being an offensive coordinator vs. the head coach.
Well, hopefully, he does well for the Vikings!
