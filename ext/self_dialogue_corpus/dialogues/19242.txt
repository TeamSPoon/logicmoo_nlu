Who's the greatest band of all time?
That's a complex question.
I personally think it is The Beatles.
That's a good choice.
They had a ton of hits and were cultural icons.
What about Elvis?
I don't really think of Elvis as a band.
Ok, what about The Rolling Stones?
The Stones have had a lot of hit songs but I don't think they are bigger than The Beatles.
The Rolling Stones have been around a lot longer.
The Stones have been around forever.
The Stones are still on tour.
Aren't they in their 70s now?
They have to be.  They started in the 60s.
I think it was actually 1962.
That is a long run.  50 plus years of being a rock star.
Keith Richards looks a little, well very, rough now.
Mick Jagger still moves around for being in his 70s.
You know what, because of how long they have been around, I can understand The Rolling Stones as one of the greatest of all time.
I would say they are my favorite band.
