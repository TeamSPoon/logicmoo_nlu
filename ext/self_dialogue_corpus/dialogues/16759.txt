What kind of music did you listen to in high school?
I liked new wave, post-punk, punk. How about you?
Heavy metal.
Ha. I would of hung out with you in the parking lot.
Ha. What bands specifically did you like?
I was really into The Cure, Siouxsie and the Banshees, Joy Division.
The Cure was so lame. Are you embarrassed?
No. I mean, I don't like anything made after Disintegration, but that album and everything prior to that is solid.
I will have to take your word for it.
What kind of metal were you into ?
Metallica
Yeah. I liked Metallica, too. I loved Ride the Lightening and And Justice for All....
Classics!
Totally. I used to listen to Danzig, too.

Do you still listen to the same kind of music?
Yes. I still listen to the same music but my taste has expanded.
Yeah. I wound up getting really into harp music.
