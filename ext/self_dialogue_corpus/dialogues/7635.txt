After Dumbledore and Voldemort, who do you think was the most powerful wizard?
I'm going with Snape.  He went under cover that whole time and was never found.
Yeah that was amazing.  Probably the most well written part of the whole series.
And it shows you the true scope of Dumpledores genius.
That he masterminded the whole plot from the very beginning.
It does kind of bring into question what kind of man he is though.  He sacrificed himself but also a lot of others as well.
Yes, indeed he did.  It was for the greater good but who knows maybe there was a better way.
As powerful as he was, he might have been able to find a way to defeat Tom Riddle.  He was able to destroy horcuxes himself.
But with great difficulty, and Harry ended up a horcrux at the end.
Yeah, I guess you're right.  But he could have stopped Voldy before he went after Harry.
