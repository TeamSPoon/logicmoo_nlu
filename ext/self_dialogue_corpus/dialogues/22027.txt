Do you want to come over and hang out?
Sure, what do you want to do?
I am in the mood to just lay around and watch some movies.
That sounds fun, want me to bring some?
Yes, do you have anything romantic?
I have Only You; it is pretty good.
Is that with Robert Downey Jr.?
It sure is, I love him in it.
What else could you bring?
I have the movie Sabrina staring Harrison Ford.
I have heard of that but never seen it.
I like it pretty well myself.
I guess you could bring those two and maybe one more.
Sounds good; another romance movie?
Yes that would be great.
No problem, how about Pretty Woman?
I love that one!
Great! I will bring those three on over then.
I can not wai! See you soon.
Sounds good, I will bring some tissues as well!
