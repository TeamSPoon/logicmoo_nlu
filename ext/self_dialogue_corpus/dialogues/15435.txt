Hey have you heard Jack White's new single?
Who is Jack white?
You know, the guy from, The White Stripes?
Oh! That band with the girl drummer?
Yeah! The new single is called, "Lazaretto."
Is it like his other stuff?
Sort of, but it's a little more fast-paced.
I liked the White Stripes. They were always a really bluesy band.
Yeah, they always reminded me of a band out of the sixties or something.
So is he just solo now?
Yeah it's him and a band but the White Stripes broke up years ago.
Oh yeah, and he has a few other bands right??
Yes, two or three.
What're they called?
One is called The Raconteurs and the other is called The Dead Weather.
Do any of them have a girl in the band like the White Stripes?
Yeah, The Dead Weather has a girl singer and Jack White plays the drums.
Oh okay, should I give them a listen?
Yeah, and if you like them, you should listen to The Kills, it's the front woman for the Dead Weather's other band.
Oh okay, awesome, I need new music to look up.
