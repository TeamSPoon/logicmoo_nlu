What are you watching?
The trailer for The Hitman's Bodyguard.
That's a new one on me. Who's in it?
Samuel L Jackson, Ryan Reynolds,Gary Oldman, Élodie Yung and Salma Hayek.
What's the story about?
The plot follows a bodyguard who is hired to protect a hitman who has to testify at the International Court of Justice.
So who is who?
What do you mean?
Who is the hit man and who is the body guard?
Ryan Reynolds Is Michael Bryce, a protection agent and Samuel L. Jackson is Darius Kincaid, the hitman.
This is  going to be so weird to watch.
This looks fun and dumb please take my money.
Nick Fury and Deadpool in one movie?﻿
I know right. This is so stupid and funny.
The fact that they're playing Whitney Huston's award winning song from the Bodyguard just makes this so much funnier.
I am going to see this movie.
I think it will be a hit.
So basically this movie is about Samuel L. Jackson playing Samuel L. Jackson and Ryan Reynolds playing Ryan Reynolds huh?
Where do I buy the tickets?﻿
This is going to be good.
