So are you ready for The Incredibles 2 to come out?
Whoa, the Incredibles is getting a sequel??
Yeah! It comes out in 2018!
Dude, that's amazing! The first one was so good.
I quote that movie all the time, especially the intro.
The line about feeling like the maid cracks me up every time.
Oh and the super suit line! "I am your wife, I am the greatest good you are ever gonna get!"
Frozone was truly a comedic genius.
I hope they don't mess it up with a sequel, do you know what it's going to be about yet?
Not sure, but it's the same director and he said he'd never do a sequel unless he had an idea, so I'm excited.
