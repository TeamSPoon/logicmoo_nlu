Is there any young musician or band that I ought to be keeping my eye on these days?
What do you mean?
Some up and comer who is on the verge of blowing up and becoming a huge star in the world of music.
Ah, gotcha! Well, I'm not as plugged into the musical scene as I used to be.
More than me, though! Ever since having a child, it's been tough to listen to music like I used to.
OK, let me think. Do you know who Vince Staples is?
Yeah, I've heard his stuff. He's good!
He's definitely good. Him, Earl, and Kendrick are part of a generation of really talented California rappers.
I've definitely listened to a lot of Kendrick Lamar. Who is Earl, though?
Earl Sweatshirt. He was originally part of Odd Future, but has broken away to be a solo star.
I'm not familiar with Odd Future either.
Really? That's surprising, they've been semi-established for a few years now.
Like, I said, when you've got a baby to deal with, music kind of recedes into the background a little.
Fair enough. Odd Future is a collection of singers and rappers let by Tyler the Creator.
OK, I know Tyler. And now that you mention it, I think I heard something about Frank Ocean being in a group with him.
Yep, that's Odd Future. Anyway, Earl is probably the best MC out of the whole group.
Better than Tyler, you'd say?
I would argue so.
OK, if that's the case then I should give him a listen! Thanks.
No problem, glad I could help you out.
