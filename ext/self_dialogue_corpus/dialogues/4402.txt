What was the name of that movie with Nic Cage and John Travolta?
Face Off?
Yeah, that's it.
Why do you ask?
I was trying to find it on Netflix.
I haven't seen it in a while.
Did you like it?
I don't remember.  I mean I like Cage and Travolta, so I think I did.
I thought it was pretty good.
Well, let me know if it's still what you remembered.
