Did you hear about that new movie that Mel Gibson directed?
Are you referring to Hacksaw Ridge?
Yes, that's the one!
Yes, I saw it and really enjoyed it!
Was it as good as a lot of the reviews were claiming?
It certainly was...maybe even better!
How so?
Well, the action was intense and the acting was terrific.  The plot was the best part, though!
Really?  Wasn't it based on a true story.
Yes, it was and, from what I heard, it was authentic.
Well, that's always appealing.  Wasn't Vince Vaughn in it?
Yes and he did a great job.
That's not his typical role is it?
Not all.  He definitely delivered though.
Was it a tearjerker or what?
I didn't cry but a friend of mine did.  It is really emotional.
You're making me want to see it!
You definitely should!  It's not playing at the theaters anymore, though.
Is it available to rent on DVD yet?
It probably is but I'm not sure.  Let me know if you find it and I'll watch it with you!
