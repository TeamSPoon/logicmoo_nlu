What is your favorite movie of all time?
Wow, there are so many that I really liked. I really enjoyed the movies like Goonies and Gremlins. They have a little bit of everything.
I like those too. Did you ever see Big Trouble In Little China?
Kurt Russell? Yeah, that was pretty good. I remember that.
Maybe the Indiana Jones movies. The first one was the best. I like those adventure movies.
Good one. I liked those too. I liked Caddy Shack and Stripes too.
Bill Murray is really funny but I hated Groundhog Day.
Me too. I felt like I was living it. It could not end soon enough.
Do you remember those Mel Brooks movies?
Like Men in Tights. That was funny, but what about Blazing Saddles!
Oh my god. I laughed so hard when they were sitting around the campfire....farting!
I know. I don't know why it cracks you up but once you start laughing...forget it.
Airplane was part of that time period. All the Leslie Neilson movies.
Is that what that guys name is? Yeah, he did a ton of those movies but I didn't see them all. Only a few.
Trading Places was pretty funny. Back in the day, Eddie Murphy was so funny.
Oh yeah, his Gumby....that was a funny movie. And Golden Child.
I wish he were still funny. He's not any more.
Do you remember Raising Arizona? or Pee Wee's Big Adventure?
Loved both of those....Can you say Tortilla?
Aw, the lady from Saturday Night Live at the Almo!
