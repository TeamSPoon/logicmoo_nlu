What is your favorite Disney cartoon musical?
My favorite is Aladdin.
Why Aladdin?
I think Robin Williams did a really good job being the voice of the genie.
He was pretty funny.
I also liked the music.
What was your favorite song?
Friend Like Me. How about you?
I liked A Whole New World.
That's a really pretty song.
