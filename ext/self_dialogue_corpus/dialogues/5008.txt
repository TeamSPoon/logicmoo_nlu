did you watch the Royals game last night?
yes, it was another low scoring game.
Did they win?
Yes, they won 3-2.
What pitcher won the game?
Joakim Soria. I can't believe he actually got anyone out with his stuff.
Who was the starting pticher?
Danny Duffy. He did well, he allowed 2 runs in 7 innings.
Wow, that's great, too bad he didn't get the win.
Yes, he's been our only really reliable pitcher this year.
So how did the Royals score their runs?
Brandon Moss hit a home run into the fountains in right field.
I can't believe that! He's had such a bad year.
Maybe he is finally seeing the ball better.
Who will be pitching when we go to the game tomorrow?
Unfortunately, Chris Young.
Oh, wow, that's going to be a slugfest, and not good for us.  Well, at least our Mom's will have a chance to talk during the game since it will be over by the 2nd inning!
Well, going to the game is always fun regardless of how bad they do.
You're right, I'm really looking forward to going, since we don't get to go very often, and I know our Mom's will enjoy going to see a baseball game in person.
Me too, plus, they are giving away sun hats for Mother's Day for all of the Mom's, so that will be nice for them to wear while watching the game in the sun.
