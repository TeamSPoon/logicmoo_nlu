I watched this movie called Train to Busan recently and thought it was so good!
Is that the zombie Korean movie?
That's the movie. It's about a train that's been infected by a zombie outbreak. The passengers are trying to avoid infection and can't get off the train so it's really suspenseful and scary.
That's been on my top list to watch. Korean horror movies have really taken a step up in terms of quality. I have gotten tired of movies like The Conjuring and those Paranormal Activity movies.
Oh this is definitely still a take on zombie movies but they just know how to add good drama to go along with the heavy horror elements. I was at the edge of my seat the whole movie, as it's such a quick pace movie, the zombies run!
Is this like the World War Z zombies that chase and pile on each other?
Actually it kind of is, there's one scene where the zombies outside the train are trying to catch onto a train and create a chain to reach the train, it was pretty awesome.
Do you know who the main characters are in this movie?
I don't remember their names but the group of characters center around a father and his young daughter as well as a group of people who are really good actors. I cared for all of them, rooting for them to survive.
I'll have to give Train to Busan a watch, this sounds like the fresh type of horror movie I need to catch.
