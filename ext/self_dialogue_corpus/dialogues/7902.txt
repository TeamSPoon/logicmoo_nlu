Was N Sync the best boy band in the 90s?
Depends on what your standards were.
As far as album sales.
I think they were close with Backstreet Boys
I would say they had better careers
Most of them are still working in the media
Justin Timberlake launched a huge career
Yeah and none of the Backstreet Boys are doing anything
Joey Fatone has a huge career do
Yeah I would say N Sync is number one
