Did you see the Astros-Yankees game yesterday?
Which one? They had to play two games due to bad weather this weekend.
The night game, the one that was broadcast on ESPN.
Yes, I did see that one, where Derek Jeter's number was retired.
The Yankees almost made a comeback, but still lost 10-7.
They must have, because when I watched it, the Astros were up 9-0.
That's because in large part to George Springer hitting two home runs.
Don't forget Bregman's grand slam.
That too, and that just spoiled the Yankees' night.
Yeah, but at least they won the first game of the doubleheader.
Didn't the Nationals and the Phillies have to play two yesterday also?
Yes. The bad weather was all over the northeast, causing many games to be postponed.
I saw that Bryce Harper hit a home run in the first game.
He hit the game winning home run Saturday night.
That kid is amazing. He's got one of the best batting averages right now.
And he is indeed still a kid. He's only 24 years old.
He might be in the hall of fame once his career is over.
I predict he will have at least 500 home runs in his career.
I think he'll have more than that, perhaps 600 or 650 home runs.
There are very few baseball players who have hit that many home runs.
