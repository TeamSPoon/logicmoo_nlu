I think the Patriots are going to be the best team again this year!
i have to agree with you, nobody is better than Tom Brady.
I love their additions this offseason.
I think the best pick-up was Brandon Cooks.
Cooks gives them an added speed dimension they haven't had since Randy Moss.
People also forget they are getting Gronk back.
Unbelievable, that they were able to win the Super Bowl without Gronk.
It's almost like they're adding the best tight end in the league as a free agent.  He missed most of the year last year.
I love watching Gronk play - he's unstoppable.
A total mismatch at tight end.
We're forgetting they haven't lost anyone good and they upgraded at running back.
I agree, Gillisee is an upgrade over Blount.
Gillisee is a well rounded player, he can catch, he's big and he can block.
You forgot, a healthy Dion Lewis is a mismatch at times.
I also like Burkhead.
I'd be willing to be that they will move him all over the formation.
They are so loaded on offense, they're 3rd stringers would start for most teams.
Possible they go 16-0 this year.
We forgot to mention Belicheck.
The greats coach in NFL history.
