Do you think Rey is going to end up being Luke's daughter?
No I dont see that as a plausible end
They could flip the script on all of us!
I think you have a better chance of Jabba the Hut being a human.
True, I just wish they would have more plot twists.
I think Finn and her may end up together
So it could be like a Leia and Han type of thing.
Yeah I wish Han was in this one too.
Well they sort of cant do that.
I hope this wraps up some storylines though.
