Did you know that the name Joanne came from Lady Gaga's aunt?
I didn't know that. I just knew this album felt more personal.
Yeah. It's way more stripped down.
That makes sense. I heard she was touring dive bars.
So what's your favorite song from Joanne?
I like John Wayne. It feels tough.
I like that the album has an almost country music feel in places.
I thought so too. But like, good country music.
Yeah. I'm listening to Perfect Illusion right now.
Have you heard her perform it acoustically yet? It's incredible.
