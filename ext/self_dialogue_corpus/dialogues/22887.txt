What did you think about 'Pitch Perfect?'
I think it was a fun movie with catchy songs, but with a few weaknesses.
Which weaknesses in particular?
Well, what stood out was that the characters were too one-dimensional.
Do you mean Becca, Anna Kendrick's character?
Yes.  She was too self-centered and fake edgy.
I felt that way too, even though I really love Anna Kendrick as an actress.
Also, the supporting characters weren't fleshed out well either.  They were all stereotypes.
Yes, there was an Asian character stereotype, a lesbian character stereotype, among others.
And there was no pay-off with those stereotypes.  No hidden commentary.
Yes, they were sort of just there for cringeworthy one-liners.
That was indeed probably the movie's greatest weakness.
Aside from that, what did you like though?
The music mashups were all really well done.
The riff-off was creative and an interesting spin on a cappella genre.
Way more fun than Glee.
I also love the actor Adam Devine.
Is he the guy from 'Workaholics?'
Yes.  He's so funny.
He's hysterical.  His character really made the movie for me.
