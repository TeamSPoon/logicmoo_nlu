Are you excited to see the roster for the New York Giants. I know some of them.
Yes! Amazing team.
Odell Beckham Jr is still a wide reciever.
He is good no doubt.
Of course Eli Manning is the quarterback.
I love him. I wish Peyton still played.
I do too. he was of great value to the teams he played with.
He did amazing with the Colts.
Brandon Marshall is still playing and he is a wide reciever.
I like him and I like seeing him on sports shows also.
Ereck Flowers plays tackle.
I am unsure if I have heard of him.
He is good.
I will have to look him up and look at his stats.
Josh Johnson is also a quarterback.
I am unaware of him also. There is alot I have to look into!
I am sure he will play if he is needed.
Hopefully Eli will do better this year.
I hope so too, Manning's have a lot of value.
I agree. Great football family right there!
