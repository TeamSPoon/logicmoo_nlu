Did you know that the NFL season starts on September 7th this year?
That is coming up quick. Who is your favorite team?
I'm a big Tennessee Titans fan since I live in Nashville.
Are you going to any of the games?
I am going to try to get tickets to the first home game.
When is the first home game?
It is Sunday, September 10th at Noon.
Who are they playing?
The Titans are playing the Oakland Raiders.
That should be a good game. What's the name of your stadium?
It is Nissan Stadium.
I think I passed by there once.
You probably did because it's in downtown Nashville.
Oh, right. When's the second home game?
It is on September 24 against the Seahawks.
I'd rather see the Titans play the Colts. When is that game?
They play the Colts on October 16th.
That would be a nice time for me to visit Nashville.
Yes, I'll try to get us some tickets to the Titans/Colts game.
That would be great. I would love to go!
