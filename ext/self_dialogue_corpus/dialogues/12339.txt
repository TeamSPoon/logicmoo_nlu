I love the Ewoks!
Really, I never liked them. They look like teddy bears. They ruined Return of the Jedi.
No, they didn't. They were awesome!
Awesome for cute little teddy bears, you mean.
That's not fair. Chewbacca is cute too.
Chewie would hurt you for even suggesting that.
I really don't see how you can think Chewbacca is tough, but ewoks are teddy bears.
Ewoks are so small and they speak gibberish.
Right, because everyone can understand Chewbacca.
Everyone in the movies, seems to do okay. Ewoks, are primitive teddy bears. You won't change my mind.
