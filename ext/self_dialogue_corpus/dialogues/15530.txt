Who's your favorite music artist?
I would have to say Bruno Mars
Bruno Mars?!? Are you serious??
Yes, he's got some real talent.
I beg to differ.
How can you argue against it. He has multiple grammys and performed at Super Bowl 50 halftime show.
All that's overrated.
And his songs are great
Please do tell. Which of his songs are great?
Grenade and Just the Way You Are to name a couple
Oh please. Both of those songs are way overplayed
No way man. They still hold up.
Where is he from anyway?
Grew up in Honolulu and had a lot of music influence while growing up.
Oh yeah, like who?
He's mainly influenced by Michael Jackson and Prince
Yeah, I can see that in some of his performances.
I thought you said you can't stand him.
Well not really. I do like watching him perform.
Ah, so it sounds like you might be a fan after all.
