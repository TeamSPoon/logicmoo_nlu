Do you like Abba?
Abba? You mean the group from the 70's?
I think they were around in the 80's, but yeah.
I like their music, or what I know, at least!
Their music is the basis of Momma Mia.
Oh, okay then! I know Mamma Mia.
I think all their stuff are just classics.
Well what are your favorites of them?
Okay, I love Dancing Queen.
Good choice, it is great.
I just love the beat, the message, the tone....
It just makes me wish I was 17 again.
Haha! I also like The Winner Takes it All.
Yeah, I know that one! Meryl Streep did a cover for the movie!
Yep, I just think their voices sound great.
Just to make sure....they aren't still together are they?
Nope, it's been a while for them.
Well I wish they were reunited.
Yeah, I would definetely go see them and jam out.
Me too!
