So, the ultimate question, Marvel or DC movies?
That is really a hard on to choose, they both have their own qualities.
I pick Marvel, myself.
Why is that?
Well, Marvel has a bigger story line and almost all their superhero movies combine into one.
I do like that all of Stan Lee's creations have a sort of central world.
The Marvel Universe. From Spider man to the mutants, they all connect.
Do you think Xmen will merge with the Avengers any time soon?
I am sure some of the Heroes will cross over.
We can only hope to see a Logan and Spiderman reunion.
