What is your secret pleasure/ guilty pleasure music or song?
I am shy to admit but I love selena gomez's love you like a love song .
I don't think you should be embarrassed she is very popular.
Ya popular with teens mostly.
I think she is in the same fan base as taylor swift katy perry. Nothing to be ashamed about,
I suppose that is fair  to say. Maybe I should not hide my love for her music.
Exactly, I like her gin and juice song. Not sure of the title.
That would be, hands to myself.
Yes that is it. Such a good song.
It is featured in her pantene commercial . I thought that was very smart of them to use that song specifically.
It is such an adult song when you think about it.
True. Suggestive lyrics for sure.
Crazy when you think she was one of the little kids on barney!
She was? I did not know that about her.
Yep she got her start on that show I believe.
I wonder if that is one reason beiber loved her so much.
Funny. Probably did watch that ,seems about the right show for his age.
I always wanted them to get back together.
Not me. I am happy she is with the weekend. i want them to collaborate on some music.
I think I heard some rumors that they have been in studio already working on some songs.
