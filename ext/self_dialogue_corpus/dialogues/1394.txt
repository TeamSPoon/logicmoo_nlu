What do you think of the Pittsburgh Steelers chances this year?
If they keep Big Ben healthy they have a shot.
They can be really good.
It's not just Big Ben either.
I'd say they're running game is pretty good too.
I would say so with Le'Von Bell.
What a great year he had.
How about Antonio Brown too.
One of the top receivers in the game.
He's such a big target.
They're all around offense is powerful.
They could start out 5-0.
Who do they play the first five games.
They play Cleveland,Minnesota,Chicago,Baltimore and the Jaguars before they face anybody good.
I see your point.
Then they get the chiefs.
Don't they play New England too?
Yes,in week 15.
Wow,that could be a huge game.
It could be for home,field throughout the playoffs.
