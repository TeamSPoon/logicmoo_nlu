Have you seen any good 80's movies

Have you watched lately
yes I just watched The Breakfast Club
What is that one about
it is about a group of kids that have weekend detention, they are all different and find their similarities during their ordeal
who plays in it
Molly Ringwald, Emilio Estavez, Judd Nelson, Ally Sheedy, and some others
sounds fun
it is a really fun movie
is it a comedy?
comedy, pretty much but a coming of age style story as well
what is the rating
I am not sure
is there a lot of language in the movie
I dont remember language but there may be some
it sounds like a lot of fun, maybe something my older teen could watch
it is perfect for an older teen
sounds like something for the slepover my daughter is having this weekend
a perfect popcorn, sleep over flix
