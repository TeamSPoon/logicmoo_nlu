Are you a football fan?
Yes, but I worry about the long term health consequences of football.
But you're not playing, just watching!
I know, but I feel somewhat uncomfortable about supporting the sport.
What sort of health consequences?
Doctors and scientists have suggested that repeated small head injuries can be detrimental to players, leading to painful mental and physical symptoms.
Oh, that's terrible.
It's called chronic traumatic encephalopathy.
How do you know about this?
It's been in the news a lot recently. There was also a Hollywood dramatization of some of the early findings.
Wow, I had heard rumblings but had no idea it was so serious.
Yes, it is. Though I still follow the sport.
It's hard not to!
It is. And there are so few things that don't involve someone getting hurt or exploited at some level.
Sad but true. At least players are usually well compensated at the NFL level.
Though they also have relatively little freedom to move about as they please.
That's true. Sometimes teams seem to think they own the players.
It begins in college-- players are workers and deserve to be compensated as such.
Well, I agree with that. It's like a waiting game-- if you make it out of college the NFL will reward you if you are good enough.
And hopefully your health won't be sacrificed.
