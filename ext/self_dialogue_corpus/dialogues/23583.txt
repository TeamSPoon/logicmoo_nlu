Seen anything good at the theaters lately?
Well, I did see The Lovers a few nights ago.
How was it?
It was great! It was about this older married couple who were having troubles.
What kind of troubles?
Well, they were cheating on each other with other people and starting to form attachments with the other people. They were prepared to leave.
Did they?
Well, yeah sort of.
Sort of. What's that supposed to mean? Did they leave or not?
Eventually they did. But then they got together on the side and were cheating on their new partners with one another!
I guess that's kind of a happy ending?
Yeah, I think they decided that they really liked cheating. So, how about you? See anything good?
No, I haven't. I'm really waiting for Star Wars.
You mean The Last Jedi?
Yes, that's the one.
I haven't been following the newer Star Wars movies. What is there to anticipate?
We could find out what finally happens to Luke Skywalker and the Jedi.
That would be exciting, I guess. Should I see it?
Yeah, definitely.
Okay, maybe I will.
