You ever listen to Celine Dion?
I can't really stand her.
Really, I always loved her music.
Honestly, I always thought all her music was overplayed.
What song was overplayed?
A lot of them, especially the one from Titanic.
Okay, maybe that one was overplayed, but it's a great song.
It's too sappy.
Maybe it's that kind of music you don't like.
Maybe so.  I really don't like her voice though.
