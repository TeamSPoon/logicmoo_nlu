Who do you think is the best musician ever?
I think that is Micheal Jackson hands down.
That is a pretty good choice actually.
He had great music and he was a great performer.
That is true, he certainly could put on a show.
That is not to mention how many records he sold.
Do you think anyone is even close to him?
Maybe The Beatles or possibly Elvis. However,  I would still give it to Jackson.
Do you personally like any of his songs?
I like a lot of them actually, including The Man In The Mirror.
I agree that was a really good song.
Have you ever heard Black Or White?
I think so, my mom used to listen to a lot of his songs.
Another song that I love from him is called Smooth Criminal.
I like that one as well. What songs would you say are his most popular?
I would have to say Thriller would be my pick.
Really? What about Billy Jean?
Oh yea, I actually forgot about that one!
He had so many hits that it is really hard to pick.
That is true. His music will stand the test of time.
