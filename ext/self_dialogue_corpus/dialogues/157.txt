You think they'll make another Iron Man.
Not sure. Probably.
I'll bet they'll reboot it.
Oh man! I can't imagine anyone but Downey in the role.
He'll be a tough act to follow.
What about an Iron Woman?
That'd be interesting.
Not sure I'd like it.
Maybe they should do a War Machine movie.
I'd pay to see that!
