I just saw Marry Poppins.
Cool.  Julie Andrews?
Yes, with Dick Van Dyke and Glynis Johns.
I loved the song  "Chim Chim Cher-ee".
I liked "A Spoonful of Sugar" and "Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious".
I wasn't keen on Dick Van Dyke's attempt at an English accent.
Neither was I.  He could sing and dance well, though.
What happens in the end?
Mary Poppins goes back up into the sky.
Cool.
