indie pop is so much better than radio pop
i have to agree
like, all the best pop artists started as indie pop artists
give some examples!
halsey, lorde, like come on...the list writes itself. even calvin was small before he got huge
so whats the difference between pop and indie pop?
production value and authenticity. it's someone writing a song versus a team writing a song
so beyonce isn't indie pop
not even close. sure, she kind of writes her songs but...not
not really, yeah. she just rearranges other people's lyrics, really.
