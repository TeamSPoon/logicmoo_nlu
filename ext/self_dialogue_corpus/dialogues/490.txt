Will the Oakland Raiders be any good next season?
It depends on how Derek Carr plays next year.
He had a great season.
Yeah he seems to get better every year.
He kept his number of interceptions very low this season.
That is a good stat to focus on.
It can win you games if you limit interceptions.
Exactly especially if your team causes the other team to turnover a lot.
In that scenario it is almost a guaranteed win.
Do you think Derek will win a Superbowl before his career is over?
I sure hope he does.
I know he really deserves it.
A lot of players deserve it but not all of them always reach that milestone.
Yeah then meanwhile some players reach it five times or more in their career.
It really is all luck and chemistry.
I agree if a lucky talented team has good chemistry they have an amazing chance at winning the Superbowl.
Unless there is a good enough team to overpower any of the luck.
I am so curious how next season will play out.
Yeah I'll definitely be wanting to see how Derek Carr plays.
Same here we can watch together!
