Am I the only one that hated Aladdin?
Why did you hate Aladdin?
I just didn't think it was that good.  It was annoying actually.
What part?  You mean the Genie?
Yes, the Genie.  Robin Williams got on my nerves.
He was over the top, but that was the point.
I have to admit, I did dig those songs.
I remember hearing 'A Whole New World' at my middle school dance.
My goodness, we are some old folks.
Who know our Disney, mind you!
