What is your favorite Scary Kids Scaring Kids song?
I am not familiar with them
Oh OK, they are a rock band from Arizona
Yeah still doesnt sound familiar.
How about Jimmy Eat World?
I love them!
They are also from Arizona
I love The Sweetness
That is probably one of my top 3 tracks.
So what is your favorite one?
Probably Goodbye Sky Harbor.
Thats another great single.
I dont think they ever released it as a single though.
Well either way its a phenomenal track.
They broke through the mainstream
Yeah they dont do much anymore though.
Why do you think that is?
I think they got what they needed.
So they got old?
They still make new music.
