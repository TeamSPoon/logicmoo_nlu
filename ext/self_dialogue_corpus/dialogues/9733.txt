Man you know who I miss? Eminem.
Oh for sure, I feel like he'll go down as one of the greatest.
You know how people call themselves 'stans'? It comes from Eminem's song 'Stan,' about that crazy obsessed guy.
Woah, I didn't know that, I really like that song. Are you an Eminem stan?
I guess I could say that. You already know that classic line from 'Lose Yourself.'
His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms is heavy --
There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's Spaghetti.
Haha! Have you heard the song 'My Life' with Adam Levine and 50 Cent?
No, but that's a real weird trio.
Oh, well there's this line that goes - getting my tastebuds ready to wolf down this spaghetti or should I say this spa-GET EVEN. Man Eminem likes spaghetti.
