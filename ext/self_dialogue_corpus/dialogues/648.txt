Do you think the NFL should have more games?
I'm not sure why they would want that.
Well, there is always more money in 18 regular season games
That is true, but would the players  like Tom Brady allow it?
I am sure they could change the rules to make them happy.
How would that be possible?
Well, maybe the rosters could be expanded.
Is there enough talent to go around?
I think so.    After all most teams carry three quarterbacks now.
Really?     Give me an example.
Well, the Cowboys have Dak Prescott, Appleby and Rush.
OK, I guess that makes sense.
I think they could also change the rules to help out the players.
How would that work?
Well, maybe a rule that each player must be given a week off during the season.
How would that help things?
It would keep the amount of contact level, and a week of rest during the season.
Would the coaches go for that?
I think they might.     It would help everybody out to some extent.
Yes, I guess I agree, particularly if they reduce the preseason.
