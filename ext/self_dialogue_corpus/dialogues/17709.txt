Are you into Everclear at all?
They did "Wonderful," right? I thought that was a bit cheesy.
It was a little, but most people don't realize how different their earlier stuff is. You'd love their first two albums.
What are their first two albums?
World of Noise and Sparkle and Fade. It has that raw and heavy grunge sound.
Really, Everclear? I just think of "Everything to Everyone" when it comes to their earlier stuff.
That was off of their third album, So Much for the Afterglow. There are good songs on that one, but also some poppier stuff, too.
I've only heard some of their radio hits. I never checked out their albums.
Sparkle and Fade was their first album that went more mainstream, so it was recorded with some funding, but it still sounded quite raw and emotional.
Yeah, the singer must've come out of the gate swinging and then lost some of that edge.
Some of it's natural, I'm sure but World of Noise, while it doesn't sound as refined as Sparkle and Fade, is an interesting story on its own.
What's that album's story?
It was recorded in a friend's basement for $400.
Really? So they really hadn't made it yet.
Yeah, it's popular now, but they were unheard of outside of the local scene, I would imagine.
Where were they from?
Portland.
That makes sense. Portland really had that grungey sound in the 90s.
It was even grungier in World of Noise. The frontman was playing a guitar on a really used-up amp and they had to apply ice packs to it every time it'd start to overheat.
I wouldn't think about that with Everclear, but it makes sense. All those bands have to start somewhere.
