Did you ever listen to Queen?
I have a couple of their albums.
They are touring right now with Adam Lambert.
It's not the same without Freddy Mercury
I agree. He was a great rock singer
I love We Are the Champions.
That is good and so is Bohemian Rhapsody.
That is their best song ever.
Do you want to go to their concert?
I guess. It is still good rock music after all.
