Hey, I am so excited about the upcoming season for the Chiefs. How about you?
Absolutely, they did great last year.
I know, I would love to see them in the playoffs again this year.
Me too, but they never seem to win playoff games.
Yeah, but Andy Reid has been great for the team and I think they are headed in the right direction.
I agree, I am just concerned about some of the players we lost in the off season.
That is concerning, but I am thinking that they will get some great players.
I hope so I would love to see them with a winning record and with a trip to the playoffs.
I think we should try to go to some games this year.
Absolutely, I hope they are playing the Detroit Lions this year I would love to see that game.
Me too, last time they played it was in London.
I know I was bummed I couldn't go.
I don't think they play them this year, because they are different divisions it only happens every 3-4 years.
That is a bummer.
I can't wait to go see them play anytime!
I love Arrowhead Stadium, it is the loudest in the NFL and it is an amazing experience.
I love it too, it gets my blood pumping just walking in there.
I think we should wait and go in November or December, it will give them time to find their groove.
I agree, let's do it.
Maybe they will play on Thanksgiving, that would be a fun game.
