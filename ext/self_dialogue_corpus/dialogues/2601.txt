Hey who is your team this year?
Oh you know I got the Panthers!
What makes you say that?
They almost went perfect two years ago, had a slight hiccup last year.
I'd say more than a hiccup.
They had a bad year, but Benjamin will be back, and Mccaffery could be what the team needs.
Yeah I admit Christian could be a stud.
He'll fill that slot WR or RB position, and no Linebacker will be able to cover him.
Yeah he is going to seriously create some matchup problems.
Plus with Greg Olsen still in his prime. The offense will be unstoppable.
I think it all depends on Cam.
Yeah you got to hope that he has a good attitude, and stays that way.
Yeah, I just didn't like what I saw from him in the Super Bowl two years ago when the Broncos beat them.
Yeah that play where he didn't really go after the ball I think was a real bad look for him.
I think you just gotta hope that Ron Rivera keeps them playing well.
Yeah he's a really good coach that doesn't get enough credit.
He's done so much for that team.
I don't know, with guys like Kuechly and Cam running the team, he should be doing better.
I guess i can agree with that. we've got some players in their prime that aren't gonna be great forever.
Yeah, and guys like Kuechly, you never know if he's played his last snap due to injury.
