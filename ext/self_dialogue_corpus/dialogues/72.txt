What did you think of Captain America: Civil War?
I thought it was great.
It had a great cast, and is probably the best ensemble superhero movie in history.
I agree with that. They did well with such a large cast of characters and not losing the viewer with too many stories.
Everyone got their moment to shine, but Spider-man was probably the crowning glory of the movie.
I really like the new Peter Parker. I'm looking forward to the next Spider-man movie.
He played well off of Robert Downey Jr.
And the big fight scene between the two factions in the middle of the movie was outstanding.
Great action and great interplay between the heroes.
I saw X-Men: Apocalypse right after this, and it couldn't really compete at all. Marvel is just too good at what they do.
