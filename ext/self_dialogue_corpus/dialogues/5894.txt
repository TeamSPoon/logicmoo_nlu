So which do you think was sadder, The Lion King or Bambi?
Wow, tough questions! They're both tear-jerkers.
I feel like in The Lion King it's more unexpected when Simba's father dies.
Maybe so, but both of them make you cry.
They're both great movies, too.
The animation in The Lion King is a lot more sophisticated.
True, but Bambi is still worth watching.
Oh, definitely! And Thumper is still funny.
Honestly, the two movies have a lot in common.
They're both about nature, and about the circle of life.
