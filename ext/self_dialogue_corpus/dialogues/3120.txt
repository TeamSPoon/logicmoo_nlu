What do you like about football?
NFL or college football?
NFL
Oh, good, because I prefer professional football to college football.
Why?
I don't know.  Calliber of play I suppose.
Is that it?
No. I guess it is also because I like getting to know the players and cheering for the same ones year after year.
Yeah, but so many of them move from team to team. Doesn't that bother you?
It used to bother me, but not anymore.  I watch many different teams,  and it is a delightful surprise when I find a player that I once liked on one team make a place for himself on a new team.
I guess it is like that in life...
You can say that again!  I have had four different jobs in 10 years.
Really?  Why?
The first company closed down, the second job was temporary, the third job was with a state agency that ran out of money, and the foruth was a start-up made out of others that had lost jobs in the horrible Obama economy.
Sounds rough.
Well, I learned something new at each company, met new friends, and stayed alive.
Are you employed now?
I'm trying to get a job with an NFL franchise.
You are too old to be a player!
True, and I was never good enough for the NFL, but I would wash towels just to be associated with my favorite franchise!
