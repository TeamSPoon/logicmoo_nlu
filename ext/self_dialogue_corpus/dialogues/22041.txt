Did you ever see the movie Hottub Time Machine with Adam Sandler?
Oh yes I did. That was funny.
Those guys all did a great job in that.
Yea, I like John Cusack, he's a good actor.
Yea there were a few good actors, like Crispon Glover and even Chevy Chase.
Chevy Chase is a funny man.
Yea, did you see part two.
No I didn't see that one.
It was good but I like the first one the best.
It was funny when they realized what time period they were in.
Yea with the funky clothes and big hair.
I would love to go back for a day or two.
Me too, just to have life be a little easier.
The music was good in the movie too.
Yea, the 1980's music is played in so many movies, even when it's not a flashback.
I will have to check out part two.
The same guys are in it.
Do they actually use the hot tub again?
Yes but go into the future.
I thought they would go back again.
