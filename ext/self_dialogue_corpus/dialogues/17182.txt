Have you ever heard of Ricky Nelson?
Of course I have.
Not sure if you did.
He was from the Ozzie and Harriet tv show.
That's right he was.
He used to sing at the end.
He usually did,yes.
It's late and poor little fool we're good.
How about traveling man.
Another good one.
I remember hello marylou quite well.
Wow big hit.
He really originated rockabilly music.
Yes,you're right.
Pretty much started in the fifties.
I think you're right.
He was a heartthrob.
Remember the song garden party?
Yes,it was about a time he played at Madison square garden.
He didn't go over with the crowd so well
