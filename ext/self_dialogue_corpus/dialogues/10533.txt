What's up?
Nothing much. You?
Same. Hey, you went to the movies this weekend right?
Yeah, with the family.
What'd you guys watch?
The new Pirates of the Caribbean movie.
Ohhh interesting. How was it?
Honestly, not that good.
No? Why?
It was just wayyyy too long.
I hate movies that are like that. Anything else?
Yeah, I felt like they really wasted Jack Sparrow in this one.
What do you mean?
He wasn't the main guy! He was essentially the drunken sidekick the whole time.
Was he at least funny though?
Yeah, in his usual way, but it just felt kind of cheap.
Huh. Does Orlando Bloom come back?
He actually does. The story revolves around his son though.
I guess that could be fun. Should I watch it?
Probably not in the theater. Save yourself some money.
