how do you compare lady gaga to katy perry?
well, first they both have bold approach to music, especially the way the music is presented
like dressing weird designed clothes all the time?
yea, that's part it
and obviously their names are both crispy and easy to pronounce and to remember?
oh that's true as well, It must be intentional, so people could remember easily
it makes sense. What's your favorite song from Lady Gaga?
There are multiple songs I like from gaga, including paprazzi, and poker face
oh, I love poker face, especially the music video
oh, it gives you a luxurious feeeling of being at a casino
