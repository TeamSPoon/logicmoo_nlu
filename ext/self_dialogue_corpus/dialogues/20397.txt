Didn't you just se the new Mummy movie with Tom Cruise?
I saw it a few days ago.
How did you like it compared to the original?
I think it started out good, but then I started to get bored in the middle.
How? There was so much action?
Too much. I thought they could have done more with the story line.
I liked the new version better.
How so?
The original one was too cheesy for me.
Oh I thought it had a lot of better humor.
Some of the humor was good like Brandon't Fraser's part.
What part didn't you like?
I think Jonathon's character was too over the top.
I thought he somewhat made the movie.
Oh I thought he was a lot of fun.
Which mummy did you prefer?
i actually liked the mummy in the original movie better.
I did, too. I think it had a better character development.
So do I, but that's the only part I thought was better.
Looks like we have different tastes when it comes to the Mummy movies.
