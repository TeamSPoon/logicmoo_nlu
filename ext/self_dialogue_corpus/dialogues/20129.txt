Have you seen the new Amy Schumer movie?
You mean Snatched? No, I haven't, but it looks really funny!
I know, right? It's got Goldie Hawn in it - I love Goldie Hawn.
Me too. Hawn and Schumer together - sounds terrific. They play a mother and daughter, right?
Yes. It's a comedy-adventure movie, lots of hijinks and shenanigans.
Nothing better than hijinks and shenanigans. Though to be honest I'd watch Goldie Hawn read the telephone book.
Haha! I agree! Ooh, also, it's got Kim Caramele in it.
I've never heard of her - is she a comedian?
Yes, and trust me, she's hilarious.
Well this movie sounds like a total must-see.
I agree! I've been dying to see it but everyone I know has already seen it and I hate going to the movies alone.
Well, I still haven't seen it - and at this point, if you go without me I'll be offended!
Haha - well, I wouldn't want to do that. Let's find a time to see it this week together, sound good?
Yes, sounds great! It's been forever since I've been to the movies.
Me too. And I think a good female buddy comedy would be the perfect way to break our dry spell.
Awesome, it's a date. Hey, out of curiosity, do you know who directed the movie?
Someone called Jonathan Levine. I've never heard of him, but with this cast, I'm willing to take the chance on a director I've never heard of.
No arguments from me. You want to go on Friday? I can order the tickets now on my phone.
Perfect. You get the tickets, I'll get the popcorn.
It's a date! Goldie Hawn and Amy Schumer, here we come!
