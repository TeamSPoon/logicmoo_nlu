Do you have any good movies you'd recommend?
Hmm, what do you like?
I tend to steer away from anythink dark, depressing or scary.
I might suggest Dan in Real Life. I've watched it several times already.
Who's in it?
Probably the most famous actors are Steve Carrell and Dane Cook.
I like Steve Carrel from The Office. What's the movie about?
Family, love, life, all that good stuff.
Is it a romance?
It is described as such. I personally find it funny and slightly depressing, but in a funny way.
How so?
Like, it's funny how pathetic the characters are and the depressing situations they're in. You get attached to them and sad when things don't go their way.
I don't know, that might be kind of sad for me.
If you like romances you might like it. But you have to not be in an already sensitive place to enjoy it.
I'll take heed. Maybe we should watch it together or have you seen it enough times already?
I don't think it's the type of movie you could ever see too many times. Plus, there's a great duet with Steve Carrell and Dane Cook doing "Let my love Open the Door"
I love that song!
It's a really heartwarming movie. I like to cozy up in the colder months and watch it.
Dan in Real Life it's called?
Yep, and it's got Britt Robertson in it which is a plus. I like her in it.
