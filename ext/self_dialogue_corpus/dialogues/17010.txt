Did you go to Boston Calling this year?
No, I wasn't super excited to see anyone and the tickets were expensive.
I really wanted to see Solange.
Was she good?
She actually cancelled last minute.
OH man, that sucks. Everyone I know who went was excited for her.
Yeah. They replaced her with Migos, but still.
Who else was there?
Chance the Rapper was the other big name.
How was he?
He was awesome -- it started raining when he came out, though, so people started leaving.
That's lame. It rained the one year i went too. They had to cancel Volcano Choir and went straight to Lorde and Childish Gambino.
Speaking of Lorde, have you heard her new album?
Not yet, i've just heard her new single.
It's on Spotify -- you should check it out!
I'm not sure I want to.
Fair. I think it's pretty good though.
I'm listening to Khalid at the moment, but I'll check it out once I'm ready to move on.
I think it's her best album yet.
She only has two -- it's not that hard.
