Do you like heavy metal music?
I don't like all of it, just the songs that ended up in top 40.
Like JUMP from Van Halen?
Yes, that one is an all time favorite.
First time I heard that one I was at a sweet sixteen party.
It is so danceable. I like to jump to it.
I love the keyboard in it.
I have tried to play it myself but unfortunately cannot.
I also like Wait by White Lion.
That is a great one. I really want to move to it. Wait, wait, I never had a chance to love you.
Boom, boom, boom. Now I only want to love you one more time.
Great lyrics, and a great tune.
How about Extreme?
More Than Words was a great song.
And it was unreal how it was so great with just the guitars.
You wouldn't think that the heavy metal bands could play so delicately.
Well it proves that they actually had musical talent.
Yes, they just weren't headbangers.
No they weren't. Some songs I guess the ballad style really were great.
Yes, now I want to go listen to them. Thanks!
