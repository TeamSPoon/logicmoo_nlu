I saw Wonder Woman the other night with my boyfriend.
How was it?
I thought it was pretty good, but not the best movie I've ever seen.
What's it even about?
Wonder Woman wants to stop the god of war so World War II ends basically.
That sounds kind of cool since it takes place during that time period.
Yeah, it was pretty good, but I think they could have done more with it.
Did you think the movie was too short or something?
No, I just felt like it was strange that she came from this weird island in the middle of nowhere. I don't get where Wonder Woman lived I guess.
I'll have to see it and let you know what I think.
