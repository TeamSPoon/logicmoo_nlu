Have you ever seen The Others?
I don't know.  Who was in it?
It had Nicole Kidman.
What was it about?
A woman and her kids are stuck in a house.
That doesn't sound exciting.
Well, the house is kind of haunted.
Oh, well that's different.
Yeah, and the kids can't leave the house because they are sensitive to light.
I see.  So, the whole movie takes place in the house.
