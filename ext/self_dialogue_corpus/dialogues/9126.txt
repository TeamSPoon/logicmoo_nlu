Rock music is stupid.
Oh, yeah? Studies show that rock music have the most intelligent lyrics of all types of music.
It just talks about sex, drugs, and partying-like all other music.
Listen to Rush. They don't deal in those types of lyrics. "The Pass" is a great example.
Why would I want to listen to people without talent and just make noise?
Rush's Alex Lifeson took a 5th century monastic tune and turned it into a melody for one of their songs. Neil Peart is regarded as one of the greatest rock drummers ever. Watch his solo videos.
All you talk about is Rush. What about all the others?
From Buddy Holly, to the Beatles, to Led Zeppelin, their music stands the test of time. Most other music (except country) won't be relatable in the next 5 years.
Well, it's all noise to me.
Just listen with an open ear and mind, and you'll laugh at the hiphop and rap stuff after a while.
