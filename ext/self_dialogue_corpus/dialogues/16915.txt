Have you ever wondered how or who picks movie music?
Movie music? You mean the sound track?
Yes. I have often thought it would be fun to have that job.
A soundtrack can really make or break a movie.
Not to mention generate more profit .
I think the music for Kill Bill and the sequel are so incredible. Tarantino has a way of gettng it just right.
Music is such a defining media for emotional reactions.
Even though  a lot of people got sick and tired of hearing My Heart Will Go On it definitely will forever be identified with that movie
That is true.
The same is true with commercials.
You get just that right catchy jingle and you are golden.
My husband and our then roommate used to love to drive me crazy by singing" tender crisp bacon cheddar" song from the burger king commercial. I hate that music.
Ah yes jingles from commercials. My mom said I knew a lot of jingles and would sing along at inappropriate times.
What do you mean inappropriate times?
Well like when the preacher would come by for a visit i would sing the Pabst Blue Ribbon Beer song.
Oh that's  hilarious!
Hey i didn't know there was anything wrong with doing that.
You are so special!
They shouldn't have done such a good job brainwashing me with their music.
I am sure it didn't take much!!  That brain of yours is like a sponge.
