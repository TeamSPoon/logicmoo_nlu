Who do you like better: Taylor Swift or Katy Perry?
I prefer Taylor, though honestly, I'm not a huge fan of either.
Really? Who do you like?
I'm really into Miley Cyrus.
I didn't know that! What do you think of her latest single?
"Malibu"?
Yeah, I haven't heard it yet, but it's supposed to be really good.
It is! I've been playing it on repeat for over a week!
Is it that club type music she was doing for a while?
No, it's more of a country inspired pop song. She's really getting back to her roots.
Oh, that's nice.
Yeah, I really feel like she's found herself over the past three years, both as an artist and a person.
Why do you say that?
I don't know how to explain it, but she just seems more like herself these days.
Is she putting out an album to go with the single?
I'm not sure, but I hope so! I can't wait to hear more from her.
Yeah, I've been meaning to check out the single, just haven't had a chance.
I can send you the YouTube link if you want.
That would be great!
I think you'll really like it.
