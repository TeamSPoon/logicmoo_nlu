Do you like Death Cab for Cutie?
Yeah, from what I've heard.  They don't get much airplay.
Did you think that that last Star Wars movie was as good as the others?
Definitely.  It was better that some of the others like Phantom Menace.
I remember watching the Talking Heads on Saturday Night Live.  Do you see that?
Are you sure they played on SNL?  I don't remember anything about that.
People were saying Hacksaw Ridge was a good as Saving Private Ryan.  I don't know.
Well, Hacksaw Ridge is a true story so that makes it better.
I really like the lead guitar that Pearl Jam had, what ever happened to him?
Pearl Jam is still around, I imagine he's still kicking.
I want to see a good movie.  Have you seen any lately?
I would recommend Alien Covenant if you're into sci-fi and aliens.
I really want to see Dunkirk.  Have you heard anything about it.
Not anyone that's seen it.  It doesn't come out until July.  Looks like it may be good.
Do you think the Rolling Stones will ever do another tour?
I bet the will until most of them are dead.  Keith Richards will never die.
I really want to see the Pixies, I wonder if they will ever play again.
I don't know.  If they get within 300 miles, I'm there.
Not another Transformer movie!  How many does that make?  Based on toys...
I'm not sure but a few.  They really aren't that bad but I'm not sure I want to pay $12 a ticket.
