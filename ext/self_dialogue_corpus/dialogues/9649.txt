Do you consider Iggy Azalea a rapper?
Yeah I would say she is
Fancy did not have that much rap lyrics in it.
Yeah that was to bridge her into the mainstream.
I mean she rapped some of the parts of it but not the entire thing.
I would consider her a white Nicki Minaj
Thats quite a comparison.
Not like minaj is anything special though.
I dont know I feel like they dont write their own lyrics
They definitely do not, they are performers.
