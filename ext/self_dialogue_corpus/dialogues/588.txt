Did you like the SUPERBOWL?
I didn't like who won,but I liked the game.
Not a patriots fan?
No I'm not.
I'm not either.
Who do you like?
I'm a Giants fan.
Only team New England can't beat in the SUPERBOWL.
That is correct.
What a tremendous comeback though in the SUPERBOWL.
I honestly thought it was over.
So did I.
To blow a lead like that after three quarters is pretty bad.
I think Atlanta kind of beat themselves.
Yea,some iffy play calling.
I also think they ran out of gas.
They might have.
They were flying all over in the first half.
They were all over New England.
It's like New England had no answer.
