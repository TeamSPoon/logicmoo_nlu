Who was the best rock artist of all time?
I would have to say, Elvis.
What? He is not a Rock guy.
He was one of the first, Rock and Roll.
Well, how about as of late?
Maybe Kurt Cobain.
He and Nirvana were really groundbreaking.
Teen Spirit is one of my favorite songs.
I like the way the mixed genres a bit.
Added just a bit of pop in with the rock.
