Do you have a favorite Disney princess?
Does Mulan count as a princess? I think she's my favorite.
I don't think Mulan is really a princess.
In that case, I choose Belle. I think she's a good influence.
Why is that?
She loves to read, and I think that's important.
I like Cinderella the best.
Cinderella's friendly, but she didn't really do anything.
Cinderella was hard working though, always doing chores for her step sisters and step mother.
Belle was an intellectual, though.
