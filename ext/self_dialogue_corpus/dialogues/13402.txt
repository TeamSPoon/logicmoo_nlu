Did you like the chances that were made to the Star Wars films?
I don't mind them, but the original should be out there still.
Yes, you cannot get a copy of it at all.
I liked the original because it looked more like a film.
Yeah and a lot of the characters were changed as well.
What did you like about the updates?
Nothing really. I thought it made the film worse.
Yes, I agree. Luckily there was not much to change about episode 5.
Yeah, that one is my favorite still.
I think Yoda makes that one amazing.
