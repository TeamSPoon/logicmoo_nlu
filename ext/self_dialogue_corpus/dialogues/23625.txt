Have you seen any good movies?
Yes I saw Moana
Oh wow! I wanted to see that!
Yeah I recommend it.
It looks likes a cute movie.
It was and it was perfect for children.
Would you see it again?
Definitely. We should see it sometime together.
I agree! For sure!
How about next weekend?
Sounds good.
What else have you seen?
The second kill bill.
Oh that doesn't sound appealing to me.
Why not?
I don't like action movies.
That is understandable.
Yeah.
Anyways it was a pleasure speaking to you.
Agreed,
