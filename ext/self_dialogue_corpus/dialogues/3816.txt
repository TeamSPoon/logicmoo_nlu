Do you remember that movie called Seven with Brad Pitt?
Wasn't Morgan Freedman in that?
Yeah, he was one of the cops. And Kevin Spacey was in it too.
Wasn't he the big bad?
Yeah, he makes a great bad guy.
I think Gwynneth Paltrow was in it too. I only remember she was Brad Pitt's girlfriend and they had a Weimaraner.
Isn't that a dog?
Yeah, but he didn't have big part. It was a good thriller movie.
I remember there was a lot of suspense.
I was kind of shocked at the end.
