What superhero movies are out this summer?
“Wonder Woman” came out earlier this month
I heard that it got good reviews and it wasn’t just for one gender, but that everybody liked it.
It did get good reviews.  I liked it and so did my date.
What time period is “Wonder Woman” set in?
It is in WW1.
Any others out already?
There is a “Capitan Underpants” one, but I am not sure if you consider that a superhero movie.
That is for children I assume since the books are for elementary and middle school kids, any others more for teens or adults?
The next “Guardians of the Galaxy” came out already.  It doesn’t have as many characters as the first one
I saw the first one and I liked it, so I will probably go see this one.
There is a transformer one that just came out, I am not sure if that is more children or for teens and adults.
I was never into the transformers.  What ones are coming up later in the summer?
Spiderman is in theaters in July. There are a bunch of superheroes coming out in the fall, including “Thor” and “Justice League”.
“Justice League” is Batman and Wonderwoman?
Yeah, and Flash and Aquaman.
Who are the bad guys in that one?
Steppenwolf is one of them.
When does “Justice League” open?
November 17.
