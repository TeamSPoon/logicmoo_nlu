How long before the NFL season kicks off?
Not exactly sure but can't wait, how about you?
You are so right!
I think we should see some preseason play in August don't you think?
Yep.
I just got my season tickets.
I wish I could afford season tickets.
Maybe you can come to a couple of games this season.
The ticket prices have gone through the roof.
I know and don't even bring up the $10 for a beer!
Does your better half watch any games?
No.  Unfortunately
My girl friend is a big fan.
That must be so cool.
I'm looking forward to seeing what Tom Brady can do this year.
Yeah.  He sure came through in the Superbowl.
The Falcons were an epic collapse in the last season SuperBowl weren't they?
You got that right. Embarrassing.
Who do you think will take it all this year?
It would be tough to go against the Patriots.
