Would you want to live in the world of Disney's Pinocchio?
What do you mean, a world in which a boy exists whose nose grows every time he lies?
Yeah, except the lying-nose growth connection would apply to everyone.
Wow, that would certainly be a way to get a good judgment of who you can trust.
Yeah, it's like a credit score for honesty that's all over your face.
Would the growth be proportionate to the lie?
What do you mean by that?
For example, if I tell a huge lie, that someone tried to kill me for example. Would my nose grow bigger than if I told a white lie about someone else's appearance.
Good distinction. Yeah, it would have to be that way for the nose growth to be any use.
Agreed, unless the growth is happening in real time.
