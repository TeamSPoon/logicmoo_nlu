Have you seen how much old school hip hop is making a comeback?
Yeah, the whole new wave of TuPac love.
I do not think Tupcac was ever not loved.
His songs really speak to me man.
I loved when he was in Digital Underground.
He was in a band?
Yes, back in the late 1980's and early 1990's/
Really, who else was in the band?
There was a guy called Humpty. They had a song called "All Around the World".
I heard that one, did not know it was Tupac in it.
