Are footballs really made out of the skin of pigs?
No,
Then why are they called pigskins?
There was a time when pigs bladders were used in footballs.
You're joking, right?
No I'm serious.
That's really gross.
I think so, too. But, then they were replaced with a type of rubber.
So no animals skins are in footballs?
Cow leather is used as the skins of the footballs.
I wonder how many cows are used to make footballs.
I read where it takes 600 cows a year to supply the skins for the footballs.
So then one lucky cow might actually have its skin make it to the Superbowl?
It could happen.
I wonder what the odds are.
The odds are 1 in 17,420,000.
Have you been reading up on football trivia again?
I confess that I have.
Well, you've come up with some interesting stuff.
Thank you!
