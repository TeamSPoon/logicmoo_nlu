Did you hear the Foo Fighters just announced a new album?
I think I did see that. What is the album name again?
Concrete and Gold.
Right. Yeah, I did hear about that and also the new tour too.
I'm excited. It seems like there just isn't much new rock music lately.
Yeah, they're definitely one of the few bands around right now to keep the genre alive.
Yeah, they're definitely the biggest rock band around currently, in my opinion.
I agree with that. Aside from maybe The Rolling Stones but the Stones don't really put out any new music.
Yeah, they just tour mostly.
At least they're all still iconic though!
