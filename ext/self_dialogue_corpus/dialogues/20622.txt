Have you seen any good movies lately?
No, not really. I saw Guardians of the Galaxy 2 in theater.
Oh, really? Did you like it?
It was alright. I didn't find it to be as great as everyone makes it out to be.
I thought it was great. Why aren't you a fan?
I found it to be mediocre. I wasn't really into the humor. I don't find characters giving attitude as humor. It seems lazy to me.
I don't know what you mean. What's an example?
When the Rocket Raccoon went on about Lazer Face. They made the same joke several times.
I thought it was hilarious. Doesn't seem like lazy writing to me.
Now that I think about it they kept using the same jokes over and over throughout the entire movie.
What's another one?
An example, is when Drax keeps laughing at things that aren't really funny and that's the joke.
It's just good fun and laughter is contagious, right?
Yeah, I guess. Another cheap joke is when Drax keeps insulting Mantis' physical appearance.
Come on, you have to love Groot though!
It doesn't seem like there's much to him other than he's cute.
Yes, he's adorable. What's not to love about him?
He doesn't do anything besides dance and be cute. I want to see some sort of character development in a movie otherwise it's not a story.
I think you're being harsh. You can find something positive in simplicity.
Maybe, I don't see why I'm being charged for a story when I'm only getting a picture. Honestly seems like a ripoff.
