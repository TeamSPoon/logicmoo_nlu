Do you like Bruce Springstien?
Who doesn't?  He's the Boss.
Yeah, such a great performer.  All these years and he's still one of the big concerts on the block.
I'd love to see one before he just gets over the hill.
Yeah me too.  So what songs do you like from him?
I really like Dancing in the Dark.
That's a good one.  Kind of has this feeling of getting through being underprivileged.
Yeah, I also like Born to Run.
One of the best songs he made.
Yeah, seems the older I get the more I like him.
Same here.  Like I understand the struggles in his music more.
You know what else was good?
Born in the USA for sure.
Yes, just what I was thinking.
I know, the subtlety of the song of both being grateful to be American but at the same time it's not as perfect as propaganda says.
Yeah, I would like to hear a new one with updated issues.
That would be pretty cool.
Like about the things that have gone on in our lives recently you know?
Yeah, seems other than the occasional country song no one really covers it anymore.
Yeah, I agree, and then it's usually sunshine and happiness.
