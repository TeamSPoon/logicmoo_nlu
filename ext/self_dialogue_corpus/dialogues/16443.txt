Who is the greatest rapper of all time?
That's easy, Eminem.
Can you say that with absolute certainty?
Yes, can't you?
No, there are a lot more options to consider.
Like who?
Tupac, Biggie etc...
Yea but, while they are legends, they cant hold a candle to Em lyrically.
Tupac was a poet, you cant deny that.
Yes he was and he is probably the second best of all time.
Oh come on! Second best?!?!
Second best.
Pac was involved int he community and meant something to Rap beyond a lyrical level, that has to count for something.
Eminem was beat as a kid and treated unfairly, does that count?
In a sense, but not as much as Pacs contributions to the community.
How so?
Well, would the culture of the black community have changed if Pac wasnt around?
I'm sure eventually.
Right, but did Eminem change the culture?
Touche my friend, touche.
