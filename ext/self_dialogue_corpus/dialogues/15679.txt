Is Madonna still creating new music?
I'm not sure.  If she is, she has to hold some record for her longevity in the business.
I know.  I can remember when she hit the airwaves in the early 80's.
Me, too.  What was the Madonna song you remember hearing?
I think it was Border Line, but I'm not 100% sure.
For me, it was "Holiday".  And, now, anytime I hear the song, I think of how it got butchered by Adam Sandler in "The Wedding Singer",
Wasn't there a song about an island?
La Isla Bonita?
Yeah!  My little sister ran around singing that for most of a summer.
Madonna was actually one of the examples my university used in a marketing class.
Oh yeah? How so?
Well, when she did a Pepsi commercial while singing "Like a Prayer", it actually had a backlash.  Religious groups were really angry because they thought the song was sacreiligious.
I vaguely remember that.
Yeah.  It created quite the scandal and ultimately, the company lost a lot of money.  But, the commercial is actually pretty well shot.
I could see that. Madonna has always put out great videos!
I agree.  What was your favorite video of hers?
Vogue!  I don't think I knew anyone who hadn't memorized the hand gestures from the chorus.
My favorite video was "MUSIC".  It was so lively and relevant.
Well, no one could say that she hasn't left her mark on the music world.
Very, very true!
