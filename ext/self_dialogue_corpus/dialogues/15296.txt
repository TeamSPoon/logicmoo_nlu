Have you heard any good bands lately?
Sure. What kind of music do you like?
I like indie and also some rap.
Okay well Phoenix has a great new single out.
Oh yeah? What is it called?
It's called Ti Amo and their music is really fun.
Okay I will check them out.
Cool. Definitely give their old music a listen too.
So how about some rap suggestions
Well I really like Kendrik Lamar, Migos and Childish Gambino right now.
I heard that Childish Gambino is doing one last album then retiring from music.
No way! that bums me out.
Yeah he is really talented.
I like how all of this stuff really changes.
Yeah, every album has a different emotion and feel to it.
I think that his newest stuff is really great.
He is finally enjoying mainstream success. I keep hearing "Redbone" on the radio.
Yeah it was in a movie and has become super popular.
Good for him.
Yeah his music is great.
