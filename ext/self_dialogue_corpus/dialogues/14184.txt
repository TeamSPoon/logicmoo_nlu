Remember when gaga was on top of the world?
she used to be the biggest artist around.
now beyonce kinda took control of it.
beyonce has the crown now.
lady gaga stopped being in the spotlight.
and stopped making headlines just due to her outfit.
maybe thats what she needs to do again.
it did give her a lot of publication.
she is still doing her thing though.
yup. joanne is a good album
