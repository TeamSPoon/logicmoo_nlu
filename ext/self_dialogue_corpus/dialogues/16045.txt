How is your day going?
It is going good, I have just been listening to music all day.
What all have you been listening to?
A little bit of everything really.
I love listening to ninety`S music.
Me to! It was so awesome back then.
I agree! So many great artists` were introduced during that decade.
Justin Timberlake and Brittany Spears come to mind.
Yes they both had hits that we all remember to this day.
I also used to be a big fan of Celine Dion.
She had a few big hits of her own in that decade.
My favirote will always be My Heart Heart Will Go On.
Was that the featured song in the Titantic film?
It sure was!
I love song as well, a true classic.
What is your favirote song from that era ?
I would have to say Truly
