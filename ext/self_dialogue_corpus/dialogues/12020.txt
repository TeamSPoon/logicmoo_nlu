This Star Wars stuff, the movies, how do I watch them?
You mean in what order?
Yes, they are really confusing, the old ones, the new ones, the newer new ones.
Well, I would watch them how they were made to be watched, in order of release, the way the plot plays favors that order.
The plot, what is the plot, on a whole of all of them.
It is complex, but could be brought down to a fight between dark and light, good and evil. And lasers.
How so, I only know a little.
Well, the force is everything, in the movies, it is good, it is bad, it is all. All the films struggle with the aftermath of finding a balance of that.
Like the Luke guy trying to kill the Vader guy?
That, no that never happen, not really. He wanted to save Vader more than kill.
