Have you seen the movie Finding Dory?
I haven't. I want to, but haven't.
It's reallly good, you should check it out.
I loved Ellen DeGeneres as Dory in Finding Nemo, I bet I'd love Finding Dory.
Yes, if you liked the first you will love the second. What Disney movies do you like?
A lot of them, Disney productions are always great. Bambi is one of my favorites.
Really? I have trouble watching that. It always makes me cry.
It is hard to watch Bambi's Mother get shot, but I love all of the little animals.
Flower the Skunk is so cute, and Thumper is too.
Yes, they're two of my favorites. I also love the song "April Showers" that plays in the movie.
