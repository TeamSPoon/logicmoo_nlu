So I was listening to Amber Run the other day
I don't think I've ever heard of them.
They're an Indie pop band from the UK, they've had a few singles in the US recently.
Weird, I normally consider myself up on the indie scene. Any songs I might know?
Well, to tell the truth, I only just started listening to them--the one I like is called "I Found."
Hm, that actually sounds familiar. Is it a cappella?
No, but they did do a cover with the London voice singers or something.
Yeah, that's it! That's a great song, I loved it!
Oh awesome! I just discovered it last week.
I wish songs like that made the top 40 more often, more people should hear about it.
Well, I only heard about it because my sister's dancing to it.
Ballet?
No, it's a contemporary or lyrical piece, I think. I heard it and loved it.
Very cool; I stumbled upon the a cappella version on YouTube.
YouTube recommendations can have some great songs.
Agreed, sometimes I like the covers even more than the originals.
For sure. Anyway, Amber Run's cool, they have a few albums now.
Do you recommend any in particular?
5am is the only one I've heard songs from so far, and it's great.
Cool, I'll check it out!
