Do you have a favorite gaga album?
I really dig the fame monster.
is that even considered a real album?
I dont know. its kinda like an ep.
it was like a side piece or an extension of the fame
it had bad romance on it.
that song is a classic.
i did not even like it at first
it grew on you?
yes, it did.
