What is your favorite fantasy movie?
Probably the Harry Potter ones.
Me too. Do you like the Hobbit?
I guess but I prefer the books.
I usually prefer the books in any situation. That includes Harry Potter.
They keep remaking movies now. There are lots of books I'd like to see made but they just revamp old movies instead.
What's with that anyway? It's annoying.
I don't know but it is annoying, yes.
They keep redoing Disney especially.
That new Beauty and the Beast was OK without Emma Watson's auto tuned singing.
Ug, that.
I was horrified.
I hated the singing too.
The acting was OK. Emma was a good Belle.
I love her. She was a great Hermione too.
Absolutely. She brought that character to life for sure.
I knew she would when I heard she would be playing her.
I didn't know anything about her before she was Hermione.
I meant after I saw the first preview. She was great.
She was.
