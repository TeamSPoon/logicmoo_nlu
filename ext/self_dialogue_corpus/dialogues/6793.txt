Did you see Finding Dory?
Yes, I prefered Finding Nemo though.
I liked them both but I do think Finding Nemo was better.
Ellen was great as Dory.
Yes. I liked having the back story of what happened to Dory. Ellen was great.
My favorite part in Finding Nemo was when she was talking to the whale.
It was kind of sad though.
I think all Disney movies have sad parts.
The two movies aren't totally related though. I think I was expecting that.
I guess when I think about Finding Nemo, Dory does stick out.  Guess that is why they went that route.
