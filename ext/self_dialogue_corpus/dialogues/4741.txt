Are you a baseball fan like I am?
Yes I am!
What is your favorite team?
I would have to say the St. Louis Cardinals.
Me too! I have always supported them and they always do well.
They sure do, they win the world series often.
Who is your favorite player on the Cardinals team?
Well I would say Pujols but he left the team not long ago.
Yeah that was a shame, he was a good player
Do you know why he left the team?
No I do not, but I am happy that the Cardinals are still an amazing team without him.
Well that is because they have many other great players as well.
That is true, do you think they are going to win the next world series?
I sure do! I think that they have a really good chance this year.
I cannot believe the Cubs finally won it not too long ago.
Yeah that was amazing, nobody thought that they could pull it off.
Well they have always been rivals to the Cardinals and that helped them to get better.
I love the rivalries in baseball, it is one of my favorite parts.
Every team has their own rivals, drama makes anything more exciting.
It sure does as long as it isn't my own life that has drama!
