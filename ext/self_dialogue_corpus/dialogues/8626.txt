Are you a fan of classic rock?
I think so. The late 60s through the 80s is the best part of that subgenre.
You wouldn't go before that?
The 50s were too poppish. All of the good bands emerged during Vietnam.
Which one is your favorite?
I'd have to go with Jimi Hendrix.
I'm more of a Rolling Stones fan.
"Sympathy for the Devil," right?
That is their magnum opus.
I agree, but I'm partial to "All Along The Watchtower."
