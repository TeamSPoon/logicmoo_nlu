Who is your favorite NFL team?
I'm a Denver Bronco fan for life!
But Denver sucks!
But they don't!
They have no chance at the super bowl this year.
I dont care, i'm a fan win or lose.
Denver always chokes in the Super Bowl.
Well we have won three of them, they could never win again and they still would be my team.
Well I like winners.
Then your not a real fan, your just a band wagon fair weather fan.
So you dont think some can pick a team to root for in the super bowl?
Not if they didnt support that team all year long.
NFL Merhandising hates you!
Listen, I dont care!
Tom Brady was a way better quarterback than Elway.
That is probably true but debatable.
Steve Atwater was not as good as Ronnie Lott.
What is your deal? Who cares?
Dont you?
Im not, your a troll, your not even a real NFL fan.
