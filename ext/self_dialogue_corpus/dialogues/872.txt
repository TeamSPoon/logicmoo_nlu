Okay. But what about the other players, tho?
Some new ones are pretty dope.
Uhhh, like who?
Not sure.
Who do you think has the best offense so far?
Definitely the Patriots.
Then the defense?
Broncos, or the Packers.
Mehhh, I'd beg to differ.
How so?
Because there are so many good other players that can do better.
Like who?
One of the tight ends for the Giants. I forgot his name.
Who else?
Another guy who goes with the Ravens?
What about the Bengals?
None there.
And the Browns?
Meh, they're okay.
Wow, you have high standards.
