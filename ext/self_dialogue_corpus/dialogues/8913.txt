Who has been the biggest rock band of the 2000s decade?
Thats tough because there was an influx of artists at that time.
I could argue it was Creed.
And I could counter that with Nickelback.
Those arent 2 great bands though.
I know, System of a Down had a huge impact.
Toxicity was a big track in its day.
Yeah and then you could say other bands spawned off of that.
I guess Its tough to really nail down one specific band.
Unless you say Foo Fighters but that sounds lazy.
