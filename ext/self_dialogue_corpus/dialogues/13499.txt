Who is your favorite charater in Star Wars?
Princess Leia of course.
I love her too.
She's amazing, but now that Carrie Fisher is dead, I'm sad her character is gone.
So true, though she finished filming the next film before her death.
I'm so thankful for that.
Plus, I guess editors could use previously recorded footage of her like they did in Rogue One.
Yeah, they could, but it would be so weird.
I agree. I mean, she is dead.
Exactly. Hopefully, they'll find a great way to edit the story so her death makes sense, even if that's not what I want.
