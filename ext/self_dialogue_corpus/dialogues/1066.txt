Do you think Brian Dawkins should be in the hall of fame?
Yes that is someone who deserves it.
Why do you think he hasnt been inducted?
The writers for some reason do not like safeties
Why?
They just seem them as not elite cornerbacks who just have to tackle.
I mean thats just the position of a lineman if you think about it.
Well they have to rush the QB.
But we are in a passing league, all 4 secondary positions are important.
Yeah I think thats the truth for the most part.
So why no love for safeties?
There hasnt been a whole lot of great ones.
I like Polamalu will get in to and Ed Reed
Yeah they will have a decision to come to soon
I just dont see how Dawkins dominance doesnt get him in first time.
He played in an era with great safeties
He just had all the requisite skills for his position as well
He was a team leader
He was more than just that too
Yeah fans still wear his jersey proudly.
