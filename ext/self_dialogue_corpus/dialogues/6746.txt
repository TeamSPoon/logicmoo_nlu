What do you think about Disney buying Star Wars?
I think it's a good move. They have the money to do great things.
I'm sure the casting and graphics will be amazing.
Do you think it loses something by becoming so commercial?
I think it started to lose it's specialness when they did episodes 1-3.
Oh, come on! Episodes 2 and 3 were pretty good.
The dialogue was atrocious.
I think you have to step back and see it differently. Anakin and Padme were teenagers. Their angsty dialogue fits.
And then Padme dies in childbirth for no reason but a broken heart?
No, the Emperor sucked her life force to save Anakin.
