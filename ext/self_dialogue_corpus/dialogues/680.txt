EJ just got picked by the Bills.
I heard they grabbed him in the first round.
I don't understand how hey got picked before Geno.
I hear you. Geno would kill Manuel on the field.
Can you image what was going through Geno's head when EJ held that jersey up?
I can't imagine. He probably thought he'd get at least as much as EJ.
You know they pumped Geno up like he would get first round.
Maybe they all assumed New England would grab them.
Yeah, they probably didn't want to waste a pick they thought they wouldn't get.
Yeah, even Brees didn't get that short of a stick.
They did Flacco the same way.
If he starts enough games, he can be top tier after this contract.
He's young enough to bounce back on another team.
Geno may get less now, but he's on a better team.
Five years from now, Geno could easily get double what EJ makes five years from now.
It's a shame too. EJ's talent is wasted on the Bills.
The Bills wer better off spreading that money around.
They could have had a killer starting line up off the drafts alone.
How much longer does Flacco have on his contract?
I think 2 seasons left for Flacco.
