What are your thoughts on Lady Gaga's most recent album?
Aside from Perfect Illusion, it had too many ballads.
Really? I thought you liked the ballads, especially A Million Reasons.
No, that song makes me cringe.
Well then you must have a really good Poker Face.
That was funny. I prefer her older stuff more.
When you say older stuff, are you referring to Born This Way or all the way back to The Fame?
Definitely the The Fame. Just Dance is such a good song.
Yeah, although my favorite song from that Album is LoveGame.
I must have listened to that song and Paparazzi 1,000 times during the summer of 2009.
