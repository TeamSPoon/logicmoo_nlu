Logan really changed the trajectory of superhero films.
Do you think so?  It was an amazing film, but I am not sure if other superhero films will go the route of Logan.
I truly think that it will influence other films.  The relationship that Logan had with Professor Xavier and X-23 was touching.
It was.  I just don't know if movie studios are willing to take a risk to make their films more serious like Logan.
True.  I don't think that all superhero movies should have the tone but Logan, but it would work for some.
Ultimately, entertaining and amusing comic book films seem to do the best.  Deadpool was much more adult than other comic book films, but it still had a lot of humor.
Yes.  When compared to Deadpool, Logan didn't have much humor at all.
For me, I think that The Winter Soldier had a great balance of humor and seriousness.
That was a well-done movie.  It was essentially a political thriller.
I think if more movies had that tone, then the Hollywood box office would be happy.
