Who do you think will be the best rookie this year?
I don't know any of them.
Have you heard of Leonard Fournette?
Yes I have.
He played for LSU.
Is he a running back?
Yup.  A very good one.
Who will he be playing for?
He is with the Jacksonville Jaguars.
That is a bummer.
Yeah.  The team isn't great but he will be fun to watch.
I normally wouldn't watch a Jaguar game.
Me either, but because of him I might watch a couple.
I will wait to see it on the highlight reels.
That is one way to go about it.
Are there any other good rookies this year?
Dalvin Cook should be pretty good to.
Don't know who that is.
He is a running back that went to Minnesota.
I will keep the name in mind.
