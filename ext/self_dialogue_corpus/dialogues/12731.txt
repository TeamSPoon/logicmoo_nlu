What do you think of Chewie as a character in Star Wars.
I think he's simple yet.
Is that it?
Well I think he has a good heart and is an interesting character because of that.
He does the right things or tries to when he can.
Yes he does do the right thing most of the time.
Anything else?
He has an appearance most people would be afraid of.
That's true but he's not scary.
Not once you get to know him.
