The next match in on Saturday, are you going?
I'm not sure if I can afford tickets, how much are they and are you going?
I believe tickets are $50 each, yes I am going.
Oh that's not too expensive and I love the New York Rangers! I'll go to the game!
That's great! Hopefully the Rangers win.
The Rangers are way better than Ottawa Senators, their goalie has many more saves.
Yes he does, and I believe defense is the most important part of ice hockey.
I'm thinking of signing my son up for ice hockey, what do you think?
I think that's a great idea, start them while they're young!
Absolutely! I'm going to train him to be a goalie!
Maybe one day he'll play for the New York Knicks!
Yes, maybe we'll be watching him together!
I used to play ice hockey as a kid, that was a great experience!
Why did you stop playing?
I got too many knee injuries and had to hang up the stick.
That's too bad, what position did you play?
I played goalie, what a strange coincidence.
Yes that is very strange because we were just talking about the Rangers goalie!
I have to leave, see you Saturday at the Rangers game!
Yes, see you there!
