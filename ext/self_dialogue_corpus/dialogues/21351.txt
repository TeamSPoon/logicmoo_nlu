I was thinking about going to the cinema. Do you know if there are any good films playing?
It depends, what kind of movies do you like?
I want to see an action movie. I'm okay with any movie really, as long as it has a lot of action in it.
Oh no, I like comedies. Action movies are so over rated.
What are you talking about? There is nothing more enjoyable than a movie with crimes scenes and fighting--
Half the time you can tell it's all fake!
I must agree with you there. Some films do exaggerate a little bit.
A little bit! The actor falls from a 10 story building, lands on a car and walks away with a few scratches!
Okay, okay! I have seen some exaggerated scenes but they still get my adrenaline pumping.
Comedies are much more entertaining.
Well, yeah, but it also depends on the actor. I've seen some pretty bad comedy movies too!
I only watch the movie if I know that the actor is good and actually funny.
When I told my wife I was thinking about going to the cinema, she said she wants to take the kids.
In that case, you're definitely not going to watch an action movie.
Tell me about it! She's already looking for a good kid's movie. I hate cartoon movies!
I totally agree with you. Kid's films are always so silly and childish.
Last time we went I spent a fortune on snacks and the film was about a bunch of cartoon ants!
Maybe we could do a double family date...our wives can take the kids to a children's movie and we can watch a comedy!
You mean an ACTION film!!
Oh man! There's just no pleasing everyone, is there?
