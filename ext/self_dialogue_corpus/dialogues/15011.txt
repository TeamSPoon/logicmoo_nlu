I'm thinking of going to see that Baywatch movie. What do you think of The Rock as a comedy actor?
I think he can be funny. He was pretty good in Central Intelligence.
Really, you think so? I think Kevin Hart had more funny lines.
Of course Kevin Hart had more funny lines. He is actually a comedian. But The Rock did a good job too.
Yeah, I think you are right. He is still getting his comedy acting chops.
Central Intelligence was good because he got to focus mostly on being an action star, doing stunts and fight scenes.
But wasn't it funny to see him wearing that fat suit?
It looked so fake. I could never see Dwayne Johnson as being chubby.
That was part of what made it hilarious.
That and his jheri curl. It was also weird to see Kevin Hart trying to be a nerd.
