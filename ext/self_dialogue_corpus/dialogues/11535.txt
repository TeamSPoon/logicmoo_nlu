What's your favorite Beatles song?
It's so tough to pick just one - do you have one?
Probably 'Dear Prudence', but you're right, it's tough.
I have different favorites for different moods. Right now it's 'Helter Skelter'.
Paul McCartney's vocals are killer on that!
It's like really early heavy metal, I love it.
There was a couple of heavy tracks on 'The White Album'.
Yeah, and then such mellow and calm ones too.
Such a versatile band, it's amazing.
I'm not sure there's ever been a band as versatile as The Beatles.
