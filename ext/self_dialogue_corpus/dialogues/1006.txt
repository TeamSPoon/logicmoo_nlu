O.K., I've got one for you.  What was the greatest football team of all time?
Wow, that's tough.  I guess you start with the Miami Dolphins, only team to go undefeated.
Yeah, but that's going back to the seventies.  I think players are bigger, stronger, and faster now.
So you would eliminate the great Packer and Steeler teams of long ago even thought they were dominate in their eras?
I don't care about eras--if you lined the teams up against each other across the eras, who would win?
So the Steelers are out.
Probably, although Bradshaw, Swan, Harris--that's pretty impressive.
So the great 49er teams are out, too?
Well, not so fast--they played in the 80's and played modern football and Montana, Rice, and Lott with that defense--pretty tough.
Well, if you're going to consider the 80's, how about the '85 Bears.
I'll give them the greatest defense ever, but not enough offense to be the greatest team ever.
The team that probably should have been the greatest was the New England team that went undefeated until the Super Bowl.
Yeah, you could be right, but you can't be the greatest if you lose the Super Bowl.
And when you think of New England, you only think of Brady and Belechek.
I think you're right, although obviously they've had many great players.
You know I'm getting a headache--there's been Dallas and Seattle and the Giants and so many good teams.
Don't take it seriously--it's just for fun.
I know--well, what team would you pick?
Well, I'm biased towards the 49ers in the Montana years--I mean Steve Young is your backup, Bill Walsh your coach...
Yeah, pretty good choice.
