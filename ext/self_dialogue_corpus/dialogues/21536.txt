Did you see the new Wonder Woman movie?
Yes, I did, I went and saw it at the drive-in with my girlfriend a couple of days ago.
What did you think?
I loved it! It is probably the best movie thus far in the DC cinematic universe.
You think it was better than Suicide Squad and Batman vs Superman?
Oh, yes definitely. I found both of those movies to be underwhelming.
What did you like about Wonder Woman?
Unlike the other films you mentioned, Wonder Woman had a great plot and you really come to care bout the characters.
I agree, to be honest. I was on the edge of my seat.
Gal Gadot really impressed me, I was skeptical of her ability to carry such a huge blockbuster, but she did a great job.
Was there anything you didn't like?
Well, I would say that the films climax was a bit weak, and didn't fit with the rest of the film, but it was still fun to watch.
I can agree with that. I also didn't like that there wasn't a clear villain for most of the film.
Yeah, you didn't really know who to root against, but to me that's not necessarily a bad thing.
Does this make you more excited for future DC comics films?
I must say, I'm a little more into it now. Although I'm not going to set my expectations too high.
I understand that. I am really looking forward to Justice League, though.
Yes it will be fun, if nothing else.
I think if Gal Gadot and Ben Affleck deliver strong performances, the movie could be great.
Yes I'd prefer to see more Batman and Wonder Woman than Superman.
