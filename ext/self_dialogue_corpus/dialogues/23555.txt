What do you think about Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice?
Saw it, loved it.
I loved it too.  Went on a little too long I think.
Oh no!  I think it was timed right.
On the whole I really liked it.  It spoke to the dawn of their league, coming together.
Right.  Ben Affleck was a good Batman.
I thought so too.  He's a tough character to get right.
Such a rough background.  Affleck was downright moody.
Superman was okay.
Yeah.  Can't beat Christopher Reeves.
That Lois Lane, not so great though.
Me too! Totally miscast.
The highlight was Wonder Woman.
Gal Godot, right?
Yeah that's her.
She's great in the role.
A modern take on Wonder Woman.
She's not modern you know.  She's from the Amazon.
And really skilled.  I'd love her lasso.
She has her own movie coming soon.
