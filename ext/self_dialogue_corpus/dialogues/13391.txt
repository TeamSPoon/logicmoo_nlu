You know what's weird in Star Wars? People that support the Empire.
What's weird about rooting for the Empire?
I guess nothing, as long as you know they're pure evil. But some people try to justify it.
It's not that different from rooting for the Rebels. They both have legitimate reasons for doing what they do.
But that's the thing, they don't. The Empire is literally just Space Nazis.
At least you can say they're the legitimate government. Some Rebels are basically just terrorists, too.
Yes, there are some morally gray Rebels, but it's not like rooting for the Separatists over the Republic. The Empire is just evil through and through.
But the Separatists aren't evil?
Both sides are controlled by the same Sith Lord. They both have real reasons to fight, though it doesn't matter since they're both pawns.
I see what you're saying. In that case it doesn't matter who you root for since the end result is the same.
