Hey would you like to come and spend the night with me?
Sure, I have a lot of great movies that we could watch if you would like.
That sounds like a lot of fun. Do you have any funny ones?
I sure do, are you a fan of Chevy Chase?
My dad loves him! Which one of his do you have?
I have all of his in my collection. I thought about maybe bringing Nothing But Trouble.
I love that movie! I thought him and Demi Moore were awesome in that one.
They were, but did you know that Dan Aykroyd was also in the movie?
I do not remember him at all in that movie, are you sure?
Yes, he played the judge that was keeping them in the house.
I can not believe that I did not know that!
I am sure a lot of people did not know. John Candy was also in it.
I miss John Candy so much! His movies were a lot of fun.
I know, Only the Lonely is one of my favorite movies of all time.
That was a good one, have you ever seen Uncle Buck?
Only about 40 times!  That one was awesome,
I think John Candy and Chevy Chase are both legends.
I agree, they both have made a lot of great movies.
Comedy legends like those guys will never be forgotten.
I am just glad we can watch their films anytime we want!
