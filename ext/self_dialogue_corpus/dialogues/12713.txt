I gotta say, I don't think OSHA exists in the Star Wars universe.
Probably not, as it takes place "A long time ago" and in "A galaxy far, far, away."
True, but even though, I don't there's anything equivalent over there.  Think about how many structures you got that are built with HUGE bottomless shafts never to them.
Yeah, like Cloud City, the Death Star.
Yeah, I know, safety violations aplenty!
Course, I don't expect some place called "The Death Star" to be the most worker environment to being with.
Yeah, that's that's true. Then they got that thing in The Phantom Menace that's built by a huge pit, with NO safety rails or anything.
Yeah, but that have those rotating force field things.
Oh, don't even get me started on how ILLOGICAL those things were.
I won't.  I know how you get.
