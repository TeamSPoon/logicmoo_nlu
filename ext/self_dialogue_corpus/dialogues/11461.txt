You know, bands like the Beatles are still so applicable today.
Yes! I totally agree! Eleanor Rigby talks about how lonely people are when they are disconnected, and that's so true in our age of modern technology.
And Yesterday talks about longing for the past.
I find that song so much more beautiful now that I'm starting to get older.
What about Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds?
Ok, I'm not even sure I know what that song is about.
Which Beatles song do you think is the best then?
Help! for sure. It's catchy and describes relationships well.
For me, it's blackbird. So sweet and open.
That one is really good. It feels like it could be a follow up to She's Leaving Home.
