i was having a different thought
about what?
i was thinking instead of going to the pub why not we get a drink and buy 2 or 3 dvd and come watch at home.
hmm that's not a bad idea,would also see what Fred thinks about it.
ok please do and let me know.
i'll, but this all depends on what we would all agree to watch.
that's true though, with so many movies out this summer one is spoil with so many choices and this might differ to individuals.
nonetheless though we can all come to a concession.
true, let's see how it goes.
we can start by listing 5 possible movies and see if 3 of us can agree on 1 of the suggested.
hmm,trendy movies right now is "Tanker" "Count Me" "The Mummy" "Baby Driver" "Kong: Skull Island"
and which is your most preferable?
it should be "Kong: Skull Island" its the most talked about movie at the moment.
and that's the same movie i was contemplating to choose myself, i was checking the reviews in between and true its nothing but positive reviews.
i only have seen a little teaser before it was officially released and seems action packed.
it all boils down now to Fred if he would also love the idea to skip pub and also watch "Kong"
just hold on a bit let me just fill him in about the new arrangement. be right back.
alright then,i was to see him in couple of hours so would have explain to him in person then.
in that case i'll chill and let you hint him the new plan and what his take is.
sure, very possible we might even drop by your place.
