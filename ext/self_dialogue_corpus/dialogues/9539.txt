Do you like rap music
Yeah I dabble in it. Whos your favorite artist
I'm a fan of Biggie Smalls
Oh! I loved Hypnotized when it first came out. I even bought the CD
Thats a good song, Big Poppa is better though
what album is that on
I'm not sure of the original album, but its on his greatest hits album from 2007
I'll have to buy it so I can listen to more of his stuff
If you get the chance, try to listen to Juicy too. Its a fun track
I'll do that!
