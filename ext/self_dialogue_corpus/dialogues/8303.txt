What do think of when I say pop music?
I would say it is music that is popular.
So what about a band like Metallica.
I don't think they are pop music.
Metallica is a popular band.
I guess then I would say pop music is something else.
Do you think it's music that made for teens?
I would say pop music is more geared for teens but appeals to everybody.
Pop music is hard to define isn't it?
Yeah but I still think it's any music that is popular.
