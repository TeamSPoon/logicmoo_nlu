Hey, last night I went to the Mariners game.
Really? Nice. Who were they playing?
They were playing against their main rival.
Hmm, you must be talking about the Oakland A's then!
Exactly! You must be a true fan then if you know that!
Well yeah, I've been going to Mariners games since the Kingdome days!
Ahh yes, the good ole Kingdome! I actually kind of miss that place.
Yeah, me too, but Safeco field is much nice. You have to admit it.
I do. It's a great place to play baseball.
So anyway, I didn't catch the game last night. Did the M's win or what?
Oh yeah, it was a tight game for a while but then we broke out in the bottom of the seventh and scored 3 off a 3 run homer with 2 outs.
Nice, always good to beat the A's.
Yes it is. With that win we swept the series against them in Seattle.
Where did you sit?
Well, I have season tickets so I sit in the same spot which is just behind the visitors dugout, 4 rows deep.
You have season tickets? Hmm, I didn't know that! Very nice indeed. Is it worth it?
It is nice but only if you are going to making it to most games. If you can't make it then you are wasting your money.
Did you get any foul balls?
Nope, had one that came close but the guy behind me was a bit quicker.
Ahh, too bad. I remember one year I snagged a home run in left field with my bare hands, It was back in the Kingdome days. Seattle was playing against Minnesota and I was set up in left field for batting practice. I can't remember who it the homer but I know it was someone on the Twins. That was an epic day for me!
