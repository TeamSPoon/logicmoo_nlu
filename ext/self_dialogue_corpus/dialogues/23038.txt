They should re-release older movies.
I agree.  Can you imagine seeing John Wayne on the big screen in any of his movies.
That would be cool.  I saw Independence Day in theaters when it first came out.
I bet that was awesome.
It was.  Maybe they could re-release it and make it 3D like they did for Titanic.
Yeah, but they spent money to make Titanic 3D.
True, but I bet it would make money.
Do you think if they re-released the Superman movies with Christopher Reeve or the earlier Batman movies would interest anyone?
I think the Superman movies would.  However the earlier Batman movies pale in comparison to the ones Christopher Nolan did.
They are good but I thought Michael Keaton made a better Batman and Bruce Wayne.
So, is he your favorite Batman?
I think so.  I like Adam West in general but his Batman was just..
Know-it-all dingbat?
I wasn't going to go that far.  Oh and great pun.
Just thought of it.  Maybe I should have said Holy Dingbat.
What was up with saying holy this and holy that?  He never did that in the movies.
I guess to show how young he was or make him stand out.
Holy lame to the max
Eh, I'd work on that if I were you.
Maybe I should re-watch Batman and Robin.   Remember what real cheesy Batman is like.
