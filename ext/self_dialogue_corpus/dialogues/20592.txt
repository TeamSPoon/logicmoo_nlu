I wished we could do something fun.
Would you like to watch a movie?
Sure, do you have any good ones?
I have lots of family movies.
Are any of them from Disney?
Sure, do you like animated movies?
Not really, I do not care for those.
That is ok, have you ever seen the Santa Clause movies?
I saw the first one a long time ago.
You have not seen part two or three?
Nope, I would like to though.
They are really good. Tim Allen is great in them.
I actually love Tim Allen movies. What other ones do you have with him?
I have The Shaggy Dog as well.
I have never seen that one. Do you think I would like it?
I think it is really good. Especially if you are looking for something family oriented.
Is it anything like Homeward Bound?
Not really, it has a different plot all together.
Well I guess we will watch that one then.
Great, I hope you enjoy it!
