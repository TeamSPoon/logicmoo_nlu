Hey man, remember the nineties?
What about them?
The music, man. The music.
Oh, like grunge, and Ace of Base?
Yeah and the heavy stuff too.
Oh, heavy like Decide, Armageddon? Like that?
Maybe. Remember Tool?
Tool? What did they do?
They had those weird stop-motion videos.
The really scary ones?
Yeah, they soft of defy explanation.
I remember that song Sober, that was pretty cool.
Yeah that was from their first album. They were really good back then.
Yeah, whatever happened to them?
They're still around, I think. They haven't released a tape in a while, though.
A tape?
Yeah, they've sort of lost their edge too. They lean really sort of prog rock.
Yeah, maybe they just got older and rich and sort of last the aggression.
Yeah. Maybe it happens to all of us.
I know I'm not as abrasive and aggressive as I was on my first album.
