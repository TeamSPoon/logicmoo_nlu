What is your favorite album of the year so far?
I think Damn by Kendrick Lamar is the best to come out so far.
Yeah, I loved Damn. Some of his best songs, and the singles were all dope.
Totally, DNA and Humble are bumping. Whats your favorite album of the year so far?
I like Rocket by Alex G the best. I think its his best album too actually.
Oh yeah I forgot about Rocket, totally his best album.
Yeah the violins on some tracks are amazing. Sounds so good on Bobby.
Yeah, Bobby and Powerful Man too. Honestly the country sounding songs are the best one.
Agreed, but how can you not love Brick?
Yeah man Brick gets me crazy every time i hear it.
Yeah thats why I think its the best of the year. He blends so many different styles.
Yeah it actually might be better than Damn, Just cause I think To Pimp a Butterfly is better and probably Kendrick's best.
Yeah I love Damn but To Pimp a Butterfly is a masterpiece, Kendrick is the best rapper out right now though bar none.
Yeah agree, his flow is nicest of any rapper out now.
Yeah but if were talking a full year and not just 2017 than I'd have to say A Moon Shaped Pool was my favorite.
Oh obviously, thats one of my all time favorites. One of the best Radiohead albums.
Yeah and I think every Radiohead album is amazing.
Yeah they'll alway be my number one favorite band.
Same ever since I first listened to OK Computer I was hooked.
Yeah that was the same album that got me into them too.
