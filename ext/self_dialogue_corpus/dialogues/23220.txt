Have you seen the recent Fast and Furious movie yet?
Yes, I saw it in theaters, it was a lot of fun.
Was it filmed in a new location?
It starts out in Havana, Cuba but you have to watch it to find out where the rest of the movie takes place.
Ok, fair enough I don't want you to give me any spoilers.
It is really good. I think it might be my favorite along with the first one.
What number is this one.
The fast and furious that was just released is number 9: The Fate of the Furious.
Wow, I can't believe they are already at number nine. I heard there was a lot of drama recently with Michelle Rodriguez.
Really? What is the drama, she is one of my favorites in the franchise.
I heard that she was protesting how women are treated in the franchise and that they are not placed for lead characters.
I hope she does not leave, she is one of the only original characters left and I love her personality.
I know Paul Walker is no longer in the movies but is Vin Diesel.
Oh yes, Vin Diesel is still one of the main characters
Now with CGI they would be able to bring Paul Walker back.
O wow, I totally forgot about CGI. You are right, they can put Paul Walker back in the movies.
Where do you think the next movie will take place? They already have done so many cool places.
I am not sure but it is always a new culture. And they pick somewhere relevant, cool and exciting to see.
So do you want to watch the movie again with me? I will provide snacks and popcorn!
Sounds like a lot of fun. I will definitely watch it again with you.
