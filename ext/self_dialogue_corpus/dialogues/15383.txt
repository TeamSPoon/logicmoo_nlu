What are you working on for your blog?
I'm putting together a list of best albums of all time.
Really? What do you have so far?
Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band by the Beatles, of course.
Yeah, that goes without saying. What else?
Led Zeppelin IV
Isn't that the one with "Stairway to Heaven"?
Yep. Some of their other albums are really good, too, but I'm trying to only choose one for each artist.
Have you included any albums by Bob Dylan?
Not yet, though I was thinking that Blonde on Blonde would be a good one.
Oh, definitely. That's the best!
I'm adding Fleetwood Mac right now. Their Rumors album is a classic.
Good one! Make sure you add something by The Clash, too.
London Calling, definitely.
Oh, and Nevermind by Nirvana. That album changed my whole life!
You know, I saw them in concert back in 1993.
You're kidding!
Nope. It was one of the best shows I've ever been to.
Wow, I'm jealous. Did they do "About a Girl"?
Yes, they did!
