Oakland is going to enjoy having Marshawn lynch this season though.
Yea, its too bad that he left Seattle, but Oakland is getting a gamer.
Aren't you tired of Marshawn Lynch?
What you do you mean?
You know? His whole act.
Like not talking to the media? Retiring and coming back?
Yea, that stuff. It all has gotten old.
You know, I have thought about that too. His teammates seem to like him though.
Yea, I agree. His act is just getting really old.
Well, old or not he is gonna be an excellent addition to the raiders.
Yea, we already know they have their QB and lead receiver.
Yea, the only weak point on the offense last year was RB. They solved that.
I agree! Now they just have to keep their guys healthy and win.
Yea, it should finally be that time for the Raiders. They have a needed a QB to build around for a long time.
Yea, well they have one now in Carr. Or at least they paid him like one.
Yea, you are definitely right. That man got paid.
Lots of money he did. Lots of money.
Well, we'll see how that translates to the field.
Yea, well if Carr stays healthy, they are a superbowl contender.
I agree, but that seems to be a big if with him.
