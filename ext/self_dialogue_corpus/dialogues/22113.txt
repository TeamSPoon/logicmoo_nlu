Do you ever worry that your kids will think that the historical movies today are really what happened?
Yes!  Like that movie that Oliver Stone did, JFK?
Yes, Yes, I remember that with Kevin Costner?
That's the one, I loved that Joe Pecsi character that had those dark painted on eyebrows.
I saw a picture of the real man, he did look like that!
Really?  When we saw it at the movies, we were shocked.  It seemed like one big lie.
I believe that Stone did a lot of research on the subject before he made it.
Yeah, but I bet he put in a lot of "poetic license" to make it more Hollywood.
Gee, I would have thought there was enough drama based on the real story alone.
That was such a sad time wasn't it?  Well, at least it got my kids to see some real history.
Right, but isn't that my question, was it real history?  Sometimes my kids tell me things that are just plain wrong.
If they didn't see a Hollywood blockbuster they wouldn't know anything about back then.
History is important, I wish Hollywood would take their responsibility seriously.
As far as I know, Oliver Stone was deadly serious about it, he went on talk shows to argue his points
You mean promote the movie?
No, he really seemed passionate about his arguments
Did you know that congress actually opened an investigation after his movie?
No, I didn't know that.  Maybe I should find a copy and watch it again.
I bet the library has a copy of the movie you can watch with those wonderful extras now that they have DVDs
I guess even if they aren't accurate, movies get the conversation going again.
