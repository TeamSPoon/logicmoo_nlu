So, how have you been today?
I am good, just setting here listening to some music.
That sounds like fun, what are you listening to?
Right now I am jamming to Alison Krauss.
I just love her. She is so talented!
I agree, her music is so soothing.
What are your favorite songs of hers?
I love Oh, Atlanta, Broadway, and Sleep On.
I have heard Sleep On, but not the other two.
They are really good. Do you have a favorite by her?
Yes, I love Baby, Now That I Have Found You.
That is a great song! I love that one as well.
Another great one by her is In The Palm Of Your Hand.
I have not heard that one before!
You should find it online, you will love it.
Thank you, I will do that shortly!
Have you heard her sing When You Say Nothing At All?
Oh yes, I get emotional every time I hear that song.
I feel that she sings it just as good as Keith Whitley.
I agree, she certainly does it justice.
