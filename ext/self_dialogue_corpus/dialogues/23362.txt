I am so sick of lots of things right now?
What are you sick off?
I am currently sick of the fact that every time i go out it costs so much
What happened
I just went out and spent way to much
Gotta elaborate to me on this
Well i went to see a movie and the theater charged me an arm and a leg
Where did you go
To the one downtown
No wonder they charged you so much
That might be the reason
Was the movie good at least
It actually was not
Why do you say that
It was painfully mediocre to be honest
That is better than bad
I guess it is
What movie was it anyways
It was The wall
Eh based on trailers it did not look to good anyways.
