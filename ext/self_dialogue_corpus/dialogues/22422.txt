I think I am going to watch the Ghostbusters movies tonight. Have you ever seen them?
Oh I love them. Bill Murray cracks me up.
Yeah he is good. I think he is way underrated.
Have you seen the new remake with Melissa McCarthy?
No I haven't seen it yet, was it any good?
Well, I was a little weary of it at first but after I watched it I feel in love with it.
How close does it compare to the original?
Some things are the same and some are different. Melissa McCarthy is awesome in it though.
Yeah I like her pretty good. Have you ever seen The Heat with her and Sandra Bullock?
Yes it is one of my favorites.
Me to. I so wish they would make a part two to that one.
Yes, I definitely agree. I think those two have a great dynamic with one another.
Yea, I found myself laughing throughout the entire movie.
It was extremely funny but a little over the top with all the curse words.
Yeah I was pretty shocked with all of those at first.
Overall it was a good movie though. It is one that I could watch over and over again.
Yeah me to. She tends to have that affect on me to where I could watch any of her movies over and over.
What other movies of hers do you like?
I like Tammy, Identity Thief, Spy, and The Boss.
The Boss was awesome. She played her character very well
