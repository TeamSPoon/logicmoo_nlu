What do you think of disco music?
Well, I was always sort of trained to dislike it, by the larger culture of white, male rock fans.
You mean that crowd that turned out for Disco Demolition Night and blew up all those records?
Yeah, see, and the thing is that today we understand that anger as reactionary.
As homophobic and sexist too, right?
Right. Because some would say it's a white working-class uprising, but it's sinister in another way.
Sure. Well, disco music was diverse in terms of celebrating black, Latin, and queer identities.
The thing is, too, that punk was against disco too. You have lots of punk anti-disco anthems.
And they saw the music of disco as anonymous, and bland, and cheesy...
Which is a sort of reductionist argument, if you think about it. Look at something like Vaporwave today, which celebrates that.
And it finds a kind of eerie beauty in something like department store muzak.
So the music produced by disco was a lot more lush and, well, musical than people gave it credit for being.
Yes, if you listen to something like Larry Levan's Paradise Garage mixes...
You hear a very intricate sense of rhythm, and an expert rhythm section at work that learned its lessons from funk.
Even less "cool" disco like The Andrea True Connection's "More, More, More," well, there's some great funk and orchestration going on.
Sure, or something like Barry White and the recordings he did with Love Unlimited Orchestra.
Oh, I love that song... "Love's Theme," right?
Yeah, it's exquisite orchestral pop with a disco backing.
And my ears weren't really trained to think of that stuff as good until more recently.
Yeah, because disco was severely underrated by rock fans and critics.
