Hi.
Hello.
Are you a big fan of star wars?
I don't know about a big fan, but I have enjoyed some of the movies?
Which ones?
The newer ones have been really good to see in theaters.
What newer one do you like the most?
I enjoyed Rogue One quite a bit.
Why?
It had a darker, harder edge to it.  I really liked that.
