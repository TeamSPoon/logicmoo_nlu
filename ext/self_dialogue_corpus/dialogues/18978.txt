I read today that Weird Al Yankovich is getting a star on the Hollywood walk of fame.
I thought only actors got those?
No, all kinds of artists are eligible!
So he's getting a star for his musical achievements?
I mean, I think Amish Paradise is a great song.
It is. And he is a great satirist.
Yeah, I think a whole generation was raised laughing along with his music.
Okay, I can get on board. What other musicians have stars?
Well, I know the Beatles all have two--one as a band, and one for each of them as an individual.
They are larger than life. That makes sense.
I guess it depends on what matters to you, like, what makes a musician deserving of recognition?
Isn't it enough that you like them?
Yeah, but lots of people have to like them for them to get a star. It's crazy to me that it has taken Weird Al so long to get one.
Maybe he didn't care about getting one.
Maybe. But does Lady Gaga have one? Or Ke$ha?
I'm not sure.
Do you think they deserve them?
I think if Weird Al gets one, they probably should too.
He's probably parodied both of them already.
If not, it's only a matter of time.
