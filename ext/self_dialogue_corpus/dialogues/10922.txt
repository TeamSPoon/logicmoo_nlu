How about those Predators?
I think the Subban deal was huge.
Definitely and this just helps the franchise.
Glad to see Rinne having success.
He deserves it and so do those fans.
Yeah, Trotz really did.
Theyve had one GM Their entire existence.
Thats tremendous in todays game.
Sure is, and they play in a tough division.
Competing with Chicago sucks.
Yeah and theyve stayed afloat.
Laviolette though has a short shelf life.
That is correct but this GM shows patience because the owner has as well.
I agree, if they dont win the Cup I would be shocked.
Well Pittsburgh is still involved.
I dont know if they can sustain it against Ottawa.
Turris and Anderson have been incredible.
Yeah its a magic ride.
And how about Boucher finally getting there!
Uhh he did with Tampa
