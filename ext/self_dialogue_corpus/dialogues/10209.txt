Are you a fan of Kurt Russel?
Yes I am. He is great.
Have you ever seen Big Trouble in Little China?
No I haven't. What is it about?
It is a supernatural action movie where Kurt Russel saves the world.
That sounds like my type of movie.
I think you would love it. Kurt uses his martial arts skills to fight wizards.
Wow. So he beats people even though they have magic?
Yes he does. That is what Kurt Russel does.
You are making me want to go on an 80's movie binge.
