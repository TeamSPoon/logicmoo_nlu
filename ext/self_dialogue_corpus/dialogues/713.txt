Hey Bart! Are you ready for some football?
Definitely!
Will this be the year that Buffalo finally goes all the way?
The Bills? No, they had their shot...
This is a whole new team compared tot he glory days.  Anything is possible!
Glory days?  Are you still talking about the Jim Kelly era?
Of course! Man, they were so close, so many times!
You mean they choked so many times!
That's not fair! If it weren't for one bad field goal attempt, the Bills would be known as an awesomely dominant, Superbowl champion franchise!
Instead of a perrenial choke artist?
Like you have any right to bad mouth my team!  If memory is correct, I don't think your Philadelphia Eagles are wearing any Superbowl rings!
Thst's the diference between Bills fans and Eagles fans...
How many times we've choked?
No. You Bills fans optimistically rally behind your team and hope for another dream season ending in victory...
Of course! That's what it means to be a fan!
Not an Eagles fans!
What's the diffference between an Eagles fan and a Bills fans?
Bills fans hope for the best, and then are let down at the end of the season.
Fair enough. And Eagles fans?
We expect the Eagles to choke in the end. When it happens, we all say, "I told you so" and get back to the party without skipping a beat!
