Do you like Billy Joel?
I do, he's pretty good.
Yeah, I would like to see the piano man style music come back.
Especially with today's alternative.
Yeah, he was like an early version of the coffee house style music.
You mean like Amos Lee and Jason Mraz.
Exactly like that.  They don't have the same performing chops as him though.
I do like their music quite a bit though.  Pretty good if  you ask me.
Yeah, they are great.  You know who else I like?
Who?
Of Monsters and Men.
Yeah, similar style.  But they are really good too.
I love little talks.
I wanted to see them in concert last year but I couldn't afford it.
That's too bad.
You know who else is good?
Fun.
Yep, exactly what I was about to say.
I haven't heard anything new from them lately.
Me either.  I hope I do soon I like them.
