Do you think the Vikings offensive line will be better this season?
Well they have Riley Reiff and Mike Remmers now so that should help a lot.
Reiff is a definite upgrade for the team.
Absolutely and they should be able to better protect their quarterback with a stronger line.
They were really weak at that last season. That's probably what led to a lot of their losses.
They're lucky Bradford wasn't injured they way he was getting sacked.
Well they also got Pat Elflein in the third round which should help.
They have put a lot of money into the team but they really didn't have a choice if the want to be competitive.
True and Bradford got sacked 37 times last season so they have to try to fix whatever the issue is there.
Do you think they will use all three as starters?
Reiff is definitely a starter and it looks like Remmers will be as well.
I think Elflein will have to prove himself as a backup first though.
Probably because he isn't well known and hasn't had any time in the NFL.
I would like to see their offensive line catch up with the talent of their defense.
Reiff working with Matt Kalil should make for a very strong offensive line.
As well as superior protection for their quarterback which is necessary.
Do you think T J Clemmings will be replaced?
More than likely after all of the sacks Clemmings allowed last year.
Well if their offense improves it will make for some interesting competition in the NFC.
As long as they can keep these guys healthy they should be in good shape.
