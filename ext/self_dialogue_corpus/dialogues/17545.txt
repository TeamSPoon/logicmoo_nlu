You ever hear of Jay Chou?
No, who is that?
He's a very famous and successful musician.
What does he do, I've never even heard of him.
He's actually Taiwanese, but he found some success in the US and Australia as well as some Asian countries.
Does he sing in English then?
Most of his songs aren't in English, but there's a huge appeal because his music is so good.
What's it like?
Well, it's kind of pop, he does a little bit of rap, that kind of thing.
Name one of his rap songs because I want to listen to it.
Well, it's not written in English but one of his rap songs, a softer rap, translates to "Wounds of War".
What is 'softer rap', what does that mean?
Basically, it's like a pop song with a piano, and it has some rapping in it, so it's not like gangster rap at all.
Well that's good and I'm wondering if that's why he's so famous.
I don't think it's just because of rap, I think it's because he's really good at what he does - he's a great musician.
Has he won anything?
He's been on Time magazine, that's pretty impressive.
Wow!  Has he won any awards?
He's won a ton of Asian music awards and he's sold like 30 million albums.
Nice!  I am going to check him out.
