What was the first song ever recorded by the Beatles?
Well, the first song they ever recorded was a cover of That'll be the Day. This was way back when they were known as The Quarrymen.
OK, but that was a cover. What about an original song? What was their first original release?
Well, that would be the song Love Me Do. It was released in 1962.
Which Beatle wrote that song, do you think?
I am pretty sure it was written by McCartney. I think I read somewhere that he wrote it in the late fifties when he was playing hooky from school!
It was an awesome song. It was released as a single with the song P.S. I Love You, which I didn't like as much.
Really? I love that song, too. Even though it was on the B side!
Yeah, well, the single only got to number 17 in the United Kingdom. When it as released in the United States, I think it got up to number 4.
Fans in the U.S. must have liked the songs a lot more than the Brits, then.
