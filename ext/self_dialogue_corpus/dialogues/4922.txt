Do you believe Barry Bonds will ever get inducted in the HOF?
He probably will at some point.
Why do you say that?
Some others who were suspected of steroid use made it in.
Who might that be?
Mike Piazza and Jeff Bagwell to name a few.
Do you think it will tarnish the HOF's reputation if some of these other guys get in?
I don't believe it will. The HOF is not for choir boys, but for outstanding players.
I guess you have a point. Guys like Bonds and Sosa were dominant even w/o steroids.
I believe over time people will forget about the other issues and realize how good there were.
Who is your favorite player of the "steroid era?"
Grifey Jr. by far.
He is one of my favorites too. Why is he yours?
I am a huge Mariners fan and watched him in his younger, glory days- so much fun to watch.
He was definitely infectious with that smile and the way he played.
Do you think he compares to anyone now?
Maybe Mike Trout- love watching him play. What about you?
I'm thinking the same guy- Trout is amazing.
Shame I don't like his team though.
Agreed...Go Mariners!!
