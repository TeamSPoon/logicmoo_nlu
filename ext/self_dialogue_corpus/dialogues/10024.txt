What's your favorite action movie?
I've always liked Die Hard.
Die Hard is one of my favorites too. Bruce Willis is awesome in that movie.
Did you know Arnold Schwarzenegger was originally offered the role of John McClane?
Really? I can't picture Arnold Schwarzenegger in Die Hard.
Me either. The role of John McClane was suited for Bruce Willis.
I agree. What other Bruce Willis movies do you like?
I liked The Jackal. It's also an action movie.
Isn't Richard Gere in that movie too?
Yes, Richard Gere plays the good guy, while Bruce Willis play the villain.
