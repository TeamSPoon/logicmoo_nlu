What do you think about comedy movies of today?
Not much. I don't really watch too many movies these days.
Why not?
Not much time. Not much interest, and the movie industry has become too commercialized.
I could see those things affecting your interest.
Also, movies were more thoughtful and comedies were more hilarious years ago.
How long ago?
I would say comedies from the 1980s and 1990s were much more thoughtful and funny than those that come out today.
What movies from that time come to mind?
Oh, I would say, movies like National Lampoons, Clerks, Office Space, Used Cars, and Dumb and Dumber.
I have never heard of used cars.
It was a little known 1980's movie about two brothers who had competing car lots.
That sounds kind of strange. Is it really that funny?
Oh, it's hilarious. You should really watch it whenever you have free time. You won't regret it.
What makes it so funny?
The brothers really take selling used cars to an extreme and go all out warfare on each other's competing car lots to out-do the others.
Sounds kind of funny. What else stands out that makes it a good comedy?
Some of the dialogue is unforgettable and there is an extreme amount of dry humor contained in the dialogue.
Dry humor. I should have known you would like movies with dry humor.
You know me well.
