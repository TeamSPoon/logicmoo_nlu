I really love the first Harry Potter movie. It's my favorite.
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone?
Yes, that one. Did you see it?
I did, it's great. Daniel Radcliffe was so young but delivered a great performance.
I was shocked that Professor Quirrell was working with Voldemort.
I was too, I thought it was Professor Snape the whole time.
The graphics were great in the movie. I loved the scene with the Troll.
It was great. I was grossed out when Harry put his wand into the Troll's nose though.
Yeah that was disgusting. Imagine if that were real life.
That'd be so gross.
