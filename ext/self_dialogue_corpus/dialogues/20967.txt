Did you see Wonder Woman?
No, I've been meaning to though! How did you like it?
I thought it was okay. If I'm being honest, the plot was a little predictable, so I wasn't as impressed as I might have been.
Yeah, I'm not super into superhero movies either. I'll probably watch it when it comes to Netflix.
Good idea. I recently saw Get Out as well, which I loved.
Me too! I really hope it wins some awards.
Same, it was honestly one of the best movies I've seen in a long time.
Allison Williams played her character so perfectly. It was scary.
I know! I've watched some of the interviews she given for the movie, and she talk about how unnerving it was to play that character.
I can imagine. I wonder who else they considered for that role.
You should listen to some of the Jordan Peele interviews too. His take on the movie is really interesting.
I will check those interviews out. What other movies have you seen recently?
My friend dragged me to Beauty and the Beast a month or so ago.
Oh, what did you think of it? I saw it right after it came out.
It is was pretty good. I've actually never seen the cartoon version, and didn't actually know how it ended!
That is amazing; it is a pretty predicable plot as well though.
True. The set was really beautiful though; I enjoyed it.
Definitely. I love Emma Watson.
She is the best. I almost felt like she was too good for the movie.
Yeah, I've heard other people say that too. I thought she did a good job though.
