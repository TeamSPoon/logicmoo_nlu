Do you like going to movie theaters to watch movies?
I have not been to a movie theater in quite a few years.
Why is that?
I prefer watching new movies at home where I can be comfortable.
That takes away from the feel of going to a movie theater though.
Well yes, but sometimes people can be really loud when I am trying to watch a movie.
Yes, sometimes, but it is not always like that.
I have thought about going to the theaters in the fall.
Is there anything you are going to see?
A new movie is coming out in September that I want to see.
Do you prefer watching Netflix movies when at home?
Yes, I think they have a great selection of movies.
I agree, they are pretty quick to add new movies to it as well.
That is how I have seen most new movies since I do not go to theaters much.
I think action movies are the best to watch in a movie theater.
Why is that?
Well, the sound is phenomenal, feels like it shakes you in your seat when some parts are intense.
That is one thing I do like, I must agree. The sound is amazing in a theater.
There are movies I have seen in theater that I enjoyed more than watching at home.
You're right on that, I need to go to the theaters more then!
