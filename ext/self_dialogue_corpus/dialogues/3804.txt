Did you ever see Kill Bill vol 1?

Yes, great homage to Asian thriller genre
Yeah, Quentin Tarantino does a great job of making movies
I liked Uma Thurman in that one especially
Ah yes, The Bride. She went through quite a lot in that one.

Yes and she was able to wear some pretty sweet outfits
Yeah, I liked that yellow and black motorcycle outfit
Definitely contrasted well with all that blood.
