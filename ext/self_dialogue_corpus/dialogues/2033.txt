Did you see that tackle
I did, I can't stop rewatching it
I can't believe how hard he hit that guy
I thought he was dead
he probably did to. I'm surprised he got up
I have never seen someone get hit that hard
Like a truck
his helmet flew halfway across the field
he probably has a concussion.
yeah, I hope he is okay, but what a hit
he didn't drop the ball though
I don't know how he held on to it
don't drop the baby
i guess not
that is going to be a top play for sure
yeah, be ready to see that clip again and again
I don't mind, I can watch it all day
this guy is crazy, he is going to go a long way
I need to draft him for my team
yeah, not if I do first.
