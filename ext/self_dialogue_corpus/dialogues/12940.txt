Remember the Lando Calirissan character from Star Wars?
Yeah, he was great.
Yeah, at first a swindler and city manager of Cloud city...
...and then a general in the end.
yeah, that seemed a bit of a stretch.
I guess the rebellion was pretty desperate for leaders.
I wonder whatever happened to him
Yeah, they never talked about him in the Force Awakens
I hope they somehow integrate him in the next new one
yeah, that would be great
