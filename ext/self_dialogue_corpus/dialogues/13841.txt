Did you ever listen to Red and Blue EP by Lady Gaga?
That album came out what year, it's been a while!
It came out in 2006.
What songs do you like on it?
Something Crazy and Wish You Were Here are fantastic in that album.
I will have to look up those songs online to listen to them.
I also liked Artpop as well in  2013.
I loved that album! Venus is the song I love off that album.
Aura is my favorite on that one too.
She tends to have blockbuster records over and over.
