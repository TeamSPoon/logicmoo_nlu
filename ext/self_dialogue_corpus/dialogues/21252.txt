Have you seen the new Guardians of the Galaxy movie?
Yes, it was amazing.
I thought it was better than the first one, you?
I'm not sure it was better. The first one was a real surprise.
True, but the action sequences were better in number two and you got to learn more about Nebula.
I guess, but I prefer Gamora. Zoe Saldana kicks butt.
Can you believe what they did with Chris Pratt's character?
I know, right. But the clues were all in the first one. We knew his father had to be an alien.
Who's your favorite of the Guardians?
Has to be Rocket. That guy cracks me up.
I know, hard to believe it's Bradley Cooper doing the voice.
I remember him from Alias, back in the day.
I think GOTG 2 may be the best Marvel movie they ever made.
Better than The Winter Soldier?
Tough call, but yes, I think so.
Better than Deadpool?
Technically NOT part of the MCU like Never Say Never Again and James Bond.
I get that, but it's still canon, just a slightly different universe.
Can you imagine how cool it would be to get Deadpool on screen with the Avengers?
It would probably get real messy, real fast.
