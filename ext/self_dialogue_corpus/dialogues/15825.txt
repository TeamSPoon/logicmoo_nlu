Do you like Smokey Robinson?
Do I? Man you got to be joking. Smokey is that dude.
I remember he had that hit Quiet Storm.
He had that and the one Cruisin'.
Remember that bull Deangelo did a remake of Cruisin'?
Yeah. That was like in 1995 or around that time.
Whatever happened to Deangelo?
I don't know but that first album of his was lit.
Remember the one Me and My Dreaming Eyes?
That one and Brown Sugar. Those two were my jams.
Yeah. That whole album was hot.
I think I got some Smoke AND Deangelo on my playlists.
Me too. I got Agony and Ecstasy on mine.
Oh, that's my jam. What's it all about, this crazy love...
You better know it. I be playing that one when I ride past my creep jawn's crib.
You ain't right. I like Ebony Eyes though.
Oh, you talking about Smokey and Rick James.
In deed I am. I got Ebony Eyes AND Fire and Desire  back to back on my playlist.
Man, Rick and Teena were the truth.
I swear to GOD I thought Teena Marie was black. That song Square Biz is a classic.
