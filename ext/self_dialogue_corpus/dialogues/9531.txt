What's the difference between rap and hip-hop? I so often confuse the two.
I know exactly what you mean. I think hip-hop is bit more upbeat.
Ok, so hip-hop is like rap that you can dance to?
Something like that! I would say Kanye West is an example of hip-hop music.
Ok, so kind of a middle ground between rap and pop.
Kanye, Eminem, 50 Cent are some good example of hip-hop music.
Many people would say all three of them are rappers....not hip-hop artists.
Hmmm, maybe you're asking the wrong person! I'm not an expert by any means.
I thought you loved rap.
I do love rap. I love rap and hip-hop. The more that I think about it, maybe they're just interchangeable names for the same thing.
