Do you remember  "Last Action Hero?"
Who could forget that movie?! It was Arnold Schwarzenegger's best role ever as far as I'm concerned.
I have to disagree with you there, I think his best role ever was "Terminator 2: Judgement Day."
That was a really good one, not as good as "Last Action Hero," but it was really good.
I think that if they'd had more time to work on it, it would have been a lot better.
I do agree with you on that point. The studio did them dirty.
I also think that because of that is why Arnold slowed down his acting career.
That makes sense. I'd be pretty discouraged if I were him.
At least he came back for "The Expendables." What a fantastic movie.
Yeah, I love that movie. Totally action packed!
