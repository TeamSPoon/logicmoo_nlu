What type of movies do you like?
I enjoy Horror movies a great deal.
I do to, have you heard anything about the movie Anabelle: Creation?
I have seen a few previews for it. It looks like a good movie.
Yes it does. Do you know who the director is?
I believe it is David F Sandberg.
I am not familiar with him.
I am not either, do you know the basis of the movie?
Yes, I believe a doll maker creates a doll named Anabelle, who becomes posessed.
Interesting a posessed doll, that is scary.
Yes, I believe the doll maker and his wife invite a few nuns and some young girls from the orphanage to live with them.
Maybe this will be a case of good, the nuns, vs evi, the posesses doll.
Could be, when is the release date?
It will be in theatres on August 11, 2017.
I think it is worth seeing.
I am also interested in seeing it, especially since I know from the trailers that the doll makers daughter met a tragic death.
Maybe she is the one who posesses the doll.
We will have to watch it to find out.
Would you like to go to the theatre with me on August 11 to see it?
Yes I would.
