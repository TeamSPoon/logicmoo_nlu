Do you like anything by Senses Fail?
I dont think I have ever heard of them
They had an EP called from the depths of dreams about 15 years ago
What label were they on?
Drive Thru Records to start
OH OK I may have heard of them
They are from New Jersey
OK I think I saw them tour with My Chemical Romance
Yes! They did do that for promotion.
OK yeah I do like them
They have a song called Steven.
Yes they scream goodbye, right?
Yes that is the song.
OK yeah they are pretty good
They fell off lyrically lately
Well its hard to keep a band up for that long
When its your profession you should be able to
We all have our strengths and weaknesses though
I understand but musicicans are different
We are all human beings
