I had to see North By Northwest for film class.
I never saw that one.
A Hitchcock classic.
Who was in it?
Cary Grant and Eva Marie Saint.
What was your favorite scene?
It's got to be the scene at Mount Rushmore.
What happens?
Cary and Eva get chased onto the presidential sculptures but they narrowly escape.
Sounds cool!
