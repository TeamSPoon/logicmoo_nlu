We havent talked much about the Steelers.
Yeah, they havent been too exciting as of late.
The only reason i think of Pittsburg is because Bradshaw is on Fox Sports.
Ha, true.
Thry got to face the Ravens and Lions this season.
Lions suck, no problem there.
Sorry, i meant the Titans.
Yeah, there a bit more formatable than the Lions.
Haha, true.
They got the Texans and a New England game also.
Now the New England game may show some sizzle.
Hopefully. They play mostly afternoon games or night games too, i hate that.
Sprcially if it is on a sunday. i hate when the NFL tries to go up against The Walking Dead!
HA, i know, they have LOST ratings to the dead before.
I know, not last year but the year before it was like three times in a row TWD beat out the NFL.
Unless it's the Bucs i'll watch TWD instead of football.
Same here or FTWD.
Well, i'll bounce the DVR to record FTWD and Talking afterwards especially if it's the Bucs or Miami
I think Tampa only played 2 night games and like 1 afternoon game.
I think so too, we didnt have many steaks during NFL last season.
