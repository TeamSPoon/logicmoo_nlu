Who is your favorite character in the Jungle Book?
I think King Louie is the best.
He is very funny.
I like Shere Khan.
Wow, he is very bad.
Yeah, but his voice was so cool.
Do you think it is cooler than Scar's from The Lion King?
I think so.
The Jungle Book is great.
Yes, it is one of the best cartoons ever made.
