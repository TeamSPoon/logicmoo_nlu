Are you a fan of rap music?
I used to be, but I don't really like many of the rappers of today.
Who is your current favorite rapper.
I would have to say Eminem, but he doesn't seem to come out with as much stuff as he used to.
How about the past? Who is your favorite rapper of all time?
I would have to say Tupac. He rarely made a song I didn't like.
I can't believe he died, but it did seem like they released a lot of music from him even after he died.
Some people think that he isn't dead and lives in South America.
That seems a little ridiculous to me. It's a shame that the Notorious B.I.G. and Tupac died too young.
They were definitely two of the best rappers of all time.
