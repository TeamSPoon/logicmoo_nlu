Did you see Assassin's Creed?
Yes, it was good.
I think it was great!
Where did you see it?
At the dollar theater in Allen Park.
How much did it cost?
It cost $1.50 because it was a night show.
Wow, you got me beat, I paid $7.50!
Yeah, I pwnd you!  That movie was awesome though.
Basically I agree, it was awesome.
They guy, Fassbender, he did a Shaolin straight right palm heel at one point when he was practicing his martial arts.
Yeah, I saw that, he got in the deep stance and extended his palm heel all slow, right?
Yeah, that movie was wild, how he evolved from a guy who didn't know what was up, to a guy who really was an Assassin.
Him and his dad were two of the people who didn't end up brain dead.
Yeah, and that black guy who kept calling him "pioneer".
A while after I saw the movie and it was no longer at the dollar show, was when I realized just how awesome it was.
Yeah, it kind of grows on you.
I was like, I wish it was still there, maybe I would take Rod to see it.
Yeah, or me haha!
Well, yeah, if you could schedule it!
