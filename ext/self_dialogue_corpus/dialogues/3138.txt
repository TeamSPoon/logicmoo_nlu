Why is the Pro Bowl so bad?
I think its a sport that doesnt lend itself to exhbition.
So how could they improve it?
They cannot
The other leagues found ways
Right but this is different
How so?
You cant get physical in football because of the risk.
Would guaranteeing contracts help that out?
No because they almost already do that with signing bonuses.
OK I see what you are saying
And I think that they just need to do away with it altogether.
Or maybe make it flag football?
Yeah that would be better as well.
I think people would tune into that.
Its tough because the game is so intense.
People do watch preseason games.
They do but tune out once the starters go out
Maybe add some silly elements to it?
They have to come up with something quickly or else people will completely write it off
