I watched that movie Hush last night. I loved it!
The one with the deaf girl who lives alone in a cabin in the woods?
Yes, that's the one! She gets stalked by a masked killer.
I really liked that one too! In fact, I was thinking of watching it again. It was really suspenseful.
I thought it was pretty amazing how they filmed the whole thing with hardly any dialogue.
I agree, it must be a really difficult challenge to make a film like that, especially for the actress.
Although to be honest, I think it probably caused other parts of the film to suffer.
Really? How so?
Well for example, they didn't do a great job with the back story of the killer.
Now that I think about it, you're right. He didn't have much motive. But it was still a very enjoyable film!
