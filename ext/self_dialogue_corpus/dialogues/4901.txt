Did you see the Nationals game?
No, I didn't.  What happened?
The bullpen blew another save.
Another one?  How many is that this year?
Too many.
That's for sure.
I think they have already blown four or five at least.
And have had several more that the offense bailed them out.
I wish they had made a better play for a closer this offseason.
Do they have any options now?
Internally, not really.  Everybody has been roughed up.
What about trades?
I think they would be very interested in that.
How much do you think they would have to give up?
I think it would depend upon who they are talking to.
Who is available?
I think the Royals closer, maybe the Rays or White Sox.
Didn't they try to go after the White Sox closer in the offseaon?
Supposedly, but nobody knows for sure.
Well hopefully they can find somebody good.
