I also think the Disney movies have an appeal for adults.
I agree. Some of the innuendos are very clever. The kids think they are funny but the adults understand the subtle underlying joke.
One of my favorite Disney movie that did this was Shrek.
I agree! I laughed so hard at some of the double meanings in the jokes.
I also love the voices. When I think of the actors like John Goodman that are the voice of an animated character, I just laugh.
I loved him and Billy Crystal as Sulley and Mike in Monsters, Inc.. They were so funny.
Their acting ability definitely comes through their voice.
I think the animation in the Disney movies has become remarkable. I remember when it was so simplistic like in the original Jungle Book.
I agree that the technical capabilities has come so far in just ten to fifteen years.
I think I enjoy them just as much as kids sometimes.
