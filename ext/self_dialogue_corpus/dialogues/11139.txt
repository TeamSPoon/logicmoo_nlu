I'm making my baby's clothes instead of buying them.
That's an interesting idea. It seems like no one does that anymore.
I like having control over fabric and style.
Are you good at it? I've never seen you sew.
I sew pretty well. I learned years ago.
Maybe you could design something for me to wear to my wedding then.
I surely could. Let's start now.
OK. First of all I like white for a wedding dress.
Good choice. Any particular style?
I like it to be tight at the top with a bell shaped skirt.
That sounds lovely.
And I'd like beading on the skirt.
Maybe pearls?
Maybe.
Or crystals?
I'm sure either would be fine.
Maybe you could have both.
That's what I'd like.
This is going to be a beautiful dress.
Thanks for helping with it.
