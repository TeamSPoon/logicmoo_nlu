What's up, man? You ready for this new football season?
I literally can't wait.
I know. It's been hard going without football for so long.
Tell me about it.
You know my Patriots have it this year, right?
Yeah, they looked good this offseason.
How do the 'Boys look?
I think we're your biggest competition.
Man, you know good and well, Brady would pick them apart.
We'll see, we'll see.
You know who else looks great this year?
Who?
NOT the Panthers!
Oh, man, that's cold. You know that's my second team!
I know. I'm just teasing you though, man.
I think Cam is going to be passing more this season. We'll see what happens.
Where do you want to watch the first game?
I'm not sure. Let me think about it.
Alrighty, that sounds good. Preseason will be here soon enough!
Oh, yeah. Ready to get some football in my life in some sense.
