Which dress do you think I should get? The pink one, or the blue one?
Depends where you plan to wear them.
How'd you mean?
Well, I wouldn't wear a pink dress to a chinese take-out; I love the stuff, I'd probably make a mess of the dress.
I see what you mean, it could get stains on it.
Right. Also, what where you thinking of wearing with them?
Well, I thought with the blue one I might wear brogues; and the pink one, trainers.
I meant in terms of, say, a cardigan; or...
Oh, of course. Well, I'm not certain, then. Maybe a poncho?
A poncho?... With which dress?
With either dress.
Oh dear.
''Oh dear?'' What's that supposed to mean?
Well, I don't think those items would suit one another well.
That response is a little more muted compared to your initial reaction. Do you doubt my fashion sense?
Well, yes; honestly.
I can't believe this. I thought we were friends.
We are, I'm just being honest with you.
Well you could have been a little nicer about it. You know I like to make a statement in my fashion choices.
Yes, yes. I know. Well what are friends for?
