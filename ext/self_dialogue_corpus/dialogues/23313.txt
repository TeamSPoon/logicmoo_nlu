My sister told me to watch the movie Keanu.
What is that?
A newer movie. It just came out last year.
Who is in it?
Jordan Peele and a bunch of other funny actors.
What is that about.
A mans cat is kidnapped.
So is it a comedy?
Yes. She said it is real funny.
I think I remember seeing commercials for that.
I think it just came out on DVD.
I'll have to check Redbox.
She went to the theatrer to see it. Said it was hilarious.
Well any movie with animals as a lead are usually good.
The picture of Keanu are cute.
So is that the cat's name or the man?
That would be the cat.
Does the guy go after the cat?
Yes, him and his friends I think.
Sound cute.
