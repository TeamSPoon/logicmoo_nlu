What are you listening to? I can hear it through your headphones but can't place it.
What!?!
Take off the headphones!!!
You don't have to yell. There, they're off now. What do you want?
What are you listening to?
It's a group called ELOY.
Never heard of them. Who are they?
Ask your dad. Oh, alright, I'll tell you. They're a progressive electronic new-wavy kind of rock band from the 80s.
Man, I wasn't even alive in the 80's. There was music back then?
Sure. The instruments were wooden but they made them work.
Instruments?
They're what people played music on before computers. Eloy was drums, guitar and heavy on the keyboards.
How do you hear the singer with all that noise?
Well, the idea is that the singer sings along with the music. They are integrated together.
Let me listen. Wow. That's trippy. It's hard to listen to. It confuses me.
Do I really want to ask? Alright. Why does it confuse you?
It's too busy. There's too many sounds at once.
You mean too many notes?
Yeah, that's it. What's a note?
Go boil your head.
