Hey, how do you think your Patriots are going to do this year?
Looking good. Brady is coming off one of the best years of his career and now we have Cooks!
Cooks does look like a great addition and adds something to the team. Who do you think will win it all?
I think the Pats are favourites but I have a feeling that the Raiders are going to challenge them in the AFC this year.
With Lynch, Carr and Cooper they arguably might have the best triple player offence in the league.
Brown, Bell and Roethlisburger from the Steelers might argue that!
Yeah thats a good tandom too! Some teams are loaded on offense.
Other aren't, like the Browns!
A Texans reject likely at QB in Osweiler, they look like they're going to have another rough year.
Pryor looked good last season, especially as he used to be a QB and not a WR.
Not good enough that he can win with Brock Osweiler throwing too him though!
With Osweiler gone from the Texans, how do you think Deshawn Watson will fair?
I think he will be difficult to face. Operating that duel threat of the pass and him running. He could be the next Wilson.
I don't think he will be anywhere near the level of Wilson.
Maybe not but he adds an extra dimension to the Texans and gives JJ Watt a better chance of a ring!
Man, JJ Watt is a monster. Think he gets the most sacks this year?
If he can stay healthy without a doubt.
He does struggle to stay fit.
You could say the same about Gronkowski!
Just wait till he lifts the Lombardi Trophy again this year! Just you wait!
