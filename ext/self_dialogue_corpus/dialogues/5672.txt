Did you ever see Sleeping Beauty?
Yes, used to rent it all the time as a child.
Me too. I used to love that movie
Animation was quite different vs today
Yes, style was very 1950s.
I think it still holds up to today's standards
Even more so in some ways.
Yeah, everything is so digital now-a-days
Agree, some of the old style animation is really neat to see now
Yes, they just don't make them like they used to.
