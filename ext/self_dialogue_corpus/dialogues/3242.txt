What lesser know horror film have you enjoyed and recommend?
Well I saw a film last year pretty indie but sort of known... It follows.
I have seen it. I t was good especially considering the budget.
I loved that it was filmed in Michigan my home state.
Oh that is always neat. To see a film where you know the area super well.
I also thought it was cool there were no opening credits like it just jumped right in.
I don't know if I had taken not e of that while watching. I did find it captivating.
Ya no opening credits and doesn't ever show the title of the film in it until the end.
Iwonder why he made that choice, maybe because of the impact It Follows could have at the end?
I think so, works so well with the entire movie plot.
