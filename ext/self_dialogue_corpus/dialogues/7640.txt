If you could use any of the spells from the Potter movies, which would you pick?
I'd like to have that invisibility cloak.
Not really a spell....
Hmmm...mabe the Leveosa spell.
Which?
The one that make stuff float.
Oh, yeah. Why?
So I could make myself fly.
What about a broom stick.
That'd work too.
