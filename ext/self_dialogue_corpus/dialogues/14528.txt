What have you thought of the NBA playoffs?
They've been great - the best teams are coming out, obviously.
Definitely, the Warriors and Cavs are really showing off what they have. No surprise, I suppose.
Yeah - I think it's going to be a rematch of the last two years.
It's hard to believe that those teams can remain on top for so long
Lebron really is showing off how good he is. He's only 32 and has three championships and been in four other finals?
Something like that. It's crazy. I thought Steph Curry would be the next one, but he's only three years younger than Lebron.
So do you think Lebron is the next Jordan?
No, that's impossible, but he could have even more of a legacy due to social media and stuff now.
It's shocking to see what younger kids are into and how influenced they are by social media.
So what team are you rooting for?
I'd like to see Lebron win again - but I don't really care about the team. What about you?
I don't care about the tournament as much, but it is interesting to see him win and win again.
The outspokenness of many of the league stars is shocking to me.
Yeah, it really comes out during the playoffs
Everyone seems to have their opinions and they are often out there.
It's a lot different than the NHL playoffs, which are going on at the same time, where the players specifically talk about the game to the media.
It's almost like the NBA players have a pre-made speech during their press conferences and only say what they want to, not answering questions.
I saw that Durant said to not watch the playoffs if people thought they were boring.
Yeah - that's shocking. I can't imagine one of your top players ever encouraging fans not to watch the playoffs.
