The other day I went to the movie theater and saw the new Disney movie Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man Tell No Tale. Did you see it already?
No I haven't seen it. Did you enjoyed it?
Yes I did. It was very entertaining. Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow did not disappoint.
I love his character. He really gets into his role and does a great job always.
Yes, he does. I also loved how everything ties in with the previous movies. When you see it you will see.
now I'm intrugued. I can't wait to see it.
you will be laughing so much your stomach will hurt. And the other characters are amazing too. Don't want to tell you too much, I'm afraid of reveling any spoilers.
Don't say anything else. This weekend is the perfect time to see it.
Go and i know you will enjoy this Pirates of the Caribbean. It's lots of fun and the CGI special effects are amazing. Have fun!
I certainly will and now even more after your great reviews. Thank you so much.
