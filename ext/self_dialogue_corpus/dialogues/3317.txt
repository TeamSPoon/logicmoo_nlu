Do you remember the Joss Whedon movie, Cabin in the Woods?
I love that movie!  It was so scary and unique.
I was so surprised when Chris Helmsworth's character died.
I wasn't expecting him to hit that invisible wall and fall to his death either.
It was great when all the bad guys got their revenge at the end.
Yes, it was strangely satisfying to see them attack the employees.
I felt bad that the world was ending though.
Well, yes, the ending indicated that we were all going to be destroyed.
I suppose not all movies can have a happy ending.
You never know, the day may have been saved somehow.
