Did you see that hot take about fielding rules?
Like, what, changes?
Possible changes to the ruleset.
Proposed, right?
Not officially.
So, it's like a casual discussion thing.
Absolutely.
What's the details of it?
Changing the rules for pop flies and homeruns.
What specifically with homeruns.
Changing the way umpires read balls the audience plays.
Interesting.
It's rare though.
I don't think I can remember a time the audience affected something seriously.
It doesn't happen so often.
It's a rare rule.
I guess that makes sense.
Yeah, same.
I'm ambivalent.
It's an ambivalent sport.
