Do you know much about the Star Wars films?
I'm afraid not.
Why not? Usually everyone loves Star Wars.
I just never got into it.
There's so much that you're missing out on. I recommend you watch at least one of them.
Which one? From what I know, there's a lot.
I would highly recommend The Empire Strikes Back. That one's a classic.
What's so special about it?
Well, you'd have to watch it to find out!
Fair enough.
