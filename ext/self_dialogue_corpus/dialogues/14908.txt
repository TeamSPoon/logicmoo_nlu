The best comedy of all time is Christmas Vacation. Don't you think?
Definitely. I love it.
I must have watched it at least fifty times.
At least. Cousin Eddie is the best.
I love it when he kidnaps Clarks boss.
Yeah, and takes him to the house.
It's also great when the old mans wig catches on fire.
That was hilarious.
That was Chevy Chase's best movie.
It was.
