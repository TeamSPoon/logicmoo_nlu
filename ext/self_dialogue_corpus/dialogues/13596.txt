Did you know Luke Skywalker is the bad guy in Star Wars?
What, no, he's the good guy.
He killed a bunch of innocent people.
No he didn't.
The Death Star was being rebuilt.
Yeah but it was full of bad guys.
No way they have that many storm troopers that are master builders, building the Death Star.
They had to have a few.
The Empire had to call in every contractor in the galaxy for something that big and Luke killed them.
Well, when you take a job on the Death Star you accept some risk.
