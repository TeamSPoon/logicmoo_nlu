In the new Star Wars movie, why is Klyo so crazy about a grandpa he never met.
They never really say, I imagine he thinks they have something in common.
Why? I mean he has powers but no one made him dark.
He is very powerful, but the dark side has more power.
So, maybe he wanted to have more power, make his grandpa proud.
Maybe, even though Vader turned good at the end.
He even visited Luke in a, what is that, a force ghost?
Yes, on Endorine. At the part, he did so that means he some how died a Jedi.
Even though he lived most his life as a sith.
He began the turn long before he got the mask.
