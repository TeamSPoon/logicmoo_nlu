I'm a huge New England Patriots fan.
Congratulations on the Super Bowl victory.
Thank you! What team do you like?
I like the Jags.
The Jacksonville Jaguars?
Yes, the Jacksonville Jaguars.
Do they still have Gabbart as their quarterback?
Yes, l think so.
What happened to Maurice Jones-Drew?
He went away in free agency.
Do they ever play the Buccaneers? Two teams playing from the same state!
They must have at one point.
Wasn't the coach of the Jags with Seattle at one point?
Gus Bradley? Yes, he was.
Is he still there?
No, he was fired. They gave him a few seasons but he couldn't make a winning record.
I'm sorry to hear that.
That's OK, he was a bad coach.
I hope they do well this year.
Thank you. I hope the Patriots do well as well.
