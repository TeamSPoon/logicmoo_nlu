When I was young my parents always took us to the drive-in movie theater when the Disney movies were playing.
Mine did too. We used to play on the swing set that was there.
We took a blanket and sat on the grass. There were six kids in my family so we could not hear if we were all in the car.
What ones did you go see?  I remember seeing Bambi.
I will never forget seeing Snow White and The Seven Dwarfs. I was so scared of the witch.
I was kind of scared of the Dwarfs.
That is so funny. We also saw Dumbo.
I saw Dumbo too. I saw Pinocchio.
Well come to think of it I was scared of my noise growing when I lied to my parents.
I felt the same way. I suppose that one had a good message for children.
