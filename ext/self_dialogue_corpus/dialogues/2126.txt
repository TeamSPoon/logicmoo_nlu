The Seahawks still have Russell Wilson though, and a great defense.
You're right, and their division is not very good.
I don't know, I think the Cardinals will be very good this season.
Yeah, but Carson Palmer fell off last year. If you don't have a good QB it's hard to be good.
But they still have David Johnson and Larry Fitzgerald, those are some of the best players.
Their defense has taken a real hit too. I think the Seahawks win the west, but they're not as good as the Cowboys.
The Cowboys are really going to rely on Dak Prescott being a great quarterback.
I think he is. He is better than the other guys in the division. Kirk Cousins is very overrated.
You're right. I think Dallas can win their division, but I don't think they're as good as the Seahawks or Falcons.
The Falcons are one of Seattle's biggest threats. They have an elite offense.
They did last year, but they got great years out of a lot of players.
They still have Julio Jones and Matt Ryan, the MVP, plus a great running game.
They do, but the NFC South is probably the best division, they don't have a  bad team.
I'm not convinced the Saints will be that good, but you're right it's a strong division.
The Saints have Peterson now. I think their running game will be very strong.
Adrian Peterson might be washed up. He's also always injured. I'm not sure he's enough to compete with the other teams in the division.
That's a good point. There's also the Packers in the North, they're always good.
I agree, the Packers are a strong team. So it looks like we've picked the division winners. Do you still think the Seahawks?
I do, I think they're a better team than Dallas, Green Bay or Atlanta, and they have the experience.
Yes, but Atlanta and Green Bay have both been to Super Bowls recently.
