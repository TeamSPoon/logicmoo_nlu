Are you going to go see the new King Arthur movie this weekend?
Yes I am. I can't wait to see it.
I absolutely love Charlie Hunham. He is such a great actor.
Yes he is I really miss him since Sons of Anarchy has been off the air.
Jude Law is in it too. In the trailer it looks like they have a great cast.
Jude Law is such a mysterious actor. I like him too.
Do you know how long the movie is?
I think online it said it is a little over two hours long.
I hope the movie does good at the box office. It looks so action packed.
I hope it does too. I think they made a mistake Charlie should have been the lead in Fifty Shades of Grey
I think it is a different story on excalibar
I do too. It will be interesting to see how it is.
I wonder if it is really violent during the battle scenes? Do you know what rating it has?
It has a PG-13 so you shouldn't be too gory
What day are you going to go see it?
I was thinking Sunday. The first night might be too crowded.
I was going to go with another friend of mine on Sunday too.
Do you want to sit together?
Yes we could do that what time do you want to meet in the lobby
How about 7 pm?
