Do you like the earlier Beatles' music or the latter?
Do you mean the songs they did before Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band?
Yes, do you prefer their style of music like they played on Ed Sullivan or the more lyrical music?
I actually prefer some of the music from Rubber Soul, especially Norwegian Wood.
Rubber Soul paved the way for Sgt. Pepper's, I think, and had a mix of the old sound with the new.
You're right about that. Drive My Car sounded like it could have been on the Help album.
Yes, but I think their later music was influenced by their trip to India.
Absolutely! Dear Prudence on the White Album was directly inspired by their experience there.
They had a wide-ranging, ground-breaking sound.
They certainly did. And their many innovations can be heard in more modern groups, like 1990's band Oasis.
