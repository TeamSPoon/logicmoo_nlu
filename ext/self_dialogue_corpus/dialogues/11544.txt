I was listening to Rain by the Beatles, earlier today.
Is that the one with the weird backwards vocals?
Yes, but it's not really that weird.
Really?
Yes, if you reverse it, it is basically just regular lyrics from the song.
That's actually kind of disappointing. I thought maybe it was about Paul being dead.
I sure if you tried hard enough you could tie it into the conspiricay.
Probably so. Anyway, I have always liked that song.
Me too. Ringo is really on top of his drum game with that one.
I agree. He was so underrated.
