I finally got around to seeing Casablanca for the first time.
I've heard of that I think but I don't really know anything about it.
Really? It's one of the best films ever made.
You hadn't seen it either until recently.
I knew the premise and the basic plot though.
So what's the setting of the movie?
Well it takes place in Morocco during World War II.
What side was Morocco on?
Well that part of Morocco was a French colony.
Didn't Germany take over France?
They occupied part of it, and a client government ruled the rest of it, so it's still French but somewhat compliant with Germany.
Ok, so what happens there?
Well Humphrey Bogart is an American expat who owns a club there, and a bunch of foreigners are in the city trying to get visas to leave and get to America, and then a woman he knew shows up.
What else happens?
I don't want to give you any spoilers.
Who else is in the movie?
Well, Ingrid Bergman is the only other name I'd expect you to recognize.
What else was she in?
She was in a lot of things, like Gaslight and Anastasia.
Oh right, I really need to watch more classic films.
