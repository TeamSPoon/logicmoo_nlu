How much do you like pop music?
I almost cant stand it.
I think its over-produced in a terrible way.
Yeah most of the tracks are filled with auto tune.
Most of them dont even write their own songs.
Or write their own music.
Yeah I mean how do you sing about something you didnt even pen?
I agree it takes out the true emotion that you want to hear.
I guess you could call them good actors.
Sometimes you wonder if they were hired for their looks only.
Well they are in the music industry, so they have good voices too.
Yeah I just dont see how people can get into that genre.
Its low hanging fruit for most of them.
Auto tune is ruining most of the track as well.
Why would they have ever brought that into production?
Some singers have the talent but they need something to put them over the top.
So its like steroids for musicians.
I wouldnt call them musicians
Thats true you have a point.
I just dont see how sounding inhumane would make fans like your music better
