Do you think Tom Brady is the greatest quarterback of all time?
As a Patriots fan, I'm probably biased so I'd say yes. It is hard to argue with five Super Bowls championships.
It seems like you are hesitant.
Well, I also recognize that the game is totally different now that for a Johnny Unitas or Joe Montana.
That's respectable.
Peyton and Favre also have a ton of records, but when it comes down to it, I think championships become the tiebreaker.
I think that's fair. I'm not a Patriots fan, but I think it's a hard argument to say that Brady isn't the best.
I agree in general, but I also look at the fact that Brady played a lot longer than all the others.
Are you arguing against him now?
No, just trying to recognize that I'm biased!
That's fair. I really do think he's cemented himself as the best quarterback.
Counterarguments and all, I do agree. I think he could be in conversation for the best ever player, but I don't know that he's got that.
That is so difficult. It is like comparing apples to oranges.
I know. How do you compare a quarterback with a receiver or back? I just don't think you can do it.
If you look at stats alone, Jerry Rice may be the best of all time.
For sure. His records are mind blowing. Although some say Jim Brown deserves the title of best ever.
Okay help me out here. Who is he?
Way before our time. He played for the Browns from '57-'65,
I guess I need to look into him.
You should. He's in the conversation, but like with Brady now, it was just a totally different time and game then.
