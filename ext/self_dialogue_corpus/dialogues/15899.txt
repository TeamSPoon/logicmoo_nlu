Hey what have you been doing?
Not much, just totally bored!
Yeah me to. I think I am going to go to the store and buy a CD.
Oh that sounds like fun. What CD are you going to get?
I'm not sure. What kind of music do you like?
I'm a huge country fan.
I love country music to. What artists do you like?
My all time favorite is Reba McEntire.
I love her. My favorite songs of hers are Fancy, And Still, and Why Haven't I Heard from You.
Yeah I am definitely a fan of her older stuff.
Yeah me to. What other country singers do you like?
I like Martina McBride, Trisha Yearwood, Carrie Underwood, and Kelly Pickler.
Carrie Underwood is probably my favorite.
Yeah her song Jesus Take the Wheel is one of the best.
Have you ever heard her song Temporary Home?
Yes, it is so sad. I cried when I watched the video.
Yeah it was sad. Most country songs are sad.
I think Carrie Underwood just came out with a new CD.
Cool! I will definitely have to buy that one.
Awesome! When you do I want to borrow it.
