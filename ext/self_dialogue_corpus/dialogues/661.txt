This year for sure I'm going to get to a home game for the NFL.
That really seems to be your dream since you mention it every year.
It is a goal of mine. I can't believe you hate sports so much.
Yep. not a fan at all.
But you know a lot of players.
Don't let that fool you.
Why?
Because is I know a player's name it's a 95% sure thing that they were once on Dancing with the Stars.
Dancing with the Stars? You watch that?
Yes, and before you mock let me remind you that a lot of the football players you idolize COMPETE on the show, so if you mock me you doubly mock them.
Never thought of that. OK, no mocking.
You know Donald Driver from football, I know him from his killer Pasa Doble.
You do seems to know a lot of plays.
Oh yes, they have the best work ethic so it's fun to watch them compete in a ballroom setting.
Don't you know anything else about the NFL?
I know when a player is dating or married to a celebrity.
Seriously? This is the sum total of your knowledge?
Yes, like Wendy Williams says, the only way I care about sports is if it collides with celebrity.
Well, it's better than nothing.
True. If not for tabloids and dance shows I wouldn't know anyone.
