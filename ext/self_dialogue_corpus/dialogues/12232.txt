Do you know who Irvin Kershner is?
I havent heard of him
He directed the Empire Strikes Back.
Oh ok thats cool
Yeah he was probably the best director  they had
Thats pretty cool.
He also directed other movies.
I wish he would have done Return of the Jedi.
You dont like the way that movie was directed?
I think it could have had improvements
