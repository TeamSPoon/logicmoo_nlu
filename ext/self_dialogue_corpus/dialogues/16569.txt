How's it going CJ?
Really good man just listening to some music.
That reminds me that I need a new iPod, what you listening to?
I'm a big fan of trance actually, I'm listening to some Robert Miles.
Is that a DJ?
Yeah Miles is a DJ, he recently passed away and it's still upsetting.
That sucks man, I will check out some of his works.
You should! He is a master at trance music.
And trance is what exactly?
Trance is more a dance genre that evolved from disco and techno.
Are there vocals in trance?
Sometimes there are, but trance is mostly ambient noise and sound that provides an escape for the mind.
That sounds immense!
It truly is! Check out 'Children' by Robert Miles!
I definitely will, I need an escape.
Believe me, I get that. Ask me for any other recommendations if you end up liking trance.
Will do! Any artists to recommend now so I can search later?
Try Armin Van Buuren and DJ Tiesto!
I have heard of Tiesto actually!
He is famous, but make sure to check out the earlier stuff. It's where all the real emotion lies in their works.
