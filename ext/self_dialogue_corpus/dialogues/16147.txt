Do you like Pink Floyd?
I haven't heard much, but I like what I've heard.
What Pink Floyd stuff have you listened to?
'Dark Side of the Moon', of course, and 'The Wall'.
Ah, the two most famous albums and so different!
They really are different aren't they? Why is that?
Both the bassist and guitarist wrote for Pink Floyd, and 'The Wall' is primarily the bassist's writing.
And 'Dark Side of the Moon'?
That was more written by the whole band, if I recall correctly.
That's my favorite of the two, if I had to pick.
I think it's everyone's favorite. It's just an incredible album.
Have you ever done the Wizard of Oz thing?
Where you sync the album up to the movie? I have, actually!
Oh! What happened?
There are definitely some weird coincidences.
Like what?
There are times when the lyrics perfectly describe what's happening on scene, or the 'feel' of the music matches.
Oh, that's creepy. Do you think it's intentional?
No way, not at all. That seems like a lot of work for what ends up as minor coincidences.
Agreed. I always thought people who think they wrote the album to match the film are a bit crazy.
