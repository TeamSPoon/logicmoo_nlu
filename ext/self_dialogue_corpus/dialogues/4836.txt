I don't like it when you go to a game and there is missive playing as that batters walk up.
You don't like it?
No.
I do. I think it pumps then up.
Maybe, but the music is bad.
I agree with that.
They should have no music.
I guess it would take it back to the old days.
I wonder if the players like it.
I don't think they have a say.
Did you notice on last night's game how all the fans cheered for smiths as he came to the plate.
Yes.
That's because they had no music playing as he came up.
I did notice that the opposing team would come up to bat.
It sounds nice.
Yup, kissy good old baseball.
You going tonight.
No I have tickets for next home stand
Same here
Let's carpool
