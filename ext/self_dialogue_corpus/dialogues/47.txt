Which version of Spiderman do you prefer?
The one with Toby Maguire definitely!
Me too! I think Kirsten Dunst and Toby did a really good job.
Not to mention it was so cool how they managed to make a film about spiders not freak anybody out.
Same. I have a total fear of spiders.
It was awesome how they showed Peter's backstory.
You mean how he became spider man?
Exactly! Showing how the web slings out from his wrists and everything.
I love that scene where it shows him designing his costume.
It's like he was totally aware of what he was doing.
