Are you interested in going to the movies this weekend?
Yeah! I heard there's a good one called Annabelle.
What's that about?
I think it's about a doll that comes to life and haunts some people.
I'm not really interested in movies about dolls.
Okay. Would you prefer to see Hostel?
Yeah, I would go watch that one. Which one?
I didn't know there was more than one.
Unfortunately. They should have stopped at the first movie.
Some horror movies just keep making them, even when they shouldn't. Just like Final Destination.
