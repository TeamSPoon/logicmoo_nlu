What do you think of Pride and Prejudice, and Zombies.
I mean, they sort of slam the classics.
I think they make them very funny though.
That one did have very good graphics.
Did you see the one about Lincoln?
Abraham Lincolc: Vampire Hunter.

I am a fan of Van Helsing.
That one had Kate Beckinsile in it right?
Yes, and Hugh Jackman.
I thought it was a really cool movies.
Did you see her in the other vampire movies she did?
