Have you seen any of The Beatles movies?
I saw 'A Hard Day's Night' years ago and enjoyed it.
That's a great movie, they look so young!
I love their sense of humor in it. The script is great.
Is that the only one you've seen?
Yes, what others are there?
There's 'Help!' and 'Magical Mystery Tour'.
Oh 'Help!', of course. I've seen clips of it.
And 'Magical Mystery Tour'?
I haven't seen it but I've heard it's really weird, just like the album of the same name.
