Hey just so you know, I'm not coming to the Jets Giants preseason game this year.
What, why not?
The Jets have no quaterback this year.
So, the Giants have no O line again.
Yeah, I guess thats true, but still I don't think Petty is gonna get us any wins.
Don't let that keep you from a day of tailgaiting.
But I hate to watch my boys loose another season.
We go despite knowing our teams wont do well.
At least you guys had 11 wins and got to the wild card game.
Yeah and we lost that to Green Bay, getting to the wild card game was a gift.
We had 5 wins last season.
I know, not the best record. Still, you gonna miss a day of tailgating.
I just can't cheer a loosing team.
Think of the burgers and cold beer.
They were really tasty.
And we had amazing seats, right over the tunnel.
I know, I still have the pictures from last year.
The one you got of Eli was great.
Alright, I'll come this year, at least they might win one preseason game.
Maybe they'll have a quaterback by then.
