You know what movie I haven't seen in ages.
What?
Pocahontas.
I don't think I've ever seen Pocahontas. What's it about?
It's about this British soldier who comes to America in the 1800s and meets a tribe of Native Americans.
Cool.
He then falls in love with a local girl named Pocahontas.
As you do.
Then they dance around a giant tree whilst the tribe sings songs.
So basically it's Avatar.
