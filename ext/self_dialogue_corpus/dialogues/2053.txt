What did you think about the recent draft?
I don't think there were many stars this year
Yeah I think this draft class is not gonna do well
I'd say thats the most likely outcome
Yeah, I think the college selection was poor this year
I wonder if it will be better next year
It depends on the incoming class of high schoolers
Yeah I suppose
Teams can't be good without a steady influx of new talent
I think that's why the same teams have been winning a lot
Yeah the veterans overpower the teams with younger players
It's kind of sad to be honest
They just need coaches with more vision
I'm sure that someone will come along that knows what they're doing
I'd have to say so
They basically have no other option lest they keep losing
The best teams will know how to adapt
It's gonna be interesting to see how the scouts delevop
I love it when young players turn out to be extremely good
I love seeing new players in the league often
