How great was Robin Williams in Alladin?
It was the best performance of any character in the Disney universe.
His singing was great and the lyrics he had.
I think he made up some of the words as he went along.
I think he played the role great and was able to go on both ends of the spectrum.
Yeah he would offer Alladin advice and then at the same time tell him why hes wrong.
Yeah and this is what made the movie so great.
Its a shame hes not here to do a 2nd one.
I think they would have done it by now.
You never know with disney sometimes it takes time.
