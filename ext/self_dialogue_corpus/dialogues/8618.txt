Do you like Metallica?
You know, I'm not a huge fan, but we say our son's "song" is one of theirs.
In what way?
Well, when my son was born, their song "The Unforgiven" was playing on the radio.
Oh wow that's awesome. That's a good song.
Yeah it's probably my favorite Metallica song. It's very cool.
Definitely. Do you like any other Metallica songs?
Sure, I mean I like their hits OK. I like "Enter Sandman."
I think everyone likes that song!
Yeah really. It's a rocking song.
