Are you a big fan of the NFL?
Yes, I watch a lot of games during the season.
Good. Who is your favorite team?
I am a big fan of the packers.
Oh, okay. I am a steelers fan.
Okay. They're pretty good too.
So how do you think your team will do this season?
I think we will be pretty good. Our division isn;t very strong.
Yeah, The bears, lions, and vikings all are okay, but not really top grade.
Yeah. What about you guys?
I think we will be okay. We are pretty solid at all positions.
Yeah, you guys are really deep at receiver.
Yeah we are. IT's going to be interesting to see what happens with bryant after his suspension.
Yeah, he looked like he worked hard with his time off though.
Very true, he looked like he was in really good shape. He also put on about ten pounds of muscle.
Yeah, but that high pick on a receiver put some pressure on.
Yeah, he will definitely be a starter i think. If he's decent him and bryant may fight for the two spot eventually.
Yeah. What about bell?
I heard they're still negotiating.
Thats interesting.
