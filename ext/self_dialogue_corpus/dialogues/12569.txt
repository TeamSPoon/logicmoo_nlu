Why are so many people into Star Wars?
I have no idea. But I really like the special effects.
I sold some vintage space craft on eBay. I think it was called the Millenium Falcon.
Really how much did you get?
I don't remember but it wasn't in pristine condition.
I think it's a shame about Princess Lea.
Oh my gosh, I heard she was on several really strong drugs.
When is the new episode due out?
I'm not quite sure, but I definately want to see it.
Me, too! I can't wait.
