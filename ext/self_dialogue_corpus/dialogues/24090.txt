Do you have any special Christmas movies you watch every year?
Well, maybe not every year...
What one?
Gremlins.
Gremlins?
Yeah, it's hard to explain...
What are gremlins?
They start off as these cute soft creatures, but if you break one of the rules, they turn into little monsters.
There are rules?
Yeah, you're supposed to never get them wet, never expose them to direct sunlight and never feed them after midnight.
But every time is after midnight from the last midnight!
See I told you it's hard to explain.
But okay, I'm intrigued.
It's actually a really sweet movie for being about little monsters. There's a character in it that makes my blood boil though.
Not one of the monsters?
No, this pesky lady who tries to make trouble for everybody.
Sounds like she doesn't have the Christmas spirit.
She really doesn't. You gotta watch it though.
I will.
Then you'll get the reference when I say "bye bye woof woof!"
