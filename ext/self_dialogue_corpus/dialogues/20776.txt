Have you seen the new, live-action Beauty and the Beast yet?
Yes,  I really enjoyed it.
Me too,  I thought Emma Watson did a great job.
You're right she was perfect as Belle.
What was your favorite part of the movie?
The scene where they sang Gaston was hilarious.  I think that was the best part.
I was impressed that they were able to make some changes to that song while keeping it recognizable.
Was there anything that you didn't like about the movie?
I thought Gaston's character was a lot darker than the original.
Totally,  the part where he left Maurice to die in the woods was disturbing.
I think it made the movie a little too scary for young kids.
Definitely,  the original had a few scary scenes, but this was much more intense.
One thing I did like with the darker Gaston character, they were able to give LeFou a chance to change sides.
Yes I like how LeFou's character started to recognize Gaston as the real beast.
Did you like how they handled the enchanted objects?
Surprisingly yes!  I thought the Wardrobe was especially well designed.
Good one,  I thought it was hilarious when she dressed those guys up during the fight scene.
I was laughing out loud at that one.
I even cried when  the objects lost the humanity they had left.
Me too,  even though I knew they would turn back the way it was filmed was moving.
