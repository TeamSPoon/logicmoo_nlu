I'm so excited to go see Pirates of the Caribean 5
me too I love Johnny Depp!
and Orlando Bloom
and anything to do with Pirates!
Do you think Kiera Knightly will be in it?
I hope so - she's gorgeous
Won't be the same if she doesn't drink Jack's rum
The ghost makeup kinda freaks me out
but they do it so well - the drippy oozy underwater stuff is so cool
I'm going to wait a couple days to go see it
I know i hate a crowded theater
you have to watch it on a big screen to get the full effect
i know - the ocean scenes are spectacular
and the fight scenes
and Johnny's face!
Jack Sparrow is such a great character
I heard Paul Mcartney is in it
what1?
yeah he's Jack's uncle or somthing
OMG - can't wait to see this!
