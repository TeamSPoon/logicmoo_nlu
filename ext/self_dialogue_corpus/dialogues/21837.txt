Have you seen any new movies you would recommend?
I just watched a good comedy.
What was it called?
Rough Night.
Never heard of it, what is it about.
I will not spoil it for you, but it has to do with a guy dying during a girls night out.
Any other new movies I should check out.
The Pirates of The Caribean was really good.
They made a new one again?
Yes, it has lots of action.
Does it have Will Turner?
Again, will not spoil it, but it does have his son.
And Johnny Depp too?
Yes. I think this is the last one he will do.
I hope so. There are so many.
Almost as many as Fast and the Furious.
That franchise has so many, too many.
I think Star Wars will be the same, just keep making them.
I think there are two set to be out this year alone.
I hate when they keep making the same movie over and over again.
