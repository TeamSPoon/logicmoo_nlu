Hi, Geoff, what are you watching?
Hey, Zebadiah, I'm watching The Lord of the Rings
Nice, which of the three are you watching?
I'm watching the Fellowship of the Ring, extended version?
Extended version, what's that?
It's a longer version of the movie, it has like 30 more minutes of movie.
Oh wow, I didn't know that there was an extended version.
Yeah, it adds some background information and other things to the movie.
Do the other two movies also have extended versions?
They sure do!
Thats cool, so do the extended versions match up to the books better?
Yeah, kind of.
Kind of?
Well, they provide some more details that were given in the books, but weren't really necessary to the movies.
Oh ok, so basically this is just the stuff that the director wanted to add back to it.
Yeah, I guess he figured that some people might want to see more.
That's a good idea.  I wonder if they release two versions to a lot of movies.
I've heard of a few, but not too many.
It would be awesome if they did that with the original Star Wars movies.
That would be cool,but I doubt they filmed stuff they didn't use.
