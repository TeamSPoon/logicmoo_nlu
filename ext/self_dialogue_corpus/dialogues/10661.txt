Did you see the new Fast & the Furious?
Yes I did but it's not the same without Mia and Brian.
I know Paul Walker wasn't in this one because he passed, but why wasn't Mia?
I don't know. I think each movie gets more unrealstic.
You're totally right the action scenes Dom and his team do aren't believable.
Is that the last Fast & Furious movie to come out?
I am pretty sure it is. I have seen them all except for Too Fast & Furious.
I have seen them all. My favorite is Tokyo Drift.
Yeah I like that one because Bow Wow is in it.
I just like those cars the best.
