Who is your favorite band?
I really don't have a favorite, do you?
I love the Beatles! They are my all time favorite.
Oh, nice! I love them too, actually!
Do you have a singer or just a favorite song?
Well, I guess if I had to pick somebody it would be Johnny Cash!
Ring of Fire! Yeah, he was a great icon for country and rockabilly sound.
Agreed! The rockabilly sound is the genre that I am drawn to the most.
Okay, Right on! That makes me think of bands like Social Distortion.
Yeah, that would be on my top 10 favorite list for sure!
Have you ever gotten to see them in concert?
Nope, I did get to see Johnny Cash when I was a kid though.
NOWAY MAN! I am so jealous!
I was a lucky kid! My dad took me to see a lot of different bands growing up but I never had a favorite.
You must have had a really great dad to expose you to lots of different sounds!!
I was pretty lucky because we lived in a big city and had a venue that played famous musicians all the time.
Wow! That is so cool, any one concert stand out in your mind?
I would say that seeing Queen was an ultimate show!
Dang, Freddie Mercury of Queen was and still is an iconic master musicain!
Yeah, I am gonna go listen to Bohemian Rhapsody now!
