Favorite Disney princess. Go.
Oh, Moana, easily.
Really? I thought we agreed Belle was the best.
You said favorite. Moana is my new favorite.
Okay, why?
Because she gets things done, because the ocean chose her, and because she didn't need a romantic interest.
Oh yeah, forgot you were aromantic.
Yep, instant identification. Plus her singing voice.
Oh absolutely, How Far I'll Go is STILL stuck in my head.
Can you believe they just FOUND that girl?!
