Who is your favorite band?
The rolling stones.
Oh ya, I have seen them live.
That's cool, me too 4 times.
I saw then 2002 ish or so. no doubt was the opening act.
That seems like a great concert.
I enjoyed it. I felt badly for No doubt though.
Why?
Well most people were there for the stones. they did not seems to pay much attention to the set.
Crazy,No doubt is so good too.
Well I agree, but sometimes fans are not crossover fans, ya know?
Totally. I feel musicians may want to consider their fans when they pick an opener.
Exactly. You want to have them appeal to the taste of your fans.
I think some people only care about the headliner. SO many arrive so late.
That's true. The worst is when at a concert and the band is so late.
Oh that absolute worst. One time I think I waited like a full hour for the headliner to come on stage.
Like are they just choosing to be jerks or are they really late from a flight or something?
You would think they would send the opening act back on to fill the time.
I think that is hard because they need to change out the equipment for each band.
Good point did not take that in consideration.
