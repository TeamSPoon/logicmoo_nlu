Isn't their supposed to be an Incredibles sequel?
I've heard that for years and years and nothing.
It came out a while ago, I think.
2004 to be exact.  I was still in college when it was released.
I wish the dad were my insurance agent.
If it meant I could get what I wanted from the company, sure.
I still don't really understand how the kid got rich.
And bought his own island?  Yeah, a bit farfetched.
I would never wear tight clothes like that.
I'm glad you don't!
