Do you think Russell Wilson has recovered from those nagging injuries he had last season?
I hope so and so do the Seattle Seahawks. They'll need him to be 100% again this season if they hope to compete.
They made it through the regular season last year and just got destroyed by Atlanta in the playoffs.
I wouldn't say they got destroyed but they definitely looked a lot inferior.
That's true Atlanta was on fire to end the season and that offense was nearly unstoppable.
Not to mention it but Atlanta's defense stepped up in the playoffs, so you couple that up with their offense and Seattle had no chance.
I think a healthy Russell Wilson would have made a difference.
I don't think it would've mattered. The Seahawks last season had so many holes to fill on their team.
Does it seem weird to you that Marshawn Lynch is going to be in another NFL Jersey playing for another team next year?
It doesn't really surprise me that much, people forget that Marshawn was on the Buffalo Bills before coming to the Seahawks.
Right, but with the Seahawks, that's when Marshawn became the BEAST and was really a public face people recognized.
I think winning a Superbowl does that. It puts you into the spotlight.
Oh no doubt about that. I think it'll be strange seeing him in a Raiders jersey next year.
I'm excited about that! The Raiders are on a climb and I think they'll really challenge the Patriots this year and might even make it to the Superbowl.
That could happen if Derek Carr is back and fully healthy. If not I don't like their chances.
They're one of the favorites this off season and Carr is young, he's going to recover.
I hope he does, they looked great last year with him!
I think it'll be even better this year with Marshawn to take pressure off of him.
The Seahawks should be able to take the NFC West this year I think. Arizona looks weaker.
We'll have to see. Things change so much each year in the NFL.
