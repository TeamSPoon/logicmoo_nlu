I really can't wait for the new Star Wars movie, coming out soon.
How soon is soon, though?
It should be coming around December of 2017.
Wow, this year, huh? That's pretty exciting.
Yeah, for sure. I really did like the last one.
You mean, The Force Awakens?
Actually, the last Star Wars movie was Rogue One. It wasn't part of the main series but it was great.
I must have missed that one. It was really that good?
I thought so. It had a great plot and cast.
Who was in it? Anyone I know?
Felicity Jones? Diego Luna?
Hm, that doesn't really ring any bells to me.
How about Ben Mendelsohn?
Yeah, I know him actually. He's pretty good, usually.
Yeah, it's definately worth a watch.
I better watch it then, before that new one comes out.
That's right. You wanna be all caught up for December.
I take it you're going opening day, are you?
Bingo. We better get ready to camp out for tickets on opening day.
Ha, you better be kidding about that.
