Have you seen all Harry Potter movies?
Yes I have
And what did you think of them?
In what aspect?
In terms of overall quality?
I thought the quality was good.
But?
But it didnt follow the books as much as I had hoped.
What do you mean?
Well the books were interesting, the movies were not.
What was different?
The movies lacked the power the books had.
Example?
I don't really have one other than it felt like a disney production more than a magical movie.
How so?
The acting was sub-par and it all had a happy ending.
So what was it missing?
Suspense, reality.
What do you mean?
I never felt like the movies grabbed me, they just kind of played.
