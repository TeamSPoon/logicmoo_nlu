Did you ever hear Telephone by Lady Gaga?
I have! Didn't she make that song with Beyonce?
I believe she did. They also made another track together too.
What was it called? It was called Video Phone.
Awesome! I love it when artists collaborate.
Didn't she also collaborate with someone for the track Just Dance?
She did! It was a singer named Colby O'Donnis.
I've never heard of him before.
I don't think he had a lot of success after the song.
But I'm sure glad he was on that song! I love everything about it!
