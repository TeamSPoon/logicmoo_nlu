What is your favorite Movie?
That's a hard decision. Probably, Ghostbusters.
The new Ghostbusters from a few months ago?
No, the original one form the 1980s with Bill Murray. It is a classic.
I haven't seen it. Who else is in it?
It has lots of people. Annie Potts, Sigourney Weaver, Dan Akroyd, and Ernie Hudson to name a few.
Wow, that sounds like a who's who of 80's stars. Is it all comedy or is it scary, too?
It's pretty much a farce, but it's amazing. I have seen it over 20 times. I can quote most of it.
Wow, I don't think I have seen any movie 20 times. I saw the latest Star Wars 5 times, though.
You mean Rouge One?
No, the last one with a new trilogy. The Force Awakens.
I saw that one twice. It made me feel like a child again. It was like watching the first trilogy.
Maybe that's why you like Ghostbuster's so much.
What do you mean?
I mean like nostalgia from your childhood.
Maybe, but I don't think so. Ghostbuster's just makes me laugh.
Even after seeing it 20 times.
Yes. The delivery is so perfect it still sounds like the jokes are made up on the spot. I am telling you it is a classic.
Maybe I will stream it this weekend.
You should, I think you would really enjoy it.
