Yeah, those are classics.
What's your favorite Bond film?
I liked Goldeneye alot.
Who played that Bond again?
Pierce Brosnan played Bond in that one.
Oh, it's hard to keep track of all the Bonds.
I know they always seem to be changing.
I think Daniel Craig is the most recent Bond.
Casino Royale was a great movie.
