Oh my goodness!
What? What is it?
Beauty and the Beast is officially tied with Maleficent for my favorite live action Disney movie. Actually Maleficent still wins because Angelina Jolie was AMAZING in that role.
You're telling me. It's one of her best roles in my opinion.
Do you have a favorite live action Disney movie?
As far as remakes go also Maleficent, but in general? Either Honey, I Shrunk the Kids or The Mighty Ducks with Emilio Estevez.
The Mighty Ducks is probably the only sports movie I'll ever watch, and can watch it repeatedly at that. Funnier still is I normally could care less about hockey, but that was a great movie from start to finish.
I don't know man, Air Bud was a pretty good Disney sports movie.
Saw it in theaters and the original was perfect but not quite enough to be in my faves. Plus they made way too many sequels and spin-offs.
That's an understatement! 14 movies is absolutely ridiculous though I really can't fault Disney for wanting to fully take advantage of this cash cow.
