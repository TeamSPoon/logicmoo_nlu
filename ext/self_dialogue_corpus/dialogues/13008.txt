What do you think about the new fan theories about Rey from Force Awakens.
I've seen some really good ones.
So who do you think her father is?
Personally, I'm betting it's Han Solo.
Oh, and Kylo Ren is her brother?
Yeah. Who do you think her father is?
I'm thinking it's Obi-Wan Kenobi.
Oh really? Why him?
I think the ages could work and they both have that accent...
That makes sense if the accents are purposefully kept to show familial relations. We'll have to wait to find out though.
