I have another Joan Crawford,Bette Davis thriller for you. How about Hush Hush,Sweet Charlotte.
Another great thriller.
Great cast in that movie.
All star cast. Joseph Cotton,Victor Buono and Olivia de Haviland.
How about Agnes Moorehead.
Right,Bewitched mother on tv.
Yes,and she won the academy award for best supporting actress.

That was out in 1964 I think.
Yes,you're right
