So do you think that Luke Skywalker is going to be killed off in the new movie coming later this year?
It kind of seems like that due to the movies title.
Yeah the Last Jedi. Seems like it is possible.
I really like Luke and since we lost Han it may make me cry.
Yeah me too. But at least we get to see him more in this movie.
True. And I'm excited about Rey's Jedi training.
Yes! I can't wait to see how strong Rey is in the force.
Seeing that she was stronger the Kylo Ren then she should be interesting to watch.
This movie can't come to quickly for me.
I feel the same way, we should go see it together!
