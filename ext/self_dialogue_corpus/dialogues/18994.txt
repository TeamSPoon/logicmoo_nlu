Do you consider yourself part of the Twenty One Pilots fanbase?
Definitely! I love their emo rap poetry music. My favorite is "Glowing Eyes".
Me too! What's your favorite Tyler Joseph song?
Definitely "Blasphemy", what about you?
I really like "Drown".
Have you heard of Panic! at the Disco?
No, who are they?
They used to be a band, but it's been reduced to just Brendon Urie.
Oh, what genre is he?
It's mostly rock.
Hmm, maybe I'll check him out sometime. Meanwhile, have you heard of Melanie Martinez?
Yeah, her music is OK. I like Mariah Carey.
Personally, I think she's a one-hit wonder.
Yeah, I guess so.
Have you heard of Crush 40?
No, who is that?
They produce most of Sonic the Hedgehog's main theme titles for his games.
Oh, yeah! Eh, their music is terrible.
Well, we all have our opinions.
Yep.
