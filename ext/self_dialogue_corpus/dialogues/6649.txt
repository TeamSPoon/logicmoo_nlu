Did you know about the national treasure movie series?
Yes i watch the 2004 movie but later part I didn't remember
Seriously you should watch the movie it is full of thriller and adventorous
Yes I love the first part I will watch the other parts also
Nicholas Cage acting is mind blowing, did you remember his stunt in the movie
Yes that was so awesome I love that scene when he dive theu the building, he is a hero
And also a cryptologist is such a genius he can crack any code
The last code seems quite difficult but the logic is sees correct in the movie
It is most adventurous movie I love this
Yes the movie is fully adventurous not a single minute I feel bore when watching this movie
