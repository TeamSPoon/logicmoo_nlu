Can you imagine star wars without darth vader
That would be a horribly boring movie
I know he is the central part to the movie
Without him the movie is nothing
Pretty much it is the center piece of the whole film
yeah he is also the most famous
Sure almost everyone knows who he is
Yeah not one person does not know
He is world famous
Pretty much
