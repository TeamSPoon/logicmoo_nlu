Did you see the Second Alice and Wonderland movie?
No, was it any good?
The imagery was stunning, the plot not so much.
Why was it not good Johnny Depp was in it?
He did awful, nothing like his Pirates of the Caribean movies.
I loved all of those.Have you looked into the new one?
Yes, I heard it is gonna be amazing. Did you ever see some of his older movies?
Of course, Edward Scissor hands is my favorite, how about you?
I lived that one. My favorite is Cry Baby, ever seen it?
No, I have heard of it, I like Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas too.
That one was a masterpiece. Did you like his part in the Willy Wonka movie?
No, I thought he bombed it. Did you like the old Willy Wonka movie with Gene Wilder?
Yes! Amazing, not as good as Blazing Saddles.
Blazing Saddles in the all time best comedy, second to it would be Young Frenkenstein.
That was an amazing movie too, did you ever see the I, Frankenstein movie?
No, it looked silly. Reminded me of the Underworld Franshise.
Did you see the new Underworld it was good.
Yeah, it was ok. For that genre I prefer Resident Evil movies.
Those are always good, did you like Ultra Violet?
No, it looked to campy for me.
