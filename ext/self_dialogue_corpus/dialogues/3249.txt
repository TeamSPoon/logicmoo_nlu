I saw a good horror movie last week.  It was about a guy who wanted to know if there is an afterlife.
What was it called
We Go On
What happens in it
The guy has nighmares about death and dying and he is afraid of everything
Sounds bad, so what does he do
He inherits money and he puts out an ad saying he will pay 30,000 dollars to someone who can prove there is an aftelife
Sounds really interesting
Well, lets just say it turns out sort of badly for him
Don't mess with the Occult heh?
