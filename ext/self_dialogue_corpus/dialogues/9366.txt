What was the name of Eminem's first song?
It was My Name Is.
Oh, now I remember.
Yeah, I remember the first time I heard that song.  They were playing it on the alternative station!
Really?  They probably didn't know what kind of music this was.
I sure didn't.  I thought it was a novelty or parody act.
Yeah, most people probably did.  Did you have the CD?
I bought that one and his second one.
Did you like it?
It was more serious than I expected, but I loved it.
