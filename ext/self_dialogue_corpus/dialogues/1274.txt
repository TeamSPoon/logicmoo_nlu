Who is the best team in the Midwest.
Wow! there are some awful teams but I'll go with the Colts I guess.
Yeah, Bengals and Browns are awful.
How about the Bears?
I don't see the Bears doing better this year.
Sad to see how much they've struggled.
How about the best team out West?
Seattle or maybe the Raiders.
Don't forget Arizona, they've improved.
Have they?
Best team in Texas?
Easy, the Cowboys and maybe the best team overall.
How about the South?
Probably still the Falcons.
I would love to see the Titans pull it all together.
Isn't that where Mariota is at?
Northeast?
Still has to be New England.
Yeah, sad to see how bad the Jets are.
They're awful.
