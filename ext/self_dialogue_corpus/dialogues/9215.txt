It's amazing how much the rock genre has grown over the years.
It really is. Hard to believe it went from Elvis Presley to spawning so many sub-genres.
Some of those sub-genres even ended up becoming big too!
I'm guessing you mean heavy metal?
That'd definitely be the best example. There's a lot of other ones, though.
Punk rock comes to mind.
Yes! That sub-genre has developed its own culture by this point.
Punk rock is actually my favorite rock sub-genre.
Nice. Who's your favorite band?
I'd definitely have to go with Black Flag on that one.
