Rogue One: A Star Wars Story just came out on Blu-Ray and streaming.  Did you see it?
I saw it at the movie theater, and will definitely see it again online.
It's amazing how Tarkin and Leah were completely generated by CG.
I didn't realize it until I read about it online.  It's sad that Carrie Fisher passed away right after the movie was released.
I'm sure it was devastating news for a generation of Star Wars fans.
It's a good thing that she had already finished filming her parts for the upcoming Episode 8 movie.
Oh, the "Last Jedi"!  It's coming out in December, right?  Did you see the teaser trailer?
I saw it a few weeks ago. It was just a teaser but I am already excited nonetheless!!
Disney announced that they will be making Star Wars films at least through 2030!
What! You mean the story is going to continue past this current trilogy?
Yeah, it opens up the possibility for a whole new trilogy after Episode 9.
Wow, that totally lessens the importance of these next two movies....like there is no finality.  I wish they didn't announce that.
It should keep this current generation of new Star Wars fans in the loop and maybe a whole new generation in 10 years.
So by the time the final movie comes out in 2030 or so, it would be more than 50 years since the first movie!
That's so crazy! But I guess it goes to show how the first Star Wars movie completely revolutionized film making at the time.
Yeah. Even though it's somewhat dated now, there are parts of it that are still fresh and relevant today.
I sometimes watch parts of it whenever it's re-run on TV, and often find myself noticing new things about it, every time.
It's amazing how most of the first three films are not CG!  They are almost all live action, with miniatures and clever effects.
Yeah, it should teach filmmakers today a lot of lessons about not becoming so reliant on CG.
So, the next movie comes out by the end of the year....I can't wait!!
