Hey, Melanie and I are starting the Harry Potter series of movies. Care to join us?
Do you mean all of them?
Yes, we were going to watch the first one The Sorcerers Stone tonight?
There are a lot of movies but I could for sure be there to watch one at a time. That's a great idea!
Yes, and we are both going to dress as our idea of Hermoine.
That sounds fun, I can do that. Maybe we could switch characters for every movie.
That's a great idea. And make snacks to go along with the movie.
I can do that. What should I bring?
Well how about some kind of Halloween snack since it has that feast in the movie?
Great idea! I will make pumpkin cookies!
