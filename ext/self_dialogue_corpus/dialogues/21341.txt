Definitely better that Pulp Fiction. For one, it was much more innovative.
How can you say that? Hateful Eight was so imaginative.
Well, if you consider the time period in which Pulp Fiction was shot and released, the 1990s, it was definitely ahead of it's time.
I guess I can't disagree with that. But Hateful Eight is by far his best film.
What about Reservoir Dogs?
Wow, now that you mention it, that was his best film. I completely forgot about that.
I don't blame you. Tarantino has so many awesome films that it's hard to keep them straight.
Did you know the local theater is screening some of his films this weekend? Planet Terror, Grindhouse, Kill Bill --
Which Kill Bill?
Both of them.
Awesome! I've never seen Kill Bill Volume Two.
You're missing out! For me, it's definitely better than Volume One. The story is much more easy to follow.
What about the fight scenes?
Epic, man. So epic. By far, the best fight scenes in any movie produced after 1990. Except maybe Inglorious Basterds.
Yes! I loved that movie. So dark, but definitely relevant to the times today.
For sure. Brad Pitt was great in it. The whole ensemble was great, too.
I wonder what Tarantino is going to do next.
Me too. But I'm sure whatever he does, I'll like it.
Me too.
See you at the theater!
