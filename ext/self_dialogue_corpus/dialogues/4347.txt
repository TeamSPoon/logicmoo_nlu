what is your favorite Denis Villeneuve movie?
I would pick prisoners or arrival.
Good choices. I think prisoners was very dark.
It is a dark movie. It had me biting my nails almost the whole time.
Hugh Jackman had so much intensity in his performance. It was crazy!
Jackman was good, but I  actually found Jake Gyllenhaal's performance even better.
Jake Gyllenhaal was more out of his typical role or rather look in this film.
Really ever since donnie darko I think of him in a kind of darker movie world.
I guess I see jake as more of a young boy or had until this film.
Here he is  in a role as an adult profession.. police officer/detective. Change from teenage roles like donnie darko.
