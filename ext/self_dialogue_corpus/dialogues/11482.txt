the beatles wrote some of the most iconic love songs of all time
even more than bruno mars?
yes, don't be stupid
give me an example, then!
you shouldn't even need an example. i have one word for you: something

yeah, the best love song of all time!
can't be that good if he ended up breaking up with the girl
wow!
just saying. i guess it's a good song though, whatever
