So what's the deal with K-pop?
Why are you asking me? Why would I know?
Oh shut up. I know you like K-pop.
Okay you got me. K-pop is good music.
Why K-pop in general?
Well do you know about modern Korean culture?
No, I don't really know much.
Korean media and Korean music is pretty ahead of all the other countries, so they produce music of the same quality as America.
Oh really? Is the only genre pop?
I think K-pop covers a pretty large genre. There's a diverse amount of music.
What's your favorite
I like the old stuff, SNSD and Red Velvet.
You think I should give it a try.
If you don't care about lyrics, K-pop can be quite catchy.
Is there rap in K-pop.
Totally. Anything you can find in America, you can find in K-pop.
I didn't know K-pop was that big.
Just google any popular K-pop song. The number of views will shock you.
Alright, I'll have to check it out sometime.
Yep.
