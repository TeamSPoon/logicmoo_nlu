I think music is heading in the right direction
What measurement are you using?
The way people get content.
What streaming service do you use?
I think Spotify is the best
Better than Pandora?
Yeah I think its a sleeker design and what you pay for is the best.
I think its cheap.
Plus you can get it for a discount if you try hard enough.
How about YouTube?
No there are too many ads in the app.
You can pay to eliminate those.
Yeah but its not enough for what i Use it for.
Plus the data streaming is alot more.
And it kills the battery on the phone.
What about Apple Music?
I think its too pricey.
Some people love to use Apple products.
YEah I am not one of them
Its important to be financially sound when making that decision as well.
