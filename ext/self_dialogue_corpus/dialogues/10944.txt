Did you see the 2017 IIHF Ice Hockey World Championship?
Yes I did! It was hosted in Germany and France.
What about the game between France and Canada?
That game was awesome! The French took a 2-1 lead early in the second and managed to keep the Canadians at bay until the last minute of the period.
It was so good!
How about the match between Germany and Slovakia?
That was pretty exciting! I can't believe Germany won.
It was pretty close, within less than 30 seconds, Yasin Ehliz beat the Slovakian goalie through the five hole to tie it for Germany, who went on to win it in a shootout.
What about Cristobal Huet? It's unbelievable how he's still playing.
I know! How old is he?
He's 41 I believe!
Age is just a number, he made a save on Switzerland's Vincent Praplan in the penalty shootout that decided their Group B match.
What about that save by Florian Hardy??
Let's talk about him!
When I saw how he reached out with the paddle of his stick, I was amazed that he got just enough of the puck to prevent a goal on the rebound.
You should've seen Finnish forward Oskar Osala, who had taken the shot on an (almost) open net!
I definitely did, he could only stare in disbelief.
It was such a shock, I still can't get it off my head.
That game in Cologne though, France made a big upset on Finland!
I know, they beat them and they were last year's finalists with a score of 5-1. Great game!
