How do you like the Detroit Red Wings?
I love them!  They have done better, but they're still a favorite of mine!
Remember how awesome they were in the late 90s?  Man they were on fire!
Yeah they were!  I can't believe how many times they went to play offs and how many cups they won.
I think Steve Yzerman had a lot to do with it.
He was a pretty amazing captain. The Red Wings have had some really good players over the years.
There have been a lot of guys who made the Hall of Fame.
Yeah, like Chelios, Hull, Robitaille, Larionov, Hasek and Shanahan.
All excellent players!
Did you catch the game against the Devils?  They really got them good!
Yeah I did!  Can't believe how bad the Devils lots.
Do you know where they're sitting in the Eastern Conference?
Unfortunately they aren't doing so hot.  They're second to last.
