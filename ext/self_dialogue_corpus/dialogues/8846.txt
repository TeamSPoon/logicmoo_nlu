Do you remember the song "I Remember You?"
Yeah, that was Skid Row, right?
Yeah, I was trying to remember who that was by.
I always liked that song.
Me too.  It was just basic.
Yeah, I know what you mean.  No frills.
I liked the sound of the guitar on it.
Yeah, it sounded nice.
What other songs did they have?
There was Youth Gone Wild, but I don't really remember many more.
