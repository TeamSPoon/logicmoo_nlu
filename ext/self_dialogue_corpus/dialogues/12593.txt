Did you see the first Star Wars movie?
From the prequel trilogy?
Yeah, the Phantom Menace.
I did see that one, I liked the actor they chose for young Anakin.
Me too, he did a good job.
I was not a big fan of the animation though.
I kind of liked it, it would've been hard to do those racing scenes without animation.
That's true, I can't think of how they would've done it with older effects.
I think that movie was the best out of all the prequel movies.
I agree, that once was my favorite out of those three.
