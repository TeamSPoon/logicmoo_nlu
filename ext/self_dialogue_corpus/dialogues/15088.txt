I have seen so many comedies.
I bet you have not seen all of them.
Try me.
Have you seen Abbot and Costello Meet Frankenstein?
No, I have not
Well, that is one of the funniest movies ever made and it also blends horror into it.
Who is in it?
Bud Abbot and Lou Costello.
When was it made?
In the late 40's. It's black and white.
