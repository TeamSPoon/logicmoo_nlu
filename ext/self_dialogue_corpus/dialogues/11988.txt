Do you prefer the new Star wars, the old Star Wars or the ones in the middle?
I think the old star wars, Luke, Leai and Hans, are best.
They had a good bit of story to dig into.
It was the relationships, like Han and Leai, the slow burn into love.
Their relationship really played out well, I was invested.
The witty come back between the two always made me smile, like they really did like one another.
I like that they came from world apart.
Yes, he was a bit of a scoundrel and her a princess, it was a wrong side of the tracks love.
Did you like the part when he was about to be frozen and she said she loved him.
And he said, "I know", got me everytime.
