I want to go see the the new Baywatch movie.
No, do you really?
Yes. I used to love the show when I was younger.
Oh the movie looks horrible!
I think it looks good.
Who is in the movie?
Zach Effron is the main character.
I am not too sure about his acting.
I have not ssen much with him in it.
All I know about him is he is in a lot of teen movies.
I don't really care about the actors much, I just like the nostalgia about it.
Ah, I see what you mean.
I'll be sure to let you know how it is.
Oh please do. I can't wait to find out.
Are you planning on seeing anything good?
Snatched looks good.
That has Goldie Hawn in it, right?
Yes and Amy Poelher.
I like them both.
They are pretty funny.
