What do you think about Metallica releasing a new album?
I have enjoyed their music in the past, but some of it has not been very good.
Yes, I agree. They are also getting up their in age.
I wonder if their age will change the sound of their music.
I wouldn't think it would, but maybe. Things changed as you age.
Yeah, sometimes things you like when your younger, you don't care so much for as you get older.
True, that can be said about a lot of things.
I just hope it's not as bad as some of their more recent albums.
Yeah, I wish they would get back to the way they were during the Black album or And Justice for All.
Aren't you forgetting Master of Puppets?
Well yeah, I also meant that album.
So do you think you will pick it up when it comes out.
Probably, after I listen to some of it online first.
Yeah, I don't want to buy something that I am going to hate.
Well, I doubt I would hate the entire album either way, but I would like to enjoy more of it than I hate.
That can not be said about some of their past albums, like Load and Reload.
God, those were terrible.
That is what I am afraid they are going to release this time, quality wise.
I am sure they learn their lesson after those two albums.
One can only hope.
