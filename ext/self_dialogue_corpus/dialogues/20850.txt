What did you think of the new Guardians of the Galaxy movie?
Eh, okay I guess.
Just okay?
Just okay.  It wasn't bad by any means, but I felt they left a lot of meat on the bone.
Explain what you mean.
Sure.  It seems that they rushed the script out.
You mean that they didn't try very hard to make a good picture?
I think there were different plots they could have come up with to make it more meaningful.
Kurt Russell's character was going to end a whole bunch of worlds.
Right, but the premise was kind of ridiculous.
What did you think of the comedy?
Too much like the first one.  Again, it just felt rushed.
I do get that angle a bit.  At times, I felt like I was watching the first one.
And there's nothing wrong with using good elements of the first, but you have to be careful.
What did you think of Baby Groot?
Indifferent.  I mean, it was an interesting take, hated how they made him stupid.
You mean the scene near the end to blow everything up?
Exactly.  They completely butchered the entire ending.
Those are all valid points.  Wonder what they'll do in the next one.
They're making another?  Goodness me, they won't stop.
