Do you know much about the story throughout the Star Wars universe?
I really don't. I feel like it's too much to keep up with.
As a die-hard Star Wars fan, I completely understand that.
How are you able to keep up with everything?
The films just appeal to me. Nothing too specific.
You just like the movies overall?
Yeah, and it's been that way since I was a child.
Could you explain the story to me a bit?
I could, if it was simple enough to summarize 8 movies.
That's a lot of movies.
