I am going to a concert this weekend, a music concert.
Who are you going to see?
I am going to see Bruno Mars.
Cool! Where is he playing?
He is playing down at Koka Booth in Cary.
That should be sold out!
Yes, they are expecting to have to have people sit in the grass as well as the entire stadium.
Paul Simon was there last weekend.
Really, that's awesome. I didn't get to see that performance.
Paul looks a little bit older now, I noticed.  But he can still rock a crowd!
Bruno Mars is wonderful on stage, it should be a great show.
Fantastic! Maybe I can go with you!
What are some of your favorite Bruno Mars songs?
Funktown is my favorite song of his, That's What I like, and Marry You too.
Yes,  I can't! I have front row tickets!
Oh my gosh!  How much did that cost!
Too much! Each ticket cost $80 and that does not include snacks , drinks etc.
I know you will enjoy it though.
Yes, the show will be unbelieveable at that seating.
Enjoy your show!
