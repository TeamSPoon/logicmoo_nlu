Remember when Calvin Klein was the big designer to buy years ago?
Yes but now it's Gucci, AG and J Brand jeans that are popular.
True Religion are some of the most expensive jeans you can buy today.
Yes, those and Miss Me is what all the young people are wearing.
Funny thing, older people seem to like NYDJ.
What does NYDJ stand for?
It means "Not Your Daughter's Jeans."
I have never heard of those. I remember Levis was the only jeans anyone would wear.
i remember there was a company that put your own name on your jeans.
So I could become an instant designer?
Yeah, and Amazon Merch allows you create and sell your own T shirt designs.
I bet you and I could make a lot of money cerating and selling T Shirts on Amazon.
You got any ideas.
Yeah, what about "Dump The Trump?"
Hey, that 's pretty good and I bet it will sell.
I don't know I just thought of that.
That's how people become millionares in this country.
How do I get a copyright for my idea?
Go online, Google Copyright office and download the forms.
I think I will. Look Amazon here I come!
