What do you think of heavy metal?
I like the classics, like Metallica, Megadeath, Slayer, and the like.
Yes, I enjoy those bands. I don't like the screamo or death metal stuff you hear today.
What's your favorite album?
Probably Metallica's ...And Justice for All.
That's a good one. I like the Black Album myself.
A lot of people think that's where Metallica began to sell out, but it has some of their best songs.
Agreed. Enter Sandman is still a favorite of mine and all time great album opener.
I don't think the themes were as unified as in Justice, but it's still a really good album.
It was better than Kill 'em All, at least. That one was a little raw.
Yes, it was their first album. So that's to be expected.
Have you listened to their recent stuff?
I haven't heard the latest album, but I did like Death Magnetic.
Yeah, I thought it was a return to form for them.
It was definitely a message to those who thought they couldn't perform like they used to in the days of Master of Puppets.
Have you ever seen them in concert?
Yeah, but it was around the turn of the century and they refused to play any of their classic stuff.
That's a bummer.
It was still a good concert, though.
I need to make it to one. They're getting older, so who knows how long they'll keep touring.
