Hey do you like Ice Hockey?
Yeah, my favorite team is the Predators. Do you like Ice Hockey?
Yeah, the predators are really good this year. I can't believe what they did to the black hawks.
Wow, that was crazy, right? Who would of thought?
I certainly didn't expect it, but I was happy for them.
Yeah the organization deserves it. They've been hungry for some success for awhile.
Yeah, I know how that feels. I am a Sabres fan.
Oh, well you guys keep looking better. Lots of good prospects.
Yeah I just can't wait for them to do something in this league.
Give it a few years. Lots of good things ahead.
I hope the Predators do good in the playoffs.
Yeah, i'm hoping to atleast get to the finals.
Im sure you guys will. That conference banner will look great in the arena.
Oh, I forgot about that.
Yeah I love those cermonies when they raise it.
They always look so big when they are closer to the ground.
Right? You think they have to iron it before it goes up?
Well you don't want a wrinkled banner in your arena for years and years do you?
Not at all. I bet it takes ten people and ten irons.
I bet they blow like 3 fuses trying to do it.
