Do you like the rock group, Yes?
You mean the band named Yes? Yes, I do.
For many years in my childhood they were my favorite band, and pretty much the only music I ever listened to.
I was a big fan of them also during their hayday. I've often wondered what other bands were in the same league with their creativity and ability.
I think if you are a Yes fan, you should check out some of the solo albums and other spinoff albums that were done by the members of the group.
Is that so? I wasn't aware of those works.
In particular, the solo albums by Bill Bruford, Rick Wakeman and Chris Squire are very good.
Really? Which ones would you recommend?
Rick Wakeman's Journey to the Center of the Earth is well known, and he did an album called No Earthly Connection, which is really terrific.
What about Chris Squire? He was the base player, right?
Yes, but he did a really good album that sounds a lot like Yes. It was called Fish out of Water.
That's nice to know. What about Bill Bruford?
Bill Bruford is definitely one of the greatest drummers to ever play in a rock band. He created some great jazz-rock fusion albums, although it bares no resemblance to the Yes sound.
He was also the drummer for King Crimson, wasn't he?
Yes. For a while, after he left Yes, he played with King Crimson.
What do his solo albums sound like?
It sounds mostly like jazz, but the instrumentation and structure is somewhat rock influenced. It seems he is primarily a Jazz artist.
I haven't gotten into jazz-rock fusion very much, but I do like jazz and progressive rock in general.
If that's the case you should definitely give Bill Bruford a try. My favorite song of his is "One of a Kind" of the same titled album.
Good suggestion. Next time I'm on Spotify I'll give it a go.
