What's your favorite movie?
I get asked that a lot but never have a good answer. Probably Juno.
Oh cool, that one is so funny.
Yeah, the writing is really great. It won the Oscar for Best Screenplay.
No way! Who wrote it?
Her name is Diablo Cody, she's super cool.
That's so cool. I really like Ellen Page, too.
Yeah, she's so good. What's that new one she's in?
Flatliners, I think it's called.
Yes! That looks weird, but it's a cool concept.
You're right, I can't really tell what genre they're going for.
Me neither. It seems like horror for a lot of the trailer.
Yeah that's probably it.
Nina Dobrev is in it, too.
Oh, she's been in another creepy movie I think.
Which one?
It's called The Roommate, from 2011.
Oh cool, what's it rated?
PG-13, according to Wikipedia.
Great, my little brother can watch it with me, then.
