Have you ever seen The Princess Diaries?
Yes, I have. I was Anne Hathaway's first movie wasn't it?
I think so. She was really funny in it.
I loved the makeover scene.
Yeah, before her makeover it was so convincing that she was average looking.
She's definitely not average looking.
They made a sequel to it but I didn't like it.
Yeah, the whole concept of forcing her to marry someone put me off.
She found a good guy in the end though.
Only through luck. I liked the guy she was with in the first movie but they totally got rid of him for Chris Pine.
