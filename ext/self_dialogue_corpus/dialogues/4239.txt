Whats been the best thriller movie you ever saw?
Mystic River was the best.
Would you call that a thriller.
Yeah the hunt for the murderer was epic.
What would you say was the best scene.
Where Sean Penn is about to kill Tim Robbins.
Thats nuts that you would think that.
Its an amazing story.
Is it based on fact?
That I do not think.
