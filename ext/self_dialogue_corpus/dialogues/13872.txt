I think it's cool that you're a Lady Gaga fan too. You know, when I first saw her I dismissed her as a gimmick act, but the more I see her, the more impressed I am.
Oh I love her. She's so talented.  Did you see her performance at the Oscars? Was that unexpected or what?
Yes!  Who knew she had that range.  Obviously she's had classical training.
Not really my favorite performance, but she got to show another side and how talented she is.
Did you see the interview she did with Barbara Walters? It was her and her mother at home?  She was so real.
No, I missed that, but I bet it's on Youtube... I'll give it a look.
I have to be careful of I get Poker Face playing on a loop in my head LOL...My, my, my poker face...my, my, poker face. LOL. Definitely my favorite...today anyway haha.
You're funny.  Did you know she wrote that? She writes her own songs.  Very few entertainers can say that...she's a pianist too.
Yes, Gaga's a total performer for sure...next she'll conquer Hollywood. You know with those stage performances that she can act.
She's a total talent package for sure. Lady G is going to be with us for a long, long time and I can't wait to watch.
