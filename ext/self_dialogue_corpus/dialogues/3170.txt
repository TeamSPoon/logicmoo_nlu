I'm really excited about the Raiders this season.
Are they moving to Las Vegas yet?
Not yet, that won't be until 2020.
For some reason I thought it was going to be next year. Either way, I'm also excited about the Raiders this season.
They overachieved last year and were looking really good until the unfortunate Derek Carr injury.
That was the turning point for their season. Derek Carr is so good.
I agree, he was the heart and soul of their team and I think when he went down the sails went out on their season.
It didn't help that the backup quarterback also got hurt.
Yeah that late in the season going into the post season playoffs was rough with that situation.
I thought Michael Crabtree looked really good too.
He definitely had a resurgence and Derek Carr certainly made him look good.
The Raiders defense was so good last year! I hope they were able to maintain and keep everyone.
The key defensive players are intact and they also added Jelani Jenkins.
Jelani was on the Dolphins last year right.
Yeah he was on the Dolphins. He'll help solidify their linebacker core.
What about offense aren't you excited about Cordarrelle Patterson and Jared Cook along with of course the BEAST, Marshawn Lynch?
That's obviously excitement from me without question. I'm also really pleased with the signing of EJ Manuel as a backup quarterback in case of something unfortunate happening again.
Oh that's right they also picked up EJ. That's a smart move especially since backup quarterback was so thin in depth for them last season.
I'm looking forward to the season as I expect the Raiders to be on top of the division again. I don't see the Denver Broncos, Chargers being much of a threat, but the Kansas City Chiefs will be tough again.
It'll be a fun season out there in the AFC West again, it'll be exciting.
