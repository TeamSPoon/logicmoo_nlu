What's your favorite Disney movie?
I always liked Finding Nemo alot.
Is that the movie with the fish?
Yeah, it's a pretty heartwarming movie.
How was it a heartwarming movie?
I almost cried when the fish got captured.
Honestly, I might have cried as well.
I know it was rough seeing humans with the fish.
They saw them as food and tried to capture them.
That's what made the fishes' journey so difficult.
