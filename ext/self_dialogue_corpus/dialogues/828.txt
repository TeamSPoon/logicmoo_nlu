I love the Vikings to be a sleeper team this year.
Really? With Sam Bradford as their QB?
Bradford is a solid QB. Their line didn't play the best last year.
True, I like the addition of Reif.  He adds a dimension of toughness.
Besides Patterson, they didn't lose any players to free agency.
What are you talking about? They lost the greatest running back of all-time - Adrian Peterson.
I agree that he WAS a great player.  He's been injured lately and is at the end of his career.
Don't count AP out, I bet he runs for 1,200 yards and 12 touchdowns in New Orleans this year.
He's washed up and will be out of the league in two years.
I think he holds on and breaks the rushing record in five years.
Besides, the Vikes drafted Delvin Cook to replace AP.
Cook is decent, but do you think he will be any good in the NFL.
I think he wins the rookie of the year, has 1,500 combined yards and 10 tds.
Pretty high expectations for a rookie running back!
I also, love the Vikings defense, one of the best in the league.
They didn't play that great at the end of the year last year.
They were on the field a lot, so they were tired.
So your'e saying that the Vikes will be better on offense and their defense returns to form?
Exactly
I could see that.
