Freaky Friday is so funny.
Are you talking about the older or newer movie?
The newer one with Jamie Lee Curtis and Lindsay Lohan.
Oh. That movie cracks me up.
I love when the Grandpa runs out of the house because he thinks there's an earthquake.
I know. The relationship between the grandpa and the little brother is great.
The relatuonship between Anna and her little brother is sweet too.
I know. It was so nice when Anna found out how much he really loves her.
I agree. I wish Lindsay Lohan would get back into acting because she had so many great parts in that movie.
She shows so much talent when she makes a toast and says she's happy her mom is marrying Ryan.
That part always brings tears to my eyes.
Me too. It has a lot of emotional scenes for being a comedy.
I know, and I always forget that it was produced by Disney.
Really? I thought it might have been produced by Universal Studios or something.
Nope, Disney.
Well that explains why I like it so much. I always enjoy Disney movies.
Me too. I really want to see the new Beauty and the Beast movie.
I saw it in theaters. It was phenomenal.
Aw. you're so lucky.
Don't worry. It just came out on DVD.
