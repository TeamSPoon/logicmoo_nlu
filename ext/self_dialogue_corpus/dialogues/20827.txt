What's your favorite movie?
Back to the Future
That was an awesome movie.
How did Spielberg get his genius?
He is so creative.
I love time travel movies so much.
I like all the Back to the Future movies because they are so entertaining.
They hold you in suspense, but also make you laugh.
I wish they'd make more Back to the Future movies.
Me too, I just don't know if the originals can be topped.
Which Back to the Future movie do you like best?
I like part III when they travelled to the wild west.
That was fun.  Doc was funny when he had the two kids Jules and Verne.
I couldn't look away from the screen at any point in those movies.  They captivated me.
Me as well.  They were so entertaining.
What movies do you hope to see this summer?
I hope to see the new Cars 3 movie with my kids.
That's going to be great.
I want to see Beauty and the Beast on DVD as well.
I saw the play for that recently.  I hope the remake with live characters is just as good.
