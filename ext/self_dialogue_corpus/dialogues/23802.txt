Have you seen any good movies lately?
Yeah! I saw the new Wonder Woman movie and it was awesome!
Oh really? My mom and her boyfriend went to see it a couple Sundays ago and they seemed to really like it.
Yeah, you should definitely see it. The story is interesting, it has great action, and I loved the actors/actresses.
Sweet, I think pretty much everyone I've talked to has enjoyed it and the reviews seem to be really good.
Yeah, definitely. How about you, have you seen any good movies lately?
Unfortunately, it's been a little while since I've been to the theaters, but I did watch Batman vs. Superman recently.
Oh cool, another comic book related movie. How was it?
It was great. I've liked all the recent batman movies, but it's a little hard for me to believe that Batman could realistically take on Superman.
Well yeah, but Batman has all the cool gadgets and he's incredibly smart.
True, but I'd still rather have super powers. One movie I really want to see is Baby Driver.
I think I've seen an ad or two for it, but I don't know much about it.
I don't really know a ton about it either, but it looks like a lot of fun. It looks like it's got a good mix of action and comedy.
Yeah, I'll have to check it out sometime.
Yeah, Jamie Foxx seems like he's going to be hilarious in that movie. I definitely want to see it.
This might sound random, but do you know if they're coming out with another Star Wars movie?
I think they are. I think there's going to be another trilogy.
I saw the original 6 movies and I recently watched The Force Awakens, but I haven't seen Rogue One.
I've seen the first 6 Star Wars movie as well, but I haven't seen either of the latest two. I want to though.
Yeah, you should. Star Wars movies don't typically disappoint.
