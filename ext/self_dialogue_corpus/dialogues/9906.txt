Will Snoop ever release another album?
Doubt it why does he need to
To show he can still rap
He has alot of other business ventures.
Are any of them worth talking about
Like on an album?
No just in general, like Jay Z had production companies and a streaming service.
I dont know what you could say really.
he does do guest spots on albums
Yeah but thats not nearly the same
