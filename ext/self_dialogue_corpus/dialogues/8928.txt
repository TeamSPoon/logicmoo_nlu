I'm not sure why I always see people complain about Weezer's new stuff.
Same, I think they've been a really consistent band.
A lot of people seem to want them to just put out samey stuff unforutnately.
Which is a shame because they have evolved in so many ways and they're always interesting.
Agreed, Rivers Cuomo is very good as exploring new sounds.
Some people feel though that if you're in one genre you have to stay there.
I can definitely see why some people might not like Thank God For Girls.
Yeah it has a modern pop sound that Weezer isn't typically known for.
But that's also what makes it so good right?
I agree and I am always looking forward to what they put out next.
