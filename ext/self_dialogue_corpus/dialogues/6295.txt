What Disney movie, would you love to see a sequel to?
Moana, definitely.
I'm sure with its popularity, it will get one. Disney milks that dollar.
Yes, but they also put out quality sequels.
Not always!
I think with Moana that they will.
Yeah. I loved the the cinematography of Moana. It really was beautiful.
I felt like I was at the ocean. It almost made me nervous.
I know what you mean! When they were on that little boat in the ocean, I felt like I was there too.
I would be so scared if I really was!
