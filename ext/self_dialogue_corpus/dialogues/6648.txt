Did you get Beauty and the Beast on DVD?
Blu-Ray actually.  Emma Watson's voice sounds more beautiful on it?
Really?  I wouldn't think it would matter.
It sounds even crisper and more lovely to my ears.
Wow, interesting to know.
And the Beast's Evermore also sounds better.  I recommend it.
I love that song!  So heartbreaking.
And Dan Stevens sings it with such emotion.
Just thinking about it makes me want to cry!
Me too!
