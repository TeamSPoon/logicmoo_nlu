Did you listen to the ocarina cover of the Steven Universe theme I sent you?
Yeah I did, it was great! How did you find it?
It was a recommended video to me on youtube because I listened to other ocarina songs.
What do you like about ocarinas?
Well it was my favourite part of the game, Ocarina of Time, and I really like the aesthetics of ocarinas. Especially sweet potato ocarinas.
Sweet potato?
Yeah, the kind of bulbous ocarinas that you hold sideways?
Like in the game, right?
Yeah. So aesthetically those are my favourite, but I find the inline ocarinas easier to play.
You play?
Yeah! I haven't gotten very good yet, but I got a polycarbonate inline ocarina from Mountain Ocarinas.
You should play for me sometime.
I definitely will. It's a higher pitched ocarina and I love the way it lends itself to jigs, making cheerful noise and for the sadder songs, it adds somewhat of an eerie feel.
Very interesting. Are there other kinds of ocarinas?
Oh yes, lots. There are pendant ocarinas, which are the smallest and highest pitched and also some of the prettiest, there are ocarinas made from vegetables and even an ocarina and teacup in one!
Pendant ocarinas as in you can wear them as a necklace?
That's right. Mine is bigger but it comes with a neck cord anyway.
What kind of music do you play on it?
Zelda songs, Irish songs, hymns... they've been used for just about every style of music imagineable though.
It seems they are very versatile.
