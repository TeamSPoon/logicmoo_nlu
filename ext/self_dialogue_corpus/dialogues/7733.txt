Heard you finally finished watching Harry Potter & The Goblet of Fire. What did you think?
I think the movies are starting to get a little too far removed from the books. What did you think?
Yeah I thought so too, but the actors are all great. So what can we do?
My point exactly! Emma Watson and Katie Leung were my favorites.
Seeing the visuals have really reinforced the book imagery for me. It's kind of hard to picture faces and places you've never been to before.
Yep, especially the costumes. It's also hard to imagine the magical creatures J.K. Rowling dreamed up.
I also liked the intensity of Voldemort coming back to life. It's harder to get scared reading a book.
The comedy was funnier too. Ron's dress robes were especially hilarious.
So when you gonna watch number Order of The Phoenix? Anytime soon?
I was thinking of buying all eight movies on Blu-ray and maybe marathon it this weekend. Come over if you want, it's supposed to make more sense watching them all back-to-back-to-back.
