Are you ready for some good old hard-hitting football?
I've waited long enough.
What are you expecting to see this coming season?
I really want to see whether some of these young quarterbacks bounce back or progress.
Which ones specifically?
I'd like to see Winston and Newton can take over the league
I think Winston definitely has the higher probably of progressing this season.
You don't think Cam can bounce back?
I really feel like he's overrated in a way and people definitely hypes him far too much?
How so?
If you look at his previous season outside of his Superbowl season he really hasn't had that great of a career.
Yeah, that is true. People definitely did treat him like he was the best quarterback in the league.
I also think Jameis is a much better leader. He is a lot more relaxed.
I can't disagree. Cam definitely looks a lot more frail when you look at his press conferences.
I think Cam has great potential, but he needs to drop the antics and play ball.
Ever since that Superbowl loss it looks like he never really got it back together.
That and to be honest their team that year had a lot of luck in my opinion. You don't see a lot of Superbowl teams with that bad of an offensive line.
Both teams that season had terrible o-lines, but I guess it speaks volume to how important  good running and a great defense is.
Yeah, I agree, but notice both teams fell apart this season for that very same reason. Their porous o-lines caused poor quarterback play.
Definitely! Ultimately, I think the Bucs and Jameis will progress significantly, because they have an awesome o-line and even more weapons on offense. I look forward to seeing the results.
