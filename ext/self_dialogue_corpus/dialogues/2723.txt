Are you ready for the NFL season to start?
Not really, I am not that into football to be honest.
Why?
Because everything about it just seems overrated. Kind of like Soccor.
How do you figure?
Well the season is 16 weeks unless you make the playoffs correct?
17 weeks, with 16 games. Teams get 1 week off during the season.
Ok. Even worse. In that time, they play a total of 16 games? 1 game a week.
Yes, and then they practice the rest of the week.
And during a game they stand around while the clock is running, so in all they play like 20 minutes a game.
There is a strategy to when the clock is running, and how the team is going to handle it.
Ok, sure. But in the NHL 20 minutes is actual game play. The clock stops when the teams are not playing
The NHL and NFL are completely different. The NFL is harder hits and scrums.
Oh please! Players in the NHL are routinely going to the dressing room for stitches during the game.
Try lining up against a 250 pound guy and keeping him away from your quarterback.
How about trying to pass the puck when the other team is planting you into the glass.
That is why they practice daily though. So they can try and figure out every play the other team will use.
NHL usually plays 2 to 3 games a week. Try remembering which city you are in.
Guy, Football is a great sport with lots of excitement.
I am just saying that NHL is better. Football is too slow.
