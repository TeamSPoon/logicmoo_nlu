Hey, have you seen the movie Gone Girl?
Not yet, but it's on my list!  I actually just finished the book.
Oh, you should totally see the movie!  It's great!
Is it similar to the book?
Yeah, it's really similar.  But it's still worth seeing because the way they portray the characters is great.
That's what I heard.  It does kinda ruin it to know the ending though.
Well, yeah.  It reduces the suspense, but you'll still enjoy it.
I loved Gone Girl, but The Girl on the Train was just as good.
Oh, I haven't seen that one yet!
Yeah, it's great.  It's also really similar to the book but it's neat seeing the characters in the movie like you said.
I'll have to check that out.  I loved the book almost as much as Gone Girl.
I liked it even better.  It was more intriguing to me and the characters were more likable.
Well, it sounds like I need to check out the Girl on the Train and you need to check out Gone Girl.
True!  Have you seen any of Gillian Flynn's other movies?
No, not yet.  I know there is a movie for Dark Places, but I haven't heard of any others.
Yeah, I saw Dark Places on Amazon Prime but I haven't watched it yet.  The book was great.
Yeah, the book really was great.  I'm not sure how good the movie would be though.
Someone told me it was good, so I've been meaning to watch it.
It seems like the book is always better than the movie.
Well that's usually the case no matter what.
