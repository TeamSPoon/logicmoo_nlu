Have you heard that they are making a Broadway musical of Frozen?
Wow, that's great! I love Broadway musicals!
I hope they add more songs. I love the ones that are there already, of course, especially "Let It Go."
I think my favorite is "For the First Time in Forever."
It's interesting, though. I wonder if the Elsa they choose will be able to top Idina Menzel.
Or Kristen Bell? But I didn't even know that she could sing before she played Anna.
I wonder how they will do the parts with Sven talking with Kristoff.
Yeah, obviously they won't use a live animal, but a costume for a person, maybe?
And would Olaf be a costume or a puppet?
Because of his size, I think a puppet might work better, but who knows?
