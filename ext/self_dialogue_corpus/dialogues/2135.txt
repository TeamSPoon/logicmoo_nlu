NFL is about to start.  Are you excited?
Oh yeah, pre-season starts in about a month.
Pre-season? Nah I don't watch those games.
Why not?  You usually get to see the newly drafted rookies play.
Yeah, but it's just not very exciting with nothing at stake.
True.  I agree pre-season is a bit too long too.
Maybe 2 games per team max.  They are just trying to milk airtime for advertising money.
What you can do.  it's big business.  I can't wait to see Brees back in action though.
They drafted some defense to help protect Brees
I sure hope so.  They can't keep trying to outscore opponents.
Yeah remember that game between the Saints and the Giants?
That was nuts.  Scored like 50+ points each.
How ironic the game ends on a field goal though haha.
Yeah very funny.  Defense hasn't improved much since that game.
Still giving up way too many points and Brees probably only have 1 or 2 good years left.
This is his last stand.  They are not like the Patriots who are stacked on D.
Yeah that gives Brady a few extra years before he retires.
Yup, just comes out throws accurately and scores fast so he can rest.
Brady gets sacked way less than Brees cause of it.
Either way, should be a good year for the Saints.  Hope that D fulfills their promise.
