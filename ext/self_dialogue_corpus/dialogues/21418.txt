Are there any movies that you'll always watch if they're on?
Oh yeah! There are lots that fit that bill.
For me, it's Happy Gilmore, or Billy Madison, or any of the early Adam Sandler movies.
My answer is kind of similar - It's the early Judd Apatow movies. 40 Year old Virgin, Knocked Up, Superbad.
I think those might be better movies than the Adam Sandler movies, but I think the Sandler ones are more re-watchable.
Because they don't even try to be serious at all?
Yeah, I think so. It's just pure goofy fun.
Speaking of pure goofy fun, what about Stepbrothers.
That movie didn't really do it for me.
That surprises me - Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly killed it in that movie!
I guess. It just got too weird for me at a certain point.
It was definitely weird, but I thought it was hilarious.
Maybe I just come from an earlier generation of comedies. I've never been as into the Apatow or Adam McKay movies as you.
That might be what it is.
I will probably always watch Shawshank Redemption, thinking about serious movies rather than comedies.
For sure, me too. That one is a classic.
Pretty much any movie with Morgan Freeman narrating is worth watching.
His voice is so amazing and resonant.
I still think my #1 re-watchable movie is Happy Gilmore, though.
And for me, it's Knocked Up.
