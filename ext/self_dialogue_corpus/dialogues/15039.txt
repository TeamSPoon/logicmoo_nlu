So what are we gonna watch tonight?
How about a comedy movie? I've got Ghostbusters, Space Jam, The Great Muppet Caper...
Which Ghostbusters? I heard there's a new one.
The original.
And Space Jam...that's the one with Michael Jordan and the Looney Tunes, right?
That's right.
Hmmm...I'm not sure whether I wanna see Space Jam or The Great Muppet Caper.
I've got a few others, if you wanna see.
Nah. I guess I'm in a Muppet mood.
Alright. The Great Muppet Caper it is, then.
