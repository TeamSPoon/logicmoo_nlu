Have you ever been to a Billy Joel concert?
Oh no but I really wanted to!
Me neither but I hear he puts on a good show.
Like he gives his all to the audience.
He's an outstanding piano player.
Well he is the Piano Man.
And kind of a regular guy.
Yes I think he's had his ups and downs.
More than most maybe.
I know what you mean. To me his earliest music is best.
To my ear, its all catchy.
There's something to it, I don't know what.
I think he's inventive with the piano.
Wonder how he got his start.
He played piano from a young age.
And his dad was a classical pianist.
He was a good role model.
Plus a lot to live up to, I imagine.
Ray Charles was also another influence on his piano playing.
Who inducted him into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame!
