Have you seen any new movies lately?
Yea, I saw Fate of The Furious
How was it?
Not that good in my opinion
What was wrong with it?
Too over the top for me
Yea, it seemed liked that from the trailers.
The series is getting to far away from its roots
There are a lot of explosions and I think I saw tanks in the trailer
Yea, it all went down hill when they lost Paul Walker
It's sad how much I miss an actor I've never met.
Yea movies can make you feel like you know a person well.
I also have seen the new wonderwoman
Yea, I saw it too. Thoughts?
The acting was really good!
I liked the setting and the story
The actress, Gal Gadot was terrific
New movies with superheros are doing really well this year!
Yea, lets ignore Batman vs Superman and hope the trend continues
I love batman movies, but yea superman sucks.
