Have you listened to any Belle and Sebastian?
Can't say I have, are they a duo?
No they're a Scottish indie band, they're pretty good.
Why are they called that if there's more than two people? That's silly.
I think they're named after a French something, a kids' book maybe?
Bit of a weird name if you ask me.
Forget the name, listen to the music!
Woah, it looks like they've recorded a bunch of stuff. Where do I even start?
Well, "If You're Feeling Sinister" is their most famous album, and the track of the same name is probably a good intro.
Alright, I'll give that a listen.
But it depends what you're into
Just anything interesting.
Maybe you should try "Electronic Renaissance" then.
What's that?
A track from their first album, "Tigermilk". It's a bit quirky.
Okay, I'll try that.
How do you like it?
I recognise the intro. Is it a remix of something?
Pachelbel's Canon
Of course.
