What do you think of pop music?
I don't really listen to it because every song is about love and I hate love.
There has to be some people you like.
I do really like Ed Sheeran because is songs are great.
What songs do you like?
I like "That's what I like" a lot.
So I see you listen to some pop music.
Yes I do listen to some of it just not on a regular basis.
There are lots of great songs to be discovered.
I think I will get more into it.
