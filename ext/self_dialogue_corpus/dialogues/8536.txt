Who do you think has the best voice in pop music?
That's a toss up. Either Christina Aguilera or Mariah Carey.
Those are both really strong choices.
Definitely. They both have a massive range.
Mariah can hit some insane notes. I think Christina has more style, though.
Yeah, in Mariah's song "Emotions" she hits some ear piercing notes.
That song is really old but great.
I agree. It's probably in her top 3 best songs.
What's your favorite song from Christina?
I always liked "Beautiful". It had a really powerful message.
