What's your favorite star wars ship?
I like the U-Wing.
Why that one?
Because it's fast, has plenty of room and looks like it would be fun to fly.
What about the Millennium Falcon?
I don't know.  It looks like a piece of junk.
Are you quoting Han Solo?
I'm trying to.
Don't you think Harrison Ford is so old?
Yes, it's scary to see him in those movies.  I don't want him to get hurt.
