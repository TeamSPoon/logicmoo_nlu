I love Carole King.
She's really an oldie.
Yes, ever since the 60s, with her husband Gerry Coffin.
What did she write then?
She wrote Up on the Roof.
Wow, I did not know that.
She also wrote One Fine Day.
Amazing.  Anything else?
You Make Me Feel Like a Natural Woman.
I thought Aretha Franklin wrote that. I am shocked.
