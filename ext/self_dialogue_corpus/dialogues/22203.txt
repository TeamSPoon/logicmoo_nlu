O.K., last time we talked about Brooklyn and simple movies, but you must have liked some blockbusters through the years.
I suppose.
Well, give me some of your favorites.
O.K., but first you can't get down on me if they are not from this century.
O.K., blockbusters from any era, but I won't give you Birth of the Nation or even Ben Hur or Cleopatra.
All right--I'm not sure exactly what a blockbuster is--let's say high budget movies and ones in somewhat recent memory.
I'll accept the ground rules.
Star Wars and Indiana Jones movies.
Not that recent.
Not to start with, but they're still going.
True, I just saw the recent Star Wars film--is Harrison Ford still doing Indy?
Not sure, but if he can't land his plane on the right runway...
All right, so we are all getting old.
I liked Independence Day and Titanic.
O.K. still not that recent.
The problem I have with most of the recent big budget action movies is they're based on comic books.
Were you not into comic books.
Actually, no, so I can't relate to most of the characters.
Yes and I think that character development is the most important thing in any movie.
I think you're on to something there; we';
