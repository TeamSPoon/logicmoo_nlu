Have you heard the new album from The Fleet Foxes?
I just saw them perform a song on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert. Is their new album good?
I would say it is okay but not as good as their last album Helplessness Blues.
There does seem to be a lot of good new albums coming out recently. Have you heard Lourde's new album Melodrama?
I saw her perform Green Light on Saturday Night Live and I thought that was a catchy song.
Apparently she recorded a lot of the album in Lena Dunham's living room.
I did hear that she writes a lot of her songs with help from Lena Dunham's husband who is in the band Fun.
Speaking of Saturday Night Live, I saw Harry Styles perform on there a few months ago and was very impressed.
His new album reminds me a lot of Beck's earlier work. I like how there is so much diversity in style between each track.
I'm looking forward to going to the upcoming music festival called Lou Fest.
Which bands are performing this year?
The headliners include Weezer, Snoop Dogg, Run the Jewels, and Huey Lewis and the News.
That's a funny combination. I have heard lots of good things about Run the Jewels but haven't gotten into their music yet.
I'd recommend checking them out. They have lots of strong political messages behind their songs.
That's what I've heard. I think Bernie Sanders is even a fan of them.
Are there any other new releases you would recommend checking out?
Imagine Dragons has a new album coming that should be good.
It will be interesting to see if they can score a hit as big as their last one Radioactive.
I heard them being interviewed on the radio and talking about why they took a hiatus after so many years of touring.
I bet a lot of bands get burned out after touring for so long. That's good they were able to take a break for awhile.
