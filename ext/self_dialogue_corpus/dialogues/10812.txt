My favorite Fast and Furious movie has to be number 6.
That one is my least favorite.
Really? It's one of the better ones in my opinion.
There's a slightly personal reason as to why I don't like it.
Go on.
I saw less than half of it when my family went to watch it in the theaters.
Why so little?
Because I ate something beforehand that upset my stomach badly.
So you spent more than half of the movie in the bathroom?
Unfortunately, that's how it went.
