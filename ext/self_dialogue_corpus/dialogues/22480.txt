I'm not sure how I feel about them making another sequel to Toy Story.
Yeah they kind of ended it pretty well with Toy Story 3.
It was a great cap on the nostalgia for those who grew up with the series.
Though I think people were apprehensive about 3 too and that turned out good.
True, Pixar can generally do no wrong, they're pretty solid.
Yeah even if it's not as good as past entries there's no doubt it will still be a good movie.
But it's Toy Story I feel like there's a standard there, it needs to be great.
We're talking about a movie that is about talking toys.
Yeah but it's more than just that, there's a message, like all of their movies.
I suppose so, but they're largely marketed towards kids.
And that's the beauty of it, the depth that exists within them even though they're marketed at kids.
That is definitely a thing I like about animated movies these days.
Yeah there's a lot of subtext in even stuff like Zootopia.
Speaking of, Zootopia was an instant classic.
Yeah we're pretty spoiled when it comes to animated movies these days.
No kidding, Moana was another stupdendous flick.
Disney is still churning out the goods, even if they aren't hand drawn like people want.
I have nothing wrong with CGI animation these days, people need to get with the times.
Even though the cartoon Disney movies were beautiful.
Yeah I can't disagree there.
