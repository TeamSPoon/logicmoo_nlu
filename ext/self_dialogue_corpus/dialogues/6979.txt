What did you think about Moana?
I thought it was wonderful!
What did you like best about it?
I loved the meaning of it and the female empowerment.
I agree with you, I would love to watch it with my girls.
Let me know what they think of the song "How Far I'll Go?"
Will do! I heard the soundtrack is wonderful.
Oh yes, the songs will stick in your head for days.
Thats what makes Disney movies so great.
Well said.
