What's been up with Taylor Swift? I haven't heard about her in a while.
She's been out of the spotlight this year. I think that she was doing ads for Diet Coke and the Sony digital camera.
I know a while back that she donated $100,000 to the Red Cross for the victims of that flood in Iowa.
She made the top 100 celebrity list in Forbes magazine last year.
I subscribe to Forbes too. They reported her as one of the top earning female musicians.
10 Grammy Awards and she's only 27.
Her pop cross over stuff did great. When I was in Texas, they played "Love Story" on the rock stations.
At the gym, they play "Shake it Off" all the time.
I think the album that song is on, 1989, sold 6 million copies.
The concert tour for 1989 was one of the highest money makers of this decade.
