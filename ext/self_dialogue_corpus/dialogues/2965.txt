Who are the best kickers in the NFL?
Well I think Gostkowski has a claim?
The Patriots kicker?
Yes, the one - he has been consistent for so long.
He is good, but I think Hauschka is up there.
Yes, he is great too - on the Seahawks.
What do you think of Vinatieri?
I think he is arguably the greatest of all time.
What makes you say that?
He has so many big moments and has been consistently great.
If only the Colts could get back to dominance.
I think they will this year.
Are you an Andrew Luck fan?
Yes, I think he is amazing - just needs to stay healthy.
What do you think of Carson Palmer?
His best days are gone, but still solid.
He used to be great for the Bengals.
He's still put up decent numbers with the Cardinals.
I agree, but not as great.
He is getting somewhat old.
