Have you ever seen any zombie movies?
Yes, actually, though I kind of regret them.
Aww C'mon. Which ones where they?
The first one was World War Z, with Brad Pitt.
Oh isn't that the one where he has to try to save his family or something?
Yeah, they wanted to find a cure but he had to go through all these challenges to get it.
And they find out that the zombifier was a disease?
Yeah. That was it.
So how did the movie strike you?
It was a little terrifying at first - all these like bloodthirsty beings coming after you and the girl having an asthma attack.
And then?
And then I just kind of felt bad for the people that got sick! What a horrible way to die. I'd be devastated if my family went through that.
What was the other zombie movie?
It was the Maze Runner: the Scorch Trials.
That one is a zombie flick?
Well, it didn't start out that way but then I guess the story line was too boring so they got thrown in about halfway through.
You don't sound too impressed.
Well I'm not. They felt really tacked on and honestly laughable.
So not fear inspiring?
No, not at all! I just wanted those sequences to be over with already.
