Whats your take on the music in Star Wars?
I like a lot of it.
What's your favorite?
Darth Vader's theme.  Suits him.
A little heavy handed for sure.
And then I'm pretty sure there's a theme for Luke. Its a little dramatic but I like it.
I think I know the one you mean.
Then in the Force Awakens, I like Rey's theme.
I vividly remember that. Kind of striking and pretty.
It was intended to demonstrate some aspects of her personality.
