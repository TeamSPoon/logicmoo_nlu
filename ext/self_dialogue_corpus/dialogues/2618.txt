Patriots are team to beat until someone actually does beat them.
I can't believe the other 31 teams can't put something together to beat them when it matters.
Falcons were close in Super Bowl, but imploded in second half.
I and half the audience can't believe that happened!
That pretty much cements Tom Brady's place in Canton.
That is true, but he was already in before that game anyway.
You know what kind of sucks, is there are a lot of great players who have never won a ring.
That is true, but it seems that what people/voters get caught up in today are numbers.
I unfortunately agree.  Like receivers in today's game and probably in last 20 years are putting up outrageous numbers for stats because of the way the game has evolved.
It's hard to compare some of the greats of the 1960's & 1970's w/those of today because of those numbers.
I love the Raiders and think it's too bad Cliff Branch is not in the Hall.
You really think he is worthy.
Definitely, he was a home run threat, has career TD numbers that rival many of those that came after him, and many TV experts agree that he is Hall-worthy.
That probably is true, just wrong era in the game.
What about Cardinal great Jim Hart?
I don't know, he doesn't really have that 'wow' factor.
That's what I mean.  He played on very pedestrian teams in the same division as the Cowboys when they were perennial winners every year.
But did he ever do anything?
He was one of main reasons they were probably a competitive team some years.  He did this for over a decade in St. Louis with very few players that anyone who was not a die hard Cardinal fan can even name more than five of his teammates.  He was a pillar in that organization.
Obviously he was a little before my time.  I can respect his longetivity in an era when the NFL was much different than it is today.
