I hope they give Snoke a good backstory and motivation, Star Wars movies aren't always good at that.
What about Darth Vader? He's a villain with a good backstory.
Yeah, that's one, and you know what, I'll even throw in Emperor Palpatine, but that's it.
There's gotta be more than that? Tarkin?
He's just a guy who is Vader's superior and runs the Death Star according to the movies.
What about the expanded universe?
Then he's a guy who rose through the ranks of the Republic Military during the Clone Wars, and eventually became governor of the Outer Rim. Not particularly deep.
What about Count Dooku? He was a Jedi idealist who left the Order and went rogue to fight against the corruption in the Republic.
Yeah, and outside of that little tidbit of backstory he's basically just the evil leader of the Separatists. His buddy Grievous is no better.
Okay, I'll give you that. Star Wars is good at making cool villains, but they don't have a lot of depth.
