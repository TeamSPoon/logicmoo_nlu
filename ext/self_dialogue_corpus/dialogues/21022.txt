Hey! Did you see Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 yet?
I did! It was awesome!
I totally agree. I didn't think it could be better than the first, but it might actually be!
For sure! What were your favorite parts?
Wow, it is really hard to say for sure. I of course loved any scenes with Rocket Raccoon and Groot.
Oh yeah! They are the best! I couldn't get enough of Baby Groot!
I know I know! And wasn't Yondu great too?
He was! You know, I really wanted to dislike his character because of some of things he did in the last movie, but he completed redeemed himself in my opinion.
I totally agree; he ended up being a hero and one of my favorite characters!
I know! And that "I'm Mary Poppins y'all!" line was incredible!
You're right! It might have been the best line of the whole movie!
I know, I couldn't stop laughing. Where do you think the story might lead next?
I'm not sure; there are so many things they could do for Guardians 3...not to mention how this movie might fit into the overall Marvel Cinematic Universe.
For sure! I think for Guardians 3 they are definitely going to introduce Adam Warlock, especially after what we saw in Guardians 2!
I hope so! That would be great! I really liked how they also showed the original "Guardians of the Galaxy" in the post-credit scenes.
I know! It was a great bonus!
I might actually go see it again! I wonder if, on a second viewing, I might even catch something I missed?
I am with you; I would love to see it again! I bet there totally some Easter Eggs we didn't see the first time!
For sure! I can't wait to see it again now that I think about. You want to tag along?
Sure, sounds great! Let's go!
