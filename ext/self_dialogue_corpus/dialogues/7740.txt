Yesterday I sat down and watched Harry Potter and the sorcerer's stone.
Have you seen it before or was this your first time?
It was my first time, I know that I am a bit late to the party haha.
Took you long enough...  What did you think of it?
I really enjoyed it overall, I am interested in seeing how the characters develop going forward.
Are you planning on watching the next one soon?
I will definitely be watching Chamber of Secrets sometime this week.
That's great to hear, they are some of my favorite movies and I'm really glad to hear that you like them.  Who is your favorite character so far?
I think that my favorite character thus far is Hagrid. I really liked how he has been helping Harry ever since the beginning when he shows up for his birthday.   I also think that he is a pretty good comic relief.  He can really ease the tension in some of the situations and his collection of creatures is quite interesting as well.
Definitely a good choice for a favorite character for sure.  I think that you'll enjoy Chamber of Secrets!  You'll have to let me know what you think of it afterwards.
