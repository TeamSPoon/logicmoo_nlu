So my son's music class starts up on Monday.
Oh... wait isn't your son like 2?
Yeah, it's for children from 6 month to 5 years.
That's a bit long of an age gap.
Yeah, but the teacher is great about incorporating everyone.
So it's a group class.
Yeah.
Are they learning to play instruments or what?
Sort of, they play with a number of different instruments for different songs and there are other toys too.
So what do they learn.
Rhythm is a large part of it, along with listing to the songs and followin along with them.
So it's a play group?
Sort of, but a directed play group.
What do you mean.?
They change instruments every song (or two), play along with the song as best they can, and help put things back.
Has your son gotten anything out of it.
Quite a bit actually.
Like what?
He wasn't talking or understanding directions, and now he sings, talks, and can follow simple directions.
Well that's good.
