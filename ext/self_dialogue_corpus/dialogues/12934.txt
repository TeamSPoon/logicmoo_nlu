Did you enjoy the new star wars at all?
The force awakens?
Yeah.
Not really actually.
Seriously?
Yeah I think it was much over hyped. I liked seeing harrison ford and carrie fisher but not the new people.
Yeah I get that. When you are so used to the old characters, new ones seem weird.
Plus it was by Disney this time. I did not like it.
Well it was nice speaking to you.
You too!
