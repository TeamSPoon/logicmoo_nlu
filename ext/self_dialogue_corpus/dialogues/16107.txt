Were you ever a fan of Michael Jackson at all?
Oh I definitely was! I loved loved his music so much.
It's really sad that he passed away a few years ago.
I know! This world lost a legend when he died.
Yes it did. I would love to see him in concert.
I did when I was younger. With my cousins.
Oh wow how was it?
It was electric, amazing!
I bet it was. I would have killed to be there.
Which of his songs did you like the best?
That's a really tough question, let me think.
I know one of my faves was "Thriller". I loved the music video.
I loved that one too! I would have to say my favorite though was "Man in the Mirror."
Oh yes that one was beautiful.
I still listen to all his songs to this day.
I do too! You can't beat his music.
No you really can't. There are no artists that can compare in this day and age.
I completely agree with you there.
Remember his song "Smooth Criminal"?
Remember it? I created a dance to that song.
