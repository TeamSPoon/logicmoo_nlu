I have a friend whose boyfriend is in a heavy metal band.
That's interesting! Do you like heavy metal?
Personally, it's a little too intense for me.
Too much screaming, not enough singing, huh?
I wouldn't say that necessarily. It's just not my style.
Fair enough. So what kinds of music do you like?
I have a seriously weak spot for Broadway.
Oh, are you a fan of Phantom of the Opera?
Some of the songs, yes. But I really love some of the more recent musicals.
Like what?
Next to Normal is probably my favorite. It's basically a rock musical.
Sounds interesting!
I also have a big weakness for J-Pop.
Really? What are some of your favorite songs?
I love Closer by Joe Inoue.
Isn't that the same guy who wrote one of the Naruto theme songs?
Yup!
Do you like listening to anime theme songs particularly?
Sometimes. You have to admit, the Pokemon theme song is super catchy.
It really is.
