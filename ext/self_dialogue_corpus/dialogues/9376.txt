I really can't stand violent rap lyrics.
I agree. Some of the older, fun rap is OK but the violent stuff is unsettling.
It's sickening that people view that as entertainment.
I agree. Some of the things said about women turn my stomach.
I never let my daughters listen to it.
My son tries to but I hate it.
I wouldn't let him.
I don't but he is getting older and does what he wants. I do tell him the things said about women upset me.
What does he say?
He says he doesn't agree with that violent stuff but then I wonder why he listens.
