I saw Woman in Black yesterday.
Wasn't that the creepy movie that came out a few years ago?
Right.  Had Daniel Radcliffe in it.
Oh yeah.  His wife died and he went to some old estate I think.
My wife jumped so many times in that movie.
You kept seeing the woman in the background in the shadows.
Right, it was very unsettling.
The ending is a bummer to as he died.
His kid too, both hit by a train.  He was reunited with his family which is kind of an odd happy ending.
I believe they made a sequel too, but haven't seen it.
