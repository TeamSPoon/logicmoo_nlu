Have you seen any of the Toy Story movies?
I have seen them all. The third one was my favorite.
I liked the third one the best, too.
The baby doll with the half open eye creeped me out.
Same here, but I liked that he turned on Lottso at the end.
Did you think the fire scene at the dump was too scary for kids?
A little bit. But I liked how the toys all held hands and came together as one.
Bonnie was by far my favorite character. She is so cute!
I agree! So glad Andy picked her to keep all of his toys.
Me too. It was a beautiful ending.
