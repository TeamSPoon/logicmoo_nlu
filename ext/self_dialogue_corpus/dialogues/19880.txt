What do you think of EDM music?
What is that?
It's called Electronic Dance Music. It's played in raves and clubs.
Oh, yeah. I think I've heard or that. It is like techno?
It is like a really advanced version of techno. Lots of varying beats and patterns.
Sounds cool. I might have heard some of this music.
Do you know who Deadmau5 is?
Yeah, I've heard of him. Is he the one who wears the mouse hat?
Yes, That's him. Do you remember hearing any of his tracks?
I think I do. It's called, "I remember."
Yes, that's right! It's a good one too.
I think I might like this genre.
There's also a sub-genre of EDM known as Dubstep.
What is that?
Dubstep is a type of EDM with very strange, goofy beats.
Sounds like I might like it.
You should check out Illenium & Said the Sky. They make good dubstep.
Sure will!
