Do you think we will ever get any more Harry Potter movies?
I don't think Rowling wants to write any more.
She said that and then she wrote the screenplay and that movie about fantastic beasts.
True, but those weren't in the same line, really.
I could see them going ahead and doing more about the fallout of Voldemort's reign.
Someone evil has to take his place.
So then Harry's kids take up the fight?
Yes, or maybe his grandchildren.
It would be kind of a rip-off, though.
They do it with all franchises eventually.
