Will the Browns ever be good?
Maybe
They were so bad last year
Don't forget the year before
They need better draft picks
I like their pick this year
It was better than their other picks
Why are they so bad?
They have bad management
That must be the reason
I think they will get better though
Me too
They can't be bad forever
True
I feel bad for the Cleveland fans
Well, that city has other good teams
I think they can get better in two years
On the bright side, they had one home win last year
That is true
At least they did not go 0 and 16
