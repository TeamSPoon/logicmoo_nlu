Did you ever see The Departed?
Yes, that movie is insane.
That's probably one of the best action movies I have ever seen.
Yeah, the plot is awesome and so is the action.
I think I liked it so much because it seemed so real.
I agree. I feel like that sort of thing actually goes on in real life.
The cast was so good, too.
Yeah there were quite a few A-list celebrities in that one.
The characters all had their own agenda and they were ruthless.
Yes, they were. By the end of the movie my jaw was on the floor in awe.
