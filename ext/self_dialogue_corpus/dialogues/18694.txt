What do you think of Slime Girls?
What's that?
It's a band. They make 8-bit chiptune music.
Kind of like in those old Gameboy games?
Exactly. They use the same types of sounds and make really cool songs.
That sounds interesting.
It is the best music to listen to when playing video games.
That kind of music definitely seems to go hand-in-hand with video games.
Doesn't it? Before I knew about Slime Girls, I didn't listen to music when playing games.
Why's that?
I think the lyrics can be distracting when playing an attention-intensive game.
If you like 8-bit music, have you heard of groundislava?
No, but I bet I would like them.
It's just one guy who makes all the music. He's local to Los Angeles.
I'll make sure to download an album or two.
His self-titled album is my favorite one.
When you listen to Slime Girls, you should make sure to listen to Vacation Wasteland.
I like the album artwork.
Me too. It's very cute.
Very much like the music, it seems!
