Ice hockey players are exceptional athletes, it's like they're playing football while wearing ice skates.
Can you explain the basics of hockey to me?
Well in hockey they divide the rink into three zones.
Like how in football the field is divided in half by the 50 yard line?
Yes, sort of like that. The objective is to hit the puck into the net.
I've seen them do that.
The area where the goal net is in is called the defending zone.
Are both the goal nets in defending zones?
No, the goal net for the team that has the puck is called the offensive zone.
I think I understand. The name of the zone depends on which team is in possession of the puck at that point in time.
Yes. And there's a section in the middle of the rink that is called the neutral zone.
Is that the area between the blue lines?
Yes. The game begins or resumes whenever the players fight for possession of the puck in the neutral zone.
Is that called the face off?
Exactly. Each team has six players. One of them is the goalkeeper, who guards that team's goal.
Do the other players have positions, like in football?
Yes, there are three forwards and two defensemen.
And the teams can take players out and put others in, just like in football.
It's sort of like that.
But they can never have more than 6 players at a time.
