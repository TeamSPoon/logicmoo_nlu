I finally saw the movie La La Land.
About time. What did you think?
Do you mean what did I think of the plot, the music or the whole thing?
Well tell me what you liked or didn't like about the movie.
It wasn't what I expected after all the hype
Like how?
I thought it was going to be like a modern take on an old fashioned movie musical.
There was a lot of music. I liked a couple of the songs a lot.
I didn't HATE La La Land. It's fun. It's cute but I don't think it compares to a good movie musical.
Why not?
In a good movie musical, you can take away all the songs and dances and it will still be a great story with great dialogue and performances.
I see what your saying. Like Grease, Chicago, West Side Story-the classics.
Exactly, Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone were very good, but I wanted more.
More what?
More development in the characters, better dancing....I kept waiting for the next dance scene, more connection between the main characters.
Well, did you like the music?
I did actually, especially the song Audition and City of Stars
What did you think of the La La Land theme music. I thought that was cool.
Oh, I do like that too and I really liked how it looked-the cinematography? Gorgeous.
I know what you mean-  it was dream like sort of like dreamy vintage postcards of LA
