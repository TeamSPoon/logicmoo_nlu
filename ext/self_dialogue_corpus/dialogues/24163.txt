What is your favorite genre of film?
I don't know that I have a true favorite. I like films on their merit.
Well what films do you think are great?
I thought the fountain was very well done.
Is hugh jackman in that one?
Yes and Rachel Weisz is his wife.
Yes, I somewhat recall it now. Sad movie.
It's subject matter is heart wrenching. but so beautifully shot.
Aronofsky was key in that he chose to do the visual effects for the film by using micro-photography of chemicals instead of CGI.
Wow, that is interesting to learn.
He is such an impressive director, writer filmmaker to me.
He has some great films.
I also love Black Swan.
That is a great role for Natalie Portman.
Yes, she really pulled it out for the movie.
I like Aronofsky but always darker material.
I think that is just his taste and aesthetic.
I love it, I just meant I can't see loving if he did a comedy, not truly him.
I would like to see him maybe do a dark comedy.
That may be doable and remain true to his style and taste.
