I saw the final Harry Potter flick.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows â€“ Part, 2!
Yes, with David Yates as director, once again.
Doesn't Harry "die" in this one?
Yes, he goes into limbo for awhile and sees Dumbledore.
Cool.  What happens in the end?
Harry finally kills Voldemort1
Yay!
Harry gets Ginny and Rupert gets Hermione.
Totally not right!
