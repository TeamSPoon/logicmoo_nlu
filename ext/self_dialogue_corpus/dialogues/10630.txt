Were you into cars before watching Fast and the Furious or after?
I saw the first one was I was little, so definitely after.
What about the movies made you get into cars?
The cars were so cool, and Paul Walker was cool.
Did you like any specific cars from the movies?
I was always a fan of the cars that Paul Walker drove.
He always had foreign cars and modified cars like Mitsubishis and such.
Yeah and they were more colorful as opposed to Vin Diesel's cars.
So did you Tokyo Drift then?
Yes, that one is my favorite. I have been a big drifting fan since and love the cars in that movie.
