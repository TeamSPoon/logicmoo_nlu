hi sam
sup clarke what's good?
everything cool with me
alright great, so sup?
its Anna's birthday tomorrow and i have been thinking of what i could surprise her with, so don't know if you can help me come with something.
do have any idea in mind yourself or you just want to first seek mine?
hmm not really, i can't really pin one down,so had to ask you hahaha
alright , so what kind of music does anna likes?
she loves electric music and dj's party sound track, she dance to those most times at home.
okay,i'll be right back let me confirm something
alright
okay mate, coincidentally avincii  would be playing live at london town square tomorrow night, so if she loves electric music which avincii does then she might appreciate a surprised concert ticket
wow why didn't i think about this all this while,she was actually talking to het friend about it ,but was like she can't go because she is saving for her new car
so you see i'm a genius hahaha
oyeah you're a star hahaha, so how much is the ticket you reckon?
its 20GBP for one person and 30GBP for couple
i should be able to afford that, although i don't like electric music as anna but this won't kill me for one night.
hahaha who knows, you might be converted after the show,avincii is great.
you have high hopes man, pray on,
oyeah.....well let me know how it all went down though.
