Jonny, have you figured out the end of that riff yet?
No, Butch.  I haven't.  Give me some time.  It's  getting there.
Well, you're holding us all up ya' know.  We can't get this song cut till we got that right.
I know.  I'm working on it.  Nothing seems to click right with it.  I can't get the sound right.
Should we start playing the song from the beginning again.  Perhaps that will inspire you a bit.
No, I know how that song goes.  I just can't get those last three cords right.  I'll get it down.
Hope so, it's costing us money just sitting here waiting to lay down this track.
Well, you pushing me doesn't help.  Why don't you re-lay the vocals on the chorus while I'm getting this down.  That's save some time.
Alright, but you'll have to go out into the hall to practice then and you will either be unplugged or have to drag an amp out there.
Great.  I have to be plugged in.  It's the bending of the E string that I'm having the issue with.  You know, you heard it.
Yeah, I know.  Well if I played guitar I'd show you how to do it.
Just stick to vocals Butch, it's what you do best.  Maybe grab your tambourine if you want something to do with your hands.
All right.  No need to get testy.  I'll get Lisa and we'll go over the chorus and leave you to practicing.
Thanks, I'll get it soon.  Then we can give a couple runs through before we end for the night.
Ok.  do you got the rest of the song down?
Sure do.  And I've learned Drive Alive from the live version of Freedom's new album.
Really, great.  That's a good version too.  Alex goes way out there on the vocals on that one.
I know.  I was thinking about you when I decided to learn it.  It's a killer song.
Oh, yeah.  I can't wait to let Lisa know.  She can do a solo in that one.
All right.  I'm going out in the hall then to practice.  Help me plugging in an amp will ya.
