How are the Nats doing this season?
Pretty well! Leading their division.
Think they'll make the postseason?
Pretty confident.
Who else could knock them out?
The NL East isn't looking great this year, I think they'll win the division pretty easily.
Yeah, I saw the Mets aren't doing nearly as well as last year.
No, not at all.
Bryce Harper's contract is ending soon, right?
Yes, it was supposed to end after this season, but they managed to sign him to one more year.
Oh, how much?
21.6 million. Quite a contract.
That is a ton of money.
Yeah, I hope he's worth it. Nats need to win a pennant while they have him, Scherzer, and Strasburg.
Yeah, they've got quite a bit of talent, it'd be a shame not to capitalize now.
The team is in great shape, I think they can compete. The Cubs look good too though.
Yeah, making the postseason is just the first step. Think they can make it to the World Series?
Well, I was worried about the Cubs after last season, but they seem to be underperforming so far.
Yeah, maybe they'll make it.
I hope so!
