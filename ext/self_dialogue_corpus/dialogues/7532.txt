I just realized something in Harry Potter.
What was that?
That Neville Long-bottom, could have been Harry, I mean could kill Voldemort just as easily.
How do you figure that?
Well, his parents were his enemies, Voldemort I mean.
So was most of the magical community.
Yes, but he was also saved out of love. Just like the prophecy said would be needed.
But his parents are alive.
They are not really, they are more or less comatose.  He was able to kill Voldemort just as easily as Harry.
Wow, I just realized you are right.
