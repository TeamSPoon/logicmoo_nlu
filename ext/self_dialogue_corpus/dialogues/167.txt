What do you think about Deadpool?
He is so funny. Ryan Reynolds is perfect for that character.
Yeah, I think so too. The first was really funny. Looking forward to the next.
There's one on the way?
Yeah, I just saw it somewhere. But don't get too excited, it's not coming out until 2018 February.
Well we are half way there.
Yeah, the trailer looks pretty good.
I will. I can't wait. A teaser will go a long way.
Yeah, I'm looking forward to it. It looks pretty good.
Yeah, Deadpool is the best. I think he's my favorite superhero.
