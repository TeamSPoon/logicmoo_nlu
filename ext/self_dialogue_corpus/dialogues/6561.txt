That new Disney movie Moana turned out to be pretty good, eh?
The Rock has a good voice. I've never heard of him doing a cartoon before!
It was probably something pretty new to him, but yeah I agree.
They were loyal to the Polynesian culture. Pretty cool to see.
Hawaii hasn't had a Disney film since Lilo and Stitch. It was very respectful.
The songs were very good and rehearsed well.
Yeah, my kids can't stop singing a few of them.
A lot of good jokes in there so it's not too boring for adults to watch.
I agree, I found myself laughing more than I thought I would.
I liked how there wasn't a love story involved at all. Completely new for Disney.
