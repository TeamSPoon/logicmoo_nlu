Spider-Man: Homecoming is coming out soon. It looks good.
It looks more like Iron Man: Featuring Spider-Man if you ask me.
They do want to really push the fact that Spider-Man is in the Marvel Cinematic Universe now.
Yet he still belongs to Sony, right?
Yes, but they have a deal so they can share the character.
I heard that Sony is making a Venom spin-off film, and it will be canon to Homecoming, but it won't be canon to the rest of the MCU films?
They have wanted to make a Venom movie for a long time. I don't know how that'll work though.
I think it'll be like, things that happen in Homecoming effect Venom, but things that happen in Venom just won't impact Thor or whatever.
This is what happens when a company sells off their IPs then tries to get them back. We get messes like this.
They have the same issue with Fox and The Fantastic Four and X-Men. Except they can't use those characters at all.
I don't know about that, I think they made some sort of deal with them to get that X-Men TV show Legion made.
So Marvel can use the X-Men now?
I don't think it's anything like that, but they have some sort of smaller deal.
That might be for the best. The X-Men movies have been going for 17 years now, so it would be hard to cram them into the Marvel universe.
Wow, it's crazy to think it's been that long since the first one.
And even crazier to think that the series is more popular than ever thanks to movies like Logan and Deadpool.
You gotta hand it to Fox, I guess. They may not know what to do with The Fantastic Four, but they're doing something right with X-Men.
Definitely, but I'm a bit sad we'll never get to see Hugh Jackman interacting with Robert Downey Jr. or any other Avenger.
At least we got Logan though. That was the perfect sendoff for him and Patrick Stewart.
Yeah, it really was.
