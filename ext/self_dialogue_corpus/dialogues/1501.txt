I am excited about the new NFL season how about you?
Yes me too I always like to watch the games.
Me too that is like what me and wife do on Sundays is watch the games together!
Who is your favorite team?
I am a homer love the Arizona Cardinals.
Do you think they will do well this year?
Yes they should given the talent level on the team.
Last year was  disappointing for them.
Yes especially given the precious year they went to the NFC championship game and lost to the Panthers.
They need new players Palmer and Fitzgerald are getting old don't you think?
Maybe a little but they are still one of the best Quarterback and receiver duos in the NFL.
Plus Fitzgerald is just an all around great guy donating to charity his money and time to kids in the community.
Yes that is true too but they also have some new recruits with great potential.
Like who?
Haason Reddick to name one. Drafted 13th over all in the 2017 draft.
What position does he play?
Linebacker and he is a good one and that is where Arizona needed some improvement is on defense.
Where did he play college football?
Temple where he had an outstanding record.
I agree then he should be a good addition to the team and help them back in form to win the NFC Championship and hopefully all the way to the Super Bowl!
