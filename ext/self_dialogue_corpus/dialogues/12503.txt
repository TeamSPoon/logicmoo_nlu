What did you think about Rogue One?
It was absolutely terrible.
Are you serious? I thought it was great.
Ugh, the plot line was so slow, I couldn't stand it.
Yea, but there were many plot holes filled from previous movies.
How so?
They explained why the Death Star had the one gleaming imperfection which caused it to explode.
That's true, but the movie itself was only good for the last 20 minutes or so.
I guess if you;re only in it for the action.
When there are Jedi's and the Force, of course I'm in it for the action!
