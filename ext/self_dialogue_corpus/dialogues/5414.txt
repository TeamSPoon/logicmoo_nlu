What is your third favorite Disney movie?
I like Dumbo the little elephant.
Why do you like sad ones?  Dumbo was one of the saddest that made me cry.
Dumbo was sad but it was nice that he made friends with the other circus animals.
What happened to Dumbo's mother?
His mother was locked up in a cage for awhile.
Dumbo had big ears and could fly correct?
Yes, that was part of his act.
Did Dumbo escape from the circus?
He did escape at the end.  I think he flew away.
