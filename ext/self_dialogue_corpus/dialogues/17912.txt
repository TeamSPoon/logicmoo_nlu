Who do you think is the King of Pop? Michael Jackson or Justin Timberlake?
Michael Jackson all the way! Justin even idolizes him.
Really? I didn't know that!
Yea, he has similar singing styles like in 'Cry Me a River.'
I think I can see that.  I would have to agree.
Do you think Michael Jackson is the King of Pop?
Totally, no one can beat him.
What's your favorite album by Michael?
I think it would have to be 'Thriller!'
Me too! That album was like the best one he did.
Yes! 'Beat It' will have to be my favorite.
Oh that song makes me dance all the time.
And that music video for 'Thriller?' So good.
We didn't even talk about his dance moves in that video!
It's so legendary, we still dance it today.
I know, at every party!
'Billie Jean' will have to be next on my book.
You know I was like 9 years old when that song came out.
Ah don't remind me! I'm older than you.
It will always be a hit in my heart.
