What's your favorite one-hit wonder song?
Easy: Come On Eileen.
Why that one?
Well, it's fun, and you have no idea what the lyrics are.
That's true - even with lyrics in the background I can't understand them at all.
I also like playing them.
You've performed their music?
My pep band in undergrad had that as our repertoire.
Was the tuba part boring? I know you played tuba.
I did! But no, it wasn't boring at all. It's actually a fast-moving part that's pretty fun.
Have you listened to their other songs?
If I did, that would defeat the one-hit-wonder status, wouldn't it?
No, that applies to radio play.
I know, I'm kidding. I own their first CD.
How is it?
Completely unremarkable.
Why don't you like it?
It's not that I don't like it. It's just that there's a reason they're one-hit-wonders.
Why would that be?
All their music sounds the same. Nothing about it distinguishes it from anything else they've produced.
