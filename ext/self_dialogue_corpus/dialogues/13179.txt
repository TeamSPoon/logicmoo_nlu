I thought Starkiller Base in The Force Awakens was awesome!
Yeah, it was like a massive Death Star.
I wonder what the red dirt speeders in The Last Jedi trailer were?
I don't know - but it might be another cool Hoth battle except in the desert.
I wonder what they will do with Carrie Fisher in Episode IX?
Perhaps they will give her an honorable death at the beginning of the movie.
Did you enjoy Rogue One?
I thought it was wonderful, especially with the ending with Darth Vader.
Yes, that was the Darth Vader scene that we've always wanted.
I thought the Leia and Tarkin effects in Rogue One were awesome.
