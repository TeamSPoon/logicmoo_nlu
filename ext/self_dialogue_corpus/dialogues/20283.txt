Did you know Baby Driver comes out this week?
I heard that.  Are you going to see it?
I want to.  It's gotten pretty good reviews.
It has?  I haven't seen any reviews yet.
My son said it got a 94% on Rotten Tomatoes.
Wow?  That's pretty high.
Plus, there are some pretty good actors in it.
I saw that Jamie Foxx was in it.
Yes, and Jon Berenthal.
Is he the guy from The Punisher?  The Netflix one.
Yes.  He was also Shane on The Walking Dead.
He always seems to play the bad guy.
He is one of my favorite actors.
I guess I will go see that movie.  The name sounds dumb though.
I know.  I guess the main character's name is Baby.
That makes sense.
What other movies are you looking forward to?
I'm excited about the new Spiderman movie.  It comes out July 7th.
That one does look pretty good.
We should go see it on opening night at the IMAX.
