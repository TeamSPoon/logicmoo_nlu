What was the best Star Wars movie.
I'd say either Empire Strikes back or Rogue One.
Yeah definitely both awesome.
I'm going to go with Empire.
As you should.  It was awesome and had the reveal about Vader being Luke's father.
Plus is is part of the main story.  Rogue One was great but more of an interest piece.
And in Empire they showed that the bad guys can win.
At least for a while.  Everything was bad for the Rebellion after Empire.
But they turned it around in the next movie.
Yeah, only because Luke finished his training.
