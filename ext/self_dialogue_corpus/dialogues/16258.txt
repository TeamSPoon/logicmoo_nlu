I don't know anything about classical music, but I started dating a girl who's really into it.
Are you going to try to learn something about it.
I think I have to. I lied and said I was a big fan.
You didn't. That's a huge mistake!
I didn't know what else to do. It happened before I could say anything.
So what do you know about classical music.
Um. I know a couple by Beethoven.
That's a start. What do you know?
Ode to Joy? And the one that goes bum-bum-bum-bum-bum.
That's his fifth. But that's really not much to go on!
I know. This is a disaster.
Okay. What kind of music do you like?
I like pop music. Basically anything that comes on the radio.
I don't think that will impress a girl who's into classical music.
Well, what do you think I should do?
Maybe just come clean?
I feel like that's a bad idea.
No, I think being honest is correct.
I really can't just study?
I think it would take a lifetime to learn enough about classical music!
