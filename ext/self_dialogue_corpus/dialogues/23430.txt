I watched a good movie last night.
What did you watch?
It's called Lawless.
About what?
It's about outlaws during Prohibition.
What happens?
The government is corrupt and wants to control the money flow.
Sounds like today.
I know.
The corruption is horrible.
The brothers stand up to them and win.
How do they do that.
It ends up in a big gun fight.
Do they all live?
Yes. It is thought they are immortal.
Are they really.
No.  it's just a legend.
Who is in it?
One is Shia Labeouf.
He is a great actor.
