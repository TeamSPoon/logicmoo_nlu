Do you have a favorite Disney Princess?
When I was little I liked Mulan and I know Lilo doesn't count but she should.
I think Lilo's sister Nani is a great character. Watching that movie as an adult and hearing it Nani's situation makes my heart reach out.
Do you have a favorite princess?
I always like the music of Pochahontas but I never really picked a favorite girl.
Was there a princess in Atlantis?
Yeah! I think her name was Kida.
I always liked her hair.
Atlantis was a great movie. I should find the sequel.
Let's watch it together.
