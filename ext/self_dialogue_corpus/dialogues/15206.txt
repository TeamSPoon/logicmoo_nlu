So did you watch the Grateful Dead doc on prime.
I did. I love their music, man.
What's your favorite song.
Man, it's not about just the song. It's the performance too.
Not for me. I love American Beauty.
Good album. But Friend of the Devil at Chicago on April 9, 1985 is the best.
Friend of the Devil is good. I like Candyman.
Man, Candyman is awesome.
"Mr Benson, I see you're doing well"
"I went down to Memphis where I learned to talk a jive."
Robert Hunter is a great lyricist.
He was like the fifth Beatle of the Dead.
He was definitely enlightened.
Yeah, but he needed Jerry, man to make the music and sing the lyrics.
Jerry's voice was something else.
A wise angel.
Weir aint bad either.
He's all we got now and that's pretty good.
Have you seen Dead and Company.
Man,let me tell you about April 11, 2015 in St. Louis...
