Do you know who the best-selling pop music artist of all time is?
Do you mean group or individual?
I would like to know both!
The best-selling group is the Beatles. The best-selling artist is Elvis Prestley.
What about Michael Jackson?
He comes in right after Elvis.
I understand. Do you think that order will ever change?
I think so.
Why do you think it will change?
There is better distribution today. So, a great artist like Katy Perry can more easily sell her music.
