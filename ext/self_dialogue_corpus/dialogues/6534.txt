I think a new Wreck-it Ralph is coming out soon?
I heard.
I wonder when though because I have been hearing this-
Since last year! I know!
I don't know how much longer I can wait.
I think it is either coming out later this year or at the beginning of next.
Cool, I can't wait to see Vanellope again.
I know, any idea what it's about.
No details yet from what I here.
I think it will be awesome nonetheless.
