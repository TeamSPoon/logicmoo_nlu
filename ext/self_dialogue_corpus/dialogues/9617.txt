Hey do you like the Notorious B.I.G.?
Well yeah, I love him!  He was one of my favorite rap artists in the nineties.
Yeah, it's too bad he was shot.
I know!  I bet he would've kept making good music.
No doubt.  He and Dre were awesome back in the day.
Yeah they really were.  I think he's still alive, though.
That's possible.  His album Ready To Die was amazing.
Yeah, you could play the whole thing without skipping any songs.
Yeah, they were all great.
Yeah, they were.  I wonder what his songs would've been like if he'd kept making them.
