I'm excited about the Los Angeles Lakers' future.
Me too. I love the direction that the organization is going.
I mean bringing in Magic Johnson will definitely help this team
I concur. He is just what this organization needs going forward.
They have some tough decisions to make on this roster though
Yeah they do, I mean Metta World Peace is gone
They will probably get rid of Tarik Black and put D'Angelo Russell on the trading block
You think they will trade Russell? Why?
I think they are going to draft Lonzo Ball and he will be their point guard of the future
Yeah I can see that, but it seems too early to give up on Russell
Unless they decide that he can be their full-time shooting guard
I don't know if I see that out of him.
Yeah me too, but he has to either play the one or two
Right, but he doesn't seem entirely comfortable in either position.
So maybe they start the beginning of year with Ball at the point and Russell at the 2
See if they can play together well before they make any decisions.
Exactly. Both players are pretty good size, so you could play both at the same time.
They are both pretty weak defensively but they have time to get better
I think it's an experiment worth trying.
I do too. It's going to be an exciting year for the Lakers
