Were you ever a big fan of Queen?
I never was growing up, but I like them now.
You never listened to them growing up?
I really never reallized how good their music was.
It really is though.  What is your favorite song?
Obviously, everyone loves Bohemian Rhapsody.  I'm not sure about the others.
Yeah, everyone knows Bohemian Rhapsody.
Somebody to Love is okay too.
Yeah, I like Fat Bottom Girls, too.
That song is crazy.
Yeah, the lyrics are funny, but the music rocks too.
Freddie Mercury had an awesome voice.
He actually seemed like he would have been a character.
I heard that he actually was a shy guy.
Yeah, I've read somewhere that he really didn't like to do interviews.
And to be so wild on stage!
He was truly a loss to the music world.
Yeah, but doesn't Queen still tour.
I think they've done tours recently.
They must just switch out lead singers.
