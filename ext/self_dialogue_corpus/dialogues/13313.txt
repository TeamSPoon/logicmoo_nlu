So did you see the preview for The Last Jedi?
Yes, that was awesome.  It's going to be a great movie.
Do you think they'll tell us who Rey's parents are?
I do, but my theory is a little bit different.  I think she gets her Jedi blood from the Kenobi blood line.
That would be amazing!  And a surprise.  What about Snoke?
I would love to see who he is.  Maybe he's someone we already know.
I heard a theory that it could be Mace Windu.
That would be great, he exited way too easy.
For the heck of it bring back Darth Maul too.
I'm not sure about that.  He was cool but lets not be too far fetched.
