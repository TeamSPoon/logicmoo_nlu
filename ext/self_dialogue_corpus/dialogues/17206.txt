Hey quick question.
Sure shoot.
If you could learn to play any instrument what would it be?
I'd want to learn to play the guitar the most I think.
What makes you want to play that?
Well I think having a piano is a bit much. I can't carry it around and they can be expensive.
Oh yeah?
Yeah, with a guitar I can bring it around, play songs, and maybe even get a couple of tips while doing it.
Ha. You mean like begging for change?
Musicians don't beg for change man. They just are practicing playing for large crowds.
Never thought of it that way actually.
Yeah, it's a good way to get over a far of playing infront of people.
I'm sure some do it for money though.
Oh of course, but I'm sure they all start off trying to get over a fear of playing in front of people.
Yeah I suppose.
What about you? What instrument would you want to learn?
I'd go for the piano.
Why, it's way too much work.
Yes, when you brought up your reasons those did stand out but I still like the instrument enough to deal with that downsides.
You're a better man than me.
