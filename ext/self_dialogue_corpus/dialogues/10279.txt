So, what makes an action movie an action movie?
For one thing, it needs a chase scene. A  car chase, preferably with cars turned over and stunt men laying down motorcycles.
Yeah, like in Bullit. That was so cool. You could see McQueen actually driving that thing, all through it.
Bullit didn't invent the chase, but it perfected it.
No doubt. Then there's the chase in The French Connection. That was a new action movie high, too.
Yeah, I remember. All along under the tracks. Gene Hackman was so great.
Yeah, and there's a car crash in it, you remember?
Yeah, of course I do. Blam, crumples him.
Well, that was real. Some guy was on his way to work, and didn't know they were filming. They paid him, and fixed his car.
No kidding. No wonder it looked real.
