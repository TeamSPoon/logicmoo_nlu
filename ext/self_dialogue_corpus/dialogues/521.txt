Do you plan on watching the upcoming NFL season?
Definitely. I am really sad that the Oakland Raiders are moving.
The San Francisco 49ers moved to Santa Clara. The Bay Area is losing its second team.
So true. What a shame it is! I think the Broncos and Patriots will make it to next year's super bowl.
Hmm. I could definitely see that. The 2016 super bowl with the Broncos and Panthers was a very good watch. I thought the Panthers would win.
I was shocked, as well. I love watching football though it's such a good sport. Very technical!
Definitely, I have to agree with you. I hate when refs favor a team though. They need more honest referees.
Who is your all time favorite NFL player?
Definitely Joe Montana. He was the best football player of all team, even though Tom Brady beat some of his records.
Really? I didn't know that. So Tom Brady is the best player in the NFL right now?
I would say so! Based on his age and stats he still has a few good years before retirement and has many super bowl rings already.
Did you know that Tom Brady is married to Gisele Bundchen?
The model? No I didnt! What a small world. Do you have a favorite football player?
I do, Marshawn Lynch.
Why is he your favorite player?
Because he is fast, funny and righteous. He is a good loser and an even better winner because he is a good person.
