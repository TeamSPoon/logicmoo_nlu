I really love the batman movies
They are pretty rad
I mean most of them have some the best performances
I do not know i like spiderman
Well they are both good
Yeah that is true
But the actors in spiderman are not as refined
Are you kidding me
No i am serious
How are they not as refined
Well does anyone pull a heath ledger
What?
Someone pulling the role close to the comics
I think he was far from the comics in the dark knight
How though
Well he lacked the same depth
Nah their was plenty of depth
Really?
Yes really?
Pfft
