How many animated Disney movies are there?
Well, it depends on how you classify them. All animated movies, only classics, Pixar included? That's not an easy question!
Okay, I will narrow it down. Animated Disney classics.
I think there are around 30.
It seems like there are more.
Well, for example, I don't think Princess and the Frog is considered a Disney classic.
Who even decides that?
I have no idea!
Was Snow White the first though.
Yes it was.
