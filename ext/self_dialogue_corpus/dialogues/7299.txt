Did you ever see Findiny Dory?
No not yet, I heard it's really good though.
Yea I thought so. Probably not as good as Finding Nemo, but still good.
Well Finding Nemo was an instant classic, so it would be pretty hard to top the original.
That's true.
Is there going to be another sequel after Finding Dory?
I can't tell you, that's spoil the end of Finding Dory for you if you ever decided to see it.
Ok, ok, fair enough.
Definitely give it a watch though. You can never go wrong with Ellen Degeneres voicing a fish.
Haha, yea I'll make sure I watch it soon.
