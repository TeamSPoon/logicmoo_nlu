So what do you think about the Little Mermaid movie?
Oh  I love it and Ariel is one of my favorite princesses.
Oh really, why?
I love how she sings and her red bright hair.
What else do you like about her movie?
I like that she has a lot of sisters and her desire to become human.
Do you think she should had trusted Ursula?
Not a bit! If she was more open with her dad she could have avoided lots of danger.
But at the end she got her happy ending, right?
Yes! Just that her dad is going to miss her very much.
