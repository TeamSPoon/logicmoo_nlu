Have you heard Lady Gaga's new song?
I'm not sure. What is it called?
I think it's called A Million Reasons, but I'm not sure.
That sounds familiar, I think I've heard it.
I felt like it was a totally new sound for her. How about you?
She reinvents herself all the time, so not really.
I like it. I wonder if she is putting out a new album soon.
If she has a new song on the radio than probably. Are you going to buy it?
I will probably stream it on Spotify if it's on  there.
Sounds like a good idea.
