Do you like Lady Gaga?
I love her!  She's one of my favorites!
What's your favorite Gaga song?
I love them all, obviously.  But I really like Poker Face.
I like Alejandro.
Oh, that's a good one too.  I forgot about that one.
She has a lot of good stuff, it's amazing that she's so talented.
I know.  I really can't stand people like Katy Perry who try to copy her.
Katy Perry is the dirt worst.
She can't sing at all.  Gaga runs circles around her talent wise.
