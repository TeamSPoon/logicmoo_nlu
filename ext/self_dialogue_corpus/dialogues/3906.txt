Taxi Driver was a great movie
Is that with Robert DeNiro?
Yes. Martin Scorses directed it.
When was it made?
In the 70's
Cool. Was it scary?
No. It was more of a psychological suspense flick
Excellent. I have never seen one like that
There are not many.
I like movies with a lot of violence and suspense.
