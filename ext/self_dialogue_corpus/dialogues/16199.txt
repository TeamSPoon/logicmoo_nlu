Are you a fan of K-pop
K-pop? What is that?
Korean pop music. It's quite popular these days.
I'll have to check it out. What bands are worth listening to?
I personally like BTS. It's got more of a hip hop feel to their music.
I'm not a fan a hip hop though. Whats good for people who like bubblegum pop?
I would suggest you listen to Girls Day
Is that a singer?
It's a group of 5 girls in the same band.
Do they play instruments?
No, they don't play instruments, but they do dance.
What song do you recommend by girls day then?
I recommend you listen to 'Something', it has a more mature feel to it
What if I want something more 'poppy'?
Expectation is good for a pop song. Twinkle Twinkle is good as well.
Cool, I'll listen to that. What about solo singers?
There's a singer called IU, she's pretty popular.
What genre of music does she sing?
A lot of ballads, but she has some good pop songs.
I'll listen to her then!
