Almost football time!
You know it!
We've got to catch some games this year.
Will the little woman let you out of the house?
Well, Sunday for sure. You know we play pool on Mondays.
That bites. Do they have it on the big screen down there?
Usually. Sometimes they slip up.
I can't imagine missing the Monday night games.
i usually DVR it in case it is a great game. If it is lame, I haven't missed anything.
Can you stay up that late? You have that day job.
Well, it's only sixteen times a year.
That Pittsburg game was fantastic.
You know, Roethlisberger is real good.
He was that week; like 400 yards.
I'd hate to be a running back on that team!
He's good too; he was a college star at MSU.
I think they won 5 Super bowls maybe.
Six maybe; you're talking about Roger Stauback too.
No, that was Terry Bradshaw. He's on Fox Sports now.
Well, he was good too.
