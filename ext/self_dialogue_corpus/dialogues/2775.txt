When did the draft begin anyway?
It began in 1936.
How did that go?
Well,when the professional football first began, players went to the winningest team, best place to live. etc
So draft was to fix that?
Well not so much fix the player's p-references, but the poor smaller teams had no way of getting out of their slump
That woudl make a lot of sense
Yep, so Bert Bell, who owned Eagles at the time, suggested to the owners that they make a pool of the players
Oh, and then select the players from worst team to first team order?
Yep. That woudl always give the first pick to the worst team in theleague
Which would improve the team
Yes. which is why at the level of the NFL, the teams are so evenly matched.
That's why predicting NFl games is so dificult.
Precisely.
I can predict college football pretty good
Totally different settings. The CFB and NFL. No startegy you use in the CFB will work in the NFL
So the other owners didn't hve problems with that idea apparently?
no. it passed unanimously
There's a funny story about all that.
What's that?
