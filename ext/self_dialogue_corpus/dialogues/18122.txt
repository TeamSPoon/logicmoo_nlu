Do you have any songs that are guilty pleasures?
No, not really.
Oh, c'mon. Aren't you the girl who still listens to the Spice Girls?
And I don't feel guilty about it!
Ha! They did have some good songs.
See? Why should you feel guilty about something you like?
Point taken. I guess it's just that music like that doesn't get much respect.
Well, it's basically just bumble gum pop. It's not changing the world.
Bubble gum pop. I like that.
Well, it's just music that makes you feel good. And there's nothing wrong with that.
I think one criticism is that's it's too formulaic.
So? Again, some songs are just about having fun.
In other words, the formula works?
Right. You don't always have to try to reinvent the wheel here.
I don't think many songs try to do that.
I'm just saying sometimes it's cool to just have a simple beat and catchy lyric.
Or catchy beat and simple lyric.
Ha, that works too. Sometimes all I want to do is sing along in my car to a fun song.
One of life's little pleasures.
And I don't feel a bit guilty about it!
