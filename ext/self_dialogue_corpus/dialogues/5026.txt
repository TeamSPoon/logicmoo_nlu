The San Francisco Giants have had key players out due to injuries.
Unfortunate, especially since their pitching is hurting.
They do need a better bull pen.
Pitcher Madison Bumgarner's injury was his own fault.
I heard the Owner was mad at him.  Who can blame the Owner when Bumgarner is paid so much!
Matt Cain is pitching well at home.  He is also hitting decently.
Finally.  Did you hear that Hunter Pence is now injured?
Yes.  He will be out with a hamstring injury for 4 weeks.
It is good to have short stop Brandon Crawford back.
Since he came back the Giants are winning again.
How about that kid, Arroyo?  Only 21 years old.
No kidding!  He has been a great addition.
Catcher Buster Posey has a good string of homers and is handling the bat well.
Yep, he is a good all around player.
You are right, he also fills in at first base.
Manager Bruce Botchey used to be a catcher.
Yes, you can tell by the way he walks.
His walk is very stiff looking.
They squat in that position for so long during a game.
I think it is the most difficult position in baseball.
