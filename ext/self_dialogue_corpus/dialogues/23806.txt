Have you seen Sixth Sense?
I see dead people.
Ok.  So I guess you have.  Do you like those kind of films?
Yeah.  I guess I sorta do.  They make you think a lot.
M. Night what's his face is a good director.
I can't pronounce his last name either.
His other films were not as thoughtful to me.
Hey, did you get to see that one with DiCaprio in it?
Titantic?
Na.  The one he recently did about those people who robbed people in their dreams.
Robbed people in their dreams?  That sounds heavy.  Tell me about it.
It was so intense.  I don't know.  You'll have to watch it.
What is it called?
Inception.
I think I heard of it.
It will definately make you think.
There aren't very many movies out that will do that.
I agree.
Can we watch it now?
I brought my copy with me.
