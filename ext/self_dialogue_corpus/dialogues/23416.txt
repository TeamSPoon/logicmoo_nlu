Did you see Get Out?
Is that a comedy?
No but it was directed by Jordan Peele
The guy from Key and Peele?
Yes that one
And it was not a comedy?
No it was a suspense movie
Really? I cant believe that.
Well you gotta believe it.
I have to check it out I guess
It is a very intense film.
When you say suspense do you mean like horror suspense?
I dont want to give away the plot line by telling you.
Ok I will check it out then
It was very good for a guy who doesnt do that genre.
Just because he does comedy does not mean he cant do anything else.
True but most times guys stay in their lanes
Now I really want to see it because its such a breakaway from what he does
Yeah I was delighted by the film
I hope its on DVD when I get home!
