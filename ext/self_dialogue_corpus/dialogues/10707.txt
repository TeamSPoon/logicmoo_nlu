Hi.
Hey.
Would you consider yourself a fan of fast and the furious?
Yeah I would say so, but not a huge fan or anything.
Yeah I would say the same about myself.
Do you have a favorite movie?
I liked the first one the best.
I saw the first one on the other day and it took me back.
Yeah reminds me of where I was when that came out.
Hard to believe they're still making them.
