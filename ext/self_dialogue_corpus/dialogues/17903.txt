Do you remember Jason Mraz?
I love him man. I have almost all of his records.
Well I think he is going to launch some new stuff soon. He is posting a bunch of new videos on YouTube.
That's awesome I have to see them!
Wait, but they're not videos of new songs; it is just him talking and making jokes.
Oh, so you are just guessing that he will came with something new soom?
Yes. Because I follow him on YouTube and he hadn't posted anything in a while and now he is trying to get viewers all of a sudden.
Well I do hope you are right.
Me too. I want to hear some new things by him.
He is a one of a kind musician. His style is so fresh.
Yes. Few can do it like him.
But you know, I think I liked him better in his older albums.
Me too. Meaning until "We sing. We Dance. We Steal Things".
Absolutely. Even the next album, "Love Is A Four Letter Word" had a couple of very good songs, but the best were in the previous ones.
He was a bit more loose and upbeat.
Exactly. I loved when he put tons of words into a single verse and just gave the whole thing an awesome style.
I loved that too. Now a days he is a bit more mellow.
Yeah. Still an unbelievable artist though.
No doubt about it. We'll have to keep our eyes open for any bit of new music from him.
Absolutely. Let me know as soon as you hear something.
