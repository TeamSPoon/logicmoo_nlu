Have you heard Chained to the Rhythm yet?
Sadly, yes.
Why so negative?
I can't stand Katy Perry. And the music video is awful.
Why do you hate her? She's such a good force for acceptance.
Because she can't sing.
Excuse me? She's a multi-millionaire pop singer.
Yes, but have you heard her live and without autotune? She can't do it!
How do you know? You haven't seen her live.
She was on carpool karaoke and stunk it up.
