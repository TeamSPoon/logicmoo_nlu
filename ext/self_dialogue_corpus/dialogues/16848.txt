Just listening to my favorite classical.
It's not my genre, but okay.
Haha, I know, it's not everyone's cup of tea, but really it's genius and the roots of a lot of modern music.
So what's this?
Handel's Water Music. It's been my fave for years - I can pretty much whistle the whole album.
It is pretty catchy and happy.
Yes! I love all the composers who wrote mostly major-note, happy music
Who else did stuff like that?
I'm not expert, but Haydn is another one - Mozart, Bach and Beethoven all have uplifting pieces I like.
Name some and I will listen to some YouTube videos.
Beethoven Ode to Joy, Bach Jesu, Joy of Man's Desiring, anything by Haydn.
And Handel? What besudes Water Music?
The Royal Fireworks are great too and often in the same recording as Water Music.
When you say "same recording?"
Classical works are multi-part affairs. Just Google Handel St. Martin in the Fields and you will get both works. Great orchestra.
How do you know so much about this stuff.
Mmom sent me to summer music school for guitar and I took a Composers class. Dad tortured me with it as a child.
And now you love it?
Just like Brussels Sprouts and coffee - two great things you hate as a kid and love as an adult. hehe
I'll take Handel you take the Brussels Sprouts. hahaha
