Who would you say had the most recognizable voice in Aladdin?
I think Gilbert Gottfried as Iago. There's no mistaking that voice!
I agree. Although Robin Williams is a close second as Genie.
You know, if you consider how much he brought that character to life, you could say he's the most recognizable.
True. The jokes and little nuances of the Genie definitely couldn't have been brought by anyone else.
Yes! Especially when he first comes out of the lamp.
I'd say the best was when he was making Aladdin into a prince.
Pretty much any time he changed into something else was amazing!
I agree. And that shirt he wears when he's finally set free?
Definitely taken right from Robin Williams' wardrobe!
