I know this is old, but have you seen "10 Things I Hate about You?"
Does it have Heath Ledger in it?
Yes, it's a high school movie.
Oh, that's right.  I think I've seen it.
It also has Julia Stiles in it.  Her dad is an obstetrician.
Yes!  I saw that on tv last summer.  It's pretty cute.
Did you know it's based on Taming of the Shrew?
It is?  In what way?
Well, Kat, Julia Stiles, is the mean older sister, and her little sister is the beautiful Bianca.
Wasn't there an older version of that movie with Elizabeth Taylor?
Yes, "10 Things I Hate About You" is not as accurate as that one.
What other similarities does it have to the play?
Well, Heath Ledger's character is called Patrick Verona.
Isn't Kat's friend obsessed with Shakespeare?
Yes, and they also pay homage to him by writing Shakespearean sonnets in their English class.
That's where the title comes from, right?
Yes, That's a fun movie to use for a Shakespeare reference.
I remember I really liked the soundtrack.
I like the end where the band is playing on the roof of that school.
Can you imagine going to a high school that looked like that?
