what do you think is the saddest scene in Disney
either up or lion king
honestly I was going to say the same.
mufasa and the adulthood scene
I almost cried in the theaters during up
that scene was beautiful
pixar is so great at those emotive scenes
that was them at their finest
so sad...and then mufasa dying.
that haunted me
