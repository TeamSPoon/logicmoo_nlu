Of all the Star Trek movies, I think I enjoyed "Wrath of Khan" the most.
I think most Star Trek fans would agree with you. Except maybe for "Undiscovered Country".
Yeah, that was a good one, too. I have to admit, any Star Trek movie that has Kirk/Spock moments really make me happy.
Oh? You're a Kirk an Spock fan?
Well, of course. I think I liked Spock best for a long time, but gradually I began to like Kirk's character even more.
Why is that? I mean, why switch from one character to another?
I don't know. I think, actually, I was enjoying the rapport between Spock and Kirk, really - I mean, Nimoy and Shatner.
Yeah, they seemed really well suited for each other. At least, when they were working together.
"Wrath of Khan" really showed viewers that relationship, and played it against a really great villain.
You mean Khan, right? That was Ricardo Montalban, and he played khan in the Original Series episode, "Space Seed".
Yes, he did. Sometimes I think he "got" the character better in the film.
Yeah- he grew as a bad guy, getting even stronger than before.
I can't get that vision of his big chest out of my mind! Shatner said he took the role very seriously, and really worked out for the part.
Huh, kind of makes you wish Shatner had worked as hard. He was getting a little pudgy again.
Form what I heard, he lost a lot of  weight for "Star Trek: The Motion Picture". Maybe it was getting too hard for him to lose that weight.
Old age gets the best of us. I don't even know how old he was when they shot that. Maybe his early 60's?
I guess so. Nimoy was noticeably older, but he never had to lose weight. I loved that about him.
Wasn't he really tall, too?
I don't know. They always said that Shatner had to wear lifts, but I saw him in person myself, and the guy is only two inches shy of six feet.
So Nimoy had to be at least six foot and a few inches. That's one tall Vulcan.
