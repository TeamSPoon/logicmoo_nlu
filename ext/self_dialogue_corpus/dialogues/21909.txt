Have you seen many Stanley Kubrick movies?
I saw 'A Clockwork Orange' in college, but I'm not sure of any others he did.
His most famous other than that is probably 'The Shining'.
Oh, yes I have seen that creepy movie. What else did he direct?
He did '2001: A Space Odyssey', as well. The one with HAL, the computer.
I haven't seen that movie but I feel like I've heard a lot about it.
It was pretty groundbreaking when it came out, in terms of set design.
It's from the 1960s, isn't it? It doesn't look it.
Yes, it was released in the 60s. But as you say, it stands up to the test of time.
It's easy for old technology movies to look outdated very quick, but '2001' doesn't at all.
'Eyes Wide Shut' is another one of Kubrick's, with Nicole Kidman and Tom Cruise.
I heard about that but never saw it - it was quite controversial.
Most of Kubrick's films were. He himself actually banned 'A Clockwork Orange'.
He banned it himself? Why?
He and his family were getting death threats after it came out because of the violence.
That's kind of ironic, given the story of that film.
Yes! So he banned it for him and his family's safety. It wasn't released again until his death.
Oh wow, that's fascinating. I had no idea.
There was quite a market for bootleg copies of 'A Clockwork Orange' before he died.
Oh, I can imagine. A story around it like that only fuels interest.
