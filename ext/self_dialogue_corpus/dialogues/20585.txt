Want to hear something crazy?
Sure.
My wife has never seen the Goonies!
What! That's unacceptable.
That's what I said!
What kind of person has never seen the Goonies?
Right?! She also hasn't seen Top Gun!
The single greatest movie of our lifetime and she hasn't seen it?
Nope.  Looks like we're going to be binge watching some classics this weekend.
Top Gun is so good, how has she never watched it?
I'm not sure, she was more into other movies I guess, or TV shows.
Still. Tom Cruise and Val Kilmer killed it in that movie.
I agree, I think it may be Tom Cruise's best movie.
I'm going to have to agree with you on that, but Mission Impossible is a close second.
Can't argue with that, Jerry Maguire has to be third then.
I liked Jerry Maguire, but I'm going to go with Risky Business for number 3.
I forgot all about that movie!  I'm adding it to the list, the wife probably hasn't seen that either.
Did you want to get together one of these weekends and binge watch some Tom Cruise?
I'm down.
Alright, let me know when you can do it.
