What is your favorite character in Star Wars?
I'd have to say it was Luke.
I like Luke as well.
Yeah he was great in the Empire Strikes Back.
His acting was phenomenal.
Yes it was... there was definitely suspension of disbelief.
His interaction with R2D2 tugged at the heart-strings.
It sure did. That little robot was fantastic.
I was worried it was going to get destroyed during the fighter scenes.
Yeah, me too! It was scary!
