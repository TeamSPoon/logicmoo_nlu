How come 90's fashion is coming back?
Right?! I thought I would never see this come again.
Honestly. It's the worst.
I know. I saw a velore shirt the other day.
Well, I saw raised sandels.
I don't know what peeople are thinking
It's not like the stuff was cute even when we were wearing it.
I know!!! I don't care what anyone says. Those boob stripe shirts were awful.
Or how about wearing dresses that literally looks like lengire?
God! That was a terrible look.
Can't believe our parents let us do that.
It was the in thing to do.
Why do they have to bring it back though?
Next thing you know we will all be looking like we just came off the set of Buffy
Lord, please no.
Lisa Frank will come back into style.
Can you even imagine?
Everyone walking around looking like crap
Someone has to do something.
You first.
