Hey, have you heard any good songs lately?
Yeah, I was just listening to that song Drinking Problem on the country station.
Oh yeah, that one has great lyrics!
Yeah, and a good tune, too.  It's by Midland.
I've never heard of them.
Well that's probably because Drinking Problem is their debut single.
Maybe they'll have more good music in the future.
I guess it's possible.  Their first album came out in 2016 but I don't think it's done too well.
Is that the only popular song from it?
Yes, so far.  So that's not a good sign.
Oh yeah, I would think there'd be at least several good songs.
Yeah.  And sales on the album haven't been too great.
Hmm.  Well at least that one song is good!
Yeah, true.  Have you heard anything else good lately?
No, I've been listening to some older country stuff.  Some Luke Bryan and Jason Aldean.
I love Jason Aldean!  That Any ol Barstool song is great.
Yeah, it has a great tune and lyrics.  I love it too.
A lot of his music is great, though.
Yeah, definitely.  He's had more success than Midlands.
That's for sure!
