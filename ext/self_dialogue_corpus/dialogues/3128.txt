Who do you think is better, Peyton or Eli?
Obviously Eli.
How can you say that?
Because Eli had two rings first.
Yea but that alone doesn't make him better.
How so?
Peyton is taller, bigger, and has more experience.
To me that just means he's slower, easier to tackle, and older.
Peyton has more yards.
Yea but that's because he played more games.
That's bull. He more touchdowns.
Again, it's because he's an older player.
How many pro bowl nominations does eli have?
3 I think.
Peyton has 12.
Ok, but what else do you have? Eli is still better in my mind.
Yea, and only in your mind. Just admit it.
Look, they are both amazing.
Ok fine, finally we agree on something.
Yea, they will both end up in the hall of fame.
