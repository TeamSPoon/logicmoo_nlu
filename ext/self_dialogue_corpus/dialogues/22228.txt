Superhero movies have been so popular in recent years.
I know what you mean. At least that movie Logan was kind of a different twist.
Which superhero was that based on.
Logan was based on Wolverine. He's one of the X-men, and they've done plenty of X-men movies.
So what was different about Logan?
Hugh Jackman, the character who plays Logan, plays a slightly older character. Patrick Stewart's character becomes quite fragile, as you probably saw in the film's advertisements.
I noticed that. Isn't there also some sort of little girl in the movie, too?
Yes. I don't want to ruin it for you; she has powers that are kind of similar to Logan's.
I don't mind if you tell me what happens. What happens to Patrick Stewart's character?
His character actually does die.
I figured. Patrick Stewart played in some sort of cartoon movie recently as well, didn't he?
He does voice acting for a movie coming out called The Emoji Movie.
Is that a cartoon movie?
Technically, it's computer animated.
Who does Patrick Steward do the voice of?
He's the poop character, if you can believe it.
That's so funny. What would he do that character?
Perhaps it was the only type of character he could find that was a difficult stretch for him.
When does that movie come out?
It's scheduled for the summer of 2017.
