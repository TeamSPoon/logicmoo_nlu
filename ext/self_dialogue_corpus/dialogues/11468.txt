What's your favorite Beatles song?
I really love Strawberry Fields Forever.
Yeah, Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band is a great album.
It's hard to choose, but I think that is my favorite Beatles album.
So do you like Paul McCartney or John Lennon more as a singer?
As lyricists they are both amazing, but I'd say I prefer McCartney singing.
I can't get enough of Elenor Rigby.
That is another song that is near the top of my list.
Are you offended by all the drug references?
No, I think they all serve a greater creative purpose for the songs as a whole.
