I'm not sure whether I like Jennifer Lawrence movies or not.
She's been in a lot of movies.
I know, and they're all really different. I'm just not sure what to think of them.
Did you like the Hunger Games series?
It was okay. I liked the books better.
Did you like Silver Linings Playbook?
I never saw it.
Maybe you should. I think you'd like her in that a lot.
Yeah, it might be worth a watch, but I never got around to it.
How about Passengers? We saw that the other week.
I kind of liked that movie. But I couldn't really tell who she was as a character in it.
Yeah, I know what you mean a little bit on that one. She spent half the movie really angry at Chris Pratt.
She seems like a good actress. I just think the right movie needs to come along for her.
She was great in Silver Linings Playbook. It was like it was written for her.
Is it a funny movie? I don't like sad movies.
It had funny moments definitely.
Maybe I'll have to see it then. I feel like I want to be a Jennifer Lawrence fan, but just haven't seen a really good movie with her in it yet.
I think she's good in most movies she's in.
Maybe I won't like Silver Linings Playbook as much as I think then.
I bet you will.
