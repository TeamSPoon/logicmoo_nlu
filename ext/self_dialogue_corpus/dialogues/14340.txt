So what do you think off the playoffs so far?
It's been awesome so far.
Yeah I really love the Celtics.
I do to but I don't think they are going to win.
You don't, so who do you think is going to win?
The Cavaliers probably.
I think the Celtics will win.
Not me.
I know it went to 7 games with Washington but they will succeed against the Cavaliers.
Maybe
What do you think about the GSW and SAS game?
Oh GSW for sure.  They are already up 3 games
Yeah, you are probably right.
I know I am.
So what about the championship, predictions?
GSU
It's tough.  I really want the Celtics to win.
I think it will be GSU and Cleveland.
How many game will it go to?
7 for sure.
