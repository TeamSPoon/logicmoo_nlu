Who has hit the most home runs in major league baseball?
Barry Bonds, who hit 762 home runs in his career.
Didn't he use performance enhancing drugs during his career?
I'm not sure, but allegedly he did.
I'm sure Hank Aaron did not during his career.
I agree, though that was before there were tests for steroids.
Didn't Hank Aaron have the most hits all time also?
Actually, no. That is Pete Rose who has the most hits.
I heard Pete Rose was banned from being in the hall-of-fame.
Yes, but it was not for steriod use, but for betting on baseball.
That's a shame, because he was such a great hitter.
Yes. He even helped his team to the World Series a few times.
Who did Rose play for in the World Series?
The Cincinnati Reds twice and the Philadelphia Phillies.
Did the Phillies just win the World Series a few years ago.
Yes, back in 2008 in fact.
Who did they beat to win the championship.
They beat the Tampa Bay Rays, who were in the World Series for the first time.
I read where the Yankees beat the Phillies the next year, in 2009.
Correct, and it was Derek Jeter's last World Series.
