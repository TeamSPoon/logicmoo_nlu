what was your favorite nine inch nails album
probably the fragile
i liked broken better
wish was just an ep, right?
yeah, but i liked last and wish so much
better than songs on the downward spiral?
yeah. i never liked the album much
thats their biggest album though
the album was dark and conceptual but not great on replay
thats the issue with concept albums sometimes
yeah, the songs take a hit
in favor for the stories
did you like the fragile
i liked some songs
like what
we are in this together and the song dedicated to his grandma
i am looking forward to joining you is the song for his grandma
that song is so sad.
its very poetic too
i listen to it alot
