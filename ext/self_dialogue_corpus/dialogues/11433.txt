I heard the Beatles were super into Indian music in the 60s. Trippy.
Yeah, I know some of their songs use sitar, but I think it really depends which ones you listen to how much it actually sounds like Indian music.
Oh?
Yeah, well the sitar on "Norwegian Wood" really just sounds like a guitar part to me, just played on the sitar.
True.
But if you listen to something like "Love You To," that has way more Indian influences. I think George had taken more lessons by that point.
What kind of Indian influences?
Drone, percussion, improvised bits, bent notesâ€”lots of cool stuff!
Are there any other songs that used the sitar besides the Beatles?
Oh yeah, definitely. Listen to "Paint it Black" by the Rolling Stones!
