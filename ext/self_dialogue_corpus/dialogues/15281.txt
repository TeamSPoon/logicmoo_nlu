What musician do you think is underrated?
I know he is actually very popular but harry stiles.
How is he underrated?
Well what comes to mind when you think of him?
Boy bands, hair and teen girls. Maybe x factor.
Well that is what I mean. He is actually a really talented songwriter.
He writes songs? I assumed they had them given to them.
well he does not write all of one direction's music by any means but has written some.
It is also rumored he has written songs for others under an alias.
oh ya , like what?and who?
Alex & Sierra 's  I love you, also apparently written songs for  Ariana Grande and Gavin Degraw.
I did not know that at all. More than cute face!
Much more I say. Have you heard his song sign of the times?
Yes I know that song but did not realize it was him.
Yes he wrote that song. It was actually inspired by a mother dying after giving birth.
Woah that is nuts, I thought it was about guns or the state of the world today.
The lyrics are so genius and universal they can be seen in many ways.My point is overall he is not given enough credit or respect he deserves.
I am beginning to agree with you. Even with his crazy popularity there is a lot to know and admire.
It is almost a detriment to his talent that he is lumped in with the image of one direction.
But that is not that bad.. come on, super popular and successful band.
