Is Future the best rapper around right now.
No I would say Kendrick.
I dont think thats true.
Sure it is look at his album sales.
Yeah but thats not indicative of skill
Yes it is, thats the only measure.
Not true, he  has abilities past that.
I think Lamar is good for 3 more albums.
Thats a sign of longevity in todays game.
Or he could join a rap supergroup.
