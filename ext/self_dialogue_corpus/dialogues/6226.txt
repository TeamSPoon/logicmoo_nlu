Did you ever see Meet the Robinsons?
That was such a cute movie. It reminds me of The Incredibles.
I'd have to say that's my favorite Disney movie.
Mine is Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.
You know I've never actually seen the original Snow White.
Oh you have to see it, it's a classic.
I've never seen Bambi either.
Well that's not so bad. You didn't have to be traumatized as a kid like everybody else.
Someone shot Bambi's mom right?
Yes and left a scar on children forever and ever. Cinderella is another good Disney classic
