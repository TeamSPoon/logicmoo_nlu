Last night I went to my first concert.
Who did you see?
It was a Green Day concert.
I like them, but I've never seen them in concert.  Was it a good show?
It was a typical rock show with very loud music.
I always leave those kind of shows with ringing ears.
My ears were definitely ringing and I went home with only one shoe.
How did you lose a shoe?
I was in general admission and it got a little rough a few times.
That's funny that you lost a shoe in a mosh pit.
It wasn't funny to walk around there without a shoe though.
I'm sure it wasn't.
Also, it was pretty cool to see them smash all their equipment at the end of the show.
They must be making a lot of money if they can afford to destroy equipment at every show.
I don't know if they do it every time, but I can imagine even once would be expensive.
Did they destroy just the speakers or what?
It seemed like they smashed everything: the drums, microphones, amplifiers, and instruments.
I've seen drums thrown around at concerts, but never destruction of a complete stage full of equipment.
It was a first for me.  The music was loud and intense so maybe they just got carried away.
Sounds entertaining in any case.
