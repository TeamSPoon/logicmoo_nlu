Was that street race intense in part 1?
You mean the one where Paul Walker lost his car?
Yes.
I loved that scene. I thought for sure he would win.
The first Fast and the Furious was so good.
Yeah, especially that scene.
When his laptop told him the car was in danger, I knew he was not going to win.
I agree.
Vin Diesel was definitely gonna win that race from the start.
It was fun to watch though.
