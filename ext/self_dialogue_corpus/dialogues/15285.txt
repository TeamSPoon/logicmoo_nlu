On the Top 10 list recently, I noticed Justin Bieber's song Let me Love You is number 1.
Wow, I can't believe that!  That is amazing.
DJ Snake did a video on Vevo , and it was amazing.
I saw that video, it had over 371 million views.
Do you like any of his other songs?
As long As You Love Me is great, and also Love Yourself are some great songs I love of his.
I have been to some concerts of his, and they were pretty packed with teenagers!
Oh yes, that is so funny. I noticed that too when I went. It's like the boy crazy deal!
The tickets were around $50 each, I think I got them on sale that weekend.
Mark My Words is also a great video and song of Justin's.
I haven't seen that one lately, but I am sure I have heard it on the radio.
Most of the time on the radio, they are the latest music from him.
U Smile comes on the radio all the time!
Baby used to come on so much that I would get sick of hearing it!
Some of the concert tickets get pretty expensive.
Yes, if you want to get really good seats, expect to pay some good money.
The tickets can get around Superbowl cost.
I believe it, they make some money, and that is not even drinks or food at the conssessions.
Oh, I know.  The venues make a killing too!
They really make money in concerts, like printing money!
