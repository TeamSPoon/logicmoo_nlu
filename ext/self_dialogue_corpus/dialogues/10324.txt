I wonder if they'll do another Sherlock Holmes movie.
Yeah, it's been a while.
They seemed to leave the last one open for a sequel.
Wide open!
At any rate, if they don't do another in that series, I'm sure they'll reboot.
True. There's like a gazillion Holmes movies.
Yeah, and that show.
With Cumberbatch?
Yeah.
That one's kinda weird.
