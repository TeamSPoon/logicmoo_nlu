do you know elliott smith
yeah, he is such a great songwriter
angeles was my favorite
his finger picking in that song is amazing
i dont know how he does it
and sing at the same time???
its incredible
he is one of the best songwriters of our time
my favorite songwriter ever to be honest
maybe the same for me too
say yes, biggest lie
all the no name songs are all so introspective and sad
he is great to listen to when you're sad
yup, no one gets you like elliott
i just go through his discography when im upset
he should be as known as the beatles
i agree with you
its a shame he had to die
yeah, i wish he was alive
who knows what music he'd have now
