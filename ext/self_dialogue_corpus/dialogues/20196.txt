What is your favorite animated movie?
South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut.
I kind of meant kid-friendly animated movie, but that movie was hilarious.
Oh, in that case, Finding Nemo.
Also a great choice, although I tend to like Shrek more.
Shrek was funny. I think Eddie Murphy as Donkey was my favorite part.
I just liked the Dreamworks animated movies because they didn't take themselves as seriously as the Pixar movies.
I don't think that Finding Nemo took itself too seriously.
I agree, but I was referring more to films like WALL-E and Up.
I thought that WALL-E was one of the best movies of 2008.
Really? I found it incredibly boring and found its various criticisms of excess to be trite.
I completely disagree. Furthermore, I think that the lack of dialogue led to some beautiful moments that a Dreamworks film wold never have.
When I go to an animated film, I'm not looking to see something serious. I'm looking to laugh, which Shrek makes me do.
Agree to disagree. Can we at least agree that Toy Story is a great franchise?
No disagreements here. I think that Toy Story balances the humor and a deeper message very well.
Also,  I think that Tim Allen and Tom Hanks are excellent voice actors.
That's probably my favorite Tim Allen film. He can be really talented when he is not doing Christmas movies.
What about Wild Hogs? That was a really bad movie.
True, although I really liked John Travolta's performance in that film.
To be honest, with the exception of Martin Lawrence, all of the performances in that movie were very forgettable.
