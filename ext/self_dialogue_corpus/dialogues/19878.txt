Do you listen to Mastodon?
What is Mastodon?
They're a relatively new metal band.
I never heard of them. I like Meshuggah and Slipknot.
Mastodon is not quite as heavy as Meshuggah or Slipknot, but they are great musicians and write interesting songs.
That sounds cool. I've just recently started getting into metal, so I'm on the lookout for more good stuff.
You should definitely give Mastodon a try, they have been called "the masters of metal" by reviewers.
That's pretty impressive. What do you think makes them so good?
Well, they are all very accomplished musicians. The drums are at a virtuoso level and the vocals are melodic but not operatic like some of the more annoying metal bands.
That's cool. I get a little bored with the same growling style that a lot of new death-metal bands are doing.
Yeah, that's exactly my feeling as well. A little of it is interesting, but not constantly on every track.
Does Mastodon do any death-metal growling?
Actually they don't do any of that at all. They aren't a death metal band.
Who are they similar too?
I think, instrumentally, they kind of remind of Rush, but more intense and metal sounding. The vocals remind me of Ozzy Osbourn at times.
That doesn't sound like a description of the typical modern metal band.
I would say that's an accurate assessment. The hardest aspect of their sound is probably the drums.
How would you characterize their sound? What makes them unique?
They have a sound that is kind of primitive and primordeal, but the music is complex and sophistocated at the same time. It's hard to explain how that works without hearing it.
They sound pretty interesting. I'll have to give them a listen.
