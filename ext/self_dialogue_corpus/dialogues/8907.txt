Have you gone to any rock concerts?
Yes I've been to a few, like Journey and Black Sabbath.
How was Steve Perry singing live?
He sounded real good, just like the albums.
Because some bands sound awful when you see them live.
Yes but Journey was great.
What was your 1st rock concert?
It was Elton John, and then Van Halen. What about you?
My 1st concert was Quiet Riot and Twisted Sister.
That must have been good.
