Sting will be coming, so I have booked his concert.
What songs do you like of Sting?
Fields of Gold, and Set Them Free are some of my favorites!
Oh yes, I saw him in concert with Annie Lennox one time.
Really?
Yeah, Annie opened for him , and she played on stage with him at some point for that concert.
That one was phenomenal I bet.  So action packed.
Yes, they were phenomenal.
I hope Annie tours again in my area soon.
She may come but you might have to travel to see her.
Ok, sounds good!  I can't wait.
She is one of the best singers.
