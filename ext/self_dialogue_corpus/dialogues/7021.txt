Have you ever seen the movie "Beauty and the Beast"?
Yes.  I saw it years ago when it came out as animation.
I really liked it.  I thought it was a beautiful love story.
I actually thought it was pretty great as well.  Could you believe the voice of the Beast was Robbie Benson?
I was surprised when I found that out.  I remember pictures of him on Tiger Beat magazine when he was a teenager.
He did a great job though.  I guess you never know.
Have you seen the version that just came out with live people?
I haven't seen it yet.  I heard it was pretty good though.
I wonder how they did some of the scenes with real people.
I think I will see it, but I will probably wait until it comes out on Netflix or Direct TV.
