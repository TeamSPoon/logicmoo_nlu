I want togo see Wonder Woman soon, but not sure if it is playing this weekend yet.
Wonder Woman came out in the beginning of June, so it should be available to see in theaters still.
Do you know who stars in it, for Wonder Woman?
I think it is Gal Gadot who plays the part, and Chris Pine is also in this one too.
I can't wait to see it, I am a big Wonder Woman fan.
It has gotten some great reviews from the critics.
How much has it made money wise?
The box office has made $485 million dollars so far and counting.
That is a huge success!
Yes, they are doing well with that movie.
