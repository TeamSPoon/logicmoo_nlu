Hey do you know when the Saints play against the Patriots?
No but ill look it up for you
That would be great
The play September 17
Does it say what time the game starts
It starts at noon  Who are you rooting for
The Saints of course.
Really you know Tom Brady will destroy Drew Brees.
I dont think so Tom Brady is way to old to be playing now
Seriously Tom Brady is 39 and Drew Brees is 38 Not much of a difference.
It doesnt matter the Patriots dont need to win the Saints are a better team
All the Saints do is pay 1 million dollars to a quarter back that claims nothing is ever his fault
Brees has a 1 million dollar arm
Tom Bradys arm is better them Brees and he didnt get 1 million in 2016
Who is the highest paid quarterback in the NFL right now
In 2016 Eli Manning was paid $24,200,000
Wow i wish i could make that in 5 years.
I know  Wonder what the players from the 80s and 90s are thinking right now
That they should have asked for way more.
Definatly i would have.
