Are there any movies out that you want to see?
Not really, but my husband wants to see Wonder Woman.
Oh, that looks good.  You don't want to see it?
Not really.
Why not?
I've never been a big super hero movie fan and I really don't care about Wonder Woman.
You don't like any super hero movies?
I liked Guardians of the Galaxies.
That was good.  What kind of movies do you like?
Horror or comedy mostly.
What do you think about that new mummy movie?
I'm not sure.  Is it supposed to be like The Mummy from a few years back?
I don't think so.  This is supposed to be more horror than action adventure.
It's kind of confusing with the same name.
Oh, I know what you mean.
I think that shark movie might be alright.
47 Meters Down?
Yeah, it probably sucks, but it's something different.
Yeah, like the new Jaws.
Nothing will ever beat Jaws.
