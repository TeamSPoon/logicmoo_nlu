So what happened to Rock music?
I dont know?
I mean does it even still exist?
It does but on such a smaller scale I guess
I tuned in on the local rock music station and heard music from the 90's. I don't think  I heard anything new
Yea, I've heard
I know there are a lot of great rock bands out there, just not any big ones
Yea , I keep waiting for the next big thing to come out
I've been waiting for a while
We need a really great new rock act to come out
