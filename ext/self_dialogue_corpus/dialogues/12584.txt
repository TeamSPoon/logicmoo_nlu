Have you heard about the new Han Solo movie that's being made?
What? But I thought Han Solo died in The Force Awakens?
He did. This movie is going to focus on him as a young man and his life prior to the events of the original Star Wars
Who is going to play him in the film?
I read they cast Alden Ehrenreich
I don't think I know who that is
He's not very famous but he looks like he could be a good fit for the role
Is J.J. Abrams directing this film?
No, Ron Howard was just hired this week as the director.
Oh, great! I love Ron Howard!
