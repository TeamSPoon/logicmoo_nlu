Do you know who N.W.A. is?
Of course they were some revolutionary rappers.
That's correct.
They defied the odds and society as a whole to become something great and push rap forward.
I couldn't of said it any better.
Didn't they release a movie about that whole situation?
They did or a show.
I think it was a show.
Who founded the group do you know?
I think it was Ice Cube and Dr Dre originally.
Weren't they young adults or teens.
I think when the idea sprouted they were still considered teens yes.
That's crazy to think about.
Maybe there young age allowed them to keep pushing against all odds.
Yeah, maybe they didn't care or know any better.
They definitely knew what they were doing just don't think they wanted to accept the world as it was.
I think you're right when they defied the police when they told them not to play that song with the inappropriate name.
I remember that didn't the police chase them out of the staidum.
They were trying to arrest them.
That's right.
