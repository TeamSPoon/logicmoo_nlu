Do you think Beyonce will make a new album next year with the new babies here?
I'm not sure but she likes to make hits when no one is looking so who knows?
True. What did you think of her last album?
I thought it was good and I like the variety of the music.
I wasn't sure what to make of the one song with the video under water
I thought that was a creative idea for her to use.
I like the album with Girls on it.
Yes but you had to appreciate the way she swings a bat and takes charge of the block.
I don't know how I feel about her portraying violence but she was very pretty.
I don't think it was so much about violence as it was about self expression.
What is self expression in a song that breaks windshields?
Well, she was maybe reflecting on her personal relationship with her husband.
I think she might have been but I like it better when she is more artistic in her videos.
I think you're right.
Like the video with her kicking water and sand on the beach, now that was artistic, wouldn't you say?
I would agree. I did like that drunk in love theme.
I still listen to that song regularly.
Yes, me too.
Do you think she will have her daughter in a video again soon?
Yes and maybe the twins also.
