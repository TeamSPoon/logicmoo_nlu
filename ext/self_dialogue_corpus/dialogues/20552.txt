Did you like The Butterfly Effect?
Yeah I thought it was a good movie
I think Ashton Kutcher did a great acting job.
It worked for him
And Amy Smart was pretty good in the flick as well.
Yeah she was in some intense scenes and acted the heck out of them.
I thought the plot lines connected well.
Did you see the 2nd one?
No didnt that go right to video?
Yes I dont think any of the original cast was in it.
I just dont know how you do a sequel to that kind of movie.
Neither do I, it was cut and dry.
They can turn sequels out of anything.
I dont like when theyre spaced too far apart.
Yeah like Dumb and Dumber.
Exactly, they wait too long.
I think the actors want to seperate themselves from those movies
And then they need a cash grab?
Carey didnt, Daniels didnt so no with that movie
Theres tons though that I could pick and the answer would probably be yes
