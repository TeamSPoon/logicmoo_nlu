What did you think of Lady Gaga's performance with Metallica at The Grammys?
I thought it was fantastic. It's just too bad the sound was ruined.
Did you see the video online where they performed with the sound corrected?
Yes, I did, and that's what made me judge it as fantastic!
What did you like about it specifically?
Lady Gaga's version of the vocals, her powerful voice singing a Metal song in her style.
Me too, I thought she did a phenomenal job.
She made the song better in my opinion. I also liked the energy between her and James Hetfield.
Yes, when they put their heads together and sang sharing the microphone, it was electric.
I really wish there were more songs like this!
