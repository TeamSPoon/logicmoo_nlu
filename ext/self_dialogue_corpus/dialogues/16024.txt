Did you listen to the Red Hot Chili Peppers CD I gave you?
Yes, but only a little.  I keep leaving it in my car.
Did you hear that the Pixies broke up?
Which time?  They do that all the time.  They'll be back...
How come you don't listen to rap?
I do have a few songs.  I can't play it around my kids because of the language.
Did you ever listen to disco?
Yeah, a little back in the late 70s.  I liked some of the Bee Gees songs.
So what do you think of Bruno Mars?
I would have to be a teenaged girl to answer that question.
Have you heard of this guy Ed Sheeran?
Yep.  I haven't listed to much of him but so far I suppose it's OK.
What do you think of The Chainsmokers & Coldplay's new song?
Are you talking about "Something Just Like This"?
I really like the song "Stay" by Zedd & Alessia Cara.
Yeah, it's pretty good.  I've only heard it a couple of times.
Redbone has made Billboard's top 20.
Oh yeah, what song make it that far?
I've totally lost touch with the who's who in music today.
Yeah old man, get with the times.
