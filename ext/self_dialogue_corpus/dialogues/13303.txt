Which star wars movie is your favorite?
My favorite is probably episode 3.
Yeah, that was a good one.  Why is that your favorite?
Because you get to see the birth of darth vader.
Is he your favorite character?
Yes, i have always liked that character since the original trilogy.
Do you think he and Luke are a lot alike?
Yes.  I just think Luke was better at controlling his anger.  It wouldn't surprise me if Luke ended up going to the dark side at some point.
Yeah, i have always thought that about him.
Hopefully he won't, but it just seems like his character is at least partially in touch with the dark side of the force.
