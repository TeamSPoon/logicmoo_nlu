Do you have any horror movies you think are too scary to watch?
Yes, the exorcist.
That one really isnt that scary any more. the special effects are almost laughable.
I just have a thing about possession. There isn't any avoiding it.
There are lots of horrors you can't avoid, though.
That's true, but you can fight them off.
I suppose so.
There is no fighting off possession. They have control over your body
So you're afraid of being locked in your body with no control?
I think that's a valid fear. Having your body taken over by a demon and forced to watch your limbs moving without your sayso. that's scary.
