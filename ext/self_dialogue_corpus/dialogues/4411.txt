We should see a new movie.  Any good ones at the theatre?
There is a new shark movie called 47 meters I think?
Oh yeah, like the next jaws movie.
I haven't read any reviews about it but it's a refreshing change from what's out now.
Yes I remember there was out called Deep Blue.  Didn't care much for it.
No it didn't do well at all.
I wonder if it will be as good as jaws?
I would love to see a remake of the original jaws.
That would be awesome.
Can you imagine what they could do with todays CGI technology?
