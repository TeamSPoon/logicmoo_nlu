What was the last Disney movie you saw.
I saw The Pirates of the Caribbean movie
What did you think?  Was it any good.
I haven't really been a fan of the whole franchise, but it was decent
I saw Beauty and the Beast last week?
What did you think?
I thought it was really good.  I thought everyone did a great job?
How was Emma Watson?  She's hot!
She did a great job.  Her voice was really good.
Glad to hear that, I'll have to see it soon.
