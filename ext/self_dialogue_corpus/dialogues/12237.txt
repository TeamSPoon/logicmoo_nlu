So do you think Han shot first?
Well, what cut are we talking about?  Original or Lucas edited?
Doesnt matter, what do you think happened?
Well, Han only defended himself, so he shot second.
What makes you believe that?
When in any of the movies was he the original aggressor?
Never... I suppose you are right
Exactly!
I suppose Lucas should have never switched the scenes...
I could not agree with you more!
