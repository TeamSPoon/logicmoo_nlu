What song was considered to be the first rap song?
Oh, that was Rapper's Delight.
Who was it that released that?
Sugar Hill Gang, of course!
Oh, yeah, I remembered the band, just not the group.
Yeah, I had to think about the name of the song, but I knew the group offhand.
When was the song released?
It was in the early 80s.  I might have even been 80.
It was such a fun song to listen to.
Yeah, and it was a lot different than anything at the time.
