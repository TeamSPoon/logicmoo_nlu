What musical group thats gone away or you never hear from anymore, would you like to see make a come back?
Well there's a few, but the one that really stands out would be En Vogue
That R&B women's group?
Yes, either them or New Edition or Boys to Men I like them all very much
Yeah I really like them too, I listen to a few of them when I am driving
What song do you listen to most?
I like 'Runaway Love' by En Vogue, I am jamming to that all the time when I drive on the highway
My favorite by En Vogue is 'Free Your Mind'. There is a great message in that one.
Yeah I like that one too
What group would you like to see come back.
I guess TLC, but they are minus one group member
Oh yeah, the Left Eye. She died  years ago.
My favorite music by them was their whole 'Crazy Sexy Cool' album
Do you still listen to their stuff ?
Definitely, they are on my playlist.
I listen to them too. I guess they could make a comeback with two members.
Yeah, I doubt that they ever will though.
Me too. These groups just make a few albums and then they go on and live other lives
It's a shame too. They are so talented and people miss them.
Yeah, but their music will always be there for us to hear.
