Have you seen the Hunger Game first movie?
Yes, it was pretty intense.
Can you imagine having our children ripped from us to go hunt each other?
That is a really crazy thing but I bet there are some countries whose children have to fight to survive.
Do you think you would have traded places with you little sister so she didn't have to go fight like Katniss did in  the movie?
I certainly would have traded places with her, she is so young.  Would you have traded places?
I am pretty certain I would but I don't know for sure.
Do you remember where the Hunger Games took place?
Yes, it took place in Panem which was established after an apocalyptic event.
I don't remember much about Panem.  Can you help me remember a bit?
The nation consisted of the wealthy capital.  Surrounding the capital are twelve poor districts.
That's right and they randomly pick 2 kids from each district to go fight for the death in the games.
It is pretty sad to think that this happened in the movie.  It seemed so real.
I know, you feel like you are right there, a part of the movie.
Do you remember the name of the child who Katniss became friends with?
Yes, during the games, Katniss and Rue become good friends.
Oh yeah and Rue is killed and Katniss killed the tribute who killed Rue.
Do you remember Katniss singing to Rue as she was dying?
She sang to her and then to defy the Capital, she covered Rue's body with flowers.
I was so glad that Katniss did not like the capital and was not afraid to show it.
