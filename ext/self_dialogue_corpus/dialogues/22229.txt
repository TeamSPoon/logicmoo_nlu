What is the most recent movie you saw?
I watched Hacksaw Ridge a couple of weeks ago.
Really? How was it?
It was fantastic. The acting was really good.
Do you prefer to watch war films?
I like history in general. War is a great genre but I enjoy non-fiction work.
I agree. I like drama movies but I can only get into them if they are based on actual events.
What is the last movie you saw?
I can't remember. I saw Logan recently so maybe it was that movie.
Wow! I heard it was great.
It was! However I am not sure if a fictional movie like Logan would be your type.
I am not sure either, but the X-Men films are always good.
You should try to see it soon! I think you'll like it.
Maybe I will. I do enjoy the action in those films.
Have you seen the other X-Men films?
Mostly, though I cannot remember all of them.
I know. There are too many to keep up with.
I think X-Men Origins was my favorite out of the ones I've seen.
If you liked that movie then you will surely enjoy watching Logan.
Great! I am excited to see it!
