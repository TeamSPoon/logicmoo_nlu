Hey, I love your shoes. Where did you get them?
I got these from Ross.
How much did they cost?
I believe I paid less than 20 dollars for them.
That's a great deal. Do you always get your shoes from Ross?
No, I just saw that these were on sale, so I took advantage.
Where do you buy your shoes from?
I really love this online store called "Just Fab." They have great deals.
What type of shoes do they have?
They have all kinds, but they definitely have a great selection for heels.
I'm looking for some that have straps that go up to my knee. Do you think they have some?
Yes, I'm sure they do. I just purchased some thigh high boots from them last week.
How much did you pay for those?
I got a great deal, two for 35 dollars.
What kind did you get?
I got the thigh high boots, and I got some clear pumps to go with my all white dress that I also purchased from them.
Clear pumps with a white dress, that sounds like it would look great together.
Yeah, the white dress comes to my knees, and its tight fitting, I love it.
Did you get that from Just Fab too?
Yes, their dresses are just as great as their shoes.
