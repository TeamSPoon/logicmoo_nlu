Finally saw Tangled last night.
Finally?  You must be really behind on your movies.
Indeed I am.  Anyway, it was really cute!
I love Mandy Moore in it.
She has a great, clear princess voice.
And I give credit to whomever voiced Flynn Rider too.
Oh, completely.  He sounded superb on I See the Light.
That scene is just fantastic. The boat, the lanterns...
The emotion just swelling up in all of us, so touching!
Truly great movie and lovely animation.
