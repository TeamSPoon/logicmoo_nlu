Hey, have a ever seen the movie The Purge?
No, I've heard a little about it, but don't know that much about it. What can you tell me about it.
The Purge is set in a near future AMerica where unemployment  and crime are at all time lows, and the economy is very strong.
Okay, sounds good, but being this is a thriller, I'm thinking there's a catch?
Yes, all this is due to the The Purge, an annual 12 hopur period where all crime is legal and emergency and police serivces are unavailable.
All crime is legal, even murder?
For the movie, particularly murder. The government was taken over by the so-called New Founding Fathers of America, a totalitarian party that used an econmic collapse to rise to power.
So, people can butcher each other wholesale for a 12 hour period once a year?
Yes, but weapons like explosives or rocket launchers are forbidden and government official above a certain level are exempt, on penalty of summary execution.
Okay, soound's violent and crazy. I'll probably love it, thanks for the info.
