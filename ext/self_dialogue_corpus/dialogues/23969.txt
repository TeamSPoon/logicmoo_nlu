What's your favorite superman movie?
I like the very first one.
I like the original one too.
It's just a classic.
Christopher Reeve was perfect for superman.
And Clark Kent.
I agree with that.
Marlon Brando as his father was a great choice.
Another perfect choice.
Gene Hackman as Lex Luther and Margot kidder were both great too.
Perry white was played by Jackie cooper.
The way superman saved Lois Lane was true superman stuff.
I know what you mean
Just a perfectly cast movie.
I have to agree.
I remember it being a long movie.
Yes,I think it was at least 3 hours.
Taking a chance being the first superman movie out.
Yes,to,keep an audience that long it better be good.
And it was.
