Have you seen Star Wars: The Force Awakens?
I did.
What did you think of it?
It turned out to be a pretty good movie. The third act saved it.
Yeah, I thought the stuff leading up to the climax was pretty tedious.
There wasn't enough character development to get me fully invested in the main characters.
The droid was pretty funny though.
Yeah, but it's easy to get people behind a humorous character if it's done well.
In other words, not Jar Jar.
Definitely.
I enjoyed all the callbacks to Epsidoe IV, but thought CGI Tarkin was kind of fake.
That did look pretty phony.
CGI Leia was better, but she was only on screen for a brief period.
The part with Vader mowing rebels down before that was pretty awesome.
Yeah, probably the best part of the movie, though Vader was kind of shoehorned in.
It didn't feel like his subplot really mattered, true.
I don't think it was quite the homerun Disney needed for these spinoff Star Wars films, but it was a decent start.
I agree.
Will you go see the Han Solo movie when it comes out?
I probably will.
