I heard they are in talks for yet another Highlander movie.
They made more than one?
Yes, there six in all.
What? All with Sean Connery?
The second one had him.
But he dies in the first.
It is part prequel, and there is magic involved.
I thought there, could be only one.
Right, but they keep making them .
I thought the premise of the first film was so unique.
It did not do great when it was first released.
Really? Everyone loves it now.
It always reminded me a bit of Braveheart.
With Mel Gibson?
Yes, set in Scotland.
I always thought that was a beautiful movies.
Very sad at the end.
The Princess in that movie, that was her real hair.
It was long as her body.
That was one of her first roles, she cut it after that movie.
