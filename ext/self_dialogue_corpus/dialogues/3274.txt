Isn't it cute that Sarah Michelle Gellar and Freddie Prinze Jr. are still married?
It's adorable! Weren't they in a horror movie together at one point?
Yeah, it's called I Know What You Did Last Summer.
What is that movie about?
It's about a group of people who cover up a car accident and then they're stalked by a killer.
Oh, stalker horror movies are the best.
I know! They always give me the creeps.
Yeah, I start looking over my shoulder a lot more after watching one.
And I get paranoid about hearing things in my house at night.
I guess that's the point of watching a horror movie.
