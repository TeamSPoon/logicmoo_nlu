Do you think there will ever be another Harry Potter movie?
I don't know. Right now Rowling is busy with the Fantastic Beasts movies.
I know originally it was only supposed to be a trilogy and then it changed to have five movies in the series instead.
What about Harry Potter and the Cursed Child. Do you think that could be made into a movie?
From what I've heard, Warner Brothers has no plans of making it into a movie at this time.
I'm hoping that once the Fantastic Beasts movies are done that Rowling might write another Harry Potter book.
Well, I guess she could write one with the kids grown up and have it have something to do with their kids.
Exactly. Remember when the kids were introduced at the end of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows 2?
Yes, she could take it from there.
You know, Deathly Hallows 2 was my favorite movie from the series. I like how Harry defeated Voldemort and how it tied up all the story lines.
My favorite was Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone. It was fun getting an introduction to each of the characters.
Who is your favorite character from the movie?
Besides Harry? That would be Ron Weasley.
He could be really funny. I ended up really liking Snape.
How come?
Well, all this time I thought he was a bad guy, only to find out he was really a good guy after all.
I was rather surprised by that, too.
So, are you planing on seeing all of the Fantastic Beasts movies?
I am.
I don't like them quite as much as the Harry Potter movies, but the first one was still pretty good.
