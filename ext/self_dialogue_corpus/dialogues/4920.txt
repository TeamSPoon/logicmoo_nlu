Have you watched the Phillies lately?
Yeah they havent played well.
They are young though.
I know but I want to see progress.
Wont see it from Mikael Franco.
He looks like he has issues.
He has a loose swing.
Hitting coach needs to clean that up.
They brought in Matt Stairs.
He was more of a power hitter. Not for average.
Yeah but the hitting has improved somewhat.
Pitching never looked great to begin with.
They have a history of not developing pitchers.
They put Jake Thompson in the pen.
Thats a head scratcher. Thought he was their ace.
They dont know what theyre doing.
Probably waiting to see how everyone develops.
Yeah they have promise, just gotta figure it out.
Hopefully sooner before the fanbase turns.
Theyll wait it out. They always do.
