Favorite 80s band?
Metallica without a doubt, they were and still are a great band.
Are they still making music?
Yes they are! They are still on the radio as well.
I really like the older stuff they did, I have not heard any of their newer music though.
The newer stuff is alright, but nothing like the old music they did.
My brother was obsessed with them when we were kids, that is how I know of them.
Who has not heard of Metallica, they are a household name.
Do you like Metallica or ACDC more?
Definitely Metallica, I was never a huge fan of ACDC.
I like songs from both groups.
As do I, but if I had to pick one it would be Metallica.
I do not think ACDC makes music anymore.
I think you are right, although I could of sworn I heard something about them doing a tour.
Really? I wonder if they still can jam like they did 30 years ago.
I am sure they still sound great.
I wish I could of seen Metallica in concert when I was younger.
I hear they put on such an amazing set.
I could imagine so, they probably rock the house good.
Maybe one of these days we can go see them if they tour.
