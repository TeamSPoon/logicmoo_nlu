I really enjoying watching the avengers.
Me too, it was exciting how they were all recruited from they own movies
Yes i love how they made that suspenseful at the end.
Exactly i was trying to figure out what was going on
And then they cam out with the avengers, and i was like ohh
Yea i hope they come out with another one
Me too, i cant get enough of them
Exactly. It was such a genious idea they had
And completely unexpected
Hands down best movie ever
