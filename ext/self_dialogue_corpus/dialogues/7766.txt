I re-watched the first Harry Potter movie today!
Oh, fun. Did you like it?
Yeah, Hermione is my favorite. I can't believe I never watched these before!
Me either, but there's no time like now to catch up.
Haha, yeah. Who's your favorite character?
I think Neville was my favorite by the end.
How come?
You'll see, he's kind of like a version of Harry that's more like a regular person. Like if things had gone differently.
Didn't his actor get super hot or something?
Oh, you mean Matthew Lewis? Yeah, he did, that doesn't hurt, but it's not until the last movie.
