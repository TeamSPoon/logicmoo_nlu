Scream, what are you thoughts?
I liked it. It helped bring back good horror movies.
Yeah, it was a little unpredictable
Yes, like the scene where Drew Barrymore gets it at the beginning
Yes, I wasn't expecting that to happen so early on
Right, she was supposed to be a main character
That was a Wes Craven movie, no?
Yes, Wes Craven of Nightmare on Elm Street fame
Oh yes, classic 80s flick.
Yes, big on the 80s slasher genre
