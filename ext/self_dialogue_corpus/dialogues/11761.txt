Do you know the original title of abbey road before they changed it?
I think it was Everest?
Yes,in reference to the brand of cigarettes smoked by engineer Geoff emerick.
I'm glad they changed it.
They were going to shoot the cover at Mount Everest but they didn't want to travel that far.
Right,paul suggested they name it after the street they were on.
Hahahahah,and it was a lot easier to walk across the street outside the studio than go to Mount Everest.
Yes,they were a little lazy about that.
I'm glad they were.
Yes,it's a classic album cover indeed
