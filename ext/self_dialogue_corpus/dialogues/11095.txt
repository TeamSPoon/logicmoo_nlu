Did you see what she was wearing yesterday?
Yeah, it was really tacky, who wears a skirt with shoes like those?
I know, I would never in a million years expect her to wear something like that.
I think she believes she is setting some type of trend.
It is only a trend if others think it looks good or it starts to become popular.
Yeah, It at least as to have something that pops.
I know, her stuff was just all over the place.  Nothing matched and it just didn't make sense.
Yeah, I was really confused, I thought she was wearing an outfit for a play or something, I didn't realize it was suppose to be an every outfit.
Maybe we should go up and ask her what she was thinking?
No that would be really rude.
I don't mean just coming out and asking, I mean like saying hey I like your shoes and skirt and see what she says.
You mean like hoping she will talk about why she was wearing that combination or something like that?
Yeah, plus it will be an ice breaker and maybe we can ask her about it more.
Yeah good point, maybe she will explain why she was wearing it and then it would make sense.
Yeah, plus I liked her shoes.  I think they were Lou Vitton's.
Yeah they were nice, just not with that skirt.
I mean her clothes are generally really pretty, but the hot pink and dark green combo, just do not work.
Yeah, I think the color choice was extremely poor taste.
Maybe if the skirt was a bluish color it would have brought them all together?
Yeah, but I also think the shoes should have been a neutral or bright color, instead of the dark color.
