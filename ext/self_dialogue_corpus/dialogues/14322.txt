Did you watch the Golden State and San Antonio game last night?
Yes. It was certainly closer than the previous two games.
Who won?
Golden State won. They are now up 3-0 in the series.
What was the score?
120-108. San Antonio actually played closer than the score indicated.
Did Kawahi Leonard play for the Spurs?
No. He has an injured ankle.
First Tony Parker. Now Leonard. I don't see how they can operate.
Ginobli stepped up last night. Johnathon Simmons had a good game as well. Aldridge just hasn't been himself in the series.
I believe that Golden State will sweep.
Certainly looks like it. The injuries and lack of consistency are hurting the Spurs.
It looks like it will be a rematch between Golden State and Cleveland in the Finals.
Third year in a row. The rubber match can settle the score for sure.
When does Cleveland play again?
They play today at home.
What is the score in that series?
Cleveland is up 2-0 over Boston. They have been dominating just like Golden State has.
I wonder if any two Finals teams have ever entered the series with undefeated playoff records?
It has never been done. If it happens this year it would be the first time in history.
