Who is the better villian, Darth Vader or Kylo Ren?
Oh, Darth Vader.  Can't even compare yet. 6 movies versus 1.
True, but I think he has potential.
He did kill his father.
But, I didn't like him being all emotional.
Well, it's a bit more realistic.
I guess. I hope that he isn't that one girl's brother.
No, I think she's his cousin.
I hope Rey is related to Obi-Wan instead of Luke and Leia.
I like that idea!
