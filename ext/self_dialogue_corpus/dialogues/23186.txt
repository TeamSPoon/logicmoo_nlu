I love the actors in this movie.
I really love Jennifer Jason Leigh
Yeah she is great.
She makes really great movies.
What your favorite movie by her.
Single white female was a good one
Oh yeah, that was good.
Which of her movies do you like?
I liked Miami Blues
I did not really like that movie
Really, why?
Alec Baldwin is just not my cup of tea.
Haha, that is funny.
It's true though
So he messed up the movie for you?
He sure did.
I don't mind Alec Baldwin
I cannot stand him
Wow, that seems deep.
Well, what can I say.
