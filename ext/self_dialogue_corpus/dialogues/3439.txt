What is the scariest movie that you've ever watched?
The Exorcist.
Wow. I saw the original one & it was terrifying.
Extremely terrifying. What about you?
The Amityville Horror.
I haven't seen that.
It have me nightmares the night that I watched it!
Goodness, it was that scary?
Well to me it was, but I'm a scary cat.
So am I, so I would probably have nightmares about it too. I had them after watching Exorcist.
