A New Hope or Empire Strikes Back?
They're both great, that's like asking me to pick my favorite child.
Well if you absolutely had to choose one, which of those is better?
Okay I would say Empire Strikes Back is the better of the two but they're both excellent.
Why do you prefer Empire Strikes Back over A New Hope?
Well, there's just so many memorable scenes. There are also a lot of beloved characters that make their debut in Episode Five.
What new characters from Empire Strikes back did you like?
Well you have to go with the introduction of Yoda obviously. When Luke travels to Dagobah to find Yoda, that's an extremely entertaining part of the movie.
It was fun seeing Luke expecting to find what he thought a powerful Jedi would be only to discover that this small little creature was actually him.
Yeah Yoda was hilarious. Also, the actual puppet used for Yoda looked really good, much better than the CGI versions of Yoda in later movies.
