The Usual Suspects is one of my favorite movies have you seen it?
I have, but I did not love it.
How could you not?
I had it figured out the first 5 minutes. So no mystery in it or joy ride finding out.
Ah man, that kind of sucks, but it still a great film.
It is good but not that great to me.
I still like to watch it even knowing all the spoilers, I think the performances are masterful.
Kevin spacey is good, but I saw right through him.
Interesting fact. Soze is Turkish for "talks too much".
That is kind of funny. I like that. Thanks for sharing.
