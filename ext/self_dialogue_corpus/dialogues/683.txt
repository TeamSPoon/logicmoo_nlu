Did you hear the Saints signed Adrian Peterson this morning?
Dude yes!! Like holy cow, I would have never expected AP to be Saint.
It's insane. From the looks of it he seems like he is very healthy rite now.
Yeah I know and the Saints aquired him for cheap too.
How much was his contract for?
It's a 2 year $7 millon dollar deal.
Did the Saints give him a signing bonus too
Yup. AP is going to get a $2.5 millon signing bonus.
The Saints actually made a decent deal for once.
I literally was thinking the same thing when the news broke!
Seems like Mark Ingram is going to have stiff competiton this season.
I'm not entirely sure what role Adrian Peterson is going to have in the backfield, the Saints are already stacked.
Yeah I'm guessing Sean Payton is going to use AP in a smiliar role to like what Darren Sproles was.
Our offense is going to be unstoppable if that's the case.
Reminds me a lot of the 2009 Saints team.
Ah I wouldn't go that far, we still don't have a defense.
True but a very good offense like ours can pick up the slack left by defense.
I guess. But turnovers are always a huge problem for us.
Yeah I feel like we could have won way more games last season if it wasn't for turnovers.
My point exactly. You can't win games like if you're turning over the ball like we did.
