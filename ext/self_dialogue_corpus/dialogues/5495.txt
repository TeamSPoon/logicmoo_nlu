Did you see the new beauty and the beast movie?
Yes, the live action version?
Yep, it was awesome wasn't it?
I loved the girl who played belle, she did a great job!
The beast was a bit odd though wasn't he?
Yes! He kind of creeped me out.
How about Gaston?!
Oh he was dreamy, and The guy who played LeFou was very entertaining!
Did you know that he was the guy who played olaf in frozen?
He did?? I guess I can see that now!
