Did you like the original Beauty and the Beast or the live-action version better?
I haven't seen the live-action version, so I like the original best.
I like both of them a lot, but I agree, the original is my favorite.
I love all of the characters in it, especially Lumiere and Cogsworth.
I think that Gaston and LeFou are pretty funny, too, even if Gaston is a little scary.
Belle definitely didn't belong with someone as bad as Gaston, even if he was entertaining!
Gaston never would have fought off wolves for her like Beast did.
I was so worried that Beast would get killed when he was fighting the wolves!
I was even more worried when he fought Gaston at the end.
I am so glad Beast was okay, he ended up being a good guy after all.
