Are you into Lady Gaga's music?
Yes sometimes.
What songs have you heard recently?
I heard Beautiful, Dirty, Rich.
I like that song but it is kind of catty in my opinion.
Yeah I can always imagine that being the theme to mean girls or something.
Very true.
I like the song Telephone.
That song will never get old.
Totally agree.
