Ghibli movies always have the best soundtracks.
I know. The one from Totoro gets stuck in my head all the time.
I read recently that it's just one guy, Joe Hisaishi, who does the soundtracks for most of them.
Really? Does he have any other music?
It seems like he's done a few other things. Lots of movies.
That doesn't surprise me.
His songs have a way of really transporting you to a place that feels far away and fantastical.
It's so great when a movie can actually do that. The music is very important.
Yeah. I found a group called Grand Gallery Japan that was covering some of his songs, and I got interested in them too.
What did they change?
It was all piano and strings. I think they put it in a minor key too, to make it sound sadder.
Why do you think they would do that?
Well, the album was called "Melancholy Piano and Strings," so I'm guessing that had something to do with it.
Was there anything else good on the album?
A few songs! It introduced me to a few artists I like now.
Like who?
Well, there's DJ Okawari, who also makes very place-based ambient songs.
That sounds interesting.
There are lyrics though.
Lend me the album sometime!
