What is so good about it?
It shows the story of three servicemen returning from the war.

Dana Andrews, Myrna Loy, and a guy named Harold Russell, among others. Harold Russell is interesting?
What is interesting about him?
He wasn't really an actor. He was a serviceman who lost both arms from the elbow down.
Wow.

Cool
But he went ahead and won supporting actor becoming the only person to win two Oscars for the same performance.
That is great. I think I want to see that move.
