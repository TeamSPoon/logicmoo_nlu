I watched Monsters University finally!
It took you long enough!
I think it was even better than the first one! Mike as a child was so cute!
Oh I know, he was the cutest little monster. I loved seeing younger Sulley too!
His hair was so great in it!
Yes, and Randall with his glasses!
I did like all the games, but I have to say I really did miss Boo.
Boo was a great character and it was sad not to see her!
I think it was interesting they went to the past for the sequel instead of the future.
Yeah, but this prequel gave us such new information!
