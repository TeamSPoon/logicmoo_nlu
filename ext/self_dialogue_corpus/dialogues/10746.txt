Do you ever watch the Fast and Furious movies?
Only every year, or when I want to be surrounded by awesomeness.
True, what do you think of Letty?
You mean Michelle Rodriguez?
Yes, I always wish she had more stunts in the movies.
I know just what you mean, but that fit scene in the dress was epic.
Totally amazing, who played that girl though? Wasn't it some UFC chick or something?
It was Ronda Rousey man, you know, the Champion UFC chick.
Whoa really, that just makes it even cooler.
No what makes it cooler is I just got the full series on blue-ray, do you feel the need?
