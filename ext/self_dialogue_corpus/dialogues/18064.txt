Do you know who Halsey is?
Kind of. She's from the Chainsmokers, right?
No, she's not part of the Chainsmokers, she was just featured on one of their popular songs.
Oh, okay. That song was so overplayed.
I know, but you should check out her own music.
Oh yeah? Like what?
Well, her first album Badlands is really good.
What's her genre would you say?
I'm not sure. Maybe a blend of pop and alternative and electronic.
Okay, sounds cool.
Her new album, Hopeless Fountain Kingdom, is great too.
Is it similar to her first?
Kind of, they're both concept records.
What does that mean?
It means all the songs sort of go together and tell a story.
Oh, that's really cool.
Yeah, her new one is based off Romeo and Juliet.
Huh, that's definitely unique.
Yeah, you should definitely give it a listen all the way through.
Okay, I will!
