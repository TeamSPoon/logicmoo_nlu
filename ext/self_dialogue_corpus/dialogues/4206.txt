Favorite Liam Neeson film?
I'd say Taken
Yea, I'd agree.
I liked the first one, but the second was kinda bad.
I try to ignore that sequel.
The first one had so many good one liners
The fan reactions to that movie were pretty good!
I hope one day, he and jason bourne team up.
That would be an epic movie
Fighting spies and saving kidnapped women, what else do you need in a movie?
