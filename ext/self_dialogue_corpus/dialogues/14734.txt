Have you ever seen Ghostbusters?
Yeah, with Bill Murray. I love that movie.
I love all the actors in that movie.
Like Dan Akroid? He was too funny.
I like the part when Dan Akroid gets slimed by the fat ghost in the hallway.
I like that little funny guy who says he is the key master or the gatekeeper or whatever.
That dudes hilarious, how he thinks his apartment door is locked because hes pulling instead of pushing it.
And the ending is funny with the huge statepuff marshmellow man.
When they were facing that demon on top of the building?
Yep, and they had to fight the first thing they could think of.
