What is the last movie you saw in the theatre?
Snatched. It is a comedy.
Who plays in that movie?
Goldie Hawn and Amy Schumer are the main actresses.
Oh I like both of them! Was it good?
Yea. The movie had some parts that were a little far-fetched but overall it was a good movie.
Good! The last movie I saw was All Roads Lead to Rome with Sarah Jessica Parker.
What is that about?
It is about an American woman who takes her daughter on a trip to Italy.
Sounds like an interesting movie.
It was very good. The movie showed many parts of Italy so it was neat to see that.
I do like Sarah Jessica Parker. She was great in Failure to Launch.
Another comedy. You must really like comedies.
I love movies that are funny! How about you? What is your favorite comedy?
I like the movie The Hangover.
That is a great choice! That movie is hilarious!
Yea I love Allen, he cracks me up!
He is hilarious in that movie.
I always cringe when the dentist pulls out his own tooth!
Me too! I hate that part.
