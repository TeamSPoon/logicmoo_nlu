I think Cars 3 is coming out this weekend or next.
Are you going to see it? Cars is my least favorite Pixar movie ever.
I'd say Cars 2 is worse than Cars, but yeah, it's definitely on their low end of the quality scale.
This one seems to be getting better reviews, though.
True, but with how good Toy Story 2 and 3 were, you'd think they would be better at sequels.
Agreed. Monsters University wasn't the best film either.
I have strong faith in The Incredibles 2, though -- there's no way they can mess that up.
Especially with the current trend of superhero films.
So, we're skipping Cars 3 and waiting for the next Pixar movie?
Sounds good to me.
