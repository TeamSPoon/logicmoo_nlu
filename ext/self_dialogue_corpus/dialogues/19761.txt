So I've been trying to decide which Howard is better: the first name, or the last name.
What are you talking about?
So there's Howard Shore, and there's James Newton Howard. Who's better?
Aren't they soundtrack composers?
Yeah, they're both quite famous, and I like them both a lot.
Shore did Lord of the Rings, right?
Yep! All three of the first, and the Hobbit films as well.
Oh, then I don't see how anyone else could be a winner. He's a genius.
He did make probably the most iconic soundtrack of all time.
I could listen to the shire theme all day.
At the same time, though, that's pretty much the only thing he's famous for.
I guess that's true; I can't name anything else he's done.
Howard last name, in the meantime, has done everything from The Dark Knight to Space Jam.
Wait, what?
Weird, right? He also did the Hunger Games music.
Oh, I love those themes. Mockingjay has such a great combination of all the leitmofs.
Exactly, and his work with Zimmer in The Dark Knight is just phenomenal.
I see the conundrum.
I guess I'd go with Howard Shore in the end, because I love Lord of the Rings so much.
Nah, man, I'm going with James. Variety all the way.
