I've been watching Chasing Amy too much. I can't get the Star Wars scene out of my mind.
Ha.  Darth Vader, Nubian God.
Obviously, that makes Luke mixed race.
It would have been cool if they had James Earl Jones in that armor.
Oh, yes.  Certainly.
We wouldn't have had to endure Hayden Christensen's acting, either.
Don't knock Hayden.  He's done some good work.  I just don't think he was ready for something like Star Wars.  And I think Lucas's directing wasn't the best.
Lucas should have gotten Spielberg to do it.
He tried, from what I understand. Spielberg convinced him to do it.
That was a mistake.
