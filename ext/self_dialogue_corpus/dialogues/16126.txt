Have you heard about the music festival coming to Pennsylvania?
What? A music festival in Pennsylvania? Is it in Philly or Pittsburgh?
No, it is actually in central PA.
Are you serious? It must all be really small artists.
You'd think so, but actually John Legend is the headliner.
No way! Anyone else I'd know?
Chance the Rapper will be there, and so will Paramore, Alessia Cara, and a bunch of alternative bands.
That's amazing. That would be cool to see.
It defintely would. I think they are even going to have Grace Vanderwaal.
Who is that?
She's that young girl that played the ukelele and won America's Got Talent last year.
Oh, I remember her. She is a great musician.
She really is. Her voice is sort of that alternative, folk sound that has become more common.
I know. It took me awhile to get used to that. I didn't like it at first.
You do now though?
For the most part. I guess that style has grown on me.
Anyone in particular that you like?
Well, of that style, I like Of Monsters and Men. Their lead female singer really has that sound.
Did you know they are from Iceland?
No, that's interesting. You don't hear that often.
