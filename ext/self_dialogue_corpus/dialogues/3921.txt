You know what was a classic movie?  Jurassic Park.
I agree, it totally changed the summer blockbuster.
Yes, the raptors were pretty cool.
The special effects were all together.  Plus a pretty solid plot line.
I agree, I was a young pre-teen boy at the time.  So I remember the triple Jurassic burger from MacDonald's or Burger King.
Yeah I do too.  That was before they had triples all the time.
You know what else was cool in that movie?  In the beginning when they were digging up those bones.
Yeah, it was like the calm before the storm.
A good funny part of the movie though.  When that girl was going nuts over the extinct plant.
Yeah, and she didn't see the dinosaur behind her.
