What movie are you most excited to see this summer?
I am looking forward to the new tom cruise mummy film.
I saw a trailer it seems okay. I am more excited for the sequel to his edge of tomorrow. Have you seen it?
No, I don't think so. what is it about?
It is kind of like a groundhog's day concept. He keeps reliving a day.
I love ground hog's day the movie...
Well edge of tomorrow is really different just similar in  that concept. But really good, you should watch it.
I will, thanks for the suggestion.
No problem. Another movie with the reliving the same day theme is the movie Before I fall.
I heard of that , based on a book correct?
Yes, that is the one. I have not seen it yet, but plan to watch this weekend.
I think it will be decent. But don't really know any of the actors.
You know what was great with some more or less unknowns... get out.
Yes, i saw it so good. Really different and compelling.
Ya it had me on the edge of my seat. Also pretty funny at times too.
Ya kind of rare to have funny moments in horror.
I like cabin in the woods and that is a really funny horror movie.
Agreed, very original. I think that was a great movie.
Me too, but feel a lot of people over looked it.
Ya sometimes hard to know what is going to be worth watching.
