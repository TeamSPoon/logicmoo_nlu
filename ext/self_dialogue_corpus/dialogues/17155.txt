How has your day been going so far?
It has been kind of slow up until this point. I am getting ready to put on some music.
What kind of music do you normally listen to?
I like a little bit of everything to be honest.
That is how I am as well. Have you heard Bruno Mars' new song?
I am not sure, what is it called?
The name of it is That's What I like. I think it is an awesome song.
Yes I have heard that one quite recently actually. I like it as well!
I normally do not care for a lot of new music; but here lately there have been some good songs released.
I know what you mean! Have you heard Shape Of You yet?
Yes! Is that the one by Ed Sheeran?
It sure is! I love a lot of his music.
Yea he has a very good voice and seems to be on his way to the top.
I also like Future, what about you?
Normally I am not that big of a fan, although I do like his new song Mask Off.
Yea that is a really good song, I just got done listening to it actually.
Do you like any country music?
Some of it is pretty good, is there anything new out?
Yes, Sam Hunt has a new song called Body Like A Back Road.
I love that song! I heard it for the first time the other day.
