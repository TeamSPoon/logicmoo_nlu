Did you hear that Allie X finally released Collxtion II?
She did? Wow, it's been so long!
I know. I've been waiting for it to come out since forever.
Did any cuts from the mixtape make it on?
Yeah, she put on That's So Us, thankfully.
That was one of my favorites, too.
She actually also worked with Troye Sivan on his album.
Did she really? I didn't hear that.
Yeah, and I think he might have written on Allie X's album, too.
I can see that being a really interesting pairing.
