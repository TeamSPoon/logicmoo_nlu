Do you think the Patriots will win the SUperbowl again this year.
No I think someone else will get it.
WHo do you think.
I think maybe the falcons or the cowboys.
I think the cowboys could be in the championship.
I agree or the Steelers.
What about the Giants?
Maybe
The Seahawks maybe.
If they got new players then yes.
I think it may surprise us.
I hope so.
NFL needs a new team a fresh face to get up there.
I would like to see the Browns do better/
Me too.
It would amaze alot of people.
I agree they only won one or two last season.
YEah I think they should do better.
The Bengals could go far.
They are a good team.
