What are some of the best NFL video games of all time?
I haven't played any of the recent video games, so my list contains older games.
Like Tecmo Bowl?
Well, Tecmo Super Bowl. That was the first video game with real players and you could choose any team.
Tecmo Super Bowl was great. I loved how it kept stats and you could play a full season.
I remember playing full seasons in one night.
What were some players in that game. That came out in the early 1990's, right?
I believe it was 1991. I remember running backs like Thurman Thomas, Barry Sanders, and Marcus Allen.
Was Bo Jackson unstoppable in that game?
I believe that was regular Tecmo Bowl. He was like a hundred times better than any other player.
I remember some of the Quarterbacks on that game. Warren Moon, Randall Cunningham, Joe Montana.
I loved playing as the Houston Oilers. They had the run and shoot offense.
The run and shoot. That was totally a nineties thing.
They had great receivers and I would just play the entire game throwing bombs down the field.
Houston definitely was good on that game. I always liked playing as the Bills. They had so many offensive weapons.
They were good as well. They had a great defense, if you could even play defense in that game.
What other NFL video games come to mind.
Of course the first Madden games.
Madden definitely was fun back then.
It was the first game that came out where you could actually play defense and the scores were realistic.
