George Harrison is the best Beatle?
do you really think so?
i do!
why? tell me your reasoning
he was the guitarist! way better than john, too.
you're right! john's parts were really quite simple
he has a beautiful voice, and don't you love listening to his guitar gently weep?
i do!
exactly. his solos were great, his voice was great, his songs were great
too bad we had to lose him...
