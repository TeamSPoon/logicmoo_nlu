Jar-Jar always gets a bad rep with fans.
I love him, he's funny.
I do too, he's the only reason they got off the planet.
No one takes the time to acknowledge his role in events.
He is second only to Yoda in parody voice.
Too far you have gone.
So saysa yousa betcha betcha.
Ok I'll give you that one.
I'd rather see a movie showing his background more than Hon Solo.
That is definitely too far. Hon Solo is awesome and a core character, he earned his own story.
