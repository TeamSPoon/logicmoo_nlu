So how much or little did you like the prequels?
I really liked all three. The phantom menace got alot of bad reviews though.
I agree I really liked all three.
I might've not gone with Hayden Christianson in Attack of the clones but the movie was great.
Yeah, I'm not a big fan of Christianson either.
My other critique is way too much CG.
Exactly! Yoda was different each movie.
They should have used the same puppet for Yoda that they used in Empire Strikes back.
True. They just used too many computer generated characters which made the movie feel fake.
Well that's the times we live in. Maybe the Last Jedi will be better?
