You know, people mock Lucas for turning Star Wars into a cash cow, but the truth is I loved playing with the characters when I was little.
Oh yeah? You had the action figures?
Yeah, pretty much all of them. I could name all of the jedi characters.
Who was your favourite?
Adi Gallia, a Tholothian. She was a general in the jedi army.
Did she ever show up in the movies?
Yeah, in a few scenes. She's in the jedi council when Anakin auditions, and then she's in the Revenge of the Sith.
Cool, it must have been great to see her on the big screen!
Well, not in the third movie. She shows up in Order 66. I got to watch her die.
Wow, I bet that made that scene so much more powerful; that's rough.
