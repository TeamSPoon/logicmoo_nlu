So i was watching this movie called Lucy last week.
How was it?
Good. It was cool science fiction.
What was it about?
This girl studying in Asia, her sleasy boyfriend was a drug mule and he strong-armed her to do the next run.
Interesting, tell me more.
Well, this drug was a brain enhansing drug but only to be taken in small doses.
Let me guess, she got dosed.
Yes. Heavily.
Hm, i guess this is where the story takes off.
Yes, her use of her brain exceeds 10% and increases as the movie continues.
What happens then?
Well, her brain starts to develop powers. She can see cell calls, the internet, move things with her mind.
Very cool. Then what?
Well, she reached out to a famous brain scientist to see where she was going to end up at.
Who stared in this?
Scarlet Johansen was Lucy and Morgan Freeman was the Brain Doctor. Everyone else was foreign actors.
Right on! Is it something i should get?
I would recomend it. It keeps you intrigued for the whole movie.
Cool, i'll check it out this weekend.
