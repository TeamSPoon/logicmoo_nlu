Have you seen the new thriller movie Split?
No, I wanted to, buy haven't yet.  Any good?
James Mccavoy is awesome in it.
The previews looked really good.
He was very convening as each character.
I heard it ties in with Unbreakable.
It does, it is a continuation that connects at the end.
Was Bruce Willis in this?
no, but will be in the next one.
I will have to go rent it today.
