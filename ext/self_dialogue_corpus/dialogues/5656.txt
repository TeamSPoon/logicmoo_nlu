Which is better, Atlantis or Treasure Planet?
Oh, Atlantis for sure.
I have to disagree. I much preferred Treasure Planet.
Atlantis was so much cooler! They had all the technology.
They had technology on Treasure planet. So much tech.
But Atlantis had the cool blue glow, and the folklore.
The characters were much more likeable in Treasure Planet.
There were evil characters in both movies you can't base it off of that.
Treasure planet is still my favorite.
You can think that, but Atlantis is better.
