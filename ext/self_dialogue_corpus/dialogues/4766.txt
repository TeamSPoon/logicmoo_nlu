Do you think the Cubs repeat this year?
They are having a tough time even staying near 500!
I know but its a long season and wait til it warms up
Joe Maddon usually gets his teams hot when they need to be
He is probably one of the best managers in baseball.
If not the best.
What about the Rangers?
What about them?
Do you think they can go far?
They do this every year.
Have strong regular seasons?
Yeah and then they fumble it come October.
At some point the breaks even out.
Yeah I just think they lack the pitching depth.
Hamels being out is going to hurt them.
Yeah and I dont trust Darvish.
Think he will get hurt?
No just dont know if he has big game moxie
Thats interesting for a take
I know but its a fact as well
