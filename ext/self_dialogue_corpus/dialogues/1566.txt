Damon Harrison is so funny. Did you hear what he said on Good Morning America?
No  what did he do?
It's not what he did, its what he said.
Well, What did he say?
He made a comparison to Eli Manning and Lebron James.
Are you kidding me? In what context?
He said when you look at Eli Manning, it's like how you look at Lebron James.
That is funny.
I guess he is saying that Eli Manning is the Lebron James of the NFL.
(Laugher) I can see how he can look at things like that.
Lebron James is the superstar of the NBA.
Just like Eli Manning the the superstar of the NFL.
Both are really great players at their sport for sure.
That is the truth.
Eli has definetly had a good few years for awhile now.
Something definetly changed from 2013.
Yeah he did not have a good year back then.
He sure did turn things around.
That was a huge complement that Damon Harrison gave Eli Manning.
Yeah and Lebron James too!!
