Did you ever see Phone Booth?
Yes. It was so suspenseful.
I was wondering the whole time who the killer was.
I had no idea how it was going to end.
Yes. Every scene has you sat the edge of your seat.
What is another thriller you like?
Any Hitchcock movie really.
Like what?
The Birds and Psycho are both great thrillers.
I will have to see those.
