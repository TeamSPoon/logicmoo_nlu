Hey! do you think Brett Favre is a good influence for Aaron Rodgers?
Definitely, Brett is a great mentor for Aaron Rodgers.
You think so? I really doubt that, since they have different style of play.
Probably, but Brett Favre is one of the few remaining veterans that are still in the league.
What if Aaron Rodgers does not need Brett Favre, do you think he's too old to be mentoring in the league right now?
I think Aaron needs some of the ropes that Brett Favre can bring and offer, and no, Favre is one of the few veterans that are still relevant.
I still think that the pairing is a bit flawed because of their individual style of play.
It's true but I think they can adjust pretty well.
Although, Favre is a champion though so I guess that would very much help in a sense.
Greatly, but so is Rodgers, you would need a mentor who is already a champion, not just a player who have been in the league for quite a while.
How about this, if things would workout, would they (Packers) have a chance in the superbowl?
Definitely, since this past season they did great.
Really? I think they have underperformed.
I disagree, I think the Packers were only a bit unlucky in most of their games.
Well if you put it that way, they don't deserve to be in the Superbowl if luck is their concern.
I'm just saying that they were games last season that they had a great chance of winning, yet they came up short.
I somewhat agree, that's where Favre needs to focus on mentoring Aaron Rodgers.
Right, he should be more mental instead of changing how Aaron plays.
Agree, I really hope Aaron Rodgers would click with Brett Favre and win the Superbowl again.
I would really think so and there is a great chance they can do it, let's just be patient.
