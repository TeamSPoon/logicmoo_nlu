Who is your favorite singer of all time?
Definitely Michael Jackon
He's a tough one to beat!
Who even comes close?
Maybe Celine Dion or Andrea Bocelli, they are very famous!
I think Andrea Bocelli is great too, but he's not as popular with young kids
Yeah, every generation likes to hear MJ sing though
and that's why he's the best of all time!
When we think of the best musicians people never think of rap
They say it isn't music!
Yeah, but not everyone can just write a good rap.
Maybe they can write like Lil Wayne does though
But not like Eminem, he rhymes to fast and can freestyle too
I tried to write a song but it wasnt good at all. It's very embarassing
What's your favorite song from Eminem?
I like Till I Collapse
That's my second favorite song!
Wait, what's your favorite?
I like Rap God, he talks about why he's the best rapper of all time
He's a little cocky but he is allowed to do that if he's that good!
