You can put a cd in the cd player while we're driving if you want.
What do you like to listen to?
I have mostly rock cds. There's some good driving music in there.
Oh boy, I see some- Beastie Boys!
That's really good driving music- like No Sleep Till Brooklyn.
First we gotta play Brass Monkey, I LOVE that song!
Everybody loves that song! That, and You Gotta Fight For Your Right To Party.
OH, and Girls- that song cracks me up.
I know, it's so sexist, but it's so funny I just giggle through the whole thing.
This is going to be a fun ride singing Beastie Boy songs!
