what do you think of the lumineers?
I don't know who they are.
They're an alternative band, i'm sure you've heard their song ophelia.
Oh yeah I've heard that, I thought it sounded really rustic.
What do you think about them, do you like them?
They're ok but not really my speed.
What don't you like about them?
I think they sound a bit too farm barn esque, if you know what I mean.
Not really, I thought their sound was genuine and original
they sound like mumford and sons and that's not very unique is it?
I think they do a lot to make music sound good, and their lyrics are nice.
I guess if that's the kind of music you like to listen to.
They have a girl singer too, what do you thinka bout that?
I think she should sing more often because I don't like the guys voice very mich
well, he's the lead singer. They're playing in our city, and I wanted to go. do you want to go with e?
I guess i could go with you, who else is playing?
mumford and sons and kings of leon
wow that's quite the lineup, ya know, maybe I would like to listen to them.
Okay well, this may be a fun experience!
yeah ok, i'll give it a shot
