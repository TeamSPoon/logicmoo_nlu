What do you think has been the most outrageous fashion statement in popular culture?
Lady Gaga's meat dress was pretty ridiculous.
True, but she was trying too hard with that one.
Remember J-Lo's double sided tape dress holding up her boobs in the late 90s?
Yeah, funny how people made a big deal of it at the time.
Same with Madonna and her cone-shaped bra back in the day.
It seems like you don't see as many fashion statements by men that resonate so deeply with the public.
Well, Dennis Rodman sort of did in his time.
Sure, but part of it was dressing up in women's clothes, like the wedding dress publicity stunt.
Justin Bieber started a trend of wearing pants that looked like they had a diaper in them, right?
Don't remind me.
What are some fashion trends that you can't stand right now?
Skinny jeans - I'm all for clothes that have a tailored fit, but some of those jeans are too tight.
Sure, but depending on the person wearing them, they can be attractive.
True, but not the general wearer.
Another one for me is torn pants. It seems like they come and go, but never look good.
There are some things that you should only wear if you are a performer, I suppose.
I've never been a fan of v-neck sweaters.
Agreed, there is something strange about them. Maybe if you wear a tie underneath them.
I suppose that could be okay.
