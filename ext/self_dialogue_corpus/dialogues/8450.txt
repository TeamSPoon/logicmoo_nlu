Who's your favorite singer right now?
Hmmm... I'd say I really like Adele.
Oooo. I like her, too.
She's got a great voice and seems so down to earth.
I like her because her songs from the first album are still relevant.
Absolutely.  I'd listen to the first album anytime.
I wonder when she'll have her next album come out.
Not sure.  I haven't heard anything about it.
Well, I would be excited to hear it.
Me, too.  We'll be Rollin' in the Deep while we wait!
