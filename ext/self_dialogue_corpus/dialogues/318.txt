Did you get to see the Ant-Man?
Yeah, i was surprised by how good it actually was!
I know, Paul Rudd did a great job with bringing the character to life on the big screen.
He was an excellent choice for the roll.
What did you think of Evangeline Lilly's role?
She is going to take up the mantle of the Wasp so that is something to look forward to.
Absolutely, i think she will be the success behind the next movie.
It is going to be epic seeing Ant-Man and the Wasp teaming up together.
Maybe if we are lucky they will have another Marvel character make an appearance in the next Ant-Man movie as well.
Right, like they did with Falcon in the last one.
