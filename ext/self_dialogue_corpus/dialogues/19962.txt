What do you think of satillite radio?
I love it. It's nice to have commercial free music and the variety is good.
I love the covers channel and the one hit wonders one.
Those are good but I'm more of a country fan.
Do you listen to the classic country or the newer stuff?
Mostly classic.
I can't get into that but to each their own. That's what's good about satillite radio: there's something for everyone.
That's true. My husband likes rock and I like country and we are both happy with the selection.
Are there ny channels you'd like to see them create?
Definitely an Irish channel with pub rock and folk type music.
Oh, that would be awesome.
How about you?
Maybe a channel playing story songs?
Those are everywhere in country.
Yes, I know, and those are songs I can stand. Most country is too whiny, though.
I don't think so.
How about George Jones?
He can be. So can a few other artists but the songs are at least true to life. People really are whiny sometimes.
Yes, they are. I like happier music, though.
I'll introduce you to some good story songs soon.
