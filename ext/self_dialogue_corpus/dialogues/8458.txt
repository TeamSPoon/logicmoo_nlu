I heard a funny story about Justin Bieber.
That wouldn't be surprising, there's probably LOTS of those!
He was singing at a festival a couple weeks ago and someone asked him to sing the Spanish song he collaborated on, Despacito.
What was he doing, lip synching?
No, he couldn't even do that. He refused to sing it, and admitted to the crowd he didn't even know the lyrics.
That would be funny!
One of the fans apparently didn't think so- they threw a water bottle and almost hit him in the head.
Did he get mad and storm off the stage?
No, he was actually calm and asked them not to throw things at him.
I kind of feel for him, because I took Spanish in school, and I couldn't learn much except a few words.
