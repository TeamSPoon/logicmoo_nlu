Has anyone seen the new Transformers movie yet?
No I didn't, who was playing this weekend?
Well Crrossroads and also Regal is playing it.
What is the story line on this one?
Humans are at war with the Transformers, and Optimus Prime is gone. The key to saving the future lies buried in the secrets of the past and the hidden history of Transformers on Earth
I hope Mark Wahlburg is playing in this one, he was great in the last movie.
Yes, he is coming back, and Josh Duhamel plays beside him in this with Anthony Hopkins too!
I am so going to see that on the big screen!
Yes, I think its the only real way to see an action movie like this.
To do it justice, yes it is!
