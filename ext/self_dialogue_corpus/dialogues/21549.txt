Have you seen any great movies this year?
Yes, a few. My favorite so far has been Beauty and the Beast.
I have not seen that. I loved the animated version and was worried I would not love it as much.
I loved the animation too, believe me you will not be disappointed.
I am glad to hear that. I hate when they rain on your memories.
The actors and effects are amazing. You will fall in love with the Beast.
Yeah, I heard it was the actor from Downtown Abbey. I just couldn't see it.
Oh you must, trust me, your heart will soar. If you loved the animation you will fall in love with this too.
If you say so. Is the music all the same?
Pretty much, they did add a few new tunes. It is very well done.
I will give it try. I have been looking forward to Tom Cruise in The Mummy.
I heard that was not very good. I love Tom Cruise but will hold off for DVD on that one.
Yeah, I do not want to go and be disappointed. The trailer looked great.
I agree, but so many people have said they didn't care for it. I don't want to spend the money on a ticket.
Me too. I would rather pay to see Wonder Woman twice.
That's funny. I paid to see Beauty and the Beast three times.
You did. I guess it is good.
It is in my top ten of all time. Maybe even in the top five.
Really, the animation was one of my top ten. I will go this week, I promise.
Do you want company? I would definitely see it again.
