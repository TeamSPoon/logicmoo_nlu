Hey are you a big fan of Reggae?
I guess so.
You don't sound very excited about the question.
It's not that dislike Reggae, it just seems like its essentially one artist and it gets its own category.
Which artist?
Obviously Bob Marley.
What's the problem with that?
Well, what other genre is like that?
I dont know, but I think you're going to tell me.
Classic music has Beethoven, Mozart, Bach
Ok.
Rock has Led Zepplin, Metallica, Green Day.
I think I understand.
Reggae is probably the only music genre that is widely known for one person.
Come on, there are thousands of Reggae artists.
Name two not named Marley.
So I can't say Ziggy Marley?
No you can't.
I can't think of any.
My point exactly.
