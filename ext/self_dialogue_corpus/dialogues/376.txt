So I'm thinking Jared Leto is the best Joker yet.
I'll pretend I didn't hear you say that.
Let me guess: you think Heath Ledger was.
Me and the rest of the world thinks that.
Leto was much crazier and dangerous than Ledger ever was.
Jack Nicholson was a better Joker than Leto.  So overrated.
Didn't you hear him do the laugh in the movie?  Those other Jokers couldn't do that.
They didn't need to as their performances were creepy enough.
They should make a movie with all three Jokers in it!
You just blew my mind.
