I was watching some videos of Rick Springfields latest concert.
Wow, I used to love him.
Well, you still can. He looks the same.
I loved his music too.
Working Class Dog was a great album.
It was. I still have the LP.
Do you really? Might be worth money.
I won't sell my albums. They are part of my past.
Jessie's Girl was such a big hit.
People still sing that song when they hear it.
He is 67 years old.
He was also on General Hospital.
I know, but he never sang on the show.
Nope, he was Dr. Noah Drake.
Funny, you remember his characters name.
Success Hasn't Spoiled Me Yet was another great album.
It was. Do you have that too?
Yes, I do.
You are a die hard fan.
Yes, Rick the Stick as they call him.
