Who do you think writes the best lyrics?
Living or Dead?
Both.
Wow, that's a tough one. There are so many different styles, and it's hard to compare them.
True, but you could think about whose lyrics have the greatest effect on you.
I still think it's really hard. For example, sometimes Kurt Cobain makes me feel so dedicated and strong - if I'm in the mood for Nirvana. But, no way I could argue his lyrics are better than Paul Simon's.
So should I mark you down for picking Paul Simon?
No, I love him, but I can't say he is hands down my favorite. But he's way up there. Who do you like the best?
Bob Dylan, no question.
He's fantastic, but I have to be in the mood for him. I would say he writes the best lyrics for sending your thoughts all over the place.
I guess that's why I like him. But, that doesn't make him your favorite?
It could, but then I'd be putting him above Paul McCartney, Eddie Vedder, Paul Smon, and Ira Gershwin.
Gershwin, really? I guess that's why you asked about living or dead.
Well, him and Cole Porter. But really I like Gershwin better than Porter. Gershwin has a complete felicity with language that I hear in Paul Simon, too.
Really? I have heard of them, but I don't think I ever paid attention to the Gershwin brothers.
I think you might like them. Did you ever see that Woody Allen movie, Manhattan?
Yes.
That was all Gershwin music. I just love the opening sequence with Rhapsody in Blue, an instrumental song, no lyrics, by the way.
I think the whole movie was instrumental.
It was, but most of those songs had lyrics, they just weren't used.
