There will be a lot of people, there people will be rooting for da Bears it will be fun. Just think of all the tasty nachos and hotdogs!
I got my kids and I work.

Yeah, I dunno.
I can tell them about the Bears team.
Okay.
I hope we at least make it to the playoffs this year.
Yes, you would like that, wouldn't you.
Yeah, Bears are the team, we just need a team with the will to win.
Yes, everyone wants to win.
It's like we can't find someone definitive to get our team back to the Superbowl.
Well, yeah not everyone is going to be a Tom Brady at winning.
He only won because he cheats.
Oh, wow okay, never knew that.
It's just frustrating seeing my team lose and not being able to do anything about it.
Yeah, I can't imagine how that feels.
