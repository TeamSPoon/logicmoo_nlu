Alright, here's a question. If you were on a desert island and could only bring one CD, what would you bring?
That's a ridiculous question.
Nope, you have to answer.
I will if you do first.
Easy. White Album by the Beatles.
Alright, that's a good one. But I still can't answer.
Not fair. I just answered it so quickly.
Yeah, but. Admit it. You only listen to Rock.
So what?
So I like way too many Genres. There isn't a single album that has all of that on it.
The White Album has such a crazy spread of styles though. It's got folk, it's got rock-
-Nope, it's all still rock.
Whatever.
No really, I would need a little bit of hip-hop, a little bit of Funk, some R&B.
Oh. Actually yeah... I'd bring Talking Book by Stevie Wonder.
What? You barely to Stevie Wonder.
Actually... I love Superstitious more than any song.
See? Your question was dumb.
I'm not the one who couldn't answer a simple question.
FINE. I would also choose the White Album.
