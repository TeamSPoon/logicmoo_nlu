Have you seen Deadpool?
No, Why's everyone talking about it?
It is a really good movie
What genre is the movie?
It is sort of comedy action
I love that kind of movies
Then you should definitely watch this one.
Who's in it?
Ryan Reynolds most significantly.
He plays Deadpool?
Yes. Then there is the lead villain played by Ed Skrein.
That should be interesting.
Plenty of inappropriate jokes too.
So I can't go watching it with my seven year old?
Definitely could not recommend that.
That's a shame. He reads a lot of Marvel comics.
I'm sure his time will come.  The movie will still be relevant ten years from today.
Does Deadpool die in the movie?
I don't want to spoil it for you., Why don't you go and find out?
Sure, I have some time this weekend.
