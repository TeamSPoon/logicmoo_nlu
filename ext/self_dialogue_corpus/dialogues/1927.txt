what's up with your boy kaepernick?
what you mean?
do you think someone will sign him this season?
i don't know. maybe.
i don't think he ever plays in the league again.
that's because of the dumb stuff that comes out of his mouth.
naw, that's because he's garbage.
man, he led the niners to the super bowl that year.
that was like almost five years ago. he hasn't done anything since.
who'd he get benched for in san fran?
some bum. i don't remember his name.
yeah, the forty-niners are a mess.
and i think they got another new head coach this season.
yeah. chip kelly, one and done.
kelly ain't n f l material.
neither is kaepernick.
i don't think either one of them will be in the league this season.
well i know chip kelly won't. i think he signed up for fox tv or one of them networks.
yeah. he might do that for a season and then head back to coaching.
in the colleges, not the pros.
