I was in church the other day and heard this new Charlie Wilson song
Charlie Wilson is in the church singer
I know he's more of a like slow dance Rnb singer
So was the song any good
Actually was pretty good I wasn't expecting Charlie Wilson to come up with good church song
What's the name of the church song
It's called I'm blessed by Charlie Wilson
Well you know I love gospel song so I'm definitely going to have to check it out
Yeah I love how the choir sung it to it sounds so beautiful
Maybe I should go to your church and hear it sing
That sounds like a good idea how about you come this Sunday
Do you know if they want to sing that song Or Not
You can always stand up and request a song to Be Sung
Oh wow really you can do that at your church
Yeah of course they allow that
Request any song you want as long as it's like gospel right
Well if that's the case you heard the new song that jamsine came out with I love that gospel song
That's not her song I know what you talking about she just singing somebody else's song
Well either way original or nice That Song Is Awesome
Alright well I'ma go to church with you this Sunday and hopefully they can send yours in my song
