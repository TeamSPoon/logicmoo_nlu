I'm starting my fantasy football team soon.
It's not bad enough that you watch it incessantly you also spend every second of free time with that fantasy stuff.
What's wrong with that?
Nothing, I guess. But did you ever notice most football fans look as if they've never done anything physical in their lives other than life a beer glass?
Are you commenting on my physique?
If the shoe fits ... or should I say 'if the pants are tight ...'
Once again, you're mean.
I was just teasing. Lord knows I'm the last person to talk. I just dislike sports.
You don't like them at all?
I'm a fair weather fan. I only have an interest if they are in the play offs.
That is fair weather.
Well, Minnesota fans kind of suck anyway so I fit right in.
Why do you say that?
I recall on Fran Tarkenton's very last game, after years of performing for these people, he made a bad play and these 'fans' booed him off the field.
That's cold blooded.
Sure is. Even as a sports hating little kid I knew they were in the wrong.
Don't you think they've gotten better?
Nope.
You're so cynical.
I'm a realist.
