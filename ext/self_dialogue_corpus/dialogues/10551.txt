Hello, is this Bill Eversteen?
Yes, it is, how may I help you?
Well, I wanted to see if you had a moment to talk about Robocop.
It just so happens I do have a moment to talk about Robocop, but I'd like to talk a bout the sequel, too.
I'm sure that can be arranged.
Then I agree completely.
Great, lets begin.  Do you note a certain aspect of social satire that only Verhooven could interject into an action film?
I absolutely do. This is accurate
Do you think the sequel was able to capture it?
I actaully think they id an alright job of it.
But the human aspect of Robocop is what really grounds it. The question of his existance, his memories, whether Murphy is man or machine, correct?
Yes, Robocop is a much more nuanced film than one would think.
How well do you think the sequel did with the human aspect of the first.
Great question. A lot of people feel that the sequel didn't handle that as well.
Do you feel this sway?
No, I find it pretty obvious that since the first film dealt so heavly with this part, then they wanted to move on rather quickly. But they did address it early on, and in a couple more places throughout the film.
The stuff where Murphy keeps showing up at his wife's house.
after all this is a recurring character in comics with many stories to tell.Yeah they needed to move on
Last question, who wasthe better villan, Kurtwood Smith or Tom Noonan.
Eh, I liked the little kid from the second one. That was pretty cool.
