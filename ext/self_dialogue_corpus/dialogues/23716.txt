Rank the Star Wars movies from best to worst.
Do I include The Clone Wars?
Yes, since it's canon.
Okay: Rogue One, Episode V, Episode VII, Episode III, Episode VI, Episode II, Episode I, The Clone Wars.
WHAT? Blasphemy!
Which part?
Episode V is by far superior to everything.
It's really not. It's one of those that's really good but not so much on subsequent viewings.
So why is Rogue better?
Well, modern technology alone gives it the appeal. It has more unexpected elements like the laser machine gun ... which he reloads!
True, I've never seen a weapon reloaded or even low in the Star Wars movies.
I know you're not done digging into me.
Duh. Why III over VI?
VI is awful and was made to market to kids. The happy ending and teddy bears overthrowing the empire?
Yeah but they're cute!
But teddy bears can't fight. And Luke and Leia JUST met them.
You don't think a bunch of teddy bears can defeat a bunch of AT-ATs?
No, not even in the dense forest setting.
Seriously, why were they there?
No idea. The emperor is an idiot for thinking that was the appropriate response for a jungle battle.
