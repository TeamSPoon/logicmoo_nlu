Did you see Logan?
Yupp. I thought it was great.
Honestly, it was kind of dull to me.
How so? It was action packed.
Yeah, there were some intense scenes, but overall, not nearly as exciting as the X-men movies.
Thats true, but this was really just about logan and some other unknown mutants.
You're right. I guess if there were all the other ones then it would have been much better.
But that would defeat the whole purpose of a Logan movie.
True. What was your favorite part
The farmhouse part where he was staying with the nice family.
Oh my gosh, that was brutal.
I know! I felt so bad for the father!
Right? I wasn't expecting it to be so gory.
Yeah, most Marvel movies aren't big on blood and whatnot.
Did you like the little girl?
Kind of. She was a bit annoying at times with how angry she was.
She was a great character, in my opinion. Her having the claws on her feet was epic.
The scene in the corner store with her was hilarious.
Oh, right! When she was just taking whatever she wanted.
Yeah. Too bad there won't be a sequel
