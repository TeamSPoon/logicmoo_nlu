Have your kids seen Blank Check?
No they have not seen it yet but I have
when I was a kid I thought getting a blank check would be so cool
but when you are an adult you realize how illegal that was!
I know, kids in movies always have some drama
it can be so unrealistic though, his parents would have known!
he also had that female teacher coming over, I think she was a teacher
That part was also crazy, now that I think about it that stuff would never happen
I know, but I think that movie is underrated
it is, it was so fun to imagine what would happen
