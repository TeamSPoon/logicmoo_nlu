What's your all-time favorite movie?
That is so hard. It's much easier to give a list.
But if you had to only name one?
I guess I would go with Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.
I've never seen that.
What? Are you crazy?
I think I heard something about it, but never got around to it.
Have you ever seen Being John Malkovich?
Yeah that's a great one.
It's weird just like that one! They're both written by Charlie Kaufman.
Who is in it again?
It's Kate Winslet and Jim Carey.
I'm not a big fan of Jim Carey.
You have to try it though. Jim Carey's character is the quiet, introverted one.
Really? That's weird.
He does an amazing job with that. You have to see it.
What is it about anyway?
It's about what would happen if there was a way to erase all your memories of a relationship.
That sounds pretty good.
Just give it a try. You won't regret it.
