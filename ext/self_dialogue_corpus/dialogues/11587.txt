Do you remember the song "Revolution?"
The Beatles song?
Yeah, that's it!
Yeah, do you remember in the 90s when there was a big commotion about it?
Wait, what happened?
I think Yoko Ono gave Nike the rights to use the song in a commercial.
So what was wrong with that?
Well, people were kind of annoyed that Lennon was talking about this great Revolution, then it's used for a sneaker commercial.
Oh, I see.
Yeah, and then Heaven's Gate happened with Nike.
