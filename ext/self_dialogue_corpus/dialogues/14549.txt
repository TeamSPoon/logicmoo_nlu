Do you like basketball?
I do,  I very much enjoy watching it.  Do you?
I love basketball, I used to play in middle school
I never played, was it fun?
Yes, it was so much fun, I also enjoyed being part of a team.
I wish I did that.   My team is the Grizzlies.  Whose yours?
I like the Boston Celtics
They are a good team.
So are the Grizzlies.  Have you been to any of there games?
All of them. I have season passes. They even give out some cool stuff on different games.
That sounds cool. What have you gotten?
I got a scarf, socks, wrapping paper, and other things.
I've only been to a few games. I don't know if the Celtics do that or not
They probably do, I think all teams do it.
The atmosphere at the games is fun thought, and I love halftime
Yea it's great, we have a super Grizzlies and he does all kinds of funny stuff.
I'll have to check it out if I ever come to Memphis.
It's a great time
It sounds like it  we just have a guy in a wierd hat.
Does he do anything cool?
