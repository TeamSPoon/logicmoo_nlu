Kevin Hart has really gotten popular over the last few years.
I heard he was pretty funny in Get Hard with Will Ferrell.
I heard that, too. He's been in quite a few movies recently.
I want to see the movie that came out last year with Ice Cube. What's it called again?
Oh, you're thinking of Ride Along 2. My sister told me the first one was hilarious.
I hope so. Ice Cube was just in another comedy movie, too.
Yeah, he starred in Fist Fight with Charlie Day.
Ice Cube was in the 21 Jump Street movies as well.
That's right. I forgot about that.
Now that I'm thinking about it I never realized he was in so many comedy movies.
