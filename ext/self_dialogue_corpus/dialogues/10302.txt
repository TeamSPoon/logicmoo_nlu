Do you like the Indiana Jones series?
I love them. My favorite of the series has to be Raiders of the Lost Ark.
Oh that's a great one. I prefer The Temple of Doom.
That one had so many classic scenes. Harrison Ford was great in those.
He really was. And Sean Connery playing his father was excellent.
That was The Last Crusade right?
Yes, that was entertaining all the way through. I didn't care for The Crystal Skull though.
Yes Shia LeBeouf is not one of my favorite actors.
I liked him in Transformers though. The action was great.
To me there was just a little too much action in those, even for an action movie.
