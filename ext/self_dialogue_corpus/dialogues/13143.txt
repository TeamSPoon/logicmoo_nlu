Which Star Wars movie has your favorite opening crawl text?
I really like the first line from The Force Awakens.
Yeah, me too - it was very exciting and set the stage for trying to find Luke Skywalker.
I wonder how many drafts of Star Wars crawls they go through.
Are you a fan of Boba Fett?
Absolutely - I wonder sometimes if he survived the Sarlaac Pit and they will bring him back.
It would be a stretch, but perhaps Boba Fett could make some sort of cameo.
I always liked his ship too in The Empire Strikes Back.
The X-wing fighter remains my favorite ship.
Yes, the Death Star trench run from the 1977 Star Wars was pretty epic.
