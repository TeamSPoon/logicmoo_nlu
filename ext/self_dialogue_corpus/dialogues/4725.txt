What do you think is an acceptable batting average?
I think that question is hard to answer.
How so?
There are a bunch of mitigating factors.
Like what?
How good is the hitter? Is he a power hitter? Contact hitter?
Ok lets start with the power hitter.
Alright since they tend to make contact that is productive I would say .270
And how about for contact hitters?
Acceptable would be .310
Those are some pretty lofty goals.
Well singles hitters need to spray the ball more and they usually do.
And power hitters?
They make more long outs so thats why I would dip them below .300
I just think .310 is too high for an acceptable rate, that would lead the league sometimes
No, I think .350 and above should be a league leader.
How about for a power hitter who leads the league in batting
If that were the case I would say .320.
Its hard to judge based just on batting average I guess
Thats where I Was going
