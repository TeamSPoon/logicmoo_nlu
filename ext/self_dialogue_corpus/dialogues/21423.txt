Have you seen any good movies lately?
No, I haven't been to the theater in awhile. Have you seen anything good?
I just seen the newest Fast and the Furious movie.
Is that the 7th one in the series?
No its actually the 8th.
What is it called?
It's called the Fate of the Furious.
That's an interesting name. Was it any good.
It was awesome. They definitely did not disappoint.
Who are some of the main actors in it?
It has your usual stars, like The Rock and Vin Diesel.
Oh I love them in movies.
Ya, me too. It also has Michelle Rodrigues, Jason Stathom, and Charlize Theron as a new comer.
I like all of them. What is it about?
Without giving to much away, it is basically about Vin Diesel character having to make some hard choices and temporarily betraying his group.
That doesn't sound like him.
Ya but there is a good reason and a good story line. You will just have to wait and see.
Ya I really want to go now. When did it first come out?
It came out on April 14, 2017. So if you want to see it you might have to wait until it comes out on video now.
Aw man. That really stinks. You got me all excited and now I have to wait.
