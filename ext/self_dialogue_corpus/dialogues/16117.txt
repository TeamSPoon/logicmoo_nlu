I love listening to music.
Me too. It always puts me in a great mood.
Yeah, especially if I'm in a bad mood to start with. What kind of music do you like?
I like a lot of things but mostly alternative.
Do you have a favorite band?
Yeah, probably Genesis is my favorite. I have a lot of their albums. Phil Collins and Peter Gabriel, too.
I LOVE Genesis! I used to listen to "Second Home by the Sea" every single day on the stair climber at the gym.
That's a great song!
I know! I must have played at least 300 times and I never have been the least bit sick of it.
I love the drums in that one. I used to play drums when I was younger.
I love Phil Collins. He was such a great drummer.
"In the Air Tonight"
Yes! I love that.
The Genesis songs have so much emotion. Some of them make me cry"
Like which ones?
Mostly the earlier stuff. Like "Supper's Ready"
I've never heard of that one.
Most people don't know too much of the older songs. They were amazing and so unique.
Too bad they broke up.
Yeah, such a shame.
