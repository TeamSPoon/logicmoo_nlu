Do you remember the movie Frozen that came out few years ago
yea, it feels like almost yesterday, cause that was such a guilty movie
why is that?
I think it has something to do with the main theme music, let it go
haha, it's so addictive right? I can't stop humming it after seeing the movie
exactly, and we are all adults now, so that automatically makes you feel guilty
but kids really love them, Disney really has the magic of making great animations
that I can't deny, can't wait to see the next Disney animation
me too
I heard there is a new one coming out in July
