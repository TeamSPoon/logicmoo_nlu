Have you seen Attack on Titan?
I've seen the show and the movie, but I don't follow the Manga.
How'd you see the movie? It wasn't released.
It was, but in very select theaters.
I saw it but had to do an illegal stream to see it.
So, did you have a question?
How did you like it?
I hated it passionately, despite the plot being awesome.
I like that the other human civilizations are the ones making and sending the Titans.
Me too, but the technology to do that makes no sense.
How so?
Well, they have their flying devices and super-advanced DNA manipulation, yet they don't have lights.
Ha, never thought of that.
Did you like the live-action Titans and how they looked?
The colossal titan was great when he emerged because he was "steaming" like he was just made.
That was definitely a cool visual.
I thought Eren's Titan form was a bit... ugly.
Yeah, but looks don't matter when you're 100 feet tall.
The visuals overall were really well-done, but something lacked.
It's the acting. I don't want to sound improper, but Japanese shows and movies are full of over-acting.
