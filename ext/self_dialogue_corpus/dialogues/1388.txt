I read the other day that Zach Orr might be coming out of retirement and coming back to the NFL.
He used to play for Baltimore Ravens, didn't he?
Yeah, he was a great linebacker.
Why did he retire? Wasn't he injured or something?
He retired in January because he had a spinal condition.
Did he have surgery or something that made it better?
He's had some new opinions from doctors that he might be okay to play.
Wouldn't a spinal problem seem permanent?
He had a condition he's had since birth, where one of his vertebrae never fully formed.
And the doctors told him he had to retire for something he's always had?
They told him at first he was more likely to have an injury.
Back problems can be scary. Even normal people can end up sidelined from work from them.
Well, he had a lot more doctors examine him, and they are saying he's not at any more risk than anyone else.
So he's thinking about coming back?
He said when he first announced he was retiring, if there was anyway he could return that he would.
He's still pretty young, isn't he?
He's only 24, so yeah he still had some years left to play.
I would be tempted to come back too.
At first they said he could be paralyzed or die. But now they said the main concern is not playing with herniated discs, and his have subsided.
I think all NFL players risk injury, it's part of the game. I could see how he would be tempted to come back if he could.
