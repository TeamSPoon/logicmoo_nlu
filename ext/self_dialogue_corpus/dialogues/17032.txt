I can't stand today's music. Have you found anything worth listening to?
I know what you mean, everything is starting to sound like electronic garbage.
My son thinks computer generated noise is music. I disagree.
I miss listening to vocals AND instruments.
Even the vocals are so distorted, I can't seem to find good actual singers.
Surprisingly I have found a few bands and singers I like, finally.
Please let me in on the secret, I'm sick of listening to classic rock stations.
I absolutely love Imagine Dragons.
What's so great about them?
So many of their songs sound like instant classics now, like the good old days.
Do they have many songs though?
Yes, I seem to like everything they do. Pink is a good singer too.
I don't really like female singers.
Neither do I but she is really talented and writes her own songs.
Oh, I like that. I know she has been around a while too.
She is very good. If you want to listen to good pop music, Taylor Swift can be good.
She sounds too young for me.
I thought so too but her songs can be fun and she's another one who writes her own.
Too often, I turn on the radio expecting rock or pop and I have to listen to hip-hop horribleness.
I know. I am tired of it. I end up spending the whole time in the car changing the radio station.
