Hey Mark, are you ready for the NFL season to start?
I sure am, I can't wait!
Same here, who do you think will win it all?
I'm not entirely sure, but I think the Patriots will have a chance to defend their title.
I'm afraid I have to agree with you, but I hope some other team wins the Superbowl, I'm getting tired of the Patriots always winning.
Me too, but you can't deny that they are a great team.
They sure are!
Who do you think can beat them?
Hmmm, well Atlanta should still be a good team.
Yeah, if they can shake off that horrible loss.
True, true...Green Bay and Dallas should both be pretty good this year.
Yes!  With their young talent, Dallas should have a great year.
For some reason, I also like Kansas City's chances.
Kansas City?  Really?
Yeah, I'm not sure why, but they always seem to be pretty good.
Pretty good isn't always good enough in the NFL though.
Thats true.
It will definitely be an interesting season.
I agree.  I am so looking forward to the season.
Me too!
