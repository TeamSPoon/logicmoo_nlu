what artist do you like that switched genres?
Well I love gwen stefani.
Has she really changed genres?
yes! She was totally reggae ska to pop.
Well she always seemed eclectic and multifaceted.
Who do you think is a good example.
well snoop dogg.
When did he ever switch from rap?
Don't you recall snop lion?
Oh ya, he did go through a reggae phase.
I enjoyed his reggae album.
But come on that was  just a phase.
True. he has come back to his original vibe, sound and name.
So who else has actually fully switched?
Taylor swift. Country to pop.
But will she stay pop?
I think she has had so much success with it , no way will she switch back.
I could see her doing a country song or two.
Maybe, but I think pop is the right place for her.
She is a good artist either genre.
