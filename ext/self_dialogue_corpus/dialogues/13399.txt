Have you seen Rogue One yet?
No, I haven't.
Oh man, you gotta see it!
I know, I'm really slacking.
I think it's my favorite Star Wars now.
Really! That's pretty high praise.
Well I definitely like it better than any of the prequels, and also the Force Awakens.
But better than Empire?
Maybe. I've watched that one so many times, and Rogue One was the most exciting film I've scene since I don't know when.
Wow. Well I'll definitely have to move that one to the top of my list of movies to see next.
