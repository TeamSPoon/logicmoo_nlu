What music do you listen to with your kids?
All kinds of stuff.
Like what?
They love the beatles, and my son especially loves Seal.
Really?
Especially Kiss From a Rose.
No, I mean- you play that music for them?
Why wouldn't I?
Because it's not for kids.
That makes no sense. It's not like it's inappropriate.
No... I guess it isn't.
It totally isn't. I'm not playing them Wutang Clan stuff or anything.
But shouldn't they be listening to Raffi or something?
Oh, don't get me wrong. Raffi's actually pretty rad.
He is. Baby Beluga was my jam.
Mhm. But in my experience, kids feel the same way that we do about kids music.
What do you mean?
I mean, they think it sucks, just like we do.
No way.
Yeah. The second you play them some real music, they can tell the difference. Try it next time. They'll love it.
