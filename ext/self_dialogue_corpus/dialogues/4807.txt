Wow. The benches cleared in Los Angeles last night!
I saw the video. What even happened?
A Marlins pitcher threw behind Brett Eibner, got him in the back.
Was it on purpose?
Some people think so. But noting happened that led up to it.
And the Dodgers retaliated.
Yeah, you have to be crazy to throw at Giancarlo Stanton.
I would be terrified to see him coming at me with a bat.
I actually thought some punches were going to be thrown.
I know, it got really heated really fast.
Dave Roberts and Don Mattingly were right in the middle of it.
It's always surprising to see managers in the middle of a scrum.
Chase Utley looked like a dad trying to break up a playground fight.
That was hilarious. He was having none of it.
I'm glad no one got hurt.
Me too. It really looked like it was going to get bad.
I can't believe Mattingly's explanation of it.
Yes! Being down by five is no reason to throw at a batter.
The league really needs to do something about that.
I agree. Fights are entertaining but so dangerous and juvenile.
