What is your favorite movie?
I don't know.
Come on, think of one.
Okay... Independence Day.
Excellent choice!
Why?
Just wondering.  Who's your favorite actor in it?
Jeff Goldblum.
Awesome.  You know he's from Pittsburgh, right?
No way, I didn't know that.
Yep, I saw a documentary about him coming back here and doing some type of Broadway musical.
Really?  Which one?
I don't remember, but the managed to film him crying in it.
Oh, why?
Dramatic effect I guess.  It really didn't add to the movie.
I bet not.
What other movies do you like him in?
Um... The Jurassic Park movies and The Fly.
I love The Fly.
Yeah, it really was a great remake.
