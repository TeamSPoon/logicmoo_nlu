Who do you think the best defensive player is in the NFL?
I can't really pick one.
I think it is JJ Watt.
He is a tough player.
Yes he is.
I played OL in High School and can't imagine trying to block someone like him.
It would be nearly impossible.
He is strong and fast.
Yes he is.
I think I have thought of another player I think is best.
Who is that?
Von Miller.
Good choice.
Linebacker is a tough position.
It is for sure.
You have to be able to really read the offense.
Yup, have to have your eyes up at all times.
Von does that really well.
He does.  He also finds the gaps and hits hard.
Good tackler as well.
