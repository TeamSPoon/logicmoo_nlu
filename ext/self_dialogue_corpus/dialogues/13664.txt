Where do you think the Star Wars movies are going?
I think Disney has added something to them
It seems like they will be going for a while
It is very entertaining
I'm sure they'll make some spinoffs
The Star Wars Universe is big, there's room for it
I wonder if they will go into the future in the next series or go further back
I think they would go further forward if they do a third trilogy
Maybe they will just keep changing the cast and have new Jedi
The original cast might be too old to be in those
