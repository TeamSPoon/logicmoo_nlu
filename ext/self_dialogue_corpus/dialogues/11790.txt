George is such an underrated guitarist.
I think he's rated just fine.
His solo on "Taxman" is great.
Actually Paul played that.
No he didn't.
He did, because George couldn't nail a perfect take on the day.
But Paul was the bassist.
Paul can play anything.
I didn't know that.
George is good, but Paul was really a prodigy.
