Who is the greatest Sith? Other than Vader, that's too easy.
Darth Maul is my favorite.
He's not that powerful in the force though. His skill is all sword play.
I don't agree. It would take incredible force powers to master his double sword.
Maybe, but he doesn't seem to use any other force techniques with any regularity.
Like what?
Force push, force choke, force jump, things like that.
Does anyone other than Darth Vader?
Kylo Ren uses force moves quite a bit. Remember when he stopped that laser blast in mid-air?
That was cool. Do you think he is more powerful than Vader?
