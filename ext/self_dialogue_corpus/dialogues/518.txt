Old time football

Lester Hayes and his stick um
I know right. He use to have that crap all over the place
Helmet. Hands. Legs. Feet.
I'm surprised he didn't stick to the ground.
That would have been funny.
Was nice when people were allowed to hit people not like today.
Nowadays if you look at someone wrong you get a flag.
I know its stupid.
Like the stupid celebration flags
No Fun League

Goodell has to go
