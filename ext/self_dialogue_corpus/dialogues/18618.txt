There have been so many good musicians that have died in the past couple of years.
I know it is sad.
Just recently Gregg Alllman.
Yea he was great.
How about David Bowie?
Yea, liver cancer , such a shame.
He put out a cd right before his death.
I know , that one is pretty sad and depressing.
True.
Who else?
Oh Glenn Frye of the Eagles.
He had a beautiful voice. All the Eagles Did.
I remember another one too.
Who is that?
George Michael, he was only 53.
Boy that is really young, of what?
Natural causes they day.
Sad.
So sad that they won't be making music anymore.
But thank god we can listen to the music they did do.
