Whats some music you've been listening to lately?
I like Twenty One Pilots.
Cool, what genre are they?
Their genre is pretty hard to define.
Can you try?
They make alternative rock music with some pop.
Sounds pretty basic.
No, the music is really good.
What do you like about it?
The lyrics are really deep and heart felt. A lot of people think it's angsty teen stuff but it's really good.
Whats a favorite lyric of yours?
"All we are is an isle of flightless birds We find our worth in giving birth and stuff We're lining our homes against winding roads And we think the going is tough"
Wow, that is deep.
I know.
Are all of their songs like that?
No, they do have a few poppier songs, but they all have great lyrics.
I think I'll check them out.
Cool.
Whats your favorite album?
I like their self titled album best.
