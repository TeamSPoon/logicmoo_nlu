Who is your favorite team?
The tennessee titans.
Oh.  Do you think they will do well this year?
Yeah.  I think they have a decent shot to win the division.
Will Mariota play at the beginning of the season?
I think he will be ready by then.
He just needs to stay healthy for the whole year.
That will be the key.
What else do you like about the team?
They have a pretty good offensive line.
What about their running backs?
Demarco Murray did pretty well.  I think he was third in rushing yards last season.
What about their receivers?
I think they have a good young bunch.
Do you think they will develop this year?
Yes.  I am expecting Tajae Sharpe to step up and have a breakthrough year.
Didn't they get Decker?
Yeah.  But he is getting old.
You don't think he will be a playmaker?
No, probably not.
