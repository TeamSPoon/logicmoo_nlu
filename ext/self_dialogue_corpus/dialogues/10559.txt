Hey bud! I didn't expect to see you here tonight!
Well, I've been kind of down. I had to get out of the house.
What's wrong?
Oh, nothing major, just a lot of fighting at home.
I'm sorry to hear that. What movie are you going to see?
I've really been wanting to see Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2.
That's the movie I just came from!
Did you like it?
I loved it! It will surely cheer you up.
I sure hope so.
The character's are so funny! I think I like Rocket the best.
Oh right, that's the raccoon. I like him too.
Did you see the first Guardians?
Yes.
Did you like the soundtrack?
It was pretty good.
Well the soundtrack in the new one is awesome!
I'm really more interested in the action scenes.
Oh you won't be disappointed. Have fun!
Thanks. See you around.
