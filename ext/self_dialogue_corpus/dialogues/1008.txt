Do you like the 49ers?
I used to
Why did you stop?
Rice left
He was great
Best wide receiver ever
Do you like them at all?
They are okay
Did you see them face the Ravens?
Yes
Were you disappointed?
Yes
I hope they get back to the Super Bowl
Me too
They have a good team I think
Same here. But, I do not like their coaching
That could use some work
They play in a great stadium though
It is one of the best
They have great fans
