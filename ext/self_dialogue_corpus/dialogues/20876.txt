What movie should I watch this weekend?
How about A Million Ways to Die in the West?
I never saw it.
Very funny movie.
I would have thought it was a cowboy movie.
It is. Seth MacFarlane did it.
Then it's got to be funny.
He is great.
I've loved every movie he did.
Me too. Ted and Ted 2 were awesome.
Does he play a character?
He's the main character.
Is it real life or cartoon?
Real life.
Who else is in it?
Liam Neeson.
Really in a comedy?
Yes, remember he is in Ted too.
That's right. They must be friends.
Probably.
