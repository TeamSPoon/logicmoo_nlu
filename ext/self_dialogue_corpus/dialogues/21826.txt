Did you like the movie E.T.?
No, I hated that movie.
How could you hate E.T.? He's such a lovable character!
He's scary looking. He's brown and lumpy.
He's lost though and just wants to go back home. I can't help but love him.
I'm not the biggest fan of aliens in general. The movie Signs scared me.
I thought that movie was silly. They aliens looked so fake.
At the time, I thought the aliens looked real in that movie. I was younger when it came out though.
Wasn't Signs directed by the same guy who directed The Sixth Sense?
I think so. The Sixth Sense was so good.
I don't know if I ever actually saw that whole movie.
You should watch it. The twist is the best part.
I already know what the twist is in The Sixth Sense, should I still watch it?
I think you should.
Is it still good, even in 2017?
I think so. I haven't seen another movie like it in a while.
Bruce Willis is in it, right?
Yeah, and he's great. I think it's one of his best movies!
I'll have to watch it then.
You should watch it! Let me know what you think afterwards.
