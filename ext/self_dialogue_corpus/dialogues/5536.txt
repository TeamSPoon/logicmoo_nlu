Did you see the movie The Princess Frog?
Yes, I did, I like the part when the frog turns into a prince
Did you like the way that the princess looked?
Yes, I liked her dress, she is one of my favorite princesses.
the music in this movie was really good, I liked it when the swamp animals were dancing
I also liked that part, the music was different as was the time period.
I loved that she opened her own restaurant, did you like that part?
Yes, I did ! I wish that it was a real place so I could go and eat there!
Maybe Disney will make a place that serves food from Louisiana
Ohhh! That would be so much fun! I would love to go and eat there.
