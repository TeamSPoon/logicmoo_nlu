So what's your favourite style or artist when it comes to rap music?
That's tough. I gotta say Class A'z, which are an irish rap collective, and everything that makes Irish rap distinctive.
What do you mean? What could make them distinctive, rapping about shamrocks?
No, I mean, you get used to some of the same rhymes and word combinations repeated over American rap lyrics but since the Irish have several distint accents, that opens up a lot more opportunity for making interesting rhymes with words you never would've thought of.
I never thought of that. Is that the only thing that sets them apart?
Well I find for me personally, the lyrics are much easier to make out and the flow is smoother, almost more polished. But you'll find the themes of the songs are not that much different from what you'll find in American rap.
You mean women, inebriation and money?
No, more like social justice, minority issues and deep life questions.
That's cool. I'll definitely give those artists a listen, thanks.
No problem!
