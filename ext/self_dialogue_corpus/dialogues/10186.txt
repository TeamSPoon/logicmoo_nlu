Did you see The Road to Perdition?
Yes I loved that movie what a job Tom Hanks did
I was so sceptical of Tom Hanks as a ganster but was pleasentkly surprised
I know he was amazing in the movie
The plot was incredible and it kept me on the edge of my seat the entire movie.
My favorite part was when Tom Hanks killed the mob boss on the street
Yeah what a line Paul Newman said when he realized what was happenning "I am glad it was you"
Talk about chills what a moment
The end was so surprising too you thought Tom Hanks and his son were in the clear than bang the hitman shoots Tom Hanks in front of his son Michael.
The whole movie just blew me away. I can watch it over and over
