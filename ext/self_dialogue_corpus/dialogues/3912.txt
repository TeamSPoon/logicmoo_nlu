Is Heathers a thriller?
I would say so.
Christian Slater is great as the bad guy
Yeah. The end is really good. I thought he was gonna blow up the school.
Wynona Ryder did great in that too.
Yeah. That scene in the woods was sad though when those two guys got shot.
I agree. I felt bad for that girl that everyone made fun of too.
But, it was very thrilling.
True
Shannon Doherty was in it too.
