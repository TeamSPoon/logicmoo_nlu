I swear First Wives Club is the funniest movie in the world.
No way, the best comedy is Mean Girls.
Oh, that's a great movie. Tina Fey is so talented.
She wrote it, right?
Yeah, she wrote it and produced it, I think.
I absolutely love Rachel McAdams at the queen bee.
She was great as was Lindsay Lohan.
And who would have thought that Amanda Seyfried would blossom into this major star.
She deserves it. She's really talented.
And she was so funny as Karen in Mean Girls!
