Have you seen Moana?
Yes, Moana is my son's favorite movie!
I thought it was fun to watch with my son.
My son loves the songs in the movie.
I found myself singing along, too!
Do you think that Disney will make a Moana 2?
As successful as the first Moana was, I would not be surprised.
My son certainly would watch it. He has seen the first Moana at least 20 times.
He hasn't gotten tired of it yet?
No, not even close! He loves the movie!
