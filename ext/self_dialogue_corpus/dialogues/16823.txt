So, who is your favorite band of all time?
Oh, that's easy!  It's The Grateful Dead!
Oh, I miss Jerry Garcia, it's like another "day the music died" feel ya know?
Yeah, but there's a bunch of Dead tribute bands out there, so you'll still be able to get your live Deadhead fix.
Which Dead tribute band do you think is the best out of them all?
Hands down, it's The Schwag.
Oh, that band out of St. Louis?  I've heard they have a massive following too.
Yeah, there used to be festivals surrounding them.  One was called Schwagstock...was held at Camp Zoe every year.
I've seen them play at EarthDance in 2009, it was amazing!
I just love jam bands like The Dead & The Schwag.
Oh I know!  It's amazing how they can all just start playing whatever they want, and everyone just picks up the melody & beat.
That's the beautiful part about it!
So, have you heard if any of the other members of The Dead are going to be getting together anytime soon for another concert or anything?
No, I sure haven't.  It'd be one hell of a show if they did!
Yeah, what they SHOULD do is start having those laser shows with Grateful Dead music.
Oh you mean like they do for Pink Floyd?
Exactly like that!  Do you know how many people would go to that?
There's a FORTUNE to be made with that type of concert!
I really do miss The Grateful Dead concerts.
Well, at least we still have the music, with that, the band will live on forever.
