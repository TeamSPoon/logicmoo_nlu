I'm kind of tired of superhero villains attacking the same places.
You mean San Fran, LA, New York, Chicago...
Yeah, it's a bit redundant.
Where would you like them to attack?
Maybe Miami, Orlando, Atlanta, Portland, Buffalo...
As much as I hate those awful cities, it wouldn't work.
Why not?
Outside of Disney World, there are no big landmarks there.
Would you prefer a small town?
That already happened in Thor, and it worked, mostly. There lacked a human element, though.
