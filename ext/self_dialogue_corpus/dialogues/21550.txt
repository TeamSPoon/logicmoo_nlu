Did you go to movies last night?
Yeah, I just saw the best movie. I saw the new alien movie.
Was it good?
Yeah, the new alien creature is awesome.
I love those movies. You never know who is going to bite it.
Yeah, bunch of people bit it but there's a twist.
Really?
Yeah, it's unexpected but I won't spoil it.
Glad it's back on aliens and not on Promethus.
But it's tied together. You can see the link. Big explanation.
Hmmm, interesting. I might have to check it out.
You should. If you saw the others you'll like this one. The space scenes are really cool.
Great. I really like those.
Yeah, I think the lead is from Harry Potter, the Fantastical Beast.
I didn't see those. Isn't Fastbender the AI character?
Yeah, he's really good. Kind of still like an android but he makes the movie.
He was great in Assasin's Creed.
I didn't see that. Was it good?
Yeah, it's wicked. You should check it out.
Will do. Maybe this weekend.
