I'm planning to stream some comedies this weekend, got any recommendations?
Yes! Watch "Popstar"!
Oh, the one with the Lonely Island Boys? I think they're hilarious!
Not exactly the Lonely Island Boys. Similar concept, but Andy Samberg plays this silly, vain popstar and he has sidekicks, which are the other two guys in Lonely Island.
Sounds funny. So there are a lot of songs too?
Yes, the songs are hilarious! I was crying.
They're that funny? Were there any cameos?
Yeah, tons, like Ringo Starr, Pink, Usher. It's sort of like a mockumentary.
I love mockumentaries, like "Waiting for Guffman" and all of Christopher Guest's movies.
I do too -- my favorite of his is "Best in Show." So funny!
