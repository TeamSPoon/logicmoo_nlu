Have you heard any good music lately?
I've been listening to a lot of country music.  It seems like there are always new songs coming out.
I heard a great one the other day.  It was called The Way I Talk.
Oh, the Morgan Wallen song?
I don't know who sings it.
Yeah, that's gotta be the one.  It's a new release, right?
Yep!  It had a great tune and funny lyrics.
Yeah, I really like that one too.
I've never heard of Morgan Wallen before though, is he new?
Yeah, and apparently that's his only single so far.
I hope he releases some more stuff.  I really like the sound of his voice.
Yeah, he definitely has potential.  He was actually on The Voice.
Oh really?  Is that where he got his start?
I guess you could say that.
Has he been on tour yet?
Yeah, I think he's touring with Florida Georgia Line, or he was anyway.
They're a pretty big name.
I know.  Hopefully he'll be a new up and coming star.
Well in the meantime I'm loving his new single.
Yeah it's great!
