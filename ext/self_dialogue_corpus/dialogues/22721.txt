Hey what's your favorite superhero movie?
Oh man that's really tough, there are so many. I'm going to have to say Civil War.
Good choice! You're right there are a lot, but I'd say that mine has probably got to be Iron Man three.
Tony Stark is pretty awesome. I really love the dialogue that Joss Whedon gave him in the original Avengers.
Joss whedon is such an amazing director. I love everything he's ever done.
Yeah I was sad that he didn't direct the sequels, but I understand what he was saying about just being tired.
Do you a favorite Marvel superhero? Mine is obviously Iron Man.
I've got to say mine is Thor. I mean you just can't beat that guy, he's amazing.
He certainly is one of the more overpowered characters. I liked that they cast Natalie Portman in his movies.
That was a solid choice. What's your favorite movie that she's been in?
Well I haven't seen a ton of her movies, but she was in Star Wars so I guess I've got to say that.
Those were the worst Star Wars movies though, to be fair.
Yeah but the brand and the lore alone makes it awesome, regardless of how terrible the directing was.
I guess that's one of the few properties that can say that. Fans got mad, but ultimately still went to theaters to see it.
Good special effects can do that for you. Just like at every Michael Bay movie ever made.
Explosions, explosions, explosions! There's a new Transformers out but I don't even know if I want to see it.
Oh why not? I think I might.
Well there are so many of them out already. It's just starting to get a little old.
You've got a good point. And I hated what he did to the Ninja Turtles.
Stop ruining our childhood Michael Bay! Go back to Director's school!
