So who is your favorite rapper?
I like Jay-Z and Drake.
Did you hear that Jay-Z and Beyonce had their babies?
Yeah, I guess we won't be getting another album from him any time soon.
That song he did with MIA a few years ago was really good, I think it was called XXXO.
I liked that album but I really preferred his old stuff like Hard Knock Life.
That's true, his older stuff was better.  Ever since he had his "retirement party" it feels like his stuff just isn't as fresh.
After The Black Album is when it started to go downhill for me.
I wish he would collab with some of today's artists and come out with a really good album.
Yeah, but like I said he probably won't be able to work on anything for a while.  Plus, he kind of isn't that relevant anymore.
