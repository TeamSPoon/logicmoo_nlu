Ask some questions to a baseball guru!
Avasail Garcia, buy or sell?
Sell. High BABIP suggests it's good luck.
Should White Sox trade Robertson? What could they get?
He'd be in demand, but I think the Sox would need to eat some money to get anything of real good value.
Freddie Freeman's injury bad or not big deal?
Out for 10 weeks so that's not good. If he makes it through rehab without complications he should return to form.
When do you think major trades start happening?
I'd guess first week of June, thereabouts.
Brewers for real or do they fall back to earth?
Good one. That's still tough to tell, I'd guess they don't win the central but could still be in the WC mix.
Can the Angels make a run and win their division?
Houston looks to be running away, so the Angels can battle around for Wildcard as well. I'd think Texas has a better shot, though.
You think the Rangers are still in it? I'm hearing people talk about the moving Darvish already.
People talk, but Beltre is coming back and they can easily hang around.
SO you don't think they move Darvish?
Only if they drop out of contention for sure and I don't expect that to happen.
Doug Fister signed with the Angels can he get back into old form?
Fister? I hardly knew her. Haven't seen him in a while so lets see him throw some minor league innings first.
LOL good point
