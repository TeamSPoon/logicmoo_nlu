A good comedy would be great right now.
I agree, we should pick one out to watch.
That sounds fun, what do you have in mind?
I love Adam Sandler movies! Want to watch one of his?
That would be great. Do you have Big Daddy?
No, sorry I sure dont. I have Mr.Deeds though.
I saw that one a long time ago. I remember liking it a lot!
Yea it is a really good movie.
Most of his movies are really entertaining.
They sure are!
