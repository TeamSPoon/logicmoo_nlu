What do you think of the Beatles?
I like them but I have to be in the mood for it.
Do you think they deserve all the acclaim they get?
I didn't grow up listening to them.  I started listening to them when I was an adult and I think their songs are really good.
Do you have a favorite Beatles era?
Yeah.  I liked their earlier stuff.
What was wrong with their later stuff?
I thought the psychedelic music was made to push the drug culture.
Do you like "A day in the life"?
No. Not really.  I didn't like the ending.
