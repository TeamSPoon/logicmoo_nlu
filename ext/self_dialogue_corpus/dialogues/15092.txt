Have you ever seen the movie Bad Moms?
Yes, it was hillarious! I love that Mila Kunis played the main character, Amy.
Yes, she was so funny in That 70's Show. I liked Christina Applegate the most though.
She was so funny at the end when she became friends with them!
I know, I wasn't expecting that!
I really liked the scene when they threw the party at Amy's house.
Me too. Kathryn Hahn was so funny! I couldn't stop laughing.
She says so many funny things in that movie.
Yes, she really did make the movie much funnier.
If Kathryn Hahn wasn't in the movie it wouldn't have been as good at all!
