Do you have any bands or albums or songs that changed your life?
I bet I have quite a few. First one that comes to mind is My Aim is True.
Elvis Costello, right? I'm sort of surprised.
I still remember the first time I heard it. I had a restaurant job the summer between high school and college. I wasn't happy with it. Just dragged myself there every night.
So, go on.
One night I stopped by Marilyn's house before work because she had a new album she wanted me to hear, and it was My Aim is True.
When did that come out? Like '77, '78?
It was '77, at least in the States. Summer of '77.
So what was it about the album?
He had so much anger. Some of it was on the surface, like I'm not Angry and Blame it on Cain, some of it was just this enormous mass of seething anger under the surface, like Watching the Detectives and I'm Not Angry.
So anger changed your life?
Well, in a way it did. It gave me focus for my dissatisfaction, and pulled me out of my general malaise.
Yes, I guess I can see that, for you. You still have that anger, as well as a continual rebalancing of anger and malaise.What's your favorite song from the album.
That's hard. I love so many of them. I think it would be easier to name the ones I am a little bit less than crazy about.
Okay, what are they?
I feel like No Dancing and Mystery Dance just fall a little bit below the level of the rest of the album. But that's okay. No one can hit a homerun every time they are up.
You didn't ask, but my favorite on the album is Alison. I could listen to it ten times in a row.
I love that song, too.His sadness and regret are palpable. And his feeling of having been cheated to the utmost.
Yes, I feel like it is almost a match for Good Year for the Roses.
Oh, good point. I love that song, too.
