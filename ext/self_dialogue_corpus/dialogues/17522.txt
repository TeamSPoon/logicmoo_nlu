OK, almost party time, let's pick out some music to play!
Alright, this should be fun. What kind of vibe are you thinking?
Just kind of laid back and pleasant. Not like dance music.
This should be easy.
Let's put some Spoon on the playlist.
Good call, Spoon is a lot of fun. Most of the stuff on Ga Ga Ga Ga Ga would work.
Done. What else?
Phoenix has some good stuff.
Oh yeah, they're a good choice too. They've got that new album out; I know the first three tracks on it would all be good.
Cool. Let's get something a little less current next.
Good idea. Have you heard of The Meters?
No, what are they like?
They're an instrumental funk band that's been around since the 70's.
Sounds like good party music.
Yeah, they're not like George Clinton or anything; I think they'll suit the mood.
Here's an idea: what about some of Elliott Smith's more upbeat songs?
That's an idea. His later stuff then, I guess.
Yeah that should do it.
I think we've got a solid playlist now!
Me too; should be good party music for mixing!
