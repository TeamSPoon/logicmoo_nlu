What's your favorite Batman movie?
Batman.
You mean that really old Batman movie with Michael Keaton in it?
Yes, it's got a great Batman with Jack Nicholson as the Joker And it's cool.
What about the Dark Knight? it's got Heath Ledger's Joker and Christopher Nolan as a director.
Don't like it, it's a Joker movie more than a Batman movie.
You're killing me man.
Rewatch the movie, Batman is dumb. The Joker outsmarts him, Alfred and Luscious Fox are smarter. The man is nothing without his gadgets.
It's still a great movie.
Not if you want to see a Batman movie.
