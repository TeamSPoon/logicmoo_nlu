Did you hear that Childish Gambino is retiring from making music?
Who's Childish Gambino?
A rapper. It's actually Donald Glover's stage name.
I thought he was an actor, I didn't know he was a rapper as well.
Yeah, he's actually been a rapper almost as long as he's been an actor. His first album came out in 2008.
Oh, that's cool. He's pretty funny on "Community." What's his music like?
It sounds like a lot of modern rap, but there's definitely a quirky and sort of nerdy personality in his lyrics.
What do you mean?
Well, he makes a lot of obscure references and plays on words. He also has a sort of ironic persona as a rapper.
What's ironic about it?
Sometimes he likes to be a little outrageous and over-the-top in a way that makes it clear that he's not being serious.
So he's kind of mocking other artists who are mainstream right now.
Yeah, but he also has a serious side. A lot of his lyrics are soul-searching, and he can be romantic as well.
That's pretty unusual for a rapper, isn't it?
Actually, it's not uncommon for rappers to release some kind of "ballad" single that appeals to a wider audience.
How does that make him different then?
Well, he never really loses the complexity and subtlety when he's going in that direction. Even the radio hits are still appealing on many different levels.
That's impressive. It seems like so much music on the radio right now is catchy, but pretty dumb when you get down to it.
I agree! Sometimes it seems like you can't have music that's both catchy and smart, but I think Childish Gambino manages to pull it off.
I'll have to check him out then. Too bad he's retiring!
