I am so sick of Lebron.
Yeah me too.  He just keeps crushing the terrible East.
Yeah like that is some huge accomplishment.
Yeah I mean Isiah Thomas at 5 foot 9 also has been killing the East.
Kind of shows you just how terrible the East is.
Yeah and soon Carmelo is going to head West too.
You think so?
Yeah he is going to end up on the Clippers I bet.
Oh! I like the idea of that. You think they will have to get rid of Blake?
Possibly, or at least Reddick.
Yeah I wonder where he will go then.
I hope he goes to Milwaukee to add some shooting.
Oh I love that idea too.  Riddick in Milwaukee would be fun.
Yeah that might make the East a little better too.
Well, I don't know about that.  The bucks seem fake to me.
Yeah I could see that but I think you are only saying that since you are a Chicago fan.
Don't get me started  on my dumpster fire.
What? You aren't happy with Butler?
Well, I just think he is over rated.
I could see that.  He definitely loves ISO ball too much.
