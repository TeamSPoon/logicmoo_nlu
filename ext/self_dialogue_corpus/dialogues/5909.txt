Have you seen any good disney movies lately?
I watched the new Beauty and Beast movie last night.
Who was your favorite character?
I really like the beast. Who's yours?
I liked Chip the teacup. He's funny and cute.
All the animated objects were funny.
They really updated the design of the object characters.
Why was Lumeer the only one with legs I wonder?
That was a little strange.
It was a good movie if you overlook some of the features of the objects.
