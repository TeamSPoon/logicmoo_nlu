I love thriller movies. Anything that keeps you on the edge of your seat.
Have you seen "Don't Breathe?" It was probably one of the most suspenseful movies I've ever seen?
What's it about?
It's about some kids who break into a blind veteran's house and get trapped in there. I don't want to say anymore.
Sounds creepy. Have you seen "Hush?"
No. What's that one about?
It's about this deaf girl who's a writer, so she moves to the country and then this guy tries to come to her house and kill her.
Cool. Did you ever see "The Others."
Yes! That was an awesome one.
My favorite is "A Perfect Murder."
