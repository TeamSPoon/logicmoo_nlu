What does the movie title "The BFG" stand for?
The Big Friendly Giant
Oh that makes sense.  I didn't see it.
It was a pretty good movie.  Directed by Steven Spielberg.
Oh wow, I didn't know that.
Yes, it got great reviews too, but didn't do as big as it should at the box office.
Ya, I didn't see many commercials for it.  But remember the poster.
Well you should see it - it was a great movie.
Oh for sure I will.  especially since I know who directed it.
Ya - he is a great director.
