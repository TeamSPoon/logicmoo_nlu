I just got my season tickets for the Dallas cowboys.
I can't believe you bought season tickets. The cowboys suck.
Well the steelers haven't had much to brag about these days.
Just wait - they're going to turn things around this season.
Sure. And Tom Brady didn't under inflate those footballs.
Man the Pats sure got off easy over that.
Yeah. You'd think the Browns or Green Bay would try it.
I don't think anything would help the Bengals.
What's up with them? They make crappy draft picks!
Well at least that's one thing Dallas does well. I have to give em that.
And with Romo at the helm, it's gonna be another great season.
But Dallas is a one-man team. If romo gets hurt, it's all over
That's the problem with too many teams today - they have one star player instead of building a real team.
I don't know how the Pats can stand Brady getting all the attention.
Colin Kaepernick is just as bad.
Man you'd think he'd focus on the game instead of getting involved in stupid media shit.
Face it, Seattle hasn't been the same since the Steve largent days.
You got that right. I'd give anything for a Warren Moon type of QB.
Well at least the Cowboys still have Thor best cheerleaders in the league v
That's about the only good thing I could say about the Fallas Cowboys.
