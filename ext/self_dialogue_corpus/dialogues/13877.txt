What's your favorite album by Lady Gaga?
It would probably have to be The Fame, but I like all of them.
The Fame had some pretty big hits.
Oh, I know. I could listen to Paparazzi and Just Dance all day.
Me too, but I prefer her album The Fame Monster.
That one's probably my second favorite.
I tend to like her older music.
Me too. Her style was just so outrageous back then.
I know. It was see fun to see all the crazy outfits she wore.
I still can't believe she wore a dress of meat to the MTV Music Video Awards.
