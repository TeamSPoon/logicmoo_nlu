Who would you say is the best wide receiver in the NFL?
You ask me, knowing I'm a Cowboys fan?
Haha, yep, I'm asking!
Dez Bryant, of course!
A predictable answer, but not a ridiculous one. Dez Bryant is really good.
The guy does it all. He's big, he's fast, great hands, explosive after the catch.
He's a heck of a player, but I'm not sure he's #1.
Then who would you pick?
Maybe one of A.J. Green or Julio Jones.
Not going to say that either of those are bad players. I still like Dez best.
Dez is a little bit of a wild card in terms of his emotions and stuff like that, though.
He's had his issues, but I look at production on the field.
I think some of the mental stuff has spilled over into his production at times.
Possibly, but I think he's matured the longer he's been in the NFL.
Give me a guy like Julio Jones who puts his head down and goes to work on the field.
And I say, give me a guy who wears his heart on his sleeve and has passion for the game.
I think the main thing is, give me a guy who's 6'3" and runs like the wind!
Yeah, that always helps!
It's weird to think about a league where Megatron isn't in the conversation.
Yeah, the NFL is less cool with him retired.
