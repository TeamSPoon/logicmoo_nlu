Hey how do you feel about the upcoming NFL season?
I dont know, I am not really into Tom Brady this year.
I can understand that, any other players you have your eyes on?
Not in particular, the last season was very underwhelming.
Some people would disagree.
Would you disagree with me?
I think there are some great up and coming players this year.
No one really stands out to me but I am glad you feel that way.
Are there any teams you are rooting for at least?
Ive always been a Seahawks fan I suppose.
Me too! My entire family loves them.
The Miami Dolphins are interesting too however.
I am not a big fan of anyone on that team but the coach has done good work in the past.
A team is no better than it's coach.
I completely agree, coaches are underappreciated.
Hey, do any of your kids watch football with you?
Roy isn't a big fan, he is more into baseball.
What about Stephanie?
Suprisingly she is always down to watch the games with me.
That is very suprising.
