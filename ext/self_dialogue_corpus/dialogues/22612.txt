What is your favorite movie of all time?
Beauty and the Beast is my favorite movie so far.
Do you mean the cartoon or the live action movie?
I am referring to the Disney animated classic.
Why is that your favorite movie?
I like the story and I admire the character named Belle.
What about Belle do you admire?
I admire her courage. She was willing to put her life on the line for her father.
Do you think that her courage was just out of love for her father or was she also curious about the castle?
I suppose that she was curious about the castle. She did like to read and imagine things, but I believe her father was her main concern.
Did you see the live action movie that was recently released?
Yes, but I don't think it was as good as the animated movie.
Why not?
Well, for one thing the live action movie had a whole bunch of mixed up time periods. The set design and costuming was like the 1800's but they talked about the plague which was definitely before the 1800's.
I noticed that too. Did you notice that there were several interracial couples in the live action movie?
Yes, actually I did notice that. Did you like the live action movie better than the animated one?
No, I prefer the animated movie but I am not a huge fan of Beauty and The Beast.
What about it don't you like?
I don't like the reminder that people can be so cruel to only focus on outward appearances.
I don't like it that people do that either but it is often the truth in real life. That is very sad to me.
