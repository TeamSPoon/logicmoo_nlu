Do you want to go to The Phish show later?
I had no idea they were playing.
Yeah tickets are still on sale.
I haven't really listened to them much.
They're not bad, very rock and psychadelic.
Kind of like the grateful dead?
Yeah! Just a little heavier.
Wow that sounds really cool.
Here listen to this song by them.
What's this one called.
This one is called Farmhouse.
It sounds really mellow.
Yeah this is one of the lighter ones.
It's actually not too bad.
Yeah I think you'd get into their other stuff.
Okay yeah! I'll definitely go.
Okay great! We need to get tickets soon though.
Okay let's headout now.
Alright we'll take my car.
Let's do it!
