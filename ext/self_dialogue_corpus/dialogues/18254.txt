Do you remember Bon Jovi?
Bon Jovi?  How can anyone forget them?
They haven't been relevant for about 20 years though.
They're still around, but no, they're not exactly popular anymore.
There's no bands from the 80's or 90's that people really care about these days.
It's hard to stay on top because nobody plays rock anymore.
What was your favorite song by them?
That's tough, they had many good ones.
So if you were to pick one, what would it be?
Probably Wanted Dead or Alive.
Interesting choice.  I would go for Living on a Prayer.
The reason I said that song is because of the album.
What do you mean?
I really liked the Young Guns movies and the whole Blaze of Glory soundtrack thing.
That was more Jon Bon Jovi than Bon Jovi though.
It's all the same really, don't you think?
Just saying.  The music is good either way.
I wish he would have written more soundtracks.
Never too late to start!
For him and them, it is!
