Tame Impala is really changing the game
You think?
Yeah, they're the first people to really do psychadellic rock right since the 60's
Yikes, that's a harsh accusation.
I'm serious! Sure, there's Jake Bugg and Mac Demarco, but you can't really trip to them.
Yeah, I guess they're more of a vibe.
Right? So, Tame Impala is doing it.
I'm hoping it'll open the door to more psych music.
Me too, my man. Childish Gambino's latest album shows that it will.
You're right! It was crazy to hear him make a rock album.
