Who was the best Batman in your opinion?
I would say Michael Keaton?
Wow just dismissing Christian Bale?
He was great but I loved Keaton.
How about Adam West.
It was a different time so no
He was pretty good and gave it a humanized voice.
Yeah but it was just in sitcoms.
I think Bale was definitely a great one.
His voice got irritating sometimes
