Have you heard the new Nightwish CD?
Yeah, I just got it!
What do you think of it?
It's good, but different.
I think that's because they got a new lead singer.
I was unaware.
They fired Tarja.
Do you know why?
Artistic differences I suppose.
So who is the new chick?
I'm not sure, I'll have to google her.
Her voice isn't as controlled as the previous singer.
I agree, she's not as good.
She's good, just not as good as Tarja.
Yeah Tarja is amazing.
I wonder what she is up to now?
She has a solo career.
That's cool, I'll check her out.
You should, she's amazing.
Thanks for letting me know.
