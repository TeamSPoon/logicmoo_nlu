Have you seen any good movies recently?
Yeah I just saw Guardians of the Galaxy 2!
Oh it's out already?
Yeah man, it came out on May 5th!
Do you like that genre? The action-comedy stuff?
Usually, some movies I don't care too much for. I just love space movies!
So you're a Star Wars nerd too?
Oh yeah, I can't wait for The Last Jedi to come out!
When does that one come out?
It'll be out on December 15, 2017!
oh cool. Maybe I'll see it, I'm more into thrillers though.
Oh, so whats your favorite thriller movie?
I really liked Creep and Nocturnal Animals.
Oh, those both sound scary.
They can be, but the genre's not all about being scary
It's not about horror and gore?
Very rarely, in my experience, do they have gore.
Oh that's nice. What defines a thriller then?
It's just the suspense and mystery that make your skin crawl.
Oh, I actually do love the creepy mysteries now I think about it!
