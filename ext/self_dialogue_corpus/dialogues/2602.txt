Do you think Dak Prescott is for real?
What reason do I have to think otherwise?
The fact that he had all those guys behind him.
Like who?
Dez and Zeke for starters.
I still think they could have been made better by Dak
Well the sophmore year can be the most telling
Do you think he does dip?
His numbers were pretty good
its hard to repeat them
what about elliot
he is sure to have a come down year
yeah its not sustainable what he does and did
Yeah running backs cant run like that
i agree with you on that one
I dont know though, its tough to tell with the elite ones
Look what happened to Todd Gurley
Yeah hes a great example
And you saw what drop Shaun Alexander had
I forgot about him for a minute
