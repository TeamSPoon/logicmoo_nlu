Did you see The Empire Strikes Back when it first came out?
I did! It was a huge cliff-hanger.
I can't imagine having to wait all that time to find out what happened to Han.
It was really hard! I figured he'd get rescued, but I wasn't sure how.
What did you think about the Han and Leia romance?
Oh, I thought that was great. They're such a feisty couple.
I also liked Luke training with Yoda. Yoda's so funny!
He is, and it was great getting to see Luke really becoming a Jedi knight.
But I'm glad that I can go straight to the next movie to see the happy ending!
Lucky you! I had to wait three years for the next installment.
