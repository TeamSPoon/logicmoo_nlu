Do you like music from the 90's?
I grew up back then so of course!
I remember when I would listen to the radio and try to record myself singing.
What were some of your faves?
I loved of course the boy bands like Nsync and Backstreet Boys. I also liked Christina Aguilera.
Yes I really loved her "Genie in a Bottle."
Oh me too! It feels like a classic now.
I can't wait to irritate my kids with my 90's music.
Mine listen to all kinds of music that I play for them
Do you remember Salt n Peppa?
You mean that song "Push It"? Yes I loved it!
They were classic as well.
One of my faves was Missy Elliot. You don't hear music like hers these days.
No you really don't
Remember her music videos? She always had kids dancing.
Yes it was pretty cool!
I need to add more music to my playlist on my phone.
More 90's music you mean?
Yes!! They don't make music like they used to anymore.
I wish they did, but you're right.
