I was listening to the radio today.  They had a list of the best coaches for the Saints.
The football team?
Yeah, they had a list of the top five.
I'm sure Sean Peyton was at the top of the list.
I was guessing the same.
You mean you didn't listen?
I got out the car before they mentioned a single name.
Wow.  I would have stayed in the car to hear that!
Well, they said it would be online.  And they kind of alluded that Payton would be topping the list.
I wonder who the other coaches were.
The first name that came to my mind was Mike Ditka.
Yeah, I was thinking him and Jim Mora.
I don't know if that might have been because they coached when we were growing up though.
It could be, but they both did pretty decently.
Yeah, but only Payton went all the way.
Yeah, you're right.
Who else did Ditka coach?
I'm pretty sure it was Chicago you are thinking of.
Yeah, that's it.  It was the bears.
I think most of the other coaches coached other teams too.
