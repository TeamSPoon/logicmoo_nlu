Have you seen the new Prates of the Caribean movie?
No, I have not had the chance to check it out yet. Was it good?
Yes I think it was good but there were also some things that I did not like.
What did you not like?
Well, they made Jack different in this movie!
How so?
They made him more ditzy and he did not seem as hardcore as he once was.
Oh man, that is disappointing.
I think they are experiencing franchise fatigue.
I heard that this was the last one in the series, right?
Thats what I heard too, but there was actually a sneak peak to what looks like another movie after the credits.
What was the sneak peak.
It was something to do with the tentacle guy again.  He was after Will.
That seems stupid, it should just end.
Yeah, I doubt they will do it though unless this movie gets a great response.
As long as they are still good I will continue to see the movies.
Was the new villain as cool as he looked in the trailer.
Yes, he was awesome, but spoke a little bit too much spanish.
Can you understand him.
Most of the time, yes.
