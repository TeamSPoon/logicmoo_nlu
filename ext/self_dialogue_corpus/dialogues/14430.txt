What do you think about this years playoffs?
Eh, not that good.
Why don't you think so? Its okay
Eh, just no real competition.
Yea, you do have a point about that. Lots of blowouts are happening.
Yea, the Celtics are the best team in the East and look at them.
Well, "best" is relative.
What do you mean?
Well, we all know the Cavaliers are better.
Well, they do have the best player in the world.
Yea, that helps a little bit, but Kyrie doesn't hurt either.
Even the West has no competition though.
What am I gonna watch? The spurs lose by 40?
Yea, that isnt usual for them.
Who can beat Golden State for 48 minutes 4 times out of 7?
Nobody, thats the problem.
Then why watch is my argument.
Yea, I completely agree with that one.
We just need more competition next year.
That we do. We'll see what happens.
