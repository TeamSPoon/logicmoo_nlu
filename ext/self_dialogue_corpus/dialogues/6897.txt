Did you ever watch Mulan?
Yes, I watched Mulan years ago.
I wanted to be just like Mulan when I grew up. I wanted to be tough and pretty like she was.
Yes, but it was Eddie Murphy doing the part of Mushu that really made the show.
He was so funny and when he broke the head of the Great Dragon, I laughed till I cried.
Yes, his job was to try to help bring honor to the family but he did not always help her.
No, remember the scene where he was "helping" Mulan think up a name for herself.
Yes, and Chi-Fu makes the comment about no wonder General Li never spoke of a son.
I did like the part where she finally figured out how to climb to the top of the pole.
That was the part that showed that intelligence could play more of a role than just physical toughness.
