Have you seen the new Carolina Panthers workout video?
The one with all of the new rookies?
Yeah. It got me pumped for the season.
Me too, I can't wait to see how everybody is going to play.
Same here. Who do you think is going to be good?
I think Christian McCaffrey is already good and is promising.
Yeah, he is quick. He will be good as long as he can stay healthy.
Yes. Talking about health, did you watch the documentary on Calvin Johnson?
No. What was it about?
He was talking about his football career and how he had issues staying healthy.
What did he say about it?
He was explaining that he was on painkillers for a long time and that he was having issues waking up.
Wow. That is kind of the nature of the game.
It is sad to see that occur to people who love the game so much.
Exactly. Do you think Marshawn Lynch will stay healthy?
I believe that he will. He is a strong guy.
He has been training pretty hard in the off-season to get ready for next year.
Yeah. I wonder if he still eats Skittles.
He probably does. Did he ever get an endorsement or contract with them?
I'm really not sure. If not, I sure do hope he does this time.
