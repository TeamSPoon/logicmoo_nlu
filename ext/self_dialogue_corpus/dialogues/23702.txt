How do you feel about animated movies?
Oh boy. To be honest, I can't remember the last animated movie I've watched.
I've been watching a few lately with my family, and I've found some of them to actually be pretty good.
Odds are I won't know much about them. The last good animated movie I remember watching is Up.
At least that movie was good.
"Good" doesn't do that movie justice. It was fantastic!
Hard to argue with that. Such a good story being told in that movie.
I also remember Wall-E being a really great movie.
I don't think I remember too much about that one, if I'm being honest.
Watch it if you get the chance. It's just as good as Up, if not better.
Well, back to what I had said. I've been watching some newer animated movies lately with my family.
Right, sorry about cutting you off. Do you have any recommendations.
Absolutely! For starters, Big Hero 6 is pretty fun.
Isn't that a Marvel movie?
Yes it is! It's a much different take on your typical Marvel movie, or just superhero movie in general, though.
Okay, I'm interested. What else?
Finding Dory is also a fantastic movie.
I forgot that they even made a Finding Nemo sequel! Please tell me it's good.
Like I just said, it's fantastic. If you get the chance, definitely watch it.
I actually think it's on Netflix! Well, I know what I'm doing tonight!
