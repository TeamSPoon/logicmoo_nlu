Who is your favorite Beatles member?
That is hard! It's a debate between Paul and John.
What about George? I feel like he's underrated, his solo songs are excellent?
True, what is your favorite solo song by George Harrison?
I've Got My Mind Set On You, for sure!
Me too! What is that other religious song he sang?
My Sweet Lord, love that one too!
Yes! Now that I think about it, he's kind of an outcast from the other members in his beliefs.
He is, that's why he's my favorite.
His songs seem to have more substance than the others when they went solo.
