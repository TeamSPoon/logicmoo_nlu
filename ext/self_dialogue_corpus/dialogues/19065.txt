What are you listening to lately?
I've been a big Pink Floyd kick.
You know, the president of the Pink Floyd fan club used to visit the library I worked at.
Really?
Yeah, he was doing research on them for a book he was writing.
That's really cool. Did he tell you anything unusual about them?
Not much that I remember. He had a lot of Dark Side of the Moon T-shirts.
I love that album!
What's your favorite song on it?
I really like money.
Hmm. I prefer Eclipse.
It's hard to go wrong; they're both great songs.
They are. Is Dark Side of the Moon mostly what you've been listening to?
It's mostly that and The Wall.
Ah, yeah, it's hard to go wrong there either.
I don't know why, but I can listen to it over and over again.
There are some albums that are just like that. They never get old.
The Beatles are like that for me sometimes too.
Hmm. I'll have to give some of these another shot next time I'm working out.
I hope you do!
