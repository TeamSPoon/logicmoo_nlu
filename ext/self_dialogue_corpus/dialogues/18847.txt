I love Dave Grohl! He is so good at drumming!
He really is. What did you like him in?
He was great in Nirvana!
Yes he was. He was also good in Foo Fighters.
I forgot about them! What a cool band.
They are. I prefer his drumming though.
Same here. That is why I listen to Nirvana much more.
Have you ever heard of Queens of the Stone Age?
No I have not. Who are they?
They are a band fronted by Josh Homme.
Cool, but what does this have to do with Dave Grohl.
Dave Grohl drummed for them on one album.
Cool. Which album is it?
It is called Songs For The Deaf.
That is such a creative name. I love them already.
They are great. There are so many good songs on there.
What is a good one?
Check out First It Giveth.
Awesome. So Dave Grohl is good on this?
He is. Just listen to the song and you will hear what I am saying.
