Did you ever see the latest Iron Man?
The 3rd one?
Yes that one
Yeah I saw it
How did you feel about it?
I think Robert Downey Jr did a good job
I thought it was boring
No way I think that they are all sort of the same, with different villains
I hate how you are shown that the hero may die.
Yeah thats typical in these comic type films.
I wish someone would break the rules.
Suicide Squad tried to
But even they made you feel bad for the bad guys
Isnt that a good thing?
No I think its a bit generic
No way!
I didnt want to empathize with guys who do bad things
What about Deadpool
I think hes just a dark comedic hero
I think he is supposed to be bad but Ryan Reynolds makes him funny
