Have you seen the movie Life?
Is that the space movie with the alien?
Yea, there was a ton of ads for it pretty recently.
I have not, but it looked interesting, have you?
Yea, I just watched it last night.
What did you think of it?
It was fine, there was some silly stuff but it is pretty action packed.
How well did they do the aliens, that is usually the deal breaker for me.
It was actually done pretty well, it was kind of like an octopus or something?
With tentacles?  Like in Arrival?
Kind of like that but you could actually see its physical body.
That sounds alright to me.
You should check it out, it is not a great movie but I think you will enjoy it.
I plan on it, just too many movies in the queue.
What else are you trying to watch?
I still haven't seen either of the new Star Wars, or Logan.
All those are great, I would recommend those more.
Which of the three should I watch next?
I would say Logan.
Alright, thanks for the recommendations.
