Hey man, are you ready for football this season?
I've missed football so much since it's been gone!
I know, it's not the same without it.
Who are you looking to win it all?
I think the Pats will be good again this year.
What do you think about the Kansas City Chiefs?
I think they'll take a step back since a few key players are gone now.
Yeah, that's probably right.
I also don't think Alex Smith can take them all the way.
He's just way too average, I agree.
Who do you root for?
I am an Oakland Raiders Fan!
I think the Raiders are really up and coming.
Derek Carr is a beast!
Yeah and they even have beast mode now!
Oh yeah, I forget Lynch is on their team now.
He's amazing.
I hope the year off won't hurt him.
This year should be interesting!
It always is!
