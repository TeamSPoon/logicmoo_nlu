The x-men movies were good, don't you think?
Yea, the 1st one was a classic
Who's your favoirte x-men?
I'd say professor x
I like cyclops, he reminds me of myself with glasses.
They all have cool powers
Especially magneto, when he makes steps with his metal powers.
That is a really cool way to move around.
And you can't forget about Mystique, who can be anyone she wants.
And she is a really good actor.
