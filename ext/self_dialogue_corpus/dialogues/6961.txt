Did you see the movie The Princess and the Frog?
No, never heard of it.
The Disney movie, you never heard of it?
No. Is it an old one?
Not even ten years old.
Well, I had boys. No girls to watch princess movies.
It was a cute musical. Took place in New Orleans.
Really, that's a new concept.
Yes, the music and setting for the movie was really a different idea for a change.
Not set out in a castle in the woods. Maybe someday I'll see it.
