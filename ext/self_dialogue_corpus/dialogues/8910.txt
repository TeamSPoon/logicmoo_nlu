Random question, greatest rock guitarist in history?
Jimi Hendrix.
Meh.
You don't like Hendrix. He pretty much started the rock guitar solo.
Granted. He was a good guitar player. Maybe I'll give you that one but he wasn't much of a performer.
So who are you thinking of?
Eddie Van Halen. Eric Clapton.
Clapton is good. Possibly one of the best ever but he learned everything he knows from Hendrix.
And Van Halen?
Learned everything he knows from Clapton. HA!
