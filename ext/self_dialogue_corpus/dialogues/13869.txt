Do you have a favorite Lady Gaga album?
Oh, definitely 'The Fame Monster'.
Does that have 'Bad Romance' on it?
Yes! In my opinion that's easily her best song.
I agree. What other singles are from that album?
'Alejandro' and 'Telephone', with Beyonce.
Oh yeah, and then Lady Gaga was on Beyonce's 'Video Phone'.
That's right! They were both great pop songs.
I'd say that's my favorite album too, then.
It's an easy decision. A great pop album.
