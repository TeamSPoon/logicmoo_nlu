Have you seen that kids movie Sing?
No I haven't yet, but it looked cute. Did you?
Yeah I did, I watched it with my son the other night.
What did you think of it?
It was really cute. There's a ton of music and singing.
Do you think Annie would like it?
Yeah, it's perfect for young kids.
Awesome, I'll have to rent that this weekend
Definitely, you won't be disappointed.
Cool, thanks for letting me know.
No problem, you'll have to let me know how much she likes it.
Will do. We might also rent Secret Life of Pets
Don't bother with that movie, it starts off really cute, but it's turns really dark.
Oh really, how so?
In the middle of the movie when two of the pets get lost in the city they get captured by pets who take about killing humans.
Seriously? That's a children's movie?
Yeah, we were shocked, we ended up turning it off because we didn't want Johnny watching it.
Yeah no doubt, well I guess we'll skip that. That's not appropriate at all.
No definitely not. Just stick with Sing.
Yeah that's the going to be the plan, thanks!
