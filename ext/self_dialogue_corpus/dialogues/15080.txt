Comedies are probably my favorite genre.
I get that. They're light and don't have too much violence or upsetting stuff.
I don't like to watch violence.
So which comedies do you like?
Adam Sandler ones, Jack Black ones, stuff like that.
Jim Cary?
No, he's obnoxious.
I actually think that too.
I thought it was just me.
Nope. He is.
