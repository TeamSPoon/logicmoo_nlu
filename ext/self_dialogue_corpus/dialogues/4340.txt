What did you think of Insomnia?
Awesome movie.  Makes me want to visit Alaska.
That would be nuts to have that much daylight in a given day.
What I really appreciated was Robin Williams in the film.
It was weird to see him as a villain.  I think of him as Mrs. Doubtfire.
It was kind of cool to see him in a different role though.
It was a good ending though.
Yeah, sad, but was the appropriate one.
Christopher Nolan hasn't made a bad movie yet.
And this definitely isn't one.
