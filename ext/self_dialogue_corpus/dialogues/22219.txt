Have you seen any of the Rocky movies?
Of course, they are classics.
Which one is your favorite?
I love the one with the russian. Can't keep track of which numbered movies they are but that was great.
Yes, I like the way the show how Rocky trains the old style way and the russian boxer uses technology.
Yea, just shows how the new ways aren't always better.
My least favorite I think is with Mr. T.
Yea, that one was okay.
I will say though that the first Rocky, really led the way for them all.
Yes that was a classic.
Introducing each character like Pauly, Mickey and Adreinne.
Yea Rocky seemed like such a dummy in that one, but seems to show he's not as the movies went on.
Yes and his wife really changed.
Yea, I thought she was pretty, even in the beginning.
Yea, Appollo Creed was good too.
I liked him too and then how they became friends.
When Appollo died it was sadder then when Mickey did.
I think so too.
Sylvester Stallone has a lot of great movies.
Yes, he's one of my favorites.
