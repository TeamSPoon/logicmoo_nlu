Do you think the Beatles deserve to be considered great composers, along with Beethoven and the like?
Well, it's funny because just today I was watching an interview where Paul McCartney said that classical composers were the pop artists of their day.
That's interesting to think about, yeah. And the Beatles helped the public see that.
Yeah, the obvious artistic quality of their music really helped the public rethink pop music in a big way.
It's true! Though they also created a kind of false dichotomy, I think.
You mean between "Serious Pop" and "Lightweight Pop," right?
Yeah, exactly. Because people today still love to trash artists like Justin Bieber, comparing him to the Beatles.
Well, his music doesn't seem too conceptually ambitious, to be fair. The Beatles just kept pushing things forward, artistically.
Yeah, when you look at how far they progressed since about 1963 to 1967 or 1968...
Totally! The leap from "Love Me Do" to the White Album is incredible.
