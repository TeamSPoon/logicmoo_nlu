I heard 'Hakuna Matata' the other day and was reminded of how much I loved 'The Lion King.'
One of my favorite Disney movies of all time.
That scene with Mufasa's death was very powerful.
Did you know the movie got four Golden Globe and Oscar nominations?
That doesn't surprise me.  If anything, I would expect more.
Also, thinking about it, the movie was Disney's version of 'Hamlet.'
A great point.  Both are about a prince whose father is killed by the uncle, and then is exiled.
And he comes back later and reclaims his throne.
The fact that a children's movie has parallels to literary classics is very cool to me.
It was incredibly well done and complex.  I wish more children's movies were like 'The Lion King.'
