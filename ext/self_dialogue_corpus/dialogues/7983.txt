Honestly, I really like pop music! People bash on it, but it's just light and fun.
True! It's nice to just have something to put on in the background.
Yeah, I know what you mean. I can't stop listening to Taylor Swift's new stuff.
Haha, I guess she is pop now, isn't she?
For sure. But Bad Blood is so good.
And Blank Space is great too!
They've both got this sort of angry energy. It makes me get so pumped up!
Yeah, that's a good feeling. I also like slower stuff.
Like what?
Ed Sheeran is really relaxing to me. I just love his voice, it's so soft and mellow.
