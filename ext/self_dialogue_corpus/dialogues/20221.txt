What are some movies with good music, that are not really musicals?
I think Guardians of The Galaxy has some great songs.
The whole soundtrack was amazing, as was the film.
There is also, O Brother Where Art Thou.
Who was in that one?
It has George Clooney and Helen Hunt in it.
Is that the one taking place around the great depression?
Yes, have you seen it?
Years ago.
It had some great songs, most of them were original.
I recall it having a lot, was it not a musical movie?
No, they did sing a lot.
What are some other non-musical movies that have good songs?
Pulp Fiction has some amazing songs.
I like the way that song shows up, the odd feel.
The music played into that really well.
I loved Samuel L. Jackson in that movie.
He was so funny, and kind of scary.
I loved the way he and John Travolta played on one another.
And Uma Thurman, her dancing was a really cool but.
