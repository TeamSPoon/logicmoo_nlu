Did you see that new comedy Fist Fight?
No, I haven't got a chance yet.  Who is in that?
Its got Charlie Day and Ice Cube.
Oh yeah,  I saw the trailers for that.  Looked pretty funny.
It was ok, not the funniest thing ever.
A lot of comedies coming out now seem kind of stupid.
The last one I really laughed at in the theater was The Heat.
That's the one with Sandra Bullock?
Yeah, her and Melissa McCarthy.
She has gone downhill though.  A lot of her movies aren't funny anymore.
