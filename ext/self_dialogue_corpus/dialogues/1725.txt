How many NFL teams are there?
That's a pretty basic question. I take it you aren't much of a fan.
Not really. I'll watch occassionally but I don't know much about it.
There are 32 teams split between two conferences and eight divisions.
That sounds complicated.
Not really. Each division has four teams and the Super Bowl is played by the two conference champions.
That makes sense I guess. So do the teams in the conference just play each other?
No. They all play across conferences, but each team plays the other three in their division twice.
How many games do they play in a season?
The regular season before playoffs is 16 games.
Oh, so six of the sixteen are from the same division, right?
Yes and the other ten are set by the NFL. There is a formula they follow to make sure each team plays every other at least once every four years.
That is really impressive. What does the formula look at?
There are a lot things. Way too hard to explain succinctly, but it ends up being 12 conference games and 4 non-conference games.
It is too bad they can't all play each other.
Well, that would double the season. I don't think that would work well for anyone.
Fans might like year round football.
In theory. But it would cause so many more injuries and players would burn out a lot faster.
That's true. I guess it wouldn't work.
As much as I love football, it is nice to have something to look forward to in August rather than watching all the time.
