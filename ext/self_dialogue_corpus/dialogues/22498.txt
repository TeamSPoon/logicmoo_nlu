Hey, did you see the new Robert Langdon movie? I rented it On Demand last night.
Inferno? Yes I saw it when it first came out in theaters.
What did you think of it? Did you like it?
I didn't think it was as great as the others. So much was left out of the book or changed.
Well, that's Hollywood for you. The book is really thick, they can't fit all of that in a two hour movie.
It isn't just that. The ending was changed, and it completely transformed the meaning of the movie as well as the book.
I didn't read the book, what was the different ending about?
I'll tell you but I don't want to spoil it for you, if you're going to read the book later.
I just saw the movie. Why would I bother reading the book when I know all the essential details?
Like I just said, the book is an entirely different beast with a completely different ending.
So tell me about it.
Okay, you asked for it. For one thing, you know how at the end of the movie they stop the virus from being released on humanity?
Yes, I remember that.
Well in the book, they don't actually stop the virus. The plague is unleashed on mankind.
Wow, so you mean the world ends?
No, not at all. That's another thing. In the movie, the plague is a deadly virus that destroys the world as we know it.
So in the book it's not deadly?
Not at all. Nobody dies, and in fact only a small percentage of humanity contracts the virus.
What is the virus then?
Infertility. It renders just enough of the population unable to reproduce, enough to solve the world's population problem..
