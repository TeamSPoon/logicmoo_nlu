You ever been to a Budweiser Superfest?
Man, hell yeah. You ain't said nothing.
I remember when I was a teenager, they had it at Veteran's Stadium in Philadelphia.
That was like the late eighties right?
Yeah. We saw New Edition, Morris Day and the Time. Patti Labelle.
Don't forget Luther Vandross.
How you know Luther was there?
Because I was there. I was like seventeen. He was the closing act and blew the roof of with A House is A home.
You absolutely right. That was the same year that Morris Day had The Bird.
America, have you heard? There's a brand new dance, and it's called the bird...
I know right. I think Sheila E and Price were also on that ticket.
You are so right. After Prince performed, he left the stage, the stadium, and the city.
I know Patti Labelle stuck around. She came on stage with Luther for one of his songs.
That was only right. You know Patti from Philly.
You know I know. Who else was there?
I remember New Edition with Bobby Brown. They did like five or six songs.
Man, I remember that like it was yesterday.
I know right. No way you gone get that many acts on one ticket ever again.
That concert started at twelve noon and we were out there til after midnight.
And I stayed there with my parents for every performance.
