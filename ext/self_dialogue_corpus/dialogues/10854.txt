I used to hate the Fast and the Furious movies but now I love them.
Really why?
I just didn't understand what was happening.
Makes sense. I think they're so cool!
Yeah I went back and rewatched them all. Now I'm obsessed.
Me too. I love Fast 5
Fast 5 is my favorite ! The characters are great and it's so action packed.
I agree. Plus the team makes the movie. With that switch at the end.
I know I was so mind blown.
It was genius that they got all that money.
