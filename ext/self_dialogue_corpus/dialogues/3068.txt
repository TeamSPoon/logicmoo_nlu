NFL football is my favorite sport
What do you like about it?
I love throwing my support behind a team.
What do you like about the sport?
I love how organized it is and how at any moment a big pass or big run can happen.
I agree those are thrilling moments.
What is your favorite sport?
My favorite is NFL football too.
I plan on going to the Superbowl this year if Tampa Bay makes an appearance.
So you are a Tampa Bay fan?
I have been for the last few years. What about you?
I grew up a Miami Dolphins fan.
I am glad Nick Saban gave up the Dolphins to come back to coaching college football.
If he had stuck around he could have made something of Miami.
The Dolphins haven't been relevant in years
Alright alright enough trash talking.
Now I am fired up for the season. Trash talking is one of the best parts of being a fan.
Do you play fantasy football?
Of course I do!
Want to join my league?
