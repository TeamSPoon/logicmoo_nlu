What's your favorite genre of movies?
I love a good gangster movie.  Do you like those as well?
Yeah, I love a good mob movie.  What's your favorite mob movie them?
Well how can you go against The Godfather?
I agree.  Part 1 or Part 2 though?
Well I am an original, so I will stick with Part 1.  How about you?
I like both really, that's one heck of an evening for sure.
When you look at the cast list for those movies, it is absolutely amazing.  Did you have a favorite performance?
Well the obvious answer would be Al Pacino, but I was always partial to the hotheaded Sonny, played brilliantly by James Caan.
He certainly did go out in a spectacular way.  My favorite was Mr. Cool - Robert Duvall as Tom Hayden.
Geez, I almost forgot about him and how great he was in that movie.   How about the Scorsese mob movies, you a fan of those?
Oh absolutely, more so of GoodFellas though.  Ray Liotta was great in that movie, and Joe Pesci was unforgettable.
Not a big fan though of Casino - how come?
Well I did enjoy Casino a lot.  I just found the Sharon Stone/James Woods storyline to be annoying.
I do agree with that.  Can you believe she won an Oscar for that role?
Well her performance was fine I guess, it was just the character that so damn annoying.
You do have a point there.  But once again Joe Pesci ruled the day.
And nobody dies quite like Joe Pesci in a good mob movie.  Remember when he go it in the back of the head in GoodFellas?
Oh yes, that was quite startling when I first saw it.  But beaten with baseball bats and buried in a cornfield in Casino was pretty good too.
Oh I forgotten about that.  That was great, but I think I had blocked it out of my mind from seeing Pesci in his tidy whities.  LOL
