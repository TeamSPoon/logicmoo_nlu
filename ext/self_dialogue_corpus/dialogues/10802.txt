Have you ever seen any of the Fast & Furious movies?
Yeah, they are awesome action films. I love Vin Diesel.
And I really admire how they do their car stunts live, they don't just lay back and do the whole thing with CGI.
It takes a lot of effort to do movies the old fashioned way, with special effects and stunts on the set. Props to them for that.
Yes, I saw an interview with the cast, and they were really proud of what they achieved on set.
I didn't know how they were going to handle Paul Walker's death, may he rest in peace.
Yeah, as I watched that last film he was in, I kept waiting for the character to get killed off.
I absolutely loved that they fashioned a happy ending for him, and he didn't die, he just kind of rode off into the sunset with his family.
I agree, that was the best possible ending for that character, and a terrific sendoff for Paul Walker.
I didn't expect it, and it is one of my favorite endings of any film. It gave me chills.
