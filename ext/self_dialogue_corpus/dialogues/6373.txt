Do you like animals and Disney movies?
I don't, but my children do.
Have they seen Bambi?
Yes, my daughter especially loves that film.
It is my daughters favorite movie too!
I think next time our daughters have a play date, Bambi is to film to play!
Do you have a Blue Ray player?
No, unfortunately not.
I will bring my Blue Ray player with a copy of Bambi on Blue Ray next time our children get together.
Thank you so much, they would really love that!
