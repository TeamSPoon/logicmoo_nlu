Dude, what's up with the Bears?
Not sure what you mean.
They may have made the dumbest draft pick ever.
You mean the QB they drafted?
Yeah, Mitch Trubisky.
Why was it a dumb pick?
They traded up for this guy.
Right, so?
They gave up a ton of draft capital for someone who has one season as a starter.
Yeah, but that doesn't make him a bad pick.
But why draft him when you had Mike Glennon?
Glennon's not that good.
Agreed, but Chicago is dumb enough to pay him $15 million a year to sit on the bench.
It was a bit strange, but you need a good backup QB.
Either way, no matter who starts, that old saying about quarterbacks is how I think of them.
What old saying?
"If you've got two quarterbacks, you've got none."
That's a weird saying.
Basically means that you don't have a franchise QB if you can't decide on who's better.
Than you trade one of them for a bevy of draft picks.
