Wow, this beat is sick.
You like it?
Yeah, what are we listening to?
Believe it or not this is DJ jazzy jeff.
Wait, fresh prince?
The freshest!
Its.....not bad actually.
I know! Its a classic and totally overlooked.
Its so weird to hear will smith doing music, I only think of him as an actor these days.
Back in the day he put out some fierce tunes!
Yeah I dont usually listen to throwbacks.
You gotta unwind with the classics sometimes you know.
I guess so. Do you always play stuff like this?
My tastes are pretty eclectic, really.
Do you have any other recommendations for me?
Of course! I suggest listening to the classic hip hop station on pandora.
You think that will be like this?
Definitely, you'll find something you like for sure.
Well thanks so much! Can't wait to listen.
No problem.
