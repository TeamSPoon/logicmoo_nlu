Nirvana was the Beatles of the 90s generation.
Yes, Kurt Cobain was their John Lennon.
I wonder if we will see a popular band like that again in our lifetimes?
I'm not sure, it seems like people don't have the patience for bands and albums anymore.
Yes, and all bands seem to have a hard time making new fans.
That's right. Music seems a lot more fragmented these days.
Could it be that consumers are more interested in solo artist?
Yes, that's possible. It seems like we are a more self-driven society.
The concept of people working together doesn't seem to be appealing to most people anymore
I think social media has something to do with that.
