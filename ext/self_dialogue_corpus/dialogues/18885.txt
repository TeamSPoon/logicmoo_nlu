How do you usually listen to your music?
I like to just play Youtube on my phone with headphones. How do you?
I have a playlist that I keep on my phone. I usually just listen in the car or at the gym.
What kind of music do you like?
It depends on my mood. I like most of the pop hits. And I like to listen to fast paced techno at the gym or when running.
Me too, I usually listen to pop music but lately I have been listening to stereotronique playlists on youtube when I am working on something that needs to get done quickly.
I have been thinking about checking out pandora.
I would recommend it, it is great.
I think the days of people buying cd's is pretty much over.
I know, i haven't bought a cd since the 90's.
Yeah i think everything is streamed or downloaded now.
I still like to listen to music on the radio though, that is the only way to find new music.
Yeah. I sometimes still like to watch the countdown on vh1 on the weekends.
They still do that? I forgot about that.
Yeah, it is weird, they don't even play music on MTv that often anymore.
I think that is the best part of a song, is being able to watch the video along with it.
Have you ever watched one of those videos called "Try not to dance"?
Yes, I love to watch those.
I can never resist dancing when I watch those.
Yeah, music always puts me in a better mood.
