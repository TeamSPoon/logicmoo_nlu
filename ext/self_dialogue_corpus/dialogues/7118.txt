Did you like the recent Beauty and the Beast movie or did you like Cinderella more?
I liked Cinderella more. I felt there was more heart.
I thought both were realy fun entertaining movies. Beauty and the Beast starred Emma Watson and had really good musical pieces.
I enjoyed them both but I felt Cinderella had more heart. I also really enjoyed Cate Blanchett's performance as the wicked step mother.
I'm a huge Lily James fan now because of Cinderella, but Emma Watson will always be my favorite.
I know you're a huge Emma fan, but Lily James gave a more sympathetic performance.
I think that has more to do with the character of Cinderella. She's just more sympathetic as a whole.
She did lose her parents and had to succumb to such wickedness from her step mother and step sisters.
Right, while Belle was kind of snobby being intellectually superior to her village. The CGI in Beauty and the Beast was definitely fantastic.
I thought both did a wonderful job. Don't forget about Fairy God Mother's transformations of the farm items into the carriage and all the magic she used!
