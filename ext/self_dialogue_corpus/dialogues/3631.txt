I have mixed feelings about The Usual Suspects.
Why?
It's a fun movie at all, very engaging.
Yeah, Kevin Spacey is great and it's one of his first.
It's just kind of underwhelming.
WHy?
There's a ton of build-up, and he walks away and it makes sense, but I just didn't care.
Hmm, I liked it. It worked for me.
Favorite moment?
Probably when I saw it coming about 10 minutes ahead of time. That or the lineup where they're all just kidding around.
