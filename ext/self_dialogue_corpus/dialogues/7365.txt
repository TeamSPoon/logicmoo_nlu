Do you like Black Panther?
I do, Its one of my favorite Marvel heroes.
And did you know about hes upcoming movie?
I did actually but im not sure when its coming to theaters.
I heard it was coming our next year so theres still a bit of time left.
I liked Black PantherÂ´s introduction in the las Captain America movie.
Yeah he was pretty cool and with good fighting moves.
I loved the ending scene where you can see hes home.
I liked that part as well I thought it was a good element to spice things up for the movie.
I liked the costume the most, it was pretty good.
