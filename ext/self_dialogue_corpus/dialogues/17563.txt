Did you hear that Garth Brooks is going on tour again?
Yeah, he's touring with Trisha Yearwood, right?
Yeah, I think so.
So, are you going?
No, I'm really not interested in country music.
Really, I really had wanted to go!
Yeah, a lot of people did.
You aren't even interested?
Not really.  I just knew you listened to country music.
Yeah, he's one of my favorites.
I do hear that he does an awesome performance.
That really doesn't help.
What do you mean?
It doesn't make me feel better knowing they are sold out.
They are sold out?
Sure, I mean, it's Garth Brooks.
Yeah, but didn't tickets go on sale like yesterday?
Yeah, and they sold out by yesterday afternoon.
Wow, that's crazy.
Yeah, I hope I can win some on the radio.
