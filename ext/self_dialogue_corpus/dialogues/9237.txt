What is your favorite KISS song?
That's easy. I Was Made For Loving You.
Great song.
One of the best.
I also love God OF Thunder.
Gene Simmons is great.
He is and I love the way he becomes his demon character when he's in makeup.
I know, the way he moves his head around.
They are such a great band. So many fantastic songs.
So true.
