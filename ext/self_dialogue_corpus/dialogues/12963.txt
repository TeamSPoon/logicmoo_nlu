Does the character of C3PO need to still exist?
Yeah and I think R2D2 and him make a good duo.
They seem like they are just around now for no reason.
They offer alot in terms of the story line though.
I just think they are old characters and Star Wars needs to depart them.
I think they will but they need a bridge
For what purpose?
To connect older fans to the new Star Wars
So Luke eventually gets killed off?
I just think hes older and he has to go away
