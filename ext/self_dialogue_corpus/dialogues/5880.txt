I'm trying to decide if I should see Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales. Do you know much about it?
No, not really. I haven't seen it yet, either, but I have heard it's good.
Hey, if it has Johnny Depp in it, that's all I really need!
But is Orlando Bloom in it?
Yes, he is, but I'm not sure how big his role in it is.
I think Keira Knightley has a small role in it as well.
Any idea what the plot is about?
I think it's related to Will Turner's son somehow. Not quite sure how.
Okay. I might have to go see it then.
Hey, mind if I go with you to see it?
