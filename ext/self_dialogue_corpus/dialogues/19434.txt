Why do you think of Pearl Jam?
Who are they?
You haven't heard of them?
No I haven't?
They began in the late 80's
Really?
Yes, they are basically the pioneers of grundge rock.
I had no idea?
They are one of the few bands that have stayed true to themselves and their fans.
How so?
The lead singer, Eddie Vedder, has this sense of humility.
Really?
Yes, loyal to his family, his band, and his fans.
Very cool
Yes, he doesn't cater to the masses; he doesn't fold to the industry.
That's incredible
Yes, they produce and market everything themselves.
Rare, nowadays.
The lyrics to their songs read like poetry, not the typically stuff about drugs and women.
That's a refreshing change, I will have to look into them.
