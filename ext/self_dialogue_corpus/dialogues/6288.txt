What is your favorite Disney movie?
Lion king, it was the first movie that made me cry.
Same with me, Bambi made me cry too when his mom died.
I think realistic stories like that are important for children.
I agree, I don't like the princess stories because they are unrealistic.
I know right? If Cinderella's shoe was the perfect fit then why did it fall off?
Not only that but I don't want my daughter to believe in the knight in shining armor narrative.
I agree that narrative is bad for little girls perception of relationships.
You can't go wrong with a Pixar animation though.
Yes Pixar Disney movies have great messages in them.
