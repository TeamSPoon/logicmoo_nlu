What do you think of rock music right now?
I think the classic stuff is way better. The stuff now is awful.
Yeah, I agree, there's nothing like Bohemian Rhapsody.
I totally agree. I would take some Rolling Stones or ACDC anyday over the current music.
Yeah, although some of the bands from the 90s aren't bad.
True. I used to listen to Slipknot all the time.
They're a little too heavy for me. I prefer some classic Nirvana.
True, nothing can beat Nirvana. It's such a shame Kurt Cobain died so young.
Yeah, I totally agree. The good die young.
Better than turn into Aerosmith! They're terrible now.
