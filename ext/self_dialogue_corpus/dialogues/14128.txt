What do you think of Lady Gaga's Latest Album
I really liked it, it was so much different than her other stuff
I agree. What was your favorite song from the album
Its a tie between Joanne and A-YO
Why those song?
I think they are beautiful and have a mellow vibe about them
Did you like Million Reasons
I found it to be too overrated as a title track
What song do you wish was the title
Personally Dancin' in Circles would have been better
