Do you think you'll go see the new Transformers movie?
I'm not sure. It looks fun, but I've heard it's epically terrible.
Aren't they all kind of terrible, though?
True. Anthony Hopkins is in it, which could be fun.
I kind of lost track of the plot after the first one. I can't believe they're still making them.
I can't figure out why giant robots that could go all over the universe have so much to do with the Earth.
I think that's kind of what this new one is supposed to be about.
Really? Maybe humans made them.
Maybe they made humans!
You know what the real problem is, though? They killed off Jazz right away.
He would have made the series more fun. Fewer explosions, more story.
Well, to be fair, this one has swords, not just explosions!
I wonder what Transformers would have transformed into if they were really around in Arthurian times?
They scan stuff and copy it, right?
Yeah. So they would pick some kind of interesting piece of technology.
Maybe Starscream would have turned into the first window hinge.
Or a piece of an aqueduct leftover from the Roman Empire.
Chamberpot. Or an oil lamp.
I read that in this one, there's a robot that is someone's butler.
There may actually be no point to this movie, after all.
