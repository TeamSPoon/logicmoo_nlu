Who is Gronkowski playing for?
I don't remember.
Is it the team with the tiger mascot?
You mean the Bengals?
I think that might be it.
I thought he trained with the Rams.
I get him mixed up with Gostkowski.
Gostkowski is a kicker.
Right, what position does Gronkowski play?
Linebacker, if I remember right.
I thought he was a tight end?
He played as quarterback in college.
Which college was that?
Notre Dame.
They did really well last year.
Not as good as North Carolina.
Whose the NC coach?
I don't keep track of college football too closely.
Hodgekins came from NC.
He's a great runningback.
