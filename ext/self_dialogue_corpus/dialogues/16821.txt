Hey there what kind of music genre do you like?
Anything really, easy listening, jazz, maybe a bit of pop rock.
Oh what kind of Jazz?
Well, all kinds really but I do like the old standard ones.
Yeah me too..like Duke Ellington, Ella Fitzgerald, Keith Jarret.
Yeah the Dukes for sure and anything trio like a piano, standing bass and drums..just something really simple and soothing.
Yeah me too. I prefer a jazz trio rather than an orchestra.
Except Glenn Miller. He's good.
Yeah he is one of the masters of orchestra.
I like Natalie Cole also.
Yeah I like her album compilation, the one which she did the Unforgetable duet with her dad.
Yeah Natalie and Nat King Cole duet that's pretty awesome.
I like old standard mainstream jazz. It's relaxing and it has substance.
Yeah unlike the pop music nowadays.
I will have to say though for jazz, I like it except when listening to trumpet.
Oh yeah, why?
The trumpet usually gets noisy after a while especially when the soloist starts to improvise a lot. It's noisy.
Ah yeah true, I prefer just a simple piano myself.
I can listen to piano jazz for hours.
Me too. Piano jazz instrumental especially.
