I'm trying to think of great music from the 90's.
What do you mean exactly?
That's when I feel that the best music was out.
I kind of agree with you there but it depends on who you're referring to.
Remember TLC?
Do I? Of course I do, I loved their music!
I think "Waterfalls" was my favorite.
I think that was everyone's favorite.
Their album CrazySexyCool had so many great songs on there.
Yes it did. Remember "Red Light Special"?
Oh yes I really liked that one as well.
I also loved their album "Fan Mail."
Yes that was great! The song "Unpretty" was so well written.
I agree. What an inspiration.
And of course the classic "No Scrubs".
Well yes! Didn't you sing that to different guys?
My best friend did, she thought it was hilarious.
Did  you know that they sold over 65 million records worldwide?
Wow I had no idea!
I know but they were one of the best.
