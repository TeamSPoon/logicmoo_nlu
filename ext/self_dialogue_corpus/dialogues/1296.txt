I cannot wait for the NFL season to start.
I know. I am sick and tired of watching baseball.
Who is your pick for this year?
I am going for the Pittsburgh Steelers again.
Why would you choose the Steelers? Rothlisberger is a wash.
Yes. It is true that he is getting old. But, I believe he still have some tricks up his sleeve.
The best quarterback in the league is still Tom Brady, in my opinion.
Tom Brady is an old man there is new blood in the league and he is no longer the king of passing yards.
Ok, smart guy. Who do you think is going to be the best quarterback this year?
Is that even a question? Aaron Rodgers is the man.
Does he really have the team to produce this year?
He still has Davnte Adams who had a great year last year. So I would say so.
Did Randall Cobb get traded?
Nope. He is still a Packer.
Is Clay Matthews still on the Packers line up?
Yes. Of course he is. He is easily their best linebacker.
Even after all this Packer talk your still a Steelers man?
I will always be a Pittsburgh man.
Well with Antonio Brown and Jason Harrison its easy to see why you love the Steelers.
Yes, they are truly a one of a kind team.
