There are a lot of nice things about music.
I guess so! But what do you mean?
I think one of the neatest things is that it can encourage us to exercise.
Oh? How does it do that?
Well, I remember the first time I heard "Can't Stop the Feeling" I was in a bowling alley, and started dancing!
Ha! Did people look at you funny?
Thankfully, it was pretty empty. But it encourages us to exercise.
I guess, if you're into dancing it could.
Well, it could help even if you're out walking or running, to have a playlist that motivates you.
I walk and could use that idea.
Sure! And another thing that you can do is hula hoop.
Hula hoop? At my age?
Yes! It's very common to do nowadays, and people like to do something called hoop flow.
What's that?
It's generally hula hooping with a song playing. Then doing a routine that just comes to mind.
Not just waist hooping?
No, you do a lot of off-body moves that go along with the music.
I'll have to look into that. All of this could help me get fit more.
Yes! Music is such a good motivator for many things.
Just talking about it is motivating me right now!
