Hey!  How have you been?
Great, how are you?
I'm doing well.  I've been using my free time to watch movies lately.
Really?  I love to watch movies.
My family recently signed up for Amazon Prime so we have been enjoy the selection of movies.
What kind of movies are available?
There are movies for everyone.  Romance, comedy, action, thrillers, childrens...
Wow! which type is your favorite to watch?
I have been watching family movies with the kids lately, but really enjoy thrillers after the kids go to bed.
Any good family movies?
We watched trolls recently.
I saw that too.  Justin Timberlake did one of the voices I think.
Yes, he was the voice of "Branch."
There was a lot of great music in the movie too.
I enjoyed the movie as much as the kids I think.
It is nice when that happens and the adults don't get bored watching a movie for kids.
I agree with you.  It is always better if the adults like it too.
I will have to watch trolls now.
I will talk to you later!
Bye!  It was nice seeing you.
