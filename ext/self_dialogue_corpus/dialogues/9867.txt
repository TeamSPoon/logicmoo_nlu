Will Kanye go down as the best?
Late Registration as a great album
Things fell off around 808 and Heartbreak
The album was a departure from rap.
Right so it sounded silly.
I agree that he should have kept his focus around rap.
His personality wont be forgotten.
How about his legacy?
Might be that of a whiner.
Sure thats not what rappers get into the game for either.
