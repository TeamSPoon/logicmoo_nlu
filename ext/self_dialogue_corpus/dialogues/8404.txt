Did you like the new Calvin Harris song called Slide?
I am not sure I recognize it by name.
You would probably know it if you heard it.
Yes that is true.
It is a sweet jam.
Who else is in the song?
Frank Ocean and Migos are on the track.
Ok I think I have heard it.
It is a great song, it gives me especially great feelings, it is uplifting for going out at night too.
Ok I like that, thank you for mentioning.
