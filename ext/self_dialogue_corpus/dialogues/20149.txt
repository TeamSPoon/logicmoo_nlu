Worst movie ever...go
what genere? Independant? Production? Horror or drama?
I meant just overall.
mermaids, I hated Cher in that movie.
really? I thought Cher was great in it.
Winona Ryder acted like a spoiled brat.
Wasn't that the idea?
Maybe, but I thought Christina Ricci was very believable.
What makes you hate it so much?
The storyline really, in that day, a mom like that would have been seen as a woman of loose morals and to get involved would have cost that guy business.
He would have went broke just for who he was dating?
yes, people didn't play back then.
Is that why they had to move all the time?
That is what they story led us to believe
I thought Cher gave a very believable performance when Ricci had almost drown and she slapped Ryder.
That was a good scene, I wanted to applaud, she needed smacked, acting a fool like that.
Who was the guy that played her boyfriend?
I can't remember, but I think Rob Lowe would have done well in that roll.
What else did you not like about it?
The fact she fed them candy all the time, she would have known how to cook!
