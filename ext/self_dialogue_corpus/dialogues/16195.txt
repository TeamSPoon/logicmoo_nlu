What was your favorite part about high school music groups?
Probably the non-jazz functions of the jazz band.
How can a jazz band be used for reasons other than jazz?
We had two jazz bands, an A and a B band.
Let me guess, you were in the C band.
Ouch. Good one, but ouch.
Thanks!
The A band, which I was in thank you very much, was the one that toured and did competitions with jazz music.
So, the non-functional part?
We rotated with the other band and performed at the basketball games.
So the jazz band was a pep band?
Yup!
And you rallied the team with ... jazz?
Ha, no. Pop standards usually from the 80s or earlier, made for a large band.
What was the instrumentation?
4 trumpets, 4 trombones, 4 saxophones, guitar, drums, piano. But we doubled up each part sometimes.
Wow, that's a lot in an auditorium
Yeah, we were loud.
What did you play, Mr. Tuba?
I was a trumpeter in Jazz band. Tuba was for concert band.
