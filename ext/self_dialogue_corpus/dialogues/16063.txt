Did you know that Chris Thile married Adalind from Grimm?
Really? Who's Chris Thile?
Oh, he's the mandolinist for the Punch Brothers.
The Punch Brothers?  Never heard of them.
Oh! They're this awesome bluegrass group.  Well, kinda bluegrass, but also different and way cool.
What kind of different?  I never thought you'd be into bluegrass music.
I used to think that, then I heard this new wave of bluegrass that's fun, edgy, and even a little jazzy.
Tell me more about it.  I'm a little curious.
Well, there's this one group called Yonder Mountain String Band.  They're pretty progressive, and I heard them break into a metal version of one of their songs with a banjo!
That's wild!  I always thought bluegrass was full of old-timey folks and hillbillies.
You'd be surprised.  You should give some of these newer progressive groups a try.  I bet you'd like them!
Can you recommend anything to me?
Of course!  Yonder Mountain just came out with a new album this month called "Love. Ain't Love."  I heard it's good.
You haven't listened to it yet?
Eh, not yet, but I love their album "Black Sheep".  It came out a few years ago.
Huh.  Interesting.  I'd want to hear something before I bought it though.  I am still surprised you like this banjo stuff.
Dude, it's not just about the banjos.  Yes, there are banjos, but it's really cool.  You-tube it, you'll see.
Maybe I will!  Oh wow.  I see they blacked at the Red Rocks Amphitheater.  That's such an awesome venue!
No kidding.  And these cool bluegrass groups play there all the time!  I think String Cheese Incident is playing there in a month or two.
There's a band called String Cheese Incident?  Now you're just making stuff up.
