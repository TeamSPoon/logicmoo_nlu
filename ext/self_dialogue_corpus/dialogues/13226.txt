How many Star Wars movies do you think they will end up making?
As many as can be profitable.
That's kind of cynical, don't you think?
I'm just sick of seeing another movie franchise being sold to the highest bidder, and then being squeezed for every penny it's worth.
I don't think it's as bad as all that, because I can see some creativity in these new movies.
I guess they are still entertaining, and it will be nice to see what another director can do with the characters and world of Star Wars.
Yes, J.J. Abrams is a competent science-fiction guy, so I put my trust into him.
I agree, but I think that some of his stuff like Lost didn't finish well.
Well I'm on board for these movies just to see how Luke Skywalker figures into the new plot.
I'll admit, it was very cool seeing Mark Hamill play that role again.
