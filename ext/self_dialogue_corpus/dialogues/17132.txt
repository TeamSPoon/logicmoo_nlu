Who are the worst artists of all time?
I gotta give Limp Bizkit the nod.  Even beyond how juvenile their songs are, Fred Durst's whiny voice would ruin a brilliant song.
I don't really care for Bjork.  I used to know people who were really into her music, and I thought it was crap, and she was a nut.
What are some overrated bands, in your opinion?
Nirvana.  I like them, but people act like Kurt Cobain was such a genius because he died young.
Agreed-- Rolling Stone said he was the artist of the decade a while back, and I was thinking not even close.
Yeah, they had a few catchy songs.  It'd be like saying the guy from Dexy's Midnight Runners was artist of the decade for the 80s.
Come On Eileen is better than Nirvana's entire catalogue.
You can't trust Rolling Stone at all-- they have no credibility.
Yeah, I remember they called R. Kelly a genius for his awful Trapped in the Closet series.
When they lost all credibility with me was when they claimed Jack White was a better guitarist than Dave Gilmour.
Pink Floyd is a legendary band.  Jack White is a guy who people think may've married his sister.
Haha, yeah, but he was big at the time, so they had to toe that corporate line.
What're some other overrated bands, in your opinion?
Sublime.  Once again, I like a few songs of theirs, but not as good as everyone says.
I completely agree with that!  The lyrics to their songs sound like what a 12 year old would write.
I never saw the big deal about Madonna, either.  Once again, a few catchy songs, but I wouldn't pay 100s of dollars to see her in concert.
What's your guilty pleasure?  Something you listen to that you'd rather others not know about?
I don't really care what people think of my music tastes, but I'd say Tahiti 80-- this French pop band.
Haha, for me, it's George Michael.
