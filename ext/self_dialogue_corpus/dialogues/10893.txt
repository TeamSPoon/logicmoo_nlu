Have you seen Fate of the Furious yet?
No I haven't, how many have there been now?
That is the eighth one, came out not too long ago.
I have not seen any since Tokyo Drift?
You stopped right when it starts to get good.
Really?  It felt like it was getting so bad.
I think the fifth and the sixth were the best.
The third was really bad.
Yea, they became more entertaining and more action movies after that.
Maybe I will go back and watch some.
