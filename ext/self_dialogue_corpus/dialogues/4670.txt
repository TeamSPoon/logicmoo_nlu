Did you see the Dodgers game last night?
I heard there was drama
There was a ton of it
What was it based around?
The unwritten rules of baseball
Someone hit someone?
Cody Bellinger hit a homer
So they threw at the next batter?
Yea and then Stanton got thrown at
So did the pitcher get ejected?
The pitcher and the bench coach for the Dodgers
Anyone from the other team?
It was Miami and yes Mattingly did.
What was he pissed about
That the Dodgers had a lead and were swining at 3-0 pitches
See this is what gets me mad about baseball
I agree
You should be able to do what you want when you want
I concur with you again
Until they clean that up this crap is going to coninue
