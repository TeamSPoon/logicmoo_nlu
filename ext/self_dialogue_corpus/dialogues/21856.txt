What's your favorite movie of all time?
Probably the Godfather
That's a pretty good one
Yeah, has all the elements you need in a good movie. Story line
Characters, acting.
Twists and turns
Killing and double-crossing
Mafia undertones
Well, sometimes we shouldn't talk about the mafia
Ha, unless you're part of the family
I liked Al Pacino's role a lot in the first one
Yeah, he was so young in that movie
Yes, he seemed to transform as the series went along
Wasn't he a young Marine in the first one?
Yes, at one point, but then inherits the family business
Oh right, because the older son dies
Yes, shot up at the toll stop
Yeah, that's right
And then the other son was kind of a wimp
Fredo Corleone. Yes, he did some bad things
