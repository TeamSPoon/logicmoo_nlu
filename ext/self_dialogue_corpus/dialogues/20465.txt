I'm excited to see the third Planet of the Apes movie coming out soon.
My wife won't watch those movies with me - she is afraid of jumping monkeys.
That's an oddly specific fear. I think those movies are surprisingly well done.
I guess we know that the apes will win the war, so that won't be too big of a surprise.
That's true. I wonder if we will find out how humans lose the ability to speak as they do in the original Charlton Heston movie.
I've heard a lot of bad things about the new Transformers movie that just came out.
I can't believe it is the fifth movie in that series. Hopefully it will be the last.
It's too bad Shia Labeouf isn't in the movies anymore. He's a pretty underrated actor.
Now they are starring Mark Whalberg. He does a good job at playing sort of an every man.
Did you hear the news about Disney firing the directors of the young Han Solo movie?
Oh wow, I didn't hear that - what happened?
They were pretty far into filming but then the two directors got fired. Apparently it was due to creative differences.
Who were the directors?
It was Chris Miller and Phil Lord. They had previously done The Lego Movie and 21 Jump Street.
I wonder what the creative differences were?
The rumor I heard was that they were changing too much of Lawrence Kasdan's script and doing too much improvisation on set.
Who are they going to have be the new director?
They got Ron Howard to come in. Should be interesting to see how the final movie turns out.
I guess with so much riding on the Star Wars franchise there isn't a lot of room for experimentation.
The same thing happened on Rogue One where they brought in Tony Gilroy for reshoots.
