Hey, what is that you are doing on the computer?
Just looking for some songs to listen to.
Oh cool! What kind of songs are you interested in?
Well right now I am looking for some older country songs. A friend of mine let me listen to some Johnny Cash songs and I fell in love with them.
Was he the one who always wore black?
Yeah that's him. He has some awesome songs so I thought I might like some more songs of that era.
What is your favorite Johnny Cash song?
There are so many of them! I would have to say that my favorites are Ring of Fire, Folsom Prison Blues, and of course Hurt.
Those are all really good ones. Have you listened to the ones that he did with his wife June Carter?
No I haven't heard any of them yet. What are some of the names?
There is Jackson, Cause I Love You, Old Time Feeling, and of course my favorite is Time's A Wastin.
I will have to give all of those a try them. I love Johnny Cash now and I love the songs that I have heard from June Carter.
Yeah, the two of them make an awesome duo.
What are some of her biggest hits?
Wildwood Flower, The Loving Gift, and I Used To Be Somebody.
I don't think I have ever heard of those.
They are really good. You should give them a listen.
I wish they were both still around making music.
Yeah I would definitely like to go to one of their concerts.
Me to, especially one that they did together.
