So, I've been listening The Beatles a lot lately....
Oh, yeah? I love them. Which albums?
Sgt. Pepper's -- very trippy album!
Haha, yes! The songs are really great though.
What do you think Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds is about?
Well, I've read some people think it's about drugs but John Lennon said it was about a drawing his son made.
Oh, wow that's interesting. I didn't know that!
Yeah, John's son drew a picture of a woman flying and said her name was Lucy in the sky with diamonds.
That's cool he got his songwriting inspiration from his son!
Yeah, that's a good song! I also love A Day in the Life from that album.
