How do you think the New York Giants will do this year?
D=Not sure...depends on Eli
You think he'll turn it around?
He could...don't know if he wants to
Well they were 11-5 last year.
But he only threw for 26 tds last year.
But they made the playoffs last year
...and got embarrassed too
Odell and Victor have to play well
Yup. Not even sure who their running back is
I think it's Jennings
Whatever...just hope they can beat Dallas
Didn't they beat them last year?
Yup. Both times too...
I think that's their first game this year
It's an away game too
Well the runninggame has to be there
I just think they have enough
They'll beat Dallas like a drum
Maybe, maybe not
