Which sports do you like?
Hockey and really not many others.
I like hockey too. I have tickets to a game in Toronto if you want to go.
I'd love that. How fun!
It's next Sunday so I'll pick you up and we can ride together.
OK. If I get confused on the game you might need to inform me.
I will. I used to play so it's not hard for me to follow.
I sometimes lose track of who has the puck.
Everyone does that. It can be hard to keep track.
It does get chaotic sometimes.
True but it's so much fun.
When I went to a game once the puck hit a guy in the face. I was glad they had those guards.
Yes, without those players can get hurt badly.
Did you ever get hurt while playing?
I sprained my wrist once but that's it.
Ouch!
It did hurt. It healed well, though.
That's good.
The game we're going to is a big deciding game.
Awesome. I can't wait.
