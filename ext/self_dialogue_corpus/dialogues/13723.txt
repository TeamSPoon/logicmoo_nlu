Wasn't she wearing her meat outfit in video for Poker Face?
I don't think so.
So when did she wear that?
It was at some awards show, probably the Emmy awards.
Oh.  Poker Face would have been an appropriate song to wear it.
I'm afraid to ask, but why do you think that?
Well, in poker, you need to act confident and defiant.
I'm not following.
If you were wearing meat, everybody would know you're not afraid to bluff, right?
That's some twisted logic if you ask me.
