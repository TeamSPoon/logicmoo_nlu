When did the NFL begin?
You could argue 1920.
Argue? Why do you have to argue?
Well, they started in 1920. But, the league was called the American Professional Football Conference -- the APFC.
I see. When did they become the NFL?
That change happened in 1922.
Are any of those teams still around?
Yes, there are two of the founding teams still in existence.
Which two?
Only the Chicago Bears and the Arizona Cardinals remain.
They had a team in Arizona in 1922?
No, actually, both those teams started in Chicago.
What were their names in 1922?
The Chicago Bears were called the Decatur Staleys.
And, the Cardinals?
They were called the Chicago Cardinals.
That makes sense.
Yes, it is interesting how teams change over the years.
Give me an example.
The Browns started in 1945. But, they were originally in All-America Football Conference -- the AAFC.
