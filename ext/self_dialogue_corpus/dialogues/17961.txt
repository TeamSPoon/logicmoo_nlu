What do you think of Lil Wayne?
I don't know who that is.
He's the rap artist that wrote the song Lollipop.
I don't like rap.
Why not?
Because I think too much of the content is extremely negative.
How so?
It always seems like they're being misogynistic, using drugs, or doing some kind of crime or violence.
Some songs are like that I guess.
And I just don't think that's the message we should be sending our youth.
Still, it's a bit stereotypical to say that all rap is that way.
Maybe, but it's a huge turn off nonetheless.
Is there any rap that you do like?
I've listened to Too Short in the past, but certainly not for the lyrics.
Why did you like Too Short?
Mostly because the music sounded very good with a quality stereo.
You mean that you like his bass lines?
Pretty much.  The bass and the beat in general seem like they were designed for large subwoofers.
That's one of my favorite things about rap.
I guess it's my only favorite.  I just like good, loud beats.
