Have you seen Alien: Covenant yet?
Not yet. Have you?
Yeah, I saw it yesterday.
How was it? No spoilers, please.
It was okay, I guess.
Was it as good as the original trilogy?
I can't answer that without divulging into spoilers.
Well, how many stars would you give it then?
Six.
Really? Six?
That's my personal rating. You might like it.
So you didn't like it?
Not really.
Why not?
Have you seen Prometheus?
Yes.
Covenant is closer to that movie than the original Alien movies.
Really? I'm going to go see it in a few hours. I'll see for myself.
Cool. Keep your expectations low and you won't be disappointed.
I'll keep that in mind.
