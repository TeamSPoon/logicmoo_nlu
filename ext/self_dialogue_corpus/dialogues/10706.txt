Did you see the new Fast and Furious movie?
Fast 8, yeah it was good.
What was your favorite part?
I thought the part with him fighting people while having the baby wear headphones was funny.
Yeah that was funny, but why did he put the headphones on full blast?
I don't know.
Have you ever accidentally had the volume real loud on some headphones? It's aweful. Can't be good for a baby.
No you're right. What about the camera in the necklace? How did Dom know how to do all that?
I don't know, he's Dom. He can do anything. He grew up just a street racer, but now can take down international terrorists.
True. I guess your right. Just don't think too hard about it.
