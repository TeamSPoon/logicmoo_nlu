I want to go to a Vikings game this season.
Did you win the lottery?
No, but I really want to go.
You practically have to take out a third or fourth mortgage to afford a ticket to a pro game these days.
Tell me about it. And even then they're hard to find.
Way back in the day my Aunt had season tickets.
Wow, you have to be on a waiting list to get those now.
I know, and they are a billion times more expensive now that they were then.
Did she go to a lot of games?
She did until her health started failing.
That's when she sold them?
No, she hung on to them for years and years past the point that she could attend games.
Why?
Because of the waiting list, She didn't want to let them go.
Did you ever go to one?
Once, and never again.
Why?
Aside from the fact that I dislike sports this was an outside winter game back when the Met Stadium was where the Mall of America stands now.
You didn't like it?
I felt like a prize fool sitting outside freezing and paying for the privilege.
