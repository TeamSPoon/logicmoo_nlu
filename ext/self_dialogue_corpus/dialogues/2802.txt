When does the NFL pre-season start this year?
Sometime in the first week of August.
What team are you rooting for this year
The Dolphins, like always.
Good luck with that.
I know right. What team are you rooting for?
I like Tampa Bucs and want to see them go to the superbowl.
I think they have a pretty good chance.
The team has potential, but it's not the same since all the good players are gone.
Like who? Just name one.
Ok. Definitely, Warren Sapp.
Yes. He was an awesome player.
I heard all those concussions had an impact on his brain.
I heard something about that too, and I believe he is donating his brain to research because of his memory issues.
That's right. He will be a team player that is always remembered.
Yes, I know you know he made it into the Hall of Fame back in 2013.
How not? This great defensive tackle from 1995-2007 gave the world great, game performance to be remembered.
He also did a lot for others off the field too.
Well, I hope your Dolphins make you happy this year.
Same to you, about your Bucs.
