What is your top genre when trying to relax?
For me it is classical music.
I can see how that may work, I find it too stimulating.
I think it depends what song or composer you choose to listen to.
I prefer songs from enya when trying to relax.
Enya have not thought of her in years.
Probably true of most people.
She had some good songs back in the day.
I think they are still good.
if you are looking for relaxing music have you looked into the Solfeggio music?
Never heard of it.
I think you would like it. It is frequency to balance your energy and said to keep your body, mind and spirit in harmony.
That sounds incredible!
Uses an  ancient 6-tone scale .
I will have to find some.
They were used a lot in gregorian chants so that may be a good start.
Thanks for this introduction.
No problem, I am glad to spread the word.
Any preferred classical composers as well?
I say for relaxing vivaldi. Or moonlight sonata is a good song for that.
