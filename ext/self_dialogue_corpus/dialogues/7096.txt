I remember the first Toy Story movie; I think we watched it ten times.
Me, too!  My favorite character is Mr. Potato Head, he's so funny.
Poor Woody starts out as the toy in charge, the most important.
Yeah, until Buzz Lightyear comes along.
I used to pretend that my toys would do things, in a way, like they were real, but I never imagined what these toys did.
I kind of look at toys in a different light now, like, is this toy going to come to life as soon as I shut the door and leave?
I know what you mean.  It used to give me nightmares, wondering if a spider with a baby head was going to come crawling up my leg!
Ewww!  That gives me the creeps!
The whole perseverance thing with Woody and Buzz, though, is what I remember best from it.
I like it that they were friends at the end.
