How many Alladin movies are there all together?
I'm not sure. I only saw the first one.
Don't remember if there are two or three.
Don't know, but the first one was a great movie.
It was. I liked Alladin.
Robin Williams was a great Genie.
I forgot that was him.
He was good.
Gilbert Gottfried was in that too.
Yes, he was the bird.
