Okay. My favorite movie of all time would have to be Inglorious Basterds.
I don't know about "all time" favorite, but it's certainly an amazing movie.
Well, I just think it's so good because because of the guy who played Hans Landa.
Oh, yeah. That was Christoph Waltz. Isn't he fantastic?
He absolutely made that movie for me.
Well, it was good on it's own.
Yeah, but he is positively evil! And his voice is so chilling.
I love the way he says the most rotten stuff with this horribly happy sounding tone.
See? That's what makes him so good.
You're right. Did you see him in Django Unchained?
Of course I did!
Well, what did you think?
Obviously, I loved him. Everything he does it perfect.
You really like this guy!
I don't know how he was undiscovered for so long, but Quentin Tarantino made him a star.
Hard to argue with that. He deserves it, too. He really is one of the greats.
Did you know he doesn't even speak fluent Italian, but he still spoke it in Inglorious Basterds?
He must have practiced so much. What a talented guy.
So, you see why I love him so much?
Okay, okay! I guess I understand.
