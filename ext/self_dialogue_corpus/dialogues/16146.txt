How do you feel about Fleetwood Mac?
They're OK. Some good songs: Sara, especially.
That's their best.
I think it's interesting how they went from cool to adult contemporary cheesy and back to cool.
Very rare for a band to have an arc like that.
After Rumors it was downhill.
True.
The whole Stevie Nicks - Lindsay Buckingham romance story is wild too.
Yes, i used to think that was just the 1970s partner-swapping thing.
There was more to it.
Yes, it's really a tragic romance undone by one weak moment.
It was many years before I realized that.
Exactly. But the whole band was having affairs with each other, which obscured it.
That was my sense too.
Stevie Nicks had good solo stuff also.
Yes, she was on American Horror Story a few seasons ago too.
That was OK, I saw that.
She was funny to have as a cameo but didn't do much.
She can pretty much choose whaever gig she wants now.
She's a legend.
