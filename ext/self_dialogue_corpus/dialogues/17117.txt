Have you heard the group Chainsmokers?
Yes, they are sooo bad.
I agree, I can't believe how much radio play they get.
They really seem to have little to no talent.
I know right, it;s like the most basic beat and then lay some crappy lyrics over it
Yup, that seems to be the pattern.
I was surprised when I saw them on Saturday Night Live.
I know right? Usually they have decent bands but they were a let down.
Do you know where they are from?
Oh they are US based, it is only 2 guys.
What was their first hit called again?
It was #Selfie
What a terrible name for a song, why doesn't that surprise me.
I know, so indicative of the quality of the music right.
What happened to good music like The Gorrilaz?
Oh they are still around.
Really, do they have anything new out?
I think so, I saw a new video on Youtube.
How was it.
Classic Gorrilaz stuff, great beat, great video, you should check it out!
