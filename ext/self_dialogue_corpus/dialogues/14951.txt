Have you seen fist fight?
The new version or the original?
Huh? There was an original? I didn't know that.
Yeah it's older,  but no... I haven't seen the remake.
It's pretty funny, it has ice cube and Charlie day.
Oh Charlie day is great,  I liked him in Pacific rim.
That's not a comedy is it?
No but he still does a good job,  and his character is pretty funny.
That's good.  I liked Charlie day in horrible bosses.
Oh yeah haha now THATS a comedy movie!
