What kind of music have you been listening to lately?
Lately I have been on a Frank Sinatra kick.
Just Frank Sinatra?
No, not JUST Frank Sinatra!
Well who else then?
Other people who are similar or from the same time period.
What about Michael Buble?
I do really enjoy quite a bit of his music.
It is amazing how he sounds just like he belongs in that time period.
He does, I love his remakes of the classics.
Have you heard any of his original songs?
Yes I have, but if I didn't know almost all of the songs from the Sinatra time period I wouldn't pick them out as new.
I know, it is amazing how he can keep that feel and style in his original songs.
What is your favorite of his originals?
I really enjoy "Close Your Eyes".
That is a really good one. Why is that your favorite?
My husband said it reminds him of me, and I just think that it is such a beautiful song.
I like that one, but I love "Everything" as well.
I like that one too. My favorite remake he does is "Unforgettable".
I love his voice on that song as well.
