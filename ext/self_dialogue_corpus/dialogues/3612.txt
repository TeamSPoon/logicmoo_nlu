Have you seen the horror movie Uzumaki?
What is that? Is it really scary?
Uzumaki is by a Japanese manga artist I believe. His stories are truly horrifying... I mean campy.
Campy like Scary Movie or campy like, you're lying to me!
Campy like... well you'll have to see it. This isn't like Scary Movie but it isn't that horrifying.
I feel like you're lying to me since you made me watch Human Centipede!
Okay, it is kind of more like Human Centipede where it's bad campy but your brain might fill in the gaps.
Ew! I still hate you for that!
But it's not entirely like Human Centipede and less disgusting.
I don't believe you and I'm not watching anymore horror movies with you!
