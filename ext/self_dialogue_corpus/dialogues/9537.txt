The 90's had some pretty decent mainstream rap...
Yeah, I LOVED Blacksheep.  Remember their album A Wolf in Sheep's Clothing?
Oh yeah!  That one had U Mean I'm Not and This or That, right?
Ha ha ha!!  Yes!  U Mean I'm Not was hilarious - parody, satire, I guess it could be classified...
How about someone like Eminem, though?
I mean, he was mainstream, kind of...but maybe got too hot to handle later on...
His thing turned into like a soap opera...
Yeah, like it wasn't so much about his artwork, but his personal life supposedly got dragged into everything.  Whole tracks were dedicated to family members, etc.
Yeah, but he sure as all get-out was fascinating to watch and listen to.  Just couldn't help myself.
Neither could I...  Need to see what Eminem's up to now...
