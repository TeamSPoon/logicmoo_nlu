I have a paper to write about the best movies of all time
That should be fun
Yes, care to help me decide?
How many movies do you need?
I need ten, but would appreciate you helping me with the top 5
Oh sure, lets see, for me, number 1 would be The Godfather
Oh for sure, I bet most would agree, I love Dirty dancing
Women all over the world are agreeing
I think the wizard of OZ has to come before Dirty dancing
Yes, I think your right
What about the shining
Oh man, Jack Nicholson is so creepy in that, good one
what about pulp fiction or Gladiator
I love gladiator, I watched it 5 times, I never got pulp fiction
jaws? I watched that at 5 years old, and still wont go above my knees at the beach
That has to be on the list
Rocky? How do we even narrow down the top 5, there are so many
Its silly to even have to say this, but Star wars
I think that has to be number 1
I agree
