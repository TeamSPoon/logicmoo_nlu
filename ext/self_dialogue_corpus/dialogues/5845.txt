What is you favorite Disney movie?
I love so many, it would be hard to choose. I think my favorite would be The Little Mermaid.
Great choice. I like that one too.
There are great characters and songs!
Ariel is a beautiful princess. That hair!
I think Sebastian is hilarious.
The part where her dad gives up power just so she can have her voice back always gets me.
Disney movies always have an emotional scene!
I know it is not realistic but I have always found Mermaids to be very magical.
I think its that its under water and it is more of a mystery to us.
