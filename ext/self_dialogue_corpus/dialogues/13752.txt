what did you think of perfect illusion?
to be honest, i did not like it.
i liked it.
i was scared the whole album would be like that.
it was a big strong song though.
it reminded me too much of artpop.
artpop was grand but wasn't catchy enough.
that was what i got from perfect illusion
i get what you mean.
the chorus was not as strong either
