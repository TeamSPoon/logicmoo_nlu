So what did you think about star wars rogue?
Yes, I think its one of my favorite star wars movies.
Really i thought it was pretty good too but i don't know about one of my favorites, i liked the orginal trilogy a lot more.
Yea but it was certainly better than the george lucas prequels.
Thats for sure jake loyld and hayden christian were terrbile.
Lol, thats for sure.  Are you excited for the han solo and boba fett movies that are coming out soon.
You bet i am i cant wait, im as excited for them as i am to see the last jedi.
Ya me too,  Ive already started thinking about wether im going to camp out opening night.
Thats a little much for me, its too cold to be waiting in line and im too old for that.
True but i always think its worth it, that way no one can accidently ruin the movie for you.
Thats always true i had someone do that for zombieland right before i went to go see it.
Aww man that is a bummer, did i tell you i started my rogue one collection?
No you didn't what are you collecting.
O my favorite characters action figures in the black series, i also got 2 rogue one movie posters from the theaters, and some of the POP booble heads.
Ahh too cool, who are your favorite characters from rogue one.
O i really like jyn erso, bodhi, blaze, and the new robto ks20.
KS 20 was also one of my favorites, his lines in the movie were so funny.
I know i especially loved the line "ill be there for you jyn, cassain said i had too"  i lost it when i heard that the first time watching the movie.
Lol me too, i think i might even like him more than R2-D2.
I don't know about that but he is up there in the top 5 best driods in the star wars universe.
