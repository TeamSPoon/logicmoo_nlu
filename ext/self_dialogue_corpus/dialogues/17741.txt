So music has indeed a lot of power over our thoughts and feelings
Check this out; I found an interesting reference you might like in that regard
Where did you find it?
It's quoted by writer John Stainer: "No art is as influential on mankind nowadays as music is".
Sounds powerful. Did you find it on a video interview or where?
I found it in this book "The Music of the Bible"
I'm glad you're getting to like the subject
So well, are biblical references to music limited only to the Old Testament?
You will be surprised the Greek scriptures carry their share too!
I hope they will be as impressive as the ones we have already reviewed
Let's check out the Gospel of Matthew chapter 6 verse 2
"When you give a gift to a beggar, don't shout about it as the hypocrites do -- blowing trumpets in the synagogues and streets to call attention to their acts of charity!"
How do you like that one?
It reminded me of the four thousand musicians in the temple we read about before. Blowing trumpets!
Next one is kind of cozier and, if you like, funnier. Luke chapter 7 verse 31
"They are like unto children that sit in the marketplace, and call one to another; who say, We piped unto you, and ye did not dance; we wailed, and ye did not weep."
So pipes come into scene; not as strident as trumpets, but just as telling.
Stop the instrumentals; what about a reference to singing?
You might like Matthew chapter 26 verse 30
"And when they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives"
