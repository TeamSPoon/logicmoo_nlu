What kind of music do you like to listen to?
I like so many different types. I guess it depends on my mood at the time.
I am the same way. When I want to get in a good mood I listen to pop.
Oh yeah, who is your favorite pop artist?
The king of pop of course, Michael Jackson.
He does have a lot of songs that make you want to get up and dance.
I know in 1982 he came out with some of the greatest songs ever.
Like Beat It and Thriller. The videos were amazing.
His dancing was amazing I could watch them all day.
The moon walk was the best move ever. I practice it for months but never really mastered it.
