I was telling my daughter to watch some of the rat pack movies.
What are rat pack movies?
You know, with the teen actors of the eightees.
You mean Molly Ringwald and all of the other ones?
Yes. I told her to start with Breakfast Club, Sixteen Candles and even Valley Girls.
Who is in Valley Girls?
That wasn't the rat pack That was actually Nicolas Cage.
Okay , I remember that vaguely.
Yea, he looked so weird in that movie.
What's funny is ,that is how things were back then.
Yes, Nick Cage in his glory days.
He has had so many good movies.
Funny how people still have their separate groups.
Unfortunately it still is. Now I think it's worse.
Like in Breakfast club, there was a jock, a preppy an emo person.
They are still like that in school now.
Yes, but I think they have worse names for each other now.
Wish we could go back to those rat pack days.
A lot of those actors went on to have great movie careers.
My favorite was Ally Sheedy.
