You know what I just saw was awesome?  Braveheart.
Yes!  Great movie, how have you not seen it till now.
Everyone has that one movie they never saw.  But it was great.
The fight scenes were aweseome.
Good plot line too.
I think it's Mel Gibson's best work.
Yeah, by a wide margin too.  Although he does a lot of good stuff.
Yeah, except he went kind of bonkers.
Meh, everyone is a little weird.
He, remember the part where he hid the spears and destroyed the Calvary?
That was awesome.  How about that crazy Irish guy.
Yeah, he was one of my favorite characters.
Yeah, good comedic relief.
That king was a total jerk.
Yes he was.  Also terrible how he killed his sons lover.
Well that's the way things were back then.
Yeah, still doesn't make it right.
Yeah, how about the ending with Robert the Bruce.
I loved that part.
You've bled with Wallace, now bleed with me.
