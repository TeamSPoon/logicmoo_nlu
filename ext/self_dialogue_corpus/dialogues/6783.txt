What is your favorite Disney movie?
My favorite is Snow White
Why is that your favorite?
I like the dwarves. They are really funny.
Did you see it in the theater?
No, I that was before my time.
Do you like any other Disney movies?
I also like Toy Story and Lion King.
I liked Lion King. But I felt like Simba should have stuck with his pride.
Yeah, he wasted his whole teenage life.
