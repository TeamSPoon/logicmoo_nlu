Do you know if Kirk Cousins and the Redskins ever struck a deal?
No, they never found a middle ground.
That's too bad. I thought they were supposed to be close?
First he was far away from a deal, then they were close, now they're far away again.
What is he asking for?
The rumors were north of $20 million per year.
Well, it's not even clear if he really wants to return.
Yeah, I didn't think he'd even consider an offer.
Where does he want to go?
Reportedly the 49ers, where his old offensive coordinator is now the coach.
Do you think the Redskins will just slap the franchise tag again on next year?
I doubt it. That carries a salary over $30 million, guaranteed.
And the Redskins need help in other areas, for sure.
I don't want they're expecting to happen at wide receiver.
I think they're counting on Jamison Crowder to make a leap, and Terrelle Pryor should be solid.
I guess, but he's still getting used to the position.
Jordan Reed's a nice safety valve, anyway.
Don't you still worry about his health, though?
Of course, but I think Vernon Davis can still be a decent stopgap.
Until he hits his wall, and at his age, you know it's coming.
