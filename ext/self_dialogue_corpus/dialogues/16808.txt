Do you like any Hip Hop or R&B music?
I like some! One of my favorite artists from back in the day was Boyz 2 Men.
Yes they were great! I still listen to their music.
I have some of their music on my computer to listen to at home.
What other Hip Hop music do you like?
I also really loved artists like Blackstreet, Brandy, Snoop Dogg, etc.
Those are greats too. Did you like Tupac?
Yes I had forgotten about him! But of course!
I liked the song he made dedicated to his mom.
Yes that was a beautiful song.
Do you remember that movie Soul Food from way back when?
I think so, it sounds familiar.
One of the Boys 2 Men songs that I love is on that movie. It was such a sad song but so beautiful. I can't remember the name now though.
I'll have to watch that movie again soon.
Do you remember that one song "California Love" with Tupac?
Oh definitely! I actually have that song on my phone.
I still really like it, probably because I am from California too so it speaks to me.
I really enjoy 90's music the best, there were some greats.
Yes me too. It's still mostly what I listen to these days.
Me too. They don't make music like they used to.
