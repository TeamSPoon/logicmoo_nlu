I cannot wait for them to make the live action version of Aladdin. It is my favorite Disney movie.
I am a little scared because of director.  He isn't really known for kids movies.
I can't wait to see who they cast in the movie, they are kind of tricky roles to fill.
I heard that Will Smith might be the genie.  I'm not sure how I feel about that yet.
Robin Williams will be hard to replace, his performance was iconic.
I head that they weren't even sure about keeping the songs in it yet.
What?! They have to keep the songs in it, it wouldnt be the same.
And I wonder how they will do Iago, he was pretty important.
Oh yeah, I forgot about Abu!  They will probably have to use some CGI.
It wasn't too bad in Beauty and the Beast, maybe they will do a nice job in Aladdin.
