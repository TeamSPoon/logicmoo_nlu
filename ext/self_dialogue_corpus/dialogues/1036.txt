Who do you think the best quarterback in the NFL is?
Ben Roethlisberger!
Yes, he is good. But, it's because of the weapons.
Weapons?
Yes, the receivers he has in the backfield.
You mean Antonio Brown?
Yes, he is amazing.
True, but that's not why Ben is so great.
Why is he great, then?
He is dedicated, brave, and bold!
I see. And, those qualities are what it takes to be in the NFL?
Yes, you have to be tough too.
That's true. There are a lot of injuries.
Yes, Ben has had several of them.
Concussions?
Yes, I think so.
Those are scary!
True, but they have excellent medical teams in the NFL.
That's true. I'm glad the players are safe.
Yes, I like to see them on the field and not in the hospital!
