Hey, did you hear about Chris Cornell?
The lead singer of Soundgarden? No, why?
He passed away.
I really hate to hear that, I really enjoyed his music.
So did I, those sounds were part of my childhood.
It seems we lose so many great artists, Kurt Cobain being another example.
Yeah, I loved Nirvana when I was younger, their music really put the industry on it's ear.
It was so different and just really spoke to me at that age.
It's not like the junk  people are putting out these days.
Yeah, if I hear another Taylor Swift song I may lose my mind.
I still love the song Black Hole Sun by Soundgarden.
That was one of my favorites as well.
And of course Smells Like Team Spirit from Nirvana.
I pretty much listened to that entire album, so many good songs.
What other bands did you like during that era?
Pearl Jam was another favorite of mine.
Ah, yeah. They had some great songs, and came from the same area as Nirvana.
I got to listening to Foo Fighters a lot. I really like Dave Grohl.
Yeah, he was the drummer for Nirvana till he started his own band.
I really enjoy his music, and how it makes me think about Kurt Cobain when I hear it. Such a tragic story.
