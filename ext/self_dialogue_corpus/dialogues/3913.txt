Did you see The Hitcher?
I only saw the old one.
That's the best one. Rutger Hauer is great!
Yes! I love when he wets the pennies and sticks them on the kid's eyes!
And when he tells the kid to say "I wanna die." He was perfect for that role.
Yes he was. Did you see Hemoglobin?
No, I never heard of it.
You have to see it! Great movie and Rutger is in it!
How old is it?
It's from the mid or late 90s.
