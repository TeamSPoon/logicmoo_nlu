What did you think about last year's Super Bowl?
Amazing game, one of the most exciting second halves I've seen in a Super Bowl!
Amazing unless you are a Falcons fan, then it was a nightmare.
That's true. I'm not a fan of either team though so I just enjoy a good,competitive game.
Who do you think will get to the Super Bowl this year?
It's way too early to make a prediction like that. People who try before the season even starts are always wrong.
Okay who do you want to get to the Super Bowl rather than who you think actually will?
I'm hoping the Green Bay Packers will get there.
Aaron Rodgers is obviously going to be good but how is their defense going to be?
That's the big question, I think it's adequate. There's some question about how well they can stop the good team in the league.
Who is your favorite Packers defensive player?
I think linebacker, Clay Matthews is really good. I like watching him play.
Most people would say Julius Peppers as their favorite Packers defensive player.
He's great too, I just really like watching Clay Matthews. I respect his skills at the position he plays.
Are you going to go to any Packers games this year?
I'd love to go to a game at Lambeau Field, it's an amazing game day atmosphere but I probably won't be able to afford a ticket this year.
How many games have you been to in Green Bay?
In my lifetime I've probably been to about 10 games.
I always try to get to at least one game per year for my team.
Watching an NFL game in person is so much better than watching it on television.
