Have you heard the most recent Ed Sheeran song?
I think so, but unfortunately his songs all blend together for me.
Oh, really? He's my favorite artist.
I prefer Coldplay.
Have you seen them in concert?
No, their concerts are way too expensive.
I know. It's hard to justify spending so much money.
Have you seen Ed Sheeran in concert?
Yes, but it was a really long time ago.
How was it? Is he good live?
He's amazing live! He did an acoustic set.
That's awesome. Some people sound terrible live.
You had a bad experience at a concert?
Yes. We saw Katy Perry live and she was so off-key.
That's so surprising.
She could barely hit any of the notes in "Firework" or "Dark Horse."
You would think that a famous act like Katy Perry would be great live.
I guess not. We learned our lesson.
They should have refunded all your tickets.
I wish. I could have put that money toward a Coldplay concert.
