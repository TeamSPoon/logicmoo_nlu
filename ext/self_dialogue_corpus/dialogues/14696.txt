What do you think about college basketball vs. the NBA?
I strongly prefer watching college basketball.
Why? The NCAA takes advantage of its students by not paying them.
Well, they're not employees, and if they get scholarships, they have free tuition, so they are paid.
I still think they should be paid.
I just hate that they can't get ANYTHING from anyone. If you receive $5 for an autograph once in four years, you're kicked out, and a lot of these players are super poor.
Why else do you like them?
I think NCAA plays with more passion. They're there to make it to the next level and they know they have four years max to win a championship, so they have to go all-out.
Yeah, that's true, the NBA players are lazy as heck.
And the referees don't call traveling!
What do you think about men vs. women basketball?
The men would win because they're taller, faster, stronger...
That's not what I meant, you misogynist. Which do you prefer, and why?
I prefer men's. The women are too predictable--you always know who'll be in the final four and UConn will win the title.
Yeah, at least the men have ten teams each year that can win it all.
I also think it's more entertaining.
Ok, misogynist, how so?
Stop calling me that. I just like dunks, and with a handful of exceptions, women can't dunk. And if they can, it's barely above the rim.
Yeah, the men put on a show.
And that's what I'm paying to see. I'm not paying to see some excellent bounce passes.
