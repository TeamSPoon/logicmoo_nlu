Which do you like better - the original Star Wars or the "enhanced" version?
I'm kind of a purist when it comes to movies. The original version will always be my favorite.
Why? The special effects aren't as good, Han fired first...
I think it's because I saw the original Star Wars about 50 times in theaters.
Wow, you are a true fan.
It was my dad's favorite film, so we would all pile in the car every few weekends and go see it.
Okay, I can see why the original would be a sort of "memory movie" for you.
I see the enhanced version, and all the sweat and blood that went into on-set effects is gone, replaced by CGI.
I always thought most people would like the improved version.
Me, I don't necessarily regard the changes as "improvements." Not bad, just different from what I remember.
