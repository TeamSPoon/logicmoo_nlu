Did you see the game between the Astros and the Yankees?
Yea I can't believe Lance McCullers Jr. play!
He fired seven strikeouts in six shutout innings.
That was crazy! I can't believe that happened.
And at the plate, Brian McCann was great.
He unleashed a three-run bomb in the fourth inning!
Yea, this really secured the Astros' four-run lead.
I know. I'm look forward to 25 wins that they have on the season.
Me too, I can't believe it their fifth consecutive win of the week.
They're definitely on a roll.
What about the game between the Blue Jays and Mariners?
Joe Biagini did a great job that day as a starting pitcher.
I agree, a five spotless innings!
It really helped them secure their win 4-0 against the Mariners.
What about the game between the Braves and the Marlins?
I did see that game, the Marlins are off to a rocky start this year.
It's their fourth consecutive loss on Friday.
They came up empty-handed against Atlanta starter Mike Foltynewicz in the first three innings.
Yea but they had no match for Tyler Flowers.
Right, he had a second-inning blast and two RBI single in the seventh, taking home Braves' 12th win this year.
