Who's your favorite Disney movie princess?
I like Cinderella the best.
What about her do you like?
Well, that's the very first princess movie that I saw.
So she's like a classic princess for you?
I like how she fought against the evil stepsisters.
Yeah, it was easy to not like them at all.
They were so spoiled rotten and mean to Cinderella.
Did you want to dress up like her when you were a kid?
Yeah, I even got shoes that looked like her glass slippers.
