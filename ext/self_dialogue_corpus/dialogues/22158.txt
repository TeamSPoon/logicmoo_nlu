Have you seen the movie Arrival?
No, I haven't seen it. Who's in it?
Amy Adams was the main star. Forrest Whitaker also had a good role.
Wasn't that based on an award winning science fiction story?
Yes, it was based on "Story of Your Life" by Ted Chiang
Who directed it?
Denis Villeneuve
The French Canadian guy? Cool. I liked some of his stuff. What was Arrival about? I heard it was very smart.
It is quite brilliant. The premise is that aliens visit Earth, and learning their language changes our perception of time. But on a deeper level it is about something else entirely.
What would you say the deeper level is?
It was about being a parent whose child dies young, and asks: if you knew all the pain you would go through, would you still do it? Would it be worth it?
That's a profound question. But the language stuff, how did that fit in?
It was based on an extreme interpretation of the Sapir-Worf Hypothesis: the language you speak changes how you experience reality. The alien language caused one to perceive time all at once, so you would know what was going to happen.
That sounds crazy. I heard Arrival compared to Contact with Jodie Foster. Would you agree?
I have seen Contact and also loved it. There were definite parallels, but this goes in a very different direction.
Did you know that Jodie Foster's character was closely based on Carl Sagan?
Yes, I remember reading his wife said it was like watching him. The curiosity and pro-science aspect of that character was so wonderful to see.
I'm glad there are some more intelligent science fiction movies coming out, even if they are few and far between.
I agree, those are the ones I go for, and those are two of the best. I appreciate aliens that are intelligent and caring, and don't just want to kill and smash things!
Sure, although that can be fun too--take the Alien movies for example!
