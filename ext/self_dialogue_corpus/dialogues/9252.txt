I heard a Rush song on the radio today.
Yeah, which one?
Tom Sawyer.
I like their old stuff like that. Their new stuff not so much.
After like Grace Under Pressure I wasn't into them any more.
Exit Stage Left is still one of the best live albums.
True--Jacob's Ladder is a great song.
Best song on there, man.
Their first album was good.
Indeed--Working Man, good song.
