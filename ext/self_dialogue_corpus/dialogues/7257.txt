Have you ever seen the movie Bambi?
Yes! I loved that movie.
I used to watch it all the time as a child.
It was so sad when Bambi's mother dies.
I agree, I will never forget about that scene.
Disney movies normally don't have such sad scenes.
I think it was an important scene in the plot.
I do too, and I am glad it was included.
I can't wait to watch Bambi with my own kids one day.
I think I will watch it with my kids tonight!
