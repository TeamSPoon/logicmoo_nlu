Freddie Mercury of Queen had one amazing voice.
Oh yes he did.
He could hit such a range of notes. Bohemian Rhapsody was a great song.
It sure was and still is today.
I remember a duet that he did with David Bowie. It was the song Under Pressure.
Oh yea I have seen that!
That is one of my favorite duets.
It is a shame that he died.
It seems all the super talented ones have passed away early.
I know, such a waste of talent.
