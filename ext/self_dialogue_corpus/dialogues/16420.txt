I was just listening to Sammy Hagar, do you like his music?
Yes, he's good.
He's been around a long time.
Yea since the eightees, right?
No, he actually started in the seventies, but got popular later on.
I didn't know that he played that much longer.
Yes, I saw him on his VOA tour.
You were lucky, that was a great album.
Three Lock Box is my all time favorite by him.
That is good.
Theres just so many good ones, hard to choose sometimes.
So many great albums, you could just hit play on a playlist and let them all go.
We also saw him a few years ago, it was great.
Did you have good seats?
Yes and VIP tickets so we really enjoyed it.
Did he play Heavy Metal?
Yes he did and the crowd went nuts.
I bet, I would love to see him.
His music is still good, all these years later.
Yea he definitely left his mark on music.
