Britney Spears. Is she still around?
I believe so. I've heard a lot of people talking about listening to new music from her. I believe it's new music.
Oh. She seemed to go disappear a decade ago.
She's definitely not as popular as she once was.
That's for sure. She was the top pop artist at one time.
Yes, late 1990s and early 2000s.
Yes, that time period. She's getting older as well. That must be why I haven't heard much from her lately.
Other artists that are younger seem to be getting much more play time it seems.
I couldn't name any of those new artists. I guess I'm getting older as well.
We all are. Our lives get busier as well and it's more difficult to keep up with the latest music.
