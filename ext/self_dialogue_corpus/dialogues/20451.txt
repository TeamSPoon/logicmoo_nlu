Did you ever see 50 first dates?
No, is that a romantic comedy?
You could call it that, but it is one of Adam Sandler's best films.
Who else is in it?
Drew Barrymore stars as well.
Ok they could be funny together.
Yes they did a great job in this, it is a great story.
Is it a love story?
You could say that, but it is shot on a beach and also very funny.
Ok that does sound good.
Adam Sandler is really at his best in this film.
Ok I like to hear that.
Drew Barrymore does a great job in this too, it is all so believable and mirrors life.
What do you mean?
The interactions between couples or people that are dating are the same dynamics shown in this film.
Wow so you can even learn something about human relationships from this film?
Yes you are correct.
That just adds another element to the film then.
Exactly, it is funny because it is true, it is great.
Ok thank you for the recommendation.
