Aren't you about sick of superhero movies by now?
A little bit.  I never saw Dr. Stranger.
It was okay, but I'm losing track of all these Marvel movies.
I think Black Panther is coming out soon.
Why am I not surprised.  Are they even trying at this point?
That could be an interesting one since he's from Africa.
Look, I'll see it, just getting a bit repetitious.
Yeah, but when they make hundreds of millions of dollars, who's going to stop them?
I know, I know.  Just hope they start making better quality and not quantity.
Me too.  Maybe this will turn the tide.
