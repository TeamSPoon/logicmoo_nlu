What is your favorite Tarrentino film?
I really like Pulp Fiction.
A classic for sure!
Travolta's come back performance.
Oh yeah. Him opposite Jackson!
"...and you will know my name is the Lord!"
Too hillarious.
And then he has a religious awakening.
Talk about irony!
And how about Uma?
She was so sexy.
I know, and she's not even close to my type.
That woman is everyone's type.
Bruce Willis was even in it.
I forgot about that! The Boxer, right?
Yup. Very good.
I'm gonna have to watch that one again.
I own it.
Could I borrow it?
Even better, come over and we'll watch it.
