You pumped for the Eagles this season?
Yeah! This is Carson Wentz's year!
Now that he has Alshon Jefferey as a target, he will be so much better.
Also having a deep threat like Torrey Smith will help
Nelson Agalhor has looked good in workouts too.
I know, but I need to see more from him before I believe it.
I don't think he will ever be more than a slot option, but I am just hoping he won't be a first round bust forever
We can hope. We are Philly fans after all.
What do you think the Cowboys will do?
Ah, I think Dak Prescott is due for a regression.
Me too. I think it'll be the Birds and the Boys fighting for the East
As much as I hate to say it, don't sleep on the Giants.
Why you say that?
Their defense, man. That is a sick unit that will keep them in games all year.
That's true, but I hate them so much.
At leas they beat the Pats a couple of times.
I know. They broke up the perfect season. At least there's that
Couldn't have happened to a better bunch. Those Pats are cheaters.
Totally with you! Bellicheck is a great coach but a horrible dude.
Tom Brady is a tool too.
