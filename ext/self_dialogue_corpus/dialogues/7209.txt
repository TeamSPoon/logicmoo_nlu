I want to get my great nephew started on watching animated Disney films.
Because you love them yourself?
Yes. I grew up on them, I brought my niece to most of them now I want to show her son how great they are.
I know what you mean, it's a right of passage.
I may start with 101 Dalmatians. He loves puppies.
And Dalmatians are the cutest!
It's a fun movie, I'd want him to see live version with Glen Clse also, But when he's older. She was so good it was scary!
That is true. She really chewed up the scenery didn't she?
She's a great actress.
Let me know how your great nephew likes it.
