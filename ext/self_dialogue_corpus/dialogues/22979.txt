Do you like Holiday movies?
I like funny ones.
Like National Lampoons?
The ones with Chevy Chase, yes.
You know, there is even a newer one.
Really?
Yes, it had Ed helms in it.
Oh, I liked the vacation one.
Which one?
The one when the went to Europe.
Oh, that was so funny.
I loved the Vegas one.
I liked the cameos in that one.
I liked when Rusty ended up winning so much money.
Do you like other Chevy Chase movies?
I think the Caddy Shack is one of the best he ever made.
Did you like him in Spies Like Us?
That was such a funny buddy comedy.
The situational humor was so good.
All those cold war comedies always make me laugh.
