He did a good job in the acting
Do you like his acting or music better
In the movie he did well but the soundtrack is one of his best works

Excellent movie and Tupac should have got a award for his acting.

Yes but mot as good as Above the rim

They had lots of old school music like james brown. The music was better than the movie

Yes I think that Ju=esus Christ Superstar was another good one
