Have you had a chance to see the new live-action Beauty and the Beast movie?
Yes! I absolutely loved it!  What did you think of it?
I definitely think that nothing could replace the animated film, but it was incredible!
The only issue was I wish they had a stronger singer for Belle than Emma Watson.
I agree.  She was a perfect choice for personality and acting, but the singing seemed to fall short
Especially since the rest of the cast was so phenomenal!
I know!  Dan Stevens and Josh Gad were amazing!
And Luke Evans as Gaston - perfect choice!
