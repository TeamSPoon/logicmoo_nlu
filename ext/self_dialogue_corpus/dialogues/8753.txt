Do you like Metallica?
I like Metallica before the Black Album.
What is your favorite song?
I can't pick just one song but I like to play the entire Master of Puppets album from start to finish.
My favorite song is "The Four Horsemen"
Did you know that Dave Mustaine wrote that before he was kicked out of the band, then used it in his new band Megadeth as "The Mechanix"
Actually it was "The Mechanix" first. Metallica then modified it into "The Four Horsemen" after Dave Mustaine had left.
That's cool! Which one do you like better?
I like "The Four Horsemen" better. The added melodic solo at the end gives it a new flair.
You find Metallica playing "The Mechanix" in the early 80's on Youtube before Dave Mustaine left the band.
