I just saw Elle Fanning in a preview for an upcoming movie. She's grown up since I saw her in Maleficent.
DIdn't you just love that movie, Maleficent? I sure did.
Yes, I wish they would do another one.
They could have Elle's character, Princess Aurora, all grown up now.
That would be cool, and that bird guy that helps Maleficent could be in it still.
Well sure. They should have all the original characters, including Sleeping Beauty's father.
Did he live at the end? I can't remember.
You mean King Stefan? No he died at the end. But...hmmm...
I know! He could have a twin brother who shows up to claim he owns the kingdom or somthing...
Yes that might work. As long as they keep Angelina Jolie at Maleficent. She's great!
