What movie did you take the kids to see last weekend?
My son was really interested in the Power Rangers Movie.
Your daughter was okay with seeing it?
We were both unsure, but our curiousity won out.
What did you think?  Was it like those bad tv episodes?
Actually, it was really good.
I heard that Elizabeth Banks is the bad guy/ girl whatever.
She was, my son loves her from the Lego Movie so he was laughing at her voice when she tried to sound threatening.
But was it the same old rubber costumes with the mouths that don't move?
Nope.  She just had a bunch of make up on.  She was good
Awesome.  I don't think I know anyone else who was in the movie.
Actually, I liked that too.  They weren't big name actors, but they were familiar
Really?  Like from other shows or movies.
Yes, the pink ranger was actually an actress from a kids' movie called Lemonade Mouth.
Naomi Scott?  No way!  I didn't realize she was in the movie too.
I know.  My daughter was so excited to recognize her.
Very cool.  I may have to check it out.
It had some positive messages about inclusion as well.
Really?  Like what?
Well, one of the rangers admitted that he was on the "spectrum" and explained that he thinks differently.
