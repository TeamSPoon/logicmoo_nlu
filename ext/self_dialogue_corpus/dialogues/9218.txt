Do you like Cake?
Eating cake?
No, the band.  Have you ever heard of them?
Oh, yeah!  I had one of their CDs back in high school.
Me too!  Which one did you have?
I think it was called "Prolonging the Magic."  There was a picture of a pig on the case.
I think that was the one I had, but I'm not sure.
I know that the biggest song on it was "Never There."
I don't know.  I think I had the one with "The Distance."
I think that was another album.
