Hey, did you see this movie about contacting or speaking with aliens? It's quite new.
Do you mean "Arrival"?
Yes, that's the one!
Yes, I saw it a couple of months ago. Great movie.
It was so cool! I loved the new perspective they gave to aliens visiting Earth.
Yes, it was very well thought of.
And the cast was great too.
Yes, this Amy Adams girl keeps killing it in every movie she is in.
Yeah, right? And what about the guy who is also on the latest "Mission Impossible" movies?
Yes, Jeremy Renner I believe is his name. He is also great.
Yeah, I loved how they got along on screen.
Man, but isin't it strange to you that in alien movies, humans always try to kill them...
Yeah, that is one of the things I liked about this one. That it shows how maybe if aliens come to Earth it would be to help us.
Absolutely. I also liked that approach.
And the whole movie was quite intelligent. I liked the reasoning of all the aspects of it.
Yes, it also made me think a lot.
It was suprisingly good, since every time I go see an alien movie I expect more of the same.
Definitely this one brought something new to the table.
I thought it should have won "Best Picture" at the "Oscars".
Well, I don't know if I would go that far...
