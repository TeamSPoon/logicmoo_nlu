Who is your all time favorite rock band  ?
really hard to narrow it down to 1 . gun to the head Iwould pick Van Halen
well now the obvious follow up.  David Lee Roth or Sammy Hagar  Van  Halen ?
Definitely Sammy !  DLR  was more of a showman  Hagar is more of a musician
My favorite Van Halen tune is Jump  I think it was Diamond Dave
yes it was they were so  so stoned in that video
haha  yes the 80s were fun I think thats why I still love 80s rock
well that and it was the best music of any generation
that is for sure . My favorite song is  is Aerosmith's  Angel
I was just going to ask you who yours was.  Wow I have not heard that 1 in a while
