I cannot believe how well the Arizona Coyotes have been playing this season.
Give me an example of when they have played well.
They beat the Sundogs last month.
I suppose that's true.
What's your opinion of them overall?
I think they've got some good players but I'm not so sure about the new coach.
What's up with the new coach?
I've seen him give some really poor advice to his players.
But every coach will give bad advice sometimes.
He should be more professional and make fewer mistakes with the team.
So which team has impressed you this season?
I am in awe of the Phoenix Polar Bears.
Yeah, but the Polar Bears used to be so much better.
When did you last see them play?
I saw them last season. They weren't that great.
They have been playing a lot better this season.
Why do you think that is?
I think they got the right coach behind them.
The coach is everything with you, isn't it?
That's the most important person on the team.
