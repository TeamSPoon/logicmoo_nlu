Did you watch the Julia Robert's movie, "Secret in Their Eyes?"
I actually just watched that the other week. Wow, I was totally blown away.
I know I wouldn't pick her for a thriller style movie, but man did she deliver.
I know, I'm so used to her playing such wholesome roles, like "Eat,Pray, Love" and "Stepmom" that this was a real surprise.
I really didn't think she had it in her, but she aced it.
I agree, it was like "Silence of the Lambs" meets "Misery."
Oh wow, that is the perfect description!
She doesn't have that Kathy Bates crazy in her eyes, but there was something there.
I hope she does more movies like this, it was great to see her out of her comfort zone.
I agree. Who knew Julia Roberts could be so scary?
