Have you ever seen Harry Potter?
Like the wizard movies? Yeah why?
Finally got around to seeing one of them the other day. Don't get what the fuss was about.
I mean they're pretty good kids movies I guess?
It just didn't make sense ya know? Like why do I care about this wizard guy getting killed?
Wait, what movie did you watch?
Harry Potter! you know where Snake kills Dumblebore.
That's the sixth movie.
Oh. Well.... never mind then
Whatever man.
