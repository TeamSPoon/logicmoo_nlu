I just watched Cool Runnings today , such a good movie
I forgot about that !
I watched it when I was younger, it is so funny
I know , I used to want to bobsled
same here, once my brother and I made a trail with our sleds in the snow
what did you do with the sleds?
we would run and jump in them and pretend to bobsled
The Olympics were so much fun when we were kids
I know, because you could imagine what you would do
That is true, I wanted to figure skate
