Do you like Will Ferrell movies?
I don't think I've seen a Will Ferrell movie that I didn't like.
Same here.  Anchorman is my favorite.
That's a good one!  Anchorman 2 was pretty bad though.
I thought it was okay.  It wasn't as good as the first, but I felt it still had some funny parts.
I just felt that they tried a little too hard.
Yeah you're probably right.  I feel that the first didn't really end in a way that would allow a very good sequel.
Have you seen Land of the Lost?  I felt that that was a pretty bad Will Ferrell movie.
I haven't seen it, but my girlfriend told me it was bad.
Yeah it's bad.  It was quite poorly written and I don't recall laughing out loud at any point during it.
