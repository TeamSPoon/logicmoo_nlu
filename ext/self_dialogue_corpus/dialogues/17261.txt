Kendrick Lamar is the most influential poet of our times.
Poet? You mean rapper?
Rap is poetry my friend.
True that.
Have you listened to his album, to pimp a butterfly.
No I haven't I heard it wasn't that good.
There are a lot of haters, but you have to just sit down and try to appreciate it.
What is it about?
Well to pimp a butterfly is kind of a metaphor for African American beauty being sold, or pimped out.
Interesting.
Yeah it really is interest. Kendrick really takes a dark, long stare at his own race.
Is it negative to Black people?
Not really. It just keeps things real.
So why is he the greatest poet.
Well in this album, and his others. He calls out the problem, and he asks his people to fix the problem.
Do you think people will actually fix their problems?
Maybe. One can hope right?
I hope so. African Americans are in a pretty bad place in America right now.
That's true. The news is crazy.
You can say that again.
