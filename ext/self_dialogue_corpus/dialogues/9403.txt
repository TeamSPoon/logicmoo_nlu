Who was the guy that had the song Wild Thing?
I think it was Tone Loc.
Yeah, that was it!
What was his other song?
Funky Cold Medina?
Yeah, that was it.
Didn't he have a weird voice?
I don't know if it was weird, but it was distinguished.
Yeah, that's what I meant.  He had a deep voice.
Yeah, you definately knew it was him.
