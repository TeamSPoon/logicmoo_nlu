Did you ever notice that nobody worries about Jasmine when she goes missing in Aladdin?
What do you mean?
She snuck out of the house to go into the village and nobody noticed.
Didn't the guards find her?  Isn't that why they went into the city?
No, Jafar sent the guards to find Aladdin.  They found Jasmine by accident!
I never thought of that!  Maybe they thought she was still in the castle?
Maybe, but that castle was pretty poorly guarded.  She didn't see any guards on her way out and climbed that wall easily!
Maybe they trusted the people??
I guess, but it seems a little strange that she was the princess and fairly unguarded.
A little odd, but it sure made for a great movie!
