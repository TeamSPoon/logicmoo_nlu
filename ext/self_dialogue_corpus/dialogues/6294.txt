Is Finding Nemo a Disney movie?
Yeah.
Wait, I thought it was Pixar.
Disney bought Pixar a while ago.
Wow. So Cars is a Disney movie too?
It sure is.
Wow. Ok, Lightning McQueen is my new favorite Disney princess.
Haha. I don't think he counts.
Hey, men can be princesses too!
He's not a man, he's a car!
