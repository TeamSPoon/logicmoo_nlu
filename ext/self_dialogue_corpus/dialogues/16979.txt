Have you heard of LMFAO?
Doesn't that mean in short laughing?
Yes but it also is a music band.
Really, i've never heard of them.
Ever heard of party rock anthem?
Yes I love that song.
They made it.
Really?
Yep along with some other music.
I am surprised I didn't know that, I guess I just never thought to look who made the music.
Do you want to listen to some of their other music tonight?
Sure, I think i'll like it.
It's all kind of funny songs but they're well done.
That sounds good to me.
Do you want me to bring over my mp3 player to your place?
Yes, I also have a stereo we can hook it up to.
That sounds fantastic.
I'll get some things from the store too.
Let's party hard!
I see what you did there.
