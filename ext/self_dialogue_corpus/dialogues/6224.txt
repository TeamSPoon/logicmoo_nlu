Do you remember the Disney movie "The Little Mermaid?"
Oh, yeah. It's a classic. It was one of my favorites as a kid.
Me, too. My favorite character was Ariel. She sang beautifully.
I liked Ariel too, but my favorite character was Flounder.
He was really cute. He always got so scared in the different scenes.
What did you think of the crab?
You mean, Sebastian? He was a cute character. He had a great accent.
One of my favorite characters was Scuttle the seagull.
I know. He was really funny, right?
I thought he was kind of on the dingy side. But, it made the movie comical.
