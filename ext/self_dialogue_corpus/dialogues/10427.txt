Some kind of weather we've been having lately.
No kidding; one minute it's pouring and the next minute it's scorching!
Yeah, it reminds me of that song about extremes.
Which song is that?
It's the one where the singer says something like you're hot and you're cold.
You're yes and you're no?
Yeah that's the one! Who's it by?
I think that's a Katy Perry song.
You're in then you're out... yeah, that's a fun song.
Hard to believe it came out almost ten years ago.
Wait, really??
Yeah, it came out in 2008.
Wow. Whatever happened to her?
Actually her next album's about to come out.
No kidding! What's it called?
Witness, it's supposed to come out June 9th.
Huh. Didn't she have a single come out recently for it?
Yeah, Chained to the Rhythm.
I knew it! I'll have to check it out, she has some good songs.
Well, she's kinda hit or miss, but yeah, you should.
