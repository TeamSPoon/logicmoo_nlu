Who do you think is the best comedic actor?
Wow, that's a good question.
I think Jim Carrey use to be.
Why don't you think he is now?
He became to serious once he did The Truman Show.
Have you seen that abomination called The Majestic?
No, me and the rest of the world have not seen The Majestic.
Oh, that movie is horrible.
Is it so bad it's good?
No, it's just bad.
