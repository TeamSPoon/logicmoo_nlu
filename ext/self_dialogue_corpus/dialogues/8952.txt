Do you listen to Japanese rock music?
A little. I like X-Japan.
I love that band, and Yoshiki especially.
He is a good drummer and his English is amazing.
I also like that Sugizo is a member now.
What band was he in before?
He was in Luna Sea.
His electric violin adds a lot to the band.
Have you seen the documentary "We are X"?
Not yet, but my friend was at one of the concerts they filmed.
