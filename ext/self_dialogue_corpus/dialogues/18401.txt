Do you know the artist seal?
Yes. I enjoy him.
I just found out he was married to heidi klum. I had no clue!
Really? I thought that was common knowledge.
Not to me. I am so surprised.
They are divorced now but have kids together.
I bet they are so good looking.
They are. What is your favorite seal song?
Is it a cliche to say kiss from a rose ?
No, most people love it.
I like Prayer for the Dying.
That is also enjoyable to listen to.
Maybe didn't have the exposure like kiss from a rose.
I think any song featured in a big movie gets a lot more attention.
Also "Kiss " was a highly good track, It won grammy award for Record of the year and a grammy for Song of the Year.
It deserved them. Still good.
It is though for a while was over played.
YA, but that is true for most hits.
True, once the mania dies down I tend to enjoy them more again.
Agreed and very true statement on all music for me.
