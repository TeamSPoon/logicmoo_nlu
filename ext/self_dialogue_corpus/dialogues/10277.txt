Do you like Stallone movies?
Oh yeah for sure.
What is your favorite?
I like Rambo
All of them or one in particular
The first one is the best. He destroys that small town.
Oh yeah, rebel drifter without a home
Right, shows those local cops who the boss is
A lot of blow ups towards the end
That's for sure.
