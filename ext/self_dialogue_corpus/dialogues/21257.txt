What is your favorite spooky movie?
Spooky or scary?
Either
Spooky and scary sound the same. How about favorite Horror movie?
My favorite HORROR movie is The made for TV movie from 1990 Nightmare on the 13th Floor.
Is that on YouTube? My VCR is broke.
What's your favorite horror movie?
Cannibal holocaust is pretty nasty.
Cannibal Holicaust isn't really a horror flick
Well it's horrific.
The animal rights violations are horrific.
I also enjoy the made for TV movie IT
IT's remake is about to hit theaters this September
The trailer looks spooky for IT but the clown looks kinda funky.
The "penny dreadful" version.
Tim Curry could've played the clown in the remake.
He should've.
IT was an okay for TV movie, but those other Stephen King tv adaptations were horrible!
The Langoliers had horrible special "effects"
Very dubious.
