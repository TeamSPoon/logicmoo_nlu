Have you heard? Caesar is back!
What are you going on about now?
Caesar from Planet of the Apes.
They're doing another Planet of the Apes movie?
Yes, War for the Planet of the Apes.  It will be out in a few more weeks.
I hadn't heard anything about this.
You hadn't heard? Where have you been?
Well, I do work nights and I don't have much time to watch television.
Makes sense.
What's the story about in this one?
Caesar and his apes are forced into a deadly conflict with an army of humans led by a ruthless colonel.
Always somebody, human I mean, causing problems.
You think they would have learned after the first movie.
Humans never learn. Look at the real world around you.
This colonel is going to kill some of Caesar's people? I mean kind.
Man, Caesar is going to suffer an  unimaginable loss regarding his apes.
This is going to drive him to go to war against the humans.
They say Caesar will wrestle with his darker instincts and begin his own mythic quest to avenge his kind.
I hope those apes win. I have make sure I see that movie.
Tell me about. I hope Caesar kills that crazy colonel and sends a message to the rest of human kind in the movie.
