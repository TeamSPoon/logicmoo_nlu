What's your favourite movie?
I've had different favourites over the years. Let's see, I'd have to say the Princess Bride.
Why's that?
It has so many classic scenes, and characters, and lines, it's funny, emotional and exciting.
It sounds pretty good.
What about you?
I'm a big Lord of the Rings fan.
Oh okay. I don't remember much about it except Liv Tyler was in them.
Would you be interested in watching them again with me sometime?
Yeah I'm definitely about that, especially seeing my girl Liv Tyler.
I think they're best watched back to back.
That's how I watched them years ago.
Yeah, I think it really helps with the storyline and everything to have a little marathon.
Mhmm, otherwise I'd have to rewatch the end of the previous one to keep it fresh in my head.
There definitely is a lot to keep track of.
I feel like I need more info on the characters and the plot written down to be able to understand everything well.
You know, there are resources like that you can find online.
That would help me a ton.
Yeah, I lost the stuff I had but we can find it again.
That would make all the difference. I'm ready for a marathon!
