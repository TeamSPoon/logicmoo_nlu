Time travel is so weird in movies. It's hard to keep track of what's what.
I don't know about that. Some time travel movies are pretty easy to follow.
Well, let me give you an example: The Terminator. That's a movie with a hard to follow mythology.
Actually, The Terminator is pretty straightforward.
The first one is, but after that it gets confusing.
Break it down for me.
The first one is a closed loop, right? Machine goes back to kill Sarah Connor, fails, but creates Skynet in the process.
And John Connor, too, of course. You forgot that.
Right, well, come the second film, apparently time travel allows you to create history. The rules of the first film don't apply anymore.
That's true, they do prevent Judgement Day in that movie.
Yeah, but then in the third film, it turns out you can't change the future, you can only delay it. What's inevitable will always happen.
That does seem to kind of conflict with both prior films, honestly. What happens in the fourth?
A lot of weird Terminator-Human hybrid stuff, but nothing time travel related, so we can skip right to the fifth film.
What happens in that one? I've never seen it.
In that one, following the events of the other four films time travel happens, and the past is changed, meaning none of them ever happened.
Oh, okay. That's confusing.
Yep, but Judgement Day is still happening, but in modern time when Kyle Reese is a child. And he remembers the events as they happen to him as a child as an adult.
Okay, just stop. Just stop, that's too much.
Now you finally see my point. Time travel in movies is weird, and Terminator is only one example.
I don't want to hear any other examples. This is making my head spin enough as is!
