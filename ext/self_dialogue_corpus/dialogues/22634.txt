did you see where the wild things are?
the movie was great
it didnt have much of a story though
have you read the book? it didnt need much of a story
i guess the focus was on the graphics
they did that super well
it looked real and it was awesome
the scenary was beautiful
the monsters looked huge and pretty cool.
the cinematographer deserves a clap
give him a standing ovation
i dont know how well the movie did though
i think it did alright in the charts
that book was a part of a lot of peoples childhood
i wonder if they are going to do the giving tree movie
i dont know if thatd make sense
yeah, its so simple
not much happens in it
theres nothing to go off on to make a hour long movie
you are right there
