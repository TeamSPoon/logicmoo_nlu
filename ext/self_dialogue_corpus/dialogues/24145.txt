I'm a big James Dean fan.
Really? Didn't he only do a couple of movies?
He completed three, though his last two, "Rebel Without a Cause" and "Giant" came out after he died.
What was the other one he did?
"East of Eden," which was the adaptation of John Steinbeck's novel.
So the iconic image of him in the red jacket and jeans, which is that from?
That's from "Rebel Without a Cause." It came out in 1955 and was kind of like "The Breakfast Club" of that time.
How do you mean? In what way?
It was focused on the plight of teenagers and how misunderstood they are by adults, but from a teen's point of view.
Oh I see. Who else was in the movie?
Natalie Wood and Sal Mineo were the other main stars, though Dennis Hopper and Jim Backus were in it as supporting players.
Doesn't James Dean's character kill someone in the movie?
No, though he's involved in a car race, or a "chicken race" and the other guy's door sticks. He ends up going over the cliff and dying.
Dang, that's a tough way to go.
The other guy's friends tried to put the blame on Dean's character, but really no one but bad luck could be blamed.
Did he get arrested?
No, he had befriended a detective or something who was more interested in getting the whole story rather than assuming the worst.
So someone finally took a chance on him.
Yeah his parents either ignored him or patronized him so it was good to finally have an adult guide him.
Sounds like a more complex movie than I thought.
