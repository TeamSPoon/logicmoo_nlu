How do you like country music.
I pretty much don't like it.
Not a fan either.
Songs all sound the same to me.
All about the same things too.
Yes they are.
Usually about pickup trucks,girlfriends,shotguns.
You're so right.
Same old stuff by a lot of different singers.
I like the old country music.
Yes,me,too.
Give me Merl Haggard,Johnny Cash any day.
My favorite is Glen Campbell.
Absolutely love Glen Campbell.
Rhinestone Cowboy was my favorite song.
