Tomorrowland should have been a much better movie then it was.
I was so excited to catch it and then was so disappointed, I agree.
What problems did you have with Tomorrowland?
For me, I really liked the concept of turning what we know of Tomorrowland into a movie, but I thought the delivery of the storyline was a bit too much.
Do you mean the George Clooney relationship with the girl?
I actually liked that aspect eventhough people thought it was somewhat controversial. I thought it was heartwarming that he had a crush on her as a kid, but seeing as she was a robot she wasn't going to age while he would.
I didn't mind it either and I thought the dynamic of their relationship was really interesting. Overall the movie was fun but it lacked more coherence for me.
Britt Robertson was almost like a throw away character in there even though she was the billing lead name.
I know, her character was pretty disappointing. I didn't like the Hugh Laurie stuff either, that was weird.
Brad Bird directed it, director of the Incredibles, and while I think he did a good job directing the movie, the story could have improved it overall so much more.
