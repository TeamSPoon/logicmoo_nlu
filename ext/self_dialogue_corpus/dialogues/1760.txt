What's the worst "dagger to the heart" that you have experienced watching football?
Watching Ricardo Lockett get hit made me feel sick. I felt like I just watched someone get paralyzed. I'm glad he's alright.
Why or why not does your team  need a new stadium?
RCA stadium? It'll never change. It'll probably outlast the NFL.
If someone you secretly disliked was thinking about becoming a fan of your team, how would you describe your team to them so that they didn't want to root for them?
If I disliked someone I'd want them to root for my team so they could suffer too.
Who would you rather have on your team going forward, Julio Jones or OBJ?
I'd take Julio because that means Atlanta wouldn't have him anymore
What unpopular prediction about the 2016 season did you get correct?
I had the Lions getting the 6 seed believe it or not. Everyone thought without Megatron they'd be 5-11.
Stafford proved last season that he could play well when Johnson was injured
It's the history of the team. The Lions haven't been a consistent team since the 50's so when the generational talent leaves the team people expect them to regress.
Who is the least athletic player to play well at a skill position?
I mean Marques Colston never wowed anyone with his athletic ability but still became the Saints all-time leading WR in every category.
I feel like Peyton Manning wasn't really athletic, he just had a cannon and was accurate
Along that same note, there's a reason Brady wasn't chosen til the 6th round.
What players do you believe had the best Mechanics,Technique, Football IQ?
Prime Revis had the best combination of iq, technique, athleticism and ability to hold with getting penalized I've seen from a corner.
If You can change one draft pick for your team in the past 10 years, who is it?
Derek Carr instead of Kyle Fuller.
