Did you see La La Land?
No, I never did, but I wanted to.
I really liked it, you should definitely see it. I thought it started a little slow, but by the end, I was really into it.
Okay, I'll try to see it then. I really like Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone.
I like them both, too, but especially Ryan!
Well, then, you probably saw Lars and the Real Girl.
I haven't, actually, but I've heard a lot about it.
It's one of my favorite movies. It's funny, but also serious in parts and very sweet.
Sounds good. I even have the DVD, so I'll have to watch it soon.
Speaking of favorite movies, I heard you haven't seen one of mine - The Shawshank Redemption.
It's true, I haven't, but a friend got it for me and I've been meaning to watch it.
You should. I think it's on most people's Top 10 List. I think it's in my Top 5.
Was it really based on a book by Stephan King?
Yes, not one of his longer books, but more like a novella. It's written so well and the movie is very faithful to the book.
Who's in it?
The two main stars are Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman. Morgan Freeman narrated the movie.
He has a terrific voice for that.
He does. It's a great story with great characters and great acting.
I can't wait to see it. I loved Tim Robbins in Bull Durham.
Me, too, but this is a totally different character and he does a great job. This is the kind of movie I can watch over and over and over again and not get tired of it.
