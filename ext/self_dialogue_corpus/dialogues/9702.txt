Do you like newer rap?
No, I think the 90's stuff is untouchable.
I agree. The new stuff does not have a good sound.
Back in the day we had Ice Cube and Easy E and Eminem
They put out tons of classics
Ueah, the new stuff just does not have a very musical feel
Yeah, it doesn't have good beats.
Do you like Soulja Boy?
I'm not a fan. I prefer the oldies like Dre.
yeah, Eminem and Easy- E were very special rappers.
