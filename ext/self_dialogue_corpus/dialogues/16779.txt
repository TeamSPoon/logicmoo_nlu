Hey, turn on the radio. Justmake sure it's not that country garbage you listen to,
Why are you always hating on country? It has a lot to offer its listeners.
Yeah, like what. It's just songs about losing your woman, truck, or dog.
Some of the most pupular muscians today started out in country.
Yeah, right. Like who.
Taylor Swift ans Shania Twain to name a few.
OK, but they got out of country. That proves it not good music if even its stars want out of the genre when they get popular.
Acutally, there are a few singers who went into country music after hitting it big.
No way! That's not true.
Darius Rucker of Hootie and the Blowfish went into country after his pop success.
Bet you can't name anymore.
You're going to lose your money making bets like that. Some more artists who went country are Nelly, Bret Michaels of Poison, Tina Turner, and Cyndi Lauper.
Glad that I didn't wager any extra money, but I am still not convinced. You're going to have to make a stronger argument than that.
Country is easy listening. You don't have to worry about offending anyone if you want to sing the lyrics out loud.
Well, that's true. What other reasons do you have?
I know you said that it's all about heartbreak over trucks, dogd, and women, but at least that's real emotion. It's not about trivial things like sneakers or cars.
I never thought about it that way.
And it can be the perfect party music. Some of those heartbreak songs are fast paced, and they are the perfect summer party songs.
Still not convinced. Give me one more reason.
As a woman, you should be proud of a genre that has elevated women so high up in the industry. The most popular and profitable singers in the genre are almost ALL women
