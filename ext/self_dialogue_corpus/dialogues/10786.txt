Do you want to know what I don't understand about Fast and the Furious?
What's that?
Why is it that after eight movies, and showcasing classic, American and import cars, I've never seen a Jeep Wrangler featured.
You probably haven't seen one because because Jeeps are notoriously slow. The movie is called Fast and The Furious not Slow and the Curious.
You're probably right. However, I can definitely Hobbs or Shaw sporting one!
Yeah! Especially in the latest movie, Fast and Furious 8!
What happened in that one?
Well, as the team was trying to stop the hacker in Russia from stealing a submarine with bombs, they were caught by the Russian military. There was snow everywhere.
Oh really? That would've been perfect for a Jeep!
Well maybe they will in the next one, Fast and the Furious 9!
