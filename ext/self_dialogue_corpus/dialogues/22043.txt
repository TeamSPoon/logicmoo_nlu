So you told me you don't  like traditional Hollywood musicals, but you like Phantom of the Opera and Mama Mia.
Right.
So any other movie musicals that you like.
Fiddler on the Roof.
Well, that is a classic.
The music and the story line are wonderful.
Yes, how the father bends and bends to accept his daughters' choices...
And finally can bend no more.
Topol was amazing as Tevye.
Yes, I saw a stage version with Zero Mostel, who was known for the part, but to me, not as good.
I have seen Topol without the beard and you can hardly see him as Tevye.
Yes, he looks so different and I don't think he's done anything nearly as memorable in his career.
What about the movie daughters.
They were all beautiful.
Well, Tzeitel was plain but you come to see her as beautiful, but Hodel was a beauty.
And Chava; you had to love her.
And has there ever been a funnier scene than when Tevye thought the butcher wanted his milk cow when he actually wanted his daughter.
I still laugh and laugh every time I see it.
Do you know that movie was made over 45 years ago?
We are getting old my friend.
