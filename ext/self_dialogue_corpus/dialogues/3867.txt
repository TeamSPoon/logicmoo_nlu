Did you see the movie gone girl?
Yes, what did you think?
I am torn, I think I prefer the book.
I enjoyed both. I think they both were suspenseful.
Yes, I felt both were overhyped though.
Gone girl was a hugely popular in general.
I actually think Dark Places by the same author was a better book and movie.
It did not get the same attention which is too bad because it was good.
Yes chloe grace mortez was really great in that role.
I really liked the actor who played the young Trey Teepano.
