Have you seen that Lady Gaga music video?
Do you mean MILLION REASONS?
Yes, it made me cry.
Yeah, it was like how she feels.
She has a hard job.
She is always busy.
But she just needed one good reason to stay.
It was cool to see her getting ready for the show.
And to see things from her perspective.
I am glad she is staying.
