So, would you like to hear some Snoop Dogg?
Yes. He is one of my favorite rappers.
Do you have any CD's he put out?
Yes. I loved his early work and also his later work.
Did you ever hear Doddystyle?
That is the first album I bought. I got it in 1993.
That was a great one.
Did you ever hear The Last Meal?
I did not. But, we can probably get it on Amazon.
Let's get Over the Counter too.
