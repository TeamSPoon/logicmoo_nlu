Who is your favorite rock band?
I really love The Pixies. I have all of their albums!
They're one of my favorites too. Have you ever seen them in concert?
I've seen them a handful of times, they put on a really solid show.
Are Frank Black and Kim Deal getting along these days?
I've heard that they're not touring again because Frank and Kim got into it again.
That's not entirely surprising.
No, what's surprising is that they haven't killed each other yet!
I know, I've heard they fight like crazy.
They do. Frank's kicked Kim out so many times.
I wonder why she keeps coming back to the band?
Maybe its a love hate relationship? Except we only really hear about the hate part.
That's probably at least close to the truth.
I remember at one show I saw them at, Frank made fun of Kim almost the entire time.
Did she at least go back at him?
Nah, she mostly took it in stride and laughed it off.
I imagine she's probably used to it by now.
He does seem like a pretty tough guy to work with.
He wants to be a rock star and he probably doesn't like it when he's not the center of attention.
Maybe that's why he booted Kim when she started to branch out to a side project.
