Did you see Cinderella yet?
Are you talking the cartoon?
No, the newer movie that came out a few years back.
Ah, yes, yes I did.  It was quite good!

The costumes were really well done.  Her dress looked beautiful.
I think her dress was pink, right?
No, at the ball it was blue.

Probably so.  She's nothing like Aurora.
