Did you ever watch the movie Mulan?
I don't think so. Who's in it?
Well, I'm not sure. It's a Disney movie.
Well, then no I didn't.
It's about a daughter who dresses up as a son to go fight in war so her father doesn't have to.
So she's not a princess in the movie?
No, she's a warrior.
Well, women can do anything.
That was the point. Showing how strong a woman can be, I think.
I never actually heard of that one.
