Hi!
Hi....
How's it going?
Good.
Uhhh, so what are you doing right now?
Oh, just lookin' at MetLife Stadium!
Oh really.
Yeah, heard they're gonna make some renovations to it!
Oh yeah, from whom?
From the Director of NFL himself.
How so?
They say, that they're improving it for some hunk-a-junk bout the Super Bowl, but I don't believe that.
Then why do you think they're really changing MetLife for?
Hmmm, not sure.
What's on your mind?
Most likely, the fact that they're just renovating it for the Jets!
Huh, makes sense.
I overheard some complaints coming from some of the players themselves.
About what?
I'll tell you more, once we get out of this joint.
