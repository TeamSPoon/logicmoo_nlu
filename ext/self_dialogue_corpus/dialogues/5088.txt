Who do you think has the best farm system in baseball?
Well you could say the Yankees.
Its amazing considering how they used to be.
I know, when did they ever have a farm system?
Well it used to be all other MLB teams.
I think we have passed that time in baseball.
Yeah, teams are smartening up with that.
Well they are just giving out extensions earlier on so players arent costing as much
But salaries are rising so I think you are confused
Yeah a few get those massive deals but for the most part theyre cheap in the beginning
Thats always been how it is.
I dont think you are understanding me.
I am, you are saying they are locking guys up.
Yeah, so theyre cheaper.
Not really, arbitration years are usually inexpensive.
Well you dont have to pay the premium at 23.
But you are paying them when they are hitting their prime.
So there will be a half billion player soon enough?
I think two - Trout and Harper
No way, thats too bogus
