Do you remember the movie The Stand?
The one based off a Stephen King novel?
I think it might have been.
Oh, it definately was.  They ran it as a TV series.
Did you like it?
It was okay, I guess.  I watch it every couple years.
I loved it!  Why did you only think it was okay?
I read the book.  The book was much better.
Oh, was there much more in the book?
There was more about the plague and random deaths.  There was a lot more background on the characters too.
