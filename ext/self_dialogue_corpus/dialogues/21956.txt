Adam Sandler is an underrated actor
He is a really good comedian
Which is why his comedy movies do so well
Have you seen 8 crazy nights?
No, what is that?
It's an animated film abot hannukah with Adam Sandler
It sounds interesting.
I also loved Happy Gilmore
A classic sports underdog movie!
What was your favorite part?
I liked when Happy would just start flipping out on the golf course
There are so many good movies with Adam Sandler, but not his romantic comedy movies
Yea, those arent as good.
Especially the newer ones
Hopefully he does some more straight comedy movies
What did you thik about Big Daddy?
I thought it was good, but overrated
There were a lot of good parts to it
I thought it was trying too hard to be a parent guide film
Adam was great in it though.
