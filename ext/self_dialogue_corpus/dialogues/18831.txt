What kind of music do you listen to?
I listen to all kinds of music!
Do you like progressive rock?
What's progressive rock?
Think keyboards, odd-time signatures, stuff not usually played on top 40 radio.
Oh.  Well, hmmm.  Not sure.  Can you provide any idea of what I might have heard before?
Sure!  Think Genesis before they got really popular.
Oh, so before Invisible Touch, right?
Yes - back when Phil Collins was just the drummer and not the singer.
I don't know if I've heard that type of stuff.
How about Rush?  Yes?
I know those!  Tom Sawyer, right? Owner Of A Lonely Heart?
Yes, now we're getting somewhere. Rush is a progressive band.  So is Yes.
But Owner Of A Lonely Heart and Tom sawyer - are they typical "Progressive" songs?
No and Yes  Owner isn't, Tom Sawyer is.
I don't follow.
Tom Sawyer has odd-time signatures (it's not four on the floor) and tons going on for being a 4 and a half minute song.
I agree, it's quite busy.
Yes, progressive rock can be - in a word - busy.
That's interesting!  I'll need to check some more progressive rock out!
