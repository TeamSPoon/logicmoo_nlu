What is your favorite comedy movie of all time?
Not sure -- either The Jerk or Meet the Parents.
The Jerk? I have never seen that.
You've got to be kidding me! It is seriously one of the funniest movies of all time. It stars Steve Martin and Bernadette Peters.
Oh, I love Steve Martin. What's it about?
Sort of a rags to riches story. A guy invents an eyeglass accessory.
I'll have to check it out. Have you see the movie Dick?
Good Dick?
No, Dick. It is a parody of Richard Nixon and Watergate.
Is it from the 70s?
No, I think the 90s. Kirsten Dunst is in it. She and another teenage girl accidentally get a job walking Nixon's dog.
Oh my god, that sounds great.
Yeah, they get to see all the behind the scenes activities in the White House. I won't tell you everything, though.
Historical comedy.
That reminds me of A Knight's Tale, although that wasn't really a comedy, but it had some funny stuff in it.
The one with Heath Ledger?
Yeah, and the Middle Ages people dancing to modern music.
Too bad about his death, I really enjoyed his work.
Yeah, me too. Oh, he was also in Ten Things I Hate About you, with Julia Stiles. Also funny.
Oh, that's a good romantic comedy.
