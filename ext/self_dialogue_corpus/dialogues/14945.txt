Hey, did you ever see Mrs. Doubtfire?
Oh, God. Yes, I loved that movie when I was a kid!
Me too! What was your favorite part?
Ahhh, geeze. It would have to be when Robin Williams fills the house with all those animals for his kids birthday party.
His wife was so mad.
Yeah, she was. What's your favorite scene?
When they're at the pool and Mrs. Doubtfire grabs a lime out of a fruit tray and pitches it like a baseball at the back of the boyfriends head.
Yes! And she goes, "It was a run by fruiting!"
Absolutely classic.
No doubt.
