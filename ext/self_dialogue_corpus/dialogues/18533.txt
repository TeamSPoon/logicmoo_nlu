Hey, have you ever heard of Johnny Cash?
I would be surprised if anyone hasn't he is a Legend.
He really is a music legend. Did you know he got a lifetime achievement award for his music?
Really? I did not know that. Who presented it to him?
It was a Grammy award from 1999.
Wow that is a huge honor.
What is your favorite song he played?
A boy named Sue was always a good one.
Oh that is good. What about Folsom Prison Blues?
Oh yeah that was used in a movie too wasn't it?
Yes it was in Shawshank Redemption.
That's the one. Haha I know he did not sing it but it was a great version of his song.
Yeah it was. I love how deep his songs are.
Yeah they really tell a story of his life. Did you know he was married to June Carter?
Yeah, that was his second wife. He was married to Vivian Leberto first.
Oh that's right he was. I think him and June were great together. They even sang together.
What is a song they played together?
"It Ain't Me Babe" is a good one.
I will have to check it out. I have not heard that one.
Yes. It is one of the first they did together. Check out "Jackson" too.
