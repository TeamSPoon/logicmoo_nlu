Do you like Frozen, Brave, or Tangled more?
I like Brave the best. So, does my wife.
Why do you like it more?
Because my family is Scottish.
Cool. Did you like the story?
Yes, the mom turning into a bear was really cool.
Yeah, I agree.
I wish they made a second one.
Me too. I heard they are making another Frozen movie.
Awesome. I can't wait to see what they do with it.
