Do you know Jeff Tweedy?
Im not sure.  Sounds familiar though.
He's the lead singer for Wilco.  Do you know them.
Again, heard of them but not that familiar.
You'd like them.
What are they like?
They're sort of folky alternative rock, but usually a harder edge than folk.
Do they have any big songs I would know?
Not really.  They aren't like that really.
Is there an album you'd recommend?
I like all of them but I think my favorite is Sky Blue Sky.
I'll get it and take a listen.
Impossible Germany, Hate it Here are two of my favorite songs on that album.
I'll see if I agree.
Oh, you will.  I just know its up your alley.
We'll see.
Well I'm confident enough that I bought the cd for you- here.
Dude, thanks!
Just give it a good listen and let me know what you think.
I will.  Thanks man,
