Ok, Coach, I'm sure you know what you're doing, but my son is missing a lot of shots
Yeah. I've noticed. he just has to get used to playing off wing.
Isn't it too early for him? He's only 10. He's barely getting used to his left wing position. Last year was the first time he started.
Nah. I started off wing when I was his age. Once he's used to it, he can switch easily between positions which is a skill the recruiters always looks for.
He's 10, I'm not worried about his college plans.
Well, I want to develop all my players to the best of my abilities.
I understand that when he comes home after practice, he's just...
Demoralized? Discouraged? Down?
Yeah. And I hate seeing him like that. I kinda want to put him back in the left where he can pass, receive without missing as much.
Listen. Of all the starters I have your kid does better as an off wing than anyone else. That's a great skill. It needs to developed and you should encourage him more.
And how do you supposed I do that coach?
Practice. Teach him how it's easier to protect the puck if you're lefty in right winger position, because you can just back hand it. And you still have a free hand
Um. That's your job, coach.
Hah, so, you're right. Then why are you complaining?
I just thought... I should do something, his mother was concerned, you know.
Understandable. Give me this season and him at the right winger position.
And if it doesn't work out?
Learn to stay posiitive. Your son has great skills as a right winger. He's just not as accurate
If it doesn't work out this season, or by the middle of the season, will you change him back?
If it turns out I'm wrong, then yes, I will change him back. No problem, but I'm right. Your kid has potential as an off wing
