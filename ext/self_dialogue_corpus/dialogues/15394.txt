Have you heard the new Katy Perry song?
Yeah, Swish Swish
Yeah, It isn't good, do you like it?
No, I think it is okay but I wouldn't buy it.
Yeah, me either and I am a little tired of the whole feul thing.
Yeah, me too.  Get over it already.
I agree, I don't know why you have to keep dragging it out.
Me either, it seems childish and petty.
I agree.
She has some good song but not sure how this album is going to be.
Yeah, if this first song is any indication, it is not sounding good.
I know.
Maybe she will have a better hit with the second song.
Maybe.
I wasn't real crazy about the song she did for the olympics but ended up using for Hilary.
I don't remeber it.
Exactly, it was pretty bland.
And clearly not very memorable.
I know.
Well, we will have to wait and see but not planning on buying any concert tickets just yet.
