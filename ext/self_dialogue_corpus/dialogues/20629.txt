So,what are you up to today?
Not much, just thinking about watching some movies.
That sounds fun, what are you going to watch?
I was thinking about a comedy.
I always enjoy watching a funny movie.
Have you watched anything recently that you would reccomend?
I watched Deadpool the other day.
I have been wanting to watch that one for a while now.
I really enjoyed it. Ryan Reynolds  was great in it.
I heard he is really funny in it.
He is, but it does have a lot of cussing it. Just in case you are going to watch with your little girl.
Thanks for the warning!
No problem! Have you seen Mom`S Night Out? It is funny and clean.
No, is it pretty good?
My family and I really enjoyed it!
Awesome, sounds like we will have to watch it !
Let me know what you think!
I will! Thanks for the suggestion .
No problem, I am glad to help.
If we like it I may call you back for another suggestion!
