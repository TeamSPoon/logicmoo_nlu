Are you ready for some football?
I am excited, it's less than a month away.
That's for the pre-season, almost two months before the actual season starts.
I like the pre-season just as much as the regular season.
I don't usually follow the games until the season starts.
I watch as much as I can, I wish the seasons were longer.
So who is going to make it to the Super Bowl this year?
I think it will be the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Dallas Cowboys.
That would be a great game, they both did real good last year.
I was hoping it would be those teams in last years Super Bowl, but it just didn't happen.
I would like to see that happen also, the Steelers are the team I would want to win.
I think it will happen, and the Cowboys will win the game.
I have been a Steelers fan ever since Terry Bradshaw played for them.
Terry Bradshaw was a great quarterback.
Some people think that he was the best quarterback of all time.
He was definitely one of the greatest, if not the greatest.
I wonder if he thinks that he was the greatest quarterback of all time.
I don't know, but I sure enjoy watching him co-hosting on Fox.
I like watching him too. He does like the Steelers.
He better like the Steeler, they are the team that made him famous.
