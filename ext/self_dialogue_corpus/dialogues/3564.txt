Did you ever watch the Scream movies?
I saw them back when they were in theaters.  The first one I saw in 1996.
The original was the best, I never figured out who the killers were until the end.
Me too, it never occured to me that there would be two killers.
The dialogue was so funny with Randy.
Yes, he had rules that one would have to abide by to successfully survive a horror film.
I feel sad that Tatum had to die.
I never was completely convinced that the garage door would have lifted her up though.
I do feel like that was the most unbelievable part of the movie.
Yes, garage doors probably have safety features with a weight limit.
