princess leia is a modern feminist icon
you're so right!
the only thing that makes her better is that she was played by a real woman
what do you mean?
carrie was real, authentic, messed up...and she was still famous! still an icon
i guess that is pretty inspirational for young, mentally ill women
you bet it is!
she was a great actress, too. i can't imagine anyone else pulling off the princess leia sass
that's because no one else could do it!
thanks, carrie
