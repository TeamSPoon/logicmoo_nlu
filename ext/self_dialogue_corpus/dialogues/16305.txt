Do you like alternative rock?
I like rock, but I'm not sure what counts as alternative.
Alternative would be bands like Red Hot Chili Peppers or Nirvana
Oh, I love Red Hot Chili Peppers. Then yeah, I would say I love alternative rock.
Whats your favorite song of theirs?
I like the song By the Way. It was the first song I heard
Thats a good song. Have you heard Snow?
It's a good song, but a little too slow for my taste.
If you like fast songs, I would recommend Dani California.
I've heard of the title but never heard the song. I'll check it out.
What about Nirvana?
I'm actually not a fan!
Why not?
I think Smells like Teen spirit is very overrated
I see. My favorite Alternative rock band is Green Day
Oh, I've heard of their songs.
I love a bit of punk in my rock. I love the song basket case
Cool, that song played at a friends wedding.
Have you heard any of their other stuff.
A little bit here and there, but I wouldn't call myself a fan
