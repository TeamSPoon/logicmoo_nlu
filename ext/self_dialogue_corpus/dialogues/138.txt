Do you think The Dark Knight is as good of a movie as people remember it?
Sort of. I loved it at the time and still love it but can't watch it that much.
Why not?
The score is too pulsating and overall it's just yelling and fighting. Gives me a headache in my old age.
I think that's it great, but people remember it as being better because of Heath.
You think that if he didn't die, it wouldn't be as well-regarded.
Sadly, yes.
That's kind of cruel.
It's true, though. It has this aura over it because it's the role the "killed" him.
Either way, far better than The Dark Knight Rises.
