Did you like The Phantom Menace?
Nah, it was pretty campy
I thought it was pretty good actually
What? Are you crazy?
No, I thought it had some really cool effects
I thought they looked pretty silly
Plus I liked learning about a young Darth Vader
Well his name was Anakin Skywalker at first
Yeah I know, but he did become Darth Vader eventually
Umm, yes I understand
