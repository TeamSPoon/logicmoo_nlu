Do you like action movies with a love story built in.
I think most action films have one.
Like what?
Well, all of them usually. Even Rambo.
Wow, I just noticed it does.
Yep. All the Rambo movies had lots of guns and a bit of love too.
I wonder why?
Maybe to keep the plot more than just non stop action.
I think the Matrix did that well.
Yep, mostly action, but a little love too.
