Have you been watching the Stanley Cup Playoffs?
Yeah! Have you?
Yeah, who are you cheering you?
I am cheering for Nashville, as they are really the underdog and have way outperformed their expectations.
Me too! I love PK Subban and think the team hasn't got the credit they deserve
They are a young team and have a lot of potential going into the future too
Very much agreed. It's hard not to pull for a Canadian team though too.
I agree - I always feel a little bad that the Canadians haven't won the Cup in a while.
You're right - I would love to see a Nashville Ottawa final
Who would you cheer for?
I think Nashville, but I wouldn't really care at that point. I don't want the Ducks or Penguins to get there
They've won too recently, it wouldn't be that interesting
I agree.
How about Erik Karlson's play?
He basically carried Ottawa in game 7, didn't he?
Yeah, and he's such a good guy! The team basically sat on his back for the entire game, didn't he have 3 points or something?
That sounds right. I'm also shocked that Crosby is still playing.
They should have pulled him out the other day in that game - when he went head first into the boards.
I'm going to be shocked if he makes it ten more years in the league, he has had a lot of concussions.
He might even be having the same CTE stuff that NFL players are all having issues with.
