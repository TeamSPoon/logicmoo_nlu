Do you think the Steelers will do well this year?
They have one of the best quarterbacks in Ben Roethlisberger.
How do you think their running game will do?
It is hard to say.  It mostly depends on how well Le'Veon Bell plays.
Yes he can be problematic.
Exactly.  He has had off field issues as well that seem to hold back his game.
What about the wide recievers?
Obviously Antonio Brown is argueably the best reciever in the league.
Do you think Martavis Bryant will contribute much?
I hope he does.  Before his suspension he contributed several touchdowns and stretched the field.
How do you think the defense will hold up?
They would improve a lot by just taking William Gay out of the game.
You don't think he plays well?
No. I think he is one of the worst coverage backs in the league.
What would you do if you were coaching?
I would play Artie Burns on one side at corner and try a rookie on the other side.
How about the linebacker spot?
James Harrison is back again, and even at his age he still plays well.
Do you think he can hold up all year?
Probably so, but hopefully he will get some help from J.J. Watts brother at linebacker.
