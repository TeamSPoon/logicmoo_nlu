Nice headphones. What are you listening to?
What!?
I said what are you listening to?
Oh. Sorry for shouting, I'm listening to Lord Huron.
No problem, I haven't heard of them. What are they like?
They're really good. It's folk rock, and the songs are epic.
Like Mumford and sons kind of?
I wouldn't say they're similar at all. This album especially.
What album?
It's their most recent release from 2015, called "Strange Trails".
Oh that's a cool name.
Yeah. It really describes the album well.
So it's like a concept album?
Not really. But it has a pretty cohesive feel to it.
Okay. So how would you describe the vibe?
That's what I'm saying, the title is pretty perfect. It make me feel like I'm adventuring on some trails.
Alright, then sign me up.
Dude, yeah give it a listen. I'll lend you my CD if you want borrow it.
That would be awesome.
You're gonna love it.
