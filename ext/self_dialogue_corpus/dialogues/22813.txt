What is your favorite kids movie?
That's a little broad, I'm not sure.
Think of something animated.
I think it varies. Trolls is a great movie though!
That movie is adorable! My kids love that.
The Burgens are pretty hideous.
They are. The Trolls are so cute though.
I loved the music in the movie.
Me too, even had Justin Timberlake in it.
Right! I knew that!
The movie over all had a great message, to stand up for others.
I liked how Bridget stood up for the Trolls at the end.
Yes that was very brave of her.
She was not thinking of herself, only others.
I know, very selfless of her.
I thought it was funny how the trolls gave her rainbow hair.
You mean when she turned into "Lady Glitter Sparkles"?
Yes that part!
That was so funny!
I've seen Trolls countless times this summer.
