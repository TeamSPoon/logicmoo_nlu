Do you consider The Sixth Sense to be a horror movie?
Yes, of course. Ghosts.
I looked it up and it's listed as Horror-Thriller.
Do you agree?
Well, ghosts don't make it horror, like Casper.
That's an extreme opposite, though, and shouldn't apply.
It's not scary is the issue. They see ghosts who have been bloodied, but it's not scary.
So what's it?
It's a kid who can see ghosts, and someone just coming to terms with that they're dead.
So, a psychological thriller?
