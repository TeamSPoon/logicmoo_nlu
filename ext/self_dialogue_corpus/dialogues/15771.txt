You know who I heard for the first time in a while this morning?
Who?
Kriss Kross. They played Jump and Warm It Up.
I remember Kriss Kross. Jermaine Dupri discovered those dudes in a shopping mall.
I know right. Shoot, remember when Jermaine Dupri made that song with Mariah Carey?
Which one?
Sweetheart.
Oh yeah. They play that one on the radio all the time down here.
I like Mariah Carey. I like the remix she did with Old Dirty Bastard.
You talking bout the Fantasy remix.
Yeah, that's the one. Old Dirty used to crack me up.
I know right. He was from the Wu-Tang Clan. wasn't it like a thousand of them dudes?
I know. I think it was like nine or ten. Method Man was the hottest though.
I like Blackout. The song Method Man did with Redman.
Redman was the truth. Remember he hooked up with Erik Semon and Keith Murray?
Yeah. They called themselvse the Def Squad. They did the Rapper's Delight remake.
That thing was fire. Keith Murray used to spit them metaphors.
I know. Only person like him was the bull Books from Das EFX.
Das Efx is on my playlist right now. I got their whole Straight From The Sewer album.
Is that the one with Microphone Checka on there?
