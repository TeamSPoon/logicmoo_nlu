I used to listen to a lot of rap, but nowadays I just can't get into it.
You're starting to sound like an old man.
I know and I hate it! There's nothing worse than people droning on about how much better it was in the old days. But ...
But you can't get into the newer stuff?
Right. There seems to have been a point when everyone got very serious. Too serious.
But there was serious stuff in the past, "The Message" by Grandmaster Flash came out in the early '80s for example.
I know, I mean that there was more of a mixture in the old days. Plus everyone these days is a solo artist, I miss the groups.
That's not true either, Migos for example are a trio and huge at the moment.
Okay maybe I'm being a bit hyperbolic but you get my point?
Maybe you should try and pinpoint when the change came for you, that might help you more.
Well I suppose my rap fandom came in two waves. Firstly the late '80s stuff like Public Enemy, Tribe Called Quest, NWA and so on.
All groups I notice. Go on.
Then in the '90s I was really into stuff like Pharcyde, Gang Starr, Diggin in the Crates, all that sort of stuff.
Still all groups. So what is the first thing you heard when you thought "This isn't for me"?
I suppose it was when everyone stopped sampling as much and started using digital keyboards instead. A lot of that West Coast Dr. Dre sound.
So you weren't a fan of Tupac then?
He was OK but I much preferred Biggie. Maybe I'm a East Coast hip hop snob!
It sounds like it! It made sense for the producers to play synths rather than pay for all those samples though.
I guess so, I remember reading that Lou Reed demanded 100% of the royalties from that Tribe song "Can I Kick It" that sampled him.
That was their big hit too, if I was them I'd have stopped sampling the day after that happened!
