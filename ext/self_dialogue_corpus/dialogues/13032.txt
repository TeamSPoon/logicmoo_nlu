Did you know the podracers engines are based off of real jet engines?
I didn't, is that what they actually look like?
Yes, if you look at a picture of a jet engine and compare it to anakins podracer they are exactly alike.
Another fun fact is the guy who played Darth Maul also appears without his evil makeup in another scene.
Which one? I'm not even sure I'd know what he looked like without the makeup.
He is one of the Naboo soldiers who is helping Padme get to her throne room in Theed.
Oh wow, that's cool!
The guy who played Darth Maul is named Ray Park, he is a professional stunt man and fight choreographer.
Does he still do sword fights?
He does, he still works in movies today sometimes and he even does his Darth Maul routine at Star Wars events for fans.
