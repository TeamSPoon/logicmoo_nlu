What is the last good movie you've seen?
I watched Sweet Home Alabama for the first time last night!
Oh, I love Reese Witherspoon!
Me too, she is the best.
Have you seen either of the Legally Blonde movies?
Of course! I love the original.
I like the sequel better actually. It is set in Washington, D.C.
I like the sequel as well. Wha other Reese movies do you like?
Walk the Line, of course. I think she won an award for it.
She did! She won the Oscar for Best Actress.
Well-deserved. What did you think of Sweet Home Alabama?
I thought it was pretty cute. What movies has she recently been in?
I'm not sure actually. My all time favorite Reese Witherspoon movie is Election.
Election is the best! It is pretty old, I think.
Yeah it is from 1999. Who else was in Election?
I think Matthew Broderick plays Jim McAllister.
Yes, he does. And Chris Klein plays Paul Metzler.
That's right. Did Election win any awards?
Witherspoon was nominated for a Golden Globe, but she didn't win.
That is too bad. It is a fantastic film.
