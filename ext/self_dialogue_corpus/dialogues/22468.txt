I saw Harold and Maude the other day.
Wow, that's an oldie!  I heard about it but never saw it.
Yes.  I saw the first five minutes in 1981 and never saw the rest until now.
Who's in it?
Ruth Gordon, the old lady in Rosemary's Baby.
She has the romance with the kid, right?
Yes.  It was quite comical and warm.
Wasn't there a lot of fake gore?
Yes, he pretends to commit suicide several times.
Black comedy I guess.
I can't believe they have sex.  Nothing graphic.
Wow, she's old in the movie no?
Yes, almost 80.
What happens in the end?
They have an eightieth birthday party.
Nice.
He proposes to her, but she tells him she took a pill to kill herself.
Wow, that's bad.
Yes, she dies in the end, but teaches him how to live.
Sounds like your classic cult movie.
