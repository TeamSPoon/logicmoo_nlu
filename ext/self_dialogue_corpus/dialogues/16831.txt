I love Fleetwood Mac, do you like them?
Yes, I just listened to their album Tusk.
That's good one, Sara is one of my favorite songs from that album.
Yes I like that song too, Stevie Nicks sounds great on that song.
Yes Stevie Nicks is a great song writer and singer, her voice is beautiful.
I love how she sounds on Landslide.
Have you listened to Fleetwood Mac's album Rumours?
Oh yes, that's one of their best albums.
I think Dreams is one of my favorite songs from the Romours album.
Yes that's a good one, but my favorite is Songbird.
Songbird is a beautiful song and Christine McVie does a great job with that song.
I think so too, what other songs do you like from that album?
I like The Chain and Gold Dust Woman.
Those are good ones, they have a bit of a harder edge to them.
Do you like their album Tango in the Night?
Yes I do, I can't remember what songs are on it that well though.
It has the songs Seven Wonders, Everywhere and Big Love on it.
Oh now I remember, those are good songs.
I think they last put out an album of original music in the early 2000's.
Yes the album was called Say You Will and it was fine, but not as good as their earlier stuff.
