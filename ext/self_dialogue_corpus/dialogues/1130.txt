Football!!!! Alright!  Almost time for football!!!
So you like football?
Heck, yeah!  Packers fan for life, dude!
How many will they win this year?
I'm thinkin at least 22 games.
Hmmmm, I think there's only 16 games in the season.
I'm countin playoffs.  Playoffs!!!!!
Ok, so I think that'd make 19 games if they win the Super Bowl.  Where's the extra 2?
You forgot the Wild Card game, dude?  Get your head out of your butt.
So, the Packers are going to go 16-0 and still play in the Wild Card game?  How's that work?
Politics, man, it's all about the politics.  It'll happen.  You just wait and see.
Ok, assuming that they play in the Wild Card game, that only makes 20 games.
You forgot the Pro Bowl.
So the NFC players in the Pro Bowl will all be from the Packers?  You sure about that?
Heck, yeah.  Nelson is going to have 27 TDs and 2,700 yards this year.  And Cobb will have 19 TDs and 1,500 yards.  He's not as good.
Wait a minute.  You're telling me that Rodgers is going to throw for 4,400 yards to just those two players?
Right. I forgot the other receivers.  Well, they'll combine for another 3,000 yards and another 19 TDs.
So now Rodgers is up to 7,400 yards and 65 TDs this year?  It seems that that's a little high.  Is he also going to throw passes to himself?
Why not?  He can do it all.  Football!!!!!!  Go Packers!!!!!  Go beer!!!!!  Go shirtless fat guys!!!!!
You scare me.
