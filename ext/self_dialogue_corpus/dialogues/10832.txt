Do you remember seeing the latest fast and the furious movie?
I do, remember I went with you and my dad?
Yeah I do.  What was your favorite part in it?
It was when Vin Diesel turns bad and joins the enemy.
What is that part your favorite?
It's my favorite because I love Vin plus I never saw the turn coming.
Me either. I am glad they are making more of the movies to hopefully explain his actions.
Me to.  The way they drive the cars around with the stunts makes it a great movie to see.
I agree.  I love the black muscle car the Vin's character drives around.
I love the green honda.  It is little but packs a punch.
