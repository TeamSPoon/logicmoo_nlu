Of the classic Disney princesses, who is your favorite?
By classic you mean, maybe Belle, Aurora, Cinderella, Mulan etc.
For the most part yes.
Okay, well in that case, I think I always fancied Mulan.
Why her?
Well, I can relate to her because she is Chinese and I was born in China.
Cool, cool.
Also, she is brave and was willing to sacrifice life and limb for her country.
She was pretty honorable and clever.
Especially in the final scenes when she used what she learned in the military training to plant the fireworks in the building and blow the villain away.
