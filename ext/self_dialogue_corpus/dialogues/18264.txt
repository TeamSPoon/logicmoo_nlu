What do you think about Kanye's The Life of Pablo album?
Meh, don't really car for it.
He's really changed his style.
Yeah, kind of like Drake and his new album.
Nah, I love Drake's new album.
Really? Like what song?
Gyalchester is amazing.
I don't think I listened to that one.
It's probably the best from that album.
Maybe I'll take a listen again.
Anything else catch your ear?
Yeah, I've been listening to GWAR.
Who the hell is that?
They made a great rendition of Carry On My Wayward Son.
You mean the Kansas song?
Yeah! The one from Old School, Will Ferrell sings it.
Is it a straight cover or some hard core crazy stuff?
I felt like my ears were going to fall off, but in a good way.
Wow. That sounds intense.
Yeah, you should give them a try.
