So who do you think will be on the Met Gala worst dressed list
I am definitely putting my vote in for Solange and her dress coat
The designer of her dress was Calvin Klein
I think the dress is a miss this year.
Although I somewhat admire her fashion bravery
She does take a stand, especially with this black Patent leather dress.
I also have to say that Jennifer Lopez' dress did not live up to expectation
I kind of agree but the color of the Oscar De Larenta dress was beautiful
I just thought the cut of the dress was unflattering
I like the fullness of it and how it fluttered in the wind
It was refreshing to see her go in opposite direction of what she typical wears
I loved the Moroccan inspired vibe it gave.
With her hair in that high pony tail and the dress it seemed like she was a genie.
Her jewelry was just right.
On the other hand I really loved Zendayas Marchesa gown.
The floral pattern was gorgeous.
Especially against the red bright red silk background
The background really made the dress pop
The fullness of the dress, without any slits was so chic.
She really has a chic, edgy way with fashion
