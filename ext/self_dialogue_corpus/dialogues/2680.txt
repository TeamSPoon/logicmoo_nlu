Oh my God, I am getting so excited about the Saints season.
Me too. But I'm looking at everything with cautious optimism.
I totally get it. I am too. When you finished 7-9 the past three seasons, you can't overly excited.
Unfortunately, I do tend to get overly excited, and it seems to always lead to disappointment
I think we were spoiled when we won the Super Bowl.
Yeah, we got used to winning. And we expected it to be that way every year from that point on.
We did have a couple of good seasons after that but then things started going south.
Well, we did have a lot of injuries.
True. But all teams have injuries. I'm sure the Patriots have injuries every year, but they seem to have people that can step right in and play.
I'm really excited to see Adrian Peterson in action.
Me too. I think he and Mark Ingram make a great pair. I just hope they can both stay healthy.
And let's not forget Drew Brees. I honestly have so much confidence in him. He's getting older, sure, but I still think he has a few years before he calls it quits.
This will be an interesting year for both he and Sean Payton. If we have another losing season, Payton's gone.
What about Brees? Won't he be a free agent?
I think so. I would not be surprised if we draft a quarterback in the 2018 draft, and not just a back-up.
Drew's heir apparent?
Yeah, and the day Drew is no longer with the Saints is the day is go into a very deep depression.
I think this whole city will go into a deep depression.
Well, we can't think about that now. We have to think about the upcoming season. And that first game against the Vikings. Oh my God, we have got to win that first game.
I know. And can you imagine the hype, with AP returning to Minnesota. Plus it's Monday Night Football. I can't wait.
