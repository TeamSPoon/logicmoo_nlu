I have been trying to get more into classic films, know much about them?
A bit, I like to watch them.
Which would you say I should start with?
I would go Casablanca, for sure. That is a real classic.
I do not really know that one, who is in it.
Humphrey Bogart, I am sure you would know him if you seen him.
Which others, after that.
Well, there are lots. I would start on some Audrey Hepburn movies.
The girl from that Tiffany's movie?
Breakfast at Tiffany's. Yes, and get into that one too. It is great. She has others.
Like what?
There is one called Roman Holiday.
What is it about.
I will not spoil it, but she is a princess it also has Gregory Peck, real old film leading guy.
I liked a few of his films. Know any that are a bit less romance?
Alfred Hitchcock does a lot of horror, little romance too, but some good scary stuff.
Like what?
Well, there is Psycho.
The black and white one.
Yes, but it was so gory at the time it had to be black and white. It is a really classic, but interesting film.
