The new Harry Potter film is amazing!
Which one? I thought they were finished making those.
The original Harry Potter, yes. But there are new films out!
What are they about?
Well, this one is about real-life students who attend magic school.
A bit cliche, don't you think?
Maybe, but it was a huge success at the box office.
Will they make more?
Maybe! I would reccomend you go see that one.
I do like Harry Potter films. I'll give it a shot.
