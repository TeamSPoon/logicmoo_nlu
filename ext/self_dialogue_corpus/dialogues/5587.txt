What was your favorite Disney movie as a child?
The Fox and the Hound. Have you seen it?
No, I'm not familiar with that one. What's it about?
Well, it's a story of friendship between a fox and hound, but it has a very sad aspect to it.
How so? What is sad about it?
The fox and the hound become friends when they are young, but when the hound grows up they are split apart.
Oh, that sounds fairly typical of Disney movies from that time period.
Yes, that is true. Lion King, Bambi, and all of the other movies at that time had some sad parts in the plots.
I can't count how many times I watched Lion King, but I always looked away during the scene where Mufasa died.
I can understand that. Tough for a kid to watch.
