Did you see the latest Fast and The Furious movie
I did, I thought it was entertaining.  However I am not a big fan of the movies.
Really, I love them.  How can you not be a fan of the actors in those movies?
I love the actors in the movie.  I love The Rock, Jason Stathem, etc?
Then what don't you like about the movies?
I am not a big car guy.  The action is cool, but fake as hell and the stories are ridiculous
I thought the Fate of the Furious was great.
I kind of lost all respect for the movies when in either the last one or the one before that they had Vin Deasel's character jump across a bridge from one car to the other.  It was fucking stupid as hell.
I remember that scene.  It was pretty cheesy.
Like I said, I like them because they are entertaining.  However, I am not going to the movie theater to see them, I'm waiting for DVD.
Who are your favorite Characters in the movie?
I am a huge fan of the Rock, so I would have to say his.
I love Jason Stathem's character.  He is an awesome marital artist.
He can kick some ass.
What are your favorite type movies.
I am a big super hero guy?  I love the Avengers
I am too.  They are really good.
Much better than the Fast and the Furious
I can't wait for Avengers 3
That is going to be the best of them all.
