What is your favoriate Beatles album?
Definately Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.  So influential and unique.  How about you?
I'm a big fan of the White Album.  I think the band really got into their artistic side in that one.
Well I can't argue with that.  The White Album is iconic.  What's your favorite overall Beatle song?
I'd have to say it is Hard Days Night.  It's so upbeat and kinda funny.  How about you?
A day in the life.  Again, Sgt. Pepper's is my favorite album and this song is near perfect to me.
Not a bad choice.  Did you ever watch any Beatle movies? Like Yellow Submarine or Hard Days Night?
I actually can't stand Yellow Submarine.  You do know that the voice parts are not the actual band members right?
Well yeah, but you've got to love that crazy 70's animation though.
Actually, the drawings kinda creep me out.
