Let's talk about pop music, what is your favorite current hit?
I am liking anything by Bebe Rexha right now.
Oh yeah, i like her too.
I feel pop music is more diversified now than it used to be.
What do you mean by that?
I mean there are so many artists and styles that it is hard to keep up with all of them.
Yeah I see what you mean, it used to be you would hear the same old song over and over again on the radio.
Do you ever go to concerts?
Yes there is an event in my town every year called Firefly where bands play all weekend.
That sounds fun, I would love to go to something like that.
