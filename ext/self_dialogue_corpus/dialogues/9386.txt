Ain't nothin' but a G thang baby.........
What are you doing? You quoting Dr. Dre?
Actually, I am quoting Snoop Dogg or Snoop Lion or whatever he calls himself today.
Why'd he change his name anyway? Snoop Dogg sounds so much better than Snoop Lion.
Beats me. All I know is The Chronic album was the bomb.
You darn right. It was definitely my favorite rap album back in the day.
And the videos were so raunchy. I don't think MTV would play them anymore.
Does MTV still play music videos? I honestly do not know.
Was the dude that played Eazy E in the Snoop and Dre videos the same little dude that was in Ice Cube's Friday movie?
That's a really good question. I don't know but they do look just alike.
