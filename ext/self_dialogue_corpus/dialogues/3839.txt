Yes, it has an all start cast!
Yes, I have seen it. It has been a few years though.
What do you remember about it?
I just remember Leonardo and Matt Damon giving amazing perfomrances.
Yes, they acted their hearts out.
I was amazed when i first watched it how well the plot and character development was.
You don't see that too much in the gangster movie genre.
I think it is better than Godfather 1.
