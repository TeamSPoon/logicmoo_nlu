Hey! What did you think about the Bruins game last night?
Without Rask and Marchand they're falling apart!
Games like that make me reminisce about the '71 Bruins.
Forget the '71 team! All we need is Bobby Orr.
Even at 70 years old Bobby Orr could lead this season's team to victory.
Yeah, too bad we don't have better talent.
Well they fire Coach Julien so whoever they get to replace him has got to be better.
No doubt. He'll bring in some real talent that isn't afraid to get rough.
They don't even need roughness. This team just needs more drive and passion.
I agree! If they really put an effort into it we'd be all set.
Maybe next season will be better.
We can only hope. I've been catching some minor league games recently and there is definitely talent out there.
The farm team for the Bruins is stacked.
I sure hope the new coach calls up some players from the minors.
I think he will.
That will even open up space on the minors for some of these new college grads who look promising.
I was a UNH game last week and there were a couple guys out on the ice who made some great shots.
I heard about that game! The overtime slapshot was incredible.
Yeah! I've got to get back to work, but I'll catch you at the Bruins game next week!
See you there!
