So you work as a children's librarian, right?
That's right.
What movies are popular at the library right now?
Well, recent releases are always popular. Beauty & the Best is very popular right now.
I can imagine!
And people keep asking about the Captain Underpants movie, which isn't even in theaters yet.
Ha, that's funny.
I know! Trolls is also really popular.
Really? I've never seen that.
Me either.
Any trends that surprised you?
I was really surprised by how into terrifying movies some of the kids are.
By terrifying do you mean Goosebumps?
Well, they might settle for Goosebumps if they can't check out adult movies, but I've had 9-year-olds who want to check out The Exorcist and Rings.
Really? Those movies are too scary for me, and I'm an adult!
Same here!
Wow, that is funny.
Yeah, some of those kids are super good with horror movies.
Huh, I expected more popularity for Dora or My Little Pony.
Oh, don't worry, those are popular too - just not with the same people!
