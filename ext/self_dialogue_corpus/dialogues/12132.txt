what is your favorite Star Wars movie?
To me the original Star Wars was the best. You?
I loved Return of the jedi. So many of the films are great though.
Is that the one with ewoks?
Yes it is . They are so cute. I love all the scenes with them featured.
They are cute. I feel no other star wars movie has that aspect in them.
Well I think they tried to do another cute funny character with Jar Jar Binks but that flopped.
Ya what a failure on that character. He was so annoying. What were they thinking?
George Lucas probably wanted some kind of comic relief just not well realized.
Certainly wasn't. I do enjoy the majority of the other Star Wars characters.
