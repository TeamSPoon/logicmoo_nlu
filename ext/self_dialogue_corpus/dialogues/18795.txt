Ah, nothing like unwinding to some sweet sweet tunes.
These are what you call sweet tunes? I feel like robots are trying to get into my head!
Oh come now, its just dubstep. All the kids are into it.
I think you're too old for this racket.
Hey, its a legitimate genre!
Its legitimately trash.
Ok mister high and mighty, what do YOU listen to?
I'm a blues man myself.
Tortured soul?
Yeah, I am deep down sad all the time, and the music just gets me.
Thats dark. I bet I could find some blues dubstep covers.
Please don't.
Oh I'm so doing this.
I will tear off my ears before I listen to dubstep blues remixes.
Ok, ok, fine. No need to be so dramatic.
Thanks, I don't think I could take it.
What about techno, can we at least agree EDM is pretty great?
Yeah, sometimes. Its usually at least danceable.
Now we can see eye to eye!
More like ear to ear.
