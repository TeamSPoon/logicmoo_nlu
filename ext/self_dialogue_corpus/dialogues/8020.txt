I am so surprised Madonna is still putting out albums?
Really, she's the Queen of Pop though, what else is she supposed to do.
Retire.
She's not gonan retire, she just put out an album in 2015.
Yeah, Rebel heart was a pretty good album, best one she's put out in a while.
Well nothign can beat what she was doing in the 80s, Like a Virgin is still amazing.
And thats exactly my point, her best stuff is the music she did was like 25 years ago.
No way, has been pushing the pop industry well through the 90s and 2000s
Ray of Light and American Life are ok I guess.
They're more then ok, they're awesome.  She's the queen of pop, hands down.
