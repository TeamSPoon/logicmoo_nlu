I have a bunch of old Ska cassettes if you know anybody who'd be interested in buying them.
Oh man, I would be if I had a tape player.
If mine still worked I'd throw it in. But I have a bunch of Operation Ivy, The Specials, Flight One Eighty and such just if you're interested.
Those are good bands.
Yeah, but I haven't had any luck asking friends.
I mean it's not the most popular genre...
No, and I don't really know the right outlet for selling or trading specifically ska music.
Have you tried looking for social media groups?
Yeah, there isn't really anything local since it's such a small town though.
You know there's a subreddit for everything on Reddit, and I happen to know there's a ska subreddit cause I'm subscribed to it.
Is it very active?
Relatively. There's no one there who isn't familar with those groups and even if you don't manage to sell them you'll meet new people with the same interest in ska!
I just may have to do that. I need more rudeboys and girls in my life.
I mean that's the biggest venue for us I can think of, short of actually going to ska shows.
Which won't be around here, unfortunately.
True that. Hey maybe you could gift them to someone who'd be willing to listen to them and who hasn't been exposed to ska.
That would be a great way to spread the love for it.
Yeah! I feel like it really deserves a bigger fanbase.
It seemed like when I was growing up there was a bigger fanbase for it, but in hindsight I think that was just my family.
Same here.
