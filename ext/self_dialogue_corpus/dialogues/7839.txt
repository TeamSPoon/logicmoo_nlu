What's your favorite movie?
I would probably go with the last one.
You're talking Deathly Hallows Part 2, right?
Yeah.  Part 1 was super boring.
It wasn't that bad, it was trying to build up the action.
Yeah, but how many times can you camp in the wilderness?
The whole point was to show that no place is safe.
But did we really need two hours of that?
Again, it was a slow burn.  I realize it's not for everyone.
I don't think it's for anyone.  Part 2 forever!
