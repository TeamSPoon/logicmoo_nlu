Have you seen any Disney movies recently?
Yes I saw Enchanted.
Oh my gosh I love that movie!
I love Amy Adams and James Marsden in it.
They make a cute couple in the movie.
I love princess movies, they are cute.
I wish they would do a sequel to that.
Oh me too. But maybe one day they will.
Let us hope.
Nice talking to you!
