Did you ever listen to Nirvana and Pearl Jam when we were younger?
Yeah, I loved that Grunge rock stuff.  It was my favorite in the nineties.
Mine, too!  I even learned to play the guitar so I could play along.
I remember the night Kurt Cobain died.  I was watching MTv and they had nonstop coverage.
Yeah, that was really tragic.  Pearl Jam had great music, though.
I wonder what happened to them.
I don't know.  All those bands seemed to kinda disappear.
I loved the Smashing Pumpkins, too.  A lot of people thought they were weird but I liked them.
Wasn't the singer Billy Corbin or something like that?
I don't know, I just listened to their music.  But it had a unique, electronic sound.
I thought it was strange.  I do remember that one song "Today" that was a little catchy.
Yeah, that was one of their bigger hits but their lesser known songs were great.
I never bought any of their albums.
You were missing out.  What about Soundgarden?
I used to like them, too.  And Candlebox!
Yeah, I had their album but they were more of a one hit wonder.
Yeah, you could call them that.  Did you ever listen to Rage Against the Machine?
I wouldn't really call them grunge.
No, but they were from the same era.
Yeah, I didn't like their sound.  It didn't have a beat.
