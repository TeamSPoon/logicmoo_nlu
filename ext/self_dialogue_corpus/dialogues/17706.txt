Did you know Doris Day came out with an album a few years ago.
No, get out of here! Isn't she like a hundred.
No, she is in her 90's now, but she recorded an album at 87 years old called My Heart.
Get out here, my dad use to listen to her all the time.
She is covering beach boy tunes and 9 new songs, written by her late son.
I remeber my father plaaying her records when i was a child. That voice was angelic.
I wasn’t quite sure what to expect with the new album.
I knew she hadn't worked in show business for a while.
Yeah she had been looking after her animals.
she always seemed so perky.
I feel that spirit in the album.
it’s probably very beautifully sung.
On the album, she included Ohio from the musical Wonderful Town.
It had sentimental value because she grew up there.
How do you know these things too?
My Dad loved Doris Day.
When she is singing there’s a lot of emotion in your voice.
Yes I know.
I am going go listen to The Heart.
I am going to catch a tune or two on youtube.
