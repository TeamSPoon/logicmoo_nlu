Hi. Did you hear Jay Z is releasing another album?
Yes, I did. He's an incredible artist.
Tidal users get dibs on it of course. He's a smart businessman.
Of course he is. He's a Sagittarius, like myself.
Funny! What does that mean? What does him being a Sag makes a difference?
Well, we're all smart and hilarious. We see future trends and some of us know how to capitalize on it.
I'm assuming you're not one of those who received the capitalize on it gene.
My time isn't now. It's Jay Z's time. That album is going to be sick.
It's supposed to be a visual album. like his wife's "Lemonade".
"Lemonade" was an incredible creation. I wonder if they compete with each other.
Now he's a father of three. I wonder how that will make his music different.
Well "Kill Jay Z" might be a clue. Why would Jay be hungry now.
His craft still needs to be expressed. He's still an artist.
He makes a good omelet, does that make him a chef?
That's crazy. He's the Chef, the Restauranteur, and Critic.
I know his skill isn't a fluke. He's a mastermind.
His talent is remarkable. And then he's able to use his art to transcend cultures.
Wow. You got that in a nutshell. I always look forward to what he has to offer.
Well he's the Basquiat of Rap culture. He knows no bounds.
You should write for his magazine. You've got a way with words.
