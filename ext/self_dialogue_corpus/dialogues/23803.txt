What are some must watch comedy movies for adults?
I think Office Space is one.
Why do you think that?
It shows the weird feeling of being an adult on the outside, but not so much on the inside.
I think the movie Knocked Up was like that.
Yep, Seth Rogan was who we all are on the inside.
What other ones do you think are must watch?
Galaxy Quest for sure.
The one with Tim Allen.
Yes, it is kind of a spoof.
It is like a parody of Star Trek right?
Kind of, more of Trekkie fans.
I remember Alan Rickman in that one right?
Yes, his character reminded me of the time he was in the other one about outer space.
Hitch Hikers guide to the Galaxy?
Yes! Where he play the robot.
That show was so funny and so clever.
I loved the way they answered the question of what is the meaning of the universe.
It was forty two.
That film was funny but also left you really thinking.
