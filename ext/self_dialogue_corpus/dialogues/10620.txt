So what's your favorite Fast & Furious movie?
I have to give that to Furious 7.
Same here. What's your reason?
For me, it holds a special place in my heart because it was the sendoff film for Brian.
Was he your favorite character?
Yes, ever since the first one.
It was a really touching sendoff to see him go off and be a father.
Yeah. I'm tearing up just thinking about it.
Man, you're gonna make me cry by saying that!
I'm not crying, you're crying!
