I can't remember the last time I have seen a good comedy film.
I know.  I think the newer comedy films haven't been anything special.
In the 90s, you had tons of good comedy films like The Nutty Professor or Ace Ventura.
Eddie Murphy was a comic genius around that time.  So was Jim Carrey.
I think as these stars get older, they become less interested in having a big hit film.
I think Eddie Murphy could make another hit movie if he really wanted to.
He could.  I would love to see a Golden Child sequel.
That movie was before my time, but I saw it on television the other day.  I love the storyline.
It was a fun movie that mixed comedy and action with the supernatural.  A bit similar to "Big Trouble in Little China" with Kurt Russell.
Those movies are very similar!   I think Golden Child was a funnier film.
