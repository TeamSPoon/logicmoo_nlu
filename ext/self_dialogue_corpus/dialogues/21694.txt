Remember how wild the horror movies of the 1980's were?
Yeah, best place to watch them were in the theaters. Most of them were campy, but a lot better then horror movies they have these days.
Which one horror movie of that time was your favorite?
I was big into vampires so I would have to say Lost Boys. i was practically in love with Keifer Sutherland.
Oh, that's one of the best vampire flicks I've seen to this day. And a bonus is it was filmed in the town where I grew up.
You lived in Santa Cruz? Did you see them actually film the movie there?
No, I wish. There was a big hubub though when they were filming, lots of areas in Santa Cruz were closed off to the public. I would have loved to grab a peak at Jason Patrick. He was a hunk and a half.
Yeah, he was hot. The character he portrayed was amazing, he oozed attraction. But never as good a vampire as Keifer.
I agree with you. The movie had a good story and actually gave me a couple jump scares.
Oh, and I loved the fact that Lost Boys also casted the two Coreys. Corey Haim and Corey Feldmen.
I remember them, they were a pretty popular duo in the 1980's.
I had posters of them plastered all over my bedroom walls.
You and hundreds of other teenagers. I was not really into their characters in the movie itself. They were trying to hunt the vampires after all.
Cheers for the vampires. If only they could make great movies like that one these days. I honestly have not seen a decent vampire movie since Lost Boys.
To be honest, I would agree that one has never been made. Look what you have to compare Lost Boys to and it's a no-brainer.
Amen to that.
Thinking of the movie makes me yearn to visit Santa Cruz once again and walk the old Santa Cruz boardwalk. It's so nostalgic.
Me too. Maybe we should hang out this weekend and rent the movie to watch.
Let's do that! We can hang out at my place.
Awesome. Can't wait to see some hot vampire action. I'll bring the popcorn.
