Did you see that a new lion king is coming out?
Yes but it wont be until next year
I know its just crazy a new one is coming
i dont think kids today will remember the orginal one
maybe but it wouldnt be hard for them to watch it to get up to date
good point, you can see anything nowadays especially with the internet
exactly, i wonder if it will follow with simbas life
hopefully, and i would like to see timbon and pumba also
i loved those guys, their song was awesome
i loved their song too, it was so catchy
