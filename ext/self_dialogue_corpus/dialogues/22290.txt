Do you like to watch musicals?
The Sound of Music is great but most of them bug me.
I like Carousel too.
I enjoy the songs but not the story of that one.
How about Grease?
Ug. I hate it.
Ha, me too.
I don't know why anyone is so enamored of Grease.
I have no clue. It's annoying.
I like Olivia Newton John, though.
So do I. I like her music, non Grease at least.
She has some sort of country sounding stuff and I like that.
Me too. Is she in other movies besides Grease?
I think she had another musical.
I wonder if that's better.
I think it was about skating.
Sounds weird.
It does actually. I haven't seen it.
I'd give it a shot.
We can find it online I bet.
