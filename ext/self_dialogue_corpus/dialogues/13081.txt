Have you seen the original Star Wars movie?
I don't think I have.
It is really good -we should watch it.
Who is in it?
Harrison Frord plats Han Solo and Carroe Fisher plays Princess Leia.
Didn't Carrie Fisher die recently?
Yeah her and her mom both passed away.
That's rough.
Yeah but she was good in the movie.
Alright let's watch it.
