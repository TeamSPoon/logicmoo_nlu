Which of the Die Hard movies is your favorite?
I'm going to go ahead and actually pick a somewhat recent one.
Please, not the one in Russia.
Oh, of course not. That was ridiculous.
Yeah, A Good Day to Die Hard was insanely awful.
Live Free or Die Hard, with Justin Long
That was pretty good, yeah.
Which was the one with the racist sign that he had to wear?
I think that was Die Hard 2. Timely with the riots.
That was kind of stupid and disturbing but we got to meet Samuel L Jackson!
