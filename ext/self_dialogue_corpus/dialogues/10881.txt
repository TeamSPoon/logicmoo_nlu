I've always felt that the Fast & Furious films have had great settings.
I can agree with that. The settings always add so much more to the movie overall.
Absolutely. Do you have a favorite?
Yes. For me, it's Tokyo Drift.
I wanted to say that too! I thought seeing them race through the streets of Japan looked absolutely gorgeous.
You took the words from my mouth there. It was a great experience.
Do you have a second place for setting?
Well, because I absolutely love Dubai, I'm going to say Furious 7.
But that movie wasn't only in Dubai.
That's true, but the time that they were in Dubai was great, I thought.
