Did you like the superbowl halftime show this past year?
It was okay. I am not a Lady GaGa fan.
She kept it tasteful though.
She did. I will give her that.
Did you even watch the game? I didn't.
I did watch it. I love my Falcons.
Oh, so the ending stinks for you.
Yeah, but it's OK. My husband was upset for weeks though.
That is just crazy.
No, he is just passionate about the game.
Yeah, my man likes football too, but I won't let him act crazy about it.
Well, he didn't act crazy. He was just upset.
Why is it a big deal?
If you are really a fan then you devote a lot of yourself to the team. You want to see them do well.
I get that, but it is just a game.
It is a game, but not just a game.
I don't understand.
That would be like tell you that you MK purse is just a bag.
Oh, now you are talking crazy;.
I am just trying to help you understand.
