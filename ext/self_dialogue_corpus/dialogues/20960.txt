Did you want to see the Baywatch remake movie?
I am honestly not interested in seeing bouncing boobs.
Do you want to see Spider Man Homecoming?
My 8 year daughter Jenna wants to see it. She is asking to see it for her birthday. I do not know why.
How about the high humidity movie with Nicole Kidman?
That sounds like the only movie I want to see. I am a reformed man hating single mom. However, it would be fun for one day.
Do you want to see the Tupac remake all eyes on me?
No way. I love Tupac so much and it will make me sad he is gone.
