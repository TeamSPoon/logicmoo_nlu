Did you hear Rick Springfield's latest album yet?
No, I haven't.  What's it called?
It's called "Rocket Science"  It's really cool!
I'll have to check that one out!  Remember when we saw him in concert last year?
Yeah. he is great to see live in concert.
If you had a choice of any singers or bands, living or dead that you could see in concert, who would you pick?
Top 5?
Yeah, top 5.
Okay, here goes: Elvis Presely, The Doors, Eddie Cochran, Def Leppard and Frank Sinatra
That's a pretty cool list!  Elvis would make my list too.
Tell me yours.
Okay, here is mine: Elvis, The Dixie Chicks, The Beatles, The Beach Boys and Led Zeppelin
Cool list!  I should have picked The Beatles!  I saw the Dixie Chicks once.  They were amazing!
What's your favorite Dixie Chicks song?
That would be "Long Time Gone".  Love that song.
Me too.  Mine would be "Truth No. 2"  Great song.
Let me know when you get that new Springfield album.
Yeah, I definitely will!
Remember singing "Jessie's Girl" when we were in high school?
Yeah, man.  I remember!  That was awesome!
