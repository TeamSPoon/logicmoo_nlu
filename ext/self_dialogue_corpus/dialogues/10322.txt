Hey Tony, let's go to a movie tonight!
Ok. What are you up for?
An action movie!
I do't know. There are so few good ones made anymore.
What are you talking about? There are tons of good action movies!
There are tons of action movies, but few have really god character development or interesting plot.
What abut the Transformers? That was a good series!
The first one was pretty good, but then Hollywood decided to make all those sequels...
What's wrong with sequels?
They are like new wives: A figment of self-delusion. You fool yourself to think that the next one will be better than the one you were able to get while you were in your prime!
