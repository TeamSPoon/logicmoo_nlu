Which one?
The Eagles vs. the Bears.
Sounds great.
I can't wait to tailgate.
Wow, I'd love to do that.
What do you like to eat?
I like burgers and potatoes.
You can find that at a football tailgate!
Sounds great.
Who do think will win tonight?
I think that the Eagles are going to win this time.
It was a tough battle last time they were matched up.
You bet.
I hope the Eagles win.
They sure have some great players.
Yes, I love Ryan and Jordan Matthews.
Ertz is fun to watch as well.
Let's pack and get going.
This should be exciting.
