I absolutely hate the Cannibal Corpse.
Well, it's not for everyone. Especially girls.
I mean even for dudes, why would any dude want to listen to that unless you have issues?
I've listened to some, I don't have issues.
Yes,but you listen to them as a study.
So what? I still listened and actually enjoyed a few songs.
Oh, my God. i can't believe you just said that.
What? Some of their songs really highlight their talent.
Screaming and playing cacophony isn't a talent.
Well, playing cacophony to that extent does require some skills at their instruments.
And what about the message in their lyric, it' just disgusting.
You know, people said the same thing about the composers from the Romantic era.
Like who?
A bunch of them. Liszt, Paganini, and others. They all had references to the devil, and fire and things which we no longer find offensive, but back i those days, it was a big deal.
Fire is pretty tame. Devil, maybe. A bit offensive.
Well, fire as in burning in hell fire. But Liszt did write many pieces with certain macabre references like the Totentanz, the dance of the dead., or the Mephisto waltz, named after the demon in German Folklore.
That was the end of the age of Enlightenment, so I can see something like that becoming more common.
Well, there were still a significant Christian reaction to them at the time.
Christians react to all things they consider offensive. Even other Christians.
True. But to say the least, we shouldn't just dismiss musicians for what they portray on stage. We should evaluate them at their face value as musicians. And as musicians, the Cannibal Corpse is a talented group.
