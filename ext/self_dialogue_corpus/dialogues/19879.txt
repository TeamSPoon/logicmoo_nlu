Do you like AC/DC?
I sure do.
They have so many great songs, and such a distinctive style.
The only problem I have is a vast majority of their songs are only about sex.
It would be nice to see a little variety.
They only perform a certain type of song, but they do it better than just about anyone else out there.
What's your favorite?
I always liked Back in Black. It's such an energetic song.
My favorite is Highway to Hell.
That's kind of the opposite. It's very slow and deliberate pacing.
I also like Thunderstruck.
Just don't try and sing these songs at karaoke. You'll blow out your voice in no time.
Yeah, you definitely have to do a bit of a hybrid rather than a full on impression.
Overall, do you prefer Bon Scott or Bryan Johnson?
Overall, I think Bon Scott. Although they sound almost exactly alike.
They got their start in the 70s. Are they still touring?
I have no idea. They seem like they're rockers for life.
I don't think they'll ever completely retire.
For those about to rock, we salute them.
Indeed.
