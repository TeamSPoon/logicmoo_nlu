What's the best Disney movie ever made?
I think Moana is the best one ever
That's really recent though
What's wrong with that?
We'll have to see if it becomes a classic or if it goes away slowly
I really like how cool it is and how catchy the songs are
I think they paid a lot of famous celebs to appear in it and to make it popular
Well that's your opinion, What's your favorite then?
I like the original Cinderella, she's the reason the Disney castle is famous!
True, I too like the classic Disney princesses with dresses and castles
