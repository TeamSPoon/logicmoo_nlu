Did you like Interstellar
Yes
What did you think about the characters?
They were funny and did a great job
Matthew McConaughey had a believable performance
He was too good of a pilot
When he guided the ship to the space station with it spinning out of control, that was a bit unrealistic
It was a dumb mistake on Matt Damon's character
Yeah, there should have been someone in charge
Anne Hathaway was scary at the start
She was scary when you didn't know that it was NASA
It's no wonder they were keeping their operation secret with how the schools felt about them
I wonder if the teacher was misinformed or if she was trying to hide the truth
You were led to believe that she was misinformed
Compared to what the reality was, she was way off. They were doing big things
I didn't understand the urgency to find somewhere earthlike so quickly
There plenty of technology that didn't seem to fit with the timeline.
I'm not sure how the space station got over the planet in the other system
The inside of the black hole was really fiction
On the up side, it does illustrate what one might look like
