Who is this band?
The Beatles!  This is one of their first songs.
Oh, how did I not recognize that?
Because the song isn't played that much.  This is "Please Please Me," one of their first hits.
Cool!  What's your favorite Beatles song?
"Let It Be," how about yours?
"A Hard Day's Night."
That's a great one too!  When I hear that first note I get excited about the song!
Yes, it's much better than this song actually.
I agree, they got better later in their career.
