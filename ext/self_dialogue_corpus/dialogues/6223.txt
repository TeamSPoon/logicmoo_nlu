What do you think is the best musical Disney movie?
I think Aladdin is.
Really?
Yes. it has the most memorable song.
Which one?
A Whole New World.
That is a classic.
I think it is the best Disney song ever.
I don't know. Under the Sea is pretty good too.
True. But, A Whole New World is still the best.
