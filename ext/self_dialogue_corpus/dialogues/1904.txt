Who do you think is the top wide receiver in the league?
We can argue all day about that one.
Okay, who do you think are the top tier receivers?
Antonio Brown from the Steelers is top I think.
Don't you think Julio Jones from Atlanta is better?
Julio still has a little bit to work on in his game.
It seems like the guy breaks open every game.
What about Odell Beckham from the NY Giants?
I see him in the top ten but he does not have great top end speed.
Like DeSean Jackson?
He is a great over the top receiver but not overall plus is getting older.
Plus he has the big ego and occasional dumb play and doesn't do the possession receiving well.
I like the bigger body receivers who seem to do better overall.
Like Dez Bryant from Dallas?
He has the kind of build I think a prototype receiver should have.
Or like Alshon Jeffrrey?
We will see what kind of year he has after coming off of an injury year.
He was a big threat in the games I've seen him in, though.
And Jordy Nelson paired with Aaron Rogers is great.
Nelson makes Rogers all the more dangerous when he is on the field.
