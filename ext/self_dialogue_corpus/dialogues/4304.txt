What's a good thriller movie to watch?
I think you can't ever go wrong with The Shining.
I've never seen it.
Oh you need to watch it. Its got everything, action, drama, suspense. Jack Nicholson is incredible!
That's the one that takes place in the hotel, right?
Yes, its a big, creepy, old hotel.
Is it very bloody? I'm not into blood.
Only one scene is really bloody, but no one is bleeding.
What does that mean?
I guess you'll have to watch and see!
