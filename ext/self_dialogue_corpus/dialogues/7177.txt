It's been such a long time since I saw Toy Story!
Oh yeah, I know right? I love that movie.
Who was the one who wrote the music for that movie?
I think it was Randy Newman.
Oh yeah that sounds familiar.
Do you like a certain song in that movie or something?
Yeah. I really like "You've got a friend in me."
Oh yeah that's a great song.
Which songs do you like from Toy Story?
I really like that song when Buzz tries to fly. It's a good song, but kind of sad.
