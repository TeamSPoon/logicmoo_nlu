What rapper do you think doesn't get enough credit?
Big Sean, for sure. He is super goofy and completely misses with his lyrics sometimes, but..
But what?
He is a super positive rapper and he has the most fun cadences and ad libs.
I only know a few of his ad libs, like "BOY" and "I DO IT." You're right, those are fun.
Yeah, I really like how fun and goofy they are and I also like that he doesn't have to pretend to be some super hard gang member. He's putting himself out there saying this is who I am, take it or leave it.
Yeah, he has a few songs about finding your passion, appreciating your family, and working really hard. Definitely a positive message.
Right, he writes songs like "Bounce Back" which are about being resilient and struggling through adversity.
He's super confident on that track. I think it has a great message personally.
That's so true! Whether it's sports, music, business, relationships or whatever human endeavor, one has to be resilient and "bounce back."
