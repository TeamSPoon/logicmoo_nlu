Have you taken your kids to see the new Cars 3 movie?
No not yet! Have you taken your kids?
Yes! It was such a good movie! All the original characters are back. McQueen, Mater, Sally, Luigi, Guido, Mack, Red.
Oh that is awesome! The second Cars just wasn't that great and all the original characters weren't in it.
I know! I had reall high hopes for the Cars 3 and it didn't disappoint! I'm thinking of taking my kids a second time. In this one, McQueen is the old racer who is having trouble keeping up with the new, faster race cars.
Oh it was that good huh? Well looks like I need to get my kids to the theater soon! That sounds like a good story line!
Yes maybe we can take our kids together! When are you free?
Oh my kids would love that! Let me look at my calendar and get back to you.
Sounds great! Looking forward to it!
I'm preparing myself for all the Cars 3 items my kids will want me to buy after the movie, haha!
