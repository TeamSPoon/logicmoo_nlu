Do you like the Beatles?
Yeah, aren't those guys from England?
Yeah, I think so.
Why do you ask if I like them?
Because I'm a little lonely and would like for you to listen to them with me.
Okay, that would be cool.
Do you know much about them?
No, not very much.
Oh okay, I see. Maybe we can listen to their songs together sometimes.
Alright, no problem.
