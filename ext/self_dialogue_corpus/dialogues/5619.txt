Toy Story Three is the best movie of all time.
I know right! It had so many good elements!
It is actually the third-highest-grossing animated film of all time.
Wow! I did not know that, but I can see why.
I really like Woody.
Why?
Because he's an effective leader, he keeps everyone together. He has his flaws, but the movies allow him to grow past them.
That's true, I never thought of it that way.
Hey, when did that movie come out?
Um, I think around 2010.
