What inning is the current game in?
I think they are only in the second one
Whew i am glad then means i had not missed the game so far
Really because so far it is an amazing game
How amazing would you say it is
Gonzalez is breaking through every batter it is the game of the season.
Wow he sounds like he is on fire in the game.
he is on fire he is like a beast with that glove.
What channel can i watch the game on?
It is playing right now on Fox go to it quick.
Just turned to it the game looks like it is in full swing
it is for sure i am on the edge of my seat.
You think Johnson is gonna bat out of the park today or strike out?
He has to get out of the park he has it in him for sure.
I hope so he has skill but last season he messed up and i just kinda wonder how good he really is
Everyone messes up so i think the guy will do great when he is up to bat.
I guess your right but he cost them the playoffs you know
I would not blame just him i would say everyone on the team was at fault
Possibly but this game is fire and i think he is batting better at least so far.
That,s the spirit just believe in him.
