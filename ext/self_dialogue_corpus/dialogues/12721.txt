When did you first see Star Wars?
When I was 10.  I saw it at the theatres with my parents.
What did you think of it?
I thought it was the greatest thing i had ever seen!
It was so different and innovative.
I had dreams about it for a week after.
What kind of dreams?
About flying a tie fighter and trying to kill darth vader.
But if you are flying a tie fighter you would be on the dark side right?
Yes but i turned rebel.
