Was Rey living in Tatooine in the beginning part of Force Awakens?
No, that was a different planet called Jakku
Oh so another desert planet in the universe
Yeah I guess there were a lot of them
I liked how it had all the old star destroyers and other space junk on the planet
Yeah, I guess there was a big battle there back in the day
I guess that makes sense, there was more than just Endor
Yeah, the Empire was pretty big
We only got to see a portion of it
Yeah, but we saw the main parts.
