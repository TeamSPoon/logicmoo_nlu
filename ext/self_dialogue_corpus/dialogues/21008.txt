Ok, maybe not better than Pulp Fiction....
Good.  Because Hateful Eight was good, but not his best ever.
Right.  I forgot about all the other ones he made that are good too.
I know.  Do you remember Reservoir Dogs?
Oh yea.  I was just thinking about the one.  Mr. Pink, Mr. Orange.....classic.
Do you remember True Romance?  That was a good movie too.  One of his first.
Thats right.  That one still holds up.  I like the Kill Bill Movies too.
Did you like 1 or 2 better?
I liked 1 better.  Theyre both good, but the first one just felt more like a Tarantino movie.
Django Unchained was good, but not one of his best.  I think it was just to make a movie where he could say "nigger" over and over.
I liked it.  I liked Jamie Foxx and Christoph Waltz.  Hes a good actor.
Oh my God, he was so good in Inglorious Basterds!
That was a great one too!  I like his skewed history takes in these movies.
His style is so unique.  He liked the old 70s and Samurai movies a lot.  You can see it in his camera work.
Yes.  Jackie Brown and Kill Bill do just that.
I loved From Dusk Till Dawn.  George Clooney is awesome in that
So is Tarantino! I mean, hes not a great actor, but it was good for him
Hes supposedly doing a Kill Bill 3...
Dude, that'd be awesome!
Id definitely go see that!
