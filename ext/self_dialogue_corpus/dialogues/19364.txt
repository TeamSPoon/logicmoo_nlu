What ever happened to Karyn White?
I don't know.
I haven't heard any new music from her in a while.
I still listen to that album of hers with Superwoman on it.
That song and that album put her on the map.
She did that song The Way You Love Me.
My favorite off of that album was Secret Rendezvous.
Awe man, that was my joint.
I think I was a freshman in college when that came out.
That was like what, around 1988?
I think so.
I was listening to her and Guy.
You mean Teddy Riley and Guy?
Yeah. Their first album is a classic.
I like that song Spend The Night.
That one was hot.
I wonder if the three of them still do like tours and stuff together.
I don't think so. Remember Aaron Hall had left the group and went solo.
He had that joint Don't Be Afraid.
I know right. That was like 1990 and that song was killing it.
