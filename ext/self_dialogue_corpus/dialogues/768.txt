Who do you think the top NFL teams will be this year?
The Patriots will definitely be one of them.
Yes.  I think so for sure.
They are coming off a big high in winning the superbowl.
Yes that is very true.
But you know what?  They have been one of the top teams for like the last 10 years.
Yes.  They are either in the Superbowl or the conference final to go to the Superbowl most years.
Yep the Brady and Belichick duo is pretty good.
They are pretty much a dynasty team right now.
I think they have most of the core players coming back for this season so I don't see their winning ways changing.
The only thing is they had a chip on their shoulder for the last few years.
Yes, with the deflategate scandal.
Exactly.  I wonder if they will have a little less fire now that they silenced the critics with a Superbowl win.
I don't know. I think Brady is so mad he will have a chip on his shoulder for the rest of his career.
I think you are right.  He probably will try to win ever year until he retires to prove a point.
He's like forty so he does not have that many years left.
He's in freakishly good shape but you are right.  40 is pushing the limit.
I am thinking 2 to 3 years max.
As long as he can play at a high level I think he should play.
Yes.  I agree he should play and win more championships as long as he can.
