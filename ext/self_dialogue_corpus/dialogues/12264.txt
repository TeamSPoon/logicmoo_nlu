Did you see The Force Awakens?
Yeah it was good.  Not as good as the original films but still good.
I thought so too.  Except I'm not a Kilo Ren fan.
People seem to love or hate him.
I just think throwing tantrums is beyond a bad guy in Star Wars.
Yeah, I didn't care much for that.  But he did some impressive things.
Like stop that blast in mid air and still pull information from that guys mind.
I know, he has some serious power.
I would like to see better fight scenes in the next one.
Me too, I hope we see a lot more Luke.
