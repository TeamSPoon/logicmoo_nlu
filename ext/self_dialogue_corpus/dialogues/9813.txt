Are you going to see that new Tupac movie?
I'm thinking about it, but I've heard it wasn't good. A lot of inaccuracies.
They seem to be making a lot of movies about rap and hip-hop artistes these days.
I saw Straight Outta Compton and thought it was good.
For sure, that was probably one of the better ones. But the actual artists were involved in the production, so I'm not surprised it was so good.
What other rappers do you think there should be a movie about?
I'd like to see a movie about Queen Latifah.
Why her?
She's such a role-model for many type of minorities. She's a woman in business, black, LGBT, and has been able to be super successful after her start as a rapper.
Best of all, she's a very well respected actress now! She could act as herself!
