How many different actor played the batman in the recent times, anyway?
Define the "recent" times.
I knew you were gonna do that. Batman comics began in 1939. The TV show was in the 60s.
It ran from 1966 to 1968.
Yeah and then in the 90s, we had George Clooney.
No, we had MIchael Keaton as the first reincarnation of the Batman in 1989.
Oh Yeah. Michael Keaton as the action hero, whoda thunk?
Yep, he made 2 movies, and then Val Kilmer played one and then George Clooney stepped in.
And then the trilogy began.
Yep, with Christian Bale.
I don't know who I like the best.
Well, we have Ben Afleck who plays batman in the other series, Batman vs Superman.
Oh yeah. I don't like that series too much. it's just not believable.
What's there not to believe?
the whole ailen superhero gets killed because of this one rock from his home planet, oh my god, the Kryptonite. If their home world blew up how can they even have the rock?
it's the remnant from the blow up. Only because it blew up doesn't mean the matter disappeared.
So what you're saying is someone actually went and mined the blown up Krypton to find Kryptonite? Oh please, that's so stupid.
Not stupid at all.
Yes it is.
Well, we got it in meteor shower, so, there. Not stupid at all.
