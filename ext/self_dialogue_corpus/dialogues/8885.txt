Who was your favorite rock band of the 80's?
By far Guns N Roses!
I agree. Appetite for Destruction was and is the best album.
What song was your favorite? Mine was, Your Crazy.
It's hard to pick just one, but I'd say, Welcome to the Jungle.
That was a great video! Axel had some crazy hair.
The drummer looked out of place, but played the drums hard.
The all played hard. Watching Slash play the guitar in person was amazing!
How many times did you see them live?
I saw them a total of three times. One time was at Lollapalooza.
