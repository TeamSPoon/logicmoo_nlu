What did you think of the Super Bowl? Crazy game right?!
It was absolutely nuts. I cannot believe that the Falcons let the Patriots back into the game.
I was certain that the Falcons had the game won going into the fourth quarter.
As was I. I feel really bad for Falcons fans around the world.
Tom Brady may be the best quarterback to ever play the game.
I think you are right about that. I do not know any other quarterback that could have manufactured a comeback in a game like that.
When the game went to overtime and the Patriots won the toss I knew that the game was over.
Yeah, the Falcon's defense was gassed by then and the Patriots just marched down the field for the win.
I was at a party watching the game with a couple Falcons fans and they were in complete disbelief.
I can imagine so. I would be devasted if that happened to my team.
I feel bad for Matt Ryan. He played a great game and now he will be remembered for this loss.
Yeah I agree. I am happy for hi that he won MVP for the year.
Yeah he had a fantastic season and the offense was on fire all year long.
I did hear that their offensive coordinator is expected to take a head coaching job in Los Angeles.
Yeah I he is expected to sign with the Los Angeles Rams. Good move you think?
It's hard to say because he had a rough first year in Atlanta but then had a great year this year.
We will have to wait and see how they draft because they have a lot of needs.
They sure do need a lot of depth on both sides of the ball.
I am sad the NFL season is over. What will I do on Sundays now?
I know it always seems like weeks go slower when there is no football. I guess we will just have to wait.
