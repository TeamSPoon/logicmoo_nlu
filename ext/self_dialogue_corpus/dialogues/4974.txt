I'd like to know more about baseball.  What exactly is baseball?
It is a ball game between two teams of nine on a field with a diamond-shaped circuit of four bases.
It sounds fun and competitive.  Where is it played?
It is played in the US, Canada, Latin America, and East Asia.
What are the bases called?
First, second, third, and home plate.
What happens during baseball?
The batting team attempts to score runs by hitting a ball that is thrown by the pitcher with a bat swung by the batter, then running counter-clockwise around a series of four bases: first, second, third, and home plate. A run is scored when a player advances around the bases and returns to home plate.
It seems there is a lot going on with this sport.  Can you tell me more about it?
Players on the batting team take turns hitting against the pitcher of the fielding team, which tries to prevent runs by getting hitters out in any of several ways. A player on the batting team who reaches a base safely can later attempt to advance to subsequent bases during teammates' turns batting, such as on a hit or by other means.
You mention a pitcher. What are all of the positions played in baseball?
Pitcher, catcher, first baseman, second baseman, third baseman, shortstop, left fielder, center fielder, and right fielder.
How long does the game last?
A game is composed of nine innings, and the team with the greater number of runs at the end of the game wins. Baseball has no game clock, although almost all games end in the ninth inning.
I'm anxious to know where this sport came from? Do you know where it was first played?
In the 18th century in England.
You know so much about baseball. How do you know so much?
I played softball when I was younger.  I like to watch baseball also in my free time and have researched a lot about the sport.
It was so nice talking to you about baseball and I thank you very much!  I really learned a lot.
You are welcome. I enjoyed talking about this sport I enjoy.
