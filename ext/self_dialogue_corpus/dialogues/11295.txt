Are there any Beatles songs you hate?
I don't know about "hate."
What about "Revolution #9?"
Well, I don't like it.
Is it your least favorite?
You know, I always hated "Penny Lane."
Really?
I don't know why. Just sounds gross to me.
So you'd rather listen to "Revolution #9" than "Penny Lane?"
I guess that's right.
