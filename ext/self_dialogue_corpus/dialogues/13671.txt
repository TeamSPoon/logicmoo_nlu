What is your least favorite part of the new Star Wars?
Probably the bad guys.
Yeah, Kylo Ren is pretty bad.
Just a little to whiny for my taste.
I know! He's like a teen ager on a tantrum.
I'm not sure I like the Emperor type guy either.
I'm not real keen on him either.
Too much CGI.
That's how I feel too.
I wonder what they'll do in the next one.
