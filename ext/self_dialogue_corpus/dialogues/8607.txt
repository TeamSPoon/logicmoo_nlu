Remember Guns and Roses?
Yes I do. Axel Rose was a very good singer.
Slash played guitar and did very good too.
Yes Welcome to the Jungle was my favorite song, how about you?
Sweet Child O' Mine was my favorite, but I liked them all.
Too bad they all broke up.
I know that was really stupid.
Think of all the music they could of made.
We sure are missing out on that.
Yeah, they were great and could of gave us so much more.
