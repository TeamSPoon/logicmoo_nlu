So why does the secret organization of the killers..
The continentals. .
That's such a weird name for a secret contract killer brotherhood. Why are they call that?
I think it has to do with the hotel they operate out of. The contental hotel.
You know, that reminds me. Why is continental breakfast called that?
Oh I don't know. I don't care.
Because they make food from European continent. For real. Look it up.
I don't need to look it up,. I already knew.
You said you didn't know.
I know I said that. I only said that because i don't want to discuss it.
Anyway, do they have continental breakfast in this continental hotel? Hah, see what I did there?
Sigh, I don't know. But anyway that's the name of the rogue group of this elite assassins.
if John Wick kill a buhnch of them by himself, they're not so elite.
Or John Wick is just that much of a bad ass that he IS.
So Santino dies and then what? What happens to the contract Santino put on Wick's head?
You know.. I don't know. i think you might have something there. that actually might be an untied loose end in the movie.
Maybe we missed it?
No., I'm pretty sure I didn't miss it. Oh wait, I know what happened.
What?
Santino doesn't get to cancel the contract because he's dead, but the head of the Continetals, the High Table, doubles the contract because the killing was done in the continental hotel. So Not a loose end at all. just developed into more severe form of problem for Wick.
