What type of music have you been listening too lately?
Mostly rock and roll.
Where do you normally listen?
I love my Sirius radio.
I've heard of that, what is it?
It's commercial free radio with different channels focused on a particular music genre.
What was the last album that you bought?
I got the new Metallica last week.
Did you like it?
Yes. It was a return to their old stuff in my opinion. Had a real hard feel to it.
I recently started buying albums again.
The actual vinyl records?
Yes. I really love the sound and feel of them.
I have so many great rock albums from when I was a kid.
They might actually be worth some money.
I think I'd rather hold on to them for sentimental value.
I just love the album art on most rock records.
I agree. They helped tell the story of the album.
I remember standing in line at midnight to get the Guns N Roses Use Your Illusion albums when they first came out.
That brings back memories. Consuming music back then was much different than today.
