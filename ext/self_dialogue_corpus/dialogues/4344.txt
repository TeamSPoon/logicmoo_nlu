Jurassic Park was a pretty good thriller back in the 90's.
Nothing like big, killer dinosaurs to keep you on your toes.
That was such a huge spectacle back then.
It was one of those quintessential summer movies.
Spielberg delivered the goods for sure.
The movie was truly scary.  I mean, what would you do?
I'd run from the dinosaurs.
I would have just hidden from them.
Easier said then done when they could just smash your building.
Good point.  Maybe I shouldn't visit the island.
