I can't wait for Incredibles 2 to come out.
Me either but I don't even know a release date.
I know! It's just so hard to wait for something so great.
I heard that frozone not going to be in the movie.
What are you talking about. You can't do the incredibles 2 without frozone.
That's what I was saying but you never know.
Disney comes out with great movies
I know but the incredibles have got to be the best.
Your right about that.
I know I am.
