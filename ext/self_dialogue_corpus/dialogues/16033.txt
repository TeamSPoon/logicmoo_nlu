What's your favorite kind of music?
I would probably say country, but I really like a bit of everything.
That's good. I like a lot of different music genres too.
I have always had a varied taste in music.
Who's your favorite country singer?
Brad Paisley is probably my favorite, although I prefer his old stuff.
His song "We Danced" was just used as a wedding song at a reception I just went to.
I know it was very popular. His first album is probably my favorite, but he has released a lot of good songs since then.
Have you every seen him in concert?
Yes I have. He is a very good performer and is also very good at playing the guitar.
What would you say is your second favorite type of music?
I would say that rock would be my second favorite.
That is probably my favorite. What are some of your favorite bands?
I really like the Dave Matthews.
They are amazing in concert. You should see the drum set that their drummer uses.
It really is amazing. I have been to a couple of their concerts.
"Ants Go Marching" is my favorite song by them.
They really do have a lot. I can pretty much sing along with their whole set list.
Would you go to see them again if they came anywhere near us.
I definitely would. I would see them anytime they are within a couple hours of where I'm at.
