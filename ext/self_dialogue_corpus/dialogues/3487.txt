I saw this great movie last night called, The Babadook.
Never heard of that.
You should look it up. It is Australian and not your usual horror movie.
What do you mean?
Well it is more psychological than the usual slasher type horror movies. It has a good story line about a mother and her son.
I like psychological horror too more than just blood and guts. I like to get really scared and the usual stuff just grosses me out.
Well you'll like this then. The son thinks the monster in a pop-up book is real and he makes weapons to defend himself and his mother.
So the kid is the hero
Kind of. The movie is more about the dark side of grief. You see the mother Amelia, her husband is killed in a car accident the night Sam is born and she never quite got over it.
Ok, I'm going to take your advice and look for it. We can talk more about it after I watch it.
