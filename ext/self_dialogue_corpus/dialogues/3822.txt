Did you ever see that Don't Breathe movie?
I might have.  Wasn't that the one about the teen thieves?
Kind of.  They broke into this guy's house and the guy is blind.
Right.  But all of his other senses are really heightened.
Yep.  So he ends up hunting them in his house.
Kind of a weird dynamic.  The kids aren't good guys, but neither is he.
In some ways, they got what they deserved.
To a point, but being killed for trespassing is pretty harsh.
On a whole, it's worth watching once, but would never buy it.
Agreed.  I feel that way about most of these run of the mill thriller flicks.
