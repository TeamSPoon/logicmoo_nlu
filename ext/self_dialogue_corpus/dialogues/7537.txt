Have you seen all Harry Potter movies?
I did, and I didn't really like them?
Why not?
Well after the reading the books the movies left a lot to be desired.
I agree, I think the movies almost made it into a kid genre when it wasn't like that before.
What do you think could've changed that?
I think if they incorporated some more "adult" type themes it could've been better?
Adult themes like what?
Just more gore and maybe some swearing.
Yea, when I was a teenager I was cursing up a storm.
