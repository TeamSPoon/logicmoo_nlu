You know, people are really hard on Snape for the way he treated Neville Longbottom.
Well, he was kind of a jerk.
Yeah, but have you ever thought about why?
Not really. I just figured he hated him because he wasn't good at magic.
I think it's a bit more complicated than that.
How so?
According to the prophecy, "the chosen one" was supposed to be born at the end of July. Neville was born around the same time as Harry.
So as far as Voldemort knew, it could've been either of them?
Yep, only he chose to go after Harry. If he'd chosen Neville instead, Lily would still be alive.
Oh! Well, I guess that explains it.
