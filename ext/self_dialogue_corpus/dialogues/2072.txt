I'm curious. Does every state have their own football team?
No. Only 22 states have football teams.
That means less than half of the states in the United States have teams.
You're correct.
But it seems like there are more than 22 teams.
There are. Some states have more than one team.
Which state has the most?
California has more teams than any other state.
How many teams does it have?
It has four teams altogether.
I know it has the 49ers and Raiders. What are the other teams?
It also has the Rams and the Chargers.
What are some of the states that don't have teams?
Alabama, Nevada, Oregon and Alaska.
I guess Alaska makes sense because of the weather.
Alaska actually had an indoor football team at one time that was known as Alaska Wild.
Were they part of the NFL or AFL?
No. They were a part of Intense Football League.
Are they still around?
No. They played their last game in 2010.
