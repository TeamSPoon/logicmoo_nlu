Have you seen the new comedy that came out recently? It's called Chips.
No, I have not seen that one yet.
Me neither. i am hoping to watch it this weekend. I always been a fan of the show called Chips, when I was younger.
Me too! I watched the show everyday after I came home from school. Ponch and Jon always cracked me  up.
It will be nice to see a modern version of them. Do you know what actors will play Ponch and Jon?
I do. Ponch will be played by Micheal Pena and Jon by Dax shepard.
I have heard of Micheal as an actor but never heard of Dax. Is he a newcomer to the acting business?
I don't know. He might be. I can look him up on IMDB later and text you about it.
Okay. I don't think it matters though, he seems like he portrays a funny Jon character.
Yeah, I think we will get some good laughs from Chips regardless.
