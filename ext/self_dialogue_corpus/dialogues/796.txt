Did you catch the draft?
No, I totally missed it, What happened?
Well as usual Belicheck made careful choices
I just love this guy
I know me too. It just gets it
I wish we could clone him
Well, him and Brady. The guy is a machine.
I know. Its just amazing.
The amazing thing is they just find people for the system
I know it. How?
Maybe they are smarter than everyonelse?
Must be something in the water
What did you think of this years picks
I thought they were solid
yeah, I was a bit confused but I guess there is a bigger picture
Maybe, drafting for what they think they can become?
Or trading pieces down the road
I guess..I never thought of that
I am glad other teams don't get this idea
No kidding...thanks Jets
