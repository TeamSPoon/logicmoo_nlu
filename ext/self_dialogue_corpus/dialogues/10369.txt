Hi, how are you?
I'm great. How are you? What did you do over the weekend?
I'm good. I took my family to the movies to see the new Diary of a Winpy Kid Movie.
Oh, Diary of a Wimpy Kid the Long Haul, right?
That's the one.
What did you think?
It really wasn't very good. They have an entirely new cast and the previous cast was much better than the current one.
Oh really? That's too bad. I read that it received a rating of around 17 percent on rotten tomatoes.
Unfortunately, I read that after I had already watched it in the theater.
Doesn't Alicia Silverstone play the mother?
Yes, she does. Every time I saw her, I thought about that movie she was in a long time ago, Clueless.
I loved that movie!
Me too, it was fantastic.
What year was Clueless released? I can't remember.
Clueless came out in 1995 I think. I remember because I know what grade I was in at the time.
Paul Rudd was great in that movie too.
I agree, he played her step brother. The one she ended up being in love with at the end.
Yes, I hadn't seen that coming at the beginning.
Well, it was fun to reminisce about a great 90s movie but getting back to Diary of a Winpy Kid, I would skip it if I were you.
Thanks, I will. I'll wait for the next family movie to come out.
