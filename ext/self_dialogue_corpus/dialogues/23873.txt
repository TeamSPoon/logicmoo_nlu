Are you excited about the new Despicable Me movie?
Absolutely!  I love those movies.
What is your favorite thing about them?
I absolutely love the minions.
They are really cute.
I can't understand a single thing they say!
I know.  That's part of the fun.
But when they come on screen, you know something funny is going to happen.
They don't follow any normal rules of behavior.
They remind me of a bunch of preschoolers.  They just do whatever they want to do.
But they get to the truth of things.
Do you have a favorite one?
I always laugh at the one who says his name is "Bob!"
I kind of like Stuart.
I like the way Jerry plays the Guitar.
His spikey hair is kind of cool, too.
It amazes me that Gru seems to understand what they are saying.
It's a fake.
FAKE NEWS.
No.  FAKE Understanding.  Needed a Trump joke here,.  (All the minions laugh)
