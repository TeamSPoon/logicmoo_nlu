Do you like country?
Yeah I do, I used to listen to it all the time.
Cool, who did you like?
My favorite was Kenny Chesney.  But I also liked Zack Brown Band a lot.
They're really good.  I heard them do Devil Went Down to Georgia in double time.
I saw that video on Youtube.  That was flat out crazy.
I also like their song with Chris Cornell.  Heavy is the Head.
Yeah, that was awesome.
How about Garth Brooks?
King of country for sure.  Maybe not on the tip top anymore but there will never be another Garth.
He's kind of on the same level as a country Elvis or Beatles.
I know and he's quite the performer too.
Yeah, he is.  Who else do you like?
I like Jason Aldene.
Yeah his style has a bit of a cool swing to it.
What about Dirks Bently?
I like him too.  I forgot about him.
Don't forget Toby Keith.
Yeah with his best song ever.
