So, I went to All Eyez on Me, finally.
Oh yeah? Why did you do that?
Well, Tupac Shakur, he was a giant figure in music, really. In politics too, I guess, or in culture, you might say.
Yeah. So now you feel you know him?
I don't know about that. I knew nothing about him before, now I think I know a little bit.
You mean the film seemed kind of shallow. That's what I've heard from other people too.
He really did have an interesting life, they did show that. His mother had a strong influence on him, plainly.
Mothers do, and she was very political. As a  Black Panther, you know.
Yeah I know, now. That's the thing, people like me know nothing about Tupac's life, really.
I'm not sure you'll really get to know him from this little biopic though.
Yet it's an introduction to his life, and his music.
I don't know if you got a real idea of his power and the strength of his ideas.
I'm going to learn more. Plainly the film was meant as a sort of sketch of the man.
I bet it spent lots of time on his romances, too. And on his legal problems.
Yes it did. Those were some of the more sensational elements of his life.
But don't you think there was more to him than that? He  was an artist, with a great mind.
I dont know if you got that from the movie. I got how much trouble he was in.
His violent death, too, I'm sure that was a big plot point.
Yes, of course. It's still a mystery--Tupac is still a mystery to me, really.
Well, just listen to his music. That's how to know him.
