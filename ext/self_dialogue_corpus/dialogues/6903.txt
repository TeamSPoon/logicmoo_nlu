Do you think Jack Sparrow is getting too old?
What do you mean?
In the most recent movie, he looked... old.
Yeah.  People age.
You know what I mean.  It seems like Johnny Depp is just getting a bit old.
He's like 50-something.  Of course he's going to look older.
I was just expecting him to do more stunts and stuff.
When you're 50, I doubt you'll be jumping around.
I'll be sitting on my couch watching Johnny Depp do it instead.
Oh brother.
