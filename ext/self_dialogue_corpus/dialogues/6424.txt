Which Disney movie princess has the prettiest dress?
I liked Rapunzel from the movie Tangled.
Are you sure that's a Disney movie.
Yes, it is - I liked her purple dress.
Ok, yeah you're right.  I think my favorite is Belle's yellow dress.
I wore that for Halloween once, it was really pretty.
Merida's dress from Brave looked cool.
Yeah, but I think it would be really hot to wear, it had a lot of layers.
Then you could wear Ariel's dress, since the top is only a bikini.
Yeah, she did get a different dress to wear on land though.
