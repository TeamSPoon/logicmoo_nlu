I can watch the falcons all day
They definitely have one of the most high powered offenses
Matt Ryan is a really good young player
I think that they are going to be competitive for a while
As long as their offense stays
Julio Jones is really fun to watch also
He's one of the best players in the league
I don't know if I'd go that far but he's definitely one of the best wide recievers
Him and Odell Beckham definitely are
Odell is really entertaining to watch
I love watching him
He's one of the most dynamic, entertaining players in the league for sure
I think he is one of the only bright spots on the Giants
I think that Odell will eventually leave the Giants though when he realizes they have no chance for a title
Yeah that makes sense especially after he makes his millions
He should look to a team with a more elite offense.
Can you imagine him playing with Tom Brady?
That team would be deadly and the patriots would win the next 5 super bowls
As fans of other teams, let's pray that never happens!
I'm with you on that!
