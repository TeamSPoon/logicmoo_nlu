Are you a fan of hip-hop music at all?
Not especially, why?
Just wondering.
Yeah I just feel like I can;t relate to a lot of hip-hop.
What do you mean?
Well, sometimes I feel like a poser being a white person and listening to rap!
Yeah, I can see how that'd happen.
There is some really cheesy rap written by white artists though.
What do you mean by cheesy?
Have you ever heard of Lil Dicky?
No, is that a rapper?
Yeah.
What's he like? It's a weird name.
He's a super dorky Jewish guy, and a lot of his raps are parodies of just that.
Sounds fun!
Yeah, the music videos for some of his songs are pretty histerical too.
This is definitely something I wanna check out.
Yeah, please do! Then we can talk about him.
What should I listen to first?
Check out the song Ex-Girlfriend, but be sure to watch the music video!
