Do you like the original cartoon Jungle Book or the live action Jungle Book better?
I like the live action one better.
Why?
I think a fantastic job was done making the animals come to life.
I know. They looked so real to me.
Me, too. I also thought the kids who played Mowgli did a good job.
He had good facial expressions.
He also was so agile.
That must have been so much fun to play that role.
I think so, too.
