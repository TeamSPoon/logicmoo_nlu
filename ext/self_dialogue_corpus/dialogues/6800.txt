What do you think is the most iconic Disney movie from your childhood?
For me it was the Little Mermaid, hands down.
Yes! Such a good Disney movie!
I remember I wanted to be Ariel. Like the red hair, the seashell bra, the fins, everything.
Who wouldn't? Prince Eric was totally my first crush.
I know! I was in love with him.
And I remember thinking Scuttle and Sebastian were hilarious.
Yea, Scuttle and all of his false knowledge about human objects.
So funny! And Ariel totally believes whatever he says.
Such a good movie. I need to buy it on DVD for when I have kids.
