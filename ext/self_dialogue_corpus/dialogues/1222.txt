I wouldn't count out Green Bay just yet either.
Yea, just when you think they are done, they start winning.
Last year at one point, they looked awful. Then look.
Yea, they made a nice run to the playoffs.
Well, you know this is a quarterback driven league.
You're right. With a top 3 quarterback, you can always be in contention.
I completely agree, but you also need playmakers and I'm just not sure Rodgers has that anymore.
Well, he has some guys to throw to, but I'm not sure if they can stop anybody.
Yea, I can't even name anyone on that defense.
Yea, neither can opposing offenses.
Well, its been that way for New Orleans now for years.
Brees throws for 500 yards and 4 touchdowns and still loses.
Yea, it has been. They have made very little effort to improve that defense.
Yea, it is a shame because Brees isn't getting any younger.
Yea, they did add Adrian Peterson, but it seems like he is washed up anyway.
Yea, he might just be a goal line back there.
I thought he might try to win a starting job. It looks like thats not really available there.
True, but you really never know with injuries.
Yea, its amazing how short of a career running backs have.
Yea, well they take a lot of hits thats for sure.
