Has Lady Gaga come out with any new music lately?
Yes, she released an album last year.
Do you know the name of it?
It's called Joanne. That's her middle name.
That's really cool. I bet there are some amazing tracks on that album.
Definitely. She really focuses on her vocals, instead of the beats with this one.
My favorite record so far has been Million Reasons.
That song is perfect. A lot of other artists have made covers of that song.
I can't wait until she goes on tour. Will you go with me to her concert?
I would love to!
