Who are you going for this season?
I haven't quite decided.
Are you going for the home team?
Which of the two is my home team?
Well, you do live a little closer to Houston
It takes the same length of time to go to Arlinton or Houston
I've decided on The Astros myself
Just for that, I might just Pick the Rangers.
Well they do have good pitching.
And the Astro have very good offense.
Are you going to many games.
Yeah, I sure.
I get tickets occasional as perks.
To which games?
The Rangers.
So, you might as well root for the team you'll happen to get tickets for.
Yeah. Last years I got 3 pairs.
Are they usable on any home game?
Any game that is not sold out
Could I go with you?
