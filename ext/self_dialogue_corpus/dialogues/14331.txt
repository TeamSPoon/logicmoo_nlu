Did you hear that the playoffs are starting?
Already? Seems like this season by went so fast..
I'm kind of relieved since baseball is in full effect by now
I hear ya, i wish they wouldnt have the NHL playoffs at the same time as basketball.
Anyways I also think theres too many teams in the playoffs, its not even competitive til the conference finals most years.
I feel the same way, its pretty ridiculous to have almost 2 months of playoffs in a sport, even baseball doesn't seem as bad with it.
Who are you rooting for?
The Spurs...but theyll have a tough road...you know how the Cavs just march through the east each year without any competiton...
What about the Celtics?
They have no chance...I like their coach though
Still, I think they're off to a great start after tanking 3 years ago, and they have all th ose draft picks including #1.
Wow really?  That is crazy.
Its kind of crazy to think about the Lakers aren't in the playoffs again...i bet LA is pissed.
They have the Clippers though...
I meant like a real team.
Still they sucked for so long I'm glad to see them turning it around..but no shot for the next 10 or so years against the Warriors
Does anyone though?
Well the Spurs...
Lol anyways...
Come on they got this!
