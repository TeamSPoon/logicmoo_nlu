Hey, did you hear about Monday Night Football?
No, what?
Hank Jr. is back!
Awesome, maybe the NFL will end the PC crap.
Madden and hank Jr., that's football to me.
I think we're getting old...lol.
Man, this time of the year I begin itching for some football.
I know what y ou mean,  that first pre-season game is almost as exciting as the superbowl to me.
How are your Bears going to do?
Honestly, I'll be surprised if we make the playoffs.
There's always some team that comes out of nowhere and surprised.
Maybe Cleveland?
The Browns?  Ha! not a chance.
I heard that Johnny Football was looking for another chance.
I'd sign Tebow before giving Johnny another chance.
Tebow is playing baseball these days.
Who do you think improves the most this year?
Maybe Washington?  They're due. So much wasted talent.
I think it will be a breakthrough year for the Titans.
Maybe, but they need better blocking. No run game.
