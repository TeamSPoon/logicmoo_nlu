Whats your favorite mafia action movie?
Wow that's a good question. I would have to say Donnie Brasco.
I love that movie! There's some intense parts in it.
Yeah like how they chop the guys up in the basement.
Did you know that it is based on a true story?
Wow, that's pretty messed up.
Yeah, it is hard to believe how ruthless the mafia was.
It is probably the reason why the mafia fell apart.
I agree, they associated with too many killers, even though they were mainly about business.
It's a good thing that kind of stuff is illegal or they would control everything.
