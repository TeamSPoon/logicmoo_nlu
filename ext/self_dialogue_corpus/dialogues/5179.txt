What are your favorite Disney films?
The Little Mermaid. Aladdin. Pocahontas. Cinderella. The Hunchback of Notre Dame. Peter Pan . Snow White
Those are all good ones.
I  also really like Tarzan and The Lion King.
They both have a jungle them, do you also love The Jungle Book?
I like the newer version better than the animated film but yes that too.
What do you like about them so much?
Well Tarzan was the first time that Disney changed up the formula some.
How did they do that exactly?
It was the first time they did not have the characters sing the song themselves. You will notice it is phil colins singing the songs not any character.
