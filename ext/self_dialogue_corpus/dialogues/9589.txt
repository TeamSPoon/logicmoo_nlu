Are you going to the Macklamore and Ryan Lewis show?
Yes, I'm super excited.
I'm so glad you got tickets. I know you're a huge fan.
I am. I've listened to them since before The Heist came out.
What is your favorite song by them?
I really like Same Love a lot. Its such a powerful song.
Its a beautiful song, I cried the first time I heard it.
I love that they are so involved in getting equality for everyone.
Yeah, its always good when a musician or group is socially conscious.
That's a big part of the reason why I like them some much.
