I like BORN THIS WAY by Lady Gaga.
She referRed to herself as the ETERNAL MOTHER.
I think she means mother of the LITTLE MONSTERS.
She said there was another birth.
Her evil self was born.
Kind of like she was 2 people.
She said how can I protect something so pure.
And she said without evil.
Then the beat goes hard.
I'm glad she always dances in her videos.
