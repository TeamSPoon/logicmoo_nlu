Ya I thought she had some great movies.
You know what superhero movie I really enjoyed was Wonder Woman.
Oh really I want to go see that.
Ya it's great how she is a strong powerful woman and actually fights.
Don't tell me too much I'm so excited to see it.
I think you will love it. I wouldn't mind seeing it again.
That's awesome. Just tell me this as a female superhero how would you rank her?
I would put her at number one.
That's amazing. I am so excited.
Let me know what you think when you watch it!
