Didn't you see India Arie in concert last year?
I did! She has such good music.
Where did you see her at?
I saw her in Sydney, Australia. Why do you ask?
Well, I won two tickets to see her the other day on a radio station.
Get out! You're not even familiar with her music are you?
Not really. I was going to see if you wanted the tickets.
I will totally take those tickets. You could come with me.
I don't know. I do not know any of her songs.
Well, you can listen to some of her music before the concert.
That is a good idea. I can stream some of her songs on my phone.
When is the concert.
It is next Thursday at 8:00 PM.
That blows. I have to work!
Can you try to get rid of your shift?
For India Arie, I will call in sick.
I think you should at least get rid of your shift before you call in.
Don't worry, I will. Let me see your phone.
Why do you want to see my phone?
Because I am going to find some of her best songs so you can become familiar with her music.
