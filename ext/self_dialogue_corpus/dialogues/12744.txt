So what gives with the twins kissing?
Huh?
Luke and Leia.
Oh, yeah. That was bizzar.
They kiss in the second, and then in the third Leia indicates that she's always known they were siblings.
Gross.
I think Lucas just came up with the siblings bit in the third movie.
Writing off the cuff?
Yeah, he's pretty infamous for that.
True.
