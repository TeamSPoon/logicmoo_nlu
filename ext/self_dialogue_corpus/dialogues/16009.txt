What ever happened to Dizzee Rascal?
I don't know, isn't he still making music?
I don't think so. I haven't heard anything new in a while.
Hmmmm. Come to think of it, neither have I.
And you listen to grime all the time.
I do. Radio One for life.
For life.
So now I'm curious. What DID ever happen to Dizzee?
If I knew I wouldn't have asked, silly. I haven't heard anything from him since about a year after his concert.
Oh wow, memories! That show was so fun.
I know, we danced the whole night, remember that?
Yep. And if I recall correctly he was doing some flirting up there on stage.
Yes, indeed he was. Giving me and my droogs the old elevator eyes, am I right?
Right you are, matey. I think he rapped at us disrespectfully too though, so it kinda doesn't count.
Eh. I guess not.
Guys are dogs.
For life.
Still though. That was an excellent show and I haven't stopped loving grime.
Me neither. No worse for the wear, anyway.
So yeah. What ever happened to Dizzee Rascal?
