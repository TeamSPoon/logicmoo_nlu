I am ready to watch some football
Me too. Love the NFL.
Do you think some of the players are rough.
Yeah i think some of the players are a little too rough.
Yeah they should get penalized.
Some do and they get fined.
Yeah some are harsh fines too.
I think that is right but everyone should be treated the same.
I agree. Some do not get fined at all.
Sometimes they are so rough someone could get hurt.
I have seen that.
It gets scary.
Yeah you never know how bad it can get.
Someone could get a bad concussion.
Some get paralyzed.
It is scary and some should be careful.
Yes that is why I think they should have more firm rules.
I agree it could take someones life.
Let alone their career.
Maybe one day they will stop being so rough.
