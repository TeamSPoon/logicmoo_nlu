Do you watch the NFL?
I do but not as much as I used to.
Do you have a favorite team?
I enjoy watching the browns.
Why the browns?
I like watching them because it was my dads favorite team so I became a fan at a young age.
That makes sense.
I also like how they play smash mouth football.
They do play that old school style.
I really like it.
That's what football is all about.
I can't agree more.
I enjoy the Indianapolis Colts.
Why?
Same reason as you my dad was a big fan of them.
Any other teams.
I also like Green Bay and the Favre era.
He was so passionate.
He made football at that time nobody played like him.
I can't agree more.
