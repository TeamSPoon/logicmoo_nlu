I saw a top ten lisit of the 10 saddest Disney movies.
Wait, let me guess... the saddest one would be... Bambi.
I thought so too !!! But no, Bambi was number four on the list.
What was the saddest one?
A movie called UP. Lion King was second, and The Fox and The Hound was third.
Lion King was pretty sad when Simba was snuggled up next to his dead dad.
Yeah, I guess it's the child losing a parent that really tugs on the heartstrings. Dumbo was number 7 because of his mother rocking him through the cage with her trunk.
Aw, that was really sad. There's something about cartoon characters with tears that makes me have tears too.
There was one I had forgotten about though that was number 5, and when I saw it thought that should have been up there in the top 3- Old Yeller.
Oh my gosh, that was really heartbreaking. I don't think anybody has ever watched Old Yeller and not shed a few tears.
