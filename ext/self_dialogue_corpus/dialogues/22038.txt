What is up with the new Transformers movie?
Don't even get me started on that!
Why does Micheal Bay have to destroy my favorite childhood toy?
Because he likes to make money.
Well, maybe he should make money with another franchise.
But, what other movie would Mark Wahlberg star in this year?
Who cares.  I hate that guy!
He is pretty terrible.
Marky Mark, but don't call him that.
I hope Optimus Prime accidentally crushes him in the new movie.
That would be hilarious!
Optimus is supposed to be the bad guy in the movie.  It could happen.
Optimus as a bad guy seems weak.
I think they ran out of plot twists.
Probably, but they want to milk the franchise.
Unfortunately, it's all too common these days.
Look at Indiana Jones....
No, let's not ever mention that travesty again.
Ok.  How about the new Blade Runner?
That one looks good.  I hope they do it justice.
