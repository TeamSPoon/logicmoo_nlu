What is your favorite Disney movie?
I think Mulan is my favorite.
Really? I feel like Mulan wasn't that good. I prefer Tarzan.
I had forgotten about Tarzan. That was a really good movie.
Indeed! However, if you count the new Star Wars movies as Disney movies, I would chose those as my favorites.
Of course! Those have to be the best ones. Have you heard about the new episode coming on this year?
Yes! Episode 8 looks promisng.
I feel like I shouldn't have big expectations in case it is not that good.
Don't worry. It will be really good.
We will see.
