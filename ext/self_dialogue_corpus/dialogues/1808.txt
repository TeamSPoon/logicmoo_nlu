So who is your favorite NFL team?
I'm a Cowboys fan. You?
Ugh I hate the Cowboys!
Yeah I hear that a lot. So what is your reason?
I just hate all the attention they get!
Well that is true I suppose. So what team do you follow?
I really like the Patriots. They have been on a really good run.
Ah yeah they have. Are you from New England?
No I'm from out west.
How long have you been a Pats fan?
Just a few years. I didn't follow football as a kid.
Really? I've been a Cowboy's fan my whole life! I remember watching them win with Emmit Smith!
Who is Emmit Smith?
Ugh, and you call yourself a football fan? He holds the record for most rushing yards in a career.
Huh, I did not know that.
Emmit Smith won 3 Superbowls with the Cowboys in the 90's.
When is the last time they won a Superbowl?
The 90's.
Man, it must have been a tough 20 years for Cowboy's Fans.
Yeah, I can assure you it has been tough.
