What do you think of the new Star Wars Trailer for the Last Jedi?
I think it looks amazing!
Yes! I'm really hoping they finally reveal who Rey really is.
Well if you notice in the Force Awakens, when Rey finds the lightsaber, its the voices of the old and young Obi Wan Kenobi.
Maybe shes actually realted to Obi Wan and not Skywalker like everyone thinks.
Or it could be both.
I'm also curious as to whats going on with Kylo Ren.
Yeah, and what Supreme Leader Snoke is doing and who he actually is.
I'm just excited to see Mark Hamill-Luke Skywalker again!
Hopefully this time he gets to actually say something.
