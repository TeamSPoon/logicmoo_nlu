Do you know Oprah did a voice for a Disney ?
Really, which one?
The Princess and the Frog, she was the voice for Edora.
That was a cute movie, wasn't John Goodman a voice in that one too.
I think he was the voice for Big Daddy' La Bouff.
If I was a celebrity I would do voices for cartoons. I think that is so cool.
For sure, look at Toy Story with Tom Hanks and Tim Allen.
Oh my goodness it had so many celebrity voices in it like Don Rickles, Anne Potts, and John Ratzenberger.
I did not know Don Rickles did a voice, what character was he?
Mr. Potato Head isn't that fitting?
