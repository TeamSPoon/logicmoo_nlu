Did you see the Lego Batman Movie?
Yeah. It was really great.
I thought so too. It was cool how they included tons of "Easter eggs" for Batman fans.
I really liked that as well. They included elements from all sorts of Batman related media.
Totally true. They incorporated the comic books, movies, and even the 60's TV Show.
That was less surprising than including a brief reference from the 1930's serials.
It was awesome to see all of the Batman characters and villains in Lego form on the big screen.
Yeah, you don't realize the sheer volume of imagination that has gone into the decades of the Batman Universe.
Getting to see it on screen all at one time is surely an impressive thing to see.
I agree. I thought it was great.
The Lego movies in general have all been good. I really liked the original The Lego Movie as well.
I agree. Both the movies created these great immersive worlds that totally fit with the toys they are based on but provided great, fun story lines as well.
It helps that the toys themselves are so versatile and conducive to creativity.
That's true. The whole "master builder" idea that is represented in both movies is pretty much defined by the toys the movies are based on.
Well, really the whole physics and boundaries of the worlds are pretty much defined by the Lego toys that comprise them.
Yeah, I guess that's true, but it does make for an interesting reality to set a movie plot into.
Well, I think it's part of why these movies work so well.
Right, although the stories in both movies are pretty solid as well.
Both movies just hit well on so many levels.
Yeah, they cater to kids, fans of the Lego toys, fans of comic books and a variety of other entertainment media. They're both just really good movies.
