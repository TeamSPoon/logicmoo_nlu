What is the best part of rock music to you?
I would have to say the guitarists. They do stuff that no other genre can hope to match.
What do you mean?
People can usually tell what a particular song is by the guitar riff alone. No other genre can do that.
That's true. U2's "New Year's Day" is a good example of that.
I love that song, but I'm not so sure about their new work.
You're right. It's not as iconic as their earlier stuff.
It depends. I like "Beautiful Day," but not "Vertigo."
I feel the same way.
Want to play a game of "Name That Song?"
