Why are the Cubs losing?
Almost nobody in the infield is playing up to expectations.
But Kris Bryant is having a stellar year.
He certainly is, but Rizzo and Swarber are really is a funk.
It is the sophomore jinx.
How about Theo Epstein, though(The Cubs General Manager)
He sure is a wunderkind.Speaking of Theo, how are my Red Sox doing?
I hear that Sale is outperforming expectations.
He sure is, amazing! He is leading the AL in strikeouts by a large margin.
That trade is working out.But, GM Dave Dombrokski also seems to have made some dubious moves.
Time will tell.Anderson Espinozo was NOT part of that trade.He is a top prospect.
I know, I was traded even up for that lefty.
I think you are referring to Drew Pomeranz. I think he is pitching alright.
Well, he may be "alright", but that is not good enough.
Yes, I agree, and David Price has yet to throw his first pitch of 2017.
They sure dodged a bullet there.Early reports indicted Tommy John surgery, with a return in mid 2018.
He really underperformed last year, even though he may have won around 17 games.
Well, that may be correct, but for 30 million a year, you need to pitch better than he did.
He easily could have won 20 games, the way the Sox hit behind him.
I know, and even though I always liked the guy, he threw a real stinker in last year;'s playoff appearance.
