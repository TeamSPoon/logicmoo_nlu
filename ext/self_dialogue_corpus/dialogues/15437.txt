I can't believe that people still make fun of the Monkees.
I know.  It's amazing. Their music is not only great, but it totally holds up.
Yeah, and it's as strange as any music of the time.
I totally agree.  Even if they didn't write it all or even play it all doesn't matter.
I totally agree.  The Beach Boys used studio musicians.
I know, even The Byrds did, and they were known for their playing.
So true -- in fact, they all used pretty much the SAME studio musicians.
And what about Headquarters?
Totally! They wrote all of it, and it was fabulous!
I agree. They were equally as strange and good, musically, as anyone else of the time.
I think Elvis got a bad shake in the 60s, too.
Oh, yeah, a lot of his movies, even, were really good. He could just sing like no tomorrow.
I think so, too.  I still watch Blue Hawaii every Christmas.
I love Blue Hawaii!  Elvis is like Bing. It's like singing is what I do, it's so easy.
That's just what it's like! Like it's so easy, it's nothing at all!
I think they had to beat Elvis to make sure the Beatles got full market share in '64.
Yeah, I agree.  Really, there was room for both of them, so there was no need.
You don't have to convince me.
What's your favorite Elvis song?
I'm not sure. Maybe Little Sister. Or Marie!
