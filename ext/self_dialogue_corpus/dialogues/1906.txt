I am excited about the upcoming NFL season, are you?
Yes, pre-season starts in August!
The NFL season can't start soon enough for me!
I bet, since you got that super huge new TV to watch it on.
Yup, the Titans are going to look even better on it.
the Tennessee  Titans have had a few good years since getting that new quarterback.
Yes, Marcus Mariota was drafted back in 2015 and he is a good young quarterback.
Where was Marcus from?
Mariota played college ball with Oregon and had a great career there.
How did the Titans do with Marcus at the helm?
The Titans had a winning season with Marcus last year.
You think he will do even better this year and take them to the super bowl?
Hard to say how Marcus will do, he had a leg injury  at the end of last season.
Most quarterbacks in the NFL recover from leg injuries I think.
Your right, it is the shoulder and neck injuriest they have a hard time recovering from.
Is Marcus going to start this season for the Titans?
It looks like Marcus will be starting this season for the Titans
He has fully recovered from his leg injury then I would assume.
According to the latest news, Marcus has been cleared for full team drills so I think so.
I can't wiat for another exciting year of NFL football!
