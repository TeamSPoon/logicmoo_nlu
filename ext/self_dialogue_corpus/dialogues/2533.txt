Not a Ravens fan at all but they got a real good one in Baldwin.
I'm mad the Browns didn't get him.
He's a worker and was trained by the best.
I think he could fight his way on the field like Norwell last year for Carolina.
How did Michael Bennet fall so far in the draft?
I think it was a combination of his weight and lingering injury concerns. If a guy slips 10 spots in the first round you can chalk it up to some teams being dumb or missing out.
But all the teams passed up on him...
Then we have to take our homer glasses off and accept the possibility that they all saw something they didn't like.
Just goes to show you, even guys who truly believe they are not homers.
I try not to be blinded by the homer glasses.
I don't think it was homerism; these things happen sometimes.
Simply not a lot of need for the position.
Bennett will get his chance to shine for the Jags.
I guess his ability to embarrass offensive guards with his speed wasn't replicable in this draft.
C'mon man, that's the kind of homer talk we were just discussing.
Can't help it...
You also have to consider that Bennett had a hamstring problem that teams got to evaluate the combine.
And after all those teams pass, the players show up and end up starting
He wasn't flashy, but he put tailbacks on their butts behind the line of scrimmage with regularity last season.
I will say he was where he was supposed to be a lot of times. And that is all that counts
