What is your favorite movie?
That is a loaded question. You need to be more specific.
What is your favorite comedy?
I love the movie Airplane.
Good choice. Me too!
What about you?
I really love Caddyshack
Totally. Bill Murray is great in that.
He is excellent in everything he does.
Yes, that man is a national treasure.
What about action movies?
I love Diehard
It's great. But it is too violent for me.
I think you're crazy. That movie isn't that bad in terms of violence.
Maybe you're right. I'm just sensitive to those things.
What is your favorite action movie then?
Maybe a movie like The Patriot
That also has violence.
Yeah, maybe I'm a hypocrite.
At least we both like Mel Gibson movies.
