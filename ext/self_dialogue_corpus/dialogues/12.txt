What do you think of the Black Panther movie?
Personally, I think it is not going to be well received.
What makes you say that?
Look at where is takes place and look at all of the black people in it.
I never thought about it that way.
I think it is a good movie but I know some will make a big deal about it not having enough diversity in it.
I think Chris Boseman does an excellent job of portraying Black Panther.
I liked Sterling K. Brown's acting in the movie.
Yeah, so did I.
He has some real acting skills.
