Are you a big football fan?
I used to watch when I was younger but not anymore.
Who was your team when you used to watch?
I was a diehard Cowboys fan my whole life and still am even though I don't really watch it.
I grew up in Vikings territory so I'm a Vikings fan.
Oh man I am a Viking hater.
Really, how come?
I just got sick of everyone liking them because they are the local team even though they don't like football.
So kind of like how you like the Cowboys even though you don't watch football.
Not really, I used to like football and watch it every week and I just stuck with my team.
That makes sense I guess. Why don't you watch anymore?
When I watched I got really into it and it took up all of my time and I just needed a break.
So do you still watch occasionally then?
Once in a while I will watch a game, like on Thanksgiving or if I'm with friends who are watching.
Yeah it is always fun to go to the bar and watch with friends.
I don't drink anymore so I don't go to the bar and watch football. If I am going to watch it will be at a house.
Well we watch at my place every Sunday if you want to stop by you sure can.
I might have to come over and watch the Cowboys beat the Vikings.
Oh that will never happen.
We may have to make a friendly wager on it then.
