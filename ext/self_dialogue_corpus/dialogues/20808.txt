What's the best movie you have seen recently?
It's been a while since I've been to the movies, but I would say Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them?
I haven't heard of that.
It is the Harry Potter spin-off.
Oh, I have heard of that.  Based on the book by J.K. Rowling, right?
Exactly.
Is it like Harry Potter?
Actually, not really.  There is some overlap, but the time period is much different.
I love Eddie Redmayne.  I heard he was in that movie.
He is.  He plays the main character.
Is there anybody else in the movie I might know?
Johnny Depp has a small part.  Colin Farrell is in it as well.
I didn't really love the Harry Potter movies.  Do you think I would like it?
What didn't you like about the Harry Potter movies?
They just seemed to unrealistic.
Well, there is obviously magic in Fantastic Beasts.  So, I'm not sure.
I'll probably skip it then.
Well, I loved it.
Is there anything else I might like about it?
If you like clothing and time period movies, you might like how they recreated the 1920's.
