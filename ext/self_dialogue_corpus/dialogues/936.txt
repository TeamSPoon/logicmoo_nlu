When was the last time fair catch kick resulted in a score in an NFL game, I wonder...
Huh. that's a great question.. I have no idea. If ever, for that matter...
I'm gonna go look.
Me too. Google it.
No I'm gonna wiki it.
Google will give you the wiki link.
So why not just go directly to wiki?
Whatever, Ok The last time a successful fair catch kick led to a score is... 1976!!!
Bills and Chargers game.
They did try it a bunch of more times though.
The latest being the 49ers and Rams game.
Yeah. Phil Dawson missed it.
I remember that game. it sucked.
No games ever suck.
Some games suck.
Only if you let it.
See fair catch kick is dangerous though. you know why?
Oh here we go. Tell me why
Because if it comes short, the ball is still live and the opposing team can return it.
Haha, yeah like bama and auburn game from a few years back.
