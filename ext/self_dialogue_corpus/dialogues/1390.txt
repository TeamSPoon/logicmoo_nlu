Who do you think is the best running back ever?
Gayle Sayers.
Why?
His peers reported that he was the most difficult to tackle.
Yes, but he did that through agility.
Is there another way?
Yes, you can do it through strength.
Give me an example.
Beast Mode.
Who is Beast Mode?
Marshawn Lynch!
What makes him so great?
He's impossible to bring down.
Why?
He just refuses to go down. He drags people with him.
Wow, that sounds amazing!
He's scary. And, the great thing is that he's back.
What do you mean?
He just came out of retirement to play for the Raiders.
Sounds like a good match. I can't wait to see him this fall!
