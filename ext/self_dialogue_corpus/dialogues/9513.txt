I have so many favorite rap albums.
Can you narrow it down to a list, maybe?
I'm not sure. I don't think i can even pick just one to be honest.
Pick one that you like and tell me about it.
Alright then. I really loved Biggie's "Life After Death".
That's a very solid choice.
I just don't think that any album can touch it.
I mean, "Ready to Die" was a classic.
Oh, I forgot about that album.
That's an album that no one should forget.
