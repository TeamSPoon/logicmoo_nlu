I am so ready for NFL to start back up.
Me too!
Who is your team?
I like the New Orlean Saints.
Oh no!
What's wrong?
I am an Atlanta Falcons fan.
Oh, that's not cool.
Yeah, I can't handle the Saints.
Uh, I can't handle the Falcons.
Maybe we should talk about something besides football?
Nah, we can keep it civil.
I think so too.
You do know that we going to have a team this year. Like a good one.
You do know we are going after that ring this year?
Yeah, how did that work out for you last year?
Well, there was only one other team there, and it wasn't your guys.
It didn't look like yours showed up either.
I will give you that. It was ugly.
Yep.
