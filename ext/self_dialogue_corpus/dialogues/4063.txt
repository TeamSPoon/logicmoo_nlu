Rosemary's Baby is one of my favorite thrillers.
Really? Why's that?
There aren't any real "jump scares."
So it's not scary?
It is, but because everything that is normal in Rosemary's world slowly becomes strange an ominous.
Like her life has never been normal?
Yeah, it's scary to think of it happening to me.
Do you get to see the baby?
Not really; they more describe it than show it.
That sounds scarier.
