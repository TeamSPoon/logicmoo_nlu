Have you seen that kid Sindergaard pitch for the Mets?
Yeah, his hair is longer than his arms.
I don't like how the bullpen is performing.
They're giving up too many leads.
I don't think we're getting enough production out of second base.
We haven't had a good second basement in years.
I can't believe they offered him a five year contract.
I know, he hasn't hit over .300 since 2013.
That guy has a great curveball.
All of his pitches have a lot of movement.
That guy behind the plate calls a good game
He seems to have a good relationship with the pitching staff.
I don't think they're going to win 80 games this year.
If they're lucky, they'll win 70.
Who do you think the opening day starter should be?
I heard they're going to let Johnson do it, because he's the only veteran.
Who is the best manager of all time?
I would probably say Lou Piniella.
Who is the greatest hitter you've ever seen in person?
I think George Brett is. He could spray the ball all over the park.
