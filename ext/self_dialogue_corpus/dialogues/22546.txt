I love the movie THE GOONIES.
The monster was scary.
But he was their friend.
Yes, he helped them a lot.
I think his name was Sloth.
Chuck was funny.
Chuck was chubby and always hungry.
Josh Bolin was cute.
The cave was crazy.
And there was that organ.
They had to play that song.
Or else the floor would fall away.
Harvey Bernhard produced it.
The screen play was by Chris Columbus.
The kids lived in Goon Docks.
I guess that was the name of the town.
It was the name of their neighborhood.
It was in Oregon.
Yes, in Astoria.
I loved that movie.
