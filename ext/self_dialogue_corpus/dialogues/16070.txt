Man i want to make a new type of music
Why do you want to do that
To become someone important in the music scene
What does that have to do with another
Well if i invent something ill be revered
But has every genre not been made
Nah i am sure new sounds can always be made
But their has to be a limit
I am sure if their is we are from that
But why so certain
Because i am certain
Well you sound like it
I just think it would be cool
I mean i guess it would be cool
Exactly
But how are you gonna make new music
Just experiment
Good luck then
Thanks man
Your welcome
