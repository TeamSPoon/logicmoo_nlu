What did you think of Lady Gaga's last album?
I thought it was very different than her previous work.
Well that's pretty vague. Was it different in a good way or a bad way?
I like that she is not afraid to branch out and try something new, but I don't like her as a country artist.
I agree. I think she has a fantastic voice though.
She's a great singer, but I don't think her voice works for country music.
She's really good at jazz though. Her duet album with Tony Bennett was something different and it was pretty good.
What was your favorite song on that album?
I really liked Cheek to Cheek. How about you?
I think Lush Life was the best song. I'm not big on jazz, but that song is very moving.
