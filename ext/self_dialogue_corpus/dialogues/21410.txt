Hey i need to ask you some questions
Sure go ahead
Like this is serious
How serious
Very
Go ahead then
Who is your least favorite director
Are you serious
Yes it is very serous
Ok well jeeze i guess james cameron
Good you passed he is indeed very overrated
I do not like him
Why do you dislike him
His style is just bland
That is something i can agree
Well overall  it just puts me to sleep
Their is no substance
It is all flash and showy
Precisely
I hate  that type of directing.
