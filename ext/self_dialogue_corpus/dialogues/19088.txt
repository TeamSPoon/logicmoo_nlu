Lately I've wanted to start learning to play the theremin.
What's a theremin?
It's a kind of musical instrument invented by a Russian scientist in the twenties. It makes a very strange, electronic sound.
Why would you want to learn to play one then?
It just seems like it could be something unique.
Have I ever heard a theremin before?
Probably! The Beach Boys song Good Vibrations has a theremin in it!
Hmm, okay, I might try listening to it again. Does it show up anywhere else?
It's in the Led Zeppelin songs Whole Lotta Love and No Quarter. Apparently they played a loop during live performances.
That's really interesting! I don't know what to expect from this instrument now.
It sounds very out of this world to me.
I like songs that sound that way.
Me too. So long as they aren't just, like, noise.
Yeah. The Oasis song "Falling Down" does that for me.
I haven't heard that. Should I listen?
I think you might like it. It sounds like it's not as strange as a theremin though.
Nothing's as strange as a theremin.
Should I loan you a copy?
Please!
I'll go find it.
