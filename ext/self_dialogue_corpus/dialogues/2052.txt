Most overrated team in the NFL? Go.
Gotta be the Cowboys.
Why do you say that?
Zeke and Dak were good last year but rookies sometime take backward steps.
That's true, but their offensive line is deadly.
Deadly, yes, but getting old.
True, me personally, I think the Falcons are due for a step back.
Why do you say that?
That rough Super Bowl loss will be tough to get over.
True, they may play tense.
Yep, and when you're tense, you make mistakes.
That's very true, but they are still talented.
Talented, yes, but, they may be soft.
Come on, don't discount them that much.
Just saying, it's a tough loss to get over.
Yeah, but what about the Patriots?
What about them?
Don't you think they may also regress after the emotional high.
Brady is such a stoic, I don't think it'll affect him.
Yes, but maybe Father Time will...
