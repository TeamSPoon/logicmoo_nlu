Who do you think will draft Lonzo Ball.
I think he ends up a Laker.
Oh really. How would that happen.
Lakers make some trades to get him.
It would be amazing to seem him stay in SoCal, but can you really build a team around h im.
I think so. He is going to be an All Star.
Well, Lakers need some hope. What a mess.
Yeah, they're my favorite team and it's sad to see how bad they are.
Who do you think makes the biggest improvement next season?
I'm thinking Wizards.
Did you get out to any games this year.
Only a couple. Ticket prices along with parking are really a lot of money
A friend gave me tickets to a Bulls game.
That sounds like fun. I've never been to Chicago.
Do you think Porzingas stays in New York.
I think he's basically running the team now with Anthony out of the way.
Who do you think was MVP this year.
That's a hard one.  Westbrook was amazing.
I hope they focus more on basketball this year and less on politics.
Yeah, pretty sick of all of the political crap.
