You ever watch the First Hulk Movie from the early 2000's.
Yeah the one with the different actor as hulk?
That's the one.
I liked him better than the one that plays in the Avengers.
Me too not sure why they changed it.
Why do you ask?
What did you think of the story of hulk?
I think it's much deeper and beautiful than people think.
How so?
Well he's a terrified man who loses control and then doesn't want to do any harm but he is hunted like an animal and provoked so he retaliates.
That's a fair point.
I think he's like a big teddy bear that's just different in every way you can think of.
Sadly people don't like change.
I love how the girl isn't afraid.
It's a classic love story but more action oriented.
I couldn't have said it better.
Do you think there will be more Hulk movies?
Probably not any movies with just Hulk but more Avengers for sure.
That's unfortunate but understood.
Yeah sadly I don't think the movies were that well liked.
