Hey, I am looking for some good romantic comedies to watch. Do you happen to know of any?
Well, do you have any favorite actors or actresses?
I love Ryan Reynolds as far as actors. I like quite a few actresses, but I really like Sandra Bullock.
Well then I have the perfect movie for you.
What is that?
The Proposal. It is so funny!
Is it a super mushy movie? It sounds like it with a name like that.
No, really through most of the movie they cannot stand one another.
Sounds interesting. I really like Sandra Bullock movies.
What is your favorite?
I have to go with the classic-While You Were Sleeping.
Oh I love that one too! I like a lot of the older romantic comedies.
Which one is your all-time favorite?
Oh tough choice! I would have to go with either Sleepless in Seattle or You've Got Mail.
Oh my goodness. Those are such good movies!
What about you?
I don't know if it really fits the bill exactly, but have always loved Grease.
Who doesn't love Grease! I would say that it most definitely fits the bill of romantic comedy.
John Travolta has changed so much since then though.
I know, I really miss his older movies.
