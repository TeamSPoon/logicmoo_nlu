So, have you seen the movie The Boondock Saints?
OMG! I LOVE that movie!
I do as well, i own that and Boondock Saints II.
So do i, that's amazing!
What do you like about the movie?
Oh, because the filming is like a cross between DePalma and Tarrentino.
Funny, i thought almost the same thing, when the scenes overlapped each other.
I agree, it was so well put togehter.
Which was your favorite character?
Oh, geez... that's a hard question.
It is. It was an outstanding ensemble cast.
I would have to say Smeckler. Dafoe stole most of the movie.
Oh easily. The way he just made the Boston Police Detectives look clueless was fantastic.
I cracked up when he'd stick it to Greenly.
Short of the brothers, i would have to say Rocco was a show stealer as well.
Oh, when he had to tell Carlo Rota a joke and he was stammering thru it, outrageous!
Was that the actors name, Carlo Rota?
Yes, he's been in a ton of movies and TV series.
Anything i may have seen?
Probably, he was in both Nikita TV shows and in the movie Mission to Mars.
