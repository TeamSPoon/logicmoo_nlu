Do you dislike anything about the Star Wars films?
I didn't like Duku as a character
What did you dislike about him?
I didn't understand why he turned to the dark side
His story left plenty of open ends
I didn't really understand the point of the droid army
It was supposed to have been a war fabricated by Sidious
The motives for the Trade Federation was a little unclear
They might just have been a large security force
That would be something a new army would go against
