Hey did you see Jason Bourne that came out 2016?
No i didn't but I heard it did 415 million
It was the #1 movie. I think I want to watch it tonight.
Bourne Identity was good so You should be safe on this one.
You know how many times something will be touted to be so great and then in your opinion it just left you lacking?
Ye but I think we do that to ourselves by putting too much credibility on the hype surrounding the movie.
That could be so but it always go the other way.
I have had that happen too. When some one tells you a movie is really bad and then you wind up liking it.
I think I am going to give it a try.
Let me know your opinion on how it measured up to your expectations.
