What are your feelings about Meatloaf?
I love meatloaf. Just make sure to let it rest for ten minutes before you cut it or it'll fall apart.
No... the band.
I know, I'm totally kidding.
One thing I love about them is that it proves ugly people can be successful in music.
That's kind of rude.
Well, think about it. He's ugly. Find me another ugly celebrity who isn't typecast.
A lot of drummers are ugly.
Okay, a singer who is the frontperson of their band. Ugly. Go.
Fine, you win.
Now, what do you think about their music?
I only know a handful of their songs, but I like what I hear.
I like that they are kind of the Netflix of music.
How so?
Netflix has allowed shows to tell a story in as much or as little time as needed, rather than the typical length.
So?
Some of their songs are well over the typical three-to-five minute radio song. They're extensive and allow for great storytelling.
Well, from what I remember, the lyrics are pretty repetitive.
"Paradise by the dashboard light" does spend like three minutes repeating the same lyrics, true.
But yeah, they're definitely fun to listen to.
