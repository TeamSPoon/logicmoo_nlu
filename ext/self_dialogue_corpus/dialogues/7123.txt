What was that movie that had monsters scaring kids for energy?
Monster's Inc.?
Oh yeah, that's it. I loved that movie.
It was a good movie. Sully was my favorite character.
I actually liked Mike the green one eyed ball.
Mike was very funny.
That little girl Boo was very cute and funny as well.
Yeah it was a good film. It had a good story.
I think they've made a couple sequels right?
I don't know, maybe one or two.
