Do you have any theories on who Supreme Leader Snoke actually is in the new 'Star Wars' trilogy?
I have no clue.  Weren't there rumors about it being Jar Jar Binks?
I think those were more jokes than actual rumors.
That's a relief to hear.  What are some of the main theories?
Well there is one that Snoke is actually Darth Plagueis.
Wasn't that the name of the Emperor's master, mentioned in the prequel series?
Yes it was.
But how would Darth Plagueis have survived if Palpatine said he was killed?
That's a good point.  It is just a rumor I heard.
Well, I like that rumor way more than the Jar Jar Binks one!
