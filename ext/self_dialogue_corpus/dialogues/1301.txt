Hey Phil you been keeping up with NFL lately?
Yeah I've been reading some articles on the draft and some trades, looks like there will be some stacked teams next year.
I know for sure the Steelers have a great squad, and they will be a threat.
I like the Steelers luckily, you a fan of Big Ben?
Are you talking Roethlisberger?
Most definitely man!
Oh yeah I am a huge fan, maybe the best quarterback the Steelers ever had!
He is damn good but don't forget about my buddy Terry Bradshaw.
Terry was a damn beast, definitely clutch in the most important games.
I met Terry as a kid actually, tremendously nice guy!
That is so cool to hear, where did you meet?
I was a kid actor and did some side work, he had a show called 'Home Team' and I was a guest.
That is amazing dude, Terry is the man!
It was a great experience, I've met a few football players actually, all really nice!
Who else did you meet?
One time I actually met Jerry Rice and told him he was the fastest man I'd ever seen catch a ball!
Maybe hyperbole but it made sense at the time I am sure.
Of course, any player you meet becomes the best player ever!
I definitely need to go to a game and meet one of these juggernauts.
Let's get some tickets and take a road trip, maybe Arizona and the Cardinals first game back!
