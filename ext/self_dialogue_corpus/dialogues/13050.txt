What was your favorite part of The Force Awakens?
I love it when Han Solo and Chewbaka show up. I saw A New Hope decades ago when I was a kid, and seeing them again in a Star Wars film brought up great memories.
Yeah, that was great. But then it must have been quite a shock when Solo gets it.
It sure was. I didn't hear any spoilers and didn't see it coming. I couldn't believe it.
Rey is a great new heroine though, and a great Jedi trainee.
Yes, her character was handled well. Other than seeing Solo and Chewbaka, my favorite part was when she finds Luke Skywalker and delivers his light saber.
Right, he's only in the film for a few seconds but his presence has a terrific impact.
That's for sure. And Mark Hamill is excellent. He fits right into the role as if he's never left.
I agree. There's a lot to look forward to in the sequel.
I can hardly wait.
