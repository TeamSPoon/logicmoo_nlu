What is your favorite kind of music?
I kind of like everything. Well, except heavy metal and most rap I guess.
You even like country music?
Yes, I love country. Although I prefer the traditional country music to today's pop country.
So people like Patsy Cline and Waylon Jennings?
Exactly! As for newer artists, I just think Sam Hunt incorporating rap into country is awful.
So you probably don't like Keith Urban and Carrie Underwood's new song then?
Well, I don't mind the song on its face; however, in my opinion it is not country at all.
I can understand that. It has a lot of synthesized music.
I know. It seems like it would work better in the pop genre.
It reminds me more of something you'd here from Lady Gaga, not a country artist.
I don't know if I'd go that far, but I see where you are coming from. I do like Lady Gaga though.
Me too. She is such a great singer. Interesting though that you like old country and Lady Gaga.
Well that doesn't even cover my favorite: Bruce Springsteen.
You really do like a lot of genres don't you.
Yes, for sure. Are you a Bruce fan?
Casually, but I wouldn't say a hard core fan.
I'm not as crazy as some, but I've seen him seven times.
Wow. You really do like him.
I just can't get enough of his classic rock.
