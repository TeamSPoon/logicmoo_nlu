Did you like Anakin Skywalker's turn in Revenge of the Sith?
Yeah I mean we knew it was coming.
Excellent, I believe the same.
I think it was the best out of all the Star Wars so far.
I didnt think that far into it.
Samuel L Jackson had a campy role though
Most actors who arent into it have minor roles.
I didnt like his at all.
James Earl Jones did a great job with Vader
That is off topic, but I agree with you
