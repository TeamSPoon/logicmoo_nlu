The only one of the prequel Star Wars movies I really like is Revenge of the Sith.
Is that the third one?
Yeah. It's the climax of the prequels.
Why do you like that one? I never even got around to seeing it.
Well, I can understand that. The second one is very bad.
It's just so slow, and the twists come out of nowhere.
The first one, too, felt a bit unnecessary. And the explanation for what the force is doesn't help.
Yeah, that was rough. It made it feel less mystical.
The third one, though, it helps you understand who Anakin is. And he's really the protagonist of the series.
I've never thought of it that way.
