Recently, I have been wondering if all the Beatles had survived, would they still be producing music today?
Good question. With the success off Paul McCartney, it is a good bet to think that they would have.
Do you think the group would have remained intact?
I doubt that they would have all the time, but possibly they would have come together for "reunion" tours.
That would have been something to see -- a reunion tour!  I wonder if they would have kept their original sound?
I think they would have.  I would be great to hear them together again live.
There are some imitation Beatles groups out there that do a good job imitating them.
I have seen Tribute 1964 where they sing their early songs. They open with "I Wanna Hold Your Hand" and it sounds pretty good.
I have seen that group too.  They even have the Beatles mannerisms down fairly well. "Ringo" bops his head to the music; "John" plays the harmonica.
And, "Paul" even plays a left-handed base guitar!
