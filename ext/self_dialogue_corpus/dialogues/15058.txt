What is your favorite comedy?
Any movie with Adam Sandler. He's hilarious!
He is great! I loved him in Billy Madison!
That movie is hilarious! Have you seen Grown Ups?
I have seen the first one, how is the second?
It's the BEST! Kevin James and David Spade are hilarious, too.
Grown Ups 1 was funny. Chris Rock cracks me up.
I like the burp snart's that Kevin James does.
Haha yes. Totally funny.
Have you seen Mall Cop with Kevin James?
