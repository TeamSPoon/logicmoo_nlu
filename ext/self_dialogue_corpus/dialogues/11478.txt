Do you think paul McCartney and ringo Starr will ever tour together?
I don't know but I hope so
That would be cool
It would but I know paul has said in the past that it would be tough
It would because they both stay really busy
They do stay busy.
I believe they both are working on new albums.
I heard that too.
I heard paul,already recorded something on ringos upcoming album
I saw that in Rolling Stone
