DO you like the NFL?
Sure I do
Whats your favorite team
The Cowboys
The Dallas Cowboys are an excellent team. I love them. But how do you like the Steelers?
I feel that team is very weak now
For real? How come
I dont like the quarterback and their defense is lacking
So you think they need someone like Manning
Sure, thats exactly what they need
Im with you on that one
Your welcome
But what about the Patriots and Tom Brady, do you like them as well
No. I dont like them at all
Why?
Because of their huge ego
I see. I see.
I guess they are more than meets the eye, but its a truly hard situation for all of them
You feel its a loopsided team ha?
Yeah, Brady hover atop all of them.
