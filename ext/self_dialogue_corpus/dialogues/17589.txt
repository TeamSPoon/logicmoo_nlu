Did you ever listen to The Doors music?
Some of it.
Do you remember the song Light my Fire?
Yes I do, when did they make music?
I think back in the 60's.
Was it really that long ago?
Yes, we're some oldies now.
Yes we are.
How about Riders of the storm?
Yes when was that released?
1971 I believe.
It has been a long time.
I miss the old music.
Me too, they don't make it like that anymore.
Did you like their song People Are Strange?
I don't recall that one.
It was a little unknown.
Is it one of your favorites?
It's one i've listened to the most I think.
That's awesome.
