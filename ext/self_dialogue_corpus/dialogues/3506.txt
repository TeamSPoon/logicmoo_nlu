So, do you think of a lot of the modern horror films coming out?
I don't know, I don't really care for too many of them.
Why not?
Seems like most of them these days are just pointless jump scares.  to me, jump scares are NOT horror, it's just a cheap trick anyone can do.
Ahhh... like Paranormal Activity.
Yeah, exactly... and what tare they up to on those now, like fifty or something?
Well, what I don't are all these remakes of GOOD horror films.
Oh, tell me about.. like The Thing?  What the hell?  All that crappy CGI.
Actually, I think that was supposed to be a prequel to the original.
Well, either way, it sucked.
