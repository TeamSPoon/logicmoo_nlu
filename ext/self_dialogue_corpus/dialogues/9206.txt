What's your favorite thing about rock music?
For me, it's always been the guitar.
Do you play?
Yes. I've been playing guitar for a few years now, and mostly play rock.
That's great. Do you have any influences?
Well, I really don't make my own stuff yet.
Oh. Do you at least have any favorites?
If I had to pick some, it would be Jimmy Page and Jimi Hendrix.
Excellent choices. Hendrix especially.
I know. He's a legend.
