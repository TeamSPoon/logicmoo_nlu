Who do you think is the funniest Star Wars character?
C-3PO
I like him too. R2-D2 is funny as well.
Their relationship is so sweet.
Yes. It gets built really well in the original movie.
Did you like the scene where they are lost in the desert?
Yes. That is one of my favorites.
Did you like them in the newest movie?
Not really. They did not do much.
Yes. They were sort of stagnant.
