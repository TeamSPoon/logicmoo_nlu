Do you like that fast and the furious movies?
Not really.
Oh how come?
I just thought it was too predictable for a action movie.
Oh like what do you mean?
Like the explosions and the women crowding around races.
Does that not happen in real life?
Not that I know of.
Oh I had no idea.
Yea. I just didnt like them.
