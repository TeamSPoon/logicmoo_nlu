Did you see that the new Fleet Foxes album came out a few days ago?
What's it called, "Fool's Errand"?
Nah, that's actually just a song on the record. It's called "Crack-Up."
So, what are your thoughts on the album? What's different?
Well, it's still very quintessentially Fleet Foxes. You wouldn't mistake it for anyone else.
Does that mean they've grown? Or "Helplessness Blues" all over again?
To me, it's an even more ambitious project, trying for more emotional range. You get it all here.
Is it electronic-y or all hushed folk music?
See, that's the thing. They're trying to combine it all. I'd say it mostly works.
...but doesn't all the time.
Yeah. Like the title track, for instance. It starts with this super mumbling choir sound. Then peaks into full on Fleet Foxes.
And you think it's a little jarring? I read that in a review, too.
Wait, was that in Prefix Magazine? I read that too.
It was. The author compared the quieter moments in the song to "deep ruts in an otherwise flat country road."
That's a totally fitting analogy. There's all these moments that are just like, "huh, that's a curious artistic choice."
What do you think is the strongest song on the album?
I'd say "Kept Woman." It's classic Fleet Foxes with really floaty, poetic lyrics.
The kind of song to start a Sunday morning?
Spot on. Or the last thing you hear on a Friday night.
Pull up Spotify! Let's give the album a spin.
