Like Ben and Arthur or The Room.

Yeah, I like bad movies, but only when they are unintentionally bad.
Well do you like anything good?
I like a couple yeah, but I'm more into TV.
How come?
I find movies really difficult to sit through.
Do you have any favorite actors or actresses?
Dick Van Dyke is my favorite actor. Janet Jackson is my favorite actress.

Not many, but she was great in all of them.
