Did you think that Mary Jane and Peter would have gotten married?
I would like to have seen a fourth movie, apart from the remakes
It's odd how much better the first of anything seems to be
All of the characters in that movie had some big losses
Yes, they only had so many to work with after they killed some off
I felt like Mary Jane was out of Peter's league, but by the end Peter was out of hers
She made it to broadway, but then went back to singing at a bar
The bar scene when he pushes her is cool
I wish they had not had them dancing at the end
That made it seem like it's okay to push women
