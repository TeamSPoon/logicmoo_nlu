What's your favorite western movie ever?
That's almost too tough to choose.
Alright, I'll start.  I'll say Unforgiven.
Pretty darn good choice.  I prefer the classics a bit more.
And what classic would that be?
The Searchers.
Hey, that's an admirable choice.  The ending scene is iconic.
You mean the doorway scene?
Right.  He kind of stands there, doesn't know what to do, and then walks away.
It was a brilliant framing device for his overall character.
The reason I like Unforgiven is just how non-Hollywood it is.
You mean how Clint Eastwood is an anti-hero?
Right.  William Munny is not a good man, but a man who operates out of necessity.
Very film school like of you to think of it in that manner.
That's not to say he doesn't have a heart, but he's also ruthless.
He apparently has killed women and children, at least that's alluded to.
Yeah, but the whole point is that you can't outrun your past.
And that past comes up to meet him at the end.
Like I said, just a phenomenal movie.
No doubt, so many great westerns!
