What Disney movies have female lead characters?
There's for sure a bunch. The Little Mermaid, Pocahontas,  Frozen, Inside Out.
Wow, I hadn't realized ther ewere so many.
Yeah, they do a pretty decent job at balancing things.
That's good, I think it's important for girls to have role models.
Yeah, I think that Riley from Inside out is a great role model.
Why?
She has such a health relationship to her emotions.
I see what you're saying. She experiences them all in a way that's balanced.
Exactly.
