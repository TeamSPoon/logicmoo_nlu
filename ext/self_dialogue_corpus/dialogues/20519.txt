What is your favorite movie of all time?
Well, that is a difficult question to answer, but if you insist then I might say Clint Eastwood's Unforgiven.
What do you like about that movie?
I like the juxtaposition of a good guy (Clint) doing bad things for a good cause, or for multiple good causes?
What do you mean 'multiple good causes?'
Well, Clint was a bounty hunter, who typically killed people who needed killing. And he did so in order to support his family.
So what was bad about what he did?
Well, as he might say, there ain't nothing like killing a man. In one line he says he's killed men, women, children, and just about anything that walks or crawls.
Is there a lot of violence in that movie?
The violence is limited to typical gunfights and shootouts. There is some blood but almost no gore.
Besides Clint Eastwood, are there any other notable actors or actresses in Unforgiven?
Yes there are. At least two other famous actors are in the movie, but their names escape me at the moment.
What else do you like about Unforgiven?
I really like the comedic elements in the movie. There are comedic elements woven throughout the movie.
Which comedic elements do you best recall?
Well, I remember a kid coming to Clint and asking to be his assassination partner, except that this kid has horrible eyesight, which is important for a gunfighter.
That sounds funny.
Yes, it is also funny when the kid tries to brag about how many people he's 'kilt' and Clint basically laughs at him.
Are there other funny parts?
There are few moments when the topic of sex is brought up and the dialogue is quite funny.
