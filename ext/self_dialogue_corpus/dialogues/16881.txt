Did you ever see The Beatles live?
No
Were you alive then?
No
That makes sense then. Everyone saw them
Did they play at Shea Stadium?
Yes
All the women went crazy
Yes. The girls loved them
I think that might be the reason they went to being studio musicians.
I agree.
I loved their studio stuff better.
Me too
They got very artistic
Yeah. Sgt Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band was amazing
That had classic song after classic song.
I loved Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds
That is one of the best on the album
True. I like When I'm Sixty Four
That one is so catchy
