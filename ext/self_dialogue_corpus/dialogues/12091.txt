I love the gender equality that the Star Wars movies promote.
Exactly, Leia gets a turn at being a heroine alongside Luke and Han Solo.
Then in the Phantom Menace, Attack of the Clones, and The Revenge of the Sith, Padme is a female driving force.
Padme is a force to be reckoned with!
Agreed. And I loved Natalie Portman cast in that role.
She did a great job.
I look forward to the new Star Wars movie coming out in December 2017.
I'm sure there will be some powerful female characters that are featured.
I know Rey will resume her role and portray a strong female character.
As only George Lucas can do it!
