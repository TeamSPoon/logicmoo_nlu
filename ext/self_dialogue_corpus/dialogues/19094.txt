Do you enjoy top 40 at all?
That really depends. Sometimes there are great songs on there.
Right. But I feel like most of the time it's the most shallow music that get's on the top 40.
I totally agree. I will say though- even though most of the songs on there aren't my taste, there's some impressive stuff to hear.
Like what?
Well for starters, today's upper level of popstars are incredibly talented. Like Bruno Mars has an incredible voice, and he's a great dancer too.
But do you actually enjoy his music though?
Not really. But Uptown Funk was decent.
Yeah, it was fine. I got tired of it really quickly though.
Same.  What else do you like about Pop radio?
The other thing is more interesting I think. When you listen to top 40 songs, you hear some of the absolute greatest production around today.
Oh, absolutely. Like I would never go out of my way to listen to pop songs, but when I do for whatever reason, the production always stands out to me.
Yep. So that's been good sometimes. Like once, the only station I could find was top 40.
Yikes. But the production was entertaining on its on?
Exactly. The I could enjoy just picking out the different instruments and listening to them individually.
That's interesting. I'll have to try that next time. What song stood out to you recently?
Well it wasn't super recent, but "Roar" by Katy Perry sounds phenomenal.
I'll give it a listen again. This time focusing on the production quality.
Cool, I think you'll be surprised how enjoyable it is.
We'll see. Thanks for the suggestion!
