Do you remember the pop music that we would listen to growing up in the '90s?
Are you seriously asking if I remember '90s pop? How could I possibly forget the era of boy bands?
Who did you like more: Backstreet Boys or N*SYNC?
I have to say N*SYNC most definitely. Did you know they were my very first concert?
How cool! I would love to see them perform live!
What is your favorite song by them?
Its so hard to pick just one, but "Its Gonna Be Me" is up there in my top favorites, along with "This I Promise You".
"This I Promise You" is SUCH a beautiful song!
Remember when Justin Timberlake still had the bleach blonde frosted curly hair? It was "Tearin' Up My Heart" when he said "Bye, Bye, Bye" to the curls and shaved his head!
I was so sad when I saw that his curly hair was "Gone", I just kept thinking "I Want You Back".
