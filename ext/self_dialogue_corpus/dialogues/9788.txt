So do you think Ice Cube and Ice T are sellouts?
Nah, just because they like money and acting doesn't make them sellouts.
I suppose you're right, if their acting careers totally sucked they'd be sellouts I suppose.
Of course I'm right.
All right, if they're not sellouts who is?
That's easy, Flavor Flave.
Oh wow you're right, between the roast and Flavor of Love it doesn't get much worse than that.
Again, of course I'm right.
He may have been a sellout, but he is still a living legend.
Yeah, you can't argue that.
