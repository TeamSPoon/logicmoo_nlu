Do you like to watch Disney moves?
Of course, they are some of the best movies out there!
Are you familiar with The Incredibles?
Yes, I watched the first one and it was great.  My kids loved it!
Have you heard about the sequel?
No, are they making a part 2?
Yes, but it's coming out in 2019.
That's so far away!
Yeah, it's a long ways away but at least the kids have something to look forward to.
This is true, my kids will be pleased.
