What Star Wars movies do you think are the best not counting the first three that came out in the series?
Of the newer movies made in 1999 to present you mean?
Yes, not those in the original trilogy.
I thought Episode III: Return of the Sith was the best one.
It did have the best story line.
And it really put together in understanding a lot in the original trilogy.
Like where Darth Vadar came from.
And why he was in that black suit.
I liked The Force Awakens as well.
I think that one is up there too in the newer movies I like the new characters.
