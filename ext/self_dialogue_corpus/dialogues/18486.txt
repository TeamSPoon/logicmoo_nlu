Do you remember Green Day?
Of course! They're a great group.
I'm trying to remember if they won any big awards.
Yes, for sure. Boulevard of Broken Dreams.
Oh yeah, that's right. Around 2006, no?
Yes, that was a good year for music.
What else was nominated for a grammy back then?
U2 had an album. I don't remember the name of it though.
Oh, I remember. How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb.
That's it. Yeah, that was a pretty good one.
And then I remember Feel Good Inc by Gorillaz
Oh dear, way overplayed.
Yeah, I agree
I think John Legend was just starting out back then.
Oh really. It seems like he's been around a lot longer.
Yes, I agree.
Didn't Madonna also have an album that year?
Yes, Hung Up
That's right. Pretty catchy tunes on that one.
Yeah, I wasn't a big fan though
