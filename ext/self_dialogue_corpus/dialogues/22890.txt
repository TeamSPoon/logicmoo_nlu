How dare you say the hateful 8 is his best movie?
I really thought it was!
Well your WRONG.
Samuel L Jackson did such a good job.
He may have but think about all the other movies he made!
I know in general people didnt like it the most but I did.
You are insane, next you will say that the new ghost buster movie is good.
It was excellent I loved it with Woman!
OH my god get out of here.
What?
The original was so much better.
but its all about feminism!
I know that why I hate it!
Well we are different people.
I did love hidden figures though.
Same I thought it was really interesting!
Do you remember any of the actress'?
There was that one from Grey's Anatomy!
OH she is a nobody
Yeah
