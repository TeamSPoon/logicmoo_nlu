What is your favorite Disney movie?
I would have to say that my favorite Disney movie is The Lion King.
I can admit that The Lion King is one of my favorites as well. What actors did the voices?
James Earl Jones, Matthew Broderick, and Whoopi Goldberg just to name a few.
I enjoyed the part when Simba connected with Timon and Pumbaa.
It was really sad when Scar killed his brother Mufasa.
Have you seen the The Lion King on Broadway?
No, I haven't had the opportunity to see it. I'm sure it's great.
We should purchase tickets to go see it!
That would be a great idea!
