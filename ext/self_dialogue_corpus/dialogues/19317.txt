Have you heard the new Lorde album?
No. Is it any good.
There are some cool tracks on it. I like Homemade Dynamite.
Ill check it out.
Its a bit more somber than her last album.
Cool. Is she touring now?
Im not sure. I saw her a few years ago and she was not too good live
How so?
She was a bit stiff. Just kinda stood there.
I heard that she uses backing tracks instead of live musicians.
She had a drummer and a keyboard player but there were tracks playing behind her.
Who else played the show.
Vampire Weekend.
I really cant stand them.
I like em.
They are a little goofy for my tastes.
I could see that. The drummer uses a cocktail drum kit which is a little weird.
I have never seen anyone use one that wasn't in a jazz band.
Its not too common
That is because it is a bit silly.
