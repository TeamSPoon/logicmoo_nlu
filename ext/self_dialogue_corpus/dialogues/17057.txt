Have you heard of people seeing musical notes as colors?
What?
Yeah. It's called Synesthesia.
That sounds weird.
Like less than 1% of the population is born with some of their senses intertwined.
Wow, I wish I had that.
I actually have a friend who, when he plays piano, just has a river of colors flowing in his brain.
You framed it like a disease at first, but now it sounds like a boon.
Oh totally. I'm sure Synesthesia makes you better at music.
That makes sense. It probably can only help.
There are also other forms of Synesthesia, like people smelling colors.
That one doesn't seem as useful.
What is the best chef in the world smells a rainbow of flavors.
Or the best food critic has a refined color wheel on his palette.
I see what you did there. Palette.
I kid I kid. Thanks for telling me about this.
Yeah no problem. I just thought it was interesting.
Yeah. Now I just wish I had it.
I do too. We're just going to have to imagine colors while we do things.
I'm thinking of rainbow!!
