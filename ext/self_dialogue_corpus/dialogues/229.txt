Did you see Deadpool?
No, I wanted to though.
It was really good.
Was it?  I think I would like it.
Yeah, it was pretty gory and the humor was off though.
Well, that's Deadpool for you.  You didn't bring the kids did you?
Oh, no.  That would've been bad for them.
Yeah, that's what I was thinking.
Yeah, you should rent it one night alone.
I'll do that.
