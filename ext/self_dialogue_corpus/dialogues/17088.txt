Do you think hip hop is dead?
Like now its rap?
Yeah I think its just barely viable in today's world.
The art of hip hop is just basically The Roots nowadays
I remember when A tribe called quest ran that game.
Yeah its really sad.
Who would you like as the best rapper?
Future
I Dont like the way he comes off
Hes really philanthropic as well
Yeah he does give back
I would say Kanye
Outside of Late Registration I dont know about that
I like his views
I think he should shut up about them
I dont think thats neccesarily the right viewpoint to be honest.
I wish rappers would just stop talking about topics related to things other than music
Thats the way music goes man
To be loud about stuff you dont know about?
No, but to use your pulpit for change
