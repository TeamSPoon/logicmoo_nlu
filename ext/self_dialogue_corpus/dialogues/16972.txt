I miss old R&B.
What do you mean by that?
Old stuff that was back in the 90s or even the 80s and 70s.
What's different about R&B now?
Right now it has no substance save a few people like Bruno Mars.
What kind of things did you want to hear in the music?
I think before it had a message and wasn't all about the beat and nonsensical words.
I see what you mean. A lot of music is kind of dumbed down for just being catchy.
Yeah! That's what I mean entirely. The temptations and others actually had something to talk about.
Oh wow so you're going back that far in time I see. I liked Teddy Pendergass too.
I agree! He was amazing and a lot of the music was about relationships back then.
I think some of that music was pretty powerful in a lot of was but sometimes sort of repetitive.
Repetitive? Compared to now?
Well if you compare it to now I suppose you have a point, but it was mostly relationships in the 80s.
That is true, but there was a ton of variety and there were more than single word lyrics per sentence.
Yeah I see what you mean there, but I do find some modern artists still do well
I think they do, but you have people like Beyonce who has good music but several writers.
Having a lot of writers is just a common thing now, but atleast the music is decent
Well I suppose thats true. Maybe one day creativity will take the front seat again.
Yeah I hope so too.
