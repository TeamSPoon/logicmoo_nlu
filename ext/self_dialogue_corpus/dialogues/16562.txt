Hey, have you heard anything good lately?
What do you mean?
I've been trying to find some good music.
What kind are you into?
Anything, really.
Well, you know I mostly like country and the like.
Well, any good songs your neck of the woods?
Haha, a few, yeah.
Like what?
Like Jon Pardi's 'Dirt on my Boots'.
That is the most country thing I've ever heard, haha!
It has a really good sound, though.
Maybe I'll give it a listen, then.
Alright. Anything you think I should listen to?
Hm, anything by Lorde should be up your alley.
Lorde? I haven't listened to her new ablum, is it good?
It really is, she's got a great voice.
Then I'll be listening to it.
Alright, later!
Later!
