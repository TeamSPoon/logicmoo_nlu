Do you think the NHL will contract a team?
I dont think so that would be terrible for the league.
I wouldnt understand how the players get disseminated.
Should put them all through free agency.
Yeah but what about the contracts?
Never thought about that.
I think Carolina may get moved.
No attendance there but the team has been trash.
Should never have moved from Hartford.
Just like the Jets should have never moved to Arizona.
Yeah, thats another team that should head North of the border.
I would be glad to see more Canadian teams. They deserve them.
With the way the sport is going in the NHL? Definitely!
But then you have the value of the American dollar.
True but I think the game needs more fans.
People in the states are becoming disinterested.
The finals doesnt even draw a ton of fans.
Its also during the summer so its tough to compete.
I dont think thats true, football could do it.
Well hockey cannot, its too niche
