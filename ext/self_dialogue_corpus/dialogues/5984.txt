I didn't know Disney did Pirates of the Caribbean.
I didn't know that either until recently.
They also did Guardians of the Galaxy. I love that one.
Have you seen part 2 yet?
Not yet but from what I hear it's even better than the first one.
That's gonna be hard to top but then again it is Disney.
That's true. Have you seen all the Pirate movies?
Only the first two but I love Captain Jack Sparrow.
Me too. Johnny Depp is hilarious in that role.
Kiera Knightley was good in those films as well as Orlando Bloom.
