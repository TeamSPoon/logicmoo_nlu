So, have you seen the movie The Aristocats?
Oh yeah, that's an awesome movie!  I love the cats in that one.
Yeah, they are precious.  Marie the little white one is so cute.
I know!  It has some really funny parts and songs, too.
Yeah, they definitely stick in your head.  I love cartoon movies about animals.
I do too!  The Rats of Nimh is another good one, have you seen it?
Yeah, it came out around the same time didn't it.
Yes, I believe so.  It's a great story about a bunch of mice that live in a field and has mystery and intrigue, too.
Yeah, I think it's based off a book isn't it?
I really don't know about that, but I know it's a great movie.
Did you ever see Charlotte's Web?
Oh yeah, that is a sad one.  It's not as good as the book but it is a great movie.
It has a good soundtrack, too.
Yes, it has some good sing a longs.
Wasn't the Aristocats a Disney movie?
I believe it was.  It was a lesser well-known one, but it was still great.
I wonder why it wasn't as popular as some of the others.
I don't know.  The story drags a little here and there, maybe that's why.
I didn't think that it dragged.
Yeah, well I did, but I guess it's a matter of opinion.
