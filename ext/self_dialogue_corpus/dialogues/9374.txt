What do you think of the old boy bands from the 90s?
Like Nsync?
Yes exactly like that.
I don't like them at all, they seem to hit a market of young to teen girls and that's really it.
I never understood it either.
I don't understand it either, how can you like that music.
I guess for teen girls or women in general it can be good but not me.
Yeah guess you shouldn't knock it if you aren't the type or something like that.
Did you ever listen to their music before?
Yeah I heard a few songs.
