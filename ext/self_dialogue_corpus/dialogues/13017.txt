Have you seen The Force Awakens yet?
Yeah I loved that movie!
Me too!  Who was your favorite character?
I loved Finn, he was pretty funny and I kind of want him and Rey to be a couple.
He does seem pretty protective of her and is very worried about her. I loved Po.
Po was great!  I was so excited when we found out that he didn't actually die in the crash.
Me too, I hope he sticks around for a while in the next one.
I also really loved Kylo Ren.  He was kind of corny but I also loved it.
I think I am most excited to see where his story line goes. Especially since he is Han and Leia's kid.
I know!  I am also hoping they will say who Rey's parents are or where she came from.
