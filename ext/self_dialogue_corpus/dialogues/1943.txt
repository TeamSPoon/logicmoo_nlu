Who do you think will win the NFC East this year?
The Eagles are being favored but I think it is wide open
Why do you think that the Eagles are so highly favored?
They done real good in free agency in the offseason
Who were some of the free agents that they signed?
LaGarrette Blount, Alshon Jeffrey, Torrey Smith, Chris Long, and they got Nick Foles back
Nick Foles! Their old quarterback
Yes. He went to Kansas City for a year. He was a casualty of the old Chip Kelly system
Still. The NFC East is packed across the board. It should be a wide open race.
The Redskins done good this offseason. The Cowboys offense is going to be good and Eli and Giants are always around.
Who were some of the free agents the Redskins accquired?
They got Terrelle Pryor and DJ Swearinger
Terrelle Pryor is going to be an elite WR in this league
He had a breakout year last year for sure
He should even do better in Washington with Kirk Cousins at quarterback
I could easily see him getting 1,200 to 1,300 yards receiving and 10 plus TD receptions
DJ Swearinger is a good player as well
He will certainly solidify the Redskins defensive backfield
The 2017 season in the NFC East should certainly be another tight one
It certainly looks like it could be
