Do you like music?
Sure! Although I have no favorite.
Really. How do you know what you like?
Well, I guess a lot depends on my mood.
That's odd isn't it? Most people have a favorite don't they? Color, pet, movie?
I don't know if it's odd but I wouldn't say I'm the only one like this.
What else tells you, "This is a good song."
Well, this may be the same as mood but something about the song just "hits" me of connects. Could be any genre.
Even Punk?
Yes, even though I'm well past "Punk" there have been some Punk songs which had a nice sound.
What about the other genres? Elevator music?
Sure. I've learned about historical music via some of the music of other centuries. Pachelbel's Cannon comes to mind.
Lyrics or melody?
Definitely the melody. And even the way certain musicians vary the same song make it better.
Don't the lyrics have a purpose?
Sometimes no. Sometimes I learn the lyrics as an after thought. Sometimes I can follow along almost subliminally. Sometimes lyrics make the song.
So there's no rhyme or reason to your musical interest?
Not really.
Have you ever liked a song and then not so much?
Tom Petty, American Girl I think. Great melody then goes completely elsewhere.
