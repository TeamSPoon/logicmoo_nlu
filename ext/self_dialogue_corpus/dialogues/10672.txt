What's the best Fast and Furious movie?
Definitely the first one!
I would agree!
It was so original back then, all the actors were great too!
I like the story line because it actually made me care!
Seeing a young Paul Walker and Vin Diesel is so unreal too.
I liked when they try to beat the train at the end
It had me on the edge of my seat!
It was so sad when they both made it but then Vin crashed!
But it still had a happy ending so I'm happy!
