I put an old home made music CD in last night. Guess what song was on it?
I could only imagine.
It's a classic.
Rock music?
No. Pop.
Couldn't guess. You liked so many.
I'll tell you. Walk Like An Egyptian.
Wow. I loved that song.
Do you remember the music video for it.
Yes, back when MTV played them.
So true.
I liked The Bangles.
Me too.
If She Knew What She Wants was a good one too.
It was. They were talented.
Not a lot of popular female bands like them.
That's for sure.
I wonder what happened to them.
Not sure.
Now I'll have to listen to that song.
