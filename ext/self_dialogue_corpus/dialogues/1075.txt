Hey do you think anyone can beat New England this year?
I think they will lose a couple games.
Do you think they will win the Super Bowl?
Yeah, I don't think anyone can beat them in the playoffs.
That is when things get serious.
Exactly.  They might get so far ahead in the regular season that they rest players so they might lose those.
Yeah.  They lost Gronk last year and still won the Super Bowl.
Exactly.  If they lose Brady, the other teams might have a chance.
Atlanta came pretty closing to beating them in the Super Bowl though.
Atlanta sure did blow it.
Yes they did.  You can't let teams that good hang around like that.
You have to put them away.
New England didn't have Gronk either and still won.
That is amazing.
The Atlanta head coach used to be the Seahawks' defensive coordinatior.
I saw that.
And you know how good the Seahwawk's defense was.
Yeah.  The legion of Boom.
They held New England in check through the first 2.5 quarters.
Then they must fell apart.
