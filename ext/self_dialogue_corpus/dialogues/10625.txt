Have you watched the latest Fast and Furious?
Yes I have. Actually I only watched the first one and the last one, that is until Vin Diesel decided to make another one haha.
Did you like it?
I liked it. It was pretty good. I like Vin Diesel turning kinda bad in some parts of the movies, but I don't want to give away the ending if you haven't watched it.
Any good car chases?
Obviously! There were a few. One was where they were going through downtown and ended up in a stand off and another big finale was towards the end of the movie. It was a bit over the top though.
I also like Ludacris' character, he adds comedy to the movie.
I think they all did. I loved the love and hate relationship between The Rock and Jason Statham.
Yeah the tough guys good guys thing.
I think they're all a good team.
