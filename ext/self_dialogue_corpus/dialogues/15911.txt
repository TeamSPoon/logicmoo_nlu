Do you like tracy lawrence
I dont know if i know him
He sings paint me a Birmingham
Oh i love that song
Me too
I didnt know who sings it
Now you do
Its such a sweet song
It is
Its kind of sad though
Its so sad
I feel so bad for the person in the song
Me too
I dont know if he sings anything else
Me either
Maybe he is a one hit wonder
It is possible
That would be sad
Yea he is a good singer
Exactly
