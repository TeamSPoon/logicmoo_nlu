Hey Mike, how've you been?
Alright, I've been busy.
What you been doing?
Working and spending time with the family.
What do you guys do together?
We watched Aladdin the other night.
That's a classic.
My kids love it.
Mine do as well.
The genie is so funny.
It's a shame about Robin Willliams though.
Yeah. He was a great entertainer.
The music in that movie is great.
My kids like to sing the songs.
It's got some great action scenes.
I like when the cave comes to life.
They chase the princess through the streets as well.
Jasmin is amazing.
It's a great story.
Disney did a good job.
