What do you think of Iron Maiden?
I love that band. They have some excellent guitar riffs.
Run To The Hills & The Trooper are two of my favorite guitar parts in their songs.
They have fans from all over the world. I am always amazed at how popular they are.
It's true. The band has been around since the 1970s and they are still just as popular as ever.
How many original band members are left at this point?
I think there is only one.
What is his name?
Steve Harris is the only one who has been in the band since the start.
Wow! He has been playing Iron Maiden songs for a long time at this point.
