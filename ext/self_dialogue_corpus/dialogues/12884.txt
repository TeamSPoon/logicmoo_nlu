What's your least favorite Star Wars movie?
I guess most people would say The Phantom Menace. But I feel like I should mix it up and say Attack of the Clones.
Why Attack of the Clones and not The Phantom Menace?
Sometimes The Phantom Menace almost works, since it has a child star who comes off as compelling.
And Attack of the Clones doesn't have that?
No, not at all! It was supposed to be building up to the Darth Vader story, but instead we get the worst movie love story in history.
You mean Padme and Anakin?
Yes, Padme and Anakin.
What's the worst feature of it?
The cheesy lines! George Lucas can create a world, but he can't speak to the person next to him.
