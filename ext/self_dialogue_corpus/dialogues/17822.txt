What have you been up to today?
Just hanging out here at the house catching up on some chores.
Have you been listening to your CD that I got you last week?
You got me two of them, I have been listening to the Chris Stapleton one.
What was the name of that album again?
It is called Traveller. It has some awesome songs on it.
I was thinking about getting it for myself. Any songs you think I would like on there?
Yea I think you would like a few of them actually.
I heard one of his on the radio the other day and I really enjoyed it.
Nobody To Blame and More Of You are both excellent songs.
Neither of those were the one that I heard on the radio.
Could it have been Tennessee Whiskey?
Yes! I think that was it actually.
Yea that song is on the album as well.
I think I may just go buy that one tomorrow.
I think it would be a good investment for you. You could listen to it going to work.
I know, that is one reason I am wanting to buy me a good CD.
Are you getting tired of listening to the radio?
Not really, I just want to have a CD to listen to when I am in the mood for it.
I understand that. I think you would really enjoy a lot of Chris Stapleton music.
