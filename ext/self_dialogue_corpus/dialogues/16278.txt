What kind of music do you listen to?
I like a little bit of everything.  I've been on a country kick lately though.
Who do you listen to?
I really like Florida Georgia Line and Lady Antebellum.
They're both pretty great.  I've seen Florida Georgia Line in concert.
I bet that was amazing!  What did you think of them in concert?
They put on one heck of a show!
I haven't been to a concert in a long time. The last concert I went to was when I was a teen.  I saw Guns N Roses.
I bet that was a great concert.  I love the rock bands from the 80s and 90s!
They were really good.
I always wanted to see them.  I always thought Axl Rose was pretty crazy!
He definitely is!  What concerts have you been to recently?
Well, besides seeing Florida Georgia Line, I've seen Foreigner, Matchbox 20, Adelle and Luke Bryan.
All great performances I bet!
For sure, none of the disappointed!
How was Luke Bryan?
He's great.  I love his music!
He's definitely one of my favorites.  I wouldn't mind seeing him in concert.
It's worth it if you ever get the chance.
I bet!
