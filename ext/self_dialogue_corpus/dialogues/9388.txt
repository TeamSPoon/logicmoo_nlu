Which is the better Madlib collaboration album: Madvillainy or Pi単ata?
Madvillainy is definitely more iconic, but I actually prefer Pi単ata.
Wow, that's really interesting. I didn't know other people felt that way too.
You mean you prefer Pi単ata as well?
Oh yeah, definitely. One thing I like is all the different features.
Yeah, there are some great rappers on the album. You get quite a variety.
They're both classic albums though. Pi単ata is only slightly better in my opinion.
Yeah, and they're both very different albums with different stories and visions.
I would love to see Madlib do an album like that with Mos Def.
That would be awesome! Too bad Yasiin Bey says he's retired now.
