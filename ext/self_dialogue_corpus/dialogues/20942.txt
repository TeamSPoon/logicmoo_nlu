So I saw a real cool zombie movie the other day.
There's been a ton of them recently.  Which one.
Remember Zombieland from a few years back?
Yeah, I do.  That was a funny movie.
I didn't realize how many stars were in it.
Emma Stone, Jesse Eisenberg, Woody Harrelson..
Don't forget the younger sister who has been in about 500 movies it seems.
Oh, you mean Abagail Breslin.
Yep.  She's been in everything.
As for the movie itself, I thought the Bill Murray cameo was fantastic.
Yeah, that was neat to see.  And the fact they killed him off.
It was an accident, but it was a great way for him to poke fun at himself.
Remember the whole part about the twinkies?
Yeah, how he can't find one in the apocalypse?
He did at the end, but it was funny to see them find the whole van of cupcakes and him getting mad.
You would think you would be happy to find any food really.
That was also before Emma Stone was a bigger name.
She would command a lot higher salary now.
I wish they'd make a sequel.
They've talked about it for years, but I don't think it will ever happen.
