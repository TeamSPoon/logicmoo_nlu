I love The Clash!
They're awesome! The song "Train In Vain" is one of my favorites.
That one is great. I am also a big fan of "London Calling"
Was Joe Strummer in The Clash?
He was! Along with Mick Jones.
What a great combination. They are great musicians.
They were part of the original wave of British Punk.
I think that they formed way back in 1976.
It is amazing that their music still holds up.
Great music always does!
