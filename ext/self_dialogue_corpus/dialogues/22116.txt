I just saw Boss Baby.
How was it?
Not very good at all.  My kids were disappointed.
Why was it so bad?
It just felt like the script was so workshopped and had so many overdone pop culture references.
I don't like when they do that. Who was in the movie?
It starred Alec Baldwin, who played the baby.
Wow I'm surprised. Usually his movies are great.
Yeah I was surprised too.
Isn't Lisa Kudrow in it?
Yeah, she played Baldwin's mom.
Was there anything good about the movie?
Well, it was silly and did not really teach any lessons, which my kids loved, but I like when there's a greater message.
I can understand that, especially because you want your kids to learn something.
Exactly, but I suppose not everything can teach our kids.
My kids were asking to see it, but I guess I won't take them now.
You can take them, they will probably enjoy it; it's just a little rough for parents.
I'll ask if them if they want to go this weekend.
Let me know what they think.
I will!
