Do you like the Jesus and Mary Chain?
No, are they a Christian rock band?
Haha, no. They're a Scottish indie rock band, started in the late 80s.
What do they sound like?
Great rock. Their first album was really unique. Awash in tons of guitar feedback.
That sounds terrible ...
It's not for everybody, haha. But they also had really catchy tunes. Sweet melodies.
What songs are they known for?
You might have heard Just Like Honey. That was on the soundtrack for Lost in Translation.
Oh, I remember that! That was a good song. What else?
I like Head On. It was covered by the Pixies.
Oh, I think I heard that cover version. Another great song.
Yeah they were great songwriters, I think.
What album do you recommend?
I like their first album Psychocandy. A great blend of noise and melody.
How about something more mellow?
Their second album Darklands is also great, in a different way. Much mellower and more melancholic.
Any other bands that sound like them?
The Raveonettes sound somewhat like them.
Cool
