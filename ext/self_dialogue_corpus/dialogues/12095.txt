Did you see the last star wars?
Yes I did, I really enjoyed it.  Did you?
Yes, I loved it. I loved the cameos too.
Do you mean carrie fischer?
Yes and seeing the character of luke in the other one as well.
I enjoyed star wars bringing the original cast back as well. I wonder what they will do now that carrie fischer passed away?
I was wondering how they will handle that as well. Maybe they will have more cgi carrie.
Funny, my dad thought that was just an actress who looked like her.
That is funny. That scene was so impressive. I also loved when vader came on board.
That was my favorite part of that film . It was so good. The lighting the drama of it, just so well done.
