Did you see the live version of Beauty and the Beast?
Yes, I did.
What did you think about it?
I actually liked it a lot. I didn't think I was going to.
Why is that?
Because I am such a huge fan of the animated version.
Oh, yeah, me, too.
At first, I kept comparing the two in my head, but after a while, I really got into it.
Well, thanks for your thoughts about it. I'm going to check it out as well.
I think you'll enjoy it if you just take it on it's own, don't compare.
