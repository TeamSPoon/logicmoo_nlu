how are you
I am great!
I was just watching Ellen, she had Jack Johnson on
Who is that
He is a beach guy basically who makes amazing music
Hmmmm have any examples?
He has one that he sings for Curious george
Oh I love him
I will play the video for upside down, its so cute
I absolutely love his voice, so soft and clear
He is perfect for curious george
do you like classical music?
Sometimes yes, if I am reading and drinking a glass of wine
Whats your favorite song?
Hard to choose, it depends on what I am in the mood for, I would say Johannes Brahms  Hungarian Dance
Hmmm, I would love to hear that
I have it on my Ipod, one second
Wow, that is beautiful
Music definitly alters my mood
its amazing
