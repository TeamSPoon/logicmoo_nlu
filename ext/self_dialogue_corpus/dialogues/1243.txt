Yea, there are a few teams that just seem to be bordering falling off.
Yea, Seattle may be one and Green Bay may be another.
Yea, I agree, but Denver has to be at the top of the list.
Yea, what are they doing?
Well, it seems like they have spent a lot of money on their defense.
Nothing on their offense though.
No, they literally have very few playmakers there.
Yea, who follows up a superbowl with a 7th round rookie QB?
Yea, I do not know how they thought that could have worked.
That could have been a distaster.
Yea, they are lucky he turned out okay, but still not good enough.
Yea, it was too bad that they couldn't build on that success.
Well, when you go from a hall of fame quarterback to a scrub, stuff like that tends to happen.
I agree. The defense just couldn't carry them enough.
Yea, the defense can only do so much.
Yea, they were living proof of that this year.
They sure were and it didn't work out to well for them.
Yea, maybe this year will be better.
I do not know. They still don't have a quarterback.
You're right. It might take a couple years.
