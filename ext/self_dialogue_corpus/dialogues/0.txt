Have you seen Thor?
Yes I have.
Who is your favorite character?
It's Thor because he's the hero and one that still has a lot to prove to himself and others.
That's a good point, can you guess my favorite?
Thor also?
No, it's Loki.
Why?
Loki is michevious and does what he needs to or thinks he needs to.  He's that odd bad guy that you just like.
Fair enough.
