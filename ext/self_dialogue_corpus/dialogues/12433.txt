Where in the Star Wars universe would you want to live?
Coruscant would be the coolest place. How about you?
I'd want to live on Naboo. It looks pretty.
In Coruscant, I think you'd have more opportunities and lots of people there
Many of the places are inhospitable, too hot or cold
You would want to live somewhere you could do something
You might want to go somewhere where there wasn't constant wars
You would not want to be somewhere they would destroy your planet
Coruscant seems like a good one not to blow up, but not free from war
It would be a great place to explore
