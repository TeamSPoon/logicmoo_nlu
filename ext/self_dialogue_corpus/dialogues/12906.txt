Who do you think Supreme Leader Snoke is?
I'm not sure. I've heard all sorts of theories from Emperor Palpatine to Darth Vader.
I'm not sure they would go that way. I think it is a new character.
Sure, but I bet they will tie the backstory into the Sith we know.
You never know, they could do something completely out of left field and make him loosely or non-affiliated with the Sith.
Woah, I never thought of that. That could be cool.
What if they made it like he thought he was "improving the Sith"?
That's an interesting take on things. But I bet they stick to what people know.
True.
Should be exciting either way!
