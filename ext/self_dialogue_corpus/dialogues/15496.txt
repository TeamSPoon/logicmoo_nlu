I don't like the new Linkin Park single.
Which one is that?
It's called Heavy. It's a duet with Kiiara. But I think it sounds too poppy.
I think I've heard of it. What makes you say that?
Well, Linkin Park is traditionally a rock band with hip hop influences. This is a bit away from their normal work.
Interesting. It may be just that they are trying to keep up and stay relevant with other artists.
It has a lot of melody in the song. No screaming. No cursing. No crunchy guitar riffs.
Okay, but does it really need all those?
Maybe, maybe not.
Have you given the single a listen and just actually listened to it without bias?
No, I guess I haven't.
It's perfectly alright to be a fan of an artist and not like a direction they take.
Yeah, you're right.
But don't let others' opinions of the music change your opinion before you give a real chance.
That makes sense. I'm going to listen to it again right now.
Why don't we listen together?
Alright. You know I do kind of like this. It's melodic and sad.
I agree. Linkin Park has a tendency to go the angry side of things but this is a nice change.
That's true. I think I'm going to buy the new album and give all the new tracks a chance.
Sounds good. I think I'll do the same.
