Have you ever heard of a film called "Vertigo"? I was thinking of watching it again and thought you might like it.
Tell me more - who's in it, and what's it about? I might want to join you.
Do you remember the film we watched last week, called "Bell,Book. and Candle"?
Yes, that chick put a spell on Jimmy Stewart. That was Kim Novak, right?
Yep, and she's plenty witchy in this Hitchock thriller. And Jimmy Stewart is in it too.
Okay, okay, give me the plot line You've got my attention.
Kim Novak plays the wife of on of Jimmy's old friends. There's something seriously wrong with her, and the guy asks Jimmy to watch her for a while.
You mean like tail her? What is he, some kind of detective?
Yes, and one who has just recovered from a serious fall. That's why it's called "Vertigo", and it's got everything- haunting. possession, romance, suspense, you name it!
I think I remember it. She was possessed by the spirit of Carlotta - and yes, it's a great flick, let's watch it now!
