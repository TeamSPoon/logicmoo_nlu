What do you think of this new ripped jeans look?
Ug, I hate it.
SO do I. It's like people are spending money to look ragged.
I don't let my kids buy stuff like that.
Neither do I and if their clothes do get ripped and I can't fix it we toss it out.
Don't do that. I can make quilts with the scraps.
I've always wanted to know how.
I can show you.
That would be great. I just got a lot of stained stuff out of Katie's closet this morning.
That means she needs new clothes then, right?
Yes. She's into all the new trends.
So are my kids.
We should go to the thrift store to find her some new stuff and we can get your kids something too.
That would be fun. I love thrift stores because you can get trendy clothes for less.
Some of that namebrand stuff is too expensive new.
I agree. I can't see paying those prices for a shirt.
Neither can I but I'll buy it used.
I have no problem with that either.
When do you want to go?
No time like the present I guess.
