What are some songs from your childhood?
Oh man, I listened to a lot of rap so it's hard to say
If you had to just pick one song for me to listen to, what would you pick?
I really liked Wasn't Me by Shaggy
What is it about?
It's about a guy who got caught cheating
That's all?
Well he keeps denying it despite lots of evidence that his girlfriend has
That's odd. You listened to it as a kid?
Well I didn't know what the words meant?
What are some funny lines from the song?
He sang something like "Caught me banging in the shower, wasn't me"
That's funny. When did you listen to that song last?
Not since like 2010. I don't really like it anymore
Why not?
Shaggy has a harsh Jamaican accent that makes it hard to understand
That probably helped you not understand the words when you were younger
That and I just didn't know what the suggestive lyrics were talking about
What is Shaggy up to now?
I'm not sure, he hasn't made any songs for years as far as I know!
