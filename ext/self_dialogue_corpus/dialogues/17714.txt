The greatest rock band of all time is Rush.
I thought they were prog rock.
Potato potawto.... greatest of all time!
Prove it.
I could put on 2112 or permanent waves.
Or you could admit you are wrong.
The drummer Neil Peart is considered the best drummer of all tim.
Not better than John Bonham or Kieth Moon.
Yup, better, and still touring in his 60s, those guys are dead.
A drummer does not make the whole band.
Geddy Lee is consistently rated in the top 5 best bassists of all time.
Still not impressed.
As well as slappin that bass he sings and plays keyboards with his feet.
They still aren't the Stones or the Beatles.
No, but they have sold more records than both.
Bullcrap.
Over 20 albums all platinum at least.
I guess I need to listen to them.
Check out one of the live albums, that is when they sound the best. It's like 3 guys sound like an orchestra!
Okay, okay, but still not the greatest of all time.
