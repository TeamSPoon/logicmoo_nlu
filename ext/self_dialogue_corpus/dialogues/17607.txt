What's your favorite music genre?
I don''t really listen to music
Oh, really?
Yea, it's kinda boring
Why's that?
I dont know. I guess I just stopped listening to it after I had kids.
Oh I see.  Yea kids change things at times.
Yea, but I used to listen to classic rock
Like Zeppelin?
Yea!  They used to be awesome!
I agree!  I find that they were totally awesome back in the day1
Yea, or Ozzy!
Ozzy was and still IS the man!
Like Crazy Train!
I used to listen to that song while I worked out
Me too!
Or when I had my friends over we'd all jam to it
Good times!
Couldn't agree more
Hey, let's put some on!
