do you like garbage
the band?
yeah the british band from the 90's
the singer used to be a celeb crush for me
she was a good frontwoman
she was the alternative gothy chick in the 90s
fix me now was such a good song
it was melodic and sad at the same time
then there was happy when it rains
that song is a 90s classic
its on a lot of top 100 90s lists
it is?
it is pretty popular
its their most well known song
i still hear it on the radio sometimes
they do a lot of happy sounding but sad songs
they really do
but they also have sad quiet songs like milk
that song is heartbreaking
i dont even know what its about
