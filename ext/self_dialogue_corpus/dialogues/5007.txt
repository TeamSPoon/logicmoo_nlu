What do you think about instant replay?
I think as long as we use human umpires, instant replay needs to keep being used in order to get the calls correct.
You want to take the human element out of it?
No, I just want calls to be correct. If a guy is safe, and is called out because the umpire was out of position, that is ridiculous.
But eventually won't that lead to all umpires being replaced by robots?
Sure, and I'm fine with that.
How could you say that?
Well, the game is still being played by humans.
But, jobs...
They aren't worthy of their jobs. They mess them up constantly.
I disagree.
Seriously? Answer me this question:
Okay.
You know how the strike zone "expands" under a lot of umpires with two strikes, or two outs, or late in the game?
Yeah.
Why should that exist? The strike zone is the strike zone. It doesn't expand or contract.
Yeah, that's true. I hate seeing balls WAY out of the zone called as strikes because of the situation.
I think the only thing human umpires should be used for is to break up fights and set things in motion.
For that, they can just use hired security.
True. No more umpires!
