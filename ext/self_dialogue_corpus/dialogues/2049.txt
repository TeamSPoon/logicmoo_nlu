Who was the winner of the first Super Bowl?
It was Green Bay.
Oh really?
Yes, there weren't nearly as many teams back then. They won the first two.
Do they have the most?
No, I think that's the Steelers with six.
How many does Green Bay have then?
Four I think. The first two, one in the '90s and one in 2011.
Who did they beat in 2011?
Actually, I'm pretty sure it was the Steelers?
Patriots have to be closing in on the Steelers right?
They have five, and all of them in the 2000s and 2010s.
That's really impressive.
I know. And from what I hear, I think they are favorites for next year.
Yes, but so much can happen in a season.
Very true. They need to stay healthy and with a 40 year old quarterback, that isn't easy.
It is pretty amazing to see how good Brady still is.
Well, he takes really good care of himself.
He definitely does. I'm looking forward to seeing what he can do this year.
Well, you are a Pats fan, so I guess you would be!
