What is your favorite Harry Potter movie?
Oh, that's a tough one! They are all amazing in their own way.
Come on, you have to pick one.
Well, the earlier ones are more kid-like, and the later ones get progressively darker.
That didn't answer my question, haha.
Well, it depends on my mood. If I want something light I would pick Sorcerer's Stone.
I get that, but say you have to pick one and only one, what is your answer.
Fine, okay then I would have to pick Goblet of Fire.
Why Goblet?
Well, it is the turning point in the movies/books. Things get serious and when Voldemort comes back and Dumbledore sees him the story actually begins.
