Toy Story was really cute wasn't it?
I loved that movie.
Woody was quite a character.
And so was Jess.
Remember how Andy packed up all his toys and gave them away when he was moving?
Yea those poor toys.
Then they got out of the box and set off on an adventure to get home.
Yea.
Remember when they got tossed in the garbage ?
I sure do.
Tom Hanks did the voice of Woody.
The movie grossed 373 million dollars on the first weekend it opened.
Holy Cow! That is a lot of money!!!!!!
Then came Toy Story 2
And Toy Story 3.
The first one is always the best one.
I agree.
I heard that Toy Story 4 is coming out in 2019.
Really??
Yea, but it won't be as good as the original one.
