I am looking for a good song to play for my fiance.
What about yea boy?
I have never heard that song, who sings it?
Kelsea Ballerini sings it.
I do like her as an artist.
Yes, I do too and I like that song because it is upbeat.
I will check it out. Do you have any other suggestions?
How about Love Me Like You Do.
That is a good song. Who sings it again?
Ellie Goulding sings it.
That's right, she has an amazing voice.
I agree with you.
Which song should I choose?
Why not choose both?
That's a great idea. Thanks.
Your welcome.
I will have to listen to the Kelsea Ballerini song soon.
You should, I think you will really like it.
Thank you for suggesting it.
Your welcome.
