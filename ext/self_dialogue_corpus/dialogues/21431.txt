Have you seen any of the Marvel movies?
Of course which ones are you talking about?
Well for instance lets say Spiderman?
That hasnt come out yet.
Yeah but theres already been like 6 of them.
I have seen all those
Do you think the new one will be better?
Yeah I think they have better directors now.
The old ones werent bad.
No they werent but you never know.
I think the universe its in is right.
Will Ironman be in it?
I think he will have a bigger role.
What about Black Panther?
They should introduce him slightly.
They have so many characters though.
I dont know if they can fit them all in one movie.
What about as cameo roles?
Most of the movies already have that.
I agree it would be best to do so.
