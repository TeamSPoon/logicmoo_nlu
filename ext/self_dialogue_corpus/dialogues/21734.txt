Hey, did you see the new Wonder Woman movie?
Not yet, actually. I was thinking about it.
It's actually really great!
Huh, no kidding? What's it about?
Well, you know, it starts off with Wonder Woman's origin and all.
Yeah, and then what?
Oh, I can't tell you that. You have to watch it yourself!
Ha, I guess you're right. I'm not usually into superhero films.
Me neither lately, but this one was better than most of them.
That reminds me, are you going to see the new Spiderman movie?
Oh, I totally forgot that's coming out soon.
Pretty soon, yeah. I was thinking about seeing it.
I thought you weren't into comic book based movies though?
I mean, not usually, but Spiderman's kind of one of my favorites.
Me too, actually. They've made alot of movies about him but I always end up enjoying them.
So you'll go see it, too?
I probably will, although it's going to be hard to top Wonder Woman's movie.
I'll be the judge of that, when I go see it.
You wanna go this weekend then? I don't mind seeing it again.
Sure thing, you're on. See you there at eight.
