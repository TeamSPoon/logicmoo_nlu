Hey, do you keep up with NFL football?
I used to, not anymore.
Oh, that's too bad, why not?
Too much drama.
What do you mean?
I mean all the steroids and cheating and stuff.
Oh, but you don't really think they use steroids do you?
Of course they do, have you seen the size of them?
That's not proof though.
Maybe not. But in any case, it's just too violent of a sport.
But that's why people love it. It;s about being tough.
Yea well being tough gives a bunch of guys fatal concussions before the age of 50.
Well, they get paid a lot of money to do it.
Yea, but it's just not something I want to be promoting.
Well I love it, the comradery, the athleticism, the sportsmanship, all of it.
Yea, you're right, there are a lot of good aspects to it too.
Yea, you should give it another chance, it's not going anywhere.
Maybe you're right. Who's your favorite team?
I like the Patriots.
Ok, then. So do I.
