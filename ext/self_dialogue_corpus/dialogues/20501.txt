What was one of your favorite movies when you were a kid?
I really like The Black Cauldron.
Oh I love that movie! That one was so good!
Yeah it's one of my favorite movies actually, it's a classic.
What do you like most about it?
I like how dark it is for a Disney movie, it's probably the most dark out of all the others they've done.
Yeah that's for sure, very dark indeed.
I also like all the classic fantasy elements, like magic and dragons and an evil king.
That was always fun to watch, it made you feel like you were in a different world.
It was very convincing when you were little, you felt lost in it.
I certainly did, but I was scared of the Horned King to death.
Me too, he was a very scary Disney villain.
His face was like a skeleton and he had red eyes, very spooky.
His voice was also very creepy and loud.
I think the whole idea of him bringing back an army of the dead is really cool, but scary.
Me too, when you're that young it's the kind of stuff that gives you nightmares.
I don't think I ever had any nightmares about that movie.
I certainly did, the little dragons that chase the pig around scared me.
They did? That's funny.
It definitely wasn't funny for me, that's a very scary movie when you're a kid.
