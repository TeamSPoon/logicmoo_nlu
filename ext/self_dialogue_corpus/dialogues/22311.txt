Are they going to make anymore Indiana Jones films?
I hope not!
Why?!
Did you see Kingdom of the Crystal Skull?
Yeah, It was great!
OK?
What you didn't like it?
No!
Why?
It was just so forced.
How do you mean?
All the jokes.
I don't understand.
They were just bland and referencing previous films.
I guess I can see that. But I think they should make some more.
Harrison Ford is like a hundred!
Yeah, but I thought Shia LaBeouf might take up the mantle.
Lord help us all!
What? He's pretty good.
Yeah, but not Dr. Jones caliber.
