Are you a fan of hip hop?
I am but I don't like the new stuff they're playing on the radio.
It's terrible in my opinion. I think it stopped being good in the early 2000's.
That is definitely when it started going downhill. I do like Kendrick Lamar though.
Right he is one of the few exceptions of good hip hop artists today.
Also the old school artists who are still going strong like Nas. They give hip hop hope.
I love Nas. I heard he's with Nicky Minaj now.
Really? Well that's not really a surprise, he was with Kelis who doesn't seem like she's a fit with him.
it's just that he's a conscious rapper so you'd think he'd be more selective about who he's with.
Well I heard she's a really nice person so that might have something to do with it.
