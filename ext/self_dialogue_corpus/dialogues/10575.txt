Hey how have yo been doing?
I've been doing well! How about you?
Pretty good, see any good movie or go to any good concert recently?
No concerts, but I did see a great movie last night!
Oh really? What movie was that?
It was Baywatch, a very funny movie.
I think I saw the trailer for that, who stars in it?
I has The Rock and Zach Efron.
Oh I love both of those actors.
They were great in the movie they have good chemistry.
I want to see Baywatch, I was a fan of the show.
It is different than the show, but very funny.
What would you compare it too then?
Probably 21 Jump street, it has the hilarious buddy cop feel to it.
That sounds very interesting, I will check it out.
You will love it I am sure.
Have you seen anything else recently?
No, I am waiting for a good horror movie to come out soon.
IT should be coming out eventually.
Yeah I am excited for that one.
