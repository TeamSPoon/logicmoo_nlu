Are you a Tom Cruise fan?
I wouldn't say I'm a fan, but I do like his movies.
Cool, which is your favorite movie?
I don't have a favorite, there are too many.
Well name some that you like then.
Ok, Days of Thunder.
Never heard of that one, what's that about.
It's just Tom Cruise as a race car drive. Nicole Kidman was in it too.
Oh right I remember it now. Ok, what else?
Top Gun of course.
Top Gun was awesome! That's one of my all time favorites.
Cocktails was another good one.
Wow, you really like the older one.
Well, I liked all those old 80s movies.
What about newer ones, like Jack Reacher?
I liked the first Jack Reacher. The second one was dumb.
No way! They were both cool.
The first one had it's moments.
You mean like the scene when he beats up all those guys outside the restaurant.
Yea, that was my favorite scene by far.
