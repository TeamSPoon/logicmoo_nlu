Did you see Game 1 of the Spurs vs. Warriors series?
Yes, it was a great comeback by the Warriors.
Did you see when Kawhi Leonard got injured?
Yes, he landed on Pachulia's foot when he shot the ball.
I think it was intentional by Zaza Pachulia.
I don't know. He is just an awkward player.
The way he put out his foot looked weird to me.
He is big and lumbering so he needed an extra step to slow his momentum.
No, he was already landed.
Why would he want to do that intentionally, though?
The Spurs were winning and Leonard is their best player.
Sure, but that seems a bit farfetched.
Not in the playoffs. Players will do anything to win.
I don't think it matters. The Warriors may have lost that game, but they would win the series anyway.
That may be true. The team is stacked.
Exactly. The Spurs may have pushed them to six or seven games at best.
The Spurs just don't have the personnel.
That's why they went belly-up without Kawhi. They need another star player to compete.
Looks like they will end up getting swept now. Did you see game 2 and 3?
Yes. This series is over.
