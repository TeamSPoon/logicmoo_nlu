Hey, do you like 80s music?
Yeah, I do!
What are some of your favorites?
Well, I really like Madonna. Her early stuff was great!
I like Madonna, too! What your favorite song by her?
Wow, that's a hard question. I guess it depends on my mood, but "Like a Prayer" is really good.
What about "Vogue"?
Oh yeah, that's a great one, too!
I've always liked her slower songs. "Crazy for You" is really romantic.
Tell me about it. My older sister used that as her wedding song.
Really?
Yeah, she fell in love with it the first time she ever heard it.
That's really sweet!
Have you heard any of Madonna's newer stuff?
Yeah, but I don't like much of anything she's done since 2000.
I totally get that. It's always fun seeing her with younger performers though.
You mean like Britney Spears and Lady Gaga?
Yeah.
I like watching those performances, too. She's definitely a big influence on the female singers who came after her.
Agreed. She's a legend.
