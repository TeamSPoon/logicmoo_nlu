Hey! Are you excited about football season this year?
I am.  I can't wait to root for the Bengals.
Do you really think they will even be decent this year?
I hope so. It isn't much fun rooting for a losing team.
Maybe they will bounce back and be in the playoffs this time.  Third in their division wasn't terrible, but wasn't great either.
I know! I hated watching them lose so much.  How do you think the Panthers will do?
I am excited for the Panthers this year.  I think they will be fun to watch.
Do you get to go to any games this season?
Actually, I think I do!  I am actually off a couple of weekends they play at home.
That is great! I wish I lived closer to Cincinnati, then I could actually see the Bengals play in person.
If they were playing the Panthers this year I would say come with me, but they aren't.
Thanks for the offer, but you are right.  The schedule just isn't on my side this year.
Lets hope the schedule is one their side and they play better than last year.
Now that is funny.
Of course, we could say the same thing about the Panthers.  They weren't so hot last season either.
True, but I think they are due. I really do.
Did they get some awesome drafts picks or something?
They got a few prospects and a few promising trades too.
Well, I guess we both can keep our fingers crossed for better seasons.
I think I will be crossing my toes too.
