What good horror movie should we watch tonight?
How about a classic? Like from the 90's.
You mean like Halloween?
Yes. They are old, but good.
Mike Meyers is just a creepy guy to look at.
Yeah and how many times you think he's dead, he's really not.
I don't know. Maybe the remake of Halloween.
I thought that one was great.
Maybe We will watch the remake of Halloween. Good idea.
See I come in handy every once in a while.
