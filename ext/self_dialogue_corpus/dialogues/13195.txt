Was General Grievous a Sith warrior?
Not quite.  He was just trained in certain Sith aspects, but he wasn't a Sith.
But he was trained by Count Dooku, wasn't he?
He was, but as mentioned in the previous movie, there can only be two Sith.
Oh, a master and apprentice, right?
That's correct.
Even if he wasn't Sith, I think Grievous was pretty interesting.
He had biologic parts, which is probably why he was Force sensitive.
Do you think he was a better villain than Count Dooku?
With that, I'd disagree.  Christopher Lee did such a terrific job portraying the Count.
