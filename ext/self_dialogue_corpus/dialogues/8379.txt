Have you heard of the new song of Taylor Swift?
Yes, I have. I've always loved Taylor Swift and have been a fan since the beginning
Oh really? What is your favorite songs
I love White horse, such a beautiful old song. Style is a great song too
Oh! white horse is so emotional and beautiful, I totally agree
Those emotional songs were the ones that made a fan of Taylor
Have you been to her latest concerts?
Yes! they're amazing, you get to see her famous friends at her concerts too
Wow! that's certainly worth the money, we should go to one of her concerts together since I've never been to any of them.
I would love to and I'm sure you will love it.
