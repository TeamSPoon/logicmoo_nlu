Have you ever watched narnia?

The lion, the Wardrope and the witch.
No never heard of it.
Really,thats the first Narnia
i thought the voyage of the dawn threader was the first
No  its the second or the third
who is in it?
the same people in the voyage of the dawn threader just this time it was an evil ice queen and they changed a few people
oh really, so how is it?
Its a great movie
whats the different between it and the other narnia's?
its different because its the start of all narnia.
well so how will you rate it?
9/10
why 9/10?
because ther were some scenes that i didnt understand it just happened and there was also some scenes that took long.
i will watch it but i cant promise you that i will like it.
it doesn't matter we all have different things we prefer or like.
you're so right but thanks for telling me.
