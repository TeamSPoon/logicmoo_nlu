Why didn't Randy Moss break all of Jerry Rices records?
Have you seen Jerry Rices records?
A few of them, but they seem breakable.
First, Jerry Rice played in the NFL for 20 years.  That's incredible.
How long did Randy Moss play?
I think it was 14 years but his last 2 years he really didn't play much.
Ok, so Jerry played 8 more years.  That's why Randy didn't break his records.
It's a factor, but let's look at some of Jerry's records.
Like which one?
Ok career receiving yards.  Jerry Rice had 22,895 yards.
What is second place for yards?
Terrell Owens with 15,934 and Randy Moss is 3rd with 15,292 yards.
That's a pretty big gap between first and second.
Let's look at career receiving touchdowns?
Ok, so how many did Jerry have?
Jerry Rice had 197 career receiving touchdowns.
Let me guess Terrell Owens is second?
No, Terrell is 3rd with 153 and Randy Moss is second with 156.
Dang, Jerry Rice destroyed the record book.
Yeah, see Randy Moss was great but Jerry Rice was almost a football god.
