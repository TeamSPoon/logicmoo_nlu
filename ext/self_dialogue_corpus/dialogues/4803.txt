I really hope the Orioles can win the division this year.
Yeah it's going to be tough with the Yankees' resurgence this year.
But think about it. They are only a game and a half behind the yankees.
True. The Orioles have been playing pretty well this year.
I just hope they can keep it up. The yankees have really re-tooled their organization.
Yeah, but I would love to see David slay Goliath
This Orioles team is not a great hitting team, but they have their abundance of sluggers.
Yeah Chris Davis and Manny Machado are definitely dangerous hitters.
These guys can go yard at anytime.
In addition, Dylan Bundy has been pitching really well this year for them .
Yeah right now his ERA is under 3.00. And he has already accumulated 5 wins this year.
Yeah I didn't see that coming from him, but that's been a bonus
If he can keep that up throughout the year I give the Orioles a chance to take down the Yankees.
I don't know. It seems anytime they go up against the yankees they wet the bed.
True, but if they just play consistently throughout the year then they have a great chance.
I hope you're right because I cant' stand the Yankees.
Me too. But trust me it is not going to be easy. They are going to have to earn it.
They just need to play better on the road.
Yeah right now they are 13-3 at home but 3 games under .500 on the road.
yeah they are going to have to improve that record to win this division.
