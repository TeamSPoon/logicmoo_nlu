What is the first Beatles song you remember?
I don't know. Probably Hey Jude.
That was an early one for me, too, but my earliest was Hello Goodbye. We had the single from when it first came out!
Very cool!
Yeah, I thought it was a children's record! I can still remember listening to it on the little record player by the fireplace in our family room.
Totally cool. I remember Hey Jude from the radio.
Same here! Everyone in the car shut up when it was playing.
Well, that's rare!
So true! We had that single, too, and my neice, Liz, used to go crazy at the "Hey Jude-a Jude-a Jude-a Jude-a" part at the end.
Kids are so funny!
