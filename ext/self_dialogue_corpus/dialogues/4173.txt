What's your favorite thriller movie?
Poltergeist, even though it's cheesy now that I'm older.
Yeah, that scared me so much as a kid.
Me too, but now I can show it to my kids.
Really, do they like it?
No, they are scared to death, but they kind of like it.
Special effects today are much better, but this movie is a classic.
You're right.  How can you beat the crazy happenings in that movie?
You can't help but like the basic fear factor in the movie.
True, I think that movie will continue to be a classic for our grandchildren too.
