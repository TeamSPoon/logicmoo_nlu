Have you ever heard of death metal?
Yeah, that's the music where the just scream.
Pretty much, but it's got some good rock music to it.
I don't really like death metal.
What kind of rock music do you like?
I'm more of a classic rock person.
I love classic rock, too.
I think classic rock is the best rock music.
It really is one of the better types of rock music.
I think there is something they captured in the 60s and 70s that can't be recreated.
I wonder what it is about that time period that made music so good?
I think it was the culture of America and how it was changing.
I guess a lot of songs are about the changing of the culture.
Another thing was unlike today you didn't have to be a model to be a musician.
Yeah Janis Joplin wasn't the prettiest woman but she had some jams.
You can hear her pouring her soul out in Me and my Bobby McGee.
That's another thing that's missing, singers actually feeling the lyrics.
It's hard to feel the lyrics when someone else wrote the song for you.
There really aren't a lot of singer songwriters anymore.
I don't think anyone writes their own songs anymore.
