Who was your favorite The Goblet of Fire.
Mad Eye for sure.
Yeah, even though it wasn't him?
Especially since it wasn't him.  I mean the guy impersonating him did such a perfect job he fooled everyone.
Except Harry, and the teachers at the end.
Yeah, just in a nick of time they figured him out.
I know, I love how close Voldy always is to getting Harry.
Yeah, always by a whisker.
It's what makes it such a good series.
Agreed, always has you in doubt.
