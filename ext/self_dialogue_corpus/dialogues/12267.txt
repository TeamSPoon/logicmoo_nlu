I'm really excited to see how they handle the Han Solo spin off.
Me too, he's a very beloved character, it might be tough to do it justice.
Agreed, Rogue One was handling a cast of unknowns so it was easy to win people over.
Yeah, we've already seen a young Han Solo in the original trilogy so it's going to be weird to see somebody that isn't Harrison Ford.
I have to imagine they know what they're doing though.
Oh definitely, the casting is pretty great, it'll just be weird since we already have that young frame of reference in mind.
For sure, I'm interested to see Donald Glover take up the Lando role.
He is mega talented so I know he's going to knock it out of the park.
Lots of Star Wars to look forward to this and next year.
I am glad to be along on the journey with you my friend.
