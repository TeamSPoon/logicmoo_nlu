Think free agency will be big this year?
No I think itll be minor moves.
Everyone overpays at some juncture.
Itll be interesting to see if Vegas does it.
Yeah they have the pickings to do so.
I think they should have the first pick of the entry draft.
Well they can choose players from every team so thats a bit unfair.
No whats unfair is a team like Philly gets a number 2 pick in a year where its a top 2 draft.
We know what happened in 2007.
Yeah they missed out.
So maybe its reparations.
Or maybe we can point to that and say hey we dont know if itll work out.
Yeah you never know with the NHL draft.
Would anyone be able to start immediately?
I think the first 2 picks are ready for the league.
Man I remember when you had to do time in the minors.
That was a long time ago my friend
Yeah could you imagine Gretzky playing in the AHL.
Didnt he?
Think he was in the WHL first.
