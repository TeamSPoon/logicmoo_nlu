So, how do you feel about the blues?
As a genre? Well, I'm not a huge fan.
Why not?
I don't know, it's hard to describe, but I just feel that I can't really connect with the music in a way the artists intended.
Do you think that has to do with the time we're living in, now?
Yes. To me, the blues is all about the historical moment in which artists like John Lee Hooker lived.
It's interesting because didn't those artists sort of come out of retirement in the 1960s?
Yes, because bands like the Rolling Stones were huge blues fans.
See, that's always been so funny to me, that Mick Jagger was a well-off white kid who studied economics in London, but he wanted to sound like a bluesman.
Well, I think we always are fascinated by those whose lives are unlike ours, who say something about the human condition.
Clearly Mick, and Keith Richards, who was in art school at the time, felt the music spoke to them in some way.
Being disaffected young men, I'm sure it did, because that's what the blues and rock and roll are all about.
So, how do you feel about those blues revival bands in the 1960s rock scene?
Well, I like the Stones just fine, but I'd say that their best material was behind them by the mid Seventies.
Any other bands you would recommend from that time?
The Pretty Things are an awesome '60s blues/rock/psychedelic band from that era. I think at one time they shared a member or two with the Stones.
So the Pretty Things were kind of covered by the British music press around the same time as the Stones, right?
Yeah, they were outraged by their defiant attitude and long hair, and their songs being about drugs.
Are there any good current blues artists out there?
I really like Jon Spencer Blues Explosion, who I would say merged blues with punk and some hip-hop influences.
