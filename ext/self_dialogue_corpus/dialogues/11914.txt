How do you think the Beatles got their name.
I think it had something to do with the fact they really liked Buddy Holly's rock and roll band the Crickets.
Yeah, they called themselves "The Silver Beetles" and later it became "The Beatles".
They were a great group. They became famous in the 1960's and changed rock and roll.
I remember seeing the girls go crazy on television around them.
I heard the girls would pull their hair and clothes just to have a small piece of them.
The girls would become so excited they would actually faint.
When did they break up?
In September 1969 John Lennon told them he was leaving the group but they did not announce it until 1970.
Well, I think they all did pretty good on their own as well.
