What is your least favorite Disney movie?
It has to be Pocohontas
Really? Why?
The story is really weak, i don't like that Pocohontas was turned into a love story where she falls in love with John Smith
But didn't you like the villan? Ratcliffe is very funny
I felt the humor from Ratcliffe and his dog to be very lacking
Well what about the songs?
I actually do like Color of the Wind
What about the other songs?
Around the River bend is catchy too
