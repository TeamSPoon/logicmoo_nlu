Have you heard the band Parquet Courts?
No, what kind of band are they?
Kinda garage rock, but a little punk.
Sounds interesting. Tell me more.
They're a New York band and put out their first album in 2011 on one of their singer's label. Since then they've put out studio albums on a variety of small labels, like Rough Trade Records.
Would I know any of their songs?
You might have heard "Human Performance", it was featured on NPR's music shows.
Are there other artists that Parquet Courts is similar to?
I hear the definite influence of seminal New York groups like the Velvet Underground and Television.
Wow, I like the Velvet Underground. How does the Velvet's influence show in Parquet Court's music.
Parquet Courts has an elevated, artistic quality that focuses on tragic elements of life. There's also a similar atonal, jangly quality to the musicianship.
Sounds interesting. I don't have a lot of time to delve into their music. What's the one song I should listen to before deciding to investigate further?
I think the best song they've recorded is called, "What Color is Blood." It's off their 2014 release Sunbathing Animal.
They do sound dark. Are they a Goth band?
No, the music is melodic, propulsive rock music.
So, their music is energetic despite the dark themes?
Yes, exactly. They're no shoe-gazing emo band. Smart and very New York.
I'll definitely try them out based on your recommendation.
You won't regret it. The best, witty, intelligent lyrics you'll find.
I think I'll like them, too.
