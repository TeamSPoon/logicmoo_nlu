This season closer game should be interesting.
Hopefully better than thier season opener.
Ouch.
It's true.
They lacked manpower this season.
How?
Two top players out for the season.
Which ones?
Alfred Wooten and Colin Pores.
Not good.
I think they'll pull through.
If thier new guys are worth it.
I think they will be.
You do?
Next season they'll be more prepared.
Will the guys come back next season?
Not sure but hopefully.
Changes happening.
Let's see how they close out.
Let's see, my friend.
