Did you like Vin Diesel's acting in The Fast and the Furious?
Yes, he played it very well.
I agree.
He plays a good tough guy.
Paul Walker was a great person to play opposite him.
I liked the way their relationship formed
They played it very well.
The filmmakers should be proud of that film.
I think so too and part 2 and 3.
The second and third one are good. I like how they take the characters and stayed true to the original.
