Whats your favorite Disney movie of all time?
Pinocchio for sure.
Why, what was so great about that movie?
Are you kidding me? It was a classic that demonstrated the struggles of a growing boy turning into an adolescent.
I heard the original was a lot darker.
Me too, I know Pinocchio kills Jepetto in the original story.
Yea but this is a Disney movie, they couldn't do that.
No way! Imagine the backlash, they are known for having happy endings.
I think that's why people watch Disney movies, to feel better about their lives.
I just find enjoyment in them.
