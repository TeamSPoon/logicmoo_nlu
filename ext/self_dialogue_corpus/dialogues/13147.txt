Who is your least favorite Star Wars character.
Jar Jar, no doubt.
He was probably the most annoying thing I've ever seen.
"Yousa thinks?"
Ha! Don't you start!
There was just no reason for him to be in the movie at all.
Except to introduce the Jedi to the Gungans.
True.
Otherwise, you're right.
Completely pointless.
