Who is the opening game of the NFL season this year?
Well, they always open with the Super Bowl winner at home, so it is Patriots and Chiefs.
Don't the Pats play the Falcons this year?
Yes, later in the season at home.
Well that was a missed opportunity! They should've opened with rematch.
I think the NFL may have done that a few years ago and the coaches didn't like it.
I'm sure ratings would've been through the roof though.
Probably. At least it wasn't the Bills or the Jets.
Yeah, for being an in-division "rival" they aren't really rivals.
Not at all. The Patriots kind of run the AFC East.
I wonder if they'd be as successful in another division?
Overall, yes, but I think if they were in a division with the Broncos that would be their one major challenge.
Why is that?
That is literally the only team against which Brady has a losing record?
Are you serious?
Yes. He's tied against Arizona, Green Bay, Giants, and Seattle, but only losing against Denver.
That is really impressive.
It is. He has a winning percentage in the high 70s. For someone who has played well over 200 games, that is amazing.
How many wins does he have?
He has 208. The most ever.
