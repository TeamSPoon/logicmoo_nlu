I like THE BREAKFAST CLUB the most.
The kids group was BRAT PACK.
They went to NEW TRIER HIGH SCHOOL.
It is a comedy.
And also coming-of-age and drama.
The 5 kids were from different cliques.
They were all in detention.
The movie received critical acclaim.
It is the greatest high school films of all time.
The movie is in the Natioal Film Registry.
It was digitally remastered.
It was re-screened in 2015.
That was it's 30th anniversary.
The kids were in all day detention.
They had to write a 1000 word essay.
Their essays were WHO YOU THINK YOU ARE.
One student was locked in a storage closet.
They smoked in the movie.
They all have bad relationships with their parents.
It is my favorite movie.
