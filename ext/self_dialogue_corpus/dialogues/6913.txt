Did you see that they're making a new Mulan movie?
Yeah, I saw that but they haven't announced all the actors.
I hope they pick a new actress for Mulan.
Agreed, they definitely need a new face for that character.
I heard that they were thinking about getting rid of her character and creating a new male character instead.
I don't like that, I hope they stick with the original storyline.
Agreed, I loved the original characters and I hope they keep the same plot.
That would be so weird if they introduced a new character.
I know, so many of the new Disney movies change around things too much.
I agree, I like when they stay with a traditional storyline.
