The term pop music covers so many kinds of music in my opinion.
Oh yeah, why do you think that?
I mean it covers things that some would consider R&B to things that people would consider borderline country.
I think that is why I like it, it is very diverse even within one genre.
My favorite singer is Taylor Swift though.
She is good. She has country roots, but flirts with an R&B sound sometimes.
She is kind of the epitome of pop music then.
She is very talented, that is for sure.
I really like some of the new songs Miley Cyrus is putting out.
Another pop artist with some country in her background.
