I finally saw the South Park movie.
Didn't that come out like 20 years ago?
Something like that.  I'm a bit behind on my movies I guess.
You don't say?
That movie was so hilarious though.  Cartman gets me every time.
What about the songs?  Those were nuts.
I feel bad if I even tried to sing them in public!
I would sing them in the shower though.
Well, yeah.  Hey, that's a good idea, I should try that.
Yes, you should!
