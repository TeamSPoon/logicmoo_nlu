Am I right in thinking that Mulan is the only Disney movie set in East Asia?
I think so. Why?
It just seems like a missed opportunity. They've gone to the Europe well a lot, but almost never to other parts of the world.
The Lion King and Tarzan took place in Africa?
Yeah, and the Jungle Book was in India.
And The Emperor's New Clothes was Peru.
So I guess they do go to other countries sometimes.
They do.
I'd still like to see more new settings though! I think it could be exciting.
I wouldn't mind it at all.
