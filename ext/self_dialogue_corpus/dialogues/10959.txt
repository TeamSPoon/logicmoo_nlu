Will the Golden Knights be good this year?
No theyre an expansion team, they never are.
Well the league is setting them up for success.
True, but theyll be able to pick from pretty much no one early on.
I agree but they can sign RFAs two weeks prior without compensation.
That is a big deal.
Who do you think theyll sign?
Have to look at Kuznetsov. He's marquee.
Yeah Washington is up against the cap.
Thats a good pun.
Wasnt trying to be funny. Do you think they get a goalie?
Yeah but it wont be anyone good.
I agree probably a teams backup
They shoud look into Steve Mason.
Philly isnt retaining him?
Hes a UFA right now and they extended Neuvirth.
Oh wow thats a shocker.
Well they eat goalies for lunch up there.
Speaking of where's Bryzgalov?
Somewhere in Russia talking about Bears.
