Do you like Aladdin?
Yes
I heard an interesting theory about it
What is that
That is could be in the future
How is that
They have magic like genies and flying carpets that could be just technology
It would be a post apocalyptic future then
It does seem to lack some modern conveniences. Also, the genie knew about some recent device despite being in the lamp for hundreds of years
That's a cool theory
