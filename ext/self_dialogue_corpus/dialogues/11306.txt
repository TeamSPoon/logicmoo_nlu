I know you're probably too young, but do you know anything about the Beetles?
Yeah, my parents used to listen to their songs when I was a kid.
Did you like their songs?
Yeah, I remember liking a few of them a lot.
Like which ones?
"Let it Be" and "Hey Jude" I liked a lot.
I liked those too, but I got sick of hearing them on the radio a lot. So I mostly like the ones that weren't as popular.
Oh really? Like which ones?
When my sisters and I were little, we used to love the song "Anna". I don't think that one ever got any air play on the radio.
The good songs usually don't.
