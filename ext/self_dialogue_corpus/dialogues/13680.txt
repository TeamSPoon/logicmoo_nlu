What is your favorite album by Lady Gaga?
Oh wow. All of them are perfect but I'm going to have to say either The Fame or The Fame Monster.
Nice! So you've been a fan from day one. So have I! What are your favorite songs from each of those albums?
I like Paparazzi from The Fame and Speechless from The Fame Monster. All of the songs are awesome though. What about you?
I like Brown Eyes from The Fame and Monster from The Fame Monster. I agree, the entire albums are epic.
Cool. I'll be happy when she has a concert near here so we can go.
I agree! That would be such a treat. I'm dying to see what amazing outfit and stage setting she will come up with.
Oh right! She is very good about those things. I dont care what anyone says, her fashion is top notch.
Indeed! Oh I have another question, what is your favorite music video from her? I think the music video for G.U.Y is awesome.
I like G.U.Y too! My favorite would probably be the Eh Eh Nothing Else I Can Say video. I loved her cute hair bow hairstyle, the Italian theme and that spaghetti in the video looked so delicious.
