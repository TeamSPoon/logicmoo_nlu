Who do you believe is the most influential rock band or musician?
Probably someone from the sixties, like Led Zeppelin or Black Sabbath.
No way, it has to be Chuck Berry.
What?  Blues isn't even rock.
Just listen to Johnny B. Goode, it's the quintessential rock and roll song.
There's not even heavy guitar or distortion, no way.  Led Zeppelin was doing that way better.
Maybe, but they did it way later.  You can't listen to something like Rock And Roll by Led Zeppelin and not hear Chuck Berry's influence.
So does the person who created the technique get the credit, or the person who refined it?
Well, that's a good question.  I'd argue the former.
I'd argue the latter.  Thankfully, we can rock out to both.
