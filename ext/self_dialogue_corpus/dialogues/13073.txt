Do you like the name Luke Skywalker?
Yes. It is a great name.
Is he your favorite character?
No. I like Yoda.
He is awesome.
I love when he meets Luke and is messing with R2-D2.
Did you like the puppet?
Yes. It was such a well made puppet. Frank Oz did a great voice for it.
It's too bad he was digital in the new one.
Yes. He looked way better as a puppet.
