Are you a fan of the Disney movie 101 Dalmations?
Yes!  It is one of my favorites.
Me too, I think the dogs are so cute in it.
I agree, I've loved it since it was a child.
Did you hear about the new movie called Cruella?
Yes, I heard it's live action too.  I just can't get into those types of movies.
Yeah, it's so weird when you see a villain in a cartoon get a backstory movie in a live action flick.
I don't like villain backstories either.
Villains shouldn't be getting sympathy.  Plus, she killed dogs for her coat!
Exactly!  It's ridiculous!
