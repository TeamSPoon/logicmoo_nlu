Do you think the NFL season should be longer?
You mean with more games?
Yeah. I think the NFL season is too short.
I think it's just about right. I don't think they can really play too many games.
Why do you say that?
Football is really taxing on the body. That's why most games have a week between them for recovery.
I think that since football players are getting paid so much money, they should play more games in a season. Plus it's more money for the league.
I personally think that there would be more injuries if footall players had to play more than 16 games.
Not really. I mean, do you see players who go deep into the playoffs getting injured more than those who get eliminated in the regular season?
I don't really know. But imagine players who go into the playoffs having to play extra games during the regular season.
I think that it wouldn't matter. I think they could do something where they have more rest time between a few games.
I guess that could work. But I personally see it being a problem with the players.
Of course it would be a problem with them. They want to make as much money without working more for it.
Do you blame them? Would you want to make the same amount of money for more work?
If I was making millions of dollars, I woudn't mind. Wouldn't you like to see the season start earlier since there isn't really much sports.Y
I wouldn't mind. But I also wouldn't want players getting injured because they are playing too much.
I just want to see more football. I think it would also give some teams more chances to get over injuries early in the season.
I think there's some pros and cons to having a longer season.
I definitely think the NFL should consider it since it means more revenue.
I would definitely watch all the games though if they did add more games.
