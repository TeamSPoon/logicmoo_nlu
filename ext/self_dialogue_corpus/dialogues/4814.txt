Hey, are you ready for the big game tomorrow?
Not really.  I need to buy a new bat.
What's wrong with your old one?
I broke it at practice yesterday.
Was it when you hit that home run?
Yeah, it cracked down the side.
That was a sweet hit though.  I hope you do that during the game.
Thanks.  I'll try.
You can use my bat for practice today.
Alright.  What brand is it?
It's a Louisville Slugger.
Nice!  My old bat was a Louisville.
I've had them since i was little.  My dad always bought them for me.
Yeah, my grandfather bought me my first one.
They are my favorite bat.  I've tried so many others.
Same here.  There's nothing like a Louisville.
What type of glove do you use?
I have a Wilson.
Mine is an Rawlings.
Cool!  Let me check it out.
