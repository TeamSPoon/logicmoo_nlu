What is your favorite genre of music?
I really like rap, what's your favorite?
I like classical music, a bit different than rap wouldn't you say?
Yeah they are very different but I think rap is very artful if done right?
oh yeah? I never thought of it as art honestly.
If the beat is perfect and the lyrics are clever, the song becomes an instant classic!
Can you tell me some songs that are tasteful in the rap genre?
You can listen to Not Afraid by Eminem, it has a lot of heart in it!
What do you mean by that?
Eminem really spills his heart about his drug addictions and how he overcame them
Oh that is amazing. I will listen to it later!
What can you tell me about classical music?
It's harder to explain, everything just has to be perfect.
I don't know much about music so it's harder to appreciate for me
Why do you say that?
I don't understand how the melodies and harmonics work out
I learned a lot of it in school, I was in band
Oh that's cool. It makes me feel like I should find music from other genres and see what I can learn
Take some classes and you will be amazed what you learn!
I will try to learn more about music online to appreciate your tastes!
