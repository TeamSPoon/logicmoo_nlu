I just Saw the new Star Wars movie Rogue One.
How did you like it?
I loved it and was glad to buy it on DVD.
I saw it when it came out at the movie theater.
I think it's great that they are spinning off of the original for new story lines.
I think so too. It will make the series so much richer.
It will also allow for endless possibilities.
The characters were memorable.
I think so too and I like how they did the back story to Leia and the ships map.
It makes the original make more sense.
