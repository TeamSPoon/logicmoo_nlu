Are you going to watch the Boston vs. Cleveland game tonight?
Yea, I wanted to. What time is it on?
It's at 8:30pm EST.
Ok, cool. Who do you think will win?
I think Cleveland will, now that Isaiah Thomas is out.
Yea, and the way they lost in Game 2 was so bad.
Yes, and I feel like Lebron James is in the zone.
Even when they are up he is still looking ahead and trying to do better.
I agree, I wonder who will start for Boston?
I don't know but I don't think it will matter.
True, I guess we'll see tonight!
Can't wait! When's the next game?
Golden State plays San Antonio on Monday.
I wish they would skip to the finals already. It's going to be a great series.
So you think Cleveland and Golden State?
Yea, it's pretty much guaranteed.
How did Lebron finish fourth in the MVP race?
They get enamored with statistics.
Yea but there's more to it than just triple doubles.
We're seeing it play out in the playoffs!
