Did you know Shania Twain has a new song?
No way! Tell me about it!
It's called "It's About to Get Good."
How is it?
I like it a lot. It reminds me of her older stuff.
What are your favorite Shania songs?
I like Any Man of Mine and Man, I Feel Like a Woman.
Those are great. I like You're Still The One and From This Moment.
Those are great romantic songs.
Who are some of your other favorite females in country music?
I love Faith Hill.
Oh, me too! I wish she was still making solo music.
Me too. I think she and Tim McGraw still tour together though.
I think you are correct. They are great together.
They have amazing duets. They have a new one I think.
Yeah! It's called "Speak To A Girl."
What do you think of it?
It's okay. Nothing can really top their best duets like "It's Your Love" and "I Need You."
Those are their absolute best.
"Meanwhile Back At Mamas" is fairly recent and also great.
