Are you ready for some football?
Yes I am!
The first game is September 7th.
Who is playing?
The Chiefs versus the Patriots.
That should be an interesting matchup.
The Super Bowl champion Patriots will be looking to repeat.
They are an amazing franchise for sure.
They are, but I do like the Chiefs organization.
Me too. I think Andy Reid is a good coach.
He had a nice run with the Eagles and McNabb.
Those were some great years if you were and Eagles fan.
For sure, but they never got the big one!
That is true.
What are the Eagles chances this year?
I think they will be better, especially Carson Wentz.
Yes he should imporve from last year.
I think their defense was lacking last season.
You need a good defense to compete with all of the crazy offenses in the NFL.
Or you have to just outscore the other teams.
