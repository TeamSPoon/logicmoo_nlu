Whats your favorite disney animated movie?
Oh, probably one of the classics, like Snow White.
Really, I like something a little more modern, like Lion King.
That is a good story, and they did such an amazing job with the animation.
I know, I love the story but I also love how beautiful the film is.
When I went to the animal kingdom I went on the safari ride and it reminded me of the movie.
But you still perfer Snow White.
Yes, and I loved the new seven dwarfs roller coaster they have at Disneyworld.
I wish they would do something like that for Lion King.
Well, they did turn it into a Broadway show, so they have that.
