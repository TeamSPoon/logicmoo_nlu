Did you see the game last night with the Bulls?
No I didn't.  Who were they playing?
They were playing the Celtics.
Oh, I love the Boston team.  Sorry I missed it.
It was a pretty good game, fairly evenly matched all night.
So, who pulled it out in the end?
The Bulls got a three pointer right at the buzzer.
Great, those kind of finishes are always exciting.
I know, I was screaming waiting for the ball to drop it.
Bet you woke up the house when you did that.
No, my family is used to me getting excited when I am watching basketball.
Are there any games on tonight?
Yes, the Bulls are playing the New York team tonight.
That should be a good game.  Isn't the New York team in first place at the moment?
No, they lost last night by a lot to the Lakers.
Used to love the Lakers years back.  They have had some great players.
I know.  The Bulls are the same way - a great history of players.
Still miss MIchael Jordan, huh?
You bet, and Scottie Pippen too.
Somebody new will rise to the top for the Bulls.  You'll see.
