Do you remember roseanne?
As in roseanne bar?
Yes, I forget she even has a last name.. she is like cher or madonna in that way .. to me.
Well of course I know and recall roseanne.
Did you ever see her film she-devil?
No I don't think so. What was it about?
It was about a housewife with kids cheating husband.
Seems like the depressing life of many.
It is actually really funny and fun.
Really how so?
Well meryl streep is also in it she is a romance novelist.
I love meryl. Now you have me really intrigued.
She plays the other woman. Really funny performance by both women.
Well I will have to check it out.Anyone else I would know?
Maybe the husband, Ed Begley Jr.
I don't know him but sounds worth checking out.
It is, I mean it is a kind of  80's cheesy but good cheese.
Just the kind I can sink my teeth into!
haha! Judging from that line I think you would enjoy this film for sure.
Roseanne has some good comedy specials if you haven't seen them, do!
