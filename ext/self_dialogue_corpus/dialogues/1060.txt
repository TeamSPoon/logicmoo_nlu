Who do you think will be the best NFL running back this year?
Ezekiel Elliott will be the best running back for sure.
No way, he is too young and inexperienced, maybe in a few years.
He may be young, but I think even though he is young he still has a lot of talent.
You are just saying that because you went to Ohio State and are loyal to their football players.
True, I am loyal, but I honestly think that he is one of the best out there. His abilities are second to none.
What about Leâ€™Veon Bell of the Pittsburgh Steelers?
Sure, he has the most average yards per carry, but he doesn't have the skills that Elliott has. Plus he's been injured recently.
What skills does Elliott have that are so impressive?
Ezekiel Elliott is fast, no one can catch him.
Well it takes more than that, you have to be strong, and have experience.
Elliott is also very quick, have you seen how he can navigate through a tiny opening right down the middle?
He has a good team backing him up, so it is not all of his ability.
Eliott can jump over players, even when they are standing up. That is all his own ability.
I will admit that he has some incredible ups, but jumping alone won't do it, this isn't basketball.
True, but it makes him exciting to watch.
You don't win football games just by being exciting.
Maybe not, but the crowd loves it, and the energy helps them to win, so maybe it helps.
Well we'll just have to see, my money is on Bell, you keep rooting for your Buckeye guy.
I will, and my guy will jump right over your guy for the win.
