Maybe it's just me, the The Sixth Sense is so overrated.
I wouldn't say overrated, just not as memorable as most think.
It's really just a twist ending and that's about it.
The rest of the movie is kind of forgettable.
And super slow.  How would he not know he's dead?
Yeah, I agree.
And doesn't he take showers?  Go to bed?  How would he not know he's bleeding?
It doesn't make sense if you really start thinking about it.
So a neat trick at the end, but not plausible.
That would be accurate.
