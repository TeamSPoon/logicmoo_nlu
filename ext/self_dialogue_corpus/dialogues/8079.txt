What genres make up pop music?
I think any genre can end up being pop music?
What do you mean?
It's called "cross over". If a track is huge within a genre, it will leave the genre and become pop music.
I see, but what genres are most likely to generate pop hits?
I'd say most pop music comes from the country, dance, Latin, urban, and rock genres.
What makes a track, as you say, cross over?
I think it's how catchy the track is. Some of these pop hits are addictive.
I know what you mean. I can't get them out of my head!
Yes, that's called the "hook". Most pop music has a hook which catches your attention.
