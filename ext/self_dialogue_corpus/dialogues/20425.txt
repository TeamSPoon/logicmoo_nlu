Man, sometimes I just want to leave this planet.
There are movies for that.
Can you give me some of them?
Have you ever seen Dark City?
Yes I have. I felt like I was being abducted by aliens while I watched that.
I think that was their intent. You should see the movie Southland Tales.
Tell me about that. It sounds interesting.
Have you ever seen Donnie Darko? The guy who made that made Southland Tales.
I have seen that movie. Are any of the same people in Southland Tales?
No, they got new people, but there is a great ensemble cast.
Tell me about some of the people in it.
Sean William Scott, The Rock, and Sarah Michelle Geller are all in it.
That is so random! What is this movie about?
It is about the world ending. I almost forgot that Justin Timberlake narrates it.
I love Justin Timberlake! Who is he in the movie?
He plays a marine. He goes into some very deep thoughts.
This sounds like a cool movie. So it's about the world ending, is that it?
Yes, that is about it. It is a pretty free form movie.
Those are my favorite kinds. So it is more designed to stretch your brain out as opposed to telling you a story.
You nailed it. Check this movie out soon.
