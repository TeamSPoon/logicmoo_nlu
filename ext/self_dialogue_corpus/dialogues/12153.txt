Are you excited to see the next Star Wars?
Very.
When is it coming out?
December 2017.
That's cool.  Will you stay up and see the first showing?
Probably not.  I'm worried about movie theater related shootings.
There's a new trailer out.
I like the island where they shot the scene with Rey and Luke.
Old Luke Skywalker looks good with a beard.
I agree.  I need to get me one of those robes.
