Did you happen to catch "Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them?"
I did, but I'm not sure if I liked it. It was just so different from the other "Harry Potter" films.
Well, you have to expect that. It's a different time, setting, characters, story, everything.
Yeah but it didn't feel the same for me, like they were part of the same world.
Really? I thought it did. I thought the acting was so great and the story was very charming.
I hear they're going to make more.
Yeah, supposedly five more are on the way.
Five?! I hope they don't get all weird like "Transformers" or "Pirates of the Caribbean."
I don't think they will. There is good source material.
Have they named any new cast members?
Yeah, obviously Eddie Redmayne and Johnny Depp are in it, but they've also cast Jude Law as Dumbledore.
Oh wow, I can't even imagine. That's a big change from what we're used to.
Well, he's a lot younger in this.
So are they going to tell how he got the Elder Wand?
Maybe. I'm pretty sure that'll be part of it since Johnny Depp is coming back as Grindelwald, and that's who he got it from.
Are they going to bring in any of the original cast?
I doubt it. None of them were really alive back then.
That's too bad. I think it would be good to have that connection.
I disagree. I like that it's the same world but all new people, or somewhat new.
To each his own then.
