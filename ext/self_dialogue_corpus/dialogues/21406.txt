What is your favorite genre of movie?
I really like Science Fiction and Fantasy movies!
Oh really? Me too, I love the Lord of the Rings movies!
Those are some of the best movies, which one is your favorite?
I like the Return of the King, except it is so long!
Yeah I agree, watching the extended edition it one sitting is pretty brutal.
Yeah, it takes up all night just to watch it.
So what other movies do you like?
I really like John Wick and its sequel, John Wick Chapter 2!
Those movies are so cool, Reeves is almost as good as he was in the first Matrix movie.
Yeah, the first Matrix is one of my favorite all-time movies.
It was so cool, I remember being blown away by it when it first came out.
If only they would have left it alone, or actually made sequels that made sense.
I don't hate all of the sequels, but I do agree they were not on par with the original.
That is usually the case with most movies, can you think of an exception where the sequel was better?
Aliens was better than Alien in my opinion.
They tie for me, Alien was more of a horror movie, and Aliens was more of a action movie.
Yeah, but we can both agree Alien 3 was horrible.
You got me there, I don't know what they were thinking with that movie.
Ripley was such a cool character though!
