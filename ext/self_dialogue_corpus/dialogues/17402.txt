What do you think of Rap as a whole.
I think Rap hits home to the lower class the struggling family and mostly the kids of those families.
How so?
Well a lot of what rap is about is speaking the truth and saying it in a public way.
Do you think rap is misunderstood?
I think it was at one point but not anymore.
I remember the 90s when it was just becoming it's own the public thought it was wrong.
Not the kids or the younger generation though.
They saw it for what it really was the real world that nobody would speak about.
I think Rap as a whole has improved our world and brought a light on the darkness that was hidden for so long.
I can't agree more especially on police corruption and the poor life in general.
I'm glad Rap has progressed beyond what it was at first.
I do too that was a scary time for everyone.
I'm glad it also survived and thrived.
If it wasn't for rappers like N.W.A, Eminem, Biggie, Tupac i'm not sure if it would have.
Tupac was iconic and not just because of his death the man preached good while speaking the truth.
He was what Rap embodied in spirit.
That's very true I just wish he had lived long enough to see the world now and so he could show us more of his music.
I can only imagine what he could have created.
He was a genius.
