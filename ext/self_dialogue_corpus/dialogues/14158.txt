How many albums have lada gaga published to date?
not sure, I feel she's not as famous as she was few years ago, so I lost track
I feel the same, her poker face album was perhaps the most famous one
yea, back then, I heard them being played everywhere on the street
such a sensation, isn't it
yeah, recently she published another album called JOANNE, I think it's good as well
so what song should I listen to first if I get the album?
Grigio Girls
why is that
I think she dedicated that song to her best friends, it has soul in it.
