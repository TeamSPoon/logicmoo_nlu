I just saw the movie A Separation.
I never heard of it.
It's set in Iran, about a divorce and child custody.
Sounds cool.  A lot of burkas?
No, just hijabs.
What happens in the movie?
A woman wants to divorce her husband.  They fight over custody of their daughter, who is about 14.
Was the husband a bad guy?
No, it wasn't a black and white matter. The husband is actually quite decent.
And the wife?
She's not bad, either.  This isn't a cut and dry anti-Muslim movie.
Cool. Where does it take place?
Some city in Iran. Lots of cars and modern conveniences.
Neat.  How's the daughter?
Plain, but nice.  The wife is a knock out.
Even in a hijab?
Yes, even with the hijab.
What happens in the end?
They go see a judge and the girl gets to decide.
Wow, not what I expected.
