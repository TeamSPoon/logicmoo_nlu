Did you see that Moana was added to Netflix?
I didn't! I never got to see it in theaters.
I recommend it, it's pretty good.
I really liked Lilo and Stitch, is Moana kind of like that?
Sort of. They have similar locations.
I did really love the setting of Lilo and Stitch. It's not one you see often in movies.
Moana has a completely different story though.
I bet with Disney it's good no matter what.
Yeah, it's heartwarming like you'd expect.
I'll have to watch it later with my family.
