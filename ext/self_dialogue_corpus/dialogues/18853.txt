I had a really hard Guitar Lesson today!
Oh yeah, How so?
My teacher taught me a new fingering technique.
Which one did you learn?
We worked on learning to slide my fingers down the strings after plucking to change the pitch higher or lower.
I wouldn't think that was so hard.
It is difficult to do accuratly when you are moving through a peice and need to move on to the next notes.
Doesn't the neck of your guitar have those lines to help you?
The fret marks? Yes it does but you need to press cleanly in the space so that the note plays true on the one long string vibration.
Sort of like when you play a larger string instrument like the cello?
Exactly, if you don't move your fingers to the right places on the neck the end notes won't be true.
Oh, I understand now.
It's also hard on your fingers to hold the string down and slide.
I've seen some guitar players use metal tubes on their fingers to slide like that.
That is another techniques that will play sliding cords but for individual notes you only use your bare fingers.
Do your fingertip calluses help?
They do but it looks like I'll need to practice more to build them up a bit.
I've heard those sliding notes and didn't know how they were done.
It's a great technique to add to my playing.
I look forward to hearing you play a whole peice!
