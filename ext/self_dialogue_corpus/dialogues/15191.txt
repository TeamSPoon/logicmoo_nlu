My son is in need of a new tuba.
Aren't we all?
Cut the jokes. What am I looking to pay.
Well, I need to know a few things.
Ask away.
How old is he, how serious is he about it?
He's 17 and going to college for music education, and already has a performance and academic scholarship.
Nice! Congrats to him.
Thanks! He wants to be a band director some day.
Okay, so looks like he's serious and won't need a 'school' instrument.
Yeah, something professional but not too expensive.
Do you know if he wants rotary or piston valves?
Which sounds better?
They sound the same. The only real differences are appearance and that rotary springs back faster, but it's not noticeable, really.
Probably rotary then.
Silver, nickel, or brass finish?
Brass, for sure.
CC or Bbb tuning?
Whatever is most common.
For him, probably a Bbb tuba. Try a St. Petersburg 202N, it's a bit under $4,000.
