How do you feel about Lady Gag?
Do you mean her clothes or her music?
Her music!
Oh, I love her music. I think she's super talented.
I totally agree. Do you feel differently about her clothing?
I just think it's too much. I don't think she needs all that costuming.
I think it's an expression of who she is.
Her music does that on it's own! Have you heard any of her acoustic stuff?
I don't think I have.
I love it. You should check out her playing piano and singing "Marry the Night".
