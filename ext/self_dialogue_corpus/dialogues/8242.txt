Do you agree that  Michael Jackson was the king of pop?
Yes 100% he was the king of pop.
So my question is who is the queen of pop then?
Hard to say if there is one, he kind of created pop in a way. Not sure any females made the same impact on the music world.
No one can or will ever be as  great an influence on pop music. But who would you crown?
Maybe Taylor Swift. She always is winning lots of awards.
But her start was in country. I don't think she should be queen of pop.
Well Michael started with his brothers in Motown and became King of pop.
That is a good point you make. Maybe she could deserve the title then... but I say lady gaga is a better choice.
I had not consider GAGA.She may be more of a pop princess.
