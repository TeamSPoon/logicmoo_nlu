Have you heard the new Drake album?
No, not the whole thing.
Drake at the Billboard awards concert at Bellagio was insane.
That song was from his new album, damn!
Yeah, that song is called "Galchyster".
That's a weird name, not sure what that means.
I don't either, but the track is fire!
Agreed, I should take a listen to it.
The flow of his album is a bit different than his usual.
Why? He change his style?
A little bit, it feels like reggae sort of.
That's weird, I don't know if I'll like that though.
Just have a listen to it, the album together makes sense and does sound good.
I will, especially after "Fake Love" and "Galchyster".
Are you listening to anything new?
Nah, not really, just vibing to older stuff.
Like what?
Fort Minor, some stuff from high school like Nelly, stuff like that.
Oh, I really liked them a while ago, I should listen again.
Yeah, been liking that stuff recently.
