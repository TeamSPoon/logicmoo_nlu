Hey man did you get your Saints season tickets in the mail yet?
I sure did. The 2017 tickets look amazing, I love the new deisgn.
Same here brotha! I hope your pretty pumped about getting to go to London for the October 1st game.
Dude you have no idea. Kinda wish we were playing a better team though.
Eh it's whatever. The Doplhins suck but it's just going to be cool to expierence an NFL game overseas.
Hopefully beers don't cost $9 like they do in the Superdome.
Haha I hate that so much. Do you remember the Saints/Raiders game last season when that guy infront of us bought like 20 beers?
Ofcourse I remember that, I also remember how bad of a game that was for us.
It was very close game just like half of the games last season.
Our defense sucks so bad, I'm really losing hope that we will win another SuperBowl.
Gotta have faith man, gotta have faith.
How more years do think Drew Brees has left?
Most likely 2 or 3 but who knows, he could get hurt before that.
He said he wants to retire as a New Orleans Saint so I have faith in that.
Drew Brees is our only hope to win another championship.
We did draft a bunch of defensive players in the draft this year.
I wasn't too impressed with some of our later 5 and 6th picks but overall I thought Mikey Loomis did okay.
Yeah same. I think Sean Payton is making most calls in regards to drafting. Loomis is just a front.
Ha. I wouldn't doubt it but you gotta give Sean Payton some credit, he's a genius and a great coach.
He really is. It sucks knowing Brees and Payton will gone one day.
