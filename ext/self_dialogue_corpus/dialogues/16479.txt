Did you hear that Steven Tyler is releasing a Country album?
No way!
That's what I heard. I've yet to verify.
That would be so weird.
My thought exactly.
I wish Aerosmith would do another album. Not Country!
I'm with you. I really like that band.
I liked their ealiest stuff best.
That always seems to be the way with those old rockers.
Although, I did like their foray into Hip Hop.
What?
Yeah, Walk this Way?
That wasn't Hip Hop.
Well, not the original.
Did they rerecord it?
Yeah, how do you not know this.
Must have burried my head in the sand!
Yeah, they did it with Run DMC.
I remeber those guys.
Weren't the 80's grand!
