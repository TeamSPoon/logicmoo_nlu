What's the most unusual place you've ever seen a Disney movie?
For me, that's easy. At DisneyWorld.
What movie did you see at DisneyWorld?
"The Lion King."
Was this in the park, or what?
No, at the hotel. We were staying in a Disney hotel and they had a small cafeteria area and there was a big screen TV in there and they were just starting Lion King when I got there. Sat there and watched the whole thing.
That's kind of cool.
Yes, it was. It's one of my better stories about Disney movies.
Got another one?
Honestly, no. Guess it's my only story.
