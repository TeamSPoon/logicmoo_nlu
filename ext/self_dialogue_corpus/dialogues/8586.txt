Did you know Foo Fighters is releasing a new album??
No! I didn't know that, I love them...glad you told me about this.
I figured you may want to know since you love Dave Grohl so much.
I know, I've been a fan since his Nirvana days.
Don't you wish 90's rock style were still being made??
Definitely. That era of rock is my absolute favorite. Rage Against the Machine started then too.
Now that is a great band, I should have gone to see them when I had the chance.
I've seen them live once, one of the best shows of my life.
I'm so jealous!! I didn't know they would split up.
Maybe they'll do a reunion show one day. I would definitely go see them again.
