Abbey road is the last album where all 4 beatles were part of the recording.
well, that should be the case, but they released Let it be after Abbey Road.
But Let it be was all recorded before Abbey Road.
That's what I'm saying It should considered the group's last recorded album.
But it's not because the record company messed up.
I don't know if they messed up or intended all along.
Either way it's stupid. Abbey Road IS the last album
Well at least the latest recordings from the Beatles.
And that's all that matters.
At least both albums are good.
