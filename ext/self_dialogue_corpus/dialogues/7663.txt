I really enjoyed when they shared Snape's backstory.
Ya I liked that too I didn't realize he had a crush on Harry's mom.
Ya and he made it his goal to to protect her.
Once you see that part it really gives you a new perspective on Snape.
I totally agree. I started to question where his loyalty was up until then.
So did I but I felt the backstory really answers a lot of the questions I had.
I wish Harry Potter had gotten to know more about Snape while he was alive.
Ya I agree if Snape hadn't of been living a double life.
Ya I'm sure it was difficult for him to try and play two sides with Voldemort.
Ya I think that's a good point.
