Who is your favorite player in the NFL?
My favorite player is Matthew Stafford.
Really? Why?
He's a great player.
The lions aren't even that good.
That doesn't make him any less of a great player.
I'm not too sure about that.

Being humble doesn't make someone a great player.
He always puts his team first, he always gives the game his everything.

Do you have other favorite players?
Sure, I have a lot of them.
