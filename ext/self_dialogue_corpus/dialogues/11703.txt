I met someone today who was so far out there I think he could've written songs for the Beatles.
What do you mean?
Well you know how some of the Beatles lyrics are hard to make sense of, or they don't seem to mean anything at all?
I don't think so. I thought mostly they did love songs and things like that.
They've done love songs and they've done just some far out there songs.
Examples?
Like Maxwell's Silver Hammer and Octupus's Garden come to mind.
I thought Maxwell's Silver Hammer was kind of morbid, didn't you?
Not especially. I always just found it amusing and lighthearted.
It seems like just the kind of song you'd like.
