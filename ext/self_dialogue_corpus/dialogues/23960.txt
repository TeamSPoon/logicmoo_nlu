Do you like the latest Harry Potter movie
which one?
Fantastic Beasts and where to Find them
I have not seen that one yet
It is out on video if you want to rent it
I liked the 1st 2 Potter films but became disinterested with the rest
that could be because they changed directors after the first 2
I cant even remember the name of those
The Sourcers Stone, and The Chamber of Secrets
thats right I remember now
This last film is tied in but is also a stand alone
is it about Harry as he ages?
no it is a prequal to all of the previous movies
Oh that sounds interesting
it is good
is it about wizards
yes but more about how it all started
I will rent that very soon
the special effects are great
sounds interesting
