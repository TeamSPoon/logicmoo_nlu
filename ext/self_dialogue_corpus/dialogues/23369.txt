We saw the remake of the Magnificent Seven on dvd recently.
Cool.  You like westerns?
Some yeah.
That's alright.  Who was in it.
Some big name guys, Denzel Washington and Chris Pratt.
I like them.  Wasn't there another movie with the same name?
Right.  From the sixties I think.
Who was in that one.
Let's see - Yul Brynner and Steve McQueen is who I remember.
So you saw that one.
Oh yeah.  Its maybe the best, with famous music.
I think I know that song.
So the Yul Brynner/Denzel Washington character rounds up seven guys to protect a town.
Sounds like a basic western.
And Chris Pratt/ Steve McQueen provide a light touch.
I can see that.
But there's a lot of shooting and killing.
What a surprise.
And most of the seven die.  Its funny and sad.
I'll try to see it sometime.
