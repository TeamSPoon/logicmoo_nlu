Hi
Hi, do you like fashion?
Yes I try and stay on top of the latest trends.
Me too, I just bought another romper.
Oh, I love rompers, I have one in black with pink flowers on it.
The one I just got is white, I love it. I got matching sandals too.
That sounds cute, I've been wanting a white romper.
I just got a pair of skinny jeans, with holes in them too, from Hollister.
I love their jeans, I have so many from there.
I prefer to wear summer dresses and rompers in the summertime.
I always wear jeans, sandals, and tank tops. It's my favorite fashion statement.
That sounds cute, I do it when I got out, but not all the time.
Sometimes I wear leggins, with a tunic, when I want to look cute, but comfortable.
I love leggings, I'm pretty sure I have a pair in every color.
I only have black and brown. I don't like the pattern ones.
I like them. I have these camp leggings and I have a super cute black shirt that I wear with them.
That sounds like it looks good. I wanted to get a geometric design once, but I couldn't find a shirt I liked with them.
To pull it off it has to be a solid color shirt, it can't have anythng on it
Yea, I have trouble finding solid color shirts I like.
I have a pink pattern leggings and I wear a solid white shirt. Love it.
