My son has a ball game tonight.
Oh, he's still playing?
Yeah, this is his fourth year.
What position is he playing this year?
They tried letting him pitch at the beginning of the season, but that didn't work out.
Oh, yeah?  Didn't go over well?
Well, he didn't do so bad, but there's another kid that does much better.
Oh, well where is he playing now?
He's in the outfield.
Does he like playing there?
Oh, he loves it, and he's actually a lot better in the outfield than he was pitching.
So it all worked out?
Oh, yeah.  He'd rather catch flies than worry about throwing strikes anyhow.
How is he batting?
Not bad at all.  He actually had a home run and a triple his last game.
Wow, it sounds like you've got a star on your hands!
Yeah, he's pretty talented to be honest.
It sounds like it!
I'm just glad that he gets a chance to spend time doing something he loves.
Yeah, it's great when kids love sports.
