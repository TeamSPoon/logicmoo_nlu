I really hope that we get to the Super Bowl this year.
Yes, I really want to face the Patriots go avenge what happened in 2015.
That interception is still on my mind.
Yes, the Seahawks had that Super Bowl wrapped up, I cannot believe that they called a pass play.
Well next time that won't happen, next time we will win.
I totally agree, we are going to take it if we get back against them.
It does suck that Marshawn isn't on the team anymore though.
Yeah, but I get that he wanted to go home to Oakland.
But aren't they moving to Vegas anyway?
Yes, but they'll still be in Oakland next season.
Yeah, that's right, he does still get to play in front of his hometown crowd.
Yes, but I would have loved it if he was the one to run it into the end zone during the rematch.
Oh that would be really good.
Yes, we should also have a pretty easy road to winning the division too.
As long as we stay relatively healthy we will be good.
Easier said than done.
Tell me about it, we will have to hope the key guys can stay on the field.
Yes also hoping for some of the young players to emerge.
I am sure some will take the stage.
Yes, well we should definitely hit up a game when you have time.
