What was your favorite movie in the Star Wars franchise?
Definitely Return of the Jedi.
That was a good one. Why is it your favorite?
I know it's dumb, but I really liked the Ewoks. Plus, it's the third in the series, and it wraps up well at the end.
I like the Ewoks too! But honestly, I like Empire Strikes Back.
Empire was good. Why was it your favorite?
I really like how they gave Princess Leia a little more airtime in that movie.
Very true, she didn't get as much attention as she should have.
I like how the newer movies give more attention to the female characters.
Me too! I can't wait for Episode 8.
