who would win in a fight darth vader or darth maul?
Darth Vader for sure!
I don't know. Darth Maul is one strong sith.
Maul may have a two sided light saber but that doesn't even begin to compare to the power of darth vader.
So you think Darth Vader is the ultimate power of the dark side?
Yes, how can you not agree?
Well what about the emperor dosen't he have more power than darth vader?
I don't think so at all. I think he is in a higher position to a degree, but darth vader is the stronger power hands down.
Maybe not sure 100%. I would have liked to see those two fight it out.
I still think Vader rules all. Would be neat to see a vader versus maul then winner versus the emperor fight scene.
