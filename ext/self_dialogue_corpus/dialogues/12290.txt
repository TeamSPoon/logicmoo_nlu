So what did you think of Attack of the Clones?
I'm a little so so on it.  What about you?
It was better than Episode I but still a bit behind the other movies.
Yeah, I know.  Count Dukoo was cool though.
Yeah, Christopher Lee plays a good bad guy.
It was awesome to see someone that was a Padiwan for Yoda himself.
It was, that was a great display of Jedi heritage.
I know, Yoda trained Dukoo, who trained Qui Con, who trained Obi Wan, who trained Anikan.
Obi Wan and Yoda also both trained Luke.
Yeah, but that breaks the chain a bit and was much later.
