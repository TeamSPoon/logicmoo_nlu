Do you think Philadelphia will make the playoffs next year
I don't know they have a lot of unanswered questions at goalie
This is very true. They have some formidable lines though
I think having the second overall draft pick is huge for the franchise
It could be but they've shown in the past they don't draft well
Actually they have drafted well the problem is is they treat their draft picks a lot.
I agree they miss use them but I think this year is can't miss
I may need to change head coaches their coach came from college
They need to get better play out of their captain
Their defense got better as the year went on.
They have a lot of rookies and young guys coming up from the minors
And always comes back to the goalie it seems
They haven't had one in years.
They haven't had one in years.
I think the last time they had a good solid goaltender was 1998
Maybe but they missed the playoffs too much to keep messing around
The one time they did go get a goalie was the Russian guy and he wasn't very good
I think the cities too hard on their goalies and he got swallowed up in their intensity
You deathly have to have thick skin to playing at Philadelphia
Well it hasn't worked out in decades
