What's your favorite music genre?
I really like rap
Isnt that all about women and drugs?
not at all it's about struggling through life
Oh thats a cool perspective
anything else you like?
I like techno music
I like it too. it makes me want to dance
yeah plus it doesnt have many words
that way theres no cussing
true! one genre I really dont get is country
yeah i dont get it either
its just talking about farming and stuff
pretty boring to me!
my dad loves it and listened to it in my childhood, i hated it
maybe someday our kids will hate our music
it will be weird to be 70 and listening to rap
thats how it always goes!
what do you mean
kids dont understand their parents music!
