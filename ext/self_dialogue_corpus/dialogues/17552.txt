Have you heard Megadeth's new album?
No. I didn't know they released one this year.
Yeah. It's called Dystopia. I saw them on the Grammy's last night.
That's cool. Did they win?
Yeah, but get this. They played Master of Puppets as they accepted the award!
No way. They played a Metallica song for a Megadeth win.
And Dave said it was the worst version of Master of Puppets he's ever heard. Ha Ha. It's true!
Poor Dave Mustaine. First he gets kicked off Metallica then they play a Metallica song at his Grammy night.
Megadeth's album is very good. Lots of guitar and double bass. Poisonous Shadows is my favorite song.
Didn't they hire a new guitarist.
Kiko Loureiro. He replaced Chris Broderick when he quit.
That's right. Still, my favorite Megadeth guitarist has to be Marty Friedman.
I'm with you there. Rust in Peace, Countdown to Extinction and Youthanasia are my favorite Megadeth albums.
I have to give props to Chirs. Have you seen his Betcha Can't PLay This on Youtube?
No?
He plays these figures on the guitar like it was a piano. He was tapping on the strings super fast.
What do you mean like a piano?
Instead of having his fingers go under the neck, he moves up and down and over the neck. He taps each string like it was a piano.
Oh, I kind of get what you saying. Chris is a talented guitar player.
Definately. But I still like Marty Friedman more.
