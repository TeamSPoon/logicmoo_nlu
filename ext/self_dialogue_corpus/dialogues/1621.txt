So what do you think about Colin Kaepernick?
An emotional adolescent who has lived a spoiled life.
And low IQ.
Yes, low IQ, and full of ignorance.
Any chance he plays anywhere this year?
No flippin' way. This is a business.
You darn right it's a business.
Yes, when you continually disrespect your employer and the organization that your employer belongs to then you get fired.
That is 100% correct sir.
Hey, what do you think about Goodell?
Well, he's an overpaid CEO but I don't have any issue with that.
So what's his problem?
He is too tolerant in reference to shenanigans. He chooses media attention over his customer base.
I couldn't agree with you more.
If you think about it though, do you really care about this stuff?
No, not really.
I mean some of it aggravates me, but the product that is produced is awesome every single week.
The NFL is an awesome entity.
Yes, it certainly is.
May God bless American football.
