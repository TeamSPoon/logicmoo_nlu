I like the group Chicago. How about you?
I like the newer stuff and by newer I mean the 80's newer.
Oh right because they had music in the 70's.
Yeah the 70's stuff or some of it is not pleasing to my ear.
There are so many songs that I love.
I love Will You Still Love Me.
Peter Cetera had such an amazing voice.
Yes, but some songs, even with him singing were bad.
I don't like 25 or 6 to 4.
That one is literally about time on a clock.
I know. I like the idea, just not the melody so much.
Hard to Say I'm Sorry is another so I really like.
Who took over for Peter Cetera when he left?
I think Jason Scheff. He does bass also.
That first album was Chicago 18.
Yeah that was a great album. But I like Chicago 19 better.
Heart in Pieces was great.
I Don't Want to Live Without Your Love is my favorite one.
I think they still tour.
Oh really we should try and catch them.
