What was the first cd you purchased?
Green day ,Dookie!
wow, great first purchase.
It is still so vivid in my mind. I can even see the sticker warning on it.
HA, that is funny.
I can also clearly see the cover art.
It is quite iconic in it's image. So 90s.
I feel like green day and nirvana were the best bands from that time.
They were both great.
Kurt Cobain was amazing.
Agreed, sad about him, gone way too soon.
Yes I wish he was still with us.
Well dave grohl is still kicking and amazing.
True, my friend is a huge dave fan.
I am too!
She is like hard core fan. Got him to draw random image on her arm and got it tattooed on her.
Really? What did he draw?
yes really!It is on her forearm and it is a little monster with his signature.
Interesting and very unique.
She got it in red too, very one of a kind.
