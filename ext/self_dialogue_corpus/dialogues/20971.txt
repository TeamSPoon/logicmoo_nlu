Have you seen the Indiana Jones movies before?
Yes I have. The third one is my favorite.
I liked the first one the most.
The first one had a lot of action in it.
Yeah it did. It's why it's my favorite one.
The second Indiana Jones movie was a bit stale for my taste.
I agree. They could have had a better plot with it.
Some of the scenes were too cheesy.
I only saw that movie a couple of times. I don't think I'll watch it again.
Yeah, I think it deserves to stay on the shelf.
The other Indiana Jones movies are still great.
Agreed. The third one has a lot of story behind it.
I like how they took out a tank in that movie.
That scene was great. Lots of action!
Remember the part at the end?
Yeah I do. I remember they found the cup and the temple was destroyed.
Do you think they will make any more Indiana Jones movies?
There are rumors that another one is being made with Harrison Ford again.
That would be awesome to see.
I can't wait for it to come out!
