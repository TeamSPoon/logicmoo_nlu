I was listening to the radio today and heard that Disney costumes are the most popular halloween costumes these days.
I believe it! Last year my boyfriend and I went as Meg and Hercules from Hercules!
What a small world, that is what my sister and her husband are doing this year! And their new baby will be dressed as Phil!
That is hilarious!
Come to think of it, it's been a while since I've seen a couple costume that isn't Disney! I know a lot of little girls always go as princesses.
I agree! Especially since the new Beauty and the Beast movie came out, I think that will be a popular one this year.
You're right, my little cousin has been demanding to get a Belle dress for Halloween and it's only June!
Hey, maybe I'll get a Belle dress and you can be Cogsworth or Lumiere!
Oh goodness! I think maybe you should have your husband dress as Beast and you can be Belle.
If you aren't calling dibs on Cogsworth, I'll get my dog a costume!
