What is your favorite movie genre?
I love comedies but can also really get into horror flicks!
I love comedy too. Who is your favorite actor?
I love Tom Hanks because hes good in both comedy and drama!
I'm a big Tom Hanks fan also. Whats your favorite movie of his?
His best comedy, in my opinion is Money Pit.
I totally agree! I could watch it a million times!
I think I have!
Another one of my favorites is Apollo 13.
He is definitely versatile.
What about horror flicks? Whats your favorite?
I like a lot of them but nothing with too much blood and gore.
I know what you mean. I'm more into the supernatural.
Yeah, me too. Like the Exorcist?
Yeah. I love that one. I really liked Amityville Horror too.
I don't think I slept for a week after seeing that one!
Anything that has to do with spirits scare me...but I love them!
I didn't care for the Paranormal Activities series at all.
Me neither. Way too fake.
We'll have to catch a movie together sometimes!
