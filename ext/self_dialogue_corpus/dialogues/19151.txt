Who's your favorite artist of all time?
I'm not sure, I listen to all kinds of music. But I'd have to say Tycho
Who's tycho?
You probably haven't heard of him, but he's an indie rock, chill electronic guy.
O cool.
Yeah I like to listen to him when I go on runs.
What's his music like?
It's mellow guitar, electronic ambient sounds. It's really relaxing but has a certain pace to it.
I can see why you like running to it then.
What kind of music do you like?
I guess I'm the exact opposite. I listen to fast paced EDM.
What's your favorite artist?
Probably Adventure time, or for more mainstream music, Alesso or Eden.
Ah I know they're music. It's pretty intense.
Whenever I hit the gym. It's perfect for pumping steel.
Yeah I could see that. You probably go ham during the drops.
You bet. Sometimes I just sit down on the bench, and the time the drop to the last couple of reps.
that's a way to motivate you!
You bet. And then when the music goes crazy, it feels like I accomplished a huge feat.
Cool idea. I should make my music more intense when I'm on my final stretches of running.
