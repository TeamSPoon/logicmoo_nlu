I was trying to find some music for tomorrow night's party.
Sweet. Whatcha got so far?
Not much. Have any suggestions?
I kind of like that new Justin Bieber track.
Justin Bieber? Are you kidding?
Nope. It's pretty dope.
What's so different about it?
Well, for starters, he's singing in Spanish.
I didn't know he knew Spanish
I don't know if he does or not, but he sounds good.
What's it called?
Despacito.
What's that mean?
No idea. It's a remix of a Puerto Rican song, he just sings on it.
Sweet. What's it sound like?
Well, it's reggaeton, so it's got a beat to it.
So it's pretty danceable?
Definitely.
Cool. I'll add it to the playlist.
Sounds great. Can't wait!
