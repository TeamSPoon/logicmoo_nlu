So what us your favorite type of music.
You know I am really into country right now. I didn't use to be though.
Really? What made you change?
I just started to really listen to it and give it a chance and like what I heard.
Maybe I should do that. I have never been a big fan, but I also have never given it a chance.
Ya, I think you will like what you hear. There are so many other genres intermixed with it nowadays.
Who are some of your favorite country artists?
One of my favorites is Brad Paisley. He has catchy music with good lyrics.
I do like that country music tends to tell a story.
Ya that is one of my favorite things about it.
Who else do you like?
I really like Luke Bryan. You should listen to his song Country Girl.
Is it a fast or slow song. I tend to get sleepy listening to the slow songs.
It is a fast paced and fun song. It has a really good beat.
Is there any girl country artists that you like.
Ya. I like Carrie Underwood and Miranda Lambert. They actually joined together to do a song.
Really? What was that called.
It's called Something Bad. Its a really sassy song with a good beat.
Well, you got me interested enough to give country a try.
Ya I hope you do. I like you will be pleasantly surprised.
