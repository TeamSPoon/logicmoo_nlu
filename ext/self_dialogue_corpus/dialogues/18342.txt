Do you like any Motown music?
I've never heard of that. Is it a genre?
Kind of, it's actually a record label but they popularized the sound that is referred to as Motown. It was the first black owned record company in the U.S.
That's awesome. What does the music sound like?
It's great. It is kind of like soul music with some pop. It's hard to explain.
It sounds cool. Who are some Motown artists?
Marvin Gaye, Stevie Wonder, even Michael Jackson in his youth was signed to Motown Records.
Whoa! Now you've got my interest. I love Michael Jackson!
Me too! I never knew you liked MJ.
Of course I do! He's a legend. What songs did he release under Motown Records?

Wow, I can't believe I never knew this.
