What are some of the best movies about nothing?
Like, no real point?
Yes, just movies where nothing really happens but they are some how good.
I think the movie Office Space is like that.
The only one I know is Lost in Translation.
The one with Bill Murray?
Yes, that is the one.
I like his movies .
Well, I do to the ones where stuff happens.
Like Groundhogs days.
Did stuff happen in that one?
For like fourty years the same day did, over and over.
Right, but at the end of the movie it did not end up happening.
At least he got a shot as Andy Mcdowell.
But, it was the same thing over and over.
I liked him in Zombieland.
With Emma Stone?
Yes, he had a small part but it was so funny.
I liked when Jessie Esenbergh accidentally kills him.
Somehow that movies was so gory, but also reallt good too,
