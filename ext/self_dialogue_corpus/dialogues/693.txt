I am sure glad that NFL football is about to begin.
It certainly has been a long wait since the Super Bowl was played. The game was very interesting.
Atlanta really blew the game by not slowing down to take advantage of their lead.
We will see what next season brings. My favorite team the Steelers have a real shot.
That's great because I like the Steelers too.
Their offense is loaded especially if they can come to terms with LeVeon Bell.
That is a sticky situation, he can't lose with the garanteed francise tag salary.
Makes you wonder why he hasn.t signed it yet?
Must be some comfort of a long term deal.
The guaranteed money is really good. he should just take it and play his best.
The combination of Ben, Bell and Brown is devastating and then to add in Bryant.
This is really a scary offense for opposing defenses.
The Steeler defense isn't bad and it got a whole lot better in the offseason..
I like the addition of Alualu and TJ Watt.
The additions to the secondary should allow more man coverages.
Camereon Sutton and Davis should improve a good base group.
The secondary got better with Burns and Davis last year.
The linebackers improved immensely last year.
Sure hated lose of Lawrence Timmons.
He had lost his coverage skills, looking forward to an exciting season.
