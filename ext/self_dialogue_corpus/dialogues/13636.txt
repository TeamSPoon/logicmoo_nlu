I didn't think that Rogue One was a great movie.
I didn't either. The story didn't really go anywhere.
I thought that the young actors did a fine job though.
I agree. Felicity Jones is a great up and coming actress.
Bringing back Princess Leia and Han Solo didn't help the story.
Yes, their relationship was too sentimental.
Han's relationship with his son was really idealized.
Yeah, the director took that relationship too far.
It really felt like a Disney film rather than a Lucasfilm.
Lucas would have done it much better as a director.
