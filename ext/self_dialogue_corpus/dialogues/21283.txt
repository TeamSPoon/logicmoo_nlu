Any new movies you're interested in seeing?
Yeah, I really want to see Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2.
Cool, are you a big fan of the first one?
Yeah, I thought it was awesome. Great mix of humor and action.
Hopefully the sequel does it justice.
Yeah,I hope so. Anything coming out you want to see?
Yeah, I think King Arthur: Legend of the Sword looks pretty good.
Guy Ritchie directed that right?
Yeah, I'm a big fan of his movies.
I like the Sherlock Holmes ones he did.
Those were good and his older movies too like Snatch and Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels.
I haven't seen those.
You should watch them sometime if you get a chance.
I will. Speaking of older movies, I just re-watched Raiders of the Lost Ark the other day.
Does it hold up?
Oh yeah, very well. It's a true classic.
I watched it a million times when I was a kid but haven't seen it in awhile.
It wouldn't disappoint.
Have you either watched the Godfather Saga where they put the first two films together in chronological order?
Not yet, need a whole lot of time to watch all of that.
