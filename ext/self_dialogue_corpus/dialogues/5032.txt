How is Jose Bautista still in the league?
Hes good at hitting I guess
Yeah but I thought he was a steroid stallions
Nah theyve gotten those guys out
Yeah you are probably right
I cant believe though that some players still do them
They have to get a leg up on people
Just makes me upset youd think theyd be smarter
The name of the game is getting paid and homers get you paid
I think the analytics would refute that
How?
Teams are looking for all around hitters now
Yeah but if you can hit a dinger and be able to get a double teams will swarm to you
Most of the issues are still in Latin  America
Theyre all doing aderall I dont know about steroids
You can easily get a prescription for that
Can you?
A team doctor will do it to avoid the suspension
I just dont see how it affects baseball
Me either but it definitely does.
