Do you think Jack Nicholson is one of the best actors of all time?
Realistically no
So who would you give that to?
I dont know theres so many good ones
Robert DeNiro isnt a bad one
Al Pacino was on his way
I dont think so he did a few good ones and then just sucked
Godfather was such a great film
Its still relevant today
Do you think they would ever remake it?
No you cant touch a film like that.
Do you think he would ever reprise the role?
Not at all.
What about DeNiro?
I think they are all too old to do it again
What about a new generation of them>
It would always be compared to the original.
I think they could do wonders with it.
Not me, some films you cant touch thats one of them.
I disagree with you
