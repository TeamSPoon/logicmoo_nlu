I heard Wreck-it Ralph 2 is coming out in 2018.
Oh, cool. I loved the first one.
I did too. Remember Fix-It Felix?
Oh, yes. His voice was done by that guy from 30 Rock.
Right. The actor's name is Jack McBrayer.
There were so many funny characters in that movie.
I liked how all the bad guys had meetings to talk about how hard it was to be a bad guy.
I remember that. Didn't they have bad guys from actual video games in there?
I think so. I remember Bowser was there.
I wonder what the next movie will be about.
