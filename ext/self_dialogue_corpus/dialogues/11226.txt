What do you think about this summer's fashion?
I love the air flow and festival vibe.
I love the way skirts are long and airy.
I like the incorporation of bralettes.
Bralettes are nice and make throwing on a cute shirt easy.
I love throwing on a cool tank top over one.
Leggings are too hot to wear during summer.
Leggings can be sweaty and appear lazy.
They are on the way out except as pajamas.
I like shorts at night.
I have new linen shorts for this season.
I have a pair of pale blue ones.
Pale but colorful pieces are going to be a summer trend.
I have a pair of yoga mat sandlas to wear with my new shorts.
Comfortable sandals are a must.
They match my shorts also a must.
Platform sandals look good but make it hard to walk.
I agree. Good old flip flops for me. The most comfortable.
I can't wait to be walking around tanning my legs with my new anklet.
Foot jewelry will dress up flip flops, too.
