Hey you want to go see a movie?
Um I'm not sure what's playing tonight. When are you thinking of going?
After 6 tonight probably.
Sure I'm free then. What do you want to see?
There is Wonder Woman. I've heard great things about it.
Yeah me too. Who's playing her again?
Gal Gadot. And Pine is her hunk.
Really? I forgot he was in it.
Yep, Captain Kirk is playing with Wonder Woman.
Star Trek was good. Can't wait for the next one.
Me too!
What else is playing tonight though?
Looks like the new Pirates movie is still playing.
Ah Captain Jack Sparrow... I have heard of you!
He's probably the best pirate I've ever seen!
Agreed. Johnny Depp is amazing and beats Chris Pine any day.
Want to see the Pirate's  movie then?
Definitely!
I'll pick you up at 6:30 then as it starts at 7:15.
Sounds great! See you then.
