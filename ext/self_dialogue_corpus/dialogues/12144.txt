Which do you like more, the Star Wars original trilogy or the prequel trilogy?
Of course my choice is the original trilogy!
I also like the original trilogy more!
I can't believe they even released the prequel in the first place!
I know, it was so bad!
I think the only thing good about the prequel was Obi Wan Kenobi.
I agree with you!
I was also not a fan of Anakin Skywalker.
The only good thing about Anakin Skywalker was when he turned to the dark side.
My favorite scene was when Anakin got rid of the younglings.
