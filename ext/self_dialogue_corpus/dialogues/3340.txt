What's your favorite horror movie?
I'd have to say A Nightmare on Elm Street
Oh yeah, that movie's great! Do you mean the first one?
Yeah, the original Wes Craven film. Although, I did like all of the movies in the series.
I didn't really like the second one as much as the rest, how about you?
The second movie is definitely the worst in the series, but it's still fun to watch. I just like watching Freddy kill teenagers.
Did you know that in the first film, Glen was played by Johnny Depp, and it was his first movie role?
Oh, totally! He also makes a cameo in the Freddy's Dead film, which I thought was awesome.
Yeah, that movie was fun. Did you see the 2010 remake of A Nightmare on Elm Street?
No, I don't like the idea of anyone playing Freddy but Robert Englund.
