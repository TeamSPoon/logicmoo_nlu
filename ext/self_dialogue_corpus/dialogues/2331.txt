Hey there, I'm pretty excited for the football season to start, are you?
Absolutely!  I'm getting ready to start draft for my fantasy football league.
Oh really?  You have a football league?
Absolutely!  You want to join?
Most definitely, last year in my other league I very mistakenly put my faith in some of the bears players like alshon jeffrey, I'd love a chance at redemption
Oh yeah, the bears have been absolutely terrible as of late.
Yeah I'm hoping with the dump of Jay Cutler that the bears can actually improve.  Who knows, maybe they'll have a shot of making a comeback like the Cubs.
I don't know, I think it's going to take a while for the bears to rebuild their dynasty.
You know who I miss?  Urlacher, that guy was the heart and soul of that team.
Yeah the defense and the o-line has been horrible.
It's not small wonder Cutler was perpetually sacked, man couldn't get rid of the ball.
So who are going to be your top picks this year for the draft?
Oh definitely members of the patriots if I can, like brady, gronkowski, edelman.
Yeah the patriots are killing it...but do you think that the broncos can come back without manning behind the helm?
They have a lot of talent in their wide receivers...but you have to have a high quality QB at the helm.
And decent running backs, last year I had todd gurley as one of my first picks, dude hardly got me ANYTHING!
I think Matt Ryan could be strong at the helm for the falcons.
It depends on if he can continue his hot streak of if he slowly peters out like Manning did.
Yeah...I'm still bitter about his abysmal performance.
Well here's to kicking off "any given Sunday"!
