So, who you rooting for this year?
Let's see.  The Redskins.  The Jets.
Haha!  That will do no good to root for them.
I like the underdog.
Then, you're going for the right teams.
I can't stand the Patriots.  Cheaters.  I'm not rooting for them.
Even though you'll end up with a Super Bowl?
Yes.  I'm not a fair weathered fan.
Well, keep on rooting for the Jets.  You'll be a fan allright, just no wins.
I know.  Maybe I'll start following Pittsburgh.
With Roethlisberger?  No way.
I know, but they've created a dynasty and I think he's matured a lot.
Maybe.  They're a better choice than your others.
I'm hoping they'll actually utilize their draft picks.
Maybe.  What about Cleveland?
No way.  They can't pick a good player at all.
Haha!  You're right.  Better stick with Pittsburgh.
Yep.  I do like Bell.
He's paid way too much.  Choose someone else!
I'll have to think about that.  Everyone's paid too much.
