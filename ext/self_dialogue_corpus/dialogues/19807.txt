I've always liked this Iggy Pop song, it's probably my favorite of his.
That soundtrack got me into the Flaming Lips.
Bad Days is on the soundtrack album.
That album had a really good U2 song.
Same here. That tour was amazing.
He had the best sound.
He was the greatest that time.
I remember this song from Lego rockband.
Takes me back to Matt Hoffman's Pro BMX game for those of you that do remember.
Iggy Pop is a consistently underrated talent.
He is, however, consistent in producing fantastic music decade after decade.
I can never get tired of listening to any of them.
I remember a little over 20 years ago, I saw Iggy pop co-headline with Pearl Jam.
Bowie's back up vocals on this are flawless.
I know this song from a Guinness commercial.
I was lucky enough to see it performed live when he toured with Josh Homme last summer, it was great.
The first time I heard the song was when the Batman Forever soundtrack came out, and they had a Michael Hutchence cover of the song.
Has there ever been a bigger disparity between the quality of a movie and the quality of a soundtrack than Batman Forever?
Long and lean Batman swooping his cape behind him as he disappears over the edge of a rooftop, goofy humor, colorful, Robin, it's all there.
Unfortunately, it followed one of the weirdest movies of all time in Batman Returns so it was a bit jarring but Batman Forever, for what it is, is quite good.
