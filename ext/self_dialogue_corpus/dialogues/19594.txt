I have been listening to some retro music.
Really? What have you been listening to?
I think I just rediscovered REM.
Man, I haven't listened to them in ages. Which album or albums, are you listening to?
Murmur is one of my all time faves. Radio Free Paradise, I love Losing My Religion.
Oh yeah, me too. Those are good ones. Brings me back.
Yeah, so much good music. Remember Superman?
Yeah, I think everyone I knew was listening to that one. Seems like you heard everywhere.
Yeah, I know. I guess it's all nostalgic for me.
Good times no doubt. The music of that time period is so different from what I'm hearing now a days.
Yeah, it was distinctive for sure.
Yeah, before people started using all this equipment to help enhance their voices and crap.
Yeah, I miss the old school aspects. The sound is different. Those guys have had a great career.
No doubt, hard to believe they started out in Athens.
I know right? I remember the rumors of them being sighted at the Globe!
Yeah me too, it was like a fever on campus. Mostly bogus.
Yeah by then they were too big. Though I could see them just doing for history of the venue.
Yeah, things have gotten so cleaned up and lost all it's gritty charm.
I'm sure you can still find bands and bars like we did.
Yeah, but it won't be REM.
