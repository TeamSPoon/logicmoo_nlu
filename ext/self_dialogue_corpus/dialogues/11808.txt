Whenever I go home for the holidays, my Dad plays The Beatles nonstop.
Does that bug you?
No, I like The Beatles. It just makes me not feel like listening to them anywhere else.
I understand that. It's probably a lot at once.
Yeah. And my memories of most of the songs are connected to my childhood home.
So it feels wrong listening to it somewhere else?
Basically. I really do like The Beatles though.
I do too. Do you have a favorite song?
I like Norwegian Wood.
What a coincidence, me too!
