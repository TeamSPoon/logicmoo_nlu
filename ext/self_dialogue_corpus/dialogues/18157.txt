Do you own any Caribbean music?
Yes, if you consider Bob Marley to be in that genre.
He definitely is. I like "No Woman No Cry".
I think "One Love" is one of his best.
My little brother was exercising to "Jamming" with his PE class last week.
Wow, the middle school is lucky to have such good music.
We were allowed to bring music to school last week. I brought Jimmy Buffett.
Which song did you find acceptable lyrics from?
My mom let me bring "Cheeseburger in Paradise". She said those lyrics should be fine for school.
Very true. I did not think you would risk "Margaritaville".
I think Rihanna has an island sound to her voice in some of her songs.
I agree, she was from Barbados before debuting her first album "Music of the Sun".
The first song I remember liking from her was "Umbrella".
I loved that song and then she kept making great hits with "Disturbia" and "Diamonds".
Many Caribbean singers have done well for themselves.
I know, I had never heard of Sean Paul until he sang with Sia on "Cheap Thrills".
That song was at the top of the charts for a long time last summer.
It was the song that I would play when running.
Do you like the band Train?
Yes, their last song "Play That Song" had the best beat.
