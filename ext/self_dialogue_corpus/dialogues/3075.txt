I've read that the Cowboys could be in for a slump this year.
I wouldn't be surprised.
I wouldn't either really.
Every thing seemed to fall into place last year.
On offense they did.
Right,I think their defense could be worse.
I don't see much improvement.
Is dak Prescott going to be as good?
NFL defense have a way of figuring out quarterbacks their second year in.
Yes,things can even out.
They do have a good offensive line though.
Yes they do.
And a good running back.
Yes,Elliot is good.
To me,dez Bryant is not a big game player.
He does come up short when the games get tough
Also ,can he stay healthy is a good question.
The same health question for Jason witten too.
He's coming back,from an injury.
Yes,and he's getting older and is been beat up over the years
