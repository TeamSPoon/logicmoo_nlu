Do you like the Beatles?
I love their music.
Me too. I grew up listening to their albums.
So did I.
What's your favorite Beatles' song?
It would have to be Hey Jude.
I just heard a live version that Paul McCartney did at one of his concerts awhile back.
Oh I bet that was great.
It really was. He let the audience sing along and it sounded like so much fun.
I need to try to find that and listen to it.
