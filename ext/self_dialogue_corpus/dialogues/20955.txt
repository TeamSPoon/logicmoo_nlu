Let me ask you, have you seen any great documentaries lately?
Yes, I know just the one for you to see. It's about Anthony Weiner.
Oh, really? That dude's a trip.
I know, right? This documentary is fascinating, because it's a true inside look at a campaign falling apart at the seams.
How did they get that kind of access?
So what happened was Weiner brought in this documentary to film what he thought was going to be his big comeback.
Well, it almost was!
Yeah, he was way out in front of the polls in the mayor's race.
So they were there for the downfall.
Exactly. When the sexting scandal broke again, this documentary film crew was already there.
Oh man. His wife really stuck it out, huh?
Yeah, honestly, she was the star of the film. She's always giving Anthony these looks like, how did I get stuck with you?
It's funny how this stuff can be so fascinating when you know how it ends.
Exactly! I followed the story as it unfolded pretty closely. It was an epic implosion.
What makes it such a great documentary though?
Well, they had nearly unprecedented access to a campaign in upheaval and despair. You actually see the wheels coming off in real time.
That's crazy.
So you want to watch it this weekend?
Yeah I go, let's do it! Then we can watch All the President's Men too!
Poly Sci movie marathon!
