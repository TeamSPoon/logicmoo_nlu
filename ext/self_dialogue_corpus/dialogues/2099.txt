hey are you excited for the new season?
I sure am it is going to be good,who are you rooting for this year?
I am hoping the Cowboys go far really
oh why is that?
well because they got a young team mostly and did well last season.
That is true Dak is a great Quarterback for them.
He sure is,who are you going to root for?
I really like Green Bay
Oh really why is that?
Well usually just followed them all my life especially recently and just been a life fan
That is pretty cool, but isn't Aaron Rodgers getting pretty rusty?
I donno about that last year he did really well
that is true he really came back in the playoffs.
He really did ,like they were losing to the falcons and he brought them back.
He is really one of the best players in the NFL.
He really is and I would say the best QB that there ever was.
I really do not know about that man
Why is that? who do you think is better
I donno just that there have been many great QB's in the NFL
And Aaron Rodgers is the best there ever was.
