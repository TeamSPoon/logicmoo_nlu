Who sang that song about Anne Frank?
Are you thinking of Neutral Milk Hotel?
Yes, them. That song is great.
That whole album is wonderful
Yeah it took me a bit to get used to his voice
What is the lead singers name?
Jeff Mangum. Did you know he's from LA?
I didn't know that! What was the name of that album?
In an Aeroplane Over the Sea
Ah, that must be the name of the Ann Frank song too.
I think so. I also like King of the carrot flowers.
I heard someone describe them as psychedelic folk
I've never heard that term.
Robyn Hitchcock and T. Rex can also be described that way.
I can understand that.
Yeah I don't really like their sound
Especially T.Rex right?
Do you like the mountain goats
some of their songs are okay
yeah i'm not into them
