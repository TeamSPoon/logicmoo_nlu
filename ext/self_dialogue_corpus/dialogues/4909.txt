Aaron Judge sure turned things around this year, didn't he?
Yeah he's the biggest thing in baseball this year.
He performed so poorly last season, I thought for sure he'd be sent back down to the minors.
I didn't think so. He was just young and nervous, coming in almost at the end of the season.
True. Remember when he finally almost got a run in, and he tripped at the last second?
Yeah that was awful for him. He hurt his ankle too if I remember correctly.
My heart broke for him.But you're right, he came back with a vengeance this year!
Well he probably had A-Rod mentoring him. He's bound to improve
He's a really big guy too.
Yeah 6'7". A guy like that is bound to be a powerful hitter. He could be team captain.
Well, the Yankees don't have team captains anymore.
They dpm
