Do you think this needs more bass?
Sir, i dont know you and you are standing way too close to me. Please turn your music down.
Brother, this volume is only going higher. Lend me your ears!
Please move away from me.
Feel the rhythm in your bones!
I'm leaving.
Wait, please dont go. I just want your opinion on my track!
Well for starters, its too loud. And has too many expletives.
Im just expressing myself.
You can express yourself somewhere else for all I care.
You dont like my music?
I do not.
What kind of music turns you on ma' man?
I listen to jazz. Free form.
Right on, I can dig it.
I can't stand this rap nonsense you are trying to peddle to me.
You sir, are ignorant. I am just telling it like it is.
Well try telling someone else, preferably not at a bus stop.
Thanks for your ears, brother. Want to buy some weed?
I'm calling the cops.
