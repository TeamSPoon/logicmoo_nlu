Do you like musicals?
Do you mean musicals turned into movies?
Yeah thats what I meant
Yeah I liked Grease.
That was my favorite musical movie you could say
I loved the way Olivia Newton John sang
John Travolta was great too
Yeah overall the sound was awesome
The acting was not that bad either.
Did you see the sequel?
No because none of the original cast was present.
I think one or two were in it
Travolta did a great job and it brought you back to the 50s.
That was the point of the movie.
Did it really jump start anyones career?
Not really
Some never had careers besdies that movie.
Did Travolta really sing in it?
He would have made an album if he had.
They did a great job hiding it then
