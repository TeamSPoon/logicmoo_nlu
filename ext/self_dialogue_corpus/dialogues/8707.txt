Dang, rock seems to be dead today!
You are wrong about that.
Why do you say that?
I am going to see At The Drive-In today.
That band is still around?
Indeed. You should get some tickets.
I don't know if I have money. Do they have any new music?
Yes they do. They just made a new album.
I think it might be worth checking them out. I loved them back in the day.
So did I. The new album is just as good as the old stuff.
