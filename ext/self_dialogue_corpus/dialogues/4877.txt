Do you think analytics is ruining the game?
No I think it improves it immensely.
Now they are devaluing closers.
And thats the way it should have went
How so?
They put too much emphasis on getting 3 outs in the 9th.
I guess so
Think about it, isnt it important to get the meat of the lineup out?
Always
OK so if they appear in the 8th dont you want your best reliever pitching to them
I am seeing your point.
And then go ahead and  throw whomever in the lineup
So what stat would you use to determine the value of a reliver
Inherited runners scored.
Thats a good stat
But then again so is holds.
I think thats the same thing as a save essentialy.
Yeah its not conclusive but it is what it is
I think we need to stop focusing on stats.
Baseball is all about the numbers
