Have you seen any funny movies recently?
A few new ones, a few older ones.
Such as what?
I just watched Baywatch.
Who is in that one?
The Rock, and Zax Effron and some others.
Was it as funny as the series?
It was far more funny. Less slow running and more jokes.
Have you seen any other new ones?
I want to see the third Despicable Me movie.
Is that the one with the little yellow things in overalls?
The minions, yes and Steve Carrel as Gru.
I think I saw the first one, it was cute.
This is the third and there is a minion sort of prequel as well.
I like cartoons.
Have you seen the adult one called Sausage party?
No, who is it by?
Seth Rogen made it. Very raunchy.
Was it funny.
More weird than funny, but made me laugh out loud a bit.
