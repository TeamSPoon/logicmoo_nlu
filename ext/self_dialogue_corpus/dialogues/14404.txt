Did you see the game 3 between the Warriors and the Spurs?
Yes. The Spurs didn't stand a chance without Kawhi Leonard.
I know but they still have Lamarcus Aldridge.
Yes, but he is not as good as Kawhi.
Aldridge did score 18 points in the game.
The problem with that is that he only had 5 rebounds so that is not going to cut it.
Danny Green and Patty Mills didn't shoot the ball well either.
Yes, both of those players shot well below 50%.
The Spurs also shot terrible from the 3 point line.
That's true. A team that plays against the Warriors and shoots that poorly is probably not going to win the game.
On the flip side, the Warriors got 33 points from their star player Durant.
Yep, Curry also pitched in a respectable 21 points.
Did you know Durant also had 10 rebounds?
I didn't but I did notice that the Warriors turned the ball over 21 times.
Yes, it was a strange game for them.
Yep, but it appears that it didn't matter because they hit over 50% of their shots.
Exactly, they still beat the Spurs by a respectable 12 points.
Yep, if the Spurs do not win the next game, their season is finished.
That is so true but what can they do with Kawhi Leonard.
I don't know but they better figure something out very quickly.
