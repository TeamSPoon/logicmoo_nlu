Is that Ed Sheeran's new music you are listening to?
Yeah. Shape of You by Ed Sheeran.
I like his music.
I love the way it starts.. that music.. it is awesome.
Yeah but the last fight sucks.﻿
What do you mean?
In the video for this song, the last fight.
Oh. I haven't seen the video yet.
You should see it.. its funny﻿.
Would it be a good idea to sing this song to a girl that you like?﻿
I don't know but I do know ...you will never know if you don't try﻿.
Yeah but I'm going to middle school and i need advice﻿.
Well, if you can actually sing, sure. It's rather cheesy though, just do it when you're in the relationship.
I have the whole summer to practice singing this song.
Go for it. It's a hit or miss usually and you may win her heart with this song.﻿
So i will try to get better at singing and remember the lyrics by the summer's end.
But  just don't sing the "last night you were in my room and my bed sheets smell like you.." bit.﻿
Too much?
She might take offense to it. Especially if you two aren't really dating.
I gotcha.
