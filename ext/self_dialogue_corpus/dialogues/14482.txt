Who do you think will be in the NBA Finals?
Definitely Golden State.
What about from the East?
Cleveland. The only question is who will win that series?
I think it will be close.
I heard Golden State will be heavy favorites.
The West is much tougher than the East.
Agreed, but the Cavs are pretty good.
Sure, but they only have 1 decent player.
True. Without him, they would not even make the playoffs.
Do you think the Kevin Durant trade was good?
Well, it has certainly worked out so far.
I think the Warriors would win the championship even without him.
That may be true, but you can never have too many all-stars.
What time is the next game?
I think the Celtics and Cavs play tonight.
Where is the game?
Cleveland. The Cavs won both games in Boston.
Wow. Their season may as well be over.
Agreed. It would take a miracle for Boston to win the series now.
