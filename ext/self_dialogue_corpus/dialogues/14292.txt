I can see the NBA decreasing playoff teams soon
No way TV Will not allow that
But what is the point of all the games then?
Iron out seeding in my opinion.
So cut the season down and playoffs in half.
And lose almost an entire season of ad revenue?
They can make it up.
Not true, player salaries keep increasing as well.
I think you are overthinking all of this.
No I think they are trending in the right direction to try and make it harder to get in the playoffs.
I sort of believe that.
But I think the playoffs this year are an abberation.
In what sense?
They havent been competitive at all.
I think thats just the way the NBA is this year.
Not one series has really been too interesting outside of Boston and Washington
I think they could have been better I do agree with that.
They need to look into fixing this before it becomes a yearly things
Like I said its just a one time thing
Or a sign of worse things to come
