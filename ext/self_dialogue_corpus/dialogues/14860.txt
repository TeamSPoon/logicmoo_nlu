What is your favorite comedy?
You know I love those old movies from the 1980's. All I have to say is Caddy Shack.
Yeah, that's one of my favorites too. What about Ferris Bueller's Day Off? Gremlins, Airplane.
Yep, those were good ones. What about Ghost Busters and Airplane.
The humor was different then. I think in some ways we were allowed to laugh at eveyone.
Yeah, things are so PC now. Though I have to say did you see Key and Peele in Keanu?
Those guys are so funny. I would watch them in anything!
So I guess you saw them in Storks and Wanderlust?
Yeah, the wolf scenes are so funny. I don't remember the other.
Well it was worth watching them for the wolves. Hope they do something new soon. Those guys are so irreverently funny.
