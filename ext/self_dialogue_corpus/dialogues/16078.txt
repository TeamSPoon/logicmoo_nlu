What type of music do you listen to?
I really like a lot of indie and alternative rock?
Me too! What are your favorite bands?
I have too many to list, but lately I've been listening to a lot of Vampire Weekend.
I saw them last year in Chicago. Have you ever seen them live?
Not yet, but I would love to some time soon.
What is your favorite album by them?
I really like their self-titled album the most.
That was a great album. It's hard to believe that next year it will be 10 years old.
Really? I didn't even realize its been out since 2008.
What is your favorite song off of the album?
I would have to say Oxford Comma, but Bryn is a close second.
Great choices! I would pick Walcott.
They are such a great band to just relax and listen to, aren't they?
I totally agree. I wonder when their next album is going to come out.
Me too. It feels like Modern Vampires of the City came out so long ago.
I believe that album came out in 2013, so you're totally right on that.
What was your favorite song on that album?
Ya Hey. I find that song to be so fun, and the choruses are so different.
That's my favorite too! I think I need to listen to some Vampire Weekend now.
