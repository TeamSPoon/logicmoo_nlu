who do you think is the greatest rapper of all time?
That is a hard question to answer but I think that Eminem is one of the best if not the very best.
why is that? because most people would have said Tupac or Biggie.
I think that Biggie was better than Tupac but i think that had both lived later in life they would have played out
What do you mean?
I think that both of them would have played out to the full extent of their talent, I dont think that they had what it takes to have a long lasting career at the top.
And you think that Eminem does?
I think that he has already been at the top for a long time and I think that he will continue to show up at the top.
Why is that?
I think that he has the ability to create different emotions in his music from comedy to anger and sadness and is very open in his music and truthful and those are things that will connect with almost anyone is some aspect so I think he will continue to have a long career at the top.
