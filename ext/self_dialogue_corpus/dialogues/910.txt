Who is the next big QB in the league?
Maybe Carson Wentz?
What makes you think its him?
He has in the intangibles and looks like a leader.
How about Dak Prescott?
He could be the next one as well though its tough because he has the best line and RB in the league.
Guys like Brady, Roethlisberger, and Brees will be gone soon
Yeah its a definite changing of the guard in the NFL
So now we have to look at who will take over for the league
I think you could include Andrew Luck in that list.
Yeah hes been hurt or mired on a bad team lately
But he still has the requisite skills to be good
Yeah I agree with that point
So we named 3 is there anyone else
Mariota in Tennessee could be like that.
Yeah its tough with him
Whys that?
He has a skillset that I dont know can succeed over time
Almost every QB does though
I dont know Wentz is a traditional QB in my eyes
