Have you seen the new Cars movie yet?
No, but I'd like to. What number is it?
It's the third in the series.
Do you think they'll make more?
it's entirely possible. Kids, especially little boys, adore it.
True. My son likes it, but he prefers Monsters Inc.
That's a great movie! Have you seen Monsters University as well?
Yes, probably a thousand times. He also likes to watch the Toy Story trilogy.
Toy Story is my favorite too!
Those little aliens in the claw machine are the cutest.
