Hey could you recommend me some new music?
Sure. What do you like?
How about some indie rock?
OK, have you heard of Car Seat Headrest?
No, what are they like?
It's actually one person. One very talented young guy who plays several instruments and sings.
Cool. So what's the music like?
It channels Pavement and Guided By Voices and other classic indie bands.
So it's pretty derivative?
No, he puts his own personal stamp on the music. And the lyrics are good too.
Cool. What albums do you recommend?
So far he's only got one official album out. It's called Teens of Denial.
Great. Where can I find it?
I think it's on spotify.
Awesome. Any other bands to recommend?
Have you heard of U2?
No, that sounds really obscure.
Yeah, they are an up and coming band. Nah, I love U2.
I hate them. The Joshua Tree sucks.
You have terrible taste.
