There have been a lot of deaths of famous musicians lately.
I know! Just the other day it was Gregg Allman of the Allman Brothers.
That was a great band right?
Sure was. I listened to them all the time.
I remember seeing them in concert at the Trenton State Fairgrounds in 1978 in NJ. That was a great concert.
Did anyone else play?
Yes, Santana. They were just becoming sort of well known at that point.
Sounds like a great concert.
Oh it was! Gregg Allman was so drunk on stage he could barely stand up but put on a great show none the less.
Sounds amazing! I wish I could have been there.
It was outside in the summer, hot day too. No seats so we were right up by the stage.
Really? By the stage?
Yes, security at concerts back then was nothing like today. Basically there was none.
The Allman Brothers had some great songs like Melissa, Whipping Post and Blue Sky.
They were some of my favorites too.
Eat a Peach was my favorite album.
That one was really good but the best was Live at Filmore East.
Oh yea! My sister saw them play there.
Boy if only we could go back in time.
I agree , there were some awesome bands in the seventies.
