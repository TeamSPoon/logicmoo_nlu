Are you in to Disney at all?
Yeah, growing up I had so many Disney movies!
Same.
Isn't it crazy how they're re-making them all now?
Yeah, they're now targeting all audiences with all the special effects and what not.
Beauty and the Beast, The Jungle Book...
I almost see more adults going into the theaters than kids!
I think a lot of it has to do with the fact that these movies are near and dear to our hearts.
Yeah, like from watching them growing up?
Exactly, just like movies like Frozen will be near and dear to our kids' hearts.
