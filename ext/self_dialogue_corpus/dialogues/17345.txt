Do you like RIck Ross?
Yes but he's not one of my favorites.
He's one of my top rappers.
I just can't get past his attitude.
Why is that?
He has this old school hard thug attitude I just don't like it.
He does come off that way, maybe it's just how he grew up.
Maybe.
What's your favorite song of his?
Everyday I'm Hustling.
That's a classic and might be his best song.
Most popular at least.
Do you like any others?
Mayback baby.
I loved that one.
Yeah it's one of my favorite songs period.
Do you think his music is good for parties?
Yes, just mix it in with other songs.
From other rappers?
Yes, that's what I meant.
