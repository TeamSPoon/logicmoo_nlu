Do you think AJ Cole can hold down the 5th rotation slot for the Nats?
He's pitching well, I don't see why not.
Ross is on his way back, that's why I'm asking.
Is he? Last I saw he was struggling in the minors. Hard to call that "on his way back."
You never know with Dusty Baker.
That's the truth. The way Dusty treats pitchers I wouldn't be surprised if the last healthy arm won.
Haha. Yeah. I like Cole though, I just hope he stays healthy.
Definitely a lot of promise for Cole and all things considered I don't see a reason why he can't take this opportunity and run with it.
Roark was in a similar position and it worked out.
Yep. And some think Cole is even more highly regarded than Roark was at that time.
Even if Ross does come back healthier that's not a bad problem to have though.
Got that right. Nats have a solid staff as is.
Yeah, bullpen is a little iffy but the starters are all pretty solid quality.
Scherzer is a monster. Strasburg when he's going strong is unhittable. Thats a 1-2 punch right there.
Gio Gonzalez is not bad either. At least right now he's looking like his old self.
Yeah I always forget Gio, was still thinking Zimmerman even though I know he's gone.
Gotta keep up with Mets pitching in our division.
Yeah they're another solid staff but there's some muck in the works with Harvey and still not sure about the back end.
Right but they have the depth that can figure it out over the course of the year, I see them as comparable with us maybe even a little better.
Right. When you guys play a series there's some good matchups on the hill.
