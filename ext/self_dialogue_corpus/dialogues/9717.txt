Do you listent to rap music?
Yeah, all the time. It gets me pumped.
Yeah, I like it a lot too. Who do you like?
I mostly like earlier artists, like Dr. Dre, Snoop dogg, tupac, notorious big, nas, a tribe called quest. I like Eminem too, but he's a little more recent.
Oh yeah, I like all of those artists. I noticed there seem to be a lot of talented and unique acts out there now.
Yeah, there seems to have been a bit of an increase in unique rappers lately that can spit game.
It almost seems like a wave of indie rappers who are also commercially successful. Like Migos, Flatbush Zombies, Lil Uzi Vert, Logic, and Future.
Yeah, I can see that. I haven't heard of all the ones you listed, but I do recognize and like some of the rappers you said.
I could be wrong, but it seems like Youtube has played a huge role in the popularity of up and coming rappers.
Yeah, there are a lot of artists that get a lot of free exposure from Youtube. There's a number of rappers I would never have heard of if it wasn't for the videos on youtube.
