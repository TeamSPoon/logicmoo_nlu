what do you think of players entering the NFL
what do you mean?
like, do you think they are as good as the people already drafted?
probably not, to be honest, but that's not really their fault.
yeah, people who are drafted are relatively young, aren't they?
yeah, i think a lot are between 18 and 25.
some are even drafted out of high school.
yeah, but not a lot, only the best.
yep, why do you think they draft so young?
probably to keep people around the longest.
yeah, and the fact that younger people are more agile and quick.
not all the time, though, some older players are still better than the young ones.
like who?
you know, the legends - brady, farve, etc.
i feel like some people in the NFL have a natural knack at it, though.
that's because they do, everyone has a natural talent somewhere.
and for some it's football!
yeah, except they still have to retire eventually.
well i'm interested to see who gets drafted next.
me too.
