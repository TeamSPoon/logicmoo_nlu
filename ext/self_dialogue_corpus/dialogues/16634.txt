Do you ever listen to Taylor Swift?
No, never.  Do you?
Yes, my daughter loves her!
Do you like listenening to her though?
Her music is actually kind of fun.
Really?  I mean, I really don't like pop.
It's pop, but the songs are usually upbeat and positive.
I've heard a few on the radio.
Aren't they catchy though?
Yeah, I admit I sing along to "Trouble" if I hear it.
See?  She has some fun music!
I guess.  Are her CD's any good?
We really liked the last one.
I might have to borrow it sometime.
Yeah, you should.  She's really a great artist.
I know she's good, I've just never really been into the pop thing.
Some of her music is more thought out.
Doesn't she write her own songs?
Some of them.  And she writes for other artists as well.
I guess she is talented.
