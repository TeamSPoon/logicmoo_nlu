I don't understand the hate for Iron Man 3.
You must have never read the comic books.
I've read them. I know all about The Mandarin guy.
Then you know how they screwed up the story.
I don't agree with that. I think they made it more interesting.
I don't see how.
Anyway, you're missing the broader point the director made.
And what's that?
The whole story is an example of the war on terror today.
What gives you that idea?
The fake Mandarin was an actor; someone used to push an agenda.
You're talking about conspiracies?
Yeah it makes perfect sense and it fits right in to what I've heard over the years.
Yeah, well. They should have used another villain to make their point about world politics.
Maybe. Is there going to be another Iron Man movie?
I don't think so. He's in the next Spider-Man movie and Avengers.
I know. I was hoping the writers would introduce a proper Mandarin villain for the fans.
I think they should quit while they're ahead.
Can't please everyone, I guess.
They could if they actually read the comics.
