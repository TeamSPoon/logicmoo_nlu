Who do you think is the Best QB in the NFL?
Hmmm.  I'm going with Brady because of that comeback.
Good choice, although I think he's a little over the hill and Rodgers or Ryan might be better now.
Yeah they're all lights out.  I can see either one of them.
Yeah, Ryan hasn't done it year in and year out though.
I hear you.  Last year he was boss, but Rodgers every year is awesome.
You know who's not elite but overlooked?  Stafford.
Oh man heck yeah.  He always has good numbers but his team can't seem to win.
Not consistently at least.  Plus us seems to make bad decisions in the playoffs.
That seems to be the same for lots of guys.  Like Andy Dalton.
I agree, Dalton is really good.
He had an off year though.
You know who's over rated?  Flaco.
Yes!  He's what I would call above average.
Same with Wilson.
Yeah, good enough to stay, but can't carry a team.
Not like Rodgers, or Brady.
Yeah, Eli too.
I knew you would say that you Giants fan.
Have to remind you every once in a while.
