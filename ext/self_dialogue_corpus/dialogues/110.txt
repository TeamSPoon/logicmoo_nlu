What superhero movies feel short for you , (if any)?
The avengers. I thought it was a disaster.
Really , why? Was it the acting?
Not so much the acting, just the movie as a whole. The script mostly just did not do it for me.
I thought the cast was great and  so many even carry there own films, downey, chris evans I am surprised you did not enjoy seeing them reprise these roles.
I think they each are very talented. Maybe I just have trouble buying into the grouping together. Like too many to get quality focus on each.
I think many people love it for the group aspect, getting to see so many favorites altogether.
I personally would rather watch iron man, captain america etc individual films.
Interesting I wonder how many others feel this way.. if any, because avengers was so popular has a sequel and did very well at he box office.
I am a weirdo maybe, but just my least favorite superhero film/films. I don't think I could even make it awake in another viewing.
