Do you like Disney movies or Nickeldoen ones better?
For sure Disney. They make better feature length films.
What do you think about the whole princess genre ?
Like Snow White and so on?
Yes the princess cartoons.
I loved the old ones. The way they hand drew the animation in Snow White as well as Cinderella .
I like the music in them.
Disney has a real good way of making these catchy songs.
I still find myself singing the themes from Hercules the Disney movie.
Oh, that one was so underrated.
