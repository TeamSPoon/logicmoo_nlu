One of the funniest movies was on TNT last night.
Yeah, what's that?
Groundhogs Day.
That was funny. I must have seen it about 20 times.
Me too, at least.
Bill Murray had so many great lines.
He did.
Chris Elliot was in it too, right?
Yeah, the camera man.
That's right.
Could you imagine being stuck reliving the same day over.
Well it would depend which day.
That's true.
Punxsutawney Phil, and that actually happens there.
I know. Let's believe a groundhog.
It was funny when he kidnapped Phil.
Yeah, and then drove off a cliff.
Wouldn't that have been awful if that was his last day reliving it.
Yeah, I wouldn't have taken that chance.
Me either.
