Have you watched any good movies lately?
Yea, we watch at least one or two every week. Some down time.
What did you see last?
We watched an action movie called Criminal.
Who is in that one?
Kevin Costner is the main character.
Is he a good guy or bad guy?
Well he is the criminal and they inject memories of a good guy in his brain.
So does he turn good?
Not really, but a lot of the memories really affect him and he tries to do some good for the other mans family.
Is it worth watching?
Yea, he plays a good part, as usual.
Any other good actors in it?
Ryan Reynolds is the man that dies and his memories are put in Costners brain.
So he gets killed right in the beginning?
Yea, but you occassionally see him throughout the movie because of his memories living on.
Is there a lot of action.
Oh yea and Costner saves the day.
He usually does in his movies.
Yea he has had a lot of good roles.
