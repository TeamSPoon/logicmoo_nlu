Have you heard of Celtic Woman?
Yeah I've seen their shows on Public television.
What did you think?
I liked them. Some of the vocalists are REALLY good.
I think they feature female musicians too.
I've seen the violinist. Maybe a pianist as well.
What was your favorite show?
At Christmas they put a really nice show together, really festive.
I caught one of those. They went all out.
True. The shows are really well attended too.
It looks like they're popular.
Some of the singers started pretty young.
Yeah, maybe 15 or 16 it seems?
I think so. And then they switch up the performers.
Which songs of theirs do you like?
Home for Christmas, O Danny Boy.
I haven't heard those. They sound like good renditions.
They brought tears to my eyes.
They can sing really beautifully.
Their album sales demonstrate that!
