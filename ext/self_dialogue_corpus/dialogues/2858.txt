Hey mom, were we still having to go to Philadelphia this winter?
We have to in order to see your uncle.
I know, I just wanted to see if we could make a slight detour.
It really depends, what did you want to do?
I wanted to visit the Lincoln Financial Field.
Is that for Baseball for something?
No it is for the Eagles Football team.
Oh that sounds very cool, I honestly don't see why not.
Thank you mom, my favorite player of all time was on that team.
Which player was that?
I loved the quarterback Donvan McNabb.
Oh I remember you having his jersey.
Yeah I wore it all the time!
Does he still play?
Not anymore, he was big over 10 years ago when I was finishing high school.
I may want to check out a game there since we won' visit again for a long time.
I would love to watch a game, it would honor the best QB of all time.
I will check for tickets.
Thanks mom I love you.
I love you too!
