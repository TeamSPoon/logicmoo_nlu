How do you think the AZ Cardinals will do this season
If we can stay healthy and keep Carson upright, we should do OK as the division is pretty weak.
Yeah, the Rams are a dumpster fire and the 49'ers are pretty bad
Yup - it'll come down to Seattle as it does every year.
Crazy news about Marshawn signing / playing with the Raiders huh?
Totally, I liked the Raiders and Carr before, but now think they should take that division down
I expect the Raiders to edge out the Chiefs and Broncos - Chargers are lost
The stuff I read about Chargers and the move to LA was pretty confusing and dysfunctional
I don't know why that owner didn't do more to keep them in SD rather than play 2nd fiddle to the Rams
It's like dumb and dumber
For sure, I don't pretend to know what it's like to have that much money, but seems that they could have stayed and paid about the same as the relocation fee?
These owners are cheap billionaires that want the public to foot the bill for their stadiums.
It is pretty ridiculous and I think the way this all used to work will no longer be viable
Qualcom was a dump, but I wouldn't want to pay more taxes to build them a new stadium.
So the Chargers won 5 games last year - do you think they win less playing in SD for their final year?
Rivers will be Rivers for a few more years, and they do have a strong run game, but what are they playing for?
Yes, unlike the Raiders moving to Las Vegas, there are not a ton of Charger fans outside of SD
Right, Raider fans seem like their are everywhere - like a plague
I'm excited for the season to start and see how it unfolds
Me too, like every year, regardless of the drama - it will be a great season for most of us fans!
