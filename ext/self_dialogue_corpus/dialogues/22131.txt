Sorry we got cut off at last week's lunch movie discussion.
Well, I did think it was rude that you answered your cell phone before I could finish my thought.
Well, we were talking about blockbusters which makes me think of action films and computer generated effects.
Yes, so many films are like that these days.
But another type of film so prevalent these days, animated--you said you don't seek those out either.
Yes, I've been burned a couple times planning to go to a movie featuring one of my favorite actors, only to find that they are just doing voiceover for an animated character.
But haven't you liked some of those movies--come on give me a few.
O.K., but most are probably a few years old, but don't worry I won't bring up Steamboat Willy.
What, oh yeah, early Disney; all right, go on.
Toy Story, Tangled, Up,Up and Away, those ogre ones.
Shrek?
Yes--that's all I can think of--oh I did see some other Disney ones--Little Mermaid and that ice one.
Frozen.  Well what about the new version of Beauty and The Beast?
I actually did see that.
And?
Pretty good, because I liked that it had real people along with the animation.
Big Emma Watson fan are you?
Actually I've only seen one or two Harry Potter films, but she's all right.
O.K., you've missed so many animated films, but next time let's talk about a good recent movie.
All right, if I don't get out of the house, I'll see what Netflix has to offer.
