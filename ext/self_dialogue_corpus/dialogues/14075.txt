What is your favorite Lady Gaga song?
I would say Bad Romance.
That is a fun song, but I like something more for the club.
Oh I see. Like Poker Face?
Exactly. It's got a great dance beat.
What do you think of Born this Way then?
I like the message, but it's not very dance-y.
I would agree.
I also think it's a little too much like Madonna's music.
Like Lady Gaga should get her own style and not steal hers? I get it.
