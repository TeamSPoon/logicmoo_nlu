Yes he is.

That part is very funny.
What is your favorite?
I like when he is yelling at his ball to go in the hole.
That is also a very funny part.
It has been a long time since I watched that movie.
I own it, you could borrow the DVD sometime.
That would be great.
I own a lot of movies with Adam Sandler.
You can't go wrong there.
He is one of my favorite actors.
He is in my top five for sure.
Wow, I never knew we had that in common.
Me either.
