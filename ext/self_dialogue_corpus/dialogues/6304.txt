Did you see the new Cinderella movie?
I haven't but I really want to!
I don't think it was as good as the animated one, but the acting was decent.
What about the new Beauty and The Beast, have you seen that?
Yeah, Emma Watson was phenomenal!
I thought so too!
She actually reminds me of the animated Belle, which I think was even better.
Yeah, I thought that was a really good choice.
Do you remember who played the beast?
No, not really but the CGI to make him look like a beast was unreal!
