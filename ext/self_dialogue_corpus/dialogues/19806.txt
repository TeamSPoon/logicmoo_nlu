What are you listening to, Andy?
Cocaine by Eric Clapton.
That song sounds good. That bass is kicking.
I know.
Why is this my first time hearing this song?
I don't know.
That sounds like a live version? Is it?
Yeah. Sounds good too, don't it?
Man. Not many songs sang live sound good.
I know. Some artists can't sing live.
They need computers to make their voices sound good.
If you wanna hang out, you gotta take her out.
That is so true.
But what was he really talking about? Cocaine or a woman?
I think it is obvious what he singing about.
The title says it all, huh?
Yep, Talking about that white powder.
Yeah. That's what most musicians do anyway.
Sex, drugs and alcohol. It's a dangerous combination.
But the song sure sounds good.
