What do you think about Nicki Minaj?
My favorite is Anaconda.
She had a boy toy named Troy.
And he lived in Detroit.
He was keeping her stylish.
And that was real, real real.
They they had bananas on the record player.
And girls all up on each other.
And she was dressed to kill.
And they were pushing up daises.
