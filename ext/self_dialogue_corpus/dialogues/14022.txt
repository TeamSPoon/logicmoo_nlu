I  miss Lady Gaga's earlier work.
Her early work was good, but her new stuff isn't bad.
It's not as good as her early stuff though.
What's your favorite early song?
Either Poker Face or Just Dance.  How bout you?
Are we talking first album?
Yeah.
Oh, Papparazi off that album is my favorite.
I will say though that I am glad she's done with the theatrics.
I think that may just have to do with growing up a bit as well.
