I'm bored of all of the music on my computer. What should I listen to?
Have you ever heard of Royal Blood?
No! What kind of music do they play?
They are a rock band from England. They are very cool.
Are there a lot of people in the band?
No. There are actually only 2 members.
Wow. But they still have a big sound?
Absolutely. They totally rock and play garage rock that is loud and awesome.
What song should I listen to first?
Try "Little Monster". It is one of my favorites
