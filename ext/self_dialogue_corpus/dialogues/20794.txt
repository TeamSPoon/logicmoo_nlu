I'm so psyched about that new Aquaman movie.
I am, too! What's the release date?
Apparently it's December 2018.
Isn't there also a Justice League movie?
Yes. They actually wanted to make that before finishing Aquaman.
Which superheroes are supposed to be in that one?
Apparently it has Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman, Aquaman and some others.
Which others?
They're not as well known. I think it has Cyborg, Steppenwolf and Lex Luthor.
Lex Luthor. He sounds familiar.
He's a supervillain, actually. He has been around in comics for a long time.
I think I remember hearing about him in those older Superman movies.
Well, I think he was in the series that had Christopher Reeve in it.
Cool. Who played him?
That was Gene Hackman, actually.
I remember those movies. They were nothing like the superhero movies they make nowadays.
That's true. There have been some big changes in things like the costumes and special effects.
I wonder what led to the changes.
I know that a lot of people say that the Batman movie with Michael Keaton was when a lot of that stuff started to change.
I love that movie!
