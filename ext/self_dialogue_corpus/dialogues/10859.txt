Who is your favorite character in the Fast & Furious franchise?
I would have to say Dom.
He is a great character, why do you like him so much?
Well he's like a double sided blade one side is rough and tough the other side is soft and sentimental.
That's a very good point, I never thought of him like that.
Well he makes all these decisions to appear as this bad guy especially early on, then he always makes the morally right choice when it matters.
That's a very good point.  He is this brutal person yet so moral when it matters.
That's why he is my favorite.
I might have to watch the movies again.
Yeah you're making me nostalgic.
