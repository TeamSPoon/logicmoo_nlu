How do you feel about the current state of rap music?
In all honesty most of it is crap. Some of it is catchy but it's still pretty bad.
Oh? What song do you find catchy but is still bad?
Theres a ton of em, but one that really stands out to me right now is Panda by Desiigner.
I like the song, it's prety good I think.
Oh yeah? Can you tell what he was saying or did you need to look up the lyrics?
I had to research it.
Exactly thats what I hate. Most songs now have artist's mumbling about nothing. There is no substance anymore.
Theres a few songs out there with some good substance.
Oh yeah? Name three.
I honestly can't right now.
Can you name one at least?
That's current? No.
See? This is what I'm talking about. Rap in my opinion has gone down hill.
Yeah I can agree to a certain extent.
I miss really good songs that had an actual message. Now you have nothing but songs about money women and getting high.
Yeah I'd say the majority of it is just generic.
What I really don't like is the songs that do have great messages and such don't get to see the light of day.
What do you mean?
Most listeners don't like positive toned music. It's like they don't want to be bothered with a message and just want a nice beat.
