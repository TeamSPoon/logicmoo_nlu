Whats your favorite movie of all time?
I would say Sandlot
I think that was a great movie
As a kid we all loved it
It definitely stands the test of time
I wonder what happened with all those actors
I never really heard from many of them again.
Well they were child actors so who knows what could have happened
I bet they probably went on to film careers behind the screen.
Or used the money for college and got a different career alotgether
I dont think thats what happened
Can you even name any of the actors?
I know Dennis Leary was in it
And James Earl Jones
Yeah the others were all kids
Well my little one watches it still
Its a good bonding movie
The themes in it still are relevant
It was great acting for kids
They just acted like themselves
