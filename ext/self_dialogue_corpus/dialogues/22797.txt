What do you think of the Rocky movies?
I like them. I like Sylvester Stallone.
That Russian was tough. Felt bad when he got Apollo Creed.
Glad Rocky got him back.
Rocky is one of my husband's favorite movies.
I loved Rocky as a kid.
They should make some more Rocky movies.
I think it still has the popularity.
Yes me too.
What about Indiana Jones?
Yes that is pretty good too.
Did you see they are bringing a new one out?
Yes I can't wait to see it.
I has been so many years since a new one has been out.
I like Harrison Ford too.
A lot of his movies are good.
Was the last Indiana Jones one, the one with this son?
Yes I believe so.
That one was pretty good.
Yeah it was. Indie finding out he had a son was good.
