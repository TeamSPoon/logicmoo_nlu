Dude Lady Gaga is an amazing singer even a cappella.
I agree, and I don't even like poppy music.
I feel like her music almost transcends genre.
It kind of does, I can grove to it a bit and it's not my preferred genre.
Well I love her music and her so I may be biased.
I'm not. But her halftime show was kind of funny.
Haha, how so?
She kind of looked like spiderman coming down from the roof of the bowl.
Well it's a stadium but hah, that's funny. Did you see that online?
Yeah there were tons. But as they say, no press is bad press.
