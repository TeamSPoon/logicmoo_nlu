It's got a really cool set up which makes the story flow smoothly, and it compartmentalizes things.
What made the set up different from any other movie?
So the movie was broken apart into several chapters. In each chapter, the movie followed classic story telling etiquite.
Didn't Kill Bill follow a similar format- I think I know what you are talking about.
I am not sure- I never saw Kill Bill. Anyway, the first chapter is really about bringing the main characters together. There's a black guy who was a major in the union army.
Was the black guy Samuel L. Jackson- wait, that's a dumb question.
Yeah, it is and of course he was. Tarantino only uses top-billed actors in his movies, and you didn't see anyone else mentioned except Jackson, who was black.
He was a major in the army, okay. This was one of his western movies, right? When exactly did the movie take place?
It was set in a time period after the civil war.
Figures, Tarantino seems to have a thing for that time period.
Anyway, he was this dishonored major who was hellbent on killing white people. He earned a bad reputation after he accidentally killed 37 union soldiers during a configuration at a southern prisoner camp.
Tarantino  really likes to kill people in his movies, doesn't he?
I don't think it would be a Tarantino film without a bunch of killing and bloodshed.
Who else is in the set up.
Kurt Russel is playing this bounty hunter nicknamed "The Hangman." He is the one in charge of transporting the character played by Leigh.
I think I saw a commercial with him- he is getting old.
Yeah, this is sort of one of those "old men can be cool" sort of movies, like RED, and I have to admit, he was cool.
It couldn't have been an action film though with him in it. This isn't Tombstone.
No, but he didn't take anything off of anyone. Everywhere he went, he was the boss.
So he had an intimidating aura about himself? That sounds believable. Some old people are scary.
