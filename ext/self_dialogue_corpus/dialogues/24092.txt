what kind of movies do you like
I like foreign films
what kind of foreign films
mostly Asian movies
do you have to read captions
yes, you do
I dont think I would like that
Honestly, once you have done it for a while, you dont even think about it anymore
what are the names of some of them
I love Coffee Prince, Angel Eyes, And Doctor Stranger
are they hard to understand
not at all some of the customs there are different but again you get used to that
do you have any other reccomendations
a great classic is called Gu Family Book
why is it so good
it seems Asian movies tell stories differently, it is refreshing not knowing what is going to happen all the time
it sounds interesting
you can watch some on Netflix
that would be easy
if you decide you really like them we subscribe to Drama Fever, a great streaming channel
