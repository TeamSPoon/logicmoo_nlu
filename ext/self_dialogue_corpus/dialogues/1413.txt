So, what is your favorite sport if you had to pick one?
I would have to say football would probably be my choice.
Do you like the NFL or college football the best?
I love them both, but I would pick the NFL.
I love the NFL myself. My family and I are huge New York Giant fans.
Cool, I love the Broncos personally.
I bet you sure enjoyed that run that Peyton Manning took them on, huh?
I love Peyton and I am really glad that we were able to sign him. However, it was our defense that finally won us a Superbowl!
Yea, that was a pretty gifted defense that you guys had assembled the season before last.
I feel that Von Miller really got us that Superbowl.
Yea, he was very dominant and still is.
I think he is the best player in the league right now.
That is kind of hard to argue to be honest with you.
Being a Giants fan, you know all about Superbowl victories, right?
Well it has been a while at this point. I just wish we could get one more and I would be happy for a while!
Do you think the pieces are there?
Well, I know Eli Manning can get the job done. We have some other great talents as well; I am just not sure about the coaching right now.
I know what you mean there. Tom Coughlin is not walking through that door anytime soon!
I wish he was still the coach to be honest. I know he had some bad years, but he would have fixed things!
I agree, I mean he did win two Superbowls.
