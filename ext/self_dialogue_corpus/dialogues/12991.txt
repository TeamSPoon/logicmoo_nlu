Did you hear about what happened with the young Han Solo movie?
No, what happened?
They fired the directors.
Why did they do this?
Creative differences is the official reason.
Didn't they already start filming?
They sure did, I not sure how much they've done.
Hopefully it still will be a good movie.
Woody seems to think it will be good.
That's promising. Fingers crossed.
