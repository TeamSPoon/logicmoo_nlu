"Would you F@#$ me? I'd F@#$ me."
There is something wrong with you.
It's a quote from my favorite movie.
You're favorite movie is Silence of the Lambs?
Yeah, what's wrong with that? It's an amazing thriller.
It's just a disturbing thing to find out about your best friend.
Why do you think I'll eat your liver with some fava beans and a nice Chianti?
Well now I do. Though I will admit that Anthony Hopkins was incredible in that movie.
He's great in all his movies, but he is outstanding as a serial killer.
I liked him better in Fracture, somehow he was scarier than when he was eating people.
