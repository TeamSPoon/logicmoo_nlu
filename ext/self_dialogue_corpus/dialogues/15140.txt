I recently began listening to Country music again
Ewww, I hate country
When is the last time you listened to it?
I never have, Dolly Parton <shiver>
You should try giving it a shot, it's not the same
What do you mean?
These days it is a blend of country, christian and rock
What do you mean?
Just like I said, besides the guys are so freaking hot!
Oh really, name one
One, I can name plenty, Luke Bryan, Keith Urban
I've heard of them
Why do you think that is so?  They are mainstream baby!
Well, I guess.
Why don't you just give it a shot.  I guarantee you will be pleasantly surprised
If you say so
I say so.  Come on, give it a shot.
Ok, I will
Great!  Let me know how it goes and what you think
I will
