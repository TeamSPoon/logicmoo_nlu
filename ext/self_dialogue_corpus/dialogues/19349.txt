Did you listen to the new Fleet Foxes album?
No, I only know some of their older stuff.
It's a great album. I recommend it.
What's it called?
The Crack-Up, I think. The title song is great.
I'll have to give it a listen. I liked their older stuff.
Yeah, Mykynos is a great song.
All of their older albums are excellent. How does it compare?
It's quite similar but a little but more ambient.
That's surprising. I didn't think they could get slower.
Yeah. My favorite album is still their first one though.
You don't think the new one is better?
Not really. It's a little too slow for me.
You still I should check it out though?
Of course, if you like their music at all.
I wish I knew more bands like them.
I listen to a lot of folk, I could give some recommendations.
Like who?
Father John Misty has a nice sound.
Thanks, I'll check him out!
