Have you heard about the drama surrounding the new Han Solo movie?
No I haven't. What happened?
The orignal directors left the project with only a few weeks of prodcution remaining.
Wow, why did that happen?
Apparently the directors and Lawrence Kasdan kept clashing over the direction of the film.
So now what are they going to do?
Well, the studio brought in Ron Howard to finish directing the film.
Ron Howard? I guess he would be a pretty good fit.
Yeah, he's all class, and he obviously has a proven record as a good director.
I just hope the movie turns out okay in the end.
