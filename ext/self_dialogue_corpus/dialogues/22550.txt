Hey, are you a Star Wars fan?
Yes, I loved the original movies!
Have you seen the latest one? Rogue One?
No, not yet! Is it episode 8?
No, its actually set before the first film
Ah, cool, so what's it about?
It's about how the rebels get the plans for the death star
Sounds good!
Yeah, I wasn't that impressed to be honest. I wasn't a fan of many of the characters
Ah,that's probably Disney's influence!
I dunno, remember Jar Jar Binks?
Ha ha, Yeah! I don't think anyone liked that character!
Don't get too attatched to any of the characters in it!
Why? What happens?
Ah, I'm not gonna spoil it for you!
OK, I'll wait until I watch it. Are there any famous people in it?
I only recognized Forest Whitaker
Ah, yeah, he's good
Yeah, but he's not really one of the main characters
cool. I'll look forward to seeing it
