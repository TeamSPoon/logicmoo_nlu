Who is the coolest band ever?
I can think of some great bands that weren't cool.
Me too! But I'm wondering about the coolest.
Hmm, what about some of the early Punk Rock groups? The Ramones or something?
I'd actually say they weren't cool. They were too edgy to be cool, to nihilistic.
OK, I can get behind that. What about Bob Dylan?
VERY cool. But not really a band, just one musician.
OK, then what about Nirvana?
Nirvana was super cool back in their day.
It's hard to think of a band more cool than Nirvana, during the height of the Grunge era.
But at the same time, Kurt Cobain really struggled with success and popularity.
It makes sense, though - He was too cool to be popular!
Does being cool make your music better or worse, in general?
I'd probably say it doesn't matter, but that you don't have to be cool to make great music.
Agreed on that - Radiohead, for example.
Yeah, they don't seem like 'cool' people, really, but they make great music.
I think there are some artists who seem like they're more interested in being cool than making great music.
That's kind of a sad thing, I'd say.
Definitely, and a waste of whatever talent they have.
A cool band who makes great music is pretty awesome, though!
