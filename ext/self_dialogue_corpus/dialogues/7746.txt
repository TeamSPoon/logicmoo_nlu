What did you think of the Harry Potter series?
It sucks.
Why do you say that?
JK Rowling is a hack
What? Stop not liking things I don't like!
Never. She's a terrible writer and nothing after the fourth book is good.
What books?
You know, those things you read?
I've never read the books,I only watch the movies when they air on ABC Family every other weekend.
Then I truly pity you. How sad must your life be.
