I've been wondering this for a while. What's the difference between contemporary and legit?
In musicals you mean?
Yeah. Every time I hear someone say legit I think "too legit to quit" but that can't be right.
No, it's definitely not. It's partially about age and partially about style.
What do you mean?
Well, a lot of musicals including the ones most people think of when they think about Broadway were written in the 30s, 40s, and 50s.
Ok, I can follow that.
Have you ever heard popular music from the 40s?
I'm not sure that I have.
Listen to a little bit of it. Listen to Greta Garbo, or Judy Garland.
I've heard Judy Garland sing, the Wizard of Oz right?
That's her. When you listen to people from her time sing they sound sort of classical.
Classical? What do you mean?
Their voices have vibrato and they're rich and mellow sounding. They sing smooth, like in Somewhere Over the Rainbow.
Ok, so what does that have to do with musicals?
Musicals from those times were written with that popular style of singing in mind. If you've ever seen The Sound of Music on tv you've heard that same kind of style.
Ok, so that's old music style. Is that legit?
Yes. Legit singing is singing in that older, smoother, more classical style. The thing is musicals are written that way but sometimes they also use the current style of singing.
And that would be contemporary?
Right! Listen to The Sound of Music and then listen to Legally Blonde.  You'll hear the difference right away.
