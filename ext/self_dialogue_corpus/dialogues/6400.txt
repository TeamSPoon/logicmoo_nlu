Did you know Aladdin was the 31st Disney animated feature?
How interesting. I remember really enjoying seeing that film at the cinema.
It was based on the Arab-style folktale, Aladdin and the Magic Lamp.
The genie in Aladdin was very funny.
Yes, Robin Williams played the role of the genie.
No wonder, he was so funny.
Jasmine, I think, was the start of a new kind of Disney Princess.
In what way?
Jasmine was more rebellious against the royal life than other princesses.
I see what you mean; she had the spirit of adventure.
