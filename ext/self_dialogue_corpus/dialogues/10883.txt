Did you catch the latest Fast and Furious, The Fate of the Furious?
I caught it last night!
That's great, I caught it a few weeks ago. What were your impressions of it?
I really enjoyed it. I liked Charlize Theron as the villain. She is so smooth.
She's definitely one of my favorites and it was fun to see her in the Fast and the Furious universe now. Cypher!
I was hoping to see more action sequences from her because you know she can do some really cool stunts. They kept her as more of the intellectual villain.
I loved her interactions with Dom and how she was manipulating his motivations to turn against his family and team.
The whole movie I was trying to figure out what exactly did she have on him to make him turn considering he's probably the most loyal character in the series.
I know! I was guessing the whole way. I really enjoyed that mystery aspect of it, but let's not forget about the crazy action sequences!
I can't forget about that! That's why we go watch the Fast and the Furious!
