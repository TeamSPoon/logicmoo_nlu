What's your favorite nightmare on elm street sequel?
I would say Dream Warriors, actually like it nearly as much as the first one.
That would also be mine actually, felt it had the best plot.
Oh absolutely, also some of the best kills in the entire series.
Agreed it also gets points for bringing Nancy back.
Sure does, though the end when her father turns into Freddy was bittersweet.
Yeah didn't See that coming the first viewing, though should've.
I mostly did, still was painful to watch.
Would would you rank Heather Langenkamp among screen queens?
Certainly up there, probably the best of the modern ones.
One of the few comparisons I would make might be Neve Campbell.
Wasn't all that into Scream, so don't rate her as highly as some. Neither can tough Jamie Lee Curtis or Karen Black.
Oh that goes without saying, they don't make them like they used to.
Agreed the classics are deemed classics for a reason.
Absolutely and then when filmmakers try to replicate it, they tend to fail. See nightmare elm street reboot for an example.
Or Rob Zombie's Halloween 1 and especially 2 what a travesty that was.
Not sure what he was thinking Devils Rejects showed he could direct a gem.
Unfortunately looks like it was a flash in the pan.
Yeah sadly so, anyway have to go.
Talk to you again soon.
