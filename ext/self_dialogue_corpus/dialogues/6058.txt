Did you see the new Beauty and the Beast movie?
Yes! I loved the new live action version!
I thought the actors were great. Emma Watson was a perfect Belle.
Yes, her singing really surprised me. What did you think about Beast?
He was good, too. Did you know he was the guy from Downton Abbey?
Really? I didn't realize that! I couldn't tell under the costume.
Yeah, that's when I realized it. The effects when he changed back were really great.
You're right; the special effects were really well done, and so were the songs.
Yes! I loved that they included the original songs and added new ones, too.
My favorite song was the one by Celine Dion in the credits. That was a nice touch.
