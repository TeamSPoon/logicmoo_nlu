It is one of the most iconic rock album covers ever!

Yes,when I can't sleep at night at 3:am I like to check out people in England walking on Abbey Road.
Which Beatle walked barefoot across Abbey Road?
Why it was Sir Paul McCartney!
Has there ever been a more famous walk?
Not that I can think of.
It seems the Beatles were not only great rock group,but designed great album covers as well.
Yep,the Beatles were special and we will never see their likes again.
