Yes, I am. Why?
I mean a real fan, you know from his earlier work.
Yup, Big fan!

You know he was embarrassed about some of his earlier work and had it recalled.

Yeah, he did some real out of the box stuff that I love.
I know. He was way ahead of his time.
He was a musical genius for sure.
Right? Where do you come up with a concept for "Billy the Mountain"?
Ethel, wanna get a cup of coffee?
Howard Johnsons!, Howard Johnsons!
...the first noteworthy piece of..
...real estate that was destroyed...

Too funny man, too funny.
