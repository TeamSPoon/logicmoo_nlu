Do you think there is something special about movies from the 80's and the 90's?
What do you mean by special?
Well it seems like they are from an era that is a hundred years ago, not a few decades ago.
Like the quality is bad in them?
No I mean everyone seems much more relaxed, confident and people just overall smiled more.
I think I know what your saying, something like a time before the war on terror where people were more trusting?
Yes, exactly. It seemed like there was a period of time around there were race was not a big deal, sexuality was not a big deal and people got a long much better.
Okay, I see what your saying now. Yes, I totally agree.
I think that movies are representative of the time periods they were made in and the movies in the 90's were much more happy go lucky.
Have any specific films in mind?
Hm.. I don't know. Maybe something like 'While you were sleeping' or 'Santa Clause' with Tim Allen.
Also there was 'Hook'. That one is one of my favorites, its a classic.
For sure, I know there are others that are probably more representative of the idea I'm trying to convey but I can't remember them off the top of my head.
Hmm.. Well they will come to you. Just don't overthink it.
Anyway, what era is your favorite period of films?
I like 50's the most.
Oh really? Why is that?
Well there were stars like Elvis Presely and Maryilin Monroe and there is something about them, like they have a sparkle in their eye.
I know what you mean, its almost as if they knew something secret and important and it gave them a broader perspective.
I think they had an insight into the future as well, they knew that they were embodying something that captures peoples attention and would do so for decades maybe even centuries.
