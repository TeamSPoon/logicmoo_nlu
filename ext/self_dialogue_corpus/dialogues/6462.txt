My students are obsessed with the Disney movie Frozen?
Oh yeah? I feel out of touch, I know nothing about it.
Well, this is one of the benefits of teaching. You stay hip to the young people stuff.
That's 100% true. What's Frozen all about?
I don't actually know, but they're obsessed with one of the songs from the soundtrack.
Would I know it?
Possibly. It's called "Let It Go" and it repeats that refrain many times.
That's honestly not ringing a bell.
You'll have to visit my classroom sometime soon.
Only if you're screening Disney movies!
