I love that song!
What song?
The one that's playing on the radio.
I can't make it out.
It's the old Kenny Roger's song, "The Gambler."
No kidding?
Yeah. I used to sing that song every day back in high school.
Every day?  It's a good song, but singing it every day...?
I fancied myself somewhat of a maverick and a great poker player. The song was my theme song!
It still suits you. Perfect song about an old guy sitting around reminiscing and constantly telling others his opinions.
