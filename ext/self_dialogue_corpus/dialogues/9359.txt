I heard some shocking news today about Prodigy.
Yeah from Mobb Deep? What happened?
He just died in Las Vegas. They don't really know how he died yet.
What? Wow. That guy was a legend.
Yeah. He was only 42 years old. His real name was Albert Johnson.
Wow! He had been battling sickle cell anemia all his life.
They think it might be related to that. He was hospitalized a few days before.
I had Mobb Deep's album called "Juvenile Hell" and it was great.
Yeah, that was back in 1993. It's terrible that he's gone.
Yeah, too young and too soon.
