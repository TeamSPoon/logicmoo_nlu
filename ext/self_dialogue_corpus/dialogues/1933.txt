Have you looked at the NFL schedule this year for the Panthers?
Yeah I think they'll do  better than last year.
Hopefully, because the schedule is a little easier than usual.
Yeah I think Cam Newton will have a good year.
Me too, but I think the Patriots are still the team to beat.
Oh definitely, it seems like that every year.
But there's always some surprise team that comes out of nowhere.
Yeah I wonder who that will be.
I doubt it's anyone in the NFC South.  I think the Packers could make some noise.
yeah the Falcons blew it last year. It could be Packers and Patriots.
I hope it's two new teams this year in it.
Do you think McCaffrey will start and play well?
yeah he looks like the complete package and could complement Cam Newton well.
Yea he could be dangerous.  Who else could be good?
I think we need Kelvin Benjamin to lose some weight.
Oh yeah for sure, I don't know how he gained so much weight.
I hope he's mentally into it.
yeah he is the difference maker.  Are you going to any games this year?
I am going to the first home game, maybe you could join me.
Sure I'd love that.
