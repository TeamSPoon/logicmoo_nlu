What is the greatest song from the 1980s?
Wow, that's a tough one. Rock or Pop?
Anything. Whatever you think is the best song.
I don't know. Something by Wham?
You're not really trying. Try to think of a song that encapsulates the whole decade.
Thriller by Michael Jackson?
A worthy choice. It had an awesome video, but I am not sure the song itself stands up.
It's still fun to dance to.
I am not saying that it is not. It just doesn't seem like the anthem of the 1980s to me.
This is hard, there were too many things going on in the 80s.
That's true, we had the cold war, denim, the british invasion, punk rock, heavy metal, hair bands, power ballads, rap and hip-hop going mainstream.
So much stuff. How can one song capture it all.
I am not sure. That's your challenge.
How about Born in the USA. It captured post Vietnam Americana with hints of Folk and Rock, all wrapped up in a denim jacket.
Good Choice, but I don't think we are there yet.
Winds of Change by the Scorpions?
A post cold-war power ballad by a hair band. It captured the emotions of a generation. However, it came out in 1990
What? What about We didn't start the Fire by Billy Joel? It cover's every topic up to 1989.
True, but it's not solely 1980s. The correct answer is We are the World.
Every 1980s pop and rock star standing together for charity? Okay, I concede. You win.
