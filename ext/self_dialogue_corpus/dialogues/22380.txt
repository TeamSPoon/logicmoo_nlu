Have you seen the movie, "Split"?
No. Is it any good?
Yes. I think it's one of the best movies of the year.
Really? It's an M. Night Shayamalan movie, isn't it?
Yes, but this one is really good -- unlike some of his recent films that were not so great.
What's it about?
It's about a guy with multiple personalites that has a secret monstrous personality called the beast.
Which actors are in it? Are there any major stars in it?
There aren't any A-list stars in it, but the acting is very good. The main character is played by James McAvoy. He does an amazing job portraying over a dozen different characters.
Is it scary?
I would say, for most people, it's not really scary, but it's suspenseful and the plot is pretty interesting.
Who else is in it besides McAvoy?
There's this really cute girl that plays the main protagonist. The actress's name is Anya Taylor-Joy.
I've never heard of her, or at least, I don't know her by name.
She's a new actress and she looks like a teenager. She was in the movie, "The Witch."
I didn't see that one.
It was weird, but good. She is supposed to star in the upcoming New Mutants movie.
I'm still not sure if I want to see Split. It sounds like one of those movies with a lot of dialog but not much action.
If you are the type that needs a lot of constant violence and nudity to keep you engaged in a movie, then you definitely won't like it. If you have slightly above-average intelligence, you will probably like it.
Okay then. Maybe I'll give it a shot.
