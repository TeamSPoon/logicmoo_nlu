I often think I was born in the wrong decade.  I really enjoy the music of groups like Simon and Garfunkel.
Isn't their early stuff sort of more like a do-wap group?
I do think that is how they got their start.
I've personally always thought that Art Garfunkel had the better voice.
I agree but Paul Simon had the more successful solo career.  I don't know if he is more marketable or perhaps it is his song writing ability.
He is an amazing song writer.  What is your favorite song?
From when they were together or solo?
When they were together but you can tell me both actually.
I know it's cliche but I really like Sounds of Silence.  There is something haunting about it.
I don't disagree but I really like the Boxer.  I remember being scared of the song when I was little because it had these really loud parts in it.
Oh you mean the drums.  Did you know they set them up in front of an elevator shaft to get that sound out of them?
I think I had heard that before.  I also read that they recorded part of it in a church.
The chorus is strange though.  They say Lie la Lie over and over again like they couldn't think of anything better.
Oh I read about that in an interview Paul Simon did once.  It was a placeholder so that he could think of something better.
I guess he didn't come up with anything?
No and I think the producers liked the sound.  I heard some people thought it was intentional - talking about how life can be a lie.
Well, that happens all the time.
True but Simon said it was just something he said as he was writing the song and then it stuck.
I wonder how many times something like that happens.
Maybe we could look it up.  I'm sure lots of song writers use place holders but never think of anything.
