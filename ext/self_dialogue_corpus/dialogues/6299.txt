Did you hear Cars 3 is out this weekend?
Already? I had no idea!
We should go see it.
What time do you want to go?
It doesn't matter, but I'm exicted to see it!
I heard it was sad.
What do you mean it's sad? Does something happen to Lightning McQueen?
I don't know it's just what I heard.
I'm avoiding the internet for this one because I don't want to ruin it.
That's fine I still want to see it!
