Did you watch Creed?
That's the new Rocky movie right?
Well Sylvester Stallone is in it as Rocky, but it's not technically Rocky.
Yes, i saw it.
What did you think?
I thought it was really good.
I thought Adonnis Creed was an interesting choice for a main character.
Yes, interesting that they choose Apollo's son.
The wife from the Cosby show was Adonnis' mom!
I know!  That was cool.
I missed hearing the Rocky theme music though.
Me too.
It's just not the same without "Gonna Fly Now".
No, it's not.
They still did a pretty good training montage though.
Yeah, it was pretty good even without the original music.
How about Rocky battling cancer!?
That was wild.  I felt so bad for him.
He beat it though.
Yeah he did. Stays to stay alive for Creed 2.
