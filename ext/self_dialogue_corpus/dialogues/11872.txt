Yes officer, I was visiting my friend Eleanor Rigby who lives on Penny Lane.
That’s near the Beatles Strawberries Fields Forever am I correct?
Yes, we had tickets for the Magic Mystery Tour but we encountered Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Heart’s gang.
And then what happened?
They said they were Fixing A Hole for Martha My Dear?
And that’s when all Helter Skelter broke out?
Well, The Girl Sexy Sadie said they started working on the hole the night before
The office thought silently to himself before he spoke...
And Your Bird Can Sing right? So how many of the Beatles songs do you think the two of us have mentioned?
No Reply. The End.
