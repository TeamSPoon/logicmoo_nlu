Do you remember when you could turn on the radio and listen to the top 40?
Casey Casum, and wait for your song to hit record?
Yes! I used to do that all the time.  He would always talk during the intro.
Ha! Yes that would drive me bonkers.
I would listen to those songs over and over.
I could still tell you exactly what he said during the intros because I would play it over and over.
I think there was a point where I would just call and request the song then listen for it.
Me too.  It took longer but you could get the whole song, unless you had a talkative DJ.
Yup, that was before Napster.
That was back when you had to really work for your stolen songs.
I don't think it was a problem then.
No people who are lazy would just break down and go buy the album.
The thing with napster was that lazy people could still be lazy and not have to spend money on buying the songs.
True, I have to agree with the artists on that one.
Me too, it was stealing.
It definitely wasn't a victimless crime.
Intellectual property is still property even if it is virtual.
True.  The whole music landscape has changed.
It is still changing everyday.
We literally have any song we want at our fingertips.
