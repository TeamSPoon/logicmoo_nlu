Do you like The Sixth Sense?
Yes.
Did you think it would end that way?
I had no idea Bruce Willis's character was dead.
That was a cool twist.
I like twist endings in thrillers.
I think the director of The Sixth sense is one of the best at twist endings.
I agree.
Did he also make Signs?
Yes. That is one of the best thrillers ever made.
