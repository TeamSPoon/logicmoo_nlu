Who's the king of rock and roll?
Elvis,of course.
Man I wish I,saw him rock in his heydays!!
Would have killed to see him.
He opened the door for rock music and rock bands.
Absolutely correct about that.
Too bad he died so young.
Yes it is but his music lives on forever.
I play his stuff a lot!
He's on all of my playlists
