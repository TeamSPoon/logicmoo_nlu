How do you feel about Eleanor Rigby?
It's okay I suppose, but a little too out there for my tastes.
So you like the more traditional Beatles stuff?
I do indeed, I'm partial towards something like I want to hold your hand.
See that's where we differ, I get bored sometimes with their more traditional stuff.
I just feel some of their less traditional stuff was akin to them going off the deep end.
I can certainly see how it wouldn't be for everyone, and don't get me wrong I still enjoy all their stuff, at least to some extent.
Who's your favorite Beatle?
John Lennon hands down.
I'm a George Harrison person myself, also really like Ringo Star.
