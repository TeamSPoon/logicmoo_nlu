Can you believe Gaga ever had a weight issue?
It is hard to believe she looks so petite.
It is weird to think of her as fat kid, but guess she was.
I think it makes me like her more.
Why would that make you like her more?
I think because she is really real. Very human to struggle with weight.
I do like that she is honest about it. Probably helps some girls out there knowing she went through issues too.
Exactly. I was a concert and she addressed this about herself and I thought that was very brave and helpful to many.
That is cool. She had so much impact on her fans nice she sends out positive helpful messages.
I respect her a lot for that and her talent of course.
