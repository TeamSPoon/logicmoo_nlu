What's up with Adele? She hasn't been out in public lately has she?
Didn't you hear? Adele said she may never tour again.
NO!! Why?!?!
I think its because she wants to spend more time with her family.
I can understand that. but to just make a blanket statement like that?
I doubt she'll "never tour again", I do expect that she's going to take a really long break.
Well, why not just say "I'm taking a really long break?"
Because if her fans think that she's never going to tour again, if and when she does, it'll be a sell out tour.
Yeah, everyone would want to be there for a comeback tour.
Besides, there's lots of artists who say they'll never tour again,but sure enough when they need the money, they tour.
I wonder if this means that Adele is done making new albums as well?
I would venture a guess that it will be a while before that were to happen, if she does release anything new.
Yeah, I guess you can't really have an album without a tour.
Exactly.I bet she'll still do guest spots on television and sing on other people's albums. I don't think she'll be an actual recluse.
Its just disappointing, when I saw her live, I was totally blown away. She puts on an amazing show!
Well, I imagine that doing world tours where you're constantly singing and traveling has to be really draining to a person.
Plus, her kid is getting older. So, I bet she wants some stability for him.
She does seem like a really good mom, very involved and very caring.
That's probably the biggest reason for not touring, I bet she just wants to have her kid grow up like a normal person.
I'd lay money on her touring again once the kid is a bit more grown up. Right now, she probably just wants to be a normal mom
