Did you hear about Chris Cornell?
I did, it's so sad.
They think it was suicide, which is just awful.
Another grunge legend gone too soon. Soundgarden were icons of that era.
Yeah, they were one of the big 4 Seattle bands in the early 90s.
What were the others? Nirvana, Pearl Jam and... ?
Alice in Chains, with Layne Staley on vocals.
Of course! I remember when he died too. So awful.
Eddie Vedder of Pearl Jam is the only one still around, and he's still making music.
I love his solo stuff too - different from Pearl Jam but still great.
