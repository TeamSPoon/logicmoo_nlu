Who is your favorite hockey team?
I am a Nashville fan.  What about you?
I like the Pittsburgh Penguins.
Are you a bandwagon fan?
No, I've been a fan my entire life.  I was born there.
Oh I see.
Are you a bandwagon fan?  Nashville is playing well right now.
I'm from Tennesse.
So you're fairly new to hockey...
Yeah I played roller hockey as a kid, so I got into ice hockey as soon as Nashville got a team.
They're in the Western Conference Finals now.  How did that happen?
Pekka Rinne man!
Yeah he's been amazing.  I would be afraid to have to play the Predators right now.
Well your team is the defending champion...
Yeah, that last game against Ottawa was a nail-biter.  Unfortunate ending.
Another OT game, huh?
Yeah, can you believe all of these OT games?
Amazing.  Each team has really put up a fight this year.
Except for Chicago!
Haha, yeah man!
