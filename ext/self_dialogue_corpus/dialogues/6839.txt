What cartoon should I take my nephew to?
Cars 3!
Oh, is that out?
Yeah, it just came out last weekend. It's really fun!
I think he was too young for the first one, so I don't know if he knows about it.
He doesn't have to have seen the first one. He will love it!
He does like race cars a lot.
The music is fun and the voices are good, too.
Ok, this sounds like a hit!
Let me know how he likes it!
