Have  you gotten any new music lately?
Yeah I bought some Sia music on Amazon. Chandelier.
Oh  Sia, I like her music.
Its a little different, I know.
Do you buy music on Amazon or iTunes?
Both actually. I bought a lot of American Idol music on iTunes.
That's great.   American Idol produced lots of awesome singers.
Yeah.  Who do you like?
Carrie Underwood.
She's great, I like her.
How about you?
Carrie, Kelly Clarkson, and Fantasia.
All the good female singers!
Well there are some good guy singers too.
For sure. Like Caleb Johnson.
Yes and Trent Harmon is great!
I love Kelly Clarkson's Piece by Piece.
Me too.  Made me cry.
She cried too when she premiered that song.
Its an emotional song she wrote.
