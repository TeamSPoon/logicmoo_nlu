Hey! Do you know when the next NFL game will be?
Which one do you mean?
There's many NFL games in the upcoming season.
I'm referring to the first game of the season.
Oh, you mean the one with San Diego Chargers.
Yes indeed! That's my favorite team actually.
Oh really? I don't like the Chargers.
Really? Why not the Chargers.
The players in the Chargers don't play well.
Well I'm from San Diego so I support my local team.
I'm from Chicago so obviously I don't support your local team.
I don't have any rival teams though.
The next game will be on the 15th then.
Oh what time?
The NFL game starts at 7 p.m.
Game on! I'm gonna drink a beer every time the Chargers score.
Great idea! Beer and NFL go together.
I love NFL tailgate parties
NFL tailgates are the best
Tailgating is the best experience in my college frat! Go Chargers!
