Why did The Beatles break up?
I don't know, I've heard people blame Yoko.
I've heard that too, I don't think that's fair.
Yeah, it's totally denying John agency to make decisions.
Exactly, it's ridiculous. It's like Yoko is being totally scapegoated.
I know. John was an adult and could have decided to stay in The Beatles, I've seen no evidence that Yoko forced his hand.
It's sad they broke up.
I know, think of what could have been if you take the best tracks from their solo albums you can put together a few great records.
Yeah, but maybe they wouldn't have been as inspired had they not broken up.
I agree because the whole is greater than the sum of its parts, so it could be better or worse. For sure different.
