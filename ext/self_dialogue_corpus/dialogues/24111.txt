What are your thoughts on the new Mummy movie?
I'm really not sure. I like it but I don't at the same time.
I completely agree with you.
I heard that there is supposed to be a bunch of monster movies after this.
Yeah that's what I heard to.
Do you know what monsters are supposed to be in the future movies?
I heard that Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde is supposed to possibly be.
I think that is a terrible idea.
Yes I agree with you man. Have you heard of any?
No but I wonder if Wolfman is going to be as well.
Yeah that's a really good guess, actually. I'm not sure either.
Have you got a chance to see the new movie yet?
I only got to see about the first 20 minutes before I got a call to going to work.
Wow that really stinks. How did you least like the first 20 minutes?
I thought it was actually really good to be honest.
Was the acting done well?
Yes it is done very well, but you know how much I like Tom Cruise.
Oh that is very true. I think he's a great actor.
I thought the woman who played the mummy did a great job as well.
Yeah she is a great actress. I really loved her in Kingsman.
