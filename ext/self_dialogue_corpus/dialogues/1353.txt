I can't see the television!
You don't want to see this!
What happened? What?
Cleveland scored again.
No!  Not again!
And they didn't even use their first string quarterback!
Are you kidding me? Who was it?
They used that Heisman-winning QB.
Johnny Football?
Johnny Football!
I thought he was canned.
Apparently not. Rehab maybe?
I guess. Why is it that so many NFL football players get a little money and then go off the deep end?
It's not just football players.  THis happens with players from alot of different types of sports.
Yeah, but football players always seem to get a bad rap.  Why is that?
A violent game breeds violent people maybe? Or maybe it's Jealousy...
Jealousy is probably a part of it, and self-control is no something you are born with, but I think it is because players bring attention to themselves when they are a 400-lb offensive lineman or the starting quarterback of a professonal football team, with a gazzillion dollar contract. Hard to hide your indescretions when you are famous.
I suppose so.  But you never hear about all the good things these players do off the field!
Like what?
Like all the charities they start or support. I wish society valued that as much as who can throw a ball the farthest!
