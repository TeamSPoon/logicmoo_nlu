Have you listened to the new Kendrick Lamar album yet?
My friend showed me a few songs. What's your favorite song on the album?
I really like the song, "LOYALTY. FEAT. RIHANNA."
Let me guess. The song features Rihanna?
[sarcastically] How'd you know?
There are a few other guest artists featured, right?
Yeah! Believe it or not, U2 is on one song.
Kendrick Lamar and U2? What do you think of that song?
The two styles actually come together well. U2's always been political, as is Kendrick Lamar.
What are they talking about in the song?
A lot about the state of America--our current politicians, race relations, wealth divisions, and more.
Not just party music, is it?
No way! Kendrick Lamar wants to express very relevant topics through his music.
I heard that the album's at the top of the Billboard chart.
All fourteen of the songs on the album are in the top 100!
The whole album?
Yep, the whole album!
He deserves this success. Usually music that popular is just silly and shallow!
Don't get me started on Miley Cyrus' "Malibu."
Nope, we're not going there.
