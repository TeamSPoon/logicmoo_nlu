How do you feel about some of the  obscure rules governing the NFL?
I don't know any of them. Enlighten me.
NFL agreement says that players must be reimbursed up to $122 per day for food expenses that the team doesn't provide meals while on the road.
That sounds like a lot of money to me. But I guess it isn't if you figure it out with tips included.
Well get this if you are one of the big boys who is overweight by their standards a player may have to pay up to $630 a pound that he is over the limit.
What!!! Wow if that isn't motivation to keep in shape I don't know what is!
Here's another one that is not so harsh. Players are guaranteed 4 days off  a month
Sounds reasonable i guess.
The unsportsmanlike  conduct one is kind of iffy to me.
How so?
Well it obviously covers things like aggressive  behavior that results in injury. But excessive  celebration  is listed as mental hurt.
.That seems a little ridiculous.
I am with you on that one. because it is left up to the referee's interpretation of what is too much
.I think that is totally ridiculous rule.
Yes because what if for some reason that referee doesn't personally like that player
Then biased would be involved.
Exactly. Also what about the fact who doesn't want to express their happiness at doing well.
That is very true. Seems like they want to take the fun out of it for some people.
What's really dumb is that the fans enjoy the spectacle so why rob them of that.
Especially  considering  how much they pay for tickets
