Did you see Tool last night?!
They were in town? I had no idea!
They were! And they put on a great show.
I'm so bummed I missed it now.
Yeah you would have really liked it.
What songs did they play?
A lot of new ones, as well as old ones.
Did they play The Pot?
They did! They also played Sober.
Thats one of my all time favorites.
Mine too! It does play on the radio though.
Yeah I do hear it an awful lot.
I wish they would go on tour more often.
I think they have a lot of stuff going on.
Yeah they tend to tour with other bands.
I want to see them the next time I see them.
I'll get you tickets to go!
Awesome! Thanks so much.
No problem, you'd really love to see them.
I know I will!
