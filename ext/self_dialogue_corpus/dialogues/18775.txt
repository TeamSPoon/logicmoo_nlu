My nephew was in a boy band called Dream Street.
What is your nephew's name?
Greg Raposo
I remember him, he was with four other boys too.
Yes they were Chris Trousdale, Matt Ballinger, Frankie Galasso, and Jesse McCartney.
I still listen to Jesse McCartney.
Me too and when he comes to NY, I usually go to his concerts.
Is your nephew still singing?
Yes he is now singing with his sisters doing small concerts at venues.
What type of music?
All types, but mainly soft rock.
What are the other boys besides Jesse doing?
Well Matt got married and had his own band for awhile, but I am not sure what he is doing now.
What about the one with the spikes?
Chris, he is living in CA and is still trying hard to have a career in music or dancing.
That is cool, he was so cute.
Frankie has had a great career also.  He was in Jersey Boys.
What role did he play.
He was Joe Pesci and the under study for Frankie Vallie.
That is awsome..................I miss Dream Street.
