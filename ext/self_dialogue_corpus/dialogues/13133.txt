Who is your favorite Star Wars bounty hunter?
I have to go with Boba Fett. He had the best outfit and the coolest gear.
Bossk was definitely the ugliest.
That dude is like half komodo dragon or something.
You think his bite is just as deadly?
I'd say so. With a mug that ugly you know his dental health is pretty bad.
Wasn't one of the bounty hunters in Empire a droid?
Yes, IG-88, a sentient droid without a master.
I think R2D2 is also a free spirit. He's always kind of just doing his own thing.
I agree, he definitely has a lot of spunk to him. He's by far my favorite droid.
