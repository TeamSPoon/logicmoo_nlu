What's your favorite scene in all of the Fast & Furious movies?
I would say, it was when they went under the 18 wheeler. That started it all. You?
The bridge jump was the best! It got my adrenaline going.
Which car do you think was better, the Skyline or the 1970 Dodge Charger?
Obviously, I would choose the Skyline. But that Dodge Charger is a classic.
I think the Dodge Charger beats them all. It's a lot of American muscle.
I feel like Japanese cars are better built, and last much longer.
If you take care of the Dodge Charger, it can last just as long.
What's the best stunt in the movie?
I would say the Abu Dhabi Car Jump was awesome.
