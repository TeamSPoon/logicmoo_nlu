Quarterbacks these days are so babied by the league.
What do you mean?
I just think there's too many rules in place to protect the quarterback at all costs. It makes the game worse.
I think they have to make rules for the quarterback because their safety is at risk.
How are quarterbacks in more danger than the average player?
If you think about it, quarterbacks are basically sitting ducks when they're just standing in the pocket looking for a passer.
Yeah, I know, but that comes with the terrirtory. It's not like these guys aren't getting paid for it.
But I don't think it's just a matter of being paid for it. They also have to think how it affects the game if quarterbacks get injured often.
To me, it's a part of the game.
I can see where you're coming from, but I also see where the NFL is coming from.
It's just too many rules to protect the quarterback at the expense of the defensive players' abilities to play.
I think the rules are fine. Defensive players are still able to hit the quarterback.
Not like they used to. These days, defensive players can get fined or penalized just for sneezing at a quarterback.
I think that it actually makes defensive players quicker and smarter when they have to play within the new rules.
How so?
When defensive players can't just go all out to hit a quarterback, they have to think about strategy.
I disagree. It limits them.
I think defensive players all of a sudden have to think about approaching the quarter with more skills than just brute force.
Personally, I would rather see the old rules.
I just want to see quarterbacks playing for a whole season even if it means babying them.
