I just got done watching Moana, have you seen it yet?
Is that the Disney movie with the kid and the ocean?
Yes, it was really good, actually made me tear up a bit.
Moana, The Rock is in it too isnt he?
He is, he made for a great animated character!
Does he actually sing in it, I know Disney has a lot of singing.
He does sing actually! I was surprised by it.
Surprised? Does that mean he was actually good at it?
He wasn't the worst, but he wasn't the best.
I might have to check the movie out then.
I can rent it tonight, if you ant to come over and watch it.
You want to see it again, already?
I do! Its so good, I would watch it a couple of times.
Well, if its that good, yeah I will come over later and watch it.
Awesome! Come by around 8, ill have some popcorn and wine ready!
Alright, I'll bring over some movie candy too! What is the girls name who plays Moana?
Her real name is Auli'i Cravalho, she has a amazing voice, only 15 when she recorded.
Oh wow, I heard her sing on Dancing With The Stars, she was great.
Yes!!! You'll love her singing on her other songs as well.
Cant wait, ill be over around 8 tonight!
