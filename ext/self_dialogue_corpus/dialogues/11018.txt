Do you follow Hockey?
Yes, for sure. My favorite are the Philly Flyers. Who is your favorite?
I am a big fan of Canadian leagues. Do you follow any of them?
Yes, I do. Not as much, my favorite is the CHL.
Oh, I follow them too. Did you see the London Knights won?
Yes I did, Surprisingly. Almost as surprisingly as the Stanley cup finals are going.
Oh yeah, did you catch the last one?
The predators vs. The Ducks?
Yeah. That one, the predators won.
It was a close game though, three to two.
Are you going to watch the Penguins game tonight?
Yes, I have been watching almost every game this year. Are you?
I hope I can. Who do you think will win?
I think the Penguins have a good chance. How about you?
For sure the Senators. Did you see the predators play again tomorrow?
Yeah, I have  a game night planned for that. We are going to play cards and watch the game.
Sounds fun, so rooting for the predator then?
Of course, how about you?
I think the Ducks have it in the bag. You think they may take the whole thing home?
I think the predators will win the cup this year.
