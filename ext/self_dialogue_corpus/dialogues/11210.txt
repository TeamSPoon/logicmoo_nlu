Have you tried any of the fashion subscription services?
What do you mean?
I subscribe to a fashion subscription service and they send me clothes to wear every month.
What have they sent you?
This month I got two of the most beautiful black leggings.
That's so cool! Did they fit well?
Yes, they did. One pair had leather on the front so they are gorgeous for daytime or night.
I love the sound of those.
I also got the best sweater from French Connection.
I love the way French Connection fits. They cut their clothes beautifully.
I know. The one I have is grey and the sleeves are striped black and white.
Oh, so they go perfectly with the black legging you have?
Yes, they do. I actually wore them with the leggings with the leather fronts and a black jacket.
I bet that looked awesome.
It did, and it was very comfortable too.
I used to have the most beautiful sweater from French connection.
What did it look like?
It was blue and soft and has an owl wearing glasses on the front.
I think I know which one you mean. It was fitted?
Yes, I loved it.
