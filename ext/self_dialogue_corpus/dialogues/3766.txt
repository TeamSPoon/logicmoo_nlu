Have you heard of any good thriller films coming out?
I know they are remaking the movie IT.
With the killer clown?
Yep, I bet it is scary.
The older one scared me so much.
In the scene with clown head in the fridge, they did not tell the actors, their reaction was real.
That is so scary! I hope it lives up to the old one.
Liam Neesan has one coming out around the same time.
What is it called?
The commuter, I bet it is scary, traveling always is.
