I just saw a trailer for a new movie.
What movie?
I had never heard of this one but the name of the movie is The Black Ghiandola.
The Black Ghiandola? That is a new one on me.
I was thinking the same thing when I watched the trailer.
Alright, so who is in it? What is about ?
Johnny Depp, David Lynch, J.K. Simmons and Laura Dern to name a few.
So, what is The Black Ghiandola?  Is it a mad man obsessed with a musical instrument?
You are so way off.
Then what is it?
The Black Ghiandola  is a  story of a young man trying to find and protect the girl he loves in a zombie apocalypse.
Zombies? Haven't we had enough of those types of movies?
It is a short film is and the dream of 16-year-old cancer patient Anthony Conti who is facing stage IV adrenal cortical cancer.
Really?
Yeah. Conti plays a young man who risks his life saving a young girl he has grown to love after his family has been killed during a zombie apocalypse.
Romance in a zombie apocalypse. Typical.
They say  Conti wrote he script with Scott Kosar  and Wash Westmoreland.
Scott Kosar  of the “Texas Chainsaw Massacre?”
Yes. It took five days to shoot the film in which Depp gets munched on.
No. Johnny Depp becomes dinner for a zombie?
