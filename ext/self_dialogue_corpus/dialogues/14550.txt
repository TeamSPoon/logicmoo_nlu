Did you see that game between Duke and UCLA?
Yeah, that was a fantastic game.
Grayson was on fire last night.
I know, he's such a powerful player.
I wish I could slam dunk like him.
He makes it look so easy!
He was hitting 3 pointers all night.
He is super talented.
That team really looks like they are outpracticing all their opponents.
For sure!
I'd love to see a home game.
We should do it.
Seeing Duke play live is so exciting.
They have a great team this season.
Coach Davis is such a strong leader.
I wish the WIldcats had him when I was in school.
There's a game on tonight.
Wanna come to my place and watch it?
That'd be great! I'd love to see it.
Great - I'll make nachos!
