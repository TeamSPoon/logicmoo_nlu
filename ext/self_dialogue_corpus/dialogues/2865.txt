How do you feel about the Patriots as an organization?
I love their consistency, but I hate their individual parts.
Yes, I think many people share your view.
I think it would be hard not to see that they are great, but that they steal and cheat to get results.
Do you think Bill Belichick is the greatest coach of all time?
Probably, but I still don't like him.
Do you think that Tom Brady is the best quarterback ever?
Again, he most likely is, but I feel disappointed that he is.
I get what you're saying about being impressed by them, but still feeling let down by them.
It shouldn't be this way, and I should be enjoying their dominance and impressive control of the league for years.
They kind of make it hard to cheer for them.
Yes, and they are boring with how they win.
Well I think a win is a win, and ugly football still wins championships.
No doubt, and some football purists would call their gameplan genius.
So when do you think they will fall as a dynasty?
That's easy, whenever Belichick or Brady retires.
So no one else could fill their shoes?
No, they have a perfect fit and understanding of each other, and no one else could be on the same page as them.
What if they drafted a great quarterback that turned into the next Tom Brady?
That would be a nightmare for the league, and we would be stuck with more Patriot winning for the next two decades.
