What is your favorite movie from the 1980s?
I'd have to say one of the first two Back To The Future movies.
Do either of them stand out as your absolute favorite from that decade?
I would have to say Back To The Future 2.
That is a great movie. It is amazing that in some ways the were kind of accurate to what 2015 and later years would be like.
Yeah their prediction was definitely more futuristic then what actually happened.
Yet at the same time they accurately predicted our reliance on technology.
You are right. It was amazing how accurate they were with video conferencing and how big it would be.
Who do you think is the better actor in this movie: Michael Fox or Chris Lloyd?
They both did an excellent job in all three movies. This one in particular I think Fox did a great job.
I agree that he was great in this movie. He had to play himself at different ages and as different people and did an excellent job.
Lloyd was my favorite in this first movie but yeah Fox was great in this one.
None of them would have been great without both actors though.
I completely agree with that point.
Did you think Back To The Future 3 was necessary?
I do think it was necessary and kind of wished they also made a Back To The Future 4.
I disagree and think that the series could have even stopped at the end of the second movie if the ending was slightly modified.
The ending of the third movie was great though I was left wondering what happened next.
It was definitely a cliffhanger. As long as Marty ends up happy but that wasn't exactly assured to the fans.
Yes that is what I was hoping they would do but you see there is a chance he may still not be happy.
