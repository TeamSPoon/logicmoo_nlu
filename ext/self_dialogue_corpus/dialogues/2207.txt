Do you have a favorite NFL team?
Not really. I don't watch much football.
Fair. I tend to root for the patriots but that's because I'm from Boston.
My dad's from Boston too. He roots for the giants.
That's so wierd.
Yeah. he was super happy during their superbowl faceoffs.
I can imagine! Nothing says defeat like an 18-0 season ending in a superbowl loss.
For sure. although I guess the patriots got their redemption this past year.
Yeah that was amazing. I definitely thought it was over in the third quarter.
Me too.
I actually was more impressed with the game a few years back against the seahawks.
Oh yeah -- the one with that weird play at the end that won it?
Yeah. I forget what it was exactly, but it was just such a fortuitous mistake on the seahawks part.
It definitely was an odd decision.
Are you looking forward to anything specific this season?
Not really. I really just use games as a chance to hang out with friends on sundays over food and drink.
Hah, yeah. It's definitely part of the culture.
Do you want to watch a game with me sometime?
Sure!
Great!
