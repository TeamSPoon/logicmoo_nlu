I am excited for the superbowl this year.
I am too but do not rush it that fast.
Yeah I cannot wait to watch the season first.
Do you know the future sites where the superbowl will be held.
2018 will be held in Vikings football dome.
Yeah I knew that one.
2019 will be in the Atlanta Falcons dome.
I like that dome it is nice.
Yeah I think it is neat how the NFL does it in different places.
I do too.
2020 will be in Miami Dolphins dome.
I bet they are excited for that.
2021 will be in Los angelos but i am not sure what team that is.
Isn't that the raiders?
I thought but I think it is the rams.
Oh yeah it is the los angelos rams.
They have to make sure their building is suitable.
what do you mean.
their domes and stadiums have to meet certain expectations.
yeah that is understandble.
