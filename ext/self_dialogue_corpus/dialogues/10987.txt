Are you a Columbus Blue Jackets fan?
Yes I am a huge fan!
They have made so much progress since their inaugural season.
You are right! This year was a fantastic season for them.
Why do you say that? They are not even in the playoffs.
Well they had the longest active win streak out of any other team this season.
Ohh that is true! I heard they were only 1 win short of tying the Blackhawks all-time consecutive win streak.
Yeah what a bummer. Guess we will always be second to the penguins and blackhawks.
You mean the Washington Capitals? That is who broke our streak.
Really? Was it in Columbus or DC?
DC, thank goodness! That would have been devastating to snap the win streak in Columbus.
Oh well, maybe next season we will do better.
True, but for now we will have to watch the penguins win another stanley cup.
Yeah I guess. It seems like they go far in the playoffs every year.
They really do have a great team. I mean look at Sydney Crocby.
That is true. As much as I do not care for their team, they are very skilled.
Are there any other teams you like to watch?
Well the Predators have been fun to watch recently because historically they have not been a high achieving team.
That's true. I bet Nashville is buzzing with excitement.
You can say that again! I would love to see them as the underdog win a stanley cup.
