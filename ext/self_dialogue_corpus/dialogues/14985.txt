Do you like Ace Ventura?
Yes, Jim Carrey is great.
Did you see part 2?
Yeah, it is just as good as part 1.
Did you hate the beginning?
Yes, it was so sad when that raccoon fell.
I know. I cried when I saw that scene. The rest of the movie was funny though.
Remember when he fought that tiny tribal guy?
Yeah, that was hilarious.
And I will always remember that quote from part 1 "Do not... go in there!"
