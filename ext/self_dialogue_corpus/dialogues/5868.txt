I have heard people say the Gargoyle in Hunchback of Notre Dame is really Pumbaa from The Lion King .
People are mistaken. That statue actually exists.
Like in real life at the cathedral?
Exactly if you went to paris and saw it in person you would see it is a real life gargoyle.
But maybe that is what inspired  the looks of Pumbaa from The Lion King
Well what year was lion king out?
I think 1994 was when Lion king was released.
So that theory can't work because  hunchback was in 1996.
Unless the creators were already aware of the statue and maybe got inspiration for it prior to hunchback's release.
That could be. The cathedral was standing long before lion king.
