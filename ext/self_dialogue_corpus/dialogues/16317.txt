Did you ever listen to Inspectah Decks solo stuff?
No I have not, but I really like the Wu Tang Clan.
He did this one amazing album.
Which one is that?
Of course it is one of his first albums.
Why do you say of course.
Many rappers albums are the best when they are young and still hungry for money.
Wow I do see that a lot.
It is called Uncontrolled Substance.
Ok I will have to check that out.
Yes U-God from the Wu gets on there and lays down an amazing verse as well.
Is the whole album great?
Yes but really half the songs are true hits.
Ok I will listen to it.
Yes, I recommend you to pay attention to every lyric too, they are great.
I will definitely do that.
Yes the lyrics are so inspiriational and energizing.
Yes I can imagine, he was great on all the Wu Tang albums.
Yes, many of his solo songs are equally as good.
Ok thank you for the recommendation.
