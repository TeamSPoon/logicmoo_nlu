We watched a great movie the other night with Mel Gibson.
Mel Gibson was in it. I thought everyone in Hollywood hated him.
Well whatever his comments on things, he's a great actor.
True. What was the movie?
Blood Father.
I never heard of it.
It was great and in this one he actually died at the end.
That's a surprise.
Yeah. Sort of a happy ending, he saved his daughter.
Why, what happened?
She was involved with drug dealers and they were after her.
Was he a policeman?
No a convict.
So he went nuts on people then?
Yes, his usual  crazy character.
Was there a lot of shooting and fighting?
Sure was.
Who else was in it?
William H. Macy.
Do you mean from Shameless, really?
