Did you know preseason football starts in less than one month?
Yeah, I can't wait!
I'm excited for the Redskins, I think we're going to make the playoffs this year.
Well, I think they need to.
Why do you say that?
If they don't go to the playoffs, then Kirk Cousins will most likely walk, and then it's basically like they're starting over again.
Yeah, I guess you're right, but I think we have a good shot at making the playoffs this year.
Possibly, but I think in order to do that, it will be important to beat the other NFC East teams.
What do you think of our their new running back?
I like him. I think he will contribute right away and I think he has to.
Yeah, we lost two great receivers last year.
I think they tried to work on their defense though too, which is a good thing.
What do you think our record will be?
I think they will go anywhere from eight and eight to maybe ten and six.
Do you think nine wins and seven losses will get us in the playoffs?
I'm not entirely sure.
Well, let's hope for ten wins and six losses then!
As long as they stay healthy, it's not out of reach.
We should go to a game this year!
We should! Let me know what month you're thinking.
