What's your favorite Disney movie?
I really like Peter Pan.
Yeah, that's a great one. It's very funny. I especially like the interaction between Captain Hook and the Croc.
What's your favorite?
I would probably say The Jungle Book.
The original or the new one?
The original, although the new one was quite good.
Yeah, I thought the CGI looked really great in the new movie.
But it didn't have the same heart and soul as the old one.
I agree with that. The original movie had a special feeling that can't be recreated.
