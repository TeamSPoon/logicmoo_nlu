Did you ever hear of Daughn Gibson?
I don't think so.
He's kind of a weird country singer, songwriter, guitar-player.
Does he have any albums?
He did one of the greatest songs I've ever heard, called "Rain On A Highway".
That sounds kind of familiar. Was that the name of the album?
No, the song was on an album called, "All Hell." I heard it on Cartoon Network like 4am one morning.
Oh, wait a minute. That sounds familiar. Was it on a weird video?
Yes. It was some Claymation video showing cars getting washed away by a flood.
I think I saw that!
The video showed rain falling, and a flood, and toy cars washing away.
I saw that on some Cartoon Network show about short, weird animation videos.
It's a real primitive song, with lots of echo and some electrical hum, but I think it's great.
Is he on Soundcloud?
Not really. They only have really short excerpts of his music on Soundcloud.
I have to look that up.
His first name is spelled "D-A-U-G-H-N", not "D-O-N".
His album's selling for $100 on Amazon?! I've got to add that to my list.
He's got a couple of albums, but he's pretty obscure.
I've got to download that song.
