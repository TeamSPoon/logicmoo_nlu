Who wins the East this year?
Probably Pens.
I hate that. They are too good.
They do it with great roster managment.
Yeah I dont know how he fits all those guys under the cap.
Well they are top heavy but those lines are heavy enough to cause damage.
I never thought Kessel would win.
Hes going to stay where hes at.
Yeah I cant see him leaving Pitt.
Eventually he will but probably not by his own wishes.
But can Crosby stay healthy all series?
As long as hes not blocking shots he will be OK.
Thats not entirely true, guys like to target him.
Well they can but I think hes going to be smart about it.
Maybe they should limit his shifts until the third.
I dont agree, be proactive rather than reactive.
Fleury has been their MVP so far.
Yeah you almost feel bad for Matt Murray.
I dont, he won the Cup last year.
Yeah, he almost Wally Pipp'd Fleury out of Pitt
