What is your favorite Fast and Furious Movie?
I really like Furious 7. What do you think?
Yeah I really like that one too.
It was so amazing when they made the car fly! I almost believed they did for a second.
Yeah, I was surprised too. It was even funnier to see Paul Walker's character's expression.
I know, he looked so scared!
The only thing that I think needed more work was the dialogue. It just seemed kind of cheesy.
The dialogue is usually a little cliche, but I only watch for the action.
Oh yeah, the action is really good.
I'm excited to see what they do for the next one!
