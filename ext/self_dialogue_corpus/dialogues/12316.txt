Did you like the prequel trilogy?
No, and I don't know anyone who did.
They really messed up the plotlines in that movie.
I agree. Did we really need to see Darth Vader as a whining teenager?
And Padme's character was so flat and uninteresting.
She just seemed bored to me, like she didn't want to be there.
Palpatine was cool, though.
Yeah, he was the only one that seemed to enjoy what he was doing.
Why were the Jedi so foolish in that movie?
They were complacent, I guess, but they just came off as blind.
