What was your favorite Harry Potter Movie?
The Half Blood Prince.
I liked that one too.  Things had gotten more serious and the world is aware of you know who.
Plus it's the one where Snape Take out Dumpledore.
That was an amazing scene.  We also got to learn a bit about old Tom Riddle in that story.
I wish we could have learned more.  Sure he's as bad as bad gets but he has an interesting story I bet.
Yeah, most bad guys do.  Like how did they become so bad?
I'd like to know that.  I also loved the adventure of Dumpledore and Harry together.
Yeah, we almost never get to see Dumpledore throw down.  That cave scene was awesome.
It was one of my favorites throughout the whole movie.  It show Dumpledore actually struggle.
