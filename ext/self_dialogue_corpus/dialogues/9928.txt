What happened to Jadakiss?
I think he gave up on rap
His rhymes were tight.
He could literally touch no one when it came to freestyling.
I bet Eminem could do a better job.
I dont know I think Em listed him as an influence.
I just remember his song Low Down was so hot back in the day.
He had a couple underground albums that were hot as hell.
I wonder what made him give up the game.
Probably didnt want to die.
