What is your favorite movie, a funny one?
It has to be, Something About Mary.
Is that the one with Cameron Diaz?
Yes!!  I love her she is so funny.  She totally cracks me up!
Me too!  My favorite part is when she gets the 'hair gel' stuck in her hair.
That part was so funny!  I almost died when she answered the door with her hair sticking up.
And what about when Ben Stiller gets his "thing" stuck in his pants zipper?
I totally forgot about that part, so funny!
Oh I know he cracks me up, but  Cameron Diaz did the best job in this film.
I agree.  She makes this movie a must-see comedy classic.
