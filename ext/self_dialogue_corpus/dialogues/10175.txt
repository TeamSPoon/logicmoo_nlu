You know what movie I love? Django Unchained.
Dear God. I loved that movie, too.
A lot of people say it was slow, but I completely disagree. The dialogue was superb.
Exactly. That why I watch Tarantino films. The dialogue.
He is really a master. Like with Pulp Fiction when Samuel L. Jackson is in the house with those small time drug dealers.
"Mmhmm! This IS a tasty burger!"
I will never forget that so long as I live!
That scene is full of amazing dialogue.
How about, "I want you to go in that bag, and find my wallet." And the guy goes, "Which one is it?"
Oh, yes! And he says, "It's the one that says 'Bad Mother' beep!"
