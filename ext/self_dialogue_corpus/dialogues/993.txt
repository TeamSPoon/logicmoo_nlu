Hey, what do you think about football?
As in the NFL?
Yea, the NFL.
Well I love my Bills!
Me too!
I'm glad that they're changing things up
as in getting rid of Rex?
Yea
Did you think that he was the problem?
Definitely
Why's that?
Well he's in charge, right?
Kind of...
Well he's the guy making the final calls
But was it the calls that were bad?
It doesnt matter
What do you mean?
The buck starts and stops with him
True, but he's then just a scape goat
Could be..
