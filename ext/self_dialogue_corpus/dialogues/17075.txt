Stefani Germanotta is such a weird singer.
Wait, who?
Lady Gaga.
Whoa, her real name is Stefani?
Yeah, it's like three names long too. One of them's Joanne.
Really? I never would have guessed. I suppose that's why she shortened it.
But why to Lady Gaga, that's so weird!
I mean, you can complain all you want, but her music is fantastic.
I just find it weird that she was one of the first women to get four albums to number one.
Really? I'm not surprised. Her voice is amazing.
Honestly I never really knew she could sing until the Super Bowl.
Oh yeah, that girl's got pipes! Plus her songs are super catchy.
I think it was when she started singing Million Reasons that I was like, oh, you're not just all flash.
I super want to listen to Bad Romance now. It makes you want to dance!
That and Poker Face. Those were her first breakout songs, right?
Yep, along with Telephone.
But why does she have to be so weird? Like, meat dresses?
I don't know, but I don't think she does that as much any more.
Be weird to get fame, then be you, I guess.
Yeah. Now turn on Bad Romance! I want my 2009 dance groove on!
