Have you seen Reservoir Dogs?
Yes I have.
What did you think of the movie?
I thought it was really good.
Same here. I think it's Tarantino's best.
I would agree with you there.
What were some of the things you liked about the movie?
I liked that it was more on the dialogue between characters than the action scenes.
Yeah, it was a movie about a diamond heist and you never see the heist.
Exactly. You just see the aftermath.
What did you think of Mr. Blonde and the police officer?
I thought that scene was really good.
The music fit the scene very well.
Yeah. Really showed that Blonde was a loose cannon compared to the others.
What did you think of about Mr. Pink? Did you think he got away with the diamonds?
Yeah probably. It showed him getting in the car with the briefcase.
But the police were arriving at the scene shortly after he left.
True, but you never know with Tarantino's films.
Agreed. Lot of questions can be asked at the end of watching one of his films.
Which makes his films even better in my opinion.
