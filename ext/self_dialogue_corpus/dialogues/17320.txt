Who do you think was the best 60s band?
Easy, Beatles.
Don't you think they're a tad bit overrated?
No way, the British Invasion conquered all.
What about The Who?
They were okay, but Beatles were better
And The Rolling Stones?
yeah, also pretty good.
The Stones are still at it. An incredible feat for such an old group.
Probably a lot of drugs involved.
Yeah, probably.
I also liked Zeppelin
Weren't they more of a 70s band?
Yeah I guess so, but some of their early work was in the 60s.
Ah okay.
I guess the Beach Boys were pretty good.
Yes, they were great. Created a whole new genre of surfing music.
Is that really a genre? Who else plays that type of music?
Well Weezer kind of has a Beach Boys flavor to it.
yeah, I guess.
