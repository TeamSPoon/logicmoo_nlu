Will there be a race in the NFC South next year?
There might be.     Which teams do you like?
Well, I don't think they will compete, but even the Carolina Panthers have improved.
True, there defense was pretty good last season, even with Luke Kuechly out.
So next up is the New Orleans Saints?
They will improve, but I don't know how much better than 0.500 they can be.
Aren't they trying to sign Adrian Petersen?
That is the word on the street, but that probably is not enough.
The second place team last year was Tampa Bay.
Yes, they made the wildcard game.
Will they do the same this season?
They have improved and have a chance, but I do not see another playoff run.
OK.     That leaves the Atlanta Falcons.
Yes.    Team on the rise, and they might even make the Super Bowl against Houston or New England.
Wow!    That's quite a prediction.
They are that good.
Great, you think the NFC South will look a lot like last season.
Atlanta and Tampa at the top, yes.
What about at the bottom.
I think it could go either way with New Orleans and Carolina.
