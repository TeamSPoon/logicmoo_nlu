You may not have known this, but Luke Skywalker originally had a different name.
Let me guess: Dennis the Space Guy.
You're such a clever dude.  No, it was not that.
Well, what was it?
He was going to be called Luke Starkiller?
Starkiller?  I don't get why they thought that would be a good idea.
They originally thought the name sounded cool so that's why they went with.
Probably a good thing they changed his name.
Yep, right before production started, they changed it to something more appropriate for his character.
Luke Starkiller - I have to admit, does sound pretty cool!
