Have you heard of Reinxeed?
I don't remember, they are metal, right?
Yes.  They have songs like "Fantasia" and they're from Sweden, sort of melodic power metal.
Now that you mention it, I vaguely remember someone playing a song from them awhile back.  They're fast, right?
Yes, they're fast and melodic and their singer has an amazing range!
That I do remember.  The guitars were going real fast and his voice can go high or medium.
Maybe "Fantasia" was the song your friend played for you!
I remember it started fast with the guitars and then he screamed really high to get things going.
Yep, that's the one.  It's a great song that really sums up the best of what they do.
The thing is, when that friend played it for me, I wan't in the mood to listen to something fast like that.
Yeah, everyone gets like that, even me if you can believe!
Now that I find hard to believe.  Oh yeah, you do sleep sometimes right?
Yeah, hahaha.  Let's listen to the first 10-20 seconds and see if that's the song.
Yes, that's it, that's the one.  Those guys are so talented!
Did you ever hear their rendition of "Lay All Your Love On Me" by ABBA?
No, but I imagine it's awesome with his voice.  What's the singer's name?
Tommy Johansson, though he also goes by Tommy Reinxeed.
Well that's a good song for the road then.  We'll fire it up on the freeway while we're driving out to Lakeside later on.
Cool, I love listening to good music while driving!  Why don't I make sure it's on my MP3 player so you don't have to use data on your phone.
Good deal.  Put whatever you want on the MP3 player and save me some data!
