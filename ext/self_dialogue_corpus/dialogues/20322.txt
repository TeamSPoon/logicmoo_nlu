I saw the top two grossing anime movies in Japan for 2016 recently.
What were they called?
"A Silent Voice" and "Your Name".
Which one was better?
Both had me in tears, and both had incredible storylines and aesthetic qualities.
You have to pick one. Which did you see first and what was it about?
I'll pick "Your Name", which I saw first and it was about a boy and a girl who switch bodies and are trying to meet despite living in different times.
What was the other one about?
A reformed bully who seeks redemption for the suffering he caused a deaf girl in his class.
Wow... were these Miyazaki-level movies?
Absolutely, especially "Your Name".  It also had a great soundtrack by a band called The Radwimps.
What did the movies have in common?
Beautiful to look at and extremely emotionally nuanced with no black and white characters.
Do similar movies - particularly animated ones - exist in Hollywood?
Definitely not.
How do you feel about the storylines in Disney movies?
They are extremely linear, but they are beautiful movies. They have too many songs though.
I agree. I prefer how Japanese movies interlace music into the mood of the film without constantly making music the focus.
If you want mature animated films, watch both of these.
I'll have to wait until they are legal to stream!
