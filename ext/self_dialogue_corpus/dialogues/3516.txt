Have you seen that new Allison Williams horror movie?
I don't think so. What is it called?
It's called Get Out.
Oh ok. I've heard of it, but haven't seen it yet.
I really liked it. It was a nice departure from her role in Girls.
What is it about?
She brings her new boyfriend home to meet her family and he finds out that they have sinister plans for him.
That sounds interesting.
It is. It's really unexpected and unusual.
I'll have to check it out
