Do you still follow Peal Jam?
No. Are they still around?
I believe so. They are the only grunge band that survived.
I'm too old for music these days, but I will always have nostalgia for them.
I bought all of their tee shirts when I was young.
Me too! I had loads of posters and shirts.
I remember. You sold them on ebay.
Indeed. They appreciated in value so I made a nice profit.
I heard their song "Jeremy" a few days ago and thought of you.
Wow, that song never got old.
It sounded great. Took me back to 1992.
Ah, those were the days. NIrvana, Alice in Chains.
I could not turn off MTV because I wanted to see every video.
Ha ha, MTV was actually about music in 1992.
I tuned in to the Video Music Awards to see Red Hot Chili Peppers.
Did they ever play? I don't remember that.
Well, I thought they did.
I can clearly recall them winning an award.
Maybe that was it.
Red Hot Chili Peppers are still alive and well, too!
