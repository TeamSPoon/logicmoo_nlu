Have you ever seen Return of the Jeti?
Is that a Star Wars movie?
Yeah, it's one of the older ones.
When did it come out?
I'm not sure, before I was born.
I think I might have seen it.
Which ones have you seen then?
I saw the one where Luke fights DarthVader.
You mean when he gets his hand cut off?
Yeah, that's the one.
