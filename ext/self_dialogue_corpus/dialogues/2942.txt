NFL Season is upon us. Who do you think will win it all?
I hate to say it, but you gotta go with the Patriots right?
I know but I'm a little tired of them.
I understand that, but how can you bet against Tom Brady?
You really can't but hopefully some other teams give it a go.
Well I believe the Steelers still have a chance to take them down.
I was thinking Dallas had a chance this year.
They might have a chance but they are still a young team.
They are an exciting team, and have some talent.
I understand that, but I don't think Dak, and Zeek are ready for that next step.
If you don't think they can take it then who?
Only a handful of teams look good enough. Maybe Atlanta, Steelers like I said, Seattle, or Green Bay
I can't stand any of those teams. Hopefully there will be surprise this year.
There always seem to be a team or two who comes out of nowhere in the NFL
Yes, that is why I love the NFL, more than any of the other major sports.
Sports has been very dull without NFL over past few months.
It has been but only 2 months before we get NFL Countdown on ESPN.
Also only a month before we start drafting our fantasy teams.
Man all this talk is just getting me excited, I really can't wait...Just hate winter will follow with it.
Haha. That is the only downfall of the football season, is it does get cold.
