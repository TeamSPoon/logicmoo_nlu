Did you see the new Ghostbusters?
That one is all women, right?
Yeah it's totally female actors.
Talk about girl power!
Absolutely. Melissa McCarthy and Kristen Wiig are fabulous in this. Actually all the main actresses are.
I like that it's similar to the original Ghostbusters but more modern.
I know what you mean. I do miss that Slimer didn't play as big of a part.
I noticed that too.
But I do love that Chris Hemsworth is their male bimbo.
I that that was awesome too!
