Which Star Wars movie do you like the most?
For me, it's Empire Strikes Back, because when I was a kid the wait to see what happened next was so long and exciting!
You don't find that Empire seems outdated compared to today's movie standards?
Well, you can't compare older movies' effects to today's CGI stuff, which is why George Lucas went back and tried to digitally edit new CGI in.
That didn't go too well, since it made the new graphics in all of those original trilogy movies stick out like a sore thumb.
Sure, but you'll note that Empire Strikes Back had the least amount of new scenes added for the Special Edition.
That probably means Empire Strikes Back was probably good enough to stand the test of time.
Exactly what I was saying, and that's one of the main reason why I think Empire Strikes Back is my favorite!
Well, I thought Jar Jar was funny in the Phantom Menace.
"I don't know where you get your delusions, laser brain" - That's a line from Empire Strikes back and fitting to what you just told me.
