ac/dc is the best rock group ever.
they are good but they are nothing compared to grateful dead
AC/DC had the best to vocals of all time
yes but grateful dead are game changers
they are not game changer they are just old
old my ass the still jam hardcore whats your problem?
AC/DC is my problem. go and listen to the Iron Man two sound track
i cant beliave you would compaie the two
yeah they both are great
yeah, but Queen is better then both.
