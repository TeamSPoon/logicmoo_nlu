My daughter bought me a mix of song by Frank Sinatra for my birthday.
Oh, that is nice he is one of my favorite crooners from the old days.
Mine too. His music makes me feel so relaxed.
I know I feel the same way. Fly Me To The Moon is such a gentle relaxing song.
Yes, but he has some exciting ones too like My Way, that song makes me feel empowered.
My father was always singing I Got You Under My Spell to my mother.
That's pretty romantic he must have loved her  a lot.
He did and she loved him. She said, it was playing on the juke box when she first laid eyes on him.
My parents, played his music all the time, I remember them playing Strangers In The Night and it had a scratch on it.
Records, brings back memories.
I used to love to look over every inch on the record cover and imagine what the singers life was like.
Did your parents listen to Dean Martin or Sammy Davis Jr.
Oh yeah, they also like Bing Crosby, but Frank was their favorite of all the crooners.
I remember watching them on the television in black and white. They seemed to have so much fun together.
Well, they were all really friends in real life and a part of the rat pack.
I heard they first called it the Summit or the Clan, the rat pack was a name the news media used for them.
You don't see a group of celebrities that were friends like that anymore.
I think one of the best parts of being an actor or singer is your work lives on forever.
That's true, they will always be a part of history.
Well, with youtube anyone can leave a mark these days, although not to that extent.
