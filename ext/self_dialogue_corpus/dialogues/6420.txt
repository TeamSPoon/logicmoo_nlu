Do you want to watch the Disney movie Moana with me?
Is that the movie with Dwayne Johnson in it?
Yes! The Rock voiced the character Maui in the movie.
Oh, I am a fan of Dwayne Johnson, the show sounds interesting.
You will love the movie, the show also features songs written by Lin-Manuel Miranda.
Lin-Manuel Miranda? The guy who wrote the musical "Hamilton"?
Yes! I love the song "You're Welcome" in the movie written by Lin-Manuel Miranda. Maui's part was sang by Dwayne Johnson.
Well, now, I would really love to watch the movie now.
Great! I have the dvd at home. Drop by later in the afternoon.
Alright, I'll bring the popcorn.
