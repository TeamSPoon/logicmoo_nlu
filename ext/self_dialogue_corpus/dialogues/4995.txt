Do you watch Major League Baseball?
A little, but I don't follow it religiously.
Yeah, me too. I have a team that I support, but I don't really watch very often.
What team do you root for?
I'm an Atlanta Braves fan.
Oh really? I'm a Nationals fan.
They're in the same division I'm pretty sure. I actually think Washington and Atlanta are about the same amount of distance from where I live.
Oh cool, how did you become a Braves fan?
My dad was a Braves fan. There weren't really any other teams in the south east until the 90s I think, so there are a lot of Braves fans around here.
That makes sense. I like the Nationals because I live very near Washington DC and they've been a good team recently.
Cool, did you ever play organized baseball?
Yeah, I played through senior year of high school.
Oh really? Me too, I played through senior year as well.
You know, I like playing baseball and going to the ballpark to watch games, but it's really boring to watch on TV.
I agree. I played it and it's fun to go to the ballpark to watch in person, but watching it on TV can be pretty dull.
It's also hard to keep up with your team consistently because the season is so long.
Yeah, the season is 162 games long I think. That's a lot of games to devote time to.
True, but I doubt they'll shorten it.
Yeah, I don't think they'll shorten the season either. That would mean less revenue.
And I hope they don't lengthen it either. It really doesn't need to be any longer than it already is.
