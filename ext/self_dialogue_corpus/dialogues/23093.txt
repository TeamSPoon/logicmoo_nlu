Do you think the Joker should have his own film?
He is the greatest villain ever!
But who would you want to play him?
Thats a tough one to be honest with you
Yeah I would want Heath Ledger
Obviously that is not based in reality.
Yeah so would you say Jared Leto.
I guess so since we barely got to see him in Suicide Squad.
Do you think Jack Nicholson would reprise his role?
At this point of his life? Not a chance.
Or maybe they could go a whole different route.
I think DC Wants to keep it consistent to be honest with you.
Hell yes I think thats what they want to do.
So do you think he would fight Batman in it?
I dont know if he would need to fight anyone
So what would the film be centered on?
How he got to be the way he did.
There are multiple instances of that.
What do you mean?
DC created 3 different ways he became the Joker
