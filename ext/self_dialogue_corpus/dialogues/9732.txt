Who is the best hip hop artist in 2017?
I have to say Drake, he has been on top for the last 5 years.
Don't you think his music is more pop than hip hop?
I would consider it more commercial but he isn't pop like Justin Beiber.
Fair enough. Do you think he is better now that Lil Wayne isn't a part of the Young Money record label?
As much as I like Lil Wayne, I think Drake has grown more as an artist without any other influnce.
I saw the two of them live last time they toured and I thought Lil Wayne was actually better in person.
Back when he was making hits during Carter II and Carter III, Lil Wayne was the best.
Have you heard anything recently that you like from Lil Wayne?
It's been a few years, but he did a collaboration with Currency that was great.
