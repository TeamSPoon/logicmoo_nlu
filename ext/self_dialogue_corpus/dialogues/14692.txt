I like Minnesota.
Why?
They've got crazy plays.
Like, what?
They always lose the plot.
In a good way?
In a good way.
What about them exactly?
Offense, yeah?
I'm not really sure about that.
They always play run-ups.
Yeah, but that's old playbook.
It's fun.
It's basketball from the 80s.
I like seeing it.
It's so boring.
I love the dunks.
I don't like the dunks.
I lose my stuff when there's a dunk.
It's bad.
