You're stranded on a desert island and can only have one Disney movie to watch forever. What is it?
The Incredibles.
Why The Incredibles? What about the others?
I like the classics too, but The Incredibles are my favorite.
What makes The Incredibles worthy of being the only Disney movie you'll ever watch again?
Like I said I like the other movies too, but I like the story of The Incredibles the best.
I'll be honest, I don't remember much about that movie.
It's the movie about the family with superpowers.
Oh right. That's the movie about the retired heroes that take down the giant robot.
Yeah, that's the one. It has more action than the others so that's why I like it the most.
