What film do you wish you could have starred in?
Good question, so many, but maybe funny face.
Why do you pick that old one?
well filmed in paris and such beautiful outfits and you get to sing and dance with fred astaire.
Good reasons as any I suppose.
I heard the director was worried about a mob scene when fred is on the champ de elyses. They had him come in a taxi and look for his mark.
Interesting I wonder if they did anything special to guard audrey from fans.
I don't know, I just had seen that tidbit on turner classic movies.
Oh I see. I love hitchcock so often watch it on that channel.
Which movie would you want to be in?
I think Star wars. It seems like it would have been so cool being on that set.
That is a good one. Or something like space odyssey would have been fun.
Totally or any space movie really.
I think gravity was really good did you see it?
I loved george clooney in that one!
I liked him but felt sandra really stole the show!
Well her role was bigger overall. She was good too.
She is good usually.
True. I love even her in practical magic.
How good is she in miss congeniality? That maybe favorite bullock comedy flick.
