Have you ever heard of Lindsey Stirling?
Maybe, or at least the name sounds familiar.
She's a dancing violinist that got her start on YouTube.
Oh yeah! Wasn't she on the X Factor or something?
Lindsey was on America's Got Talent, yeah.
Cool, so that wasn't what rocketed her to fame?
No, actually, she got voted out and the judge told her she wasn't good enough to fill a stage.
Ouch, that had to hurt.
Yep, but it sure motivated her--she's gone on to make several albums and toured around the world.
Wow! But what's that got to do with YouTube?
She started posting videos on YouTube in 2007, but it wasn't until 2012 that she finally had a hit.
That's a long time to wait.
You know what they say--fame takes time, then it hits in an instant.
So is she still doing music now, or?
Yeah, she just finished her tour "Brave Enough" this year.
I bet she has the best life ever now.
Actually, she released a documentary this week and it talked about all the struggles she's been facing.
Struggles? What do you struggle with when you're that famous?
Well, she struggled with anorexia in college, her best friend tied on tour from cancer, and then her dad died a few weeks after her last performance on the Brave Enough tour.
Wow. She's really been through a lot, I guess.
