DId you watch Disney's last Herbie movie?
The one with Lindsay Lohan?
Yeah, Herbie Fully Loaded. I watched it recently for the first time and although it wasn't a really good movie overall, I had a lot of fun watching it.
It did a decent job of paying homage to the original Herbie movies. I think some of the modern takes didn't really sit well with modern audiences that wanted more nostalgia from Disney for Herbie.
I thought the special effects they did for Herbie was really cool. I don't know what long time Herbie fans expected.
I can't speak for them but I remember wanting less of the teen drama and more Herbie!
More racing scenes would have been great, but I think they provided enough and the ones they did provide, were excellent!
Did you like Herbie's love interest? That other bug, the modern one.
I thought it was a little corny, but I didn't really mind it. I liked Lindsay in there too.
She did a good job, Michael Keaton was her father remember? Overall it was fun but not one of those legendary memorial Disney films.
