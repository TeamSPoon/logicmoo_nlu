Have you ever watched Disney's Sleeping Beauty?
Yes. It is actually one of my favorite Disney movies.
Prince Phillip is my favorite Prince out of any Disney Princess movie.
I love the part where he is singing to Aurora in the woods. What's that song again?
That song is Once Upon a Dream.
That's right and she is dancing with the owl and the cape before she realizes he is there.
He really is a great Prince, you know he's one of the few that actually plays an active role in the movie.
That's why I like him, he battles a dragon to save her that's pretty heroic.
I wonder if they plan on doing a live action movie.
They did Maleficent, but I don't know if they are actually going to do Sleeping Beauty.
