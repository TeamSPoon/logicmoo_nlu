I just watched the movie Sully, did you see it?
No, I wanted to. Is it good?
Yea, very good.
Tom Hanks is in that right?
Yea, he is the pilot.
Was it interesting?
Yea, but even if the story was boring Tom Hanks seems to make every movie he's in good.
Yea, I like him.
He really brings life to his character. Sort of like he becomes them.
I guess it wasn't too long?
Only about an hour and a half.
I guess you couldn't drag a movie out about a plane taking off and having to land right away.
Could you imagine having to land in a river.
I guess he did some quick thinking.
Did it look real in the movie when the plane went down.
Yea, the special effects were pretty neat.
You should see if it's on a pay per view channel.
Maybe I will, or Home Box.
I will have to look, my husband didn't see it yet.
Well Tom Hanks as a pilot, its got to be good.
