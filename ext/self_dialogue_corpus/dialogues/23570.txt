So who is your favorite actor?
It is tom cruise!
He would have been my favorite actor if he was not a real egoistic person in real life.
I know. But I still love his movies, and since he is an actor, that is all that matters to me.
So which was the last tom cruise movie you saw in theaters?
I forgot the name of last mission impossible movie, but that is the move I saw in theaters.
There has been too many mission impossible movies, even I don't remember the name of last MI movie.
Was it ghost protocol?
I think the ghost protocol was mission impossible 4.
Oh, So there was another mission impossible movie after that.
Yes, let me recall, was it rogue nation?
Yes! it was rouge nation!
But aren't there 6 mission impossible movies so far?
wait was there a sixth mission impossible? are you sure?
No, I am not sure, I think there was sixth part but I am not very confident.
I have to look that on google today only.
So are you die hard mission impossible fan?
Oh yes! It is one of the best action movie series I have ever seen.
Yes, as a series, it seems the best, But there are better solo action movies out there.
That may be, but I don't think any other action movie series can defeat Mission impossible.
