I think my favorite Film Noir is Laura.
I think Laura is great as well.  Dana Andrews does a great job as the detective.
Clifton Webb is really fantastic in his first major role.
First? He's like fifty.
He was big on the stage.
Have you seen the Phantom Lady?
No. Who's in it?
Well, Francot Tone, Craig Stevens, and a woman whose name I don't remember.
Gee, sounds thrilling.
Actually it's really good.  You find out who the killer is part way through but it makes it really good.
I'll check it out. What do you think of I Wake Up Screaming?
I think you need some for help for that.
Ha ha.  No really.
I do like it.  I like the use of Street Scene and Over the Rainbow in the movie.
I think it's Betty Grable's best acting role.
And it's the only film where I don't have Victor Mature.
Yeah, he's not exactly brillant.
I just saw Out of the Past.
Oh, I haven't seen it yet. Don't tell me about it.
Okay, hit me back when you watch it.
