Turn that blasted music off!
What?
I said turn that blasted music off!
Awwww. Why Dad?
Because it's crap. That's why!
Crap? Do you even know who this band is Dad?
Nope. And I don't care to know either.
This is Boyz II Men, and this is one of their chart-toppers!
Peter Frampton had several chart-toppers, too.
Who is he?
Exactly my point.
What are you saying?
20 years from now, nobody will remember these Boys in the Mens Room
Boyz II Men Dad! Not Boys in the Mens Room. And you're wrong about that.
You just wait and see.
No way. This is one of the greatest bands ever!
That's what my brother said about The Buggles, but video killed that radio star...
Did something happen on XM Radio?
XM Radio?  It will never last...
Dad, not everybody can be Elvis...
