Did you get to listen to Selena's album Revival yet?
I haven't, is it any good?
Revival was a huge success. It was released in October of 2015.
What kind of music is on this album?
It is mostly dance pop music from Selena.
What was the label?
Interscope Records and Polydor Record was the label she produced under.
Sounds great. What songs were on that album?
She released fourteen songs on that album.  One of them was Hands to Myself, one of my favorites.
Really, that sounds like an awesome album.
The cover of the album was more adventurous than she normally did in the past as well.
What do you mean?
Well, she looks almost naked in it.
I see, hopefully not!
Right! But the songs are great. Do you know Body Heat and Rise?
I do, those are some of my favorites from the radio.
Yeah they were on that album.
I may have to check her album out and buy it.
You should, its fantastic.
Thanks!  Will do!
