So I saw the new Fast and Furious.
Oh, there's a new one?
Yeah.
I guess there's always a new one.
Yeah, they're kind of starting over now because --
Wasn't there one set in Japan, that was all about drifting?
Yeah, Tokyo Drift.
I saw the previews for that. It reminded me of Tokyo Xtreme Racer.
That's... what?
Oh, right. You didn't own a Dreamcast, did you.
