Are you ready for football season?
I have been ready a long time for football season actually!
I know what you mean, life is very bring without the NFL!
Have you had the chance to go to any Carolina Panthers games the last couple of seasons?
I have went to a couple, but not as many as I would like.
Me either! I am wanting to go a few times this upcoming season though.
That should be fun, what kind of team do you think we will have this year?
It is hard to tell judging on the past two seasons.
I know, the year before last was awesome. However, last year was a major let down.
It sure was!  I am still scratching me head about last season.
Me and you both. Hopefully Ron Rivera will figure things out though.
I am kind of concerned about Cam Newton myself.
Yea, he did not quite seem like himself last year for whatever reason.
Hopefully he will go back to playing like he was when he took us to the Superbowl!
I think he will, I am more concerned with how the defense performed last year.
The front office made some great moves in re-loading our front line this off season. So I am hoping that works.
Me to, I am glad we were able to resign Mario Addison as well.
Yea that was very big! He is a nice asset to our defense in my opinion.
Plus we still have Luke Kuechly, and that is the most important thing!
Yea, I think he is one of the best linebackers in the entire league.
