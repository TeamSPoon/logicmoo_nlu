Did you watch the Superbowl last night?
Yeah, that was an insane game.
I can't believe the Patriots came back from from that deficit.
I know! Tom Brady really had to carry his team to victory in the second half.
At the same time though you have to feel for the Falcons.
Yeah that must have been rough to lose that.
How do you throw away a 21-3 lead though?
I know right. All you have to do is play a really conservative defense and you should be fine.
I actually stopped watching at half time because I though it was over. But then my brother called me back in after the 3rd quarter.
Well it's a good thing you dint miss the fourth quarter!
I know! It was crazy to watch the Patriot score 19 points in the last quarter.
I guess Brady just really wanted it.
Yeah. I'm not a huge fan of Brady, but credit where credit it due. That guy is insane.
He completely took over that game that last quarter.
Not just the last quarter! The entire second half!
He was playing really well in overtime too.
Yeah he really just outclassed Matt Ryan.
I think outclasses everyone in the NFL at the moment.
Lets hope the next Superbowl is as good as this one.
I wish every game was as good as this Superbowl.
