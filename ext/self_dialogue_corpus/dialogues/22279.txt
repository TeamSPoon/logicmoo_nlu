People hate on Adam Sandler all of the time but I still like him.
Really, his movies haven't been good in awhile.
Yeah but have they ever been?
Are you saying we have nostalgia goggles for him?
Possibly, his movies have always been pretty stupid comedies.
Yeah but they hold up compared to his newer stuff, I still laugh at his old stuff.
When is the last time you watched Billy Madison?
I don't know, years ago?
Give it another watch and you'll see it's in a similar style to his newer stuff.
Do I actually want to do this and ruin my memories?
Or will it improve your perception of his newer stuff?
I am not sure that's possible.
Anything's possible, just as I've watched Big Daddy at least 50 times.
Is that really your most watched movie by him?
Yup, just something about it that's so rewatchable and heartwarming.
That is true, it's one of his better stories, really likeable.
I feel like it doesn't get enough credit sometimes as being a legitimately good movie.
None of his movies do sometimes.
Oh now you're starting to sound like me.
I take back what I said.
