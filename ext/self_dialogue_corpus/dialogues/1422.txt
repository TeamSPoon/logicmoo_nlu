Are you a fan of the New England Patriots?
No. I hate that team?
But why? They are such an amazing team. Name one team in recent memory that has been as dominant as they've been.
I don't care if they win a lot, I still don't like them.
Is it because you don't like Brady?
Not just Brady. Belichick and the whole organization are just a bunch of dirty cheats.
Oh, you're still on about that Deflate Gate scandal aren't you?
Yes, that whole team is full of cheats and they all need to be banned from the NFL.
You do realize they actually won another Super Bowl after that whole scandal blew over.
So? What's that have to do with anything.
It means that despite what people would like to say, a few under-inflated balls was not the reason the Patriots were so good.
But it was still an unfair advantage!
That's the other thing, if a ball was under-inflated during a game, wouldn't both sides get the same advantage since they play with the same ball?
Yes, that's technically true.
So then how does one side get a huge unfair advantage if they are both throwing the same ball?
Okay, so even if they didn't get some huge advantage or cheat, I still don't like them!
Now you are just being stubborn.
No, I just refuse to jump on the Patriots bandwagon along with everyone else.
What bandwagon? I've been a Patriots fan since they were getting trounce back in the 90s.
Well maybe you're a true fan, but most people are just jumping on the bandwagon.
