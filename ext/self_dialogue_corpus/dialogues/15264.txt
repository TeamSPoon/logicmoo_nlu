I've been obsessed with Spanish music recently.
Like who? I don't listen to a lot of Spanish music.
I like J Quiles, Don Omar, and Maluma.

It's like pop. You probably won't understand what they're saying but you'll like the music.
Really? Who's your favorite one right now?
I love maluma. He has some great songs.

Try Sin contrato and el perdedor first.
Okay, ill listen to those.
I'm telling you you'll like them. Plus he's so cute.

It's good for working out?
Yes it's really upbeat and catchy.
