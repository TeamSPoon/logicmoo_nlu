What is your favorite Indiana Jones movie?
Probably Raiders of the Lost Ark.
What makes it your favorite?
Probably the whole classic snake pit and Indy's struggling to deal with it.
Yeah, it makes you feel for the guy! I like The Last Crusade.
It's a classic - and the whole "choose wisely" scene - I love it.
I know! Every time I watch that whole part I'm tense, even though I know how it will turn out.
Do you know where they shot those scenes?
I'm afraid I don't know.
That's a bummer. But it's beautiful, no matter where it is!
