Did you watch the Red Sox - Yankees game last night?
Of course, I would never miss a rivalry game.
Did you watch the game until it was finished?
Yes, I watched the whole ballgame, even though it went into extra innings.
That looked like strike three to me.
I disagree, that pitch was outside.
How many homeruns do you think he'll hit this year?
Hopefully more than last year.
Why didn't the runner tag up on that fly ball?
I guess he didn't think it was hit deep enough.
Do you follow your favorite team's entire organization or only the major league club?
I only have time to keep track of the major league team?
What is your favorite MLB team?
My favorite team is the Chicago Cubs.
Do you think they retaliate for hitting that batter with the pitch?
Probably not, it didn't look intentional.
The shouldn't have walked that batter, he's really fast.
I agree.  He's probably going to steal second base.
Do you like the Designated Hitter rule?
No, I'm a fan of how the National League makes pitchers bat.
