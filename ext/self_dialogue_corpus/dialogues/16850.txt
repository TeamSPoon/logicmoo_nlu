What do you think of Skrillex?
That is one big question, I don't know where to start.
Do you like his music?
I did but it's not good to listen to when you want some quiet.
That's true.
I usually listen to music when i'm working or just trying to relax but I do like his music.
Did you know he came from nothing?
No I didn't, was he just an average person?
No he was on the poorer side and his first album was made with a blown out speaker.
That's impressive.
Have you heard of bangarang?
Yes that's one of his songs right?
Yes, also my favorite.
I need to catch up on his music.
Should come over this weekend we can game and listen to some Skrillex songs while we do it.
That sounds like fun.
What do you think of his beats and pace of his songs?
That's what makes him Skrillex nothing is quite comparable he brings the beats better than anyone else.
I can feel those songs in my chest it's a little scary.
It gets your blood flowing.
