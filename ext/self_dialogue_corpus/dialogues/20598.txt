What is your favorite movie genre?
This might be a little strange but it love Christmas movies.
Really?  Why do you prefer them?
I like the feel good quality to a good Christmas movie.
Which movie is your favorite?
I love the first Santa Clause Movie with Tim Allen as the Santa Clause.
Oh yes!  He was excellent in that one.
I loved how he shaved off his full beard and looked in the mirror and it grew back immediately
That was excellent.  He couldn't control his eating and it was so funny.
Do you have a favorite scene in that movie?
I enjoyed the scene when Judy the elf thought Santa was hitting on her.
I laugh every time I see that one.
Every year I watch that movie probably two or three times.
I usually watch it at least once as well.
I really like how the movie brought Charlie back to wanting to be with his Dad.
It really did have a sweet story line didn't it?
I know that it is June but maybe I should watch it tonight.
Hey that is a good idea.
Do you want to watch it together?
Yep.  Come on over and I will get the popcorn ready!
