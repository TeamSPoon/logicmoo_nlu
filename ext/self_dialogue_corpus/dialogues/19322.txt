Paul McCartney of the Beatles wrote a lot of great hits.
Yes, I am pretty sure him and John Lennon wrote almost all of the Beatle Music.
Remember McCartney had the band Wings.
Yes. Does he still play with them?
I am not sure. I know he has toured on his own in the past few years.
What songs did he write?
Oh, so many. Helen Wheels was one of my favorites when he played with Wings.
What others?
The list goes on, Hey Jude, Back in the USSR , Blackbird, I'll Follow the sun were some.
He really writes good lyrics.
Yes, he wrote hundreds of songs.
Did you know he just turned 70?
Wow, I can't beleive it.
And still out there rocking today!
I know, many of the bands from back there are still into music.
If you find something you love to do, keep on doing it.
For sure and music keeps you going.
It really does.
And listening to greats like McCartney adds pleasure to your life.
Yes definitely.
