Did you see any of the old Disney films in theaters?
I only remember seeing The Lion King and Aladdin
Those were both 90's right?
Yes
I liked them too. But, I did not see them in theaters
It would be cool to see the older ones in theaters
Like 101 Dalmatians?
Yes
I love that movie
Me too. I bet on the big screen it is even better
