Do you remember the Walt Disney movie called Bambi?
Yes, vaguely though. What was it about again?
It was about a young deer growing up in the forest. His name was Bambi.
Oh yes, I think I remember now. Didn't his mother die at the end of the movie?
Yes, I believe that's what happened in the movie. I do remember the young rabbit Thumper.
Thumper was a interesting character. Wasn't he Bambi's best friend or something?
I do believe they were best friends in the movie. They were pretty much in all the scenes.
Yes. Those types of movies would teach so much to young children right now.
Tell me about it. I remembered when Bambi first learned to speak. It was so sweet seeing him try to say birds..."B-burr".
Thumper was such a good friend to him, teaching him how to speak.
