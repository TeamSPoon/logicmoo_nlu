Have you seen any good movies lately?
Not really, but I have been looking for a good historical movie to watch.
What kind of movies do you like?
Well, as far as historicaly movies go, nothing beats We Were Soldiers.
That is a good one. Have you seen the World War II period movies like Saving Private Ryan?
Yes, I have. What other suggestions do you have?
Well there are a couple of newer ones. Have you seen Fury with Brad Pitt?
No, I have not. Are there any more recent historical films you can suggest?
How recent do you mean? There are a plethora of more modern films.
Perhaps something that is not widely known about, like World War II.
Well, I can reccomend Hotel Rwanda. It is about the genocide that took place over there.
I have heard that is a good movie so I will have to try it.
Warning though, it is very emotional and a little gruesome.
I think I can handle it. Have you seen any good movies?
I haven't been able to find a movie I have really loved since Pitch Perfect 2 came out.
Did you hear that they are making another one?
Really, when is that going to come out?
I think the movie is set to be released around Christmas this year.
I hope it is not a flop. I am not sure where they can go with the plot from where they left off.
I guess you will just have to wait until it comes out in December.
