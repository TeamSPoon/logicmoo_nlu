Do you like the band Queens of the Stone Age?
I do! I love their song No One Knows.
Dave Grohl did the drumming for that band didn't he?
Yes and he was excellent in that song. The drums really stood out.
Wasn't he with Nirvana for a little while also.
Yes and he was the front man for The Foo Fighters.
Oh I love them! They have a new video out that features them rocking out in a nursing home.
I've seen it. It's hilarious and it really fits their playful style.
I agree with that. Dave Grohl is one of the remaining legends of our time.
I'm going to go listen to some Queens of the Stone age right now!
