Did you make that purse?
I did. It's made from a T shirt I cut and sewed.
It's so cute.
I sell them at flea markets sometimes.
I want to learn to do that.
I will show you. You can use any shirt.
I have a few old ones that are frayed.
That's fine. It's a good way to reuse as well so you don't waste things.
Could I use this plaid shirt?
Yes.
I love this but it's messed up so I'd like to make a bag out of it.
We can do that right now if you have the thread and stuff.
I have that right here.
OK, well let's get started.
Do those bags sell well?
It depends. Some people really like them.
I've never seen one like it before.
I got the idea online.
I just want the plaid one for myself.
Let's start on it now.
