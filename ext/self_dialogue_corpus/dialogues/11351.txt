Do you like that song I am the Walrus by the Beatles.
Yeah it is a great song.
It has some weird lyrics.
I agree, they really don't make any sense.
I've heard it was a commentary for people looking into their songs to much for hidden meanings.
I just like the song, I don't analyze the lyrics.
Same here but that song has a few weird lines.
Yeah it does, maybe that is why I like it.
Yeah me to, I am the Walrus.
I am the egg man.
