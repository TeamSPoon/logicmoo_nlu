I want to find a good movie to watch!
I have a lot of movies, what are you in the mood for?
Something suspenseful! I love a good thriller.
Have you ever seen Eye For An Eye?
Not sure, who is in it?
Sally Field plays a woman looking for revenge after her daughter is murdered.
That sounds really good actually.
It is, Sally Field is very talented.
Yea I love all of her movies basically.
I will bring it on over and we will watch it!
