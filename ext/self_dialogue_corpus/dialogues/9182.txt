So sad about the death of Chris Cornell. Really loved Soundgarden.
Me too! I loved the "Big Seattle Four" rock bands from that era.
Those bands really changed our generation, and changed rock music.
Pearl Jam, Nirvana, Alice in Chains and Soundgarden. What a group.
So talented. What's your favorite rock song?
Probably Black Hole Sun by Soundgarden. You?
Black by Pearl Jam.
Can't go wrong with Eddie Vedder.
He's the only frontman from the Big Four still alive!
Yes let's wrap him in bubble wrap.
