So do you think the Patriots can repeat this year?
No way! Tom Brady is getting too old, he's going to break down eventually.
They say that every year and it never happens, now he's got more weapons
But what Aaron Rodgers and the Packers? Talk about weapons
Brady now has Brandin Cooks, that's going to a really hard combo to stop.
Fine, my dark horse though are the Ravens
Really?? Joe Flacco? No way
They've got Jeremy Maclin now, finally a good reciever for him to throw to, plus a bunch of other targets
Nah, bet the Ravens go 8-8, miss the playoffs
But that Baltimore defense is intense. Although they have to get by the Steelers twice
Yeah Antonio Brown is dangerous. Who do you have for the worst team?
Cleveland Browns, like every year
I was thinking the same thing. Whose the team that comes out of nowhere to almost win it all?
The Oakland Raiders
Yeah! Derek Carr and that huge contract? Why not
Yeah finally a good team from California
I mean Los Angeles now has the Rams and Chargers
Yeah but neither of them will do anything, plus the 49ers are terrible
Yes San Francisco is the second worst team in the NFL
They should resign Colin Kapernick
