Did you see the movie baywatch?
That just came out?
Yeah.
No not yet unfortunately.
Oh it was good!
Really? I heard it was not good.
Well it is kind of cheesy, but the rock is funny in it.
Isn't zac efron in it too?
Yes he is.
Was he a good actor?
He was alright.
I may wait until it comes out on cable.
Yeah it is probably more worth it to do that.
I saw Get Out recently.
Was that good?
It was very good but scary.
I don't like horror films.
That is too bad.
Well anyways I enjoyed talking to you.
Same!
