What was the song that made the beatles famous?
The first big song they had was love me do.
I don't think I even know that one.
Really? It is a bit more do-op like to me. cute lyrics very popular with the girls of course.
So that is what worked for the females in the 1960's. Seems so different from today.
The lyrics are much different. Today songs are much more obscene that first song love me do was very innocent and sweet.
I wonder who the sweetest beatle was?
I bet Paul with those baby blues hard not to see him as the sweetie.
Was he the youngest?
Not sure I know George Harrison was the oldest then John Lennon. So either paul or ringo.
