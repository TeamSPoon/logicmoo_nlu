What did you think of Tokyo Drift.
For some reason that movie sticks out in my head the most of the franchise.
In a good or bad way?
Bad, it was really cheesy and had none of the main characters.
Yea, neither Paul nor Vin were in it as main characters.
Also the music and cars were silly.
Yea, they really went crazy with the cars.
Maybe they thought since they were in Japan they needed to up the strange factor.
Yea, most seemed like toys that would never be driving on a road.
Yea, that black and orange one in particular.
