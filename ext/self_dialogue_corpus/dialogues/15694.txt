Do you know any cool electronica bands?
Why, are you looking to get into that genre more?
Yeah, but I just don't know where to start!
You can start off with Ratatat
I think I've heard of them, there is a song with a tiger roar
That was probably wildcat, that's a great song!
Besides Ratatat, what are some other good bands?
I like Odesza, they are not as famous as Ratatat though
What is a good song by them?
I like Bloom and Say my name
Okay, I will give those a listen later today
How long have you liked techno music?
Since I was born pretty much!
And what do you like most about it?
I like that the words are not always important
What do you mean by that?
Anyone can enjoy the music, because the words are not essential to feeling the beat
Oh that's cool. It makes me feel like I should find music from other cultures and see what I feel
You can check out Tiesto later, he is European and has very energetic music!
Oh, I already know of Tiesto, but I will find his stuff on Spotify later too!
