How about them carolina panthers ?
Can't wait for the season to get underway !!!
I hope cam newton will be able to do a little bit more than he did last season.
Exactly.....I don't know what got into him last season....maybe he did one too many dabs.
Do you think Tom Brady will retire after this season.
Highly doubt it...he just won the superbowl....he's a freak !
I think Kelvin Benjamin is gonna go off this year
He better,  if not it might be the end of the line,  he has the talent....he just hasn't proved it all the way yet !
Did you ever watch the 85 Bears ?
Sure did,  I was 7 but I remember watching Refrigerator Perry run a yard for a TD !
The panthers have a pretty great,  not just good offensive line this season.
I agree,  Kahil, Oher, and Trai Turner have unlimited talent on the O-Line !
Thomas Davis is a pure beast....you think he'll go off this year ?
More than likely.....I knew since day one he was special.
Have you heard that Jericcho Cotchery is the new WR coach for Carolina ?
WhAAAATTTT ???? Had no idea....he'll be a good one !!!
Coach Rivera has really, truly proven that he's one of the best in the league.
ESPN...has put him in their top 5 head coaches in the league !
Do you think any team will sign Colin Kaepernick before the season starts ?
I highly doubt it....I know I wouldn't....all he is a distraction....look it's 2017....the 60's ended over 50 years ago...stop pretending you're oppressed...america doesn't buy it !
