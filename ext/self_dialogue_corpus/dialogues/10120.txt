How many Jason Bourne movies have they made?
Four I think.
The whole franchise has kind of run together at this point.
I'd agree.  Seems like they are out of ideas as he can only run from the government so much.
And Matt Damon ain't getting younger.  He must be at least 40 now.
The age doesn't bother me, but I just don't think there's much more of a story to tell.
The last movie was a bit of a drag.
Yeah, felt like a 'been there, done that' type of thing.
At least you get to see a lot of worldly locations in the films.
Very true - haven't seen them in Utah yet.
