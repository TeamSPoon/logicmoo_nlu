Whats the west looking like in the NBA?
The usual. The teams youd expect to be there are and the ones that arnt, arnt.
Yea, what do you mean by that.
Exactly what i said.
Ok, can you be more specific. Like with team names and all?
Golden State is in the western conference finals and the Spurs are winning vs the Rockets.
Whats the score vs the Rockets?
3-2 Spurs
Do you think the Rockets have a chance?
Well the next games at home so perhaps, i doubt it though.
Has it been a good series so far?
Yea its been pretty good. game five went to overtime.
Oh, then its been really good, a coin toss really.
Yea, i guess so. Gonna be hard for Houston to win two games in a row though.
What was the score in the other series?
Which?
The one that golden state won.
Oh. They beat the jazz four to nothing.
Wow, looks like they are the team to beat.
I guess we will see.
