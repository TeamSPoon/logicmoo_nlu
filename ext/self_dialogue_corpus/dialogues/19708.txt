Hey man, what do you think about Metallica?
I don't really know much about them.
Well they are one of the best heavy metal bands of all time.
Really?  I seem to recall hearing some of their songs back in the 90's on the radio.
Oh, the 90's are known as their sell out period.
Sell out?  What was wrong with their 90's music?
If you never heard their classics from the 80s I suppose Metallica's music from the 90's is OK.
"Enter Sandman" was a very popular song!
Ok, hahahaha, if you think so.  I think it was average at best.
Well I don't know why you are hating on a popular song of theirs!
I'm telling you if you have not heard their 80's music you have not heard Metallica at their best!
Ok, what should I listen to?
Well there are 4 key albums that you must listen to. They are "Kill 'Em All", "Ride the Lightning", "Master of Puppets" and "And Justice for All"
Ok, why did you say and twice?
And is part of the title of "And Justice for All".  Got it?
Got it.  Should I listen in any certain order?
Yes, in the order I gave the titles to you earlier.
Why listen to their music in that order?
That is in the order the albums were released.  You can hear how they start out and peak with "And Justice for All".
Ok, I will give Metallica's early works a listen.  Thanks for the info man!
