Do you follow the NFL coaching staff at all?
I'm really interested in stuff like that. I love the NFL as a whole.
Who do you think are the best coaches right now?
I think it goes without saying that Bill Bellichick holds the number one spot.
Yeah, you can't deny his ability as a head coach.
I don't think people realize the greatness that we're witnessing in his coaching abilities.
For sure. He'll be talked about for years to come.
Did you know he has as many championships as all the currently active coaches combined?
I didn't know that but I can believe it. That's crazy.
He also got hit with the biggest fine in NFL history.
Really? For what?
One of his employees got caught videotaping defensive hand signals from the Jets.
Wow. When did that happen?
It was back in 2007. Some people think they cheat because of that.
Well, I could see why.
A 500,000 dollar fine might make you stop cheating though.
That's true. I still think he's a great coach, though.
True. No one can deny there's talent there.
Do you think they'll go for championship number six this year?
I think it's highly possible. The Patriots are still a very strong team.
