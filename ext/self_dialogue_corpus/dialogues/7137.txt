What's the name of the movie with the house and the balloons?
"Up"
Oh that's right - I forgot the name of it.  I love that movie.
I know, the old man is so cute.
Ya, and it was kind of sad when they did the flashbacks with his wife.
That's what made the ending so great.
Right, when the house lands on beside the waterfall.
His wife would have loved that!
Ya it made me cry a little.
Me too.
