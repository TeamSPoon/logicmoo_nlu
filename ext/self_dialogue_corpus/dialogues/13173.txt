Did you actually watch the original Star Wars when it was originally released?
Yes I was seven years old in 1977.
Did you go by yourself?
No I went with one of my older sisters and my twin sister.
Do you really remember the whole movie?
Well first of all we got there a little late; but the first thing I remember seeing was Darth Vader on a ship walking among dead bodies.
I would say you missed about the first ten minutes of the movie then.
The other scene I remember is the one when Han Solo comes back after everyone believes he's gone.
Is that a the end of the movie?
Almost at the end of the movie, Darth Vader is about to shoot Luke's ship but Han saves him by shooting Darth's ship.
