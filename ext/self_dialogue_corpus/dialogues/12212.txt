I heard somewhere that someone died on the set of the new Star Wars movie?
What?  That didn't happen.
I thought I heard it somewhere.
I think you're obviously mistaken.
Oh, I know what it was.  It was actually Harrison Ford dying on the set.
You mean his character Han Solo in the last film.
Yeah.  Guess I got confused.
You guess?  You were way off.
Well, so many people die in these films it's hard to keep track.
It's not that hard!
