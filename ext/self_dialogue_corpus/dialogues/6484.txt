Have you seen Cool Runnings?
I've watched that, like, a million times.
They used to play it on TV all the time, huh?
Yeah, I also had in on VHS. The tape became grainy after watching it so much.
John Candy was great in it. I wish he would've lived longer.
Yeah, we missed out on so many great movies when he died.
I love how the movie still gets referenced today every Winter Olympics.
Especially if a bob sled team from a country that isn't cold enters.
Every time and Australian bob sled team tries to go there our media interviews them because of this movie.
It has quite a legacy.
