Who do you think is going to win the NFC this year?
I think it's a toss up between the Seahawks and Packers.
Have you heard about all the offseason drama with Seattle though?
No I thought they had a great offseason. What happened?
Apparently the locker room is pretty divided. The defense thinks Russell Wilson is getting special treatment.
I can see that, he is definitely treated like the golden child over there. Who do you think is behind the rumors?
Richard Sherman came out and made a statement in the media.
Wow, and he is definitely the emotional leader of that team. Which team might step up if the Seahawks dissapoints?
I like the Cardinals as a sleeper pick.
Really, even with an aging Carson Palmer and the loss of Calais Campbell?
Ya they have the best linebacking core in the NFC with the addition of Riddick.
Do you think the honey badger is going to stay healthy this season?
It's hard to say. I think if he makes it through the whole season, the Cardinals might have one of the better defenses in the NFL.
I could see that coming to fruition. Plus they have Bruce Arians who for my money might be the second best coach behind Bill Belicheck.
Ya I really like how outspoken he is. Speaking of Belicheck, is anyone going to be able to take down the Patriots in the AFC this year?
I wouldn't bet on it but I do like the Steelers.
Ya the one-two punch of La'Veon Bell and Antonio Brown is pretty unstoppable.
They are always on my radar for first round picks in my fantasy football league.
Absolutely. I'm not sure Big Ben Rothelisberger can handle too many more seasons though.
He takes a beating every year but somehow manages to play almost every game, it's incredible.
