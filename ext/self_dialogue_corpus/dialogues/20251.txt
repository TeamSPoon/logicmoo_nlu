What is your guilty pleasure movie
Oh, for sure it's the Wizard of Oz
Wow that is really a classic, but why guilty pleasure?
I guess a lot of people consider it to be an old film, seeing as it's from the 30's
I can see how that can be a turn off. How did you first start watching this movie
I used to watch it with a family member of mine
who?
My Grandma, she actually used to know Judy Garland way back in the day. Right after she starred in this movie.
That's amazing. Whats your favorite part of the film then?
It would have to be when dorothy first lands in munchkin land
Yeah, it's still a breath taking scene. Those colors!
Yeah, especially for the time it was release, the colors were amazing
I liked the scene with the tin man
oh you mean the song and dance number
yes that one!
it's such a classic! If I only had a heart is my favorite song from the movie
Really? I prefer the Cowardly Lions song
Is there a reason for that?
The lyrics are so much more hilarious!
Well i can't argue with you there.
