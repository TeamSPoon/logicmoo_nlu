lana del rey is one of the best pop artists, i don't know why she's always shit on
she kind of has a whiny voice
yeah, but her lyrics are good
yeah, when they actually make sense.
they always make sense!
are we going to forget that she had a song about her kitty tasting like pepsi cola?
honestly, i'm ready to forget about that song for an eternity. what about born to die?
way too emo, i have no interest in such a boring song
diet mountain dew is good, though
....yeah, can't really deny that
