I really miss 90s rap. The music today just doesn't reach me.
I know what you mean. That was my favorite era of music.
Who do you think was the best rapper of that era?
Actually, I liked the groups, like Outkast and the Wu-Tang Clan.
Hmm, those are two very different groups! Do you like any solo artists?
I think the rappers out of New York are the best. I really like Nas.
His music has such distinctive beats. Grimy, but somehow clear.
"If I Ruled the World" is a really touching song.
Do you like Jay-Z?
Yes, but not as much as Nas and the Wu-Tang Clan.
