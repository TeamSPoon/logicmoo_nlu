Have you seen Big Trouble In Little China?
No, I heard of it a long time ago.
One of my favorite movies.
Really? what is it about?
A truck driver delivers a load to San Francisco and he gets into a gambling game. And an old friend bets all his money to try and use it for a girl friend coming from China.
OK what is that all about?
Well he goes with his friend to the airport to pick up his girlfriend and a Gang kidnaps her.
Oh no, then what?
Well, they go looking for her and run into a gang fight, they run for their lives when three guys with super powers turns the fight around for the bad guys.
Sounds good, then what?
He loses his truck and end up at the restaurant, trying to figure out how to get her back. Well it turns out that Lo Pan a guy that is very old is going to marry her because she has green eyes.
Like a shot gun wedding?
Not really, it will make him mortal again and he has to kill her.
Oh crap.
Jack and a bunch of good guys go into the warehouse of Lo Pan and get girls out except for the girlfriend and the lawyer friend.
Then what?
They drink a magical potion that gives them super power like the bad guys. Then sneak in and save the girls with some Martial arts fighting.
Does the girl die?
Nope, they save her and the lawyer friend, killing Lo Pan and the bad guys.
Sound very good.
