I went to the mall and checked out some sales at the music store.
Really?  Did you find anything?
Yes I found some cds on Whitney Houston's music.
It was sad of her passing and her daughter.
Yes, it was.  I found a cd of hers, did you ever get Whitney Houston live?
No, but I have heard many of her songs.  Did you find that one there?
Yes, it was on sale. I also bought I will Always Love You.
That album was very popular, I do believe people called her the Voice.
Yes, she was definitely gifted, not many today have a voice like she had.
What are some of your favorite songs of hers?
I Wanna Dance With Somebody, I Will Always Love You, All The Man That I Need are my favorites.
Did you see any other artists work while you were down there?
I saw Bruno Mars, Miley Cyrus, Lady Gaga to name a few that had sales going on their music.
How much is the discount?
The sale is buy one get one half off.
I will need to go down there and see what treasures I can find too!
I did not bring enough cash for anymore, so I only bought Whitney's, a great deal.
One of my favorite memories of her was at a national Superbowl game.
She sang the national anthem, and lit the place up!
Oh,  I remember, she was amazing!
