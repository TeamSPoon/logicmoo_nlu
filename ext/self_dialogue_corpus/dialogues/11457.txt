What did you think of The Beatle's "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band" and the songs on that album?
I loved "I'm Fixing a Hole"...I find that it really used to echo something that I felt in my life.
Why do you say that?
I actually grew up in an old farmhouse. In my room, there was a spot on the ceiling caused by a leak, and I always wanted to fix it.
But the song was metaphorical. It was supposed to be about regrets, or something like that.
Yes, I felt like the leak was in some way my fault, having to do with my life, and things I had done and hadn't done.
And you identify with the song because of that?
Yes, I did. A lot of it also had to do with the arrangement of the song - you know, the sing-song like quality of it.
I'm not sure that I do...can you elaborate?
Well, the first part sounds like a person who is singing only to themselves. After that, it blossoms.
