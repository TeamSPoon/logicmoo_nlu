Have you seen the remake of dirty dancing?
Yes it was okay
I agree, the original was way better
Why do they feel the need to mess with a classic?
I dont know why they do that.
I fell like who they chose to play baby was all wrong
Exactly, dirty dancing is a sexual movie, and the baby they chose looks fifteen.
That's what I thought the whole movie, I hate when they pick the wrong actress
Me too, it pretty much messes up the whole movie
Just like twilight
Yea, those movies were horrible because of the actress that played bella
Shes not an actress, actresses express emotion
I dont know how she got the job
Me either
I was so excited to see twilight, and it was like watching a low budget film
I didn't watch any of the others after that
I did, They didn't get any better
I can imagine
The casting directors need to get better at this
I know
