I think my favorite thing about Beauty and the Beast is the setting and atmosphere.
I could never figure out what time period it is supposed to be in.
French Roccocco I think...
I can see that.
I'm just judging by the way the castle looked in the end of the movie, the sculptures were Roccocco.
Oh and that happened in France?
Yea, which explains the opening, why everyone was telling Belle, "Bonjour!"
Now that beginning makes sense!
You see, knowing these things makes the movie infinitely better.
Definitely, does.
