What is your top movie of the year so far?
I am torn between la la land and moonlight. what about you?
I really loved both , but prefer la la land. I am a huge ryan gosling fan. Have you seen drive?
Yes! I love that movie. So good, I especially liked the sound track.  Oscar issacs was in that  and he is really a great actor too.
Oscar is really getting a lot more known and deservedly so. He was awesome in ex machina, did you see it?
No what is it about?
It is about artiffical intelligence, there is a girl robot . I don't want to give away too much but worth a watch. It also has alicia vakander in it.
I like her. I will have to watch it soon. I loved her yellow dress at the oscars. Can you believe this year's best picture award issue?
No, it was so nuts! Never seen such a blunder. Poor  Emma stone. I felt so badly for her. She at least won for best actress.
That's true, weird to think of her as an academy award winner. I think back to films like zombieland and easy A, likeable but no oscar performance.
Agreed. they are fun films and when I see them on tv I will usually end up watching them. What films do  you find yourself watching over and over again?
Goonies.I have seen it so many times now. It always seems to be on tv.
Goonies is such a good 80's flick. I also love breakfast club.
Breakfast club is a classic and also on constantly.  they are remaking so many 80s films now.
I know, did you hear about the new blade runner?
Yes but not really a  true remake. It is a continuation of the original movie.
Oh cool! Ryan Gossling is it in too, right?
Yep, got to love that! Also Harrison Ford returns should be pretty awesome.
Ridley scott is pretty awesome in general. Totally excited for the new aliens movie by him too!
Agreed both ridley scott and the new alien movie are great!
