I saw The Hunchback of Notre Dame animated movie last night.
Cool.  Who directed that?
Gary Trousdale and Kirk Wise.  Released in 1996.
Who was the Hunchback?
Tom Hulce.
And Esmeralda?
Demi Moore. But she didn't sing.   Heidi Mollenhauer did.
Anyone else in it?
Kevin Kline was Captain Phoebus.
Neat.  Sounds like a pretty decent Disney movie.
