Hey I heard a new Chris Janson song on the Bobby Bones show the other morning.
Oh really?  What was it?
It was called Fix Me a Drink and I loved it!
That's funny, I only know of one other song by him.
Which one?
Buy Me a Boat.  Seems like all his songs are directions to do something for him.
That is funny, but seriously he makes great music!
Yeah, I do like the Buy Me a Boat song.  It's funny and has a good video.
I know.  I actually heard one he wrote that was about his baby daughter.  It was really sweet.
Oh really?  That seems out of place compared to his other music.
Yeah, it was surprising but really good.
I bet.  I think songs about artists' children are always sweet.
Yeah, like that one "I've Been Watching You"
Oh yeah, that's a real tear-jerker.
I know.  I tear up when I hear it too.
Well Chris Janson is coming out with some great new songs, I can't wait to see what he comes up with next.
Yeah, he's definitely on my radar.
Mine too.
Well check out that new Fix Me a Drink song and let me know what you think
I definitely will!
