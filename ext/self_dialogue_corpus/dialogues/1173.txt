Are you still a fan of the Bungles?
Who?
Excuse me, I mean the Cincinnati Bengals?
I still watch their games from time to time.
They haven't been good in years. I've pretty much given up on them.
I'm definitely not the fan I used to be. Who do you like now?
I support the Patriots mostly.
I see, so you're a fairweather fan.
What?
You just like whoever is winning.
Hey, I supported the Bengals for decades. When was the last time they won a championship?
1988.
See what I mean?
I guess so. Loyalty can only go so far.
Exactly.
I didn't realize it had been so long.
You should do your research before you accuse someone of being a fairweather fan.
At least there's hope. They didn't do too badly last year, and the year before that they made it to the Wildcard Playoffs.
If they can make it to post season consistently, I might be willing to give them another shot.
Fair enough.
