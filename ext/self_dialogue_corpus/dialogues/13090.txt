I always liked Han Solo.
Yes, he and Chewie make a great pair of characters.
It's too bad he died in The Force Awakens, but that is probably what Harrison Ford wanted.
True - it moved the story along and made Kylo an even more evil character.
Do you think that Kylo will be redeemed by the end of the trilogy?
I don't know - perhaps he and Luke will destroy each other and Rey will be a middle Grey Jedi?
It is possible that they will go that route - I wonder if Rey will make her own lightsaber.
I think that she will continue to use Luke's - maybe she is Luke's daughter!
I hope that John Williams write the music for Episode IX.
Me too - he needs to write some epic music for the final movie.
