Star Wars is now owned by Disney, right?
Yeah, Disney bought it from George Lucas I think two or three years ago now.
But are they really "Disney" movies? I mean, there's no songs or anything...
Well, there is the cantina scene in the new one. Not like the original, but still cantina-like.
You're being difficult. You know what I mean. Singing.
Sorry, I know what you mean. Yeah, I guess they are different in that way. But Disney also did live action movies without songs in the past.
Yeah, like The Black Hole, I used to love that movie. Especially the robots.
There was another one that scared the heck outta me, Watcher in the Woods I think it was called.
Yeah! I totally remember that. Well, I remember really liking it, but can't actually remember anything other than it was scary.
They need to make a reboot of that. Maybe in the Star Wars universe. I'd watch that for sure.
