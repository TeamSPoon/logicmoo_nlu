What is your favorite Disney movie of all time?
Silly as it sounds it has to be the Lion King.
That is a classic, I know a lot of people who love that movie.
We watch it all the time at my house. Even though I have seen it a million times I still cry when Mufasa dies.
I don't think it would make me cry but that part is sad when Simba is left all alone.
At least he finds Timon and Pumbaa to help him and show him family.
My favorite part is when they sing Hakuna Matata, Disney movies always have the best soundtracks.
I agree. The music makes the movie, it wouldn't be the same without it.
I love how they did the Lion King 1 1/2 it was funny from Timon and Pumbaa's point of view.
Yeah, it was funny seeing things from their perspective instead of the lions side.
