do you know death grips
that experimental hip hop group
yeah, do you like them
they are alright.
not your thing huh?
not too much. too glitchy for me
thats part of their appeal
glitchy aggression
yeah, the singer/rapper is intense
he's shy in person though
how would you know
i've just seen him in interviews
he doesnt speak much?
yeah, seems withdrawn
thats a bit strange.
youd expect him to be like a kanye
or like pac in terms of outspokenness
yeah but i guess music is his expressive outlet
yeah, so he isnt afraid there
or something like that
