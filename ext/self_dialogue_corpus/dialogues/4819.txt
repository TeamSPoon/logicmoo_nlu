Did you see the Phillies game yesterday?
Yeah they are not a good team.
Why do you say that?
Their pitching is terrible.
Is it relief or starting?
A little bit of both.
Whats worse?
I would say the relief pitching. Numbers wise.
Yeah the starter's ERA is not that bad.
I think it could be increased if they let them continue to pitch.
What do you mean?
They yank them in the 5th almost every game.
OK so that expends the relievers?
Yes and they arent that good to begin with.
So what do you think they need to do?
I would go build out the starting pitching first.
Once you can get through 6 then you go to the pen
So they dont need a closer?
Wait until theyre good
I understand
