Have your read any bios on musicians?
I just finished one.
Really, which one?
Pete Gabriele
I didn't know you liked him.
I don't, but the book looked good.
Was it?
No, it was a weak book.
Why?
I thought it was going to be a tell all.
What was it about.
His music and how he came into stardom.
It's sound good.
I like juicer books.
I hear the Montly cru book was good.
It is.I read that one.that's a tell all.
That's the best way to know what happens.
The raid looks like it could be fun.
Yes and very lonely.
I would love that life.
