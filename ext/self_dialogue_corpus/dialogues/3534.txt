What's a good horror movie to check out?
If you haven't seen it, I'd recommend A Nightmare on Elm Street.
The one that came out in 2010?
No, that is a remake and not nearly as good as the original. I'm talking about the one that was made in 1984.
Who is the main villain in that movie?
His name is Freddy Krueger, he has a burnt face and wears a glove with knives on his fingers.
So he just walks around and stabs people with his knife fingers?
Not exactly. He appears in people's dreams which if you think about it is pretty scary.
It's just a dream, what's scary about that?
Because if he kills you in the dream, you die in real life. Also that fact that you have to sleep eventually so there is no escape from him.
