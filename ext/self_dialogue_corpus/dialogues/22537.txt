Have you seen any independent movies recently?
I saw John Dies at the End
Is that any good
Oh yeah it's great
I also saw one called Cloudburst
With Olympia Dukakis?
Yes it was great
Another good one is called the Host
Oh, that was so funny and suspenseful.
David Hyde Pierce is incredible in it
I feel like Elijah Wood has done some good indie ones lately
Yes. He was in Maniac
And another recent one called I don't Feel at Home in this World Anymore
I really liked the tension in that one
Tucker and Dale versus Evil is also great
I didn't even realize that was independent
Oh yeah, I think they may make a sequel.
I would love that.
I want to watch Pariah
It is good and sad
