Was there a part of The Force Awakens that you didn't like?
Oh there were lots I didn't like!
Which part did you dislike the most?
I think it was when Han Solo tried to talk to Kylo Ren.
It was such a twist to find out he was their son!
I know, I was so shocked!
I totally hate what happened!
I know, I can't believe Kylo Ren tricked Han Solo.
I am just hoping Han Solo is still alive.
I wish that as well but I don't know if that will happen.
