Jacob, what's going today with the watch party?
You mean the football watch party?
Yeah man the Panther game, I have to see them win!
Who are they playing today?
They are playing the Saints, I have to invest time into this team with their new rookie.
Who is the new rookie?
You haven't heard they picked up Christian McCaffrey?
I hadn't heard, what position does he play?
He is a swift running back and I can see him doing well the blitz play offense of the Panths.
I wish you guys luck in that one, come over soon.
Thanks man, will do!
Don't forget that there are some Saints fans that might show up.
It is alright, I will just keep my jersey at home to remain neutral.
You won't be neutral when the Saints score!
How dare you say that, I got faith in the rookie squad.
Carolina is solid but the Saints run the East now!
Nobody runs Tom Brady, but they are definitely good with Drew.
It should be a good matchup.
Indeed, see you soon?
Yep, I'll bring the chips!
