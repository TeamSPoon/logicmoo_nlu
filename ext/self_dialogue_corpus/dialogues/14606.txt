Hey, did you see the Indians game last week?
Which game? They played more than once.
The one on Friday.
Oh, yeah. They played the Royals, right?
Yeah, I think so.
Yeah, I remember that one now. They lost.
Do you know what the score was?
I think it was 3-1.
Ouch. Was it a close game?
No, not really.
That's okay, we've still been doing fairly well this season.
Yeah, our offense is pretty solid.
True, but we are in a weak division.
Yeah. Do you think we'll be back in the playoffs this year?
I hope so.
We had a really good run last year.
We came so close to winning it all!
We sure did! Hey, hopefully this is the year.
With the Cavs championship win, I know Cleveland would love another.
For sure.
