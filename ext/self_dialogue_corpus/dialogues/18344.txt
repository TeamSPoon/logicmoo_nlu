Do you remember the 2004 Grammys?
No. Why do you ask?
That was the year that Coldplay beat Beyonce for Record of the Year
Oh yeah, for what song?
Clocks
That was a really good song.
Yes, I agree. Big controversy since Beyonce didn't win.
What song did she make back then?
Crazy in Love.
Oh, the one with Jay Z
Yes, that's the one.
Yeah, I remember that one. I wasn't a fan.
Yeah, me neither.
What else came out that year?
Eminem with Lose Yourself
Oh that was a catchy one.
Yeah, I remember it was big in his 8 Mile movie.
Yes, part of the soundtrack.
Is he still around?
I believe so, but I haven't heard any of his music for awhile now.
