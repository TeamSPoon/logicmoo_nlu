I did not like the actor who played ron
Why did you not like ron
He was just to whiney and felt out of place
I thought he matched the persona of the books
Not at all he was so off base
I just feel the opposite
But how though
He just felt and looked the part hard to describe it
I mean he did look it
Exactly though and thats half the battle
