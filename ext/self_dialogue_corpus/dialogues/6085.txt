Did you hear about the next Disney Pixar movie coming out this year?
No, what is it?
I think it is called Coco. It centers around the Mexican Day of the Dead.
El Dia de Los Muertos? No, I haven't heard. When is it coming out?
I think it is coming out in October.
Oh that makes sense; around Halloween.
Yes. It looks like it will be very good.
Will it have sugar skulls in it?
Oh definitely. The animation looks very nice and I think I've seen those.
I like how Disney has become more multicultural.
