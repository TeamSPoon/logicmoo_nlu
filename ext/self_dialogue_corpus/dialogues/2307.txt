Are you excited for football?
I am always excited.
Who do you think will do better.
I think the falcons will take it all.
I think the cowboys will make their way.
They are good too.
Yeah they have alot of young players.
They have some good ones.
I think with them being younger int he nfl it helps alot.
I do to.
It makes them seem healthier.
I agree.
I think it helps them not get as injured as much.
Yeah the older ones get hurt more.
I think the younger ones bodies can handle more.
I agree. I think they sustain more.
I think they take care of their bodies better.
They also have not had the experience the others do.
It will be exciting to watch.
I cannot wait to se it.
