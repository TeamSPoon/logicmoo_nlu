Madonna is such a talented artist. It's a shame that her album sales have been so low.
Her last great album was Hard Candy. I don't even know any of the songs from Rebel Heart.
Hard Candy was amazing. I love the song 4 Minutes.
That song is so catchy, and anything with Justin Timberlake is a win.
Come to think of it I can't think of anything he's released recently.
Neither can I. The only songs I know of his are What Goes Around Comes Around and My Love.
I can't believe how long it's been since those songs were released!
It's crazy, isn't it?
Maybe Madonna and Justin should do another song together.
I would love to hear what they could come up with.
