Who is your favorite Star Wars character?
My all time favorite is Yoda.
Why is Yoda your favorite?
He is so wise and he is little and green!
Yoda is cool, but not as cool as Chewbaca!
What is so great about Chewy?
He is huge and scary but he has a soft side.
It is pretty funny to see him with Han Solo.
Yes they have some interesting conversations.
Yoda is still the best!
