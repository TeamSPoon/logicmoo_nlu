Have you ever seen the movie Blue Streak?
Nope. What is that about?
It is a buddy cop movie.
Who is in that movie?
Luke Wilson and Martin Lawrence. They are hilarious.
What do they do in that movie?
They try to find a diamond that Martin Lawrence actually was stealing.
Wow. That sounds so good.
It is a great movie. It's a classic and is much better than Bad Boys in my opinion.
Bad Boys was pretty underwhelming. I will check out Blue Streak.
