Have you ever seen Kill Bill?
Volume one, or two?
Both; They're fantastic.
I think I caught a bit of volume one but I can never find them.
They're amazing, I think they might be the best movies ever made.
Really? I wonder where I can find them.
I found both on television; but they were toned down.
How toned down?
A lot of the Bride stuff was missing from the first volume, at the beginning?
Oh, I think I know what you mean.
Yeah, so what I did was I went out and bought a copy of both of them.
Were they really worth that?
More than, plus, they've got bloopers.
I love bloopers, in such serious movies too?
They're the best, right?
Absolutely, I think I should go pick those up.
You honestly should, they're so great.
Then I definitely will, how much were they?
Twenty for both, a bargain I'd say.
Then it's settled, I'm definitely buying them.
