I really miss Brian's character.
Me too.  Paul Walker was so great in his role.
Did you notice that they tried to replace him in the latest Furious movie?
How so?
They introduced Scott Eastwood's character as another Brian.  A law man who goes rogue.
Now that you mention it, he even drove a similar blue car as Brian.
Exactly.  I understand why they would try to do it, but I don't think it was executed correctly.
Indeed.  His character had a few lines but played no major role.
There was a period of maybe 20 minutes or so where he just wasn't on screen.
Maybe they will better utilize his character in Fast 9.
