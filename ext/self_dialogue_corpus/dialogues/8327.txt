What's the most recent Pop CD that you purchased?
I bought Imagine Dragon's new CD, but I don't think you could consider that "POP".
I think you would consider that pop music.
If that's the case, I purchased Imagine Dragon's CD last.
That's cool.  What's your favorite song?
I really like "Thunder".
That's a great song, I listed to it pre-release on Youtube.
Same here.  As soon as I heard it I pre-ordered it with Amazon.
Do you buy a lot of pop music CDs from Amazon?
I usually listen to my music on Amazon music with their free streaming service with Prime.
