Have you seen Vera Wang's new dresses for spring?
I have! I always love her style; she's mysterious and dark while being trendy and fresh at the same time.
I agree, although I tend to be more on the mysterious and dark side of things, haha.
Haha, yeah, you do. What's your favorite dress in her new collection?
The long, silky black maxi dress with the lace at the neckline.
I knew you'd say that!
It can be dressed up or dressed down with accessories and shoes and I like multi-purpose clothing.
So do I!
What's your favorite of her new dresses this year?
The 1940s-inspired cream floral one, I think. It's long enough to be dressy but short enough to be fun.
I agree! I really like all three of the patterns in the 40s series this year.
Is the midnight blue and stars one your favorite?
Yeah, it is! You know me so well! Have you bought any yet?
No, I haven't. Besides, Vera Wang also has a set of silk camisoles out, so I couldn't decide what to get.
Really? I didn't know she designed camisoles!
She hasn't until this season. I think I might want to buy some.
Me too! Really versatile, it looks like. Of course, I love lace necklines.
We should go look at her new collection at the mall later!
I agree!
I love Vera Wang's style.
