Did I tell you that I am going to a Linkin Park concert?
No that is awesome. When is the concert?
It is August 14 and it is hosted by live nation.
Oh I think my cousin is going to that concert as well.
That is awesome. Do you know where they are sitting?
I think they are in the second row.
That is really close to where I am sitting.
Oh really? Where are your seats?
I am in the fifth row.
How much did your tickets cost?
They were only around $100.
That is extremely cheap. Are you sure they are real?
Yes, I purchased them from livenation.com.
It must be because you go to concerts all the time.
Yes it is actually.
Are there any other concert you are going to?
Currently there isn't any other people I would like to see.
Yes that is actually why I am not going to any concerts.
You know how much I love music though.
You love music more than anybody that I know.
