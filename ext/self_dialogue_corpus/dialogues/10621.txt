Can you believe how many fast and the furious movies there are?
I know, it’s almost crazy that they keep making them but they are so good!
Which one is your favorite and which one is your least favorite?
I would say number 1 is my favorite because it’s the original and number 2nis my least favorite?
Really? You don’t like number 2?
I thought it had the worst acting and the bad guy was not a good bad guy.
I know what you mean, the bad guy is a little weak in that movie.
What about you? What’s your favorite?
I would have to say number 6! I don’t know why, it just is my favorite.
Yes, I know what you mean, number 6 has a great story line.
