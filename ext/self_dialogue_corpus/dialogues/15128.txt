who do you wish you could see in concert?
Do they have to be alive?
no, just your dream concert.
I would say the beatles. They are one of my favorite bands ever and feel it would have been something to see them in person live.
Indeed they were pretty incredible.  I think mine would be Elton John.
Well it is still possible for that to happen for you.
fingers crossed.I adore him so much. He is so talented it blows my mind.
What is your favorite elton song?
Rocketman is probably my favorite.But there are so many others I love.
What are the top three after rocketman?
Your song, tiny dancer and crocodile rock or strike that bennie and the jets.
Those are all great tracks, I forget how many hits he has had.
so many, we have not even brought up candle in the wind or can you feel the love tonight.
That was in lion king right?
Sure was and nominated for an oscar for best original song and won!
I did forget about that win. Wow. The other was about princess diana right?
Well the original was actually a tribute to marilyn monroe. Then updated after diana's passing.
They were close friends I believe, right? He and princess diana.
They had been very close friends but before her passing they had been in a fight I think. Like she was giving him the silent treatment or something.
That is tragic to be in a fight with anyone you care about and then have then pass before you can make amends.
