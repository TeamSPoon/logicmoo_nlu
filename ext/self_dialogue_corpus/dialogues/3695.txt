I saw a real cool movie on Netflix the other day called Looper.
The one with Bruce Willis?
And Joseph Gordon Levitt with weird Bruce Willis makeup.
Yeah, that was kind of interesting to see.
The movie was very creative.  The very premise was interesting.
I loved the ending to that movie.
How he shoots himself to save the child?
Right.  It was the only thing he could do to change the course of time.
Very creative use of space I thought.
I wish more movies had a sense of physics such as this one.
