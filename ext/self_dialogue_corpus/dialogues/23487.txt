Are you going to the movies this weekend?
Possibly, is there anything good showing?
"God of War" looks interesting.
What's that about?
It's about Chinese soldiers in the 1500's that take on pirates from Japan.
Is it a foreign film?
I think it's in both English and Chinese.
That sounds good. Who directed it?
Gordon Chan is the director.
What else has he done?
I think "The Four 3" and "Lawless Kingdom."
I've never seen those.
I think it's playing at the AMC in Orange this weekend. Do you want to go?
I don't really like foreign films. This one sounds interesting, though.
What have you got to lose? What else would you see this weekend?
I was thinking of watching "Wonder Woman."
Oh please, you can download that from Youtube. Give something new a try.
Yeah. Why not? I'll see "God of War" with you.
Ok. Meet me at the AMC by 11 for the matinee showing of the movie.
Oh boy. I get to watch a subtitled movie and save money too. Can't wait.
