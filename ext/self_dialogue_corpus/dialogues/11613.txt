Can you tell me anything about the Abbey Road by the Beatles? I really like that one.
Sure. Abbey Road was the 11th studio album by the Beatles that was released in 1969. The interesting thing about it was it was the last album all four participated on.
Wasn't it true that the famous cover was based on a Paul McCartney sketch?
Yes, the legend has it Paul sketched the idea.
Can you tell me more about the famous shoot for the cover?
The photo was taken on August 8 1969 outside EMI studios on Abbey Road at 11:35 am in the morning.
Do you know who the photographer was that took that famous shot?
It was Iain Macmillian who interesting enough was only given 10 minutes to get the shot because the cops would only allow traffic to be stopped for 10 minutes.
Is there a legacy for that walk?
Oh, yes it is probably the most famous walk in popculture that still gets talked about today.
