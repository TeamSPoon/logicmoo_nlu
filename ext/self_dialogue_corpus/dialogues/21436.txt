I watched Life the other day and it was a really good Science Fiction horror. It reminded me of a cross between Aliens and Event Horizon.
Is that the movie with Jake Gyllenhaal, Rebecca Ferguson, and Ryan Reynolds?
That's the movie. It just released a month ago or so, but I didn't hear much about it.
I read some message boards about it and they really seem to give it good ratings. Tell me about it.
The movie is about a crew of astronauts up in a space station that just discovered a life form from Mars. So now they're researching and learning about it.
Don't tell me, this life form becomes a threat and everyone is fearing for their lives!
Yes, that's what eventually happens, but there are a few surprises along the way. I also really enjoyed the scientific approach they took to learning about the life form.
What do you mean?
Well it wasn't just an action horror fest, it dealt with some what realistic scenarios of how things would be if scientist really did find another life form.
How did the life form look? Was it scary?
At first no, it was just an amoeba looking shape like a large cell. It was really interesting. It seem friendly too until provoked!
Who's the hero of the movie, Ryan or Jake?
I can't spoil it for you but it'll surprise you. I can tell you Jake plays his usual character self he always plays.
You mean the isolated kind of anti social guy?
That's it. He's always so good playing that type of character. Ryan plays his usual outspoken, dry humor self too. Not exactly Deadpool though.
I can imagine it. I think I've only seen one movie where Ryan Reynolds was serious and truly terrifying.
Oh you mean that Amityville Horror remake where he was the dad that goes insane?
He was so terrifying in that!
He's pretty good in Life. I would recommend it. I enjoyed it a lot, had mixed feelings on the ending, but overall very entertaining.
Sounds good. I'll remember that. Thanks for the recommendation.
