So that's what happened in that mnovie.
Um. Didn't you say you watched it?
yes. but it was hard to follow because I didn't watch the first one.
Eh, the polot is kinda convoluted with a lot of new characters in the sequel. so even if you watched the first one, it would still be kinda weird.
What do they call those gun shooting scenes? Gun Fu?
Yep. began in Hong Kong movie scenes. Not sure who originated the term Gun Fu though, and I kinda don't care.
But it's so total bad ass. Like gun is used almost as a prop for martial arts. Totally surreal
John Woo is the one who more or less invented that genre
Too bad all his movies are more or less the same.
He lacks imagination in plot development.
yeah, but his version of mission impossible sucked too. He's just not that great at directing.
We all get old and peoole get tired of what we do. It's just life.
So the part three is gonna be when?
They're making it now I think. So next year? Or the year after?
I bet it's goign to be the final one where John Wick dies after he dismantles the High Table for good.
That would fit the image of our hero.
Yep, totally, like, all he's ever wanted was a quiet life with his wife. Now she's dead, puppy too, and the car's stolen. And taking the revenge on all that made him a marker
Well Santino had the marker on him which he wasn't supposed to use unless someone come out of retirement.
Wait, so that's what happened to John wick>? it was killing those who killed his puppy that made him available again or, however you want to describe it?
Yes. Santino couldn't have demanded the marker from Wick had Wick not killed the Russian mob for killing his puppy. it would've stayed buried. That's where the irony is. Demaning justice for John demands more injustices for John. It's an instant classic.
