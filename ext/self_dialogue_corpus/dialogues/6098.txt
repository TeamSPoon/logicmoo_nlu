Have you seen Moana?
Oh I did, it was great! The way the ocean was its own character was fascinating.
I know and the songs are so addictive. I've been singing "You're Welcome" since I saw it.
I know me too! It's almost as bad as Let it Go.
Almost. I had that song stuck in my head for weeks.
Did you know it was The Rock Dwayne Johnson doing the voice of Maui?
I didn't know that until after I saw it. He has a pretty decent singing voice.
Yeah who would have thought it? I loved him in CIA Central Intelligence.
He was actually pretty funny in that, him and Kevin Hart.
The Rock plays equally well doing cute and playful characters as he does playing tough guys.
