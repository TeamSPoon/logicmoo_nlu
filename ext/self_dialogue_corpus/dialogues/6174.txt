Did you ever see Bambi?
A long time ago when I was a kid my mom took me to see it. I've never seen it since.
Either have I and I'd like to.  One of my earliest memories is my mother taking me to see it in Alaska.
Really at the theater?
Well kind of. It was on the Aleutian Islands back in the late sixties and the theater was an old WWII Quonset Hut and there was about fifteen of us in there.
Wow, that's different.  Did you like the movie?
I remember that I did and of course I know the story of Bambi and oh, that rabbit.  What's his name?
Thumper and Flower the skunk.
That's right.  How could I forget Thumper.  One of the most famous rabbits out there.
Rates rite up there with Peter Cotton tail.
