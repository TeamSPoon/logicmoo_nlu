What's your favorite film?
Hard to choose, I have several - I love The Godfather and Fight Club.
Me too! Have you seen The Godfather sequels?
Yeah, I still prefer the first one though. I know a lot of people like The Godfather 2.
I didn't like it all that much, to be honest.
Me neither.
Fight Club is great though. And so true to the book.
Yeah, most film adaptations of Palahniuk's books stay pretty true.
I guess the story is already so good, why mess with it?
Exactly. Brad Pitt really killed it in Fight Club.
Yeah, the casting was perfect in that movie. Norton and Bonham Carter did great too.
Totally, I can't imagine any one else playing any of those parts.
Do you like any of David Fincher's other films?
He's one of my favorite directors - I love Se7en.
Another one where Brad Pitt was awesome! Kevin Spacey absolutely makes that movie.
You spend so long waiting to see him, but it still isn't a let down.
And he's genuinely really scary!
I know! I would never think Kevin Spacey could be such a scary character.
He's really creepy in American Beauty, too.
Oh yeah, he's great at that mid-life-crisis kind of crazy.
