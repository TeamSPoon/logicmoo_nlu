Have you seen 'Okja' on Netflix?
Yes, I just watched it!
What did you think?
I absolutely loved it.
Me too.
Netflix really outdid themselves this time.
Yea, I couldn't believe it at first when the news came out that a Bong Joon Ho movie was going to be on Netflix.
Isn't he the Korean director of 'The Host' and 'Snowpiercer?'
Yes he is.  And both those movies were good too.
I just loved how touching this one was.
While at the same time, biting criticism of corporations and animal cruelty.
If you are able to balance serious issues with lighthearted elements, that is a sign of great directing, writing, and acting.
Great movie-making overall.
Ahn Seo-hyun as the little girl, Mija, was so good.
She really is talented.  Though my favorite was Paul Dano's character.
Paul Dano is a unique actor in that, any role he plays is 100% believable.
I was glad to see Steven Yeun in this as well.
Glad he's doing movies after 'The Walking Dead.'
I hope this movie gets awards during Awards season.
I think it will.  I'm also planning on seeing it in theaters during the limited release run.
