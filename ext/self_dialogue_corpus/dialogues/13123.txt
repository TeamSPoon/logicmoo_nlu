Have you ever watched the Star Wars movies?
Of course.  Who hasn't?
Which one is your favorite?
I'll admit that I liked the first batch that were made.  I think the stories were easier to follow?
I know.  I liked the characters.  I especially liked Han Solo.
Yes.  He was cool and crazy all at the same time.
I also thought Darth Vader was scarier.  The new ones seem to have too many bad guys that you don't focus just on the one.
Yes.  He was pretty creepy.  I thought he was particularly creepy when he took his mask off.
It wasn't at all what I expected when I saw that.
Those really were some great characters and story lines.
