I finally completed my goal of seeing every movie on the AFI top 100 list
Wow that is impressive. What was your favorite movie?
Tha'ts a tough question but the  one that comes to mind is Casablanca.
That's a great movie. I loved the acting by Humprey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman.
Ya that's one of my favorite things too. And the story line being set during World War II.
Oh that's right and isn't Humprey Bogarts character having to stay in Casablanaca?
Yes he owns an upscale nightclub there and also a place for gambling.
I still remember the song from the movie.
Ya played by Sam. It was a really great song.
Ya then you learn to back story between the two main characters and how they were in love.
There are some great quotes from that movie I bet people use and don't even realize they are from that movie.
"Of all the gin joints, in all the towns, in all the world, she walks into mine." Is one I remember.
You can't forget "Here's looking at you kid"
Oh and "We'll always have Paris." Isn't that from that movie?
Ya it is. Some really great lines.
I think I need to watch that movie again after we just talked about it.
You should and you will have to tel me what stands out to you.
Well I'm sure the song will for sure.
Ya and that song was also used in some other movies.
I know it was in Sleepless in Seattle.
