The Yankees are doing well this season, don't you think?
Yeah, for sure. They have one of the best records in the MLB.
How'd they get so good again all of a sudden?
Well, they have a strong roster. Especially those young guys, Gary Sanchez and Aaron Judge.
Can you believe Judge already has 13 home runs?
I guess being 6'7" gives a guy some real power.
Did you see the Yankees, Cubs game last night?
Some of it, I couldn't stay up for all 18 innings.
Neither could I. It's like a double header in one game.
Speaking of the Cubs, do you think they have a chance to repeat this year?
Well, maybe, but they sure aren't getting off to a start like they did last season.
True, and they did just get swept by the Yankees.
They're only one game above 500 right now, so not so promising a start.
They have time to figure it out though. It's a long season.
True, but even if they do, I bet they'll have a tough time getting past the Nationals.
Bryce Harper could be MVP this year.
Yeah, and they have Murphy batting right behind him.
Can't forget the pitching, the Nationals may have the best rotation in the league.
Of course you never know who might go down from injury.
True, it's such a long season, can't count on all the guys being there at the end.
