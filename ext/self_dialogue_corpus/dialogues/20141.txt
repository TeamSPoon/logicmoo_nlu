So, I just got into David Lynch films.
What do you thin of him?
I like his Fire Walk With Me movie.
The sort of prequel of Twin Peaks?
Yes, it is a dark movie.
I like the way he is both dark and eerily funny in his movies.
Dumbland was like that.
I do not think I ever seen it, when was it made?
It came out in 2002.
What are some of his better known ones?
Mulholland Drive won some awards.
That one was dark and sad.
I loved it, he has sort of cult ones too.
I loved the one called Eraserhead.
That was like a horror film right?
Yes, he does suspense really well.
He made one I saw, called The Elephant Man.
That one was so sad!
He also does Sci-fi well.
He directed Dune right?
