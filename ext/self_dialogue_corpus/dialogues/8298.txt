Hey, what's your favorite pop song at the moment?
I really like Ed Sheeran's "Shape Of You".
Awesome! I like that one too, it's my ringtone for my boyfriend!
Seriously?! That's so cool, it's a great song for sure!
Yeah, it is! Do you like anything by Justin Bieber?
YES! I love the song "Let Me Love You".
Great minds think alike! Same here! That's my number one fave at the moment.
Too cool! Isn't it written by DJ Snake?
Yes, DJ Snake is the artist and JB is featured in the song.
That's what I thought! Awesome!
