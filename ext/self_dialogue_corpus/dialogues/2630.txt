How old was Gale Sayers when he was inducted into the hall of fame?
He was 34. That's 4 years younger than Peyton Manning.
Really? I did not know that.
Do you know who the was the only coach in NFL history to average more than one playoff win in 10+ seasons of coaching?
Wasn't that Joe Gibbs?
Yeah. The Washington Redskins, right?
Yep. Gibbs had 17 playoff wins in his 16 years, and 17 in his first 12 with the Redskins.
That's quite the record.
I know. John Harbaugh currently has nine playoff wins in seven seasons.
Yeah, I heard both Bill Walsh and Jimmy Johnson had 10 playoff wins in 10 seasons too.
That's consistently a pretty good team.
I agree. I'm Green Bay fan myself.
Really, they're okay. Their team logo looks a lot some college down south, doesn't it?
It should. Vince Dooley "borrowed" the look of the "g" for the Georgia Bulldogs.
Oh that explains it. I thought I had seen it some where else.
Yeah, they say it's the highest for flattery but it was our first!
Okay, okay. You Packers fans are die hards!
They don't call us cheeseheads for nothing!
Yeah you seem like a cheddar to me!
Hey you are what you eat!
