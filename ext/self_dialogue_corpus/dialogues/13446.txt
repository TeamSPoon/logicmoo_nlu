How old were you when you first started watching Star Wars?
I didn't see the first one until two years ago.
Wow! I've been watching then over and over again since I was 6 years old.
My boyfriend is a real Star Wars geek. He's been educating me on the movies lately.
Oh I know he's having fun with that. You know they've been running a marathon on TNT.
Yes that's how we've been watching them. We don't actually own any of them yet.
I loved Revenge of the Sith. That's my favorite of the first three episodes.
That's mine too. I loved watching Anakin Skywalker's evolution.
Hayden Christensen did an excellent job I think, embodying Anakin.
I agree. Natalie Portman did an awersome job as well.
