I really think that they under utilize Princess Leia in all of the Star Wars movies.
What do you mean?
Well if she's the only other living relative of Darth Vadar and can wield the Force like Luke and Vadar, shouldn't she be getting Jedi training?
She is in command of things back at the base of operations.
Exactly, they are leaving her back at home while they go fight the battles.  It seems to me like she should be more involved.
But she comes up with all of the battle plans and lays everything out.
Actually you never see her do that.  Once they start an actual battle plan she is left out of it, other characters go through the plans of attack.
She brings all the people to the table, people wouldn't even be there to fight if not for her.
I still think they should give her a bigger role, she should be moving things with her mind and flying a ship.  In all of the attack scenes like when they are destroying the Death Stars in A New Hope and Return of the Jedi it's the weird lobster guy who gives all the orders.
I think you are underestimating her influence.  I think you see it much more in Force Awakens where she is running the base for the Resistance.
