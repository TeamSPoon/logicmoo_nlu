You know who I used to love back in the day?
Who is that?
Alicia Keys. I enjoyed her song "Falling".
Me too! That song reminds me of when I was in high school.
Yes! I always wished I could play the piano like her.
Me too. She has such a beautiful voice as well.
She's married now and has 2 kids.
Do you know who she ended up marrying?
I think it was Swizz Beatz.
Oh right I remember that now! They make a cute couple.
I agree. They really do.
I still listen to Alicia Keys music to this day.
I do sometimes too. Also John Legend is great.
Yes I loved his music too. So soulful and just relaxing.
I could listen to his voice all day.
Me too, what is your favorite from him?
I love his song "All of Me".
That is such a pretty song.
I know! I listen to it a lot.
He has an amazing voice.
