Have you seen Big Hero 6?
I did! I watched it with my friends.
Did you like it?
I loved it! The scene where Hiro watches his brother test Baymax was a real tear-jerker.
Yeah  cried like a little baby on that scene. There's a rumor going around that they're planning on a prequel.
I don't think that'll work. What do you think?
Well, Disney isn't really known for making good prequels or sequels.
True. The movie was great, better than Frozen even.
That's what I think so too. A prequel or sequel would just ruin it.
Yea, not a big fan of sequels nor prequels.
