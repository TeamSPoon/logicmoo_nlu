Were you a fan of the Cowboys in the 90s?
The football team?
Yeah, Dallas.
Oh, who wasn't?
Yeah, it seemed like everyone was a fan.
Even if you lived across the country you loved Dallas.
Yeah, they were like America's team.
That was back when Aikman was the quarterback, right.
Yeah, I remember Emmitt Smith was the running back then.
Oh, yeah.  Did you have one of those big jackets everyone wore?
One of the Starter jackets?
Yeah, they were popular then.
My brother had one of the Dallas Starter jackets.  It was blue with the big Dallas star on it.
Yeah, everyone had those.  You'd see a lot of Cowboy fans wearing them.
What does Troy Aikman do now?  I know I've seen his face recently.
He's a sports anchor now.
Oh, on what channel?
I think it's on Fox.
I must have seen him commentating over the past few seasons.
That's very likely.
