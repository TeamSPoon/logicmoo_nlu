Do you remember the flying car scene in Harry Potter I believe it was in Chamber of Secrets.
No what flying car scene?
You know the one where Ron returns and Harry is saved?
Barely can you give a bit more detail?
The car was a Ford Anglia and Harry was trying to escape the Hursleys, ringing a bell?
Oh yeah I remember now.
I just finished watching that scene and had to pause the movie.
Why?
So I could ask you about it and tell you it was awesome.
Okay now i'm getting nostalgic.
