Did you like Van Halen?
I liked some of their songs.
Me too, wasn't too thrilled with the band members.
Me either.
David Lee Roth wasn't a good front man.
No, not a good person to look at.
Eddie Van Halen was the best member in the band.
Why Can't this Be Love  with Sammy Hagar as their lead singer was a great song.
That was, but I love his Hagar.
Yes, I know you do.
