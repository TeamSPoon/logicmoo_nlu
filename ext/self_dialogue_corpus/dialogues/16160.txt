What's up with Taylor Swift these days?
I have no idea. I listen to her music but I don't try to keep up with anything having to do with her life outside of music.
I always try to keep up with good juicy drama but yeah, you like Taylor Swift's music?
She is one of my favorite singers.
I like her songs but I can't say she is my favorite.
I have all five of her albums and so far had gone to two of her concerts.
She seems like a very classy lady outside of music and in, it seems.
That and she evenly popular with adults and teens. I love the way she writes and her sings her songs about her ex-boyfriends.
Seriously. It is said through the grape-vine that she has dated and dumped a lot of well known men.
True, but many people tend to over-look that due to her popularity as a celebrity and an artist.
I could agree with that. Which song of hers is your favorite?
There is not really one song that I love more then the others. But I can personally relate to one in particular.
Which one is that one?
Her song Bad Blood, when I listen to it, it brings me back to what my ex-boyfriend and I went through. I remember reciting the lyrics to him at one point.
In all honesty wouldn't every song she has ever sung relate to something like that?
Very funny.
Seriously though, through all the drama and the gossip following her. I think she is great and she has amazing taste in men.
True that. To bad she never could find one to stick with for good.
Nah, I don't think that would have worked out for her. If she found one to stick with her then she would never have been able to come up with so many juicy songs.
Now that is bringing her song lyrics Blank space come into mind, "Ain't it funny, rumors fly. And I know you heard about me. So hey, let's be friends I'm dying to see how this one ends."
