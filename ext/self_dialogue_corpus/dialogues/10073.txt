Have you seen the new Pirates movie yet?
Not yet.  I heard it was just okay.
That's pretty accurate.  The plot was better than some other movies.
That's what I hate about some of these movies. They can be an incoherent mess.
This one is much simpler.
How was Johnny Depp in this one?
It was kind of weird.  He wasn't a focus as much as I thought he would be.
He is getting old, 50-something by now.
I'm not so sure they'll be another movie in the franchise.  They've milked this thing.
If there's cash to be made, expect another one.
