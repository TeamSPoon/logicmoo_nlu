Do you like basketball?
Yeah, I do I used to play?
Really, at what level?
Just college. Do you follow pro ball?
Yes, I do. Who is your favorite team?
I like the Jazz alot. How about you?
I do not really have one, but maybe the Lakers.
Oh yeah, they are great. Do you have a favorite current player?
Steph Curry for sure, how about you?
I would have to go with Lebron James.
I thought he was retired?
Not really not yet. Maybe he will pull a Jordan.
I could see him plating pro in other stuff, who is your favorite old school or retired player?
Shaq, and you?
I would go with Jordan.
Do you think Curry will get traded any time soon?
No, he is doing really well I wonder if James Harden will though.
You think so? I doubt it. He is pretty solid.
You may be right. Do you follow his team alot?
I do, I think I like his as well.
