So sad about Chris Cornell
Yeah, I saw that in the news, but I don't really know much about him...
Seriously? He is legendary!
Maybe if you could tell me what he has done.
Sure! He was the lead vocalist for audioslave, Soundgarden, and was also part of Temple of the Dog
Ok, that rings some bells, did he do that song "The moon and back"?
No, you're thinking of someone else. Soundgarden did the song "Black Hole Sun"
Oh! That song was on the radio all the time! I love that song!
That's Cornell's voice, but it's not even his best work.
What would you recommend?
Well, if you like grunge, check out "Fell on Black Days" and for more upbeat ones try "The Day I Tried to Live" or "Spoonman"
I will check those out.
You may also like "Rhinosaucer" (at least I do)
What about the other works, audioslave or Temple of the Dog
Ok, for Temple of the Dog try "Say Hello to Heaven" as my favorite song
I've heard it before actually, what about Audioslave.
The best ones are the fast ones like "Moth" or "Shape of Things to Come" but slower pieces are better from his acoustic album.
Which pieces should I look for?
Try "Thank You" and my all time favorite "Like a Stone"
I will check those out!
