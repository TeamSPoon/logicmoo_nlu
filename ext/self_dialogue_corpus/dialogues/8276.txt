Are you a fan of the pop group "One Direction"?
I am not, but I do like the solo stuff.
Did you hear Harry Style new song?
He has a few, maybe "Sign of the Times"?
That is it! It was amazing, so well written.
I think so too. It was a really well structured song.
When I heard it, it reminded me of like Beatles pop music.
That pop feel, but deep meaning?
Yes! His new solo stuff is so deep, but also fun to listen too.
I think he is going to do well on his own, his new pop stuff is very good.
