Hey do you like the Beatles?
Yeah I love them, and so do most of my friends
Who is your favorite member? I think mine is Paul but I haven't really made up my mind
Yeah I like Paul and John, but I think George was the most underrated, unless you count Ringo
No one ever counts Ringo, it seems like
They finally inducted him into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a solo artist, though, so that's cool
Yeah, I really liked Octopus's Garden that he wrote with George
That's a great song, just like Yellow Submarine, which is a classic
People don't give Ringo enough credit for his drumming, either
Oh yes, he's one of the greatest drummers of all time, no question
