Who's your favorite composer?
I don't know, I don't really have a favorite. Who's yours?
My favorite is Dmitri Shostakovich.
That's quite a mouthful. Is he Russian?
Yes.
Are you from Russia? Why do you like that kind of Music?
I'm not from Russia, but many of the greatest composers were, such as Tchaikovsky and Rachmaninov.
Oh, I see. Why is Shostakovich your favorite?
His music is very intense, especially his symphonies.
Really? How so?
Shostakovich symphonies push the limits of how powerful and forceful the orchestra can sound.
Really? I never thought of classical music as sounding "intense."
Well, think about some of the big battle scenes in movies and some of the action scenes. That orchestral music gets pretty intense.
That's true. I guess I never really pay attention to the music.
You're not supposed to. It affects people on a more subconscious level.
I suppose you're right. Is Shostakovich a movie composer?
Actually he did write the score to a movie, but he is considered a classical composer because he wrote music to be performed in concert halls by classical musicians.
How does his music compare to say - Beethoven or Tchaikovsky?
Shostakovich is a 20th century composer, so the range of sounds and harmonic dissonances are much more varied than 19th century composers like Beethoven.
I see.
