Do you like Stephanie Mills?
Man, I been learned to respect the power of love.
Okay player, so you know what I'm talking about then.
Yeah. I like that song Home.
Man that's that fire. Did you see her when she did it down in Aruba with Sinbad?
You talking 'bout when Sinbad had that summer concert joint?
Yeah.
Remember after she ripped it Sinbad made them bring her back out on stage?
Yeah. He wanted more. He said bring Stephanie back out here and give us some more of that Home.
I know right. That's when music made you emotional. Made you feel things.
I still like some of the female artists today. I be feeling some of Pink's music.
I like Who Knew.
That thing brings me to tears when I hear it sometimes. You gotta listen to the words to know she's talking about a loss.
Yeah. Pink be making some good ones. She came a long way from Stupid Girl.
Awe man, I forgot all about Stupid Girl. Remember the video?
The video is what made me like the song.
What else did she have that was hot?
She had that You and Your Hand.
Oh that was a headbanger. The bass and drum lines on that thing are fire.
I wish QestLove from The Roots would do a drum beat for Pink. That thing would be hot. You know they both from Philly right?
