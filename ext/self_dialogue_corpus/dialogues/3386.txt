What was your favorite horror movie that came out last year?
Hush. You?
Are you telling me to be quiet?
No, the movie Hush. It's about a home invasion but the woman is a deaf-mute writer and has to survive.
Neat! My favorite was 10 Cloverfield Lane.
How much did that link up with Cloverfield?
I know they said it's in a "shared universe" but there was almost no connection.
Really? None?
Yeah, it seems like the invasion that happens was the same species that fell to earth in Cloverfield.
Seems good but I hate that it's the same "universe" but doesn't work well. Kind of like Prometheus and Alien, right?
