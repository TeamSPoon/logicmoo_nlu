So, what superhero movies are you looking forward to?
Well, definitely Wonder Woman.  I haven't seen that yet, and I hear it's REALLY good.
Yeah, that's what i've heard as well.
And of course, Avengers Infinity War.  I think they've teased us with Thanos quite enough times already.  Be nice to actually see what the guy can do.
Thanos.. that's the dude with the purple skin right?
Yeah, that's him.  Neat little inside tidbit.. remember at the end of the first Avengers movie where Thanos's assistant tells him that to attack the humans would be to "court death"?
Yeah I remember that?
Well, neatly enough, in the comics, Death is an actual character, a female, that Thanos is always trying to win the love of.
Oh, wow, so there's kind of a double meaning in that statement.
Yeah, but it's something only the people familiar with the comics would know about.
