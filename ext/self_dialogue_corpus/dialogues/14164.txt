Did you know Lady Gaga once was the opener for Backstreet Boys?
No, I had no idea, she has come a long way
Yeah, she used to be somewhat normal until she was discovered.
Yeah, she has turned into the new Madonna
Did you see her perform the National Anthem at Super Bowl 50?
Yes, it was great performace, she is very talented.
Yeah, I wish she would focus more on her music then the act, she has an amazing voice
Have you heard her new album?  It is a little more tame than "Born this way"
Yeah, but her sales are way down, makes you wonder how long fame actually lasts.
Agreed, but I still love the new songs, especially "Perfect Illusion".
