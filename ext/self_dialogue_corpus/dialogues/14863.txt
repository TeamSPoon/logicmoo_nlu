Hey! We saw a pretty funny comedy on Saturday.
Cool - what was it?
It was called Masterminds.
And it was good?
Honestly, I wasn't expecting much but I was pleasantly surprised.
Who's in it?
I should have known it would be good when I saw the main actors: Kristen Wiig, Zach Galifianakis, Owen Wilson, Jason Sudeikis.
Wow! Nice line up!
Was it better than Keeping Up With the Joneses?
Yeah, a lot better - it was goofier and the actors could really shine. Kristen Wiig was hilarious, and Zach Galifianakis, of course, was really really funny.
