I'm checking out the highlights from the game.
What happened?
Looks like the Lions won by a landslide.
I like be my Lions.
They are doing great this season.
I've heard!
I'll be attending a home game.
I'll go with!
I know it will be good.
I've never been to a boring Lions game.
Me neither!
They even beat the Wolves last month.
That's thier arch enemy!
I know right?
Was it by a long shot?
No, not by much.
Man, there killing the competition.
Each game, more and more.
I've got faith in my boys!
Roar, the Lions.
