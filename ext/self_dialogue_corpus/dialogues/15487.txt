Hey what do you think of Ariana Grande?
I think she is a bit riske
But don't you feel sorry for her after what happened in London
Oh yes, that was so tragic!
I thought it was great how she organized that concert
Yes, I watched it live from Manchester, I didnt know she had so many friends
I liked how she teamed up with all the artists to sing
She is a very verstile singer
I feel sad that her name will always be associated with this tragedy
I hope that she can put this behind her to focus on what really counts-- the music!
I would like to see a tribute album released by her for the victims
It would be nice if she can put some of her own feeling into her new music
I liked her music to this point-- her music is very uplifting the upbeat
You think her style of music will change?
What do you mean?
Do you think her music will be more mellow, more sobering?
I really like her original style but I think she is also capable of singing something more soulful and aiming to examine the events of manchester
I remember she did a performance-- an Italian song with Andrea Boccelli-- that was really nice
Whatever, she decides to do for her next album I think it will be great
Yes I agree! Ariana Grande is awesome!
