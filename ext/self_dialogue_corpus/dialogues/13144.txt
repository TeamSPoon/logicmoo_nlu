Are you a fan of Return of the Jedi?
Well yes and no!
Why the no?
Ewoks, even if they're soft and cuddly and benign, didn't belong in the movie.
Yeah everyone dumps on the Ewoks.
Plus some of the actors, I'm not saying who, phoned in their performances.
Wow. I'll see if I can spot this next time.
I think that this is the film in the trilogy that fans say they liked the least.
Maybe something about the story.
But at least Luke has a reunion of sorts with family.
