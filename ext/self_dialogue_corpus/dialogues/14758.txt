So hey, what did you do this weekend?
Oh man, I totally had a John Hughes movie weekend.
John Hughes. Didn't he do Christmas Vacation?
Oh yeah! One of Chevy Chase's classic movies.
Wow so you really took it back to the 80s this weekend?
For sure man. Early roles for some big name actors, like John Galecki and Juliette Lewis.
My favorite was Auntie Ruth.
Hahaha, right, with the cat wrapped up like a Christmas present?
Dude, my favorite part is the Uncle. When they're asking her to say grace, and he's like...
The BLESS-ING. hahaha that's great!
