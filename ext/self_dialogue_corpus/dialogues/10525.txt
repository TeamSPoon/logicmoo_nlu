Hi, how are you today?
I am great, even though it's a Monday.
What did you do this weekend?
Not much, but I did go see Guardians of the Galaxy!
You mean the second one?
Yes, it was even more retro feeling than the first.  I loved it!
Was Chris Pratt  as fantastic in this one?
Yes, and there was a Baby Groot in the whole film.  He was adorable.
As adorable as Chris Pratt?
Not quite, but almost.  I think it was a good set up for the next movie as well.
What do you mean?  Guardians of the Galaxy 3?
Yes, either that or a huge tie in to the Avengers.  I'm just waiting for Thor to knock in at some point.
I could handle some Chris Hemsworth in a movie with Chris Pratt.
Yeah, that would be awesome.  You know how they are connected, right?
Not really, except they are all in the same universe or something like that.
There's these things called the Infinity Stones which a big bad guy called Thanos is trying to get.
Oh.  And the pair of Chris's are going to stop him?
Well, the two Chris's and about 70 other people, probably in a movie called Infinity War.
That's the next Avenger's movie?
Yes.  Anyway, go see  Guardians of the Galaxy 2, you'll love it.
