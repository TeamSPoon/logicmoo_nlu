Are you a Beatles fan?
I'm not a die-hard fan, but I do enjoy their music.
I really liked "The Yellow Submarine," both the album and the movie.
The artwork on the album cover is colorful, too. "All You Need is Love," may be my favorite from that album.
My mom told me that they put "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds" on the U.S. 8-track version of that album.
I always thought that "Eleanor Rigby" tells a sad story. Poor thing, no one went to her funeral.
They wrote great stories with their lyrics.
And the music is catchy. "All Together Now" has a child-like quality about it.
I can't believe they broke up so long ago.
That's a testament to how good they were. We still listen to their music.
