What's your favorite movie?
I am not sure, I think maybe Troy.
As for me I don't have a particular favorite.
What are some of your favorites than?
I definitely like horror movies.
What do you like about horror movies?
I like the mystery, intrigue and terrifying unknown.
Wow, you make horror movies sound exciting.
They definitely are, we should watch some horror movies together.
What is the next horror movie you look forward to seeing?
I am looking forward to seeing the new It movie.
Do you think the new It movie will be as good as the old It movie?
I don't know, replacing Tim Curry will be a challenge.
Do you think Tim Curry is the reason why people hate clowns?
Yes I do.
Why is that?
Tim Curry revolutionized the idea of taking an idea meant for humour and turned it to terror.
Wow, I never thought of it that way.
Because of Tim Curry children are often afraid of clowns.
Yes I am terrified of them myself too.
