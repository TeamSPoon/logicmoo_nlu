i wish the beatles had been in a disney song
right! they were supposed to voice the vultures in the jungle book
i wish they had
yeah, either that or they were in a different movie.
i guess it's too late now
unless their heads are frozen like walt disney, yeah
do you really believe that rumor?
i do. i'm just waiting for disney to make a movie about it and confirm
that would be pretty cool, i guess
i need more movies by walt!
