Hey.
Hi.
What have you been up to?
Oh, I've been watching Jim Carrey movies. He's my favorite actor!
Oh, that's unfortunate.
Why is it unfortunate?
He's going to be going to trial soon for providing his ex-girlfriend with a lethal dose of drugs.
Oh. I didn't know that.
And there was also the whole anti-vaccine thing.
The anti-what thing?
You know, when he was Jenny McCarthy's boyfriend. he went along with her whole vaccines cause autism thing.
Well, I didn't know that either.
Still going to watch those movies?
Yeah, but you don't have to go and spoil them for me!
Well, just letting you know.
I didn't really need to know to be honest.
Well, now you do.
He's still my favorite actor.
He shouldn't be.
Go away.
