What was the best pop band of our time?
Still together or no?
Still making music.
I would have to go with Maroon Five.
Sunday Morning was one of their best songs.
Yes, and they are still together.
But Adam Levine has done some solo stuff.
Like, Moves Like Jaggar.
That was a cool song.
Who would you say?
I would go with Fall Out Boy.
I really never thought of them as pop.
I mean, their songs are mainstream popular.
What is your favorite song of theirs?
Centuries.
That is a pretty new one.
They have been out since 2001 and still make good music.
I hope they keep going another twenty year.
I think they will, they said they plan on going as long as they have fans.
I know they are still touring.
