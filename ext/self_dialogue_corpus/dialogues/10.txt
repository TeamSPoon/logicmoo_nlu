Everyone gets bogged down in the Superman versus Batman thing!
Yes, I know. It's overdone.
To me, even more interesting is Batman versus Batman!
What do you mean?
Well, this story has been told over and over. Who did it best?
You mean who's story is best or who did Batman best?
Both! But, feel free to give either one a try.
Okay, the best Batman is definitely in the original television series.
No way! Adam West was so "camp" with it.
I know! That's why I love it.
