Hey! Have you ever seen 'Finding Dory'?
No, I still haven't watched it. Did you like it?
Yes, It's one of my favorite movies- lets watch it sometime together.
Yeah, that would be great!
Ellen Degeneres voices the character Dory, and Ty Burrell voices a beluga whale named Bailey.
Oh, cool. I love Ellen! Did you like this movie as much as Finding Nemo?
I actually liked it a little better than Finding Nemo if you can believe it!
Awesome, now I'm really excited to see it.
Yes, I just loved the story and message about family. Great for adults and children.
Nice, let's plan to watch it this weekend.
