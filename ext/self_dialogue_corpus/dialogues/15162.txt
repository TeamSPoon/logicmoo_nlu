What do you think of Blind Guardian?
I'm not overly familiar with them, which genre are they a part of?
They started out as a power metal band, but over the years they have become more progressive.
Sounds interesting, do you have any albums to recommend?
My favorite album would have to be Imaginations from the Other Side. It's one of their older albums.
Sounds like I should check them out.
They are also an amazing live band, such energy on the stage.
Sounds awesome.
Another band Blind Guardian is similar to would have to be Iced Earth.
What makes them so similar?
The music style and their lyrics are inspired by myths or fantasy.
Could you give any examples of fantasy inspired songs or albums?
Iced Earth actually made an album dedicated to the comic book character Spawn. The album is called The Dark Saga.
Will have to check it out for sure. Considering you say they are so similar have the bands ever worked together?
In a sense they have. John Schaffer and Hansi KÃ¼rch made a band called Demons & Wizards.
Is the band any good?
If you enjoy either Blind Guardian or Iced Earth I think you would like Demons & Wizards.
Has Demons & Wizards released a lot of albums?
Only two as it's just a side project for the two musicians, but there were some rumors that they were working on the third album.
You've given me a few new bands to check out. Thanks for the recommendations.
