What's your favorite Disney movie?
Mine is definitely Beauty and the Beast!  I love that movie!
Oh yeah, that's a great one.  It has a great soundtrack, too.
I know, and all the characters are amazing.  They did a re-make recently but it was nothing like the original.
They never are.  That movie made me cry!
Yeah, it's a tearjerker.  I love Mrs. Pots and the little teacup Chip, too.
Oh yeah, they are precious.  And the candlestick is hilarious.
Yeah, all the characters are truly great in that movie.
I wish Disney was still producing movies like the old classics.
Yeah, me too.  It seems like they don't make them as good as they used to.
