Do you think the Vikings bounce back this year?
Yes I do.
Remember they started out 5-0 last year.
They looked unbeatable.
Yes they did.
Then they went 3-8 after that.
Right down the drain.
Well the first two games can be tough.
Who do they play?
They open at home with the saints.
A tough game.
Then they go to Pittsburgh.
Very tough game.
Then home vs Tampa.
Another tough one.
Then home for division rivals Detroit.
Then week 5 is at Chicago.
They won't start out 5-0 this year
I don't think so either.
Maybe they can go 3-2
