I am trying to figure out how to get into the whole Star Wars movies.
I can help.
Really? You know them and like them.
Like a second nature. How far are you in?
I have only seen Rogue One.
Did you like it?
It was a good movie, but I was kind of lost.
You need to start with the basic films. The ones centered around the Skywalkers.
The ones with Harrison Ford in them?
Yes, to start.
Do I start with his series or the ones with Hayden Chritiansen.
That is always the dilemma. I say start with the Harrison Ford ones.
Which movie do I watch first.
Star Wars, A new Hope.
Is that the first one?
Yes and no.
What does that even mean.
Yes, it is the first one made, but no not the first on the story.
Wow, that is confusing.
Just wait until I explain the sequels.
