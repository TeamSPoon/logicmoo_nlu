Have you seen the movie" Puppet Master"?
No, What is that movie about?
It is about a man who has puppets that come alive.
That sounds like an interesting movie.
I am waiting to see the movie "Friday the 13" the remake.
I did not know there is remake of Friday the 13" movie 2017.
Yes it  looks like it is going to be really good.
I saw "Friday the 13th " part 1,2,3,4,5,6,7.
The first "Friday the 13th came out in the 80's.
I like the movie "Hell Raiser" that came out in the 80's too, and it has 4 parts.
