Who's better, Run-DMC or The Beastie Boys?
It's hard to say.
Why you say that?
Because Run-DMC used to write the songs for The Beastie Boys when they first came out.
For real?
That song Slow and Low? Run-DMC wrote that.
That song was hot. Wasn't it on their first album?
Yeah. It also had Paul Revere on their and some other fire.
Yeah, the rap music from the eighties and nineties is better than what they make today.
I know. I stll be playing Scarface and Kool G rap.
Scarface was that dude. He got extra hot after he left the Ghetto Boys.
Yeah, but The Ghetto Boys still made some bangers.
I think Face was the truth. He made that song with Tupac.
You talking about Smile?
Yeah, that's the one.
I used to like the video for that joint.
Me too. Tupac was that dude.
Man, 'pac was ahead of his time.
I know, if he was still alive he would STILL be on top of the rap game.
I know, right. Between him and Biggie? They had the game sewn up.
