I wish I could watch "I Am Legend" in the theater again.
Why, it wasn't that great.
Did you see it in the movie theater?
No, I rented it online.
It's different when you see it on the big screen.
How so?
Because you get more in to it, it's more 'believable' and you forget where you are...so it's way more intense than on tv.
It wasn't that great to be able to do that.
You would actually be surprised because Will Smith actually did a pretty good job in that movie.
You think so?
When you were actually watching the movie, did you think "This is Will Smith acting like he's walking down this road looking for mutants"?
No.
See, that shows that he did a good job because you forgot it was Will Smith.
Not entirely I didn't.
But you didn't think "Will Smith" the entire time, you thought about what was happening and how he could die, right?
That's true.
Ok, what you saw on tv, imagine that on a huge screen right in front of you, and you're in a dark room, the sound is loud and drowning out everything else.
So that you're fully emerged, I see what you're saying.
Yes, and the intensity at the end had my friend and I sit there in shock for about 10 minutes after the movie was over.
So let's find out how we can see it on the big screen, I'm down for that.
