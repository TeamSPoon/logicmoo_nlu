What did you think of Shutter Island?
I've seen that movie over a hundred times. It's great.
Leonardo Dicaprio did that movie a lot of justice.
Martin Scorsese directed it, too.
I actually didn't know that.
The fact that the lady drowned her kids was so haunting to me.
Yeah and escaped the hospital for the criminally insane.
Yeah, she was a very detailed character.
The way the movie kept a sense of mystery was the best part about it.
It really was. I couldn't look away until I figured out what happened.
