I went to see King Arthur this weekend.
I heard it got mixed reviews.
I left thinking about it for sure.
So what did you think about it?
Well, first off you have to forget everything you know about the original King Arthur stories.
I had heard it wasn't much like them.
I would say the only thing similar is the name King Arthur and Excalliber.
I saw that it had some pretty intense fight secenes.
It did. They were well choreographed but almost seemed forced.
I can't see that.
I did like the music. It was gritty.
I heard some of it during the trailers for the movie.
There really wasn't a love interest but seemed to be like there would a glimmer of one but that never came to be.
I think it was marketed as more action oriented.
The other characters needed to be fleshed out more.
Yes there is a fine line if you don't care about the characters you have nothing vested if they are injured or wronged.
This is what I was thinking but I did leave wondering about the movie.
This is what a good movie will do. It keeps you looking for more.
The graphics were pretty cool too.
It read that it was an expensive movie to make so I can see how the graphics would be amazing.
