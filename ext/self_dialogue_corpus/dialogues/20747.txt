Did you ever get around to seeing Passengers?
No, man. I couldn't figure out what it was about judging by the trailer.
The trailer was just like, "Hey watch Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence in space."
Haha exactly. Although I like both actors, but...
Eh. Jurassic World was awful.
Oh shut up, it was fine. Nothing's going to be the original Jurassic Park.
Did you know Harrison Ford was slated to be the paleontologist?
No way! Why wasn't he?
I think he just bowed out for another project. Sam Neill got hired instead.
Sam Neill was great though. He was incredible in Event Horizon, too.
That film scarred me.
Teddy dying was a disturbing death scene...
I remember getting chills from the corrected latin translation, remember that?
It's not "save me," it's "save yourselves"?
Yes! So freaky. But at any rate - so are you going to at least try seeing Passengers at some point?
Maybe if it comes out on Netflix.`
I think Jurassic World just came out on Netflix.
Not that exciting.
I think Netflix is doing a good job with the documentaries it airs, though.
Well yeah. At least there's that. The movies it's showing, though? Eh.
