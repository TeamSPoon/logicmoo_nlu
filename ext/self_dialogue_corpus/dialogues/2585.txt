This might be the final season we see Larry Fitzgerald and Carson Palmer play together for the Arizona Cardinals.
I hope Carson can last and make it through this season injury free. I know Larry is an ironman.
Do you think they'll retire after the season is over or sign with another team?
I hope they retire with the Arizona Cardinals. I'm oldschool in my thinking of wanting my favorite franchise players to retire with the team that they spent their career with.
It would be fantastic to see Larry retire as a Cardinal. I couldn't imagine him in another team's uniform.
Larry Fitzgerald is the best wide receiver in the Cardinals franchise history.
I can't debate that.
I can see them going out big this season. If healthy, they should be able to take the NFC West.
You don't think the Seahawks will give them a run?
Oh I definitely think the Seahawks will be a big challenge.
I just want to see the Cardinals fully healthy this season.
They had one of the best defenses in the league before injuries took their toll on the team.
Mathieu is going to be back stronger and better than ever. I can't wait to see him knock wide receivers and running backs down across the field.
That defense was so intimidating a few seasons ago.
We'll see it again. This is the year the Cardinals make it back to the Superbowl!
Wouldn't that be great to see.
It would be fantastic. Larry Fitzgerald would go out on top finally winning a Superbowl!
They were so close in one of the best Superbowls I can remember back in Superbowl 43.
That 2008 season was such a memorable season. To come up 27-23, was so heart breaking.
I still have nightmares of that Superbowl loss. This season we make up for it though!
