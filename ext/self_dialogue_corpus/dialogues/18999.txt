Hey How was your weekend?
It was good!
What did you do?
I just chilled at home and listened to some music!
Which music?
I just heard this song by Harry Styles called Sign of the times have you heard it?
No.. I have not
Where did you hear it from?
I heard it from Saturday night live-- he was the musical guest.
Harry Styles? isn't he the guy that used to be in one direction?
Yes yes! Thats him!
I wonder what happened to that band?!
I think they just wanted to break away and do their own thing
Oh ok
He is really good as a solo artist
Let me listen to his new song on youtube
Ok
It definitely have a country flair!
Yep! Thats what I love about it!
Its definitely fresh and new!
