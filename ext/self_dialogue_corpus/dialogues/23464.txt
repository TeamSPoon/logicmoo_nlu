Any word on the next Blade movie?
They're making another one?
That's what I heard a year ago. I haven't heard any news about it since.
Is Wesley Snipes starring in it?
Yeah. He said he had spoke to Marvel Studios about it last year.
I hope Blade 4 is as good as the second movie. I didn't much care for the third one myself.
I thought it was okay. The story was just another rehash of the previous movies.
I know. The bad guys always need Blade's blood for their evil plans.
Don't forget how Whistler ends up dead. I like how Blade was exposed in the last movie, though.
The writers could have expanded on that angle. Maybe SHIELD could have recruited him at the end.
That would have been cool. You know what else is cool?
What?
A crossover between Blade and Underworld.
Or Twilight.
That would definitely make a great movie.
Blade would have those vampires running for their lives. So when's Blade 4 coming out?
I don't know. Marvel hasn't made any official announcements yet.
They're probably busy with all those Avengers movies.
Well, I'm hyped. I'm going to go re-watch all three Blades.
I'll join you when you get to Blade 2.
