The bases are loaded.
I bet the Vipers will win.
It would be so awesome.
Marcus wants to win so badly and ever since he joined this team they haven't done so well.
I know. It's sad.
Oh, my gosh, a home run!
Look at Marcus run!
This game is so amazing. They are going to win. There's only a minute left of the game.
Marcus is going to be thrilled. He just made it home.
This is the best game I've ever seen.
Baseball normally bores me but this was awesome in the end.
I like it OK but you are right about this being one of the best games.
At first I thought the Asteroids would win but the Vipers took it in the end. Can you believe how sudden the turn was?
It was really crazy.
Marcus is coming over here.
Look at that grin.
Oh, he is so happy.
He also looks kind of tired.
Baseball is good exercise like other sports.
Maybe I should play a sport then.
