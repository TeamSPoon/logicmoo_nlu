Who is your favorite catwoman in movies?
I have to go with the beautiful Michelle Pfeiffer.
I am torn between her or julie newmar.both were great as catwoman.
I agree they both were iconic in the role.
I think Pfeiffer  may have a slight edge , in that her performance as serena/catwoman was edgier and maybe even sexier too.
No need to convince me of her merits, I think she is the ultimate catwoman. I loved batman returns in general though.
So you may just be biased to that film?
I still think Pfeiffer deserve top catwoman rank but i am partial to all those actors in the roles. devito is the best as penguin.
I believe he is the only penguin on film.
Well maybe not in the older batman series/ films.. I believe they featured the penguin but i am not sure, I know they had the joker and catwoman.
