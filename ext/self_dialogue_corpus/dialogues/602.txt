Hey! I got two tickets to the big game this weekend. Wanna go?
Yeah, which teams are playing?
Dallas Cowboys and The New England Patriots! This game is gonna be sweet! Cowboys are definitely gonna win.
I doubt that! Watch Tom Brady take this game as usual.
I'm gonna get ready for the big game tonight. The Oakland Raiders against The New York Giants. Hands down on Oakland taking the win tonight.q
Eli Manning has nothing on Derek Carr! His skills just don't match up.
No way, the Giants ALWAYS take home the game! Come over and let's see whose team wins!
Sounds like a plan, I'll be over there by 8.
Oh yeah! Seattle Seahawks against the Pittsburgh Steelers tomorrow night. Who do you think is gonna win?
Are you kidding? That's not even a question, Seattle Seahawks. Have you seen how well Russel Wilson has been playing lately?
Yeah but, Ben Ben Roethlisberger has been throwing down such powerful throws lately. I think Steelers would win.
Well, let's see who wins tomorrow then, shall we?
The game is about to come on! Are you going to watch?
I've been so busy lately, I don't even know which teams are playing tonight.
The Green Bay Packers and the Denver Broncos.
Did you see how well The Green Bay Packers are doing? Aaron Rodgers has such speed.
Yeah, I agree. I think the Broncos might win this one though. Rodgers' speed is no match for Trevor Siemian's skills!
Hey who's playing the game this weekend?
Philadelphia Eagles and San Francisco 49ers. This is going to be such a great game. I'm excited to see how well Carson Wentz improved.
He's gotten better but not as good as Brian Hoyer. Watch the 49ers take this game this time.
