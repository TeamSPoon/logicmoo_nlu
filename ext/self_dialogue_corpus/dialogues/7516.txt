So I had a Harry Potter marathon the other day.
Really? How many did you watch?
I watched all eight, it took all day.
That is crazy, which one is your favorite?
I like the last one, the battle at Hogwarts is just so epic!
I like that one too, so much better than the Deathly Hallows Part 1.
Yes! That one was so boring, all they did was talk and camp.
I almost fell asleep the first time I watched it.
Well, they made up for it with part 2.
Yes, it was such a great movie to end the series.
