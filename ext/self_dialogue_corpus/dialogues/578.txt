How many more Superbowls do you think Brady can win?
I bet he has one more in him.
You think so?
Well, Manning and Elway went out on top. I see Brady doing it too.
Yea, he's the greatest ever.
Better than Montana?
I think so.
Wonder what Drew Bledsoe thinks?
Haha, old Drew never got his job back.
He was a really good QB too.
Yea, but nothing like Brady.
I can't argue with that.
Maybe because his balls were deflated?
Oh that's just wrong.
I know, that deflategate was a waste of money.
I had hoped the team would keep Mallett as a backup.
The guy from Arkansas?
`Yea, I think he had a ton of potential.
I did too.
Can't doubt the coach though.
