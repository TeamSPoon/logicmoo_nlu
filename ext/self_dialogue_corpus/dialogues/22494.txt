Hey, you've seen any good movies lately?
At the theater?
Yeah, something recent.
Well, you know we don't get out to the movies much--mainly Netflix and that sort of thing.
I know what you mean--the comfort of home and not paying 10 bucks for popcorn and a small soda.
Wait, we did see a movie in a theater a while back that I liked.  I can't think of the name.
Well, what was it about?
Some little girl genius.
Oh, Gifted, that was a good movie; we saw it, too.
The little girl was really good.
Yeah, and so was Chris Evans.
I don't even know who that is.
He was the uncle that raised her.
Oh, he was good, too.  My trouble with most movies these days is they are either big comic action things or animated.
Yeah, I don't like those either, although it is amazing what they do with animation now.
And all the big stars do the narration, so when I do see one, I actually usually enjoy it, but I don't seek them out.
Did you consider going to Circle, the new Tom Hanks movie?
Actually I did, but then the reviews weren't that good.
Yeah, I felt the same way, although the subject matter seemed interesting.
I like Hanks, always think of Forrest Gump--talk about dating myself.  Well, catch you later.
