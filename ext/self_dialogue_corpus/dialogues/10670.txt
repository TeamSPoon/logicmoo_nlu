I just watched Fast and Furious.
I've seen that movie. What did you think?
I thought it was good.
Yeah, I really like the interplay between Vin Diesel and Paul Walker.
I do, too. It's funny that they have to work together even though they're enemies.
I know that is really funny, plus the action is really good.
Yeah, it is.  I can't believe Paul Walker is dead now.
I know it's so crazy to think about when you watch the movies.
It is really sad.
I know, I was really sad when he died.
