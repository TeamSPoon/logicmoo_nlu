Who was your favorite Potter charachter?
I'd have to say the Weasley twins.
They were pretty funny.
Too bad they weren't in it more.
True. All the Weasleys were pretty good though.
I like the father a lot.
The mom was kind of annoying.
I thought so too.
Still, I liked Hermione best.
That was a good character.
