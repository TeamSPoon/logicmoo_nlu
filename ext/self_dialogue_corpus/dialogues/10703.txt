Have you seen any of the Fast and Furious movies?
I think I have. I liked them.
Do they seem ok for kids?
No probably not.
Ok. My son likes cars and was asking about these movies.
How did he hear about them?
His friend showed him some of one of the movies.
Oh and now he wants to watch the rest?
Yeah exactly.
Well you could pre-screen the first movie and see what you think.
