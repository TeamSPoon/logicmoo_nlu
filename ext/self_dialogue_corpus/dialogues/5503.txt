Do you know if there are any more Tinkerbell movies coming out?
Not sure. I haven't heard of any new ones coming out.
Yeah the last one was called Tinker Bell and the Legend of the NeverBeast.
That one was pretty good.
I liked it a lot. my favorite though was the Pirate Fairy one.
I loved how they showed a young captain hook in that one.
It was cool. I almost thought he was a good guy until it surprises you.
Yeah it was a cool twist that he was bad all along.
I really do hope they make a new one. I love those movies.
Me too. I always watch them when they come out.
