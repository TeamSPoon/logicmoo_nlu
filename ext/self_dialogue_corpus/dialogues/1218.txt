I am so upset with the transgressions of last years Superbowl.
You are still thinking about that B?
It's been eating me up for months, it was just so unreal that the Falcons lost on such a big lead.
On the bright side the Falcons are the younger squad with a legacy to protect, they will be back.
I agree with you, Devonta Freeeman is still my favorite player right now.
He was incredible for my fantasy league all year too!
He really covered good yards and made solid catches throughout the year for Atlanta.
Falcons have always had a great run squad, and always a great quarterback the land those kill shots.
Someone told me that Matt Ryan just might be the greatest of all time!
That is absolute tomfoolery man, how can he be the best when he gave up a lead like that?
He gave up a lead to a better team, but against Brady his stats and skills match up well.
If we are talking stats we can go far back, my dad still thinks Joe Montana is the best.
Well the game has evolved, and arms nowadays are incomparable.
I completely agree, and Matt Ryan is no chump my man.
He was one of the most entertaining quarterbacks of last year.
He can get those completions, but I was really a Cowboys fan last season.
With Dak Prescott things were looking incredible early in the season.
Yeah but he was a bit young and took on too much.
Maybe it was all thrown at him a bit early but he will surely come back better!
I agree bro, we gotta catch a Cowboy's game some time!
