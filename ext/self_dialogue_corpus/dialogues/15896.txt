Have you seen any good music concerts lately?
I have actually. I recently went to a Beyonce concert.
Wow I bet that was unbelievable.
It really was. This is the third time I have seen her perform her music live.
Third time? I am so jealous. She is such a great performer.
Yeah she is. The second time Jay-Z was a co-headliner at the concert.
That is so awesome. They must have been amazing together.
They were. Do you listen to their music frequently?
I do. I love rap and hip-hop music.
Same. I love their music when they sing/rap on their own and when they are together.
Me too. My favorite song they did together is Crazy in Love.
Mine is On the Run but Crazy In Love is great too!
Did they perform that when you went to see them live?
They did! I sang along the entire time.
I would have too had I been there.
I know every single world to almost all of their songs.
I only know a couple but I still would have loved every minute of seeing them live together.
We should go to their next concert together.
Sounds like a plan just let me know when they perform next!
I will for sure.
