My favorite Star Wars movie was Return of the Jedi, which one is your favorite?
My favorite Star Wars movie was A new hope.
I like when the movies use the old characters-Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, etc.
I find some of the saga hard to follow.
The ewoks in Return of the Jedi are so cute and cuddly.
It was sad when some of the ewoks died.
Jabba the Hutt is funny and gross at the same time.
Princess Leia was not afraid of him at all.
In the new hope, the attack on the empire's death star was very exciting.
Yes, I was on the edge of my seat during that part of the movie.
