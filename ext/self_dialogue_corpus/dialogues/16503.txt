Did you hear Seattle Opera is doing Mozart's Magic Flute?
Oh really, when are they doing it?
Next weekend,  I'm thinking of going to the Saturday showing, do you want to come?
Sure,  but I don't really know much about the opera.
Oh that's okay,  it's really easy to follow,  it's basically a kind of fairy tale with an evil queen and heroic Prince.
Sounds great,  but isn't it in German?
Yes,  but there will be English subtitles so you can follow along.
Nice,  I would really love to hear the orchestra again too.
Oh yes,  they're very good,  and the overture is lovely.
Wait,  what's an overture?
It's basically the introduction to the piece,  it highlights some of the major themes of the opera.
Oh, so is it sung?
Oh no,  it's all the orchestra, it happens at the very beginning.
Awesome, just there's no dancing right?
No,  definitely no ballet scenes in this opera.
Oh good,  I'm really not a big fan of dancing.
Oh really,  why not?
Well when I was younger we went to the Nutcracker ballet every year,  i must have seen that 14 times.
Oh my, that would be boring,  but this should be much more fun,  I promise.
Can't wait then,  I'll buy the ticket today.
