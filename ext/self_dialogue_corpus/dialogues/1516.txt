The football is almost back.
Great, at last!
Our team needs some work.
You think so? I though they were all right.
They won't get in unless they sign somebody.
You can't make the playoffs every year.
Especially when you play Atlanta and Dallas twice.
They do all right at home.
I don't know; did you see that Super Bowl?
Well the New England defense came out soft.
Yeah, but that quarterback has no conscience.
He is good.
We don't play them until week five, so that is something.
I hope Dallas falls off.
Wouldn't bet on it.
With our receivers, we are in any game.
Hey, don't they have to play in Paris this year?
You mean London! I hope not.
At least the game is on at 9 AM.
Kind of too early, don't you think?
