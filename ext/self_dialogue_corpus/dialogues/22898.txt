You're a big fan of the Harry Potter books, aren't you?
Yes, I've read all the books and seen all the movies.
I read a story yesterday about the girl who plays Luna Lovegood. She's in the movie Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix.
Oh, the pretty blonde girl. I forget her name.
It's Evanna Lynch. There was an interesting story about how she was pen pals with J.K Rowling.
Is that how she got the role?
Not exactly. She still had to compete for it in a casting call with thousands of other girls it said.
How did she get to be pen pals with J. K. Rowling?
She wrote to her saying how Harry Potter was the only thing that kept her mind off her problems.
What problems did she have?
She was in the hospital when she wrote to her. She had an eating disorder.
That was really nice of Rowling to become her pen pal.
She's an ambassador now at a chairty for children Rowling started
What's the charity called?
Lumos. It helps children in institutions and orphanages.
That's really great that Rowling is helping so many children with a charity organization.
Her books have helped many children. Evanna said Luna helped her because she always felt odd and weird, and Luna made her see that as empowering.
What a great story!
I know. I thought it was great that now Evanna has a role in helping others.
By helping someone, you can empower that person to help others, which spreads your help.
