Can you see Lady Gaga doing more than she already has?
In what terms?
Like her Super Bowl performance was probably her best ever, right?
Sure it was great but she can do more.
And then she did a duo with Tony Bennet!
She is showing her diversity.
I think she is such a great entertainer.
I believe she is this generation's Madonna
Except shes not outspoken.
No but she takes hardline stances on many things.
