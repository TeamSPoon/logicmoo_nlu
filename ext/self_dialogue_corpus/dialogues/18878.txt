Who is your absolute favorite music artist?
That is a hard question... probably Shania Twain.
Shania is the best! Did you know she is on tour right now?
No way! I thought she only played in Vegas now.
Nope, she has a summer tour going on right now.
I will have to check that out! She is the best.
She really is. I miss country music from the 1990s and early 2000s.
So do I. Country music has really gone down hill in the past five years or so.
So I assume you aren't a big Florida Georgia line fan?
Definitely not. Their music is not actually country!
Fair enough. Have you heard their new song God, Your Mama, and Me?
I haven't. Tell me about it.
Its from their Dig Your Roots album. It features the Backstreet Boys.
Oh, I do love the Backstreet Boys! I don't know how I feel about them teaming up with Florida Georgia Line though.
You should check it out. Have you heard the new Brad Paisley song Last Time For Everything?
I have! Brad Paisley is awesome.
My first concert was his summer tour in 2010.
Oh I bet it was great. I've heard he is fantastic live.
He definitely is. The opener was Darius Rucker, another great singer.
I love Darius! He is very underrated in country music.
