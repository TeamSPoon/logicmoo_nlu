Have you heard the new Incubus album?
I haven't. Is it any good?
It's okay, but their old stuff will always be king.
Their old stuff is amazing.
I re-listened to some of their older stuff the other stuff. Brought me back.
Like songs off the Science record?
Yes! Such an amazing record.
That music was way ahead of it's time.
I wish they would go to back to that style.
I do as well.
