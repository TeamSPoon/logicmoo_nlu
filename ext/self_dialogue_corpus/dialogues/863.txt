Do you like football?
Yes I do.
Who is your favorite team?
The Cleveland Browns.
That is my favorite team too.
Great, how do you think they will do this year.
They will stink as usual.
Yeah pretty much how I feel too.
Do you go to many games?
I have season tickets.
I do too.
I sit in the dawg pound.
That's the best place to sit.
Yeah only the die hard fans are there.
It's to bad they are bad every year.
I just wish we could find a quarterback.
I hope this years draft class actually works out.
Yeah that would be a change.
It was good talking to you.
Go Browns!
