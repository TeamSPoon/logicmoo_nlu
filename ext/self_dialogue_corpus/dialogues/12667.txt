Why do you think that the Star Wars movies were such a success?
I think that it was the mythos that Lucas created: sword and sorcery among the stars -- it was a mash-up of old Hollywood tropes.
I could see that.  The Force -- everyone imagined how that might be useful: mysterious, powerful and ubiquitous.
Also, there was a slowly unfolding story beneath the movies, as they went along: Luke finds his history *and* his destiny!
I know -- *everyone* was shocked along with Luke when Darth Vader said "Luke -- I am your father!" in The Empire Strikes Back!
And then -- with the second trio of movies -- we came to find out that this was all *really* Anakin Skywalker's story.
But now there's a deeper mystery -- we now know who Kylo Ren's parents were -- but what of Rey? How does she fit in?
And, of course, in every movie, we find out a little more about the Jedi and the Sith and -- of course -- the mysterious Force!
It's amazing that George Lucas has managed to create this entire mythos -- this entire Universe! -- and we just can't get enough of it.
I can't wait to see what surprising twist that The Last Jedi has in mind for us!
