Hey what are some of the best movies that you have seen this year?
I have a few that were really memorable for me actually.
Well name a few of them.
Logan, Get Out, and Split were all my favorite so far.
Do you have one out of those that was the clear cut winner.
I would have to say Split, the entire movie was excellent.
I thought that was M Night Shyamalan's best movie in a while.
I agree, he completely redeemed himself from his last few movies.
The only problem that I had with the movie were the two girls other than the main one.
What was wrong with them.
I just thought the acting was cheesy, and their characters were rather undeveloped.
I can see your point, the characters really were not that believable.
For sure, I really did not care when they died in the end.
I thought the guy who played the main character was fantastic though.
Yeah he had some of the best acting that i have seen in a long time actually.
I think that he might win an oscar for that performance.
It is a little early to be able to tell, but I think you may be right.
The way he was able to switch between each personality was outstanding.
He is an super underrated actor for sure.
Hopefully this movie will give him more recognition.
