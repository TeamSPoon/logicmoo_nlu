Ringo is my favorite Beatle. George is second.
I like their solo stuff but not so much Johns or Paul's.
It's funny how John and Paul seem to be favored more, though.
I know. They are popular.
I even liked Ringo as the conductor on Shining Time Station.
What's that?
A TV show for kids.
Ah. I never heard of it but if he's in it I'd like it.
We can find epesodes on Youtube.
My favorite Beatles song is 'A Little Help from my Friends' which Ringo sings lead on.
