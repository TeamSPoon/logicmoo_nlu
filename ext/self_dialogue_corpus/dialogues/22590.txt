Did you see the new Wonder Woman movie?
Not yet, what did you think of it?
Oh my gosh, it was awesome. I love the story behind her.
So it told you how she came to be?
Yeah, that was one of my favorite parts of the movie since I never knew how she came to be.
Did you go see it with anyone?
Yeah, my husband went with me. He like it as well.
Did they talk at all about her being in the Batman v. Superman movie? Was it tied in somehow?
That was the opening scenes.
Really?
Yeah, Bruce Wayne sent her the original copy of her photo in the movie.
So, the rest of the movie was about her past?
Pretty much. It also showed how she fell in love at one point.
Really? What happened to him?
I don't want to give away too much of the movie.
I know, I will have to go see it for myself.
I would definitely recommend it.
I can't wait!
I can't wait until they come out with the new Justice League Movie.
Me too. I will have to see Wonder Woman before that one comes out.
