What do you think of the neighborhood?
I've never heard of them. Are they a band?
Yes, they're an indie/alternative group.
Oh that's cool. I'm into indie music, which songs would you recommend?
My personal favorites are "west coast" and "sweater weather".
I've actually heard of sweater weather a lot.
It's their most popular song, everybody loves it.
Ya I've listened to it before. It's a really good song and very relaxing too.
I love the neighborhood. My favorite person in the band would have to be Jesse, the lead singer.
What's his last name?
his name is Jesse Rutherford and he always has crazy black and white hair.
Why does he do that?
The band focuses their music and album covers around the colors black and white.
That's so interesting, I've never heard a band that does that.
Ya it's pretty cool, it makes them stand out from everybody else.
I'll make sure to give them a listen.
That's great I hope you love it.
Do you have any other song recommendations?
I also love "W.D.Y.W.F.M" and I really recommend their I love you album.
Ok thanks so much!
