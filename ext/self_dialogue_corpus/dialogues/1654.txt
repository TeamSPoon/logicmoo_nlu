Hey are we going out tonight? Trivia perhaps?
That sounds good. They have a NFL trivia night at one of our local hangouts.
Oh yeah we could give them a run for their prizes and cash!
Let's practice a little with a few fun ones you have stashed.
Who used to stuff his shoes with tootsie rolls in socks because he said it made him run fast?
That would be Darrell Green, one of the fastest men in the history of the NFL
Nice! NFL moved the Superbowl XXVII from Arizona to California in protest of Arizonaâ€™s refusal to celebrate Martin Luther King Day
That's not right.Why in the world would Arizona do that and risk the revenue loss and upset fans for disrespecting MLK.
What does Steve Smith of the Ravens do after every game?
Oh I know this one. He leaves his  cleats on the field to raise awareness about homeless people without shoes
Here's an overachiever for you. here was a Supreme Court Justice, Byron White who was also an NFL player (3x all-pro). In addition to that he was also an WWII vet (2 bronze star medals), a Rhodes Scholar, and a member of the College Football Hall of Fame
Who did he play with?
Detroit Lions and I think first he played with the Pirates. I will have to check that one for sure.
Hey I have one for you. What happens if a NFL player gives a fan the game ball?
They are fined $5000.
Heck that's chump change for most of those players.
How long do you think an actual NFL game is in regular time?
I know that a lot of other stuff goes on but I am guessing 1 hour maybe.
This will blow your mind. A Football Match Lasts Only About 11 Minutes!
No way! What a rip off!
