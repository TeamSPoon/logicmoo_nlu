How did you like how they reintroduced old characters in The Force Awakens?
It was great, especially that they had so many of the original cast involved.
We got to see how some of the characters had evolved, in particular Han and Leia.
For me it was really most interesting how they were indicating that Luke was really important.
Too bad we only got to see him at the end of the movie, I hope they have a grand story arc planned.
I guess, only time will tell.
How did you enjoy Kylo Ren as a villain?
He just came off as a pawn in the grand scheme of things.
Indeed, I really hope they will add some more depth into the villain in the upcoming movie.
There was so much opportunity wasted with how they portrayed the villains.
