Have you seen the new John Wick movie?
No, I haven't.
I heard it was very good.
How so?
I heard it was action packed and fun to watch?
Are you planning on seeing it?
Yes.
Where do you  go to see movies?
I usually watch from home.
So do I.
Are you going to see it?
Sure, although I haven't seen the first one.
You should watch it first.
Will not watching the first movie impact the second movie?
No, I just think that it was very fun to watch.
Any other movies you think I should watch?
Sure, how about wonder woman?
No way.
What?
It's too unrealistic.
