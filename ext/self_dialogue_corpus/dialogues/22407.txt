Do you know how many Fast and The Furious movies there are?
Are you including the one that just came out?
Yeah, I thought there was only 6?
No, there are  8 of those movies.
Does Tokyo Drift really count though?
Well, yeah. Its still in the franchise.
I guess so, Vin Diesel did show up at the end.
I heard that Tokyo Drift, was kind of supposed to be like a new generation of it.
What? Kind of like Star Wars, that one was out of order?
Thats what I heard, I dont know if there is much truth to it.
That would be really weird, but that movie didnt play into the storyline, so maybe.
Thats how I feel to, it doesnt make much sense.
Have you seen the latest one though?
I have, I watched it when it first came out.
How bizarre was it, Dom had a kid!
I know, I read a meme that said he had died tried to save his kid.
Me too, and when I saw him with a kid, I was so upset.
Right? Im so happy he didnt though.
Me too, cant wait for the next one coming up.
Me either, we should go together when it comes out.
