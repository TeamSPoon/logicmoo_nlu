Did you catch the new DC movie yet?
Which one?
The Wonder Woman movie.
No, I have not. Did you see it?
I did.
Was it good?
It was full of action. A really face paced show.
Was it not just like Captain America?
Not really. It was set mostly in WW1.
Really? I did not know DC would want a movie then.
Yeah, it is a really great back story. The plot is super complex but easy to follow.
Did it fit in with other DC movies?
The recent ones for sure.
Was it kind of like Batman Vs. Superman?
Not exactly. It was, kind of but more action and less moody stuff about their family.
I really want to see it. I liked her in the last film, the last Batman.
She does a great job in this film. Lots of strong women in the movie.
I love when they have strong women in movies. Do you think the new Justice League will have wonder woman, the movie?
I am sure it will. That movie will have every one in it.
I really want to see it.
