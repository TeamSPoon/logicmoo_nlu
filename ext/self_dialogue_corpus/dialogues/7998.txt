Do you like Cher?
She is a singer, right?
Yes, she isn't as popular now, but she used to be on the radio all of the time!
What are a few of her famous songs?
She released songs called Believe & If I Could Turn Back Time
I've heard of those!
She is pretty old at this point. But I think she is still making music.
How old is she now?
She is 71 years old.
That is incredible. I hope that she finds some more success, even in her old age.
