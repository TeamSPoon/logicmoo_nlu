Have you seen the movie About Time?
I think so, is that the one where the guy and his father can travel back in time?
Yes, it's got Rachel McAdams in it.
Yeah, I've seen it.  Good movie.
Yes, it's actually one of my favorites.
Yeah, I love the two British guys in it, Domhnall Gleeson and Bill Nighy.
Yeah, they are good.  I've seen them in some other stuff too.
Did you you know Rachel McAdams has actually starred in three movies about time travel?
I've heard that!  But she's never actually gotten to time travel in any of the films!
Haha, bad break!  I like her a lot.
Yeah, me too.  She's great in The Notebook.
Yes, I love that movie, it's one of my favorites.
Definitely, there was some real chemistry between her and Ryan Gosling.
Yeah, it's no wonder they dated in real life afterwards.
Yeah.  What other Rachel McAdam movies do you like?
I just recently saw Spotlight, have you seen that one.
Yes, that's the one about the Boston Globe feature of the Catholic Church.
Yes, based on a true story.
Yeah, that one stuck with me.  Interesting story but some sad truths uncovered there.
Yeah, it's an amazing story though.
