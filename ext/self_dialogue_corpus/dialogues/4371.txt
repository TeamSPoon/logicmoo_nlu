So, have you seen any thriller movies lately?
Not lately, but I really liked Taking Lives with Angelina Jolie and Ethan Hawke.
Yeah, that was a good one as I remember.
It had a complex plot and everything.  I remember I screamed when Angelina Jolie laid down on his bed and he grabbed at her from beneath and his arms went around her.
Yeah, that was creepy...
And it didn't even fit into the plot that much!  I mean, what did that have to do with anything?  It was just from out of nowhere.
Yeah, it's like they did it just to startle you.
Yeah, it was funny how I screamed and everything.
Did you see it with anyone else?
Yes, my parents went to see it, but my stepfather left near the beginning, when he killed that first guy.
