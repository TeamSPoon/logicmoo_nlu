What song are you listening to?
Oh, that's 'Chandelier.'
I used to always hear this on my commute.  Who is it?
It's Sia.
Oh that's right, her name sounds familiar.  As does her voice.
She's the best. She's done a lot in her career.
Did she do 'Cheap Thrills?'
Yea she did!
Okay, I knew I heard that voice elsewhere.  She's so talented.
She really is.  She's only going to get bigger.
What are some other songs?
'Soon We'll Be Found,' 'The Greatest,' 'Alive,' among a few.
I'll have to check them out.
You should.  She also writes for a lot of different artists as well.
Like who?
She's written for Rihanna, Beyonce, and a bunch of others.
Wait, did she do 'Diamonds?'
Yup.  It has her sound.
That's really cool.  I'll check out more of her music in the future.
I can link you to a playlist on Spotify.
