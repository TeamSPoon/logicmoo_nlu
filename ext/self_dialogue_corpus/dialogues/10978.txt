Do you know who the Devils are playing tonight?
I am not sure, why?
Tonight is one of the playoffs for the Stanley Cup.
Good Old Lord Stanley's Cup, eh? That's going on now?
Yeah, playoff season usually start around the start of May.
When does the season start then?
Some time in October I think.
Wow that certainly is a long season!
It kind of is. The whole thing could be wrapped up in 6 months if they tried.
Six months still feels a little long for a sports season. It should be around four.
Hockey is a different sport though. The players need more spaced out games.
Football players can do it, why can't hockey players?
There's more players in football and hockey players take harder collisions.
I guess I never thought of it that way.
It really is a sport that has to be played to be respected.
I suppose that is true in some way.
Maybe you should play a hockey game with my rec league some time?
Well I never really skated but I'd love to give it a try.
Maybe by next playoff season you'll be skating like a pro.
Well I certainly have all the time in the world then. Haha!
