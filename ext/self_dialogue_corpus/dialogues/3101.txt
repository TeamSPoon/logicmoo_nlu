Smallwood is going make a difference this year for the Eagles.
He is definitely I would agree.
He is confident and learned a lot this year.
Spring training has helped prepare the Eagles for a tough season.
I think they could go all the way.
I hope they do.
What year did the Eagles last make the Super Bowl?
They were there in 2005.
Wow, that's a long time ago.
They only made it twice to the Super Bowl.
I still think this is their year.
What makes a team able to get to the Super Bowl?
I think determination.
They have to have a lot of skill and talent as well.
It only takes one great year.
That's true, it could happen this year.
What team made the Super Bowl the most?
The Patriots and Steelers have made it a lot.
They do tend to seem to be winners a lot.
I'm excited for the season.
