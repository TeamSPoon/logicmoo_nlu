I just saw highlights from Superbowl XI.
Which one was that?
Oakland Raiders over the Minnesota Vikings.
The Vikings?  I heard they never won.
This was their fourth appearance.
Who quarterbacked?
Fran Tarkenton for the Vikings and Kenny Stabler for the Raiders.
Who scored first?
No score in the first quarter, but the Raiders scored 16 in the second.
What was the score at halftime?
16-0, Raiders.
Who was in the halftime show?
The New Mickey Mouse Club.
That was lame.
Oakland scored a field goal in third, while Minnesota scored a touchdown.
So it was 19-7?
Yes.  The Raiders scored two touchdowns to make it 32-7.
Not 33?
There was a missed PAT.  Minnesota scored again but it was too late.
The Vikings had not luck in the Superbowl.
