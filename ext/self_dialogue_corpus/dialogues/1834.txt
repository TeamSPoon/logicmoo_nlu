Who do you think is going to win the Superbowl this year?
Hmm.. that's a really tough choice.
Is it really?
I guess not. I'm taking Pittsburgh.
Because they're good or because you love Big Ben.
Can it be both?
I guess so. I think it's the Cowboy's year.
You say that every year.
Yeah I know, but I really mean it this year.
That's what you said last year.
Last year was just a warm up.
It was a good run.
And this year is going to be even better.
How so?
The cowboy's are going to be undefeated Superbowl champs.
Do you want to bet on it?
Sure! how much?
How about $200?
Can we bet $20 instead?
I guess you're not that confident.
