I watched National Treasure the other night.
Why?
My daughter never saw the movie. It's pretty good.
Weird that Nick Cage is in it.
He's a goofy actor. It was sort of an action type movie.
Yes, I guess so.
Well maybe more of an adventure.
Thats pretty old isn't it?
Yes from 2004 I think.
Well considering Disney did it, I guess it couldn't have been boring for her.
