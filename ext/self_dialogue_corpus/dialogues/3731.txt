What was your favorite thriller movie?
I liked Silence of the Lambs.
That was a pretty good, Anthony Hopkins was amazing as Hannibal Lecter.
Yeah he was.  One of the best movie bad guy of all time.
I love his epic escape too.  That was awesome when he took that face off.
Yeah, he had everyone fooled.
Jody Foster was amazing as well.
Yeah, she won an Oscar for that film.
Didn't they sweep the Oscars that year?
Yes they did.  All five, best picture, best actor, best actress, best screenplay, best director.
