So rock is pretty old, I know--my dad used to go on about itâ€”but I feel confused about how the genre really started?
Yeah me too, but I took a couple classes on American Popular Music in college and that really cleared some things up.
So what did you learn?
Well, I think a lot of it has to do with marketing categories, how the industry sold music to consumers. Which surprised me.
Whoa, I didn't realize the music business was so commercial back in the day.
Yeah, it's super ridiculous when people talk about music being commercial today....It's ALWAYS been commercial in American Popular Music this century.
So what were some of these marketing categories? That influenced rock music?
The way I understand it, rock kind of emerged as a confluence between Rhythm & Blues and Country& Western.
Well, that kind of makes sense.
But I was even more fascinated to learn that those categories don't divide up as neatly along racial lines as some of the pop culture stories (especially about Elvis) might make you think!
