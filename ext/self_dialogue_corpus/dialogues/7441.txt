Do you remember A Goofy Movie?
Yes, I still watch it sometimes.
I felt bad for Goofy in it, but sometimes he embarrassed Max a lot.
I know. He didn't mean any harm, though.
Powerline made some really good music.
Definitely! That song "I2I" is still good.
Max's performance as Powerline was probably worth getting in trouble for.
Remember when his friend made the leaning tower of "cheeze-a?" It always looked so good.
Animated canned spray cheese, a true delicacy.
It's better than getting chased by Bigfoot like they do in the movie!
