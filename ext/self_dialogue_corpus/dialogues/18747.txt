Do you like the Beatles?
Yeah, they were one of the best bands ever.
They were pretty good.  Imagine from John Lennon was great.
I know, and even today, everyone knows.  John Paul George and Ringo.
So many classic songs.
Like come together.
Or Let it Be.
That's one of my favorites.
Even today it has this magical and relaxing sound to it.
They just don't make music like that anymore.
It would have been pretty cool to have gone to one of their concerts.
With all those screaming girls?  I don't think so.
I forgot about that.
Yeah I could do without the screaming.
They still scream today.
And I still don't like it.
Me either.
You know what was a fun Beatles song?
When I'm 64.
How'd you know?  That's a top one for me.
