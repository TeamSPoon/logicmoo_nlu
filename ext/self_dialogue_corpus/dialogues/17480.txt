Hmmm, this band started up recently, around the mid 2000s.
Yeah, honestly, there are better bands than these amateurs.
Dude, respect these guys! Don't let your ego get to you!
Hey, they're nothing compared to Coldplay, Earth, Wind & Fire, or The Rolling Stones
Well, apparently no one likes Alternative Indie-Pop that much.
I like rap and hip-hop so much more.
I mean, this genre was created during the 70s, and it was only popular in the UK back then.
Well, us Americans ain't gonna listen much to that crap load of music.
Hey, everyone's just trying to make their own music with a little bit of their own style.
What do you mean?
Sure, the new modern world has all of these pop singers, rap artists, and singing legends, but you have to appreciate the music that came before,
Like what?
Mozart, Beethoven, Bach, the classical and opera concerts, the Renaissance is where music really started for Europe.
Okay, I get it, I'll won't do it again.
Seems like you had a change of heart for music now.
I don't like small bands, but I do know my history.
What about your girlfriend? Does she like this music?
Not really, she's more into fur fashion.
Really? Maybe, she'll like some 1920s music.
Nahhh, she's like a hardcore woman who's against PETA. She'll fully defend herself in all of her furs, if possible. Like make a fur coat of all the furs that have been made in the world, like an Intarsia fur coat.
