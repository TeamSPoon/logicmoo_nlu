I think I want to dress up as one of the Disney Princesses for Halloween.
Which one?
I'm not sure, yet.
Well, which one's your favorite?
I can't just go with that! I want to make sure it's one I actually look like.
It doesn't matter, you can make your own version! People are always putting their own spin on things, "steampunk" this and "modern" that.
I guess I could, but I'm really not that good at sewing or costuming or whatever.
I'll help you. We can work on our costumes together and ours will be the best.
You think we could use them to enter the contest? I don't know about getting up on stage.
We'll do it together, trust me. I'll make mine go with yours and we'll go up there as a team.
