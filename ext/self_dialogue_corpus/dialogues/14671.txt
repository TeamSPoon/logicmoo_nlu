Which team did Larry Bird play for?
He played for the Boston Celtics.
Is he in the hall of fame?
He certainly is, and his number was retired by the Celtics.
What position did he play during his career?
He was a forward.
I saw that he won some championships in his career.
Yes, 3 times in fact, and he was the most valuable player in two finals series.
Did he every play in the olympics?
Yes, in 1992, along with other great basketball players at the time.
I saw Paul Pierce play for the Celtics, and seemed to be as good as you described Larry Bird to be.
Pierce won a championship and finals MVP when he played for the Celtics.
Did he play with Larry Bird?
No. Bird retired several years before Pierce was ever drafted.
I'm sure I saw Paul Pierce play for other teams also.
Yes, later on in his career, he played for the Brooklyn Nets, Washington Wizards, and finally, the L.A. Clippers.
I remember that Pierce played the forward position in his career, just like Bird.
He sure did, and he is regarded as one of the best Celtics to ever play.
I think he should be in the hall of fame in the future.
I agree, and I'm pretty sure the Celtics will retire his number.
