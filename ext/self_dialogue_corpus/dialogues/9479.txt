Want to know a place that has way more great rappers than you'd expect?
Sure, what's this place?
Long Island, New York.
No way. Long Island is all upper class suburbs isn't it?
Not exactly. Either way, some great rappers are from there?
Who?
Public Enemy, Rakim, MF Doom, KMD, Busta Rhymes, Aesop Rock, and Prodigy to name a few.
Wow, those are some of the most critically acclaimed rappers of all time. Is there an area where most of them come from?
Not exactly, but two towns that border on each other, Hempstead and Uniondale are home to Public Enemy and Busta Rhymes among others.
I guess I need to expand my definition of what New York rap is, i thought it was only the five boroughs. Like Nas from Queens, Wu-Tang from Staten Island, and B.I.G. from Brooklyn.
