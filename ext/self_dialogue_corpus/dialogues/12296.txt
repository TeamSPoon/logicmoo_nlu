Do you think the new Star Wars hold up to the older ones.
I mean, you can not remake the feel of a New Hope.
But, their world has a new feel now.
Right, but still they are not as good.
How do you think they hold up to the prequels?
I would put the Force Awakens on par with episode two.
I think it has a similar feel.
Yes, the hand to hand combat.
I liked that the storm troopers got more of a back story in both.
I loved Finn's story.
