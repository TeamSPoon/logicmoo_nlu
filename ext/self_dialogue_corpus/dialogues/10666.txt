Who is your favorite Fast and Furious character?
I like The Rock, he's great.
Oh you mean his character Luke Dobbs. Yeah he's funny.
He was so funny in Furious 7.
Yeah when he jumped a ambulance of a bridge onto a plan? That was insane.
I liked when he flexed so hard it ripped of the cast on his arm.
That or when he picked up the gun and said, "I am the cavalry."
Yeah, he's great. Did you see him in Fast 8?
Yeah he was good in that too.
Yes, he's a good addition to the series indeed.
