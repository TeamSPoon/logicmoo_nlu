I've been listening to a new rock music station. They play all of the greats.
Like who?
They play Def Leppard, Lover Boy, Foreigner, and ZZ Top among others.
I love Def Leppard!  I don't hear enough of them on the radio these days.
I know!  My favorite song of their's is Rock of Ages.
Mine is Too Late.  Do you like Bon Jovi?
I do!  I love Wanted Dead or Alive!
Oh me too!  I especially love Livin' on a Prayer!
Definitely!  That song is like the story of my life!
Mine too!  They really scored when they wrote it!
