What is your favorite song from Bruno Mars?
I love Nothin' On You.
I forgot about that song.
What is yours?
Uptown Funk.
I for got about that one.
How could you. They played it constantly.
True.
Locked Out of Heaven was also good.
He had a lot of good ones.
I was thinking of taking my daughter to his concert.
Just the two of you?
Don't think my husband would want to go.
No, probably not.
Tickets sell out so fast.
Yeah, and so expensive on StubHub.
Maybe the next time he tours.
Will you take a friend of hers too?
Depends how much the tickets are.
Well, she would be happy just to see him.
