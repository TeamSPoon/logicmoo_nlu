I rewatched Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone last night.
Is that your favorite movie from the series?
It does tend to be the one that I end up rewatching more often than not. I think it's my favorite simply because of nostalgia - plus, it reminds me how much I love Neville Longbottom.
Oh yeah, he's one of my favorite characters too! I love Luna Lovegood too.
Which is your favorite movie?
It has to be tied between Sorcerer's Stone and Order of the Phoenix.
What's your favorite part about Order of the Phoenix? I really like that you get to see Harry with Sirius more, as sad as it ends up being by the end.
I like that there's a little bit more action and things start to get more intense. And Tonks, I wish we got to see more of her.
Yeah, I could enjoy a whole movie of just Tonks' story. I did like her more in the books but I think the actress was a good pick.
Same here, her backstory has to be so interesting. And I love that scene where she's making Ginny and Hermione laugh by changing her face.
