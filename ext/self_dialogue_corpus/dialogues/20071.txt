Hey, did you see Guardians of the Galaxy 2 yet?
Yeah, I saw it last weekend with my sister!
Cool! What'd you think?
I thought it was even better than the first one!
Really?
Yeah, I think the characters were more rounded in this one.
I dunno, I thought the first one was funnier for sure.
I mean, the first one had its moment, but this one had baby Groot.
Okay yes, baby Groot was super cute!
And funny!
Remember that part when he dragged a desk out?
And Rocket was like, "I told you 'this' big!"
Haha, yeah, it was super funny.
Did you remember to watch the end credit scenes?
As in plural?
Yeah, there were like four credit scenes in this one.
Oh shoot, what where they about?
Well, one of them featured a teenage Groot.
Oh that sounds hilarious!
Well, I guess that means you gotta go again!
