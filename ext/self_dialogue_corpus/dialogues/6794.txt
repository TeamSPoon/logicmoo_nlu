Have you seen Aladdin?
Yes, I loved it when I was younger.
Ya I could practically quote the movie. The score is so good too.
I love the opening market song when aladdin is running away from the guards after stealing bread.
That is a good one. I love the genie and friend like me.
Robbins Williams was great in that role.
His voices and personality really made that role what it was.
Agreed without him as genie it would not have been the same movie at all.
Probably would not have been nearly as successful either.
I actually cried at the end when genie leaves. I know it is happy ending but I always get teary.
