Do you listen to Kanye West a lot?
I really can't stand him.
Don't you think that he is talented?
He definately is talented, but he wastes a lot of his talent on being arrogent and annoying.  That does appeal to some though.
He's just rapping about what he is passionate about.
Well, I could understand if it was that, but his music is too much in the background.
What do you mean?
Make your message sound good.  Don't just have a message and say it over and over with no musical integrity.
I guess you have your opinion.
That's how I feel when I hear him.
