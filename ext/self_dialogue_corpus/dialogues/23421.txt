Did you ever see Bad Words?
No. What's that.
It's a movie with Jason Bateman.
He's really good!
I agree. You'd like it.
What's it about.
This guy enters a spelling bee.
That sounds lame.
No, it's great.
Why would a grown man enter a spelling bee?
I can't really say without giving up the end.
Oh...
Trust me, it's worth your time. It's Bateman like you've never seen.
How so?
He's kind of a bad guy.
A bad guy?!
More of an anti-hero.
He always plays the nice guy.
I know. That's why it's so great!
I'll have to check it out.
