Have you seen any good movies lately?
Yes a bunch. Which genre are you most into? Horror, drama, comedy?
I love thrillers and comedies.
I recently saw this lesser known movie called Colossal. Anne Hathaway is in it. Pretty funny and original.
Cool, I like her. She was great in Les miserables.
Ya. Interesting fact her mother performed that same role prior.
I had heard that. Pretty neat. Any other suggestions for recent films..a thriller?
I saw the movie Split recently. I really enjoyed it but my friend did not. But worth checking out.
I think I saw the trailer looks decent.
What about your recommendations, got any?
A lot any specifics?
Maybe an action film?
I would suggest Ghost in the shell.
I already saw it, did enjoy it. Any others?
Well my new all time favorite is the Mad Max Fury Road.
That is a great film, talk about action packed!
I don't know too many more great action films, maybe drive if you have not seen that.
I also love Drive, but thanks for suggestions anyways.
Sorry could not help more. Maybe check list on the internet for great action films.
That is smart so many films listed  to discover.
