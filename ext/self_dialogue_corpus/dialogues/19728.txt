Listen to this good music.
Head Over Heels by Tears for Fears? Such a good song.
Even as a kid I liked this song. I'm 52 now, funny how time flies﻿.
Same here, I'm 40 now and I like this song as much as I did as a kid.﻿
We had the best music. I don't know what's up with this music now a days
The best music came out in our childhood in many genres.
Just about everything from the 80s was awesome music, movies, TV, toys, everything except clothing style.
Yeah, they can keep the clothing but you are right.
It's a great song and I love the music video. Its just something that goes hand in hand with the experience all those years ago.﻿
I remember this song when it first came out in 1985, I was 21 and it feels like it was yesterday!
It's really not funny how time flies.. and I mean that in the nicest possible way.
Seems like the 80's was a good time to be alive.﻿
I definitely took them for granted﻿.
It was and life will never be the same again.
Yes it was. Just a little too much partying.
Partying and listening to "Head Over Heels."
I think the 80's was best decade for music EVER!!  Hands down.﻿
I agree it was. The world was still a nice place to be back then.
We had so much fun listening to this song back then.
I wish I could go back to the 80's.
