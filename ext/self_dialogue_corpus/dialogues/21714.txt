Have you seen any Ron Howard films lately?
I seen the one called Inferno.
With Tom Hanks?
Yes, have you seen it.
I did, it was pretty much like the last Davinci code movies.
I do not think it was meant to be.
He makes a variety of films, I think all his stuff is really good.
Did you hear he is the new director for the Han Solo film?
The guy from Star Wars? Thought he died in the last one.
He did, it is a prequel.
Another Star Wars Prequel?
No, just about Han Solo and his life.
Do you think Ron Howard will do him justice.
He has a few sort of Sci-fi type movies.
Like what?
He directed Cacoon.
The old people movie with the aliens?
Yes, and he also did Willow.
I did not know he did that one.
It is one of the best Fantasy films of all time.
