They are very hard and they are really serious about their music.
What other bands would you compare them to?
Well, like I said, they are unique, but I they went on tour they would go with bands like Skold and KMFDM.
I think I've heard of those bands. They are good.
I've found out about them through Google play. It was a recommendation.
They are very good at giving recommendations. They seem to know what you like.
They will probably sound just as awesome in concert. A large component of their music is electronic.
Electronic music is really experimental/
I know this band can create all kinds of atmospheric sounds and they can mix them with metal music. It works well.
I'm curious now...is this band  on Spotify?
This band and their new release should be on Spotify and Google Play Music.
Cool. I'll check it out.
