Did you like Katy Perry's album Prism?
I thought it was okay.
Yeah, it wasn't my favorite.
I liked her album Teenage Dream the most.
Me too. Peacock is my favorite song.
Really? My favorite is Hummingbird Heartbeat.
Oh, that's not a very popular one.
Not really, but I enjoy the lyrics
What do you think about her song Not Like The Movies?
I think it's very good. I like the soft music in the background.
