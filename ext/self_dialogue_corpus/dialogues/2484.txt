What is your favorite sport again?
I love basketball, but nothing can top the NFL in my book.
I agree! It is the best thing on television in my opinion.
I have very fond memories of watching games with my grandpa when I was little.
I know what you mean, I always watched them with my dad.
Me and grandpa always debated about who the NFL's best running back was.
Did you guys debate about the best of all time?
Yes, we probably had the same debate over and over for years.
Who would you say is the best running back in NFL history?
In my opinion, nobody can touch Barry Sanders!
Barry sure was fun to watch, I will give you that one.
My grandpa always said the best ever was Jim Brown.
A lot of people who watched in those days say the same thing about Brown.
Yea, I understand he was great, but Sanders could not hardly even be tackled!
While we are talking about great running backs, I have to throw in Walter Payton's name.
I feel he is the second best running back ever, with Brown coming in at third.
It sure is a tough debate no matter how you slice it.
There is no denying that! Would you give the nod to Payton as the best ever?
Actually, I think I would call him the best one that I have ever seen.
All three of the guys we mentioned are legends without a doubt.
