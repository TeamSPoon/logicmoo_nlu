I hate how some companies milk movies
Milk?
Like they keep releasing sequels
But is that not good
No it is not
how is it bad
Well it is dilution
Dilution?
It loses quality
I guess
I mean it
but what of the fans who want more
I do not know
Well they seem to like it
They would i guess
Just think of it that way
I guess i can
It is easy
Just still irks me
I know
