Hey are you going to watch the super bowl today?
I think I will its going to be really exciting to see these two teams play.
Yes I think the score will be really close may even go into overtime on this one.
I always get excited when the game is close and the tension get really up.
I hope the weather is really good and we have some snow to go with this .
Oh the weather is going to be really cold today they might be some problems holding on to that foot ball.
I heard that one of the players is going to be sitting out dont know for sure which one
This is really going to make the game get tight if its a top player .
While I guess we will know in couple of hours how this is going to pan out .
Yes I am going to go out and get some snacks so I can sit right on that TV.
I think them Cowboys will put a kicking on this game .
Yes they do have a great winning team this year to go all the way .
There seems to be that there was some players that felt that they dod not get to play enough this year.
Well you do want to play your best player to stay ahead .
The palyers will be wearing the warmest thing they can this year won't they
I think they have special heaters for the team to use to stay warm when it gets really cold.
I heard one player say time it was so cold they could not tell they were hurt till after game .
Oh that would be awful could image how they felt after that game
I think I had better go get them snacks and get ready to sit down for a long game
Me to I ll talk to after the game and we will see how every thing went its going to be a great superbowl
