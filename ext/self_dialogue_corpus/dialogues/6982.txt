I want to watch Peter Pan again!
We have to because we can't ever grow up!
We have to stay young just like Peter and the lost boys.
Tinkerbell is so great in that movie with being so protective of Peter.
Tinkerbell makes me laugh so hard.
But Wendy is the greatest storyteller of all time.
I love how the lost boys want her to be their mom.
I sometimes even like Captain Hook.
Especially when the crocodile is after him!
That silly crocodile!
