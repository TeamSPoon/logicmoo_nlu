Hello.
Hi.
How are you doing?
Good.  You?
Good.  You a fan of basketball?
Yeah I love the NBA.
Cool, I'm a fan of college and NBA as well.
I guess I like college as well, but I like the pros more.
I think I like college more.
Why is that?
I feel like they have more to play for?
Really?
Yeah I think playing for a school when there is no money involved means more?
I guess, but I like watching the game at the highest level.
They might not be the best, but you can't beat the drama of the NCAA tournament.
I love watching the tournament, but not as much as the NBA finals.
I have to disagree.
That's okay.
Good talking to you.
You too.
