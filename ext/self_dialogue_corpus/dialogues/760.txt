Do you think there's a certain age where footballer's are just too old to play?
Unfortunately yes, because as you age, you tend to suffer injuries more.
I read about an ex NFL player who is 48 and attempting a comeback in football.
Why would someone want to play when they are past their prime?
His name is Todd Marinovich, he played for the LA Avengers over a decade ago.
Why did he leave football in the first place?
He's had substance abuse problems all his life.
Drugs really ruin an athlete's career.
He originally signed with the Raiders, but was cut before starting from failing drug tests.
I don't know why athletes do drugs when they know how strict the testing is.
He was arrested just last year over a public scene where he had drugs.
So what makes him think he should try and play football?
He says he's clean now, and since recovery has changed his life, he thinks it would have that same positive effect on his football playing.
Where is he going to play football?
He's competing for a job with the SoCal Coyotes. They are part of the World Developmental Football League.
He has to compete for a job huh? I bet there will be a lot of younger less riskier competitors.
It said he will be drug tested every week.
Maybe so, but the long term affects of being a drug user are hard on the body.
He supposedly does talks at schools and stuff about how dangerous drugs are.
I'd be more likely to listen to someone though that has been clean a long time, rahter than someone who used a long time and has only been clean a year.
