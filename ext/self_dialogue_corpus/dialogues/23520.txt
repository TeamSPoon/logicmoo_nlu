Do you want to go to the movies with me?
What were you thinking of seeing?
How about that Wonder Woman movie?
That's not really my cup of tea.
Well, are you into sci-fi at all?
It depends.
Would you want to see Guardians of the Galaxy?
Oh, I'm not really into that kind of science fiction. That more like a combination of fantasy and science fiction, in my opinion.
What kind of science fiction movies do you like?
I like the Star Trek movies.
Do you mean the older ones, or the newer ones?
Good point. I like them all, and I especially like some of the new stuff we see about the Spock character.
What do you mean?
In some of the newer movies, they have the original characters when they were much younger.
Was Spock really different?
In some ways he was a little different when he was younger. They also show him getting really angry in one of the more recent films.
Are there any new Star Trek movies out right now?
Not that I know of.
Well, would you be interested in the newest Aliens movie?
Yes! That's definitely more traditional science fiction in my opinion.
