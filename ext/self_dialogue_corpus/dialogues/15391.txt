Who was your favorite musician or band in high school?
Well, music was important to me so this is carefully chosen, Stevie Wonder.
Wow, you were an old man.  Why?
Stevie is the one stop shop for music and he's blind.
Do you think that his being blind helped?
Yes the lack of one sense was compensated for and the result is amazing.
What is so amazing?
First, Stevie played all the instruments on some of his studio albums.
How did he do that?
He would record the tracks individually.
That's incredible.  What else?
These songs were his songs, written by him.
He wrote the music and lyrics?
Yes, he did it all.
Wow, don't tell me that he also produced these tracks?
Yes in fact, a lot of times, Stevie served as the executive producer on his tracks or albums.
I did not know this about him.  I love "Uptight".
That was actually his first hit.  He wrote that when he was a child.
What, a child star?
Yes, that was his chance to break out with a music video and everything.
