Do you remember Brian aka Paul Walker from the Fast & Furious movies.
Yes, I heard he died awhile back.
Yes he did, do you remember the tribute they did for him at the end of the seventh movie?
Yes, do you know who did that song?
I believe it was Whiz Khalifa.
That's actually one of my favorite songs now.
It's such a good song and im happy that they did a tribute for Brian who was such a vital part of peoples lifes after all these movies.
Yep and i'm glad they did a good job capturing what it means to be part of someone's life.
The feels were so strong during that moment in the movie.
Yep, the song brings back those feels everytime I heard it now.
