How did you get into watching the Fast and Furious movies?
I am really into cars so of course I love those movies!
That's great!  Do you have a favorite one?
Furious 7 is my all time favorite!  The whole sequence of them dropping the cars out of the back of an airplane was totally awesome!  The ending tribute to Paul Walker was also very nice!
I totally agree!  I was worried that the movies would not be as good without him but the latest one was still very good!
I know!  They really know how to step those movies up!  The twist with Alana being captured and then later killed really was a shock to me!
I know!  It was really cool to see Dominic being bad but at the same time it was sad!
Yes!!  I thought Charlize Theron did a very good job playing a villian!
For sure!  The fact that she's hot is a plus!  I love that they also brought both Shaw brothers into the mix!
I agree!  That made the movie that more exciting!
