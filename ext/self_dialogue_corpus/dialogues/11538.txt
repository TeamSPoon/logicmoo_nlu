What do you think of the Beatles?
Best Rock band of all time.
Really? Better than Zeppelin, the Stones, Floyd, everyone?
Absolutely, no question in my mind.
What makes you say that?
They had so much impact on the music world - big bands today still try to copy their influence.
I suppose that's true.
Also their sound varied so much over time?
How so? Like different genres.
More styles - the difference between say, Meet the Beatles and Sgt. Pepper's is undeniable.
