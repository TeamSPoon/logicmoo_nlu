Are you an NFL fan?
I break out my jersey and fire up the grill every Sunday!
Who is your favorite team?
The New Orlean Saints.
They have a lot of really good players.
If Drew Brees can stay healthy they are Super Bowl contenders.
He is getting pretty old. Think he can maintain such a higj success rate?
He has a lot of good receivers backing him up.
Michael Thomas had a pretty good season.
So did Mike Ingram and with Adrian Peterson joining the team we will be strong at the Running Back position.
Why did they take AP when they already have Ingram?
Ingram may or may not remain consistent. Either way you don't pass on a legend like AP.
I would have thought he would have retired a Viking but I guess he wants to see more playing time and I am not sure he would have received that with the Vikings.
With the two strong Running Backs on the Saints Brees will not have to throw as much.
The dual running and receiving threats will give defenses something to struggle with.
Thag should create more opportunities for Brees to complete passes.
I still don't think he will maintain 4-5 touchdowns a game like he typically does.
Probably not if they are running the ball more.
If they can keep Drew healthy and get past the Falcons they may have a shot this year.
They will destroy the dirty birds this season.
