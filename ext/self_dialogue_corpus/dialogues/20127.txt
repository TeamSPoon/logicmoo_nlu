Did you get to see Beauty and the Beast?
Not yet, I knew it came out the other week, so I have just been working too much as usual!
You should go and see it, it's great!
Tell me about it!
It is a Disney remake of the classic tale, where the Beast must be transformed by love or he will die a beast.
Who plays in it?
Emma Watson, Dan Stevens, Luke Evans, Josh Gad, and Ian McKellan play in this remake.
Was the music pretty good?
Yes! Most of it was sung, and I was surprised how good it was.
Most of the time I do not go see those types of movies.
Musicals are not my type either, but they are pretty good when Disney has a hand in them.
It is doing very well in the box office.
So far it has grossed $1.25 Billion dollars.
That is insanely good!
It is the 10th best grossing film of all time.
I wonder how much the actors make off such large cuts like that?
I am sure it is in their contracts.
I can only imagine how much it will get by December.
We should go see it together.
That would be fun!
