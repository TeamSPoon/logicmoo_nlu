do you like Beyonce?
Love her.  She has so many great songs.
Yeah she's been around a while too.
Yeah, not many artist last as long as she does.
She also did a pretty awesome job during the Super Bowl.
That was crazy.  She literall  broke the stadium.
I know.  She was just pure beast mode the whole time.
She is a great talent you don't see a lot of today.
And she puts lots of energy into her songs.
I really liked Crazy in Love.
What about Baby Boy?
It was Ok I liked Run the World better.
That's one of my girlfriends favorite songs.
Well it rocks and it's empowering.
What about back to Bootylicous in Destinies Child
She sure can dance too.
Yeah I like the way she just goes all out.
Like in that Superbowl concert we were talking about.
Yeah, that was the best halftime show I've ever seen.
Me too.  Not much else can even come close.
