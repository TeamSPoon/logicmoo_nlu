What is your favorite original Star Wars movie?
Personally, mine is Empire Strikes Back.
Is there any reason why?
To me, it has the strongest story and script of all the movies. It's paced extremely well, it expands so well on what the original set up
That does make a lot of sense
Also  it has the strongest opening and closing to a Star Wars film,
Yeah not to mention that be revelation at the end
Yeah nobody even saw that coming!
It really is a great part of the original series
I would say its one of the best of the whole series.
