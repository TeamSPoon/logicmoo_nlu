Do you like Tom Petty?
Yeah I do.  His music is always pretty solid.
American Girl is one of my favorite songs.
Yeah, that's a good one.  It reminds me of that episode of Scrubs when Eliot cut her hair.
That's funny.  What other songs do you like by him?
I mean you have to like free fallin.
Oh of course.  One of the greatest songs ever made.
I mean come on.  Don't you just always sing BUT I'M FREE, FREE FAAALIN.
Of course I do.  I wouldn't be human if I didn't.
I also like won't back down.
Heck yeah, he is just a gold mine of great songs.
It's that raspy voice.  You can get easily lost in everything he does.
How about runnin down a dream.
Great song.  That's my go to for road trips.
Yeah, it fits right in there.  Right next to Steppen Wolf.
I like your style in music.
Of course, great minds think alike.
What else is a good road trip song?
Umm...  How about Tim McGraw the Ride.
Yeah, that was a good one too.
