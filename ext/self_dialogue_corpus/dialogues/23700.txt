Who is your least-favorite actor?
My god, there are so many.
Okay, list them.
Adam Sandler, Owen Wilson, Vince Vaughan, Ben Stiller.
Why them?
They only do the same role every time, it's ridiculous and doesn't show talent.
It's just typecasting. Why be mad at them for taking money offered to them?
Because it promotes low-class culture, which I can't stand.
I agree with Owen Wilson just because of his obnoxious voice.
What about you?
You may hate my answer because you like him.
Uh-oh, go ahead.
Sylvester Stallone.
WHAT?
Everything he does is way over-the-top, it's ridiculous.
They're supposed to be! The Expendables are great parody and throwback.
Yes, but the early movies aren't. His deliveries are horribly forced.
Maybe in Over The Top.
No, in everything. Over The Top was probably just an experimentation to have the 80s see what they can get away with.
You know... Stop! Or My Mom Will Shoot was pretty dreadful. I'll give you that.
