NWA was one of the most influential rap groups of the 90's.
They had alot of controversy.
True, but they also shook alot of things up.
All of the artists went on to bigger and better things.
Ice Cube is a big time actor now.
Dr. Dre went on to create and produce more music.
It was sad when Easy-E died though.
That was very unfortunate, but that sometimes goes with the lifestyle if you aren't careful.
I wonder if they will ever have a reunion?
If not, you can always go and watch the movie about their early careers.
