What was the last movie you saw?
I just saw White Chicks.
That movie was funny.
It was ok, it had it's moments.
Oh come on.  Like Terry Cruz didn't crack you up the whole time.
Ok, that guy was hilarious.
The way he just kept coming after that poor girl.  If you can call her that.
Yeah, and how could no one tell how ugly they looked.
That laugh they had was funny too.
I guess you're right.  It was pretty funny.
Like when the girl started freaking out while shopping.
Or when the FBI guy sniffed and licked the panties.
That was gross.  He's such a meathead.
How about when they started rapping.
That was awesome.
Another part when she farted in front of Terry Cruz.
And he basically just farted back.
Nothing she could do would turn him off haha.
Yeah he was the best character in the movie.
Best line "you end up in a wheel chair.
