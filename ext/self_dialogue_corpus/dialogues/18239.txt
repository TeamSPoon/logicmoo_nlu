Do you like nsync
I used to love them
Me too
Not as much as backstreet boys though
I liked nysync more
I liked their song bye bye bye
And digital getdown was a fun song
I remember that song
I used to love it
Me too
They were a good band
It sucks they broke up
It does
Have you seen that boyband show
No i wanted to watch it
Me either
I have it recorded though
Same here
I cant wait to watch it
Me too
