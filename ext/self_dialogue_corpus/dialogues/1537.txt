So you consider incomplete to be mediocre.
My basis for good includes preseason appearances which he excelled in.
Of course that might not translate when facing the regulars, but apples to apples would indicate a good QB.
But if you think Good requires Franchise QB level play for several years, then I think your standard is a bit high.
I'm pleased with the QB situation and am anxious to see where things go.
If we win half our first six games, then we are in great shape with a distinctly unfavorable schedule to begin the season.
Watson hasn't even thrown a pass yet.
I will take no touchdown passes over no passes at all.
Lol Watson needs time.
Either that or he's gonna run a lot to extend plays/generate offense.
I dont want him getting hit like Cam or RG 3rd.
Bingo! Or worse like Carr, the hits and sacks he took ruined him for the rest of his career.
Even the OL we have now could have helped see if he was as good as advertised.
It's football so he's going to get hit.
Now if you really want him to be protected. Then put him in flag football.
preseason is basically vanilla all across the board.
The game against Dallas he couldn't even read the defense against 3rd and 4th stringers.
That's the game he got hurt in.
Savage is a good quarterback. That's my opinion after watching all his film.
I concur ! After watching Osweiller all season, the superiority of Savage was ultra - obvious when he took the reins.
