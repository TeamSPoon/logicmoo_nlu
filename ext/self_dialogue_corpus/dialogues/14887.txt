What is your favorite comedy movies?
I like Young Frankenstein and Blazing Saddles a lot.
So you like old school.
No, I liked Haunted House too.
Malcolm and Kisha are great.
I loved how they ranked on Paranormal Activity.
Yeah, and Marlon Wayans is so cute
Haunted House 2 was just as funny
Remember the scene where Malcolm says "Tell him the dog is white"
Oh yes, poor Shiloh.
