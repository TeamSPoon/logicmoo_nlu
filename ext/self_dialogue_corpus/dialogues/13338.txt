So did you see Rogue One?
Oh, no, let's not talk about that movie.
You didn't like it?
It was just so sad, everyone died at the end!
Well, yeah, but they completed their mission!
Lots of people complete their missions without dying!
That's true, but they never showed up in the other films so they had to die.
I guess so, but couldn't just one of them had lived? Ride off into the sunset and never return?
I don't know, I think the sacrifice was more powerful this way. And Leia didn't die!
The tie in to the next movie was pretty cool, but I still think it was too sad.
