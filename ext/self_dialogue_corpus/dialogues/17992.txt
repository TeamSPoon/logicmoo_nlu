Hey! Have you heard Katy Perry's new song?
I don't think so. What is it called?
It is called "Swish Swish" and the song features Nicki Minaj.
Really? I love Nicki Minaj.
I know! That is why I am shocked you have not heard "Swish Swish".
Well, I don't really listen to the radio that much to be honest.
Forget the radio. She is coming to concert soon.
She is? You mean she is coming to our city!
Yes! Tickets are going on sale at midnight.
Well, I would love to see her in concert.
Me too. I think the cheapest ones start at $59.
That is not too bad. Are you buying them online?
Yes. I will put them on my card and you can pay me back.
Alright. Sounds like a plan.
I was never a fan of Katy Perry's old music but her new stuff is so good.
I have always liked her music.
Well, then you will certainly like her new stuff.
I am sure that I will.
When I get the date for the concert make sure that you request it off from work.
I will! I am so excited!
