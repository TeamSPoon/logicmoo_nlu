What would you say is the best movie franchise of the past decade?
Oh, undoubtedly The Hangover movies.
Really? Isn't that a stupid comedy franchise?
Well, yes, it's stupid, but it's the most hilarious set of movies you will ever see in your life.
I would never have guessed it from the trailers.
I can't even explain how funny the movies are, all three of them have something different and hilarious to them.
Name one thing that's funny about those movies.
Well the funniest part is the main character, Alan Garner, played by Zach Galafianakis.
Oh I've heard of him. He's in those movies?
Where have you been living? Under a rock? Bradley Cooper is also in them.
You're kidding me! Isn't he a serious actor now?
He's been in some pretty serious movies, but I guess he got his start in The Hangover comedies.
So what does this Alan do that's so funny?
He's one of those characters that's just completely weird, so strange that he's almost not human. Remember the Ace Ventura movies?
You mean like how Ace Ventura was more like a wacky cartoon character than a human being?
Exactly! And in the second movie, Ace loses almost all semblance of humanity and just becomes completely weird... Alan Garner is like that.
For example?
He says his uncle once saw an albino polar bear.
Polar bears are white, how can you tell if they're albino?
He said this one was black.
