Have you seen the Equalizer before?
No, I haven't.  What type of movie is it?
It is a thriller and suspense movie. Denzel Washington play the avenging angel and helps ChloÃ« Grace Moretz's character get out of a bad situation.
Avenging angel, Denzel must have really done a nice job in that one.
With his set of formidable skills, Denzel's character comes out of self-imposed retirement  to help those that need him.
When did that one come out?
I think it originally aired in 2014.
You saw it again recently on Netflix?
Yes I did.  I ordered it. It came in the mail on DVD.
Sounds cool. I will watch it.
