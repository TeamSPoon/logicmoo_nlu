Did you ever see Happy Gilmore?
I babysat some kids in the late 90s that would watch that everyday.
So you are familiar with it?
Yeah, pretty much.  I didn't like it at first, but it grew on me.
What did you like about it?
The whole thing ended up being pretty decent, but I liked when Adam Sandler got in the fight with Bob Barker.
Yeah!  Didn't he tell him the price was wrong or something?
Yeah, something like that and started punching him.
I don't know why Bob Barker would agree to that.
I don't either but it was funny.
