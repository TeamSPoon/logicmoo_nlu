Have you ever wondered how many species there are in the entire star wars series?
Yes I have, I'm guessing there's probably over 10,000.
I agree, even in the bar scene in A New Hope shows like 50 different species.
Its really incredible the level of detail they put into that scene with making all those different costumes.
Yeah you don't see that anymore in movies. Now a days they just use editing and visual graphics.
I wish they would make star wars movies like they used to. It was so much more engaging.
Yes it was. Especially how the light sabers looked. I always thought the old light saber fights were cooler than the new ones like in the Clone Wars.
I like the old light sabers too, but I really liked seeing Mace Windu's light saber for the first time. I had never known a jedi could have a purple one.
Yeah his purple light saber was really cool. Its a shame he died later.
Mace Windu will always be remembered though. Especially because he was played by Samuel Jackson.
