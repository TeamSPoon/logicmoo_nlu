Do you know who T.I. is?
Of course I do!
I listen to a good bit of his music. I like his voice.
I enjoy it also, I especially like his song "Live Your Life".
Isn't that a song with Rihanna?
Yes actually it is!
They did a great job on that song.
Did you know that T.I. was in a movie?
I think so, what was the name of it?
I think he may have been in a few movies but the one I mean is ATL.
Oh right I remember that movie! It was pretty good.
I agree. I liked his character.
Didn't he used to have a show on TV? Like a reality show?
I think it's called "T.I. and Tiny: Family Hustle".
Yes that is it! Not a bad show.
It's pretty decent. I'm not a huge fan of reality TV though.
I think there was another song I especially loved, trying to remember the name.
Was it recent?
I don't think so. Oh wait it was "What you know about that".
Right! I liked that song too.
