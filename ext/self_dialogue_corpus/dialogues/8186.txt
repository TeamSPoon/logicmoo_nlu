Do you think Beyonce is a good pop singer?
I think she's great.
She does have a lot of hit songs.
Almost every song she does now becomes a number one song.
Do you remember Destiny's Child?
I remember it when they had Beyonce and the original two girls.
What ever happened to them?
They tried to sue Beyonce a few years ago, but failed.
What about the two new girls, Kelly and Michelle, what happened to them.
Kelly had a song with Nelly and I have no idea about Michelle.
