what was the first kind of music you listened to?
My parents music was like Johnney Cash, Loretta Lynn...stuff like that.
Ring of Fire was a good song.
That is was.
But I mean the first music you had a chice to listen to
I guess that would be the top 40's
Freddy Fender and Elton John?
Yeah, but also Captain & Tennille and Glen Campbell.
Love Will Keep Us Together was an awesome hit.
So was Rhinestone Cowboy, Glen could belt that out.
Do you still listen to that type of music?
No I went to pop, and now I've moved over to country.
Do you remember Madonna?
Oh my God yes, some of her music and outfits!
Like a Virgin dude!
What a video! Awesome for it's time!
So now you listen to country?
Yes, I love me some Alan Jackson and George Straight!
Both very good singers, but I would have to say Garth Brooks.
I got friends in low places myself!
