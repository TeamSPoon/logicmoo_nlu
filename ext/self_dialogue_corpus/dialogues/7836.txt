I cannot believe they did a spot on job with the start of the movies though
The first one did have the best start
It did it felt pretty much perfect
Pretty much it nailed the atmosphere
Yeah it portrayed him desperate like he was in the book
It is also the most telling part
Pretty much because portrays him as a prisoner
Exactly
Yeah it would be interesting to have a movie about prior events
That would be a cool take
