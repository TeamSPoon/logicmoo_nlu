Did you prefer Cinderella or Snow White?
Wow that's like choosing between my favorite children, Cinderella if forced to choose.
Interesting, I'm firmly in the Snow White camp, why do you prefer Cinderella?
I guess the story just seemed better, had a certain level of magic with the shoes and the the evil step sister were brilliant.
I would argue that the seven dwarves supercede anything in Cinderella.
Don't get me wrong, they were the best part of Snow White, but still Cinderella was better.
But if there wasn't a Snow White, there may have never been a Cinderella, so that should trump everything else.
That's a good point, Snow White did come first, I would simply state that Disney's storytelling only got better.
No way Snow White was the first and is still the pinnacle of the Disney Princesses.
I would throw a curve ball of sorts and say that Sleeping Beauty is better than both.
