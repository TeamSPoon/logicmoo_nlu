Which of the Beatles is your favorite?
Oh I love John Lennon.
I prefer Paul McCartney.
All Paul wrote is silly love songs.
"Silly Love Songs" is a great song! But he had many.
I know he collaborated with Stevie Wonder and Michael Jackson some.
Yes, they had some hits together.
Did you know Paul is left handed?
Oh yes, he had that backward Hofner bass.
It is a weird looking guitar.
I liked some of George Harrison's solo stuff too.
Did you like Ringo Starr solo?
Not as much.
What's your favorite Beatles song?
I like Yellow Submarine.
I like "I Wanna Hold Your Hand."
That's a cheesy song.
I don't care, I like it.
There hasn't been a band as big since.
I agree with that!
