How great of a track is Hey Jude
Its like The Beatles just knew how to write music
Oh they definitely did.
They are the definitive rock band.
They have a diverse catalog to be honest.
I wish they still made new music
It would be hard considering how old they are now.
I dont think you ever forget how to write songs
Yeah but you cant make them relevant
They are a different group of people though
