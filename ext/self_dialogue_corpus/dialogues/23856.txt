Have you seen the Star Wars movies?
You mean the old ones or the new ones in theaters?
The news ones.
I've seen Force Awakens, but I haven't seen Rogue One.
What! Rogue one is where it gets good.
I don't know. I didn't like Force awakens that much despite all the hype.
Well it was hyped up a lot, but I also didn't think it was that good.
But Rogue one?
I thought rogue one hit it out of the park. I highly recommend it?
I didn't like Force Awakens because I thought it was slow and didn't get a lot of the references.
Oh you haven't seen star wars before?
No I never got into it, so all the characters are new.
That explains a lot. Most people watching these movies are die hard Star Wars fans.
Yeah, it's kind of a turnoff.
Regardless, I still think you should give Rogue One a chance. It's a lot better as a stand alone movie.
Were the reviews good?
Yeah they were much better than Force Awakens.
Okay maybe I'll check it out.
Yeah we can go together too. I wouldn't mind watching it again.
Oh nice. If you're willing to watch it again I would love to watch it.
