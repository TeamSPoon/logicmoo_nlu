Do you love Barenaked Ladies?
Who doesn't? They're awesome.
You know I'm talking about the pop band, right?
Of course. What else do you mean?
Nevermind. But good for you, I guess.
My favorite is Grade 9, for some reason.
Why is that odd?
Well, they make a lot of references of 9th grade.
Sounds like something you'd like since you're super nostalgaic.
Yeah, but they're a good decade older than me. Yet I still got the references.
