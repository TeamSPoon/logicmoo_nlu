Do you like The Red Hot Chili Peppers?
I loved them when I was in high school. Now I kind of wonder why.
What do you mean?
Their music hasn't really held up over time.
I think it still sounds pretty good.
Can you compare Anthony Kiedis' vocals to someone else from that era like Chris Cornell or Eddie Vedder?
No definitely not, I don't think Kiedis ever had a singing lesson in his life. Cornell and Vedder had far superior vocals.
Listening to the Chili Peppers now, the majority of their songs are unbearable.
I still love old songs like Under the Bridge, Breaking the Girl, Give It Away.
Yeah, that was their one album that had many good songs. But everything after that?
I guess you're right. Although Mother's Milk had some good songs.
Yes, their earlier stuff wasn't too bad. Not great, but not bad. Mainly it's everything after Blood Sugar Sex Magic I'm referring too.
For example?
Californication? That album is just intolerable.
That's hilarious. Well, since you mentioned Chris Cornell just now, isn't it sad that he passed away?
It really is. Such a talented and beautiful person, gone way too soon.
I wonder why he committed suicide.
There are probably so many reasons, who can say?
It's a shame he felt there was no way out.
Yes, truly a great loss for the music world.
