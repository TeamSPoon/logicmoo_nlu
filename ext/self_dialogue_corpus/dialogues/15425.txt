do you know Asamoah Gyang
No don't think i have heard of him, what's he into?
He is a footballer and he's on the Ghanaian national team
maybe if i see a picture of him i might recognize him, you know i don't follow football that much.
Far from football mate, the dude also do rap music to my amazement
i thought you said he's a soccer star
yes but he got some rapping skills that few never knew until now, i just saw his video up on MTV tittle "king of both worlds"
that's some gift and talent, but how was his flow? tight?
just too tight, he flows like your everyday rapper,if you haven't seen him play football you can't tell he does.lol
that's good for him though, he can always switch career if one is failing.lol
with what i have just heard from him i think the rapping suite him better
with the way you're hyping him seems the boy is good then.
he's let me send you the audio link,i purchased it soon as i saw the video, that was how much i love the flow.lol
alright i'll check him out on apple music, he'd better worth the whole hype you've given him, hence you'll pay back the money i'll purchase it with.lolz
