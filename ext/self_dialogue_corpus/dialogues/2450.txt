Are you ready for some football this year?
Hell yea! I can't wait Falcons all the way this year baby.
You really think they will make the Super Bowl again?
I do Matt Ryan was on fire last year no one will stop him.
I don't know Tom Brady and the Patriots I think might repeat.
No way man Brady is getting old and Matt Ryan is still young and has alot of years in front of him.
The Seahawks and Packers are tough too. I like Aaron Rodgers.
Rodgers isn't too bad. Cam Newton is good but he needs more weapons. Panthers has a chance.
Panthers I agree unless the Saints come around. Drew Brees hasn't been himself lately.
Drew Brees needs to retire. The problem with quaterbacks is they don't know when to call it quits.
You mean like Brett Favre. He kept playing and playing.
Exactly he never knew when to quit. Speaking of the Falcons did you hear they are retiring Michael Vick?
I did regardless of his criminal record he was still a hell of an athelete. I still think he would have made a better running back.
Yes I agree once he starts running no one could stop him.
You know it could be the Patriots and the Falcons again in the Super Bowl this year. Imagine that.
Never happened before in the history of the NFL I don't think two teams repeating. One team yes but not two teams.
With the Falcons getting the new stadium this year that would be great too.
We will see what happens if Oakland's quarterback doesn't get hurt at the end of the season they might go further this year.
Yes that was horrible for them. That rookie was amazing too.
This season will be great to see what these second year quarterbacks can do.
