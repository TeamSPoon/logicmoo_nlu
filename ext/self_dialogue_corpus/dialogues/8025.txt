Sia or Adele?
Who am I more in love with?
No, who is the better singer-songwriter?
Sia, for sure.
Why? Adele has so much soul
Yes, but Sia has maturity. She's far older and more experienced.
Adele is writing about her live evolving, though.
Yes, but her style is so one-note. Plus she only knows two dynamics.
Which two?
Piano and FORTISSIMO. There's no middleground. Sia is balanced.
