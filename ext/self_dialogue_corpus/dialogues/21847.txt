Hey There are you going to see the new pirates of the caribbean Movie?
Oh yeah! I went because the reviews said it was the best pirates movie since the first!
I saw people even dressing up as pirates to go into the movie!
Oh yeah? What was your favorite part of the movie?
I like the idea that Henry Turner would be able to save his father from being eternally tied to the ship
yes yes! That was sentimental for me.. since you know my dad is sick at the moment.
Yeah I know. I hope he recovers soon!
Yeah we are all praying.
For the movie.. I liked the addition of Capitan Salazar
Yeah its about time they added some more ethnic diversity!
Javier Bardem is one of my favorite actors
He is so flexible.. able to play any role!
Yeah he was amazing in this movie as always.
Did you hear they are already making a sequel?
