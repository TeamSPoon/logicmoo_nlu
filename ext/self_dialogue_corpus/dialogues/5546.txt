Oh my God wasn't Moana the greatest!
It was cool. Why all the excitement though?
Why all the excitement are you kidding me? Did you not watch the same movie I did? I thoroughly loved it! Maui cracked me me up. I was laughing so hard.
He was alright. I think Grandma Tala was cool.
She was cool too but Maui was my favorite. I liked the message that it sent too. That no matter what do not be afraid to do the impossible. Do not be afraid to pursue your dreams.
You have a point there. I got that too. I liked when the wave knocked Moana over though and she wanted to quit and her Grandmother encouraged her not to quit. Kind of like life. No one promises that it won't get rough when you decide to follow your dreams but the idea is not to quit. Keep on pursuing your dreams no matter how difficult it gets.
Ahem, now look who is getting all philosophical over Moana. (Smiles) You are absolutely right. Do you know I felt so exhilarated after watching it. It really was nice and a gentle reminder.
Did you know that Dwayne Johnson played you beloved Maui.
Yes I do and when I found out I love Maui even more.
You're a nut job you know that, but I am glad you enjoyed the movie. The truth is, I enjoyed it too, I just wanted to give you a hard time.
