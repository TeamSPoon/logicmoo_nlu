Have you heard any good pop music recently?
I have really got into Miley Cyrus as of late.
Do you like her style?
I did not like her older, sort of mix between pop and country songs, but the new stuff I do.
I liked her song, "Wrecking Ball".
That was a good one, very pop and bubble gum type of feel you know?
I think she does ok with the pop style. Like her album Dead Petz.
I think that one was good. Lot of upbeat stuff.
I like that she draws from others a lot
She does do similar stuff to other pop artists.
