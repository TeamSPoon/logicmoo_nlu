The song "A Girl Worth Fighting For" is totally ruined by the ending, I think.
Wait, what ending?
Oh, don't you remember from the movie?
No.
They're marching along and singing that song, and then they suddenly stop singing because they see the village that's been destroyed.
Oh now I remember! Yeah, that's so sad.
The little girl's doll! I cried, probably.
Oh yeah I felt so bad for her.
Disney movies make me cry all the time though.
Yeah, Tarzan...The Lion King...ok, they've all made me cry probably.
