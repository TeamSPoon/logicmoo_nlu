So do you listen to a lot of rock music?
I usually listen to it when I am in the car.
Have you found any modern bands that you like?
I like a couple, but I mainly like the older stuff.
Who is one of the new bands you like?
I like Coheed and Cambria.
I like them, but I know what you mean about the old stuff being better.
I just feel like no one has really lived up to what those bands did.
I know, KISS and Metallica will always be the golden age to me.
I agree. They just don't play like them anymore.
