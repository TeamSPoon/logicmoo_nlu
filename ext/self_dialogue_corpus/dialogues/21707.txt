Have you seen Frozen?
Yeah, my daughter loves it.
Mine too, it was actually pretty good.
Yeah, except I'm getting sick of hearing let it go.
I did like the kind of heroine that Elsa was.
It was good that she was such a strong female hero, that didn't have to run off and get married in the end.
Olaf was good too.  Always great to have that breakout character.
While I'm sick of the song, first time I saw it the scene was good when Else unleashed her powers.
I know it was cool how she built that castle.
I loved that.
Chrisoph was pretty good too.
Yeah, and everyone thought Anna was crazy for marrying a guy she just met.
Basically the opposite of all other Disney movies.
I know, that was good how it wasn't lets run off and marry someone we just met.
I liked at the end when Elsa finally got control over her powers.
Yeah, and Olaf got to experience the summer.
He did.  He had that funny song about it earlier.
Oh man, speaking of funny those trolls were pretty good too.
Yeah I almost forgot about them.
No kidding.  Good movie.
