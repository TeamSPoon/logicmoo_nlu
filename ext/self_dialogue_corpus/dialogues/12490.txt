What is your favorite star wars movie overall?
Its an unpopular opinion but i really liked Rogue One
I actually really liked rouge one to, it was a great prequel
I did aswell, i really enjoyed jyn and cassian the casting was done very well
I know what you mean, my favorite part was the ending when they actually get on Scarif. The fighting was great
That part of the movie was definetley impressive visually aswell as other parts of the movie
I actually really liked the original star wars so the very end sequence seeing leia get the death star plans made me very happy
I know what you mean the end was so simple but so complex at the same time
Rogue one did such a good job of building its own story but being connected to to star wars at the same time
Thats why its my favorite star wars movies, great characters, action and a great story.
