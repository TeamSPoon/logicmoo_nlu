What's the craziest concert you ever went to?
Woodstock 99. It was 3 days of crazy, but it was an awesome crazy.
What made it different and more crazy than other concerts?
The people walking around NAKED. I never saw that at any other concert.
Oh my God. I would have died laughing. Did you stare a lot?
No, I was too busy taking pictures!
Oh how funny. But- wait- wasn't that the Woodstock where they had a fire?
Yes, and it was all because of stupid Limp Bizkit.
What did they do?
He told everyone they were going to tear the place down, and then yelled for everyone to tear the place down.
And so the fans did?
The staff handed out candles to everyone for a sunset vigil, and everyone used the candles instead to start fires. But they wouldn't have done it if stupid Fred from Limp Bizkit wasn't yelling at everyone to tear the place down.
He sounds like a jerk.
Some girls supposedly were raped in the mosh pit during that set. I stayed at the back of the field because I knew that band had a reputation for violent mosh pits.
What were some of the nice things you saw?
Rage Against The Machine playing slow to calm everyone down. Flea from Red Hot Chili Peppers playing with blue hair and naked. People who were nice to other people.
What was something crazy YOU did?
The plywood wall around the event was painted with murals. At the end everyone started breaking off pieces of the plywood so they could all take home small painting sized pieces of the mural. And I took a piece too.
If you had the chance to do it again, would you?
Oh yes, because it was like a different world, and everyone felt so free, which is why they went naked, and it felt so alive and such an adventure.
