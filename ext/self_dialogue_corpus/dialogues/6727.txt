I am excited about the new Toy Story movie.
There's a new Toy Story movie?
Yes, it will come out in a couple years.
Wow, that is exciting.
I wonder what is gonna happen?
Yeah, since Andy is grown up. I'm not sure what else they can do.
They will probably use that girl from the last one.
Maybe. Do you think it will be good?
Yes, but the first is the best.
Oh, I love the first one. It is so innovative.
