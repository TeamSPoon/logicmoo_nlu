Have you ever heard of newgrass music
I actually have
do you like it
yes I love the way bluegrass music is taken and made modern
so do I it is huge in the festival scene
what newgrass groups do you like
- The Del McCoury Band is good
I have not heard of them
The Spikedrivers are also really good
I love the mandelin in most of the newgrass music
I do as well, it is a great sounding instrument that is underused
who else do you like
Head For The Hills  has a unique sound
wow I havent heard of that one
you need to take a listen to them
do you stream their music on a service
I usually just buy the cd's
I like to do that too it supports these smaller bands
I cant wait until a newgrass festival comes close to me
that would be great to see all kinds of band together in a festival style concert
