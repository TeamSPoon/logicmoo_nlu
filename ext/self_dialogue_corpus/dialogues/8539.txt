I've been listening to Christina Aguilera today!
What a blast from the past!
I know. I'm listening to Dirty right now.
I never liked that one. I like her more emotional songs.
Which ones?
Well my favorite is You Are Beautiful.
That song is so beautiful!
The lyrics really resonate with me.
Her voice is one of the best voices in pop music.
I wish she would come out with a new song.
