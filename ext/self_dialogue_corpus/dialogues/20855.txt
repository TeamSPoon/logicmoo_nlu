Did you watch Baywatch the movie?
No, that looked really stupid.
It wasn't stupid, it was funny.
I doubt that it was funny, you were probably just charmed by the actors in it.
Well, isn't that what every movie is about?
No, movies should be about plot development, and character design, and pacing.
Baywatch has those things.
Again, I doubt it. Baywatch has beautiful people, that's it. That's all baywatch has ever been.
Ok, but some movies are just about having fun, Baywatch is one of those movies.
Too many movies seem to be focused on mindless fun these days.
Well, I watched it because I'm a big fan of the Rock.
I am too, but really, he should stick to cooler roles.
But he's the rock, nobody is going to give him cooler roles.
That's a good point. I guess he probably plays basically the same character in every movie.
Yea, in Fast n Furious he plays a big buff cop that nobody can beat.
Well he was awesome in The Rundown.
Yea, he really was, but again, big tough guy that nobody can beat.
Very true. But he does it so well.
Yea probably because that's who he is in real life.
Obviously, but he's also really funny and caring too.
