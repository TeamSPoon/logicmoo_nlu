Hi Ella!, how is everything? we are ending June and feels like christmas so far!
Oh yes!!, which make me wonder, which is your favorite christmas movie?
Oh!!! The Grinch! I love that movie! I can watch it anytime I want to laugh and feel like a kid again.
Same for me!, I like how Jim Carrey plays the grinch, it is very fun, all the gestures and the "grinchie" attitude haha
I would like to watch it again, but I didn't have it at home...
Well I have the movie, my two little nieces love to watch it, so I have it at my place, would you like to borrow it?
Thank you!, but I would not like to leave your two nieces whitout the chance to watch the movie!
Ok, so then, let me go with you to but the movie for yourself, which movie genre it is?
it is a Fantasy movie, released in 2005; the movie is during an hour and 45 minutes
Oh yes, I remember, I can´t wait to see it! what do you like the most about the movie?
I like the message of the movie, no matter our different ways to see the things, we all can work together and make something beautiful.
Yes, it is true, it is a good message for the childreen and also the adult audience.
Do you prefer to this movie than other ones in the market?
Yes, it is fun and it is something you can share with all the family
So, would you like us go arrange a movie night? with all the closest friends and family?
