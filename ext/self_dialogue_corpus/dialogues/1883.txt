What teams do you think are going to the Super Bowl this year ?
I think it's going to be the Dolphins and the Seahawks.
I don't think the Dolphins can beat out the Patriots to win their division.
I think this is going to be the year they finally do it.
I really don't want to see the Patriots in the Super Bowl again, so I hope you're right.
I'm sick of seeing the Patriots in the Super Bowl also.
They've been in two of the last three Super Bowls.
They won two of the last three Super Bowls.
They also have been in six Super Bowls since 2004.
Yes, seven if you go back to 2002.
Oh yeah, that's right. I think they won five of those.
Yes, five Super Bowl wins in the last fifteen years.
It is easier to win when you deflate the balls to your advantage.
Yes, that does help a little.
I think I will have to cheer for the Dolphins real hard this year.
There's no chance of anyone else in the AFC East knocking out the Pats.
Who else is in the AFC East besides the Fins and the Pats ?
The Bills and the Jets.
Well you're right about that, no chance for those two teams.
Maybe that's why the Patriots have been to the Super Bowl so many times lately.
