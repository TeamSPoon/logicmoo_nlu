Do you like the droids in Star Wars?
Some of them. I like BB-8 and R2D2
What about C-3PO?
I find him very annoying
Really? He's one of the major stars of the show.
Yeah, I guess it wouldn't be Star Wars without them.
Aren't they in every single one?
I believe so. Some more than others.
Yeah, they're like a continuity piece for every single film.
I thought BB-8 was really fun.
