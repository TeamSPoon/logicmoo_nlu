How long do you think we could have a conversation for with just song lyrics and have it actually make sense?
Seriously?
Yeah, it'd be fun.
Let it go.
That's the spirit.
That's not what meant.
Tell me what you want.
I will kill you.
Oh, despicable me.
The only song lyrics you know come from children's movies.
That's not true!
Ha ha, I threw you off after two lines.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Gotcha!
I hate you.
You should lighten up.
You should stop harassing me with songs that I don't want stuck in my head.
Sigh, okay.
Thank y... no, I'm not falling for that again!
