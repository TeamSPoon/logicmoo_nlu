What's a really good, scary horror movie that you've seen?
"Hostel" was such a scary movie for me.
I haven't seen it.  What's it about?
Basically, some young adults that are traveling are used as subjects of torture and death by wealthy people that pay to use them in that way.
Is it gory?
Very gory.  Lots of blood and disturbing images.
Why does it bother you?
Because it makes you nervous about traveling in places where you are not familiar with the area or the dark secrets that might be there.
What would be the youngest that you think someone should be to see it?
Well, it could be disturbing for anyone, but I think at least 16 and probably closer to 18.  Definitely not young kids or pre-teens.
