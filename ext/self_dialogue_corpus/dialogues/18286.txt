Do you like Queen?
Yes, my favorite band form the 70's.
Me too, I mean We are the Champions is the epitome of winning.
Yeah, I really like Another One Bites the Dust.
What about Somebody to Love?
Yes, one of the best songs ever made.
It's just musically unbeaten in popular music.
It was something special.  Took talent with those counter melodies.
What about We Will Rock You.
Yep, perfect sports song.
I always liked Killer Queen.
Me too, again with the counter melodies.  That band was just musically sound.
Yeah, and the Highlander soundtrack was epic.
I know, people forget about that because the movie isn't that popular anymore.
Yeah, I'd like to see them reboot that.  But keep the soundtrack.
Without a doubt.
One of my favorite songs, Fat Bottom Girls.
Me too, it's a little cheeky no pun intended.
Ha, that was a good one.
Thanks, I thought so too.
