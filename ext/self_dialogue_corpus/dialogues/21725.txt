Have you seen Borat?
Yes! I love that movie.
What did he do after Borat?
Who? Sacha Baron Cohen?
Yes, Sacha Baron Cohen.
He did some other things like The Dictator.
Were they good?
Not really. Not as good as Borat.
Borat was really funny.
Yes, I agree.
Where did he go to school?
I don't know, somewhere in England.
I think he had a mini-series based on the character as well.
Yes, I think so too.
I watched him go to an English club and he went to Cambridge too.
I saw some of those on YouTube.
That had to be in 2003, right?
Somewhere around there. Maybe 2004.
Did you see Borat when it came out in theaters?
No, I waited a few years.
