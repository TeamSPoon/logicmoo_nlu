I hate jumping on bandwagons.
What do you mean?
Well when a new show comes out and everyone loves it I don't want to love it too.
You're turning into a hipster. What brings this up?
Dear Evan Hansen.
My name's not Evan. What are you talking about?
It's a musical that opened not long ago that the world is in love with.
The whole world?
Well, the Broadway world and some talk shows, and TIME. I think I might be in love with it too.
And that's bugging you because you don't want to follow the fad?
Yeah. The trouble is though the music is really good!
I'm having a hard time feeling sympathy for you.
And the lead. Ben Platt, he's amazing. His acting is deep and spot on.
This sounds like something I should check out.
You really should. The live performances I've seen from him on tv are amazing.
What's so amazing about them?
He's just really raw. His voice is awesome but he's not flawless because the character wouldn't be.
So he's really acting the songs instead of just singing pretty?
Yeah. I saw a clip of him doing For Forever and it was stuck in my head for days.
Hipster or not it sounds like you've joined the masses, friend.
