What movies do your kids watch?
Oh my kids love Disney movies!
What are their favorite movies ?
The younger one loves Frozen and the elder one loves tangled .
Isn't frozen the one with the song? Let it go?
My God! my kids played that song on repeat for hours!
Haha , I can understand your pain, do you watch disney movies ?
Yes I have to see the whole movie with them , they wont watch it without me.
