Almost time for the NFL season!
Indeed! Training camp starts soon, doesn't it.
Yes, July 22nd. And the first preseason game is August 3rd.
When does the regular season start?
September 7th. First game of the season is the Chiefs at the Patriots.
That should be a good game. The Chiefs have been surprisingly good the last few years.
Yeah, they went 12-4 last season. Lost the divisional playoff to the Steelers.
I'm a Packers fan. Who do they play week 1?
They're at home vs the Seahawks for their first game.
Man, I have hated the Seahawks ever since the Fail Mary game.
Which was that?
It was a 2012 Packers-Seahawks game played with the replacement refs.
Oh, right! They didn't call pass interference so the Seahawks won.
Exactly. The thought of that game still makes my blood boil a bit!
That's understandable.
This week one Giants at Cowboys game should be interesting too.
Man, I am so curious to see how the Cowboys do this year.
Yeah, putting all their chips on Dak Prescott.
I hope for their sake he doesn't get a case of the sophomore slumps!
If he does, you can bet Tony Romo will be laughing all the way to the bank.
