Have you seen the movie Split?
No, I haven't.  Isn't that about the person with a split personality?
Yeah, its the one with the guy from x-men.  It's pretty crazy.
Was it scary?
It's not too scary.  It was interesting though how they explained the mental illness that causes his "split personality."
Huh.  I want to see that.  I just haven't gotten to it yet.
You should definitely go and see it.  I don't like the boundary issues with the psychiatrist.  Otherwise it's great.
What's up with the psychiatrist?
She meets with her patients out of her house.
Oh, that's scary.  Why would she do that?
I don't know.  It's even crazy because she only meets people with dissociative identity disorder.
That's creepy and dumb of her.
That's the part that I had a hard time getting over.  She even tells the patient that she lives alone.
That's crazy.  I would never tell a client that.
Me either.  It was all pretty believable until the end.
What happens at the end?
The main character actual turns into another person.
So, it's a fictional movie.
Parts were fictional.  Parts of it could be real.
I definately want to check it out still.
