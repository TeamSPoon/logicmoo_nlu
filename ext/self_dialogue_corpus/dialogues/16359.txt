Do you ever listen to classic rock?
It depends which decade you're talking about.
I mean the '70s. Do you ever listen to that stuff.
I listen to some of it. There were so many good, classic bands that got big during that decade.
I agree. There's Led Zepellin, Queen, Creedence Clearwater Revival and so many more.
I noticed you still hear there music all over the place on TV and in the movies.
Yes. You often hear "We Are the Champions" for example, or "We Will Rock You".
I've noticed Creedence Clearwater Revival songs sometimes make it in to movies about the '70s.
They were on the soundtrack for Forrest Gump.
They were also on the soundtrack for Big Lebowski, I believe.
Then there's bands like The Who.
The Who is truly an all-time famous classic rock band.
Roger Daltrey and Pete Townshend inspired so many rock musicians.
I feel like their brand of classic rock is more rebelious than a lot of the other bands.
It is. Though, it's not quite as rebelious as Black Sabbath, or something like that.
That's another classic band that inspired a lot of musicians.
Yes. Heavy metal musicians often point to Black Sabbath as a key influence.
And of course Ozzy Osborne is from Black Sabbath.
Exactly. He's another one of those iconic figures.
I can't imagine rock and heavy metal without him.
