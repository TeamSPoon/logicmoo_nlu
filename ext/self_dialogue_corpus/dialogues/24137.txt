Hey, wanna watch the Fall with me?
What is that?
It's really hard to describe. It's a weird movie that's kind of a drama.
Weird how?
In that it can be sketchy to figure out the twists and which characters are present in flashbacks and such, but it's so well done.
I might be willing to give it a go.
It takes place in California, my home and favourite state, and the acting and photography and everything is amazing.
Sounds good!
Yeah, I'm surprised it's not more well known. It's way underrated in my opinion.
Well you'll help me if I get confused, right?
Right! It has an awesome story surrounding this guy in the hospital, there are just a couple places that leave you wondering what's really happening.
Well I find some of my favourite movies have been ones that are more open to interpretation.
That's basically what this is.
Is it a sad movie? I don't like really sad dramas.
I'll be honest, there was one scene that made me a little teary, and I don't usually get that way in movies.
Just one scene?
Yeah, you see the 2 main characters building this rapport and then this scene happens between them and it's just... well, you have to see it.
Who's the other character besides the guy in the hospital?
It's the little girl who goes to visit him. She kind of stumbles upon him and they form this accidental friendship and fun fact, where you hear them misunderstanding each other because of her accent, that wasn't scripted, she really couldn't understand because she was learning english in real life.
Aw, that's so cute!
