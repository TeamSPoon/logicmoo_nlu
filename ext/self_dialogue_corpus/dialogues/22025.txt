What is the best movie you've seen lately?
I saw "Hunt For The Wilder People." Did you see it?
No, what's it about?
Sam Neil is in it. I think it takes place in New Zealand. It's kind of coming of age movie.
Sounds interesting...
It's one of those with this really off beat kid that ends up with Sam Neil and their relationship.
There has to be more to it than that. Is it funny? Sad? What?
It's pretty funny. Sometimes it's dry humor. Maybe a little heart touching too. I don't want to give it away but you should see.
You gotta give me more than that.
The scenery is beautiful. The struggles the kid goes through are typical. It will remind you of being a kid.
So thankful that I am grown up now...
No doubt. This kid, Ricky is so fun. He's an obese, off beat kid that you just like. He has aspects that are annoying and endearing.
You know I think I saw the trailer.
Ah, the great trailer....it just a series of kind of weird things that happen. It's hard to explain.
But you really liked it?
Yeah, it reminded me of "Son of Rambo." Did you see that one?
No, is it similar?
Yeah, coming of age...2 friends....one is obsessed with Rambo. It's hysterical. Just feel good all around.
Sounds like that might be good too. I'll have to look for it.
Yeah, while you're at it, look for "Moonrise Kingdom." I need the feel good escape and these are great.
