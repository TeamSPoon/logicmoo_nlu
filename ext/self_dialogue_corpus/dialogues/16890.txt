When you go the gym for a good workout, what kind of music do you tend to listen to?
It kind of depends on what I am doing, to be honest.
As in if you are lifting weights or doing cardio?
Exactly. For weight training exercises, rock music really gets me into the zone.
And what about cardio? Do you preference?
For my cardio, I can do just about any type of music, as long as I enjoy what I am hearing.
Does one particular genre mesh well for you in the cardio session?
To be honest, '90's pop just has a well good ring to it that keeps me going.
That is always a good thing. Whatever works best for you!
I know you go the gym, as well. So, what about you?
I actually made a playlist on my phone specifically for my workout routine.
That sounds like a smart idea. What type of music is on your playlist?
A little bit of everything, honestly. From Country, to pop, to heavy metal.
I don't know if I could workout to Country music. That just may not do much for me.
I am not too picky with what I can workout to. Sometimes I'll even enjoy some EDM music.
Same here! Are you a Skrillex fan?
I enjoy their music, For some reason, Avenged Sevenfold just has a bit that I love, so I workout to their music quite often.
Well, they are just a great band overall!
I definitely agree with that. Sometimes I'll just take my earbuds out and listen to whatever music the gym is playing, as well.
That is a good way to discover new artists, so I applaud that idea.
