How are you doing ?
I am great! Just listening to some music.
What are you listening to?
I have been listening to  Matchbox Twenty all day.
I used to love them when I was younger.
Yea me to! I used to have all of their albums.
I went to a couple of their concerts.
Cool, how were they?
They were great. I had a lot of fun.
I always loved that song Push.
Yea that song was awesome!
Which one of their songs was your favirote?
That is a really tough question! They have so many great ones.
Tell me about it!
I would have to say either Three A.M or  When Your Gone.
Those are both great songs!
I know, I could listen to them all day.
Rob Thomas is very talented.
I think he has always been underrated.
I agree with you about that.
