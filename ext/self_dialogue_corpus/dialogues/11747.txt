Have you heard the new remastered Sgt. Pepper's album?
Yeah, it's great!
What's your favorite track?
"Being For the Benefit of Mr. Kite"
That's a good one. My favorite is "A Day in the Life"
Yeah, I like that one too.
Sgt. Pepper's is also one of my all time favorite album covers.
Mine too. I've spent a lot of time in the past just looking at it.
By the way, who's your favorite Beatle? Mine's George.
John
