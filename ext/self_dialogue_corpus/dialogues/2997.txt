Are you ready for another grand season of football?
As long as the Patriots don't win again of course!
Tell me about it. They look even better than last year, which is bothersome and scary.
It seems futile to even sit there and hope they do bad. I don't think it's possible until Brady's gone. If he ever leaves.
Do you think anyone in the AFC can knock them off?
I like to believe that everyone in the AFC West, but the Chargers could do such.
The Broncos have definitely had Brady's number very time he plays them.
He still won against them last season, but that was mostly because poor QB play by the Broncos.
As long as you have a defense like the Broncos you can definitely keep up with Brady.
It's a matter of being proficient and effective in your drives.
Just have 3 or 4 good drives including redzone scores and honestly you can beat them with a Broncos-like defense.
The problem is the Pats defense has random bouts of greatness.
Yeah, it's weird. They had like the 25th best defense, but still won in that comeback victory.
They were getting torched yet for the last quarter and a half shut Matt Ryan out with ease.
Just thinking about that Falcons' choke in the SuperBowl is so depressing.
I think a majority of the country outside of Massachusetts felt that way.
They literally just needed one touchdown and history would have been declined.
I suppose that is what makes them so grace
There really is no denying Brady is the best ever.
I hate to agree with such, but I have to agree.
