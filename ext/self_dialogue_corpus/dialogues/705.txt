So who is your favorite team in the NFL?
The Pittsburgh Steelers of course!
Have you seen their schedule for the upcoming year?
Yeah, I have, and it looks pretty good.
What do you like about it?
Well, for one, even thought the team doesn't like it, I am happy they are playing on Christmas this year.
I know what you mean, makes it easier to get a break from all the holiday stuff.
I like that I get to do one of my favorite things on one of the best days of the year.  Watch Steeler Football!
Are they at home at least?
No. Not only do they have to play on Christmas but they also have to travel. They are playing Houston.
The Oilers. Who else do they play this year?  I mean, besides the division games.
The first home game is with the Minnesota Vikings.
Do they start the season at home?
No. They start on the road, against the Browns. They have two divisional games in the first month.
Who do they play after the Vikings?
The play Chicago.
Da Bears.
Da Bears.  And they are on the road for that game as well.
Are they going to be on television this season?
Yes, of course. Five primetime games are scheduled, and the playoffs will be televised, so of course they will be in those!
