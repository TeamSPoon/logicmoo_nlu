Yesterday I watched Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince!
Oh yeah? What'd you think?
I couldn't believe the ending! I never thought that Dumbledore was going to die.
Isn't that part wild? I think Dumbledore had it planned the entire time though.
He must have a lot of faith in Harry if he can get killed and know that things are going to work out.
Yeah. Throughout the whole series all he's really said though is to trust Harry, so he must know what he's doing.
I also liked how we're introduced to the concept of Horcruxes in this movie.
Remind me again what a Horcrux is?
It's when you split your soul into pieces to try to live forever, so even if your body dies your soul lives on and you can come back to life.
Oh that's right. Voldemort split his soul into seven parts, if I remember correctly.
