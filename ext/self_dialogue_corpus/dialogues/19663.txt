Do you think The Ramones were influential?
I actually think they were over rated!
Wow thats the first time I heard that.
They only played a few chords and didnt have much in terms of lyrics.
They laid the groundwork on how to write a punk song.
Their songs werent that punk
Well punk enough to not be considered a radio play.
I hear them all the time on the radio.
right because they now play a version of punk that would be considered pop music.
I just wasnt a fan of how many different Ramones there was.
I agree it was hard to keep track but that doesnt mean they didnt do their job.
I wasnt saying that, I just think they werent as big as everyone says.
So do you feel the same way about Nirvana?
Yes because bands like Pearl Jam were coming out as well.
So who would you conisder influential?
No one really, I think all music just evolves.
So you think a new music genre is being formulated today, somewhere?
Yes.
And who do you think influenced that person to try a new brand of music.
No one, I think it just happens.
