NFL preseason is right around the corner !
I know I'm so excited I can't wait
me too. I can't wait to see all the new faces on new teams
omg right! I can't believe Peterson isn't a viking this year
yea he was on them for years! he's hands down the best running back ever
you think? he think he'll be good this year
yea with brees as this quarterback and a great team like the saints he will.
only a few more weeks to see and find out lol.
I'm also excited to see lynch back!
I can't believe his back!
beastmode !!!!
lol. the raiders are my surprise pick for the super bowl
oh boy have a big hill to climb to beat the patriots.
I know I know. but I have faith, especially with carr coming back healthy
oh yea that's right he was hurt as soon as they got to the playoffs last year
yea and then got knock out first round thanks you the terrible back up smh.
it'll be a great match up. I have to go with the Steelers this year
oh I like that one too. I hope its either one of them and not the annoying pats
hahaha I agree
let's go .... anyone but the pats!!!
