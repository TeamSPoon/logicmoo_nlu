Are you gonna watch the new Star Wars movie that comes out later this year?
They have another one coming out so soon?
Yea, they are putting one out each year - usually around December I think.
I'm not sure if I'll see anymore.
Why not?
I didn't really like the idea of them killing off Han Solo.
Yea, neither did out but it did make for a good surprise.
Still not sure about seeing the others.
Will you go if I buy your ticket?
Of course, I'll watch just about anything for free!
