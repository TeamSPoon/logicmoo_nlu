So, what genres of movies do you get into other than comedy and action?  Do you watch horror?
Not in general, though I did like the Evil Dead series and I also liked the Hellraiser series.
Oh, that's interesting.  Evil Dead is comedy-horror and Clive Barker is supernatural horror and body horror.
Wow I didn't know that.  I just thought of it as creative horror.
Well it has to do with what is causing the feeling of horror in you.
The thing is, it doesn't cause horror as much to me.  Now The Ring, that was more scary to me.
Yes, that was scary.  I guess different strokes for different folks when it comes to horror.
Yeah, I think it was visually creative with Pinhead and those other guys.
So, what else do you remember from the Hellraiser movies?
I remember the part at the end of one of the movies when that guy said, "What is your pleasure?", and he was on that rotating thing.
