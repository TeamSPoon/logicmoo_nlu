Which are cuter, the puppies from 1001 Dalmatians or the kittens from the Aristocats?
I like dogs better than cats, so I'm biased.
I get it, but the kitten that plays piano is so cute.
Aw yeah, that's a great scene.
Overall I think the Aristocats is the better movie.
Cruella de Vil is such a great villain though!
Oh, I hated her.
That's sort of the point.
No, I just thought she was mean, and not in a fun way.
True. Killing puppies is way too cruel.
