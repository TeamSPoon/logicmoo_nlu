Didi you see the latest Matthew McConaughey?
What is the name of it?
Gold.
Are you sure that that is his last movie?
Well, I'm not quite sure, but it is one of the newest. Anyway, have you seen that one?
No. I haven't heard too much about that movie.
You need to see it! He gives a great performance.
It is interesting how he is now doing more challenging roles in movies.
Definitely. In this one there are parts where he is basically unrecognizable.
Who else is in the movie?
Edgar Ramirez.
I've heard recently a lot about him. How is his performance?
Yes, he has been in a bunch of movies lately. I though he was also very good in this one.
So, one is the good guy and the other is the bad guy in the movie?
It's more complicated than that. They make a great team on screen though.
But tell me about the plot.
Well, they are seeking for gold somewhere in a jungle in some country, and they go through a bunch of problems.
That doesn't tell me much.
Well then, see it! I don't want to sopil it.
Ok, I will.
