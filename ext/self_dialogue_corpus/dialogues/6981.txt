My favorite Disney movie is the Princess and the Frog.
I know mine too.  It was so romantic.
I love the scenery and the storyline.  Princess Tiana is so beautiful.
Oh and Prince Naveen is so handsome.  I love that it was set in New Orleans.
Me too.  The bayou and the food.  Delicious.
Its making me hungry for some jumbalaya and some beignets.
I wish they would make a sequel to that.  Do you think they have children?
I do too.  I would love to see their life together and yes they must have children.
And they lived happily ever after.
Exactly.
