Have you ever seen The Hangover?
Only a bunch of times.
I saw it again two nights ago.
It is hilarious.
I like the part where they steal the tiger.
Mike Tyson was mad.
The guy with the beard is funny.
His Wolfpack speech was awesome.
He went to NC State.
Oh. That's where he got it.
Of course. The baby scenes were good.
He puts the sunglasses on him and walks him around.
What's the name of the good looking one?
I think Cooper
Oh yeah. Bradley Cooper.
The end is great.
Yeah they find the pictures on the camera.
It was insane.
I want to go to vegas.
Let's go this summer.
