Have you heard the new Chris Tomlin song "All My Fountains"?
Yes and I love our local Christian radio station, Joy FM.
Me too! Who are your favorite bands?
I love Need to Breathe, Switchfoot, Tobymac and Lauren Daigle.
Lauren Daigle has such a unique voice.
My favorite song of hers is "First."
That is a great one, and so is "Dry Bones."
Are you going to see Switchfoot when they come to play at Six Flags?
Yes I've got tickets already and I won the autographed cariacture!
Lucky! I have tickets too and I can't wait.
Their drummer, Chad Butler, is so handsome.
I know! There is a new song out called "Bulletproof." Have you heard it?
Yes, it's by Citizen Way. It's a very unique song!
Yes, it's almost like a disco song!
What about that song by King & Country, "Fix My Eyes?"
Oh my gosh, that's one of my favorites right now. I love the bass lines.
Well, if you like bass lines, you need to listen to some Superchick.
Who is Superchick?
They are a band from several years ago. The lead singers and the drummer are all sisters, but their bass player is incredible.
I'll have to check them out!
