Do you like early or late Beatles better?
Late Beatles, definitely.
Same here. It's amazing how much they grew as songwriters.
Especially considering they were marketed as a kind of teen pop band.
Even then they were very talented, though. They wrote everything themselves.
Which is more than can be said for pop groups today.
And they played they're own instruments. Including live!
I remember their live harmonies are really good, actually.
They were always talented, they just needed the chance to show it.
The Beatles discography is an amazing journey in itself, really.
