Are you excited to see the new Cars 3 movie?
I'm looking forward to it.
I really hope that it is a good one.
Sometimes these sequels don't live up to the hype.
I hope Lightening McQueen, Mater, and Sally, and the rest of the gang are in it.
Me too, it would be a shame if they weren't.
I missed Sally in the 2nd movie.  Didn't seem right she was only in a few scenes.
I know, I felt the same way.  She was a huge part of the first movie, seemed a shame to not bring her back strong in the 2nd.
You'll have to tell me how you like the new one.
Definitely, and you too.
