You know how I love those rewards programs they have for things, like gas purchases and airline tickets?
Yes, you always tell me when you get something extra or save money.
Well, now I have a new rewards program I'm using- Disney Movies Rewards.
How do you get rewards for Disney movies?
If you buy eligible movies or theater tickets, you can enter it on the Disney website for points. You can use the points for special offers or rewards.
Do you buy that many movies or theater tickets?
YES. I have three kids. I buy the movies all the time to keep them quiet and entertain them, and I take them to the theatre for special weekend trips with their friends.
You're a really great parent.
My kids love Disney movies, and the new Cars 3 came out this week, so I took them to see it, and already started racking up points.
Maybe you can get some good offers and be able to save on future movies.
