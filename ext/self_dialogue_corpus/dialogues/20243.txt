Let's rent a movie tonight.  Any ideas?
Something funny?  Or maybe an intense foreign mystery?
Something in between.
Have you seen 'Life as a House'?
No.  Who is in that?
Kevin Kline, Kristen Scot Thomas and Hayden Christenson.
I remember that now.  It was very sad.
I was, but it was nice to see the father and son relationship evolve.
I absolutely love Kevin Kline.
He is a wonderful actor.
I wish he was in more film.
When I searched Netflix, only a few came up.
Try searching on Amazon Prime.
I will.  I think I looked for this and you had to pay for it.
Well, this one is worth the extra money.
That Hayden Christenson is really a good actor.
He was amazing in this.
He is a cutie, isn't he?!
Definitely.  Kevin Kline is too.
Let's see this one.
