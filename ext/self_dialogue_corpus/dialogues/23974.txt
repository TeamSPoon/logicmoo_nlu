Man, I wish I could find a movie like Superbad.
Superbad is great, have you tried any of Judd Apatow's movies?
Yeah, I've seen most of them and I'm a big fan. I want something fresh.
Got it. So a comedy with teens who get into trouble?
Yeah, that sounds about right.
Have you seen all of John Hughes' movies?
What has he done again?
Breakfast Club, 16 Candles, Pretty in Pink, Ferris Bueller's Day Off.
Yeah, I've seen all of those, I love his stuff.
Hmm...Let me think then.
I want to add that I'd rather watch something more current.
I just thought of the perfect movie for you.
What is it?
It's called DOPE.
What's it about?
It's like if Superbad took place in the hood.
When's it from? I haven't heard of it.
It came out in 2015. It's on Netflix right now.
Okay, but what's it about?
These nerdy, do gooder black high school students end up a secret club and get mixed up in a crime. A lot of hilarious debauchery follows.
