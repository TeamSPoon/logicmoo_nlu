What is your favorite football team?
I love the Pittsburgh Steelers what is your favorite team?
I like the Denver Broncos I was so upset when Manning retired, but he was at the age it wasn't worth the risk.
Yeah he was a little over the normal retirement age for football players, but he is still active in football.
I heard he was hired on by Riddell as an adviser that is pretty cool.  Who was your favorite retired football player?
I loved Troy Polamalu I even named my lizard after him I was so sad when he played his last game.
Hey he was the head and shoulders guy I loved those commercials.
Yeah he did a lot of those commercials but he was the Safety for the Steelers. One of the best safety's there was.
What is he up to since he retired?
He writes movie reviews on his twitter but he was in the new Disney movie Moana, was cast as man one.
Wow football player turned actor that's interesting.
No he's not an actor he even said that in a recent interview, he just had fun saying his line in the movie.
Sounds like both our favorite retired players are having a great retirement. Are you excited for preseason to start?
I'm super excited I think the Steelers picked some great players this draft. We picked up TJ Watts, JJ watts brother.
That is a great pick I'm sure he will give the Steelers a lot of wins this season.
Who was the best player you think the Broncos drafted?
I think Garett Bolles was a great pick we really needed a new offensive tackle.
I haven't looked at his stats but I'm sure he'll do great in Denver.
Yeah I think both our teams will have a great preseason and regular season.
Hope both our teams make the play-offs.
