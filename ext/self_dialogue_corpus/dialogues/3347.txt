Debate time, horror movie edition.
Okay, go ahead.
Evil Dead 2: Remake or sequel?
That's so easy it's insane.
I say remake, it's practically scene-by-scene
And the graphics are better, maybe it's like the new editions like George Lucas did?
Right!
Wrong, very wrong.
What makes you so sure?
Different cast. Only Ash remains--it can't be a remake with different characters, silly.
