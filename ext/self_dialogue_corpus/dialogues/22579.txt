I know this is cheesy, but I have always been a sucker for romantic comedies.
I know how you feel.  They just make you feel good.  They make you laugh and cry all at the same time.
I have always liked when Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan pair up.  They have done such great movies.
Which ones are you talking about?
Well, there's" Sleepless in Seatle", ""You've got Mail and the one I really kind of like is "Joe Versus the Volcano".  I'm sure there are some other ones I can't remember.
I have never heard of "Joe Versus the Volcano".
It's pretty funny, and I can't really tell why it didn't do well in the theaters.  I don't even remember it being in the theaters.  We bought the DVD for it.
I also like when Julia Roberts does a romantic comedy.
Oh yes.  My absolute favorite is "Notting Hill."
That's a great movie.  I cried when she said to Hugh Grant, "I'm just a girl, standing here, asking a boy to love her."  Makes me cry every time.
Another good team for romantic comedies is Drew Barrymore and Adam Sandler.
I just loved "Wedding Singer", and my husband really likes "50 First Dates".
Does your husband like romantic comedies?
I would say at least as much, or maybe more than I do.
That's great.  They are fun to watch together.
I know, and he always expects me to cry at some point.  It's just what I do.
Are there any other good romantic comedies coming out that you know about?
I really don't know.  I'd have to look.
I think it's time for a date night with my husband.  Dinner and a romantic comedy.  What a great way to spend the evening.
I agree.  Let me know how it goes.  Maybe I can convince my husband to do the same.
