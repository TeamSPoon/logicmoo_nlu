I know I'm not in his target age group, but I really like Ed Sheeran's music
Believe it or not, so do I. How old is he anyways?
I think he's only 26 or so.
Wow. I first heard him do A Team. That seems so long ago.
That first album was certified platinum.
Yeah and then he was on Taylor Swift's Red album.
Wasn't he her opening act on tour?
He was and I think he won a couple of Grammy's that year.
He's definitely no longer an opening act for anyone.
Agreed. Do you remember when he sang with Sir Elton at the Grammys?
Of course I remember.  They were awesome together.
What are your favorite Sheeran albums?
Well, I really liked x.
Thinking Out Loud was on that album wasn't it?
It was. He won song of the year and best pop solo artist that year.
What Sheeran song are you into now?
I'm addicted to the Shape of You, though I have to be careful singing it near the kids
It really is catchy.
Did you see him on Carpool Karaoke with James Corden?
I did. I was cracking up laughing, Love that show. and Ed's a good sport.
