Star Wars, the original, had a lot of ground-breaking special effects.
Yes, it was a real feast for the eyes.
It deserved all those craft Oscars it won.
Too bad that was back in the day when the Academy never took scii-fi seriously enough to give it a Best Picture Oscar.
Maybe the Academy was still ticked off that George Lucas refused to put any credits at the beginning like the Academy wanted.
That was a really big deal back then, wasn't it? Like Lucas broke some kind of sacred Academy rule?
I think so. They had such a row that Lucas resigned from the Academy.
Not a good look for the Academy, chasing away a premier filmmaker of the day.
The Academy has always been pretty stuffy and stodgy. Hard to get new blood in there.
Things seem to be changing nowadays, with novel wins for unusual projects. They still need to recognize more sci-fi though.
