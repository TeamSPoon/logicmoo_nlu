What do you think of the new Drake album?
You mean More Life? I have only heard "Fake Love" on my car radio on the way to work.
What did you think of it?
I liked it. Is the rest of the album as catchy?
Yes, Drake uses a lot of house beats.
That sounds interesting.
It sounds cool, but some have complained that Drake is appropriating Dancehall.
You can argue he was just inspired.
Is it true he uses a fake accent?
Yes, I suppose that part is a bit problematic. But over all, the music sounds good.
Speaking of the car radio, have you heard of "Goosebumps"?
Yes, but I don't like it very much. Isn't it by Kendrick Lamar?
It's by Travis Scott but Kendrick Lamar features in it.
Kendrick's part in the song sounds very silly.
What do you mean?
He reuses the same melody in two of his other songs.
Hey, I have noticed that too. I wonder why?
Me too. He's talented, but he's made some very questionable music.
You can't blame an artist for their worst songs, I suppose.
I guess you're right. Let's celebrate them for their hits.
