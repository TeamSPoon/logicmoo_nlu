I have gotten really into like period piece thrillers.
Set in olden times?
Yes. Like the Prestige.
With Christian Bale?
Yes, and the magic and mystery.
I like when Hugh Jackman is trying to keep up with his rival.
When Alfred Borden seems to make himself teleport?
Yes. But there was a twist.
He had a secret twin!
But Angier did not know, and ended up making weird clones of himself.
