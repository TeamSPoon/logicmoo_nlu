Alice in Wonderland is so weird.
I love that movie. The Mad Hatter is the best.
I like the Mad Hatter, but my favorite characters are the twins.
Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum?
Yeah, those two.
Why?
They're hilarious. I love the noise they make when they bump in to each other.
They're interesting. I still like the Mad Hatter the most.
The Mad Hatter is crazy and weird.
That's the whole point.
