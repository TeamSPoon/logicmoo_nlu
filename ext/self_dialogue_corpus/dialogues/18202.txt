What do you think of Blink -182
I am not sure who they are? Can you give me a description?
Of course, they an American punk rock band. They have been around for about 20 years.
I'm still not sure who they are. Can you tell me some of their songs?
They have a ton of songs. But you would probably have heard of All the Small Things.
Oh that's them? I love that song!
Yes, That's Blink-182. They are a really great band and they put on amazing concerts live!
Really? Do you know if they are currently touring?
Yes, They are! They recently came out with a new album called California and they are touring all over the country this summer.
That's cool! I may have to check them out. I mean I do like that song.
You deffinetaly should. They have a new lead singer so the sound is a tad different than all the small things and that is one of their more lighters songs. But you should!
Okay, I will! Are you going to any of their upcoming concerts?
Yes, I went last summer and I am going to another one this summer! i am super exicted!
That should be fun! How many times have you seen them in total?
I have seen them about 5 times total. But I really like then new album so when ever I can I try to make it to the current tour
Thats really cool! I just added a playlist of theirs onto my spotify account so I can start listening to them too!
Thats great! I know that you will really like them!
I trust your opinion maybe I can come with you to a concert sometime?
I would love to have you come! The more the merrier!
I am so happy that you introduced me to them!  I am listentin right now and they are really good!
