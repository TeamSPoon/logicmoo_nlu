What do you think of when you hear country music?
It reminds me of growing up on the farm.
What else do you think of?
I think of summertime, being out at the lake with good friends.
Do you prefer old or new country?
I like both and listen to both.
What does rap make you think of?
Nothing in particular, I listen to the lyrics mainly if it is a good artist.
Yeah, most the time the good artists rap about what they know.
I agree, mainly about their lives and what they have been through.
Country reminds me of sunshine, being outside out in the woods.
It also makes me think of fishing, as a lot of country talks about fishing.
I think country music has a good message.
I also think so, some people stereotype it though.
I do not think those people really give the music a chance.
Do you listen to deathmetal?
I do not, I can't understand what they are saying when they scream!
I can't either, I also do not think much of deathmetal.
It is too hardcore for me, I like simpler rock and roll.
Can't go wrong with good old rock and roll!
