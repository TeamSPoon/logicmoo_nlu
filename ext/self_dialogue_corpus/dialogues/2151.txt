Hey man
Yo whats up my main man
What kind of offense do you like
depends
On what?
What you want to do on offense
Like
If you want to control the ball you run it.
Bang it up the middle all day long/
If you like scoring then you run the spread offense and throw it all day long
But you need a good QB for that
Yes you do
Someone who makes good decisions or you'll never go anywhere
Brady is the best at that
Yup
You don't need to run the ball with him at all
But they always catch everyone off guard when they do
Watch the patriots go to crap though when he retires
If he does
Yup. He keeps playing at that level he'll be 50 when he does
