Did you see the Force awakens yet?
Is that the one with Rey in it?
Yes, and John Boyega.
Who's Jon Boyega?
Boyega plays the storm trooper who doesn't want to kill anymore.
Oh yeah, he's the guy following Rey halfway around the universe.
That's right and Luke is in it but only in the last minute.
It's been so long I forgot half the movie.
You remember, Harrison Ford dies.
Yeah, you mean Han not the actor?
