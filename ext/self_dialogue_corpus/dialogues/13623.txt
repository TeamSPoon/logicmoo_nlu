I just watched The Revenge of the Sith.
Definitely the best of the prequels.
Seeing Darth Vader emerge for the first time was definitely a great moment.
I can't understand why Yoda gave up on the Emperor though.  It looked like me might have been stronger.
It had nothing to do with strength.  It was because Palpatine had the high ground and Yoda couldn't defeat him.
I can see that.  Basically the opposite of Anikan and Obi Wan.
Yes, now you got it.  Even though Ani is stronger Obi Wan had the better position.
You know what else I liked?  How they really played the fall of Vader to be more tragic than betrayal.
That's the genius of Star Wars.
For sure, great plot writing to go along with the effects.
