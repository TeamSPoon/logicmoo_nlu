You know what's interesting? Superheroes.
Not particularly. All major cultures have long running myths about superhumans doing good for the mankind.
Like what?
Liker Gilgamesh, the hero of the old world. And Greek mythology? There are tons of examples, not just in western civilization but from eastern ones also
Well I can't think of any eastern ones.
Most of Asian origin stories include a being that they considered to be superhuman, and he began their civilization.
See then, now, it's even more interesting.
How so? I just explained the origin of western superheroes in terms of historical facts.
That's what makes it interesting. Like it didn't all of sudden began in the US with Superman.
Superman is too new to be the beginning of superhero movies. The word superhero was first used in 1917.
