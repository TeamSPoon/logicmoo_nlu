Are you a fan of thrash metal?
Of course. My favorite thrash band is Anthrax.
One of the Big 4. Not bad.
How about yours?
Mine is Slayer. They're just untouchable.
Hard to argue with that.
I love all of the Big 4, but I feel like newer bands don't get enough credit.
Because they aren't as good.
That's immediately not true.
Really? Name 4 good newer thrash bands.
Alright. There's Havok, Power Trip, Vektor, and Revocation.
I've never heard of any of those.
Well, you need to check them out, especially if you consider yourself a thrash fan.
Alright then. Anyone else?
Well, if they were still active, As I Lay Dying might be in contention for best new thrash band.
Aren't they a metalcore band?
For the most part, they are. They infused a lot of thrash into their music, though.
I find that hard to believe.
Listen to Within Destruction. You'd be surprised by how it sounds.
I'll add those to my watch list.
