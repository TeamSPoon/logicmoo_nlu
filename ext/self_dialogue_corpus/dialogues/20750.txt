Do you like horror movies?
I do, but only if they're not gory. I can't stand looking at guts and blood. It grosses me out.
Have you seen "When a Stranger Calls"?
Yes, with Camilla Belle as the babysitter?
Yes. There's another version that was made first, in 1979.
Oh really? I haven't seen that one.
I have, but I prefer the 2006 film with Camilla more.
I was so freaked out the entire movie. I thought the kids were goners.
It's rare that horror movie Directors kill off children. They were just upstairs sleeping.
It was good that they didn't show the children until the end. It made you cling to your seat.
What'd you think about what happened to the Housekeeper?
That was crazy! She was positioned under the deck in the pond!
Yes, so creepy. I knew something would happen in that room. Why else would there be birds and a pond INSIDE the house?
That's true. I was frustrated because I felt like the Police weren't very helpful.
They weren't helpful at all! You'd think after she called so much they would physically come to check on her!
Maybe it was because of the bad weather?
I don't think so. It was raining and it was windy, but come on, they could've checked on her.
True. How did you feel the Director handled the killer's character?
I like that they didn't really show his face. It made it creepier.
I think so too, but I hated that we didn't really know who he was. The ending was unsettled.
