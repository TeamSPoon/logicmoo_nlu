Have you noticed all the colorful leggings at the lake?
Yeah. It's like all at once everybody suddenly got tired of black tights.
I liked throwing on my black leggings and going for a run. I didn't have to think about it.
Yeah, I see your point. But buying new exercise wear can be motivating too.
Yeah. You notice how good you look from all that exercise.
I'm not just exercising to look good. It's good for me!
Sure. Of course. But it's nice to look good too.
Yeah, you're right. And I guess leggings with a pattern would distract people from noticing some of my lumps and bumps too.
Yeah. Fabletics and Amazon both have leggings with absolutely blinding patterns.
Of course, some patterns actually make you look wider. Like horizontal stripes.
You're joking? They actually sell those?
Yeah. I don't know who buys them.
Blind people, maybe.
Really, really skinny blind people.
And of course compression leggings hold you in really well.
They do. I'm going to wear compression leggings with polka dots, once I lose five more  pounds.
You look fine now.
Maybe in leggings I do.
We both do. We're the queens of the lake.
Coming soon in brilliant living color.
