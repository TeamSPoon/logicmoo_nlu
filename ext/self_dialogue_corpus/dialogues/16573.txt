What annoys you the most in music?
Commercial or classical?
Commercial.
Hmm, I hate the over-sexualization of teenage girls, or those who look it.
Like whom?
Ariana Grande, Demi Lovato, Britney and Christina back in the day.
So what if people find them sexy? As long as they're talented singers.
Well, it brings unwanted attention to them and their bodies before they should have it.
Fine.
What's yours?
I absolutely hate the Picardy Third.
What is that? This sounds technical.
It's when a composer writes a piece entirely in minor, but ends the final chord in major instead.
Why does that bug you? Seems like it's a happy ending.
Because it takes a beautiful piece of music that's supposed to be sad, and ruins it at the very last second.
True, but it's probably historically important.
A bit. They used them back in the day to set up pairs of pieces that go together.
So on their own they sound awful, but they make sense in a larger context?
Yup.
Sounds like how all of life works!
