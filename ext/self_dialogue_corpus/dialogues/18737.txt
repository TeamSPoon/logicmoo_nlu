What is your favorite song from the 2000s?
That's easy, Crazy in Love by Beyonc√© featuring Jay Z.
With all due respect, that's such a conventional choice.
I'm sorry, but the includes the best singer and the best rapper of that decade. Also, it's my go to karaoke song.
I just think that it's not even their best song together. I much prefer Deja Vu or even '03 Bonnie & Clyde.
Both of those are also great songs. What is your favorite song of the 2000s?
Yeah by Usher. It is the best dance song ever released in my opinion.
It's hard to argue with that. I am a huge fan of Lil Jon and find him to be one of the most talented hip hop producers of that period.
His music could be very dirty, but no one had a better understanding of music that could play in the club than him.
Agreed. I will always associate the song Get Low with that period of time.
Yeah, the 2000s had some amazing dance music. Do you remember Missy Elliot?
Of course! Work It felt like the biggest song in the world when it came out.
I especially liked her work with Ciara. You know, songs like 1, 2 Step and Lose Control.
I remember those songs well. Missy Elliot was the Nicki Minaj of her day.
Don't make me pick between the two! While I think Nicki Minaj is probably the better rapper, Missy Elliot was way better at making dance music.
That assessment seems fair. However, Missy Elliot was able to make such good dance music because she had Timbaland as her producer.
I totally forgot about that guy. That guy was in just about every Justin Timberlake song during the 2000s.
I didn't mind that at all. The played a pivotal role in making FutureSex/LoveSounds, which is my favorite pop album of the decade.
That was a great album, but I still prefer Gwen Stefani's album Love. Angel. Music. Baby.
That's a good album, but I heard Hollaback Girl way too much to ever want to listen to it again.
