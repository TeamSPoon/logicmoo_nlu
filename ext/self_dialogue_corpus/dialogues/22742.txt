Are you into comedy movies?
Of course! Do you have any in mind?
Well, have you heard of the movie Strange Wilderness?
No, I have not.
Are you interested in hearing what it is about?
Yeah sure, tell me.
Basically, its a comedy about a guy who runs a nature T.V. show.
Sounds funny, what do they do?
They go looking for Sasquatch haha.
Wow, haha, do they find him?
Yeah they do, and when they find him they accidentally shoot him to death.
Oh my god, that's hilarious.
But what is really funny is the things they do on the journey to finding Sasquatch.
What do they do?
Well just simple dumb stuff like recording a caterpillar.
Haha, that sounds like a really funny movie.
I definitely recommend checking it out.
Would it be okay to watch with kids?
Probably not, because there is some drug use in the movie.
Oh, makes sense. I won't be watching it with my kids then.
