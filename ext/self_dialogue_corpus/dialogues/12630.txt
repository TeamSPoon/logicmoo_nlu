Lightsaber or blaster, what would you choose?
Lightsaber
I would go with a blaster
But a lightsaber could deflect a blaster
Yeah, but you need Jedi skills do use a lightsaber
But Finn used a lightsaber without being a Jedi
I don't remember that
And Han Solo used one in the snow world to cut open that one animal thing
Oh yeah, I remember that one
So I guess a lightsaber is better
