Did Derek Carr deserve his deal?
The Raiders will be loving that deal sooner than later.
How so?
Once Wentz and Prescott have to get paid itll look like a steal
That could be said for any quarterback though.
Like Brady?
Or even Brees and Roethlisberger.
Thats strange.
The market has set out a specific number for a franchise QB.
Yeah you dont see most of them hit free agency
Not at all, you see Mike Glennon and Josh McCown but thats because they are backups only.
I cant believe Chicago gave that money to Glennon.
Yeah its funny money you pay in free agency when you cant draft well.
They took Trubisky for some odd reason.
They throw a ton of QB slop against a wall to see what sticks
Is Cutler still with them
No they cut him obviously
Did he sign with anyone?
No his career is all but over
He made alot of money for doing very little
