Hey are you a hockey fan at all?
Kind of, but I don't watch much.
We're in Boston, you gotta love the Bruins!
Yeah I do always root for my city's teams.
Have you ever been to a game?
Not a Bruins game, but I have been to a live hockey game. I won tickets once.
Sweet! To what game?
It was a local game- Manchester Monarchs.
ah cool, a buddy of mine played for them out of college!
Cool! What's he doing now?
Not sure, but I know his life goal is to play for the NHL.
The Bruins!? That'd be sweet.
I think he tried out. I know he's meet Tuuka Rask.
What that's crazy!
Yeah, but I'm not sure if he met him on the ice, might have been at a bar.
Either way that's sweet.
I do get a discount on tickets through work if you ever wanna go.
It's something I'd like to see! I live by the Garden.
Cool. Give me your email and I'll let you know when I can get a discount.
Sounds good!
