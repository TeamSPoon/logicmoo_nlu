I really want to see The Babadook.
Really? It just looks okay, to be honest.
Yeah, but I want to see it because it's pride month and apparently The Babadook is an LGBT horror movie.
What? How does that even exist?
Apparently there's some kind of underlying plot points which a lot of gay people familiarize with.
For some reason I feel like the Babadook might be a monster coming out of the closet.
No no, I don't think i will be that easy. I do know however that the Babadook does have jazz hands and a top hat.
It does sound kind of good, and gay people tend to have good taste. There aren't a lot of gay horror movies, I think maybe Martyrs is the only other one I've seen.
Martyrs? What's that about?
Oh it's crazy. Probably one of the goriest movies I've ever seen. They literally skin a girl alive and  only leave the face.
