Do you like hair bands?
Hair bands as in 80s hair bands?
Yes.
Not particularly.
Oh man, I think they're the greatest.
Really? How so?
Some of the most classic songs come from that era.
Like what?
Anything by Poison, Def Leppard, Bon Jovi...you name it.
Umm...some of those are okay, but some are pretty lame.
No way man. Living on a Prayer?
Yeah, that song  is pretty good.
And what about Pour Some Sugar On Me?
Yeah, I like that one too.
And Talk Dirty To Me.
Oh yeah that one is good too.
So don't you agree hair bands are great?
Well, maybe. I still think there was some bad ones out there.
Yes, there's always some bad tracks.
And always some good tracks.
