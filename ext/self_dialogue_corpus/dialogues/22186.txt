Have you seen LaLa Land?
I did see LaLa Land!
Did you enjoy it? I know a lot of people were saying negative things during and after the Oscars. It was crazy.
I agree, that was pretty crazy. Yes, I did enjoy LaLa Land. I liked Moonlight too, though, and I'm glad it won at the Oscars.
Yeah, I thought Moonlight was a really good movie, too.
What was your favorite part of LaLa Land?
I really liked the opening scene, actually!
I thought the opening scene was great, too.
Yeah, it really reminded me of scenes in, some of the Broadway musicals I've seen.
I can definitely see that! I thought it was very theatrical, as well, though.
It was very theatrical, I agree. Are there any other movies you've seen in the last year that you thought were good?
Actually, I recently saw Colossal and I thought that movie was good.
I think I've heard of that movie but I can't remember what it's about.
It is basically about a girl who finds out that she is accidentally controlling this godzilla-type monster that keeps attacking Korea.
Wow, that sounds really funny and interesting, maybe a little weird. Who is in that movie again?
Anne Hathaway plays the main character in the movie.
I love Anne Hathaway!
I really like her too.
Jason Sudeikis was also in colossal.
I love him too! He is so funny!
