I wonder what Disney movies will be released on dvd this year?
Oh, you mean the ones that are from the vault?
Yes, I try to purchase them as soon as they come out.
Well, let me grab my phone and do some googling for you.
Thank you so much for doing this.
It seems the latest release was Bambi and it was two weeks ago.
I haven't gotten that one, yet.  I think I need to go to the store now.
Yes, that is all the vault releases for this year.  In January, Pinocchio was released.
Yes, I have that one.
Then, it seems you are all caught up for the year as soon as you get Bambi.
