Did you know the entire Harry Potter cast was British?
Well not all all. You know Verne Troyer who played Griphook, is an American.
Okay well all the major characters.
I heard the Duke Humphreys library where the library scenes were filmed, strictly forbids flames in the library and made an exception for the movie! First time in hundreds of years!
Yeah, well they probably got enough cash to store a whole section of old out of print books!
It would have been pretty cool to work on the set. Of course, castles are plentiful in Britain.
Yeah, the locations were amazing. I love seeing the inside of Hogwarts. It was much more vivid after seeing the movies.
Yeah, they were pretty close to what I imagined in my head.
Me too. It's still hard to believe the first movie was done in 2001!
I know right! That was 16 years ago!
