What was that movie with Haley Joel Osment and Bruce Willis?
The one where he sees dead people?
Yeah, that one.
The 6th Sense, I think.
Oh, yeah, I don't know how I forgot that.
Did you like that one?
Yeah, I just haven't seen it in a while.
That was a big hit for that boy, right?
Oh, sure.  He probably made a ton.
I don't think he even acts anymore.
