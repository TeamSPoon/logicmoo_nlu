Hey man, how are you?
Quite well, just got back from an Umphrey's McGee show. Those guys are awesome.
Who?
They're a jam band that plays a lot of progressive rock. You've never heard of them?
No, I haven't. Tell me more about them.
Well they tour a whole lot and they have a great sound and an amazing light show.
Light show? Like Pretty Lights?
No man, not at all. They actually play instruments.
Do they play them well?
Of course! They're rock stars.
I'll have to check them out.
You really should. They're my favorite band.
What other music do you like?
I'm really into the Grateful Dead. What about you?
I love indie rock. My favorite band is Arcade Fire.
They're the ones that did that song "Reflektor" right?
Yeah, that was on their newest album. I prefer their old stuff though.
What's your favorite song of theirs?
I know it's cliche, but "Wake Up" is an amazing tune.
I know that one!
