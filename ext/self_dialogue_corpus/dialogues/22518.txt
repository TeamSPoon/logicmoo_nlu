Have you been to the movies lately?
Not for a few months. It is getting so expensive to watch in theaters.
I know! I'd rather just wait until I can get them on Netflix or on demand for a few dollars.
Me too. My last one was La La Land, but it was $5 movie night.
How was that? It really cleaned up at the Oscars.
It was great. It kind of started out a little corny, but once it went on I really liked it.
Yeah, it is interesting that they are bringing back more traditional musicals.
It seems to be working.
Althought Ryan Gossling and Emma Stone are no Fred and Ginger.
No, definitely not. But they were pretty good.
I just can't see them in that type of musical role.
I liked them fine, but I probably wouldn't have minded someone else.
Could they actually sing?
I'm sure it was highly autotuned for the movie, but they were okay.
They need someone like Mandy Moore! She has such a great voice and was amazing in A Walk to Remember.
I lover her too, but I'm not sure if she would have been right for the La La Land part.
Why not?
She's a little too serious and conventional. The role seemed to need something more quirky.
Interesting. I guess it was probably fun to bring Ryan and Emma back togther for another movie.
They definitely have an undeniable chemistry.
