Hello,  how have you been?
Not too bad...and you?
Doing well.  Got any good news?!
Not really...but I saw an outstanding movie yesterday?
Oh really?  Which one?
Table 19.
Oh, I think I saw the trailer for that on youtube!
Yea, that's how I first heard about it!
So what made it so enjoyable?
For starters, I love Anna Kendrick.
Me too!
The movie itself also have a great supporting cast and was heartwarming and funny!
Who else was in it?
Well, Stephen Merchant for one thing.
Yea, he's excellent!
Sure is!  He was great in the movie.
Sweet.  So what other movies would you compare it to?
It was a wedding comedy so maybe Wedding Crashers...and a bit like the Breakfast Club in places!
Dang.  That's high praise!
Yes, you really have to see it!
