Hey did you see that movie Zootopia?
No, what is Zootopia?  Wasn't it some cartoon?
It's not a cartoon, it's like an animated film for both kids and adults!  It was great!
I do remember my kids talking about it.  So it was enjoyable for you, too?
Oh, totally!  The characters are hilarious and it has some really memorable scenes.
I love it when movies are made for the whole family.
Yeah, me too.  There's this one scene with sloths that is completely hilarious.
So it's worth renting?
Yes, it's perfect for a family movie night.  I love the computer graphics in it, too.
I will definitely put that on our list of movies to rent.  I know I had seen the trailers but I kept forgetting about it.
Just be on the lookout for the sloth scene, you'll know what I mean.
It seems like they are coming out with animated films lately that are even better than acted films!
I know!  It's really come along way.
The graphics are amazing and they can do so much action related stuff that can't be done with real humans.
I know, it's amazing what they can do with the technology.
For real.  Plus, I like seeing animals acting, it's always so funny.
Yes it is, and it's neat when famous actors and actresses are doing the voices.
Yes, true.  Well we will be sure to rent Zootopia next family movie night, possibly tonight!
You should, I am sure that you will all enjoy it.
Thanks for the recommendation.
