As hard as I try, I just can't get into rap music.
Really? There are so many awesome rappers out there like Nas, Andre 30 and Dr. Dre.
One of the biggest issues for me is that so many raps songs have profanity.
That's because the lyrics are telling a story.
I get that, but I don't think they need to swear.
Is that the only thing that bothers you about rap music?
I also found that the music isn't good  A  lot of the time and they'll take the same few notes and play them over and over again.
Rapping isn't so much about the music, but about the actual rapping.
But without good music, I'm not entertained.
OK. I understand why you don't like rap now.
