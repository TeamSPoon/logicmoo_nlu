Do you think Bob Dylan was great?
I loved Forever Young
Speaking of, Rod Stewart did a great version of that song
There have been many covers of it that were great.
I love covers
Its important when they really make it their own song.
Have you ever heard the cover of Rod Stewart's forever young?
I heard one by a band called So They Say
Yeah thats the one I am talking about
It was awesome the way they made it more aggressive.
I agree with that.
How about Elton John?
He wrote some real jams
Rocketman was such a tear jerker
The same could be said for Candle in the Wind.
Cant forget about Billy Joel either
He wrote a ton of hits!
What is your favorite by him?
We didnt start the fire is probably his finest work
I think it was Piano Man
