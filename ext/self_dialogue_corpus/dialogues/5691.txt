What's your favourite Disney movie?
Hmmm, it's hard to pick. Maybe Mulan?
Mulan is my favourite Disney Princess for sure but I don't know if it's the best movie they've ever made.
What would you pick?
I think probably Moana.
Eh, I'm not such a fan of the newer 3D ones.
Yeah but Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson, come on.
He was in it?
Yeah, he's like the second main character.
Huh. Maybe I'll give it a go then.
