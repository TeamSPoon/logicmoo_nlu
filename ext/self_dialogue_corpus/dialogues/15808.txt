Hey, what are you listening to?
Oh, just some Slim Shady
Marshal Mathers?
Yea, that's his real name
That guy used to be on fire
Yea, he definitely was!
What ever happened to him?
I dont know.  Maybe he became a family man?
Yea, he did always talk aobut his daughter.  Maybe he went back to be a better father
I'd hope so.  Have you ever heard the lyrics to his albums?
Yea, they're all about how he has drama with is family
Exactly.  I'm hoping he fixed that with all this time of
Yea, but it would be nice if he released something soon
Yea, his daughter is all grown up now so maybe he will soon
Oh is she?
Yea google her.  She's much older than from his first album
Is she hot?
Damn hot!
Wow, I'll look her up
