What is your all time favorite Disney movie?
That's a tough one. Of the older ones, I'd have to say the Aristocats.
I loved that one too, but I'd pick The Jungle Book.
Both of those have great music. What about more recent movies?
I love all the Pirates of the Caribbean movies, and Frozen and Moana were both must sees too.
And Finding Dory. I was surprised by that one.
I was too! I really didn't expect to like it.
Ellen DeGeneres is great.
And the plot was good too. I was really afraid it was going to be a bad knockoff, but it was fresh.
Yes. I'd even watch it again.
