Hey, did you know there's a new Wreck-it_Ralph movie coming out?
Really? When is it coming out?
It should be coming out November of next year.
Do you know what it's going to be about?
You know how the premise of the last movie was Ralph traveling into other game worlds?
Yeah, is the next movie going to be something like that again?
In a way, only this time it will be Ralph traveling through the Internet.
Woah, I wonder how's that going to turn out?
We'll see when the first trailer come out.
Ugh, it feels so far away!
