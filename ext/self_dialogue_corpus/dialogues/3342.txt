What do you think about Romantic Horror movies?
I do not even think I know of any.
Sure you do. Like, warm bodies.
With the Zombies?
Yes, it is like a love story but also super filled with horror.
Don't they all just die.
No, they slowly come back to life.
How?
With love! It is equal parts scary and sweet.
I might check that one out then.
