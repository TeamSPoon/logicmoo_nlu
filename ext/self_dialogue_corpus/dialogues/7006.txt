Do you remember when Lion King was made?
I'm not exactly sure but I think it came out in 1994.
You're probably right. Can't believe it's been that long!
I know! Makes me feel old.
Another one I watched regularly as a kid was Aladdin.
Oh I loved that one also, so good.
Did you enjoy the Return of Jafar too?
I did but it was not as good as the original.
You're right, I prefer the original too but I did enjoy Robin Williams voice in those movies.
I really did too! His character was perfect.
