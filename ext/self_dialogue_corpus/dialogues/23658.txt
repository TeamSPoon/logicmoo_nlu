Did you like Ben Affleck in the new Batman
I did not think it was all that bad.
Yeah he wasnt as bad as Val Kilmer.
Or as campy as George Clooney.
Christian Bale really nailed the role.
I agree with you he was probably the best.
Michael Keaton did a great job too.
Yeah but back to Affleck.
I think he might direct the next one.
They are re-doing the franchise again?
I mean dont they always?
He is the 6th one to play the role.
This is why DC needs to stick with certain actors and let it play out over time.
Spiderman has been done what 4 times in the past 10 years?
Yeah but they were different studios that did it.
OK so they get a pass.
Affleck should play Batman just for continuity purposes
I agree with you but he needs some hero sidekicks to be there in multiple movies.
Like Aquaman?
Not many know who he is
