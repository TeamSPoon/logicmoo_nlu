What kind of music do you like?
I like all kinds of music, but mostly metal I think.
Why metal?
I like the guitar sounds a lot, it is very energetic and lively.
Lively is one way to put it. I don't like metal a lot.
Well you might've not heard the right bands then.
What are some good metal bands?
I wouldn't listen to any of the stuff that people are like, "Oh this is the heaviest band out there!"
Why not?
A lot of that heavy stuff just isn't very musical, at least most of what I've heard.
That's my main complaint actually, I don't usually hear a lot of music in the songs if you know what I mean.
Some bands are definitely like that. What about Metallica?
Some of their stuff I like.
Did you listen to the Kill 'Em All album?
Maybe, I'm not very familiar with them though.
Yeah listen to that album and Master of Puppets, both of those are very good.
Maybe if I'm in the mood I will.
Or if you don't want to listen to them at least listen to something lighter.
What's a lighter metal band?
Iron Maiden is like classic metal that never gets too heavy and is very melodic.
