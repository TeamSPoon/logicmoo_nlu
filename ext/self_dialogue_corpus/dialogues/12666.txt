Do you follow Star Wars?
Yes, I love those movies!
Did you see the most recent movie?
Was that Rogue 1?
Yes that's the one. It came out in 2016.
No!  I was so busy in December that I didn't have a chance to see it.
I think it will come out on video soon.
Yeah, I haven't seen it at redbox or Netflix yet.
You should definitely check it out when you have the chance. I loved it.
Good to know!  I will check it out.
