I'm impressed at the amount of merchandise that Star Wars has pumped out all these years.
I'm a pretty big fan of the video games.
Are you a fan of the films at all?
Not really, but I really like the way the lore has translated to video games. It fits extremely well.
I kind of agree. I just wish there was some more resemblance to the films.
So basically movie tie-in games?
Yeah, basically that. That's just me, though.
Movie tie-ins generally aren't very good, though.
Still, an Empire Strikes Back game never hurt anyone.
Maybe, but you might be disappointed after playing it.
