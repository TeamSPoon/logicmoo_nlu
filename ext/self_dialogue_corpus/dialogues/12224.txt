So what do you think Luke will be like in the Last Jedi?
I think he'll be very Yoda like.  All serious and stuff.
Yeah, I wish I saw more of him the The Force Awakens.
That would have been great.
He has to be, other than Vader, the most dynamic character in the franchise.
Yes, from cry baby about power converters to Jedi Knight.
I know, a galaxy famous one who destroyed the first Death Star.
And finally vanquished Darth Vader.
Yes, all the Skywalker's power must be almost unstoppable.
I know, I'm hoping to see some crazy things from him in the next movie.
