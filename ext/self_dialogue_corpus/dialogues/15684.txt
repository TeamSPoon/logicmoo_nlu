Have you ever heard of Billy Joel?
Um, yeah of course I've heard of him.
Okay, someone mentioned him at work the other day and I had no idea who they were talking about.
Are you kidding me?
No.
Man you must've been living under a rock for the past several decades.
Well I wasn't around much in the 80s since I was born in the 90s.
Haven't you heard of Uptown Girl and Piano Man
Those kind of sound familiar
They're two of his greatest hits. I'm sure you've heard them before.
Where is Billy Joel from?
I'm pretty sure he's from NYC
Ah okay. That's kind of cool.
Yeah, he's a big piano player/singer.
Ah I guess the ladies really like a good piano player
Yeah, he went out with major super models back in the day
Like who?
Elle Macpherson and Christie Brinkley are two of the more famous ones
Who are they?
Oh I can't take it anymore.
