Want to hear a joke?
Sure. Whatcha got?
It's a sad tale really...
Don't tell me it's about Jaba the Hut...
No, but close. It's about Luke Skywalker.
I love Star Wars jokes.  Let her rip..
Luke Skywalker and Obi Wan go to a chinese restaurant. But Luke was having a terrible time using the chopsticks..
Don't tell me that Luke was loosing his touch?
So Obi Won made a suggestion to help his apprentise. He said, "Use the fork Luke...use the fork."
I think I just spit up a litttle.
