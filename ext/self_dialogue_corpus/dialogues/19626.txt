Have you ever heard of Taking Back Sunday?
The band? I think so
What do you think of them?
I'm not a big fan to be honest.
Why not?
I don't like music that is in the the pop punk
They actually aren't very pop punk anymore
What kind of music do they play now then?
It actually sounds more rock and alternative now
Really? Are they on tour?
Yes, you should check them out and see for yourself!
I might do that. Are they coming to my city anytime soon?
Most likely. Check their website for the dates and info.
