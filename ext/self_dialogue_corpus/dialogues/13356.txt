Ok, I've got some Star Wars trivia for you, are you up for it?
You bet I am!
Ok, where are Ewoks from?
The Forest Moon of Endor, of course!
Darn, ok, here's a super hard question...what is the name of the Ewok Princess Leia befriends?
Um, Wicket Warrick?
Oh you are too good!  Yes, Wicket Warrick is his name, what was his main job?
He is the tribe leader.
Nope, he is a scout for the village!
Well, I did know  his name, and aren't those Ewoks super cute?!
