Have you see Day of the Dead?
Yeah, it was good.  Not as good as the first two movies though.
But it had it's fair points.
This one was more about people keeping going in the zombie world.
And learning how to use them.  Who could forget Bub.
Who shoot that guy at the end and salutes him.
Maybe the only time I liked a zombie.
Also a set up for the next movie.
I know, but it took forever for it to come out.
I know, and Land of the Dead wasn't as good.  But it served.
