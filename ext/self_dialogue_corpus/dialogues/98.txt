Have you seen Wonder Woman yet?
I still haven't seen it!
What's wrong with you?
I've just been too broke!  Movie tickets are like $20 in New York.
Come with me to Providence and we'll see it much cheaper.
Did you like it?
I loved it.  The opening with her and all the other women on the island was great.  Good cinematography.
They cast Wonder Woman really well.
Yeah, she was in one of the Fast and Furious movies.
Really?  I'd better check that out.
