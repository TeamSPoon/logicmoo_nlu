Can you believe they made another 'Pirates of the Caribbean' movie?
I had no idea they did that.
I mean it's hard to believe that they can even have a story to tell after five or six movies.
What is this new one called?
It's called 'Dead Men Tell No Tales.'
Who stars in it?
Johnny Depp is Jack Sparrow again.  Also reprising his role is Geoffrey Rush.
Anybody new?
Brenton Thwaites plays Henry Turner.  Will Turner's son.
I know who Breton is.  He was in 'Gods of Egypt.'
I didn't see that one.  That was the Egypt movie with no Egyptian actors in it, right?
That's correct.  I can't believe movie studios keep pulling stunts like that.
They had the Scottish Gerard Butler play an Egyptian god.  He didn't even hide his Scottish accent for the role.
That must have been a strange thing to watch...and listen to.
It was.  To be honest, Hollywood blockbusters have been letting me down in recent years.
Too many sequels and not enough depth.
I would rather watch an original movie with a low budget, than another multi-million dollar 'Pirates' sequel with a similar plot.
Maybe Indie films are something you should look into.
I've been watching them more frequently.  Netflix has a solid selection of them.
Amazon Prime video has a good selection of Independent films too.
