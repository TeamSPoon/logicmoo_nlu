Which is your favorite Harry Potter movie?
Hmm, out of 7, that's a tough choice.
It's out of eight; seven got split into two. Don't be silly.
Best overall experience or how it was adapted from the book?
Experience, of course. Books adapted into movies should run smoothly.
I like Harry Potter.
...and..?
...The one about Dumbledore's Army.
You really don't know the title? It's The Order of the Phoenix.
Oh yeah. That one.
So, why do you like it the most?
It's the first with a real dark turn to it. The Goblet of Fire killed the vampire guy but still felt a bit silly.
If by the Vampire guy you mean Cedric Diggory, then I got you, but it's a different movie. What was your favorite part of it?
I love the fight scene at the end. The music sounded a lot like Shostakovich's fugato from his 11th Symphony.
That's super specific, but cool. Yeah I liked it too but there was something wrong about it.
What's that?
Well, Harry was fighting without saying his spells out loud.
Why does that matter?
Well, at Hogwarts, they don't learn how to do that until the following year.
Maybe someone taught him, MuggleBreath. Ever think of that?
