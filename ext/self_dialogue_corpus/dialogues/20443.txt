What are you watching?
Pearl Harbor. Have you ever seen it?
No I haven't. Is it any good?
Oh it is a great movie. Do you typically like historical movies?
I do, I love the movie Titanic.
It is a lot like that. It tells the story of the great tragedy in American history but also incorporates a great love story.
Nice, who are the actors in it?
The movie highlights a love triangle. The main couple is played by Ben Affleck and Kate Beckinsale.
Who plays the third member of the love triangle?
Josh Hartnet. He is pretty good in it.
Sounds interesting. What happens in the movie between them?
Ben Affleck, who plays Rafe, goes away to war and while he is gone his best friend Danny falls in love with his girlfriend.
Wow that is intense!
Yeah. While Rafe is gone, Danny gets Rafe's girlfriend Evelyn pregnant.
What happens next?
Rafe comes home and then the attack happens. After that, Rafe and Danny both go to fight overseas and Danny dies. Rafe and Evelyn then raise Danny's baby.
Oh my goodness! That sounds like an emotional movie.
It is, have a seat and watch it with me if you would like.
Ok! Thank you.
Of course!
