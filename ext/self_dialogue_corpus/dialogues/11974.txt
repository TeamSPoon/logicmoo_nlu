Who do you like better, R2-D2 or BB-8?
Man that's a tough one!
You have to chose one or the other!
I will always love R2-D2, but as of right now, I like BB-8 more.
Why do you like BB-8 more?
I guess BB-8 has more of a personality than R2-D2.
I agree with you!
BB-8's interactions with everyone was hilarious.
My favorite part when when BB-8 gave Finn a thumbs up.
That was so cute!
