Do you have a favorite Will Smith action movie?
I have so many it's hard to pick just one.
I would have to say Independence Day is my all time favorite.
That is by far the highest grossing movie on his resume.
I could still watch it over and over till this day.
I think Bad Boys with Martin Lawrence might be my favorite.
Yeah that has to be one of the best buddy cop movies of all times.
Can forget the Men In Black movies.
Please i'm still waiting on the next MIB installment.
I would love to see a crossover movie with Men in Black and Guardians of the Galaxy. So epic!
