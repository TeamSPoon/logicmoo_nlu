I'm babysitting tonight. Whats a good Disney Movie
Is it a little girl or boy?
A little girl
Then I recommend The Little Mermaid
I've never seen it, what's it about?
It's about a mermaid who gives up her voice in exchange to be a human
Wow, what a great plot. Whats the year on it
1989
Isn't that a bit old?
It's getting up there in age, but it's a classic for all ages
