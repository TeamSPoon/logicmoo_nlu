How about Anderson Paak, huh? Is he talented or what?
God, I love him. He has a voice like no other.
Ever seen those live session videos online?
Yeah, those are such a treat to watch. He's really passionate about his work.
That's one of the things that makes him such a master.
He's done some stuff with Tokimonsta, too.
Ah, yes. Realla is absolutely brilliant. The video is gorgeous, too.
Not just Realla. Don't forget Put it Down.
Another great track. Which album is that one on?
Fovere. I think that's the latest one. They work together a lot, though. I'd expect to see more collaborations in the future.
