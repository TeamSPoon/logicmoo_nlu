Do you prefer The Little Mermaid or Beauty and the Beast?
I like Beauty and the Beast best, I think. I love the songs in it, and I wish I could have a library like the one Beast gives Belle.
That library is amazing. The ballroom scene is really good, too.
Do you like Beauty and the Beast better, too, then?
No, I like it a lot, but I actually prefer The Little Mermaid.
That's surprising! How come?
I think that everything in it is so pretty!
That's true. I like the "Under the Sea" scene a lot.
I even like the song that Ursula sings, "Poor Unfortunate Souls"
I like it too, but her and her eels always scared me!
