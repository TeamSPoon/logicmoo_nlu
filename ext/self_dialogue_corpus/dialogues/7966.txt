Do you like pop music?
Yeah, ever since Michael Jackson.
Totally, he's the King of Pop.
Yeah, shame he died the way he did though.
Yeah he had a lot of problems but still he was the King of Pop.
Did you see his last documentary about rehearsing for this concert?
Ah yeah, This is It.
Yeah he was totally going to play his classics, like Thriller and Beat It.
That is awesome, the music video for Thriller is such a classic.
So is the music video for Beat It. Think I'll watch it now!
