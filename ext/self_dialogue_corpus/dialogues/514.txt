Man can anyone beat the Patriots?
Sure! The New York Giants did it twice in the Superbowl.
I miss Peyton Manning, Football isn't the same without him.
I know, that man was a machine.
The AFC dominates, since I was little it's always been an AFC team that won the superbowl
Not true, there's been several NFC teams that have won in the past 15 years.
Troy Aikman is a good commentator
Yeah but he's not as good as Troy Aikman
Will the Falcons ever "rise up" again?
Maybe, but it's more likely they "sit down"
I avoid the half time shows during the superbowl
I used to, the one year I went out to get food the Janet Jackson fiasco happened
I feel bad for the Browns, they won't ever see a superbowl
They will if they keep getting the first round draft pick every year
The Seattle Seahawks have some ugly uniforms
It looks like a blind painter made them
As long as the shuttles are free (and plentiful) I see no problem with this. Just don't try to catch one 15 minutes before kickoff and expect to be in the stadium on time.
People turn up to games that close to kickoff? What's the point in going if you aren't planning on hitting at least a little tailgate?
Why don't more teams use the hurry-up offense?
I know, this kills the defense of the team using hurry up
