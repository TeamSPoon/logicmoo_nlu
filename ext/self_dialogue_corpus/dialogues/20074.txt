Have you seen Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 yet?
No I haven't was it a good movie?
Yeah it was great, a lot of action just like the first.
The first movie was great, I will definitely go see the second one.
You have to see it in 3D, it was a  much better experience than standard.
You went to see it twice?
Yeah, I could not help myself I saw the 3D and the standard versions. The 3D is much better.
I will be sure to see the 3D then.
Have you seen any other movies lately?
Not really, I like to stick to HBO and Cinemax for my movies.
Oh did you know HBO just came out with Suicide Squad?
Yeah, I saw it last night it was not as good as I thought it would be. Kind of dissapointing.
Really? I thought it was a great movie and had a lot of action.
What else have you seen recently other than Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.2?
I finally watched Star Wars for the first time last week.
What? I cannot believe that you had not watched it before. All the movies?
No just a couple, but Return of the Jedi was my favorite.
Yeah George Lucas did a great job with all of the movies honestly.
Not to mention Indiana Jones.
Yeah, don't get me started on Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, I love that movie.
