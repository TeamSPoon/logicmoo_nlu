Do you think Rey and Fin will end up together?
I mean, I guess there is always a chance.  I think the more important question is, "should they?"
Can you elaborate?
I just think that their dynamic in 'The Force Awakens' was great without the romance.  It could maybe detract from the story.
But they have so much chemistry.
True, but I would rather they focus on the hero's journey in itself rather than romantic entanglements.
I guess I see your point.  By the way, do you think Fin will be okay after the last movie?
I'm sure he will be, but he did get severely injured.
I wouldn't be surprised if his rehabilitation takes a while.
Good point.  He may be at a disadvantage physically during the second movie of the sequel trilogy.
