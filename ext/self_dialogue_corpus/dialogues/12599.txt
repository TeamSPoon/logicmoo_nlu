Is Rey related to Luke or not?
Hard to say.  I'm guessing we'll find out in the next movie.
It almost seems like she shouldn't be at this point.
So there's so much speculation she is that it might be a buzzkill to actually learn she is.
Blame the internet for that.  People share thoughts too easily.
I personally think we'll find that she isn't.
You don't think so?
The galaxy is a massive place.  Maybe she just has the force.
Or maybe everyone has the force, they just don't know how to use it.
That's a great thought and would make for an interesting roundtable discussion.
