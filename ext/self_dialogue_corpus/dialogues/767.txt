Hey pal, only 2 months till the NFL returns
I know I'm really excited.
What are you most excited for?
I liked the draft, I'm looking forward to seeing the new players.
Me too. My team got a steal.
Oh yeah,  who's your team?
I root for the chiefs.   I'm excited about the addition of patrick mahomes.
Yeah it will be interesting to see if he challenges Alex Smith at all.
I don't think he'll be more than a solid backup this first year.
You never know,  look at dak Prescott last year.
Yeah true,  he really helped the cowboys a lot.
I was surprised that kc let go of John Dorsey... I wonder what caused that.
I don't know either it's not like they haven't had success recently.
Yeah.   Who is your team?
Green bay.   I became a fan after they drafted jordy Nelson.  Loved him at kstate.
He really was a surprise,  glad to see him back after his knee injury 2 years ago.
Yep, he's an asset for sure.
I guess it isn't too surprising since he was coached by Bill Snyder.
Yeah the wizard can turn a good player into a great one.  Just like Tyler lockett and his success with Seattle.
Yeah he's fantastic,  love watching his returns.
