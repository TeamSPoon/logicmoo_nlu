Are you a Star Wars fan?
Sort of, I like the three that were released first.
Which one is your favorite?
That's easy, The Empire Strikes Back.
I agree, Luke finding out Darth Vader is his father is hard to beat.
Return of the Jedi runs a close second though.
Why do you say that?
I have always been a big fan of Jabba the Hut.
That's a rare one, you don't find too many Jabba fans out there.
True, I don't think I have ever met another Jabba fan myself.
