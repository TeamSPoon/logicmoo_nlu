What is the most memorable star wars movie for you?
I would say it is  the 1999 episode 1 because it was the first one I saw in theaters.
I see,that was an exciting time. I remember waiting in line for tickets. So much buzz.
There really was a ton of hype. What was your most memorable?
I have to go old school original Star Wars movie 1977. It was so meaningful to me  and watched it so many times,
It is the classic Star Wars. I liked how you had no idea of luke's father in the first one.
Ya it was so smart of george lucas to present them in the order he did.
Agreed, it would not have had the same impact if the plot in the  episode 1, 2 and 3 in the 200's had already been known.
Yes, the reveal of luke's father was such a shocker. Probably had a lot to do with the popularity of the originals.
Ya I still think they would have been groundbreaking but much less of a plot twist surprise ending if the movies had come out in order.
