is Taylor Swift the biggest pop artist around today?
Thats tough but I think she is
I loved Wildest Dreams
To me that was too slow.
So what was your favorite from her?
I dont have one because I am not a huge fan
Do you think Rihanna is bigger than her?
Yeah she crossed more genres.
She is an international artist as well
I highly doubt that.
