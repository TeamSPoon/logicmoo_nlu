Hey! Do you wanna build a snowman?
Absolutely not. I'm too busy trying to make a man out of you.
Then why don't you go on and kiss the girl?
Because hakuna matata?
What's that mean?
Hakuna matata? It means no worries... for the rest of our days.
Such a wonderful phrase.
All day and all night, 24/7, on land, in the air, or... under the sea.
I love how we can just randomly quote Disney movies and songs all day. You really get me.
Duh! That's why we're best friends, silly!
