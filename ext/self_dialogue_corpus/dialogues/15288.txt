Hi, do you ever listen to melodic metal?
I'm not sure I even know what that is, what does it sound like?
It's just like heavy metal vocals but with melodic instrumentation instead of the usual sounds
What are some examples of melodic metal bands?
Killswitch Engage and Insomnium are two of my favorites
Let me know a song I can listen to
Try When we Sleep by Insomnium
Ok I will listen to it
I love the way it's almost orchestrial but then you get the heavy metal screaming coming into it
It sounds good, I might look up some more bands in this genre
In Flames are another band you might like, I recently saw them live in England at a festival and was impressed
Are they British?
No they're from Sweden, there are a lot of great metal bands coming out of those Nordic countries
Are Insomnium Swedish too?
No, They're from Finland. Amon Amarth are another Swedish band of the same genre, you should look them up too
I have heard them before, they're very good, very like Sabaton
Yes, Sabaton are Swedish too.
I have heard their song Primo Victoria, it's the most memorable to me
Yes, a lot of their lyrics surround battles and wars, they are very inspiring to me
Thanks I'll look up some more melodic metal bands
