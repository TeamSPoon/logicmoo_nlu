Did you see the first Harry Potter movie?
I did, I thought it was good but probably the weakest one.
I can see that.  But you have to start simple in a series, after all they were just kids.
Yeah I know.  I still like it, just not as much as the later movies.
It was pretty cool how they hid Voldy in that guys turban.
Yeah that was pretty amazing, I would have never even expected that in a million years.
And that guy acted like such a putz the whole time.  Turns out he was much smarter than anyone let on.
I know, and a lot stronger.
It also shows how wizards are seduced by Voldy and his promises.
And that there are plenty of enemies waiting in the winds.
