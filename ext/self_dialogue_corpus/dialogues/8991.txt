One of my favorite bands in the seventies was Lynryd Skynryd.
Oh mine too! They were great!
Remember Ronnie Van Zant? He always wore that cowboy hat.
Yea they were a great southern rock band.
Sweet Home Alabama was one of my favorite songs.
And Freebird is a classic!!
It is awful that he was killed in the plane crash.
Several of the original band members are gone now.
I know, but their music will live on.
That is true. Lets go listen to the radio, maybe we will hear them.
