What do you think of the latest Superman movie?
I love it, I thought the story line where he almost died was great.
Oh my gosh I know, it was sad but was great when he came back with strength and saved the world.
I almost cried!
It was sad, but it had a great happy ending.
I love all of the super man movies.
Me to, they were well made and the story lines were great.
I hope they come out with more
I think there is a new one due out in 2018.
I sure hope so, the lead actor who plays superman does a great job!
