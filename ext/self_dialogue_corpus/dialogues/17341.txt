Hey. I've been looking for some new type of music to listen to, which genres do you like?
I mainly listen to pop, r&b, hip hop, stuff like that.
Oh. Those are the only types?
Ya I do not like rock or country that much.
OK. I listen to a little of those genres but not really. Which groups have you been listening to lately?
I have been listening to Alicia Keys, R. Kelly, Bruno Mars, and Janye West a lot.
I think I'll pass on thoat haha. I like more Rock and electronic music.
That's cool I like a little of those as well.
I thought you said you only like hip hop, r&b, etcetera.
Ya I did I just have been listening to that mainly in the recent months.
OK. What are some rock bands that you like?
I like some of the older stuff that I mainly listened to in my childhood.
Ya those are the years that I really listened to rock as well.
I like to listen to Linkin Park, Pink Floyd, ADCD, Metallica and stuff like that.
Oh wow those are all good bands.
Ya I listen to them now and again.
It's been a few years since I have listened to any of those.
