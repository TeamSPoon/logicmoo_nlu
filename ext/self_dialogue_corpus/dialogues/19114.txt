Hey, what kind of music do you listen to?
Um...well, right now I am listening a lot to a psytrance band.
What's psytrance
It is considered psychological trance.
Is there a particular artist you listen to?
Yeah, they are called Infected Mushroom.
They? How many are there?
There's only two, but they do enough that it sounds like a whole group.
Cool. How long they been around?
Oh, They've been around a good while. They have at least 10 studio albums, although their first couple are pretty basic.
Wow. That's a long time. I've never heard of them.
They are from Israel. But they moved to LA a few years ago.
Sweet. Have you seen them in concert? Do you play live?
They do, but I have never seen them. They are on my bucket list though.
Are they gonna be around here soon.
Not soon, but they are ridiculous. They play over 120 venues a year.
Holy crap, really? So in your words, what do they sound like?
They would be compared to techno, but they change tempos and riffs so often that the song never ends the same way it starts. They are amazing.
What bands do they sound like.
They sound nothing like any band I have heard and I have yet to find anyone who comes close. I just love them.
