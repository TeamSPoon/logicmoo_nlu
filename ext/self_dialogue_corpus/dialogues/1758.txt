Do you think the NFC South is the best division in Football?
Oh for sure! Its just stacked.
I agree but I am not sold on Atlanta
After the Super Bowl they sure looked vulnerable.
I think they were all year, but just got lucky at the right times.
Thats probably true. They had some big holes
I am actually more impressed with Tampa.
I think they have done some good moves.
And spent money....but not stupid money.
No, I agree. They signed people who will help and the drafted.
Its a good forumla and hopefully it works again
It would be nice
What are your thoughts about Saints?
I dont know what to make of them
I think there will be flashes here and there but they are a few years away still.
I think so too. They had a decent draft though.
The draft more and more is the key for teams.
I know...and then they don't have to overpay
Well unless you have a QB.
Well of course
