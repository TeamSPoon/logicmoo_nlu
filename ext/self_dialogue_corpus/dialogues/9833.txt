Hey Man did you see that new Tupac Movie yet?
No I sure didn't hopefully its as good as his music was
I know, shame that he had to die so young
Seems like most rappers that have talent pass away young
Yup Biggie Smalls and Tupac and Eazy E
Then again we still have some great rappers left like Jay Z and Dr DRE and Ice Cube
Ice Cube isn't he an actor
He started out as a rapper in a group called NWA with Dr DRE, you should check out the movie Straight outta compton
I saw the trailer for that one it looked promising
Yeah its an excellent movie
