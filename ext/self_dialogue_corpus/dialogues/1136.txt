Guess who is making a comeback.
Brett Favre?
No, even better. Todd Marinovich.
Really, with what team?
The SoCal Coyotes
Are they a NFL expansion team?
No, they are in the World Developmental Football League.
I've never header of it.
Not many people have.
When's the last time he played in the NFL?
1993 for the Raiders.
Any how old is he now?
A spry 48.
So, he'll never make it back to the NFL.
Unlikely, he might not even start for the Coyotes.
Do they have a good QA?
Yes, Jacob Russell was at the helm for their unbeaten season last year.
Is he 48 too?
No, he's only 25.
Half the age of Todd.
