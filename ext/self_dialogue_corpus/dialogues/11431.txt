I was listening to the radio this morning and they were playing a Beatles song.
What was it?
Yellow submarine.
We all live in a yellow submarine...that is a happy song.
Yeah, it took me back to my childhood.
I remember my father calling them hippies.
Mine too, he would not let us watch them when they were on "The Ed Sullivan Show".
Oh, he must have been strict.
Yes, he thought their music was going to ruin America.
All parents think their children's music is radical.
