Have you seen any good movies lately?
I have! I watched Get Out recently.
I don't know if I've heard of that. What's it about?
It's about an interracial couple meeting her parents for the first time.
Interesting. What genre is it in?
It's kind of a horror thriller.
Is it a gory slasher type horror?
No. It's more like a nervous edge thriller. Minimal blood.
That sounds really interesting. I'll have to watch that.
Have you seen anything good recently?
I watched Logan this week.
Is that the newest X men movie?
It is. The one with Wolverine/Logan's story.
He's my favorite of the X men.
I think he's most people's favorite.
Which is your favorite of the X men?
I like the more unusual ones, like Gambit.
Oh yeah, he was really cool.
Hopefully they will make more movies in the X men franchise!
I agree! I enjoy watching them.
