What do you think the purpose of music is?
To soothe us and let us express our emotions
That is a sound point
Yes it can help us to get rid of anger and things like that
I can see why they put it in movies
Yes. It gives us emotions of a certain kind
What music do you think is the most powerful?
Classical
I think you are right
It is the most complicated sound
It can make you feel very strong emotions too
Yes and it does not blow your eardrums out either
True
I love Mozzart the most
He has some great pieces
I agree with you
Do you like modern day music?
Not so much
I wonder if there is any good music now like Mozzart.
That is highly doubtful
