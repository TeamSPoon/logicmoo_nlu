Getting ready for the upcoming NFL season?
Yeah, I am, got some new jerseys too.
Cool, whose jerseys did you buy?
Odell Beckham Jr and Eli Manning.
Go Giants! We're going to do very good this year.
I believe so too, I cannot wait to get to MetLife Stadium to see some games.
You are going to some games?
Yes, my daughter is finally old enough to take.
Great, sounds like some great bonding time, also another Giants fan in the family.
Hoping for it, you're son really took to the team too.
Yeah, he always watches them on television, hopefully I can take him to a game.
We should go together.
Sounds good, one thing is certain we will be a lot better than the Jets.
I don't think that was a hard conclusion to come to.
Nope, hopefully we can win it all again.
Yes, after all we always come out of nowhere to win.
Just like when we beat the Patriots, nobody really gave us a chance.
How I wish we could do that again in the Super Bowl.
Yes I would love to dethrone the Patriots.
We just need to get to the big game.
