What was your favorite Batman movie?
For me, the original one with Tim Burton was always the best.
Out of the original ones, I would agree with you.  If we're talking all of them, The Dark Knight.
Hard to argue that.  That movie pretty much had it all.
But you'd still prefer the first one?
Yeah.  Just had some charm to it as it was a superhero movie before they stared making them all the time.
I get it.  It's hard to believe it came out almost 30 years ago.
Are you serious?  Am I really that old?
Want me to really answer that question?
No, please don't.  Can't believe it was that long ago.
