What kind of music do you like?  I like rock.
I like rock too.  I love the classic rock the best though.
Like Guns N Roses and Poison?
Yeah.  Their music was so intense and they always put on a good show.
The old school bands were great but I like a lot of new stuff too?
Like What?
I love Kid Rock!  I'm always singing along to his songs.
I love his "All Summer Long"  It reminds me of my teenage years growing up on the lake.
I really like Bush too.
They're pretty good.  I love "Glycerine"
