Do you know how the main cast of Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, and Carrie Fisher picked to be in Star Wars?
I figured there was a big cattle call. I remember that George Lucas wanted to cast unknowns for the main three roles.
There were several actors under consideration. They were put in sets of three because they complemented each other well.
So Mark, Harrison, and Carrie were a group even before they were given the gig?
That's right. It was a matter of, pick all of them or none.
It must have been such pressure for all of them.
It was down to two trios at the end, and then Lucas picked the three we all know and love.
Who were some of the actors under consideration?
Kurt Russell was being considered for Han Solo. He had that laid back sarcasm thing that Lucas was looking for.
He would have made a good Han. But Harrison, he owns the role forever now.
