I just saw the new pirates movie.
What did you think.
I really liked it a lot.
I heard it was good.
It was pretty good. I would say more memorable than the other sequels.
What did you like about it?
I liked that they gave a back story for Captain Jack Sparrow.
I think that is awesome because it humanizes him more.
He seemed to be silly in this movie though.
Like more drinking?
Yes he drank more and made more eluded advances of being interested in women.
How was the back story?
It really went in to how he got his name.
I think that is a great way to also make people want to see it more.
I was a good surprise.
I also liked that they brought back Will Turner and Elizabeth Swan.
That was truly a surprise for me.
It was good to go into it not knowing anything about it.
Yes it just made it more enjoyable without expectations.
That is good that you were able to make your own mind up about it.
