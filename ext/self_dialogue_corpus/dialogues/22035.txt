My husband is a movie buff for sure.
What type of movie's does he like?
He likes sci-fi and horror movies.  Also lots of action too.
Hey, I like that type of genre too.
I hate sci-fi and horror movies.  He likes them a lot and I just can't get into them.
Wonder why you don't like them?  So many people love to watch those types of movies.
I find it hard to put myself into anything that doesn't seem real or that you have to imagine.
What do you mean by that?
Well, for example sci-fi isn't reality to me.  It's stuff that could happen, but probably wont'.
But, that's why I like it so much.  You sort of get taken away by the fantasty of it all.
Yeah, I guess but I just can't sit still watching that type of movie.  I just have to get up and do something else.
Well, what kind of movie's do you like?
Well, I like some love story types.  And also some mystery types that keep you on the edge of your seat.
Like what?  Name some and see if I am familar with them.
I really liked Bridges of Madison County for a love story.  I found myself really engrossed in the movie.
Oh, I've never seen that.  Did that have Clint Eastwood in it?
Yes, it did.
Well, what other movies do you like?
I really liked Cape Fear, I think there are two versions.  This one had Robert Diniro
Oh, yeah I saw that and it was scary, but I really enjoyed watching it.
