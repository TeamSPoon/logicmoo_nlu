Hey, have you ever heard of the movioe Loose Cannons?
No, I have not not.
Well, it stars both Dan Aykroyd and Gene Hackman as cops.
Those two in the same film? What's the plot?
Gene is a old cop whose lost all patience with the world, while Dan is a genius former FBI type who lost his mind after being captured and tortured by a drug cartel.
And this is supposed to be a comedy?
Yeah, because when ever Dan gets scared or stressed, he becomes a revolving door of multiple personailities.
Mulitiple Personalities? Like who?
Like the Cowardly Lion and Doorthy, to Butch Cassidy and even the Road Runner.
Okay, that sounds kind of funny.
