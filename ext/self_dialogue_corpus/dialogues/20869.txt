I just saw the new Pirates of the Caribbean movie!
Oh what did you think of it?
I think the franchise has kind of played out to be honest. It wasn't super exciting.
Yeah, I feel like the Pirates movies have been coming out since I was in junior high school.
They have! This is the fifth installment.
Time to put it to rest.
I agree. Have you seen any good movies lately?
Not really. I am really excited for Dark Tower to come out though!
Oh, what is that? I haven't heard of it.
It's based on Stephen King's Dark Tower series. It comes out in August.
Oh I used to really love Stephen King books. They really creep me out!
Me too! The Dark Tower series is his best work, in my opinion.
I'll have to check it out. I'm trying to decide if I should see the new Baywatch.
Oh, is that the movie with Dwayne Johnson?
Yes! Its based on the old tv show.
Interesting, I actually don't think I've seen any of his other movies. He is so famous though.
Yeah, he is. I saw the Fast and Furious movie that he is in.
Oh I think I've seen that one too. The original Fast and Furious is my favorite.
I think it might be my favorite too. The original is always best!
The second and third ones are pretty good too.
