I want to watch more sports this year. I think it will bring me closer to my boyfriend.
What type of sports do you like?
I like to watch gymnastics and table-tennis.
Are these the sports he likes?
Unfortunately no. He really only watches football but I have never liked football.
You should give it a try, you may be surprised. I didn't like it much either when I was young.
What changed your mind?
I think I just didn't like it because I didn't know the rules! It just seemed that they were starting and stopping constantly and it made me feel impatient and annoyed.
That's exactly how I feel! I don't know the rules at all!
I can teach you the rules. It's not hard at all.
Thank you so much. I can't wait!
No problem. In fact if you'd like we can go to a Steelers came when the season starts. My cousin is usually able to get me tickets.
Oh, NFL football doesn't happen all year round?
No, there are seasons. The season starts in September and end with Superbowl.
Superbowl is usually in February right?
Yes! How did you know that ?
My boyfriend made me watch it with him and his friends the past couple of years.
I'm sure you had no idea going on, but at least you may have enjoyed the halftime shows
I did! Do all NFL games have great performers like that?
Not big celebrities like the Superbowl would, no. Usually just a local singer, a marching band, and cheerleaders dancing.
