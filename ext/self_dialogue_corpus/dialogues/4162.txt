I just saw a very scary movie!
What was it?
"It Comes At Night."
Oh, yeah! I wanted to see that? The one will Joel Edgerton, right?
Yes, that's the one.
He's a great actor. Is it scary? Is he good in it?
Oh, it's definitely scary. Do NOT go alone. And yeah, Joel is excellent as usual.
Nice. He's the man.
I would say I'd see it again with you, but I'm too scared to do so.
That's alright! I'll have to find someone else to take! I'll let you know what I think.
