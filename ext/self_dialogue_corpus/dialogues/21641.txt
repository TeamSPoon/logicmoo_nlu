I've been on a big noir kick lately.
I've never really watched a noir film. Do you have any recommendations?
Well, The Maltese Falcon is a classic. It's based on a Dashell Hammet novel.
I've heard of that one!
Humphrey Bogart plays the lead, it's really a classic.
So that's a good place to start?
It's definitely not a bad one. I also like The Petrified Forest.
That one's new to me.
I can't say much about it without giving it away, but the ending is very moving.
What is it you like so much about noir films?
It's really easy to feel like you've been transported to another time and place. Even the language is different.
So you know a lot of 40s slang then.
Not really! But it just feels different in a way that films today can't be.
So you don't want them to be remade?
It'd probably be a mistake. What they should really do is adapt more Patricia Highsmith novels.
Do I know anything?
She wrote the original Strangers On a Train.
Wow, that's a great movie!
Isn't it? Very clever premise.
It is. I hope they make more like it.
