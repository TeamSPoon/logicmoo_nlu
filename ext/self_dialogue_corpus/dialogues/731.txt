Who is going to win the AFC west this season?
Kansas City for sure.
What about the NFC South?
The Saints will easily win that division.
You don't think Brees is getting to old?
No, and Matt Ryan is good but he doesn't have a super bowl winning team around him
What about Cam Newton in Carolina?
He's ok, but he doesn't have the receiving corps to catch the ball.
Who has the best defense?
Probably Atlanta.
Who do you have winning the NFC East?
The Giants, Eli has got everything in place to win
But they have no defense.
They don't need defense, their offense is that good.
No, man, defense wins championships.
You can't score points on defense, you need points to win..
Yes you can, its called a pick-6 or a fumble recovered in the endzone.
Oh, yeah, i forgot about that... and safeties too
Exactly.. to build a great team you have to start with a good defense.
I can't wait for the pre-season to start.
