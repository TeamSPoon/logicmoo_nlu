Have you seen any new movies lately?
Yeah, I saw the the new King Kong movie.
Was it any good?
It was great. Really action-packed.
Really? I want to watch it soon.
You definitely should watch it.
Was it as good as the new Pirates of the Carribean movie?
Just as good but different, of course.
What movie the main male character play in from King Kong?
I think he played in the X-men movie, First Class as the young Magneto.
Oh yeah. That's why he looked so familiar in the trailer.
First Class was a good movie too. I liked learning about how the X-men came about.
We got to see how Mystic looked as a person instead of as the blue mutant.
It was interesting to see Xavier walking around instead of moving about in his wheelchair.
Too bad he could keep walking and keep his awesome powers.
That was a shame. At least his powers are cool.
Magneto has one of the best powers though.
His power would be a good power to have if you need to defend yourself.
If he ever couldn't walk, he could just sit on a piece of metal and fly himself around.
It would be cool to have the power to fly.
