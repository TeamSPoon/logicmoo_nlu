Who is the best Beatle?
I'm going to say Paul McCartney-- he contributed so much to the Beatles, and had a long career and good hits after.
John Lennon is my favorite-- I love his songs, except Revolution 9.  That's not even really a song.
Yeah, that song is awful.  It's probably the worst song ever, if you can even call it a song.
All of the Beatles were really talented, even Ringo.
Yeah, Octopus' Garden and Don't Pass Me By are both really good songs.
What about George Harrison?
Frank Sinatra called Something the greatest love song ever written.  Who am I to argue with ol' Blue Eyes?
No one-- that's who! What's your favorite Beatles album?
They're all really good, but I'm going to go with Abbey Road.  I love how the songs flow together.
