What do you think they'll do in The Last Jedi?
I think Kylo and Rey will have to team up to stop Luke.
Are you kidding, then who is the bad guy?
Luke turns bad and they try to turn him good, Snope is also a bad guy.
That makes no sense, Luke would never turn bad.
Well bad is relative, I'm sure he thinks he's doing good by ridding the world of Jedi.
Regardless, he's training Rey and Kylo and Ren wouldn't be powerful enough to stop Luke.
That might be a flaw in my idea, but flaws haven't stopped them before.
I think Kylo goes full dark-side and it's an epic battle between him and Rey, who ditches her teacher like and goes to fight too early.
Maybe, they copied Star Wars, might as well copy Empire Strikes Back.
