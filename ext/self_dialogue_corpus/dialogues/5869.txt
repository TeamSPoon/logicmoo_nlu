Did you know that the disney movie Cinderella was released in 1950?
I knew it was a while ago but not that long.
It is classic! Every little girl still watches it today.
You are  right. Who was your favorite character.
I liked Gus the little fat mouse.
Yea the mice were funny.
I loved the cute little birds that helped the mice sew the dress.
Me too.
Cinderella was beautful even if she was a cartoon.
Yes she was.
