I hate current rock music.
What do you mean?
Rock music use to be about something now it's just lame.
What do you think it was about?
The 80s rocks music was about going out and having a good time.
What about 70s rock music?
It was about coming back from the war or being oppressed.
What about the 90s?
It was about being sad because it was raining outside or something.
You only listened to Nirvana in the 90s.
