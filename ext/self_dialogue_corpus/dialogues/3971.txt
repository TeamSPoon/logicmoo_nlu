Did you see that M. Night movie where the kids go to see their grandparents?
No. I haven't watched a movie of his in awhile.
I know me either but I checked this one out randomly one day.
Is it any good? Lady in the water was a real bummer.
It's actually pretty good!
Old people creep me out so I might like it.
What about the new new one?
Split? I heard it has a twist ending.
I mean all of his movies do.
Yeah but this one is supposed to be really good
