I've been thinking about Elvis Presley recently.  do you think he was over-rated, or do you think he deserved all the attention he got?
Well, when you consider that he was a singer who was certainly unique, and that he also appeared in movies, i would say he deserved everything he got.  he was one of a kind; a once in a lifetime superstar.
I know what you mean.  it's hard to believe it's been 40 years since he died.  I"ll never forget that day.
I'm a little too young to remember his death, but i do know it made millions of people very sad.  He had fans all over the world.
The thing about Elvis is that when it looked like his career might have been over, in the late 1960s, he made a great come back.
That's for sure.  One of my brothers still has the Elvis album that he recorded live in Hawaii; i think that was a big part of the come-back.
And his mega-hit  "In the Ghetto" made a lot of the younger folks, who hadn't been big Elvis fans, take notice.
Wow i had totally forgot that song.  When i think of his comeback, i think more of the super song "Suspicious Minds."
Oh, what a great song, i still find myself humming that song once in a while.  Always nice to talk about Elvis; a true legend.
Legend is a word used too loosely, but in Presley's case it's true...he was and still is a legend.  his music lives on.
