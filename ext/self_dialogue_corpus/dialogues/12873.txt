I remember seeing Star Wars when it first came out.
I was only 3.
The lines were huge.
I heard it was a big success.
It was groundbreaking.
Now the special effects seem cheesy.
The musical score was a big part of the success.
Scored by Williams?
Of course C3PO and R2D2 stole the show!
I do love Droids!
