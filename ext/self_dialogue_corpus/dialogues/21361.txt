Have you seen the new Beauty and the Beast film?
I haven't seen it yet. Have you?
Yes. I thought it was great!
Really? I'm not sure how I feel about the trend of live action remakes for old cartoon movies.
What other live action remake films are you thinking of besides Beauty and the Beast?
I mean like the Alice in Wonderland ones with Johnny Depp, or Maleficent, which wasn't quite a remake but still similar.
Oh yeah, I thought the Alice in Wonderland films were a bit of a letdown, but I haven't seen Maleficent.
I didn't think Maleficent was that good. The live-action Cinderella got good reviews though, I've heard.
Oh really? I haven't seen that, maybe I'll have to check that out sometime.
Yeah I'd like to see it too. So you would recommend Beauty and the Beast then?
I would definitely recommend it.
Okay! Well maybe I'll go and give it a chance.
Speaking of live action remakes, have you heard about the new Lion King film?
No! They're remaking the Lion King?
Yep! James Earl Jones will be back as Mufasa for it.
Wow, no kidding! Who else is in it?
Donald Glover is supposedly going to be playing Simba, and Seth Rogen and Billy Eichner have been cast as Timon and Pumba.
That actually sounds like a great cast
Yeah, I'll be very excited to see how it turns out
Me too. The original Lion King is still one of my favorite films
