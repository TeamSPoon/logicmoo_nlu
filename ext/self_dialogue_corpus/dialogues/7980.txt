Do you think Taylor Swift is any good?
You know,I think maybe as a country artist more than pop.
Really? That's interesting.
Yea,she became interested in country when she was around nine I think.
I think somewhere in that area.
Then she went pop and became a huge hit.
Her album Fearless debuted at number one in 2008
Yes,huge for her.
Best selling album of 2009 in the USA.
Wow,I,didn't realize that.
