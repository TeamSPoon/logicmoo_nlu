I'm in the mood to hear some music.
What were you thinking, pop, country, or rock.
I was actually think some techno.
Techno, that's an odd choice for you.
I know, but I just feel like loosing myself in the noise.
Well if that's what you want then ok.
I just don't know who I want to listen to.
I usually just ask my Echo to play some off the web.
Where there's a good idea.
So what do you wanna do while we listen?
What else is there to do but dance?
Well that sounds like fun.
Did you ever hear Ghosts'N'Stuff by Deadmau5?
Not that I remember.
Perfect then we can start there.
Well now that's settled.
Ill go get the Echo and bring it in here so we have room.
Good idea, it'd be kind of cramped in the bedroom.
Hey why don't we call our friends over and just make a night of it.
Even better, the more the merrier.
