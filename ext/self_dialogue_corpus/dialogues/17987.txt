Say what do you think of John Legend?
He's an all around talented guy.
Right? He sings, writes music, acts AND produces I think.
Yeah he played a jazz musician in La La Land.
Did you know he got 10 Grammy Awards?
Not bad at all! Like I said, he's talented.
And he won the Academy Award for Best Original Song for the song "Glory" from the film Selma.
I liked that song. It was emotional.
I think it captured the theme of the film.
Yep I think he really put his heart into it.
Isn't that what creating music is about?
You know, I don't really know.
One composer described his process and it was fascinating.
How did he describe it?
It was connected with writing a film's musical score.
What was his process?
He watches the entire film. Then he internalizes the emotional content.
Sounds interesting. What else?
Then he gives back the emotional content by translating it into music. Something like this.
You're right, that's interesting!!
