Remember that fat worm thing in the STAR WARS movie?
I think it was Jaba the Hut.
He looked like he smelled bad.
And he had Princess Leia as a pet.
Yeah, he had her on a chain.
And C3-P0 stood behind Jaba.
I think C3-PO did translations for Jaba.
And R2-D2 served drinks on a tray.
It was like Jaba was king.
And they were having a party all the time.
