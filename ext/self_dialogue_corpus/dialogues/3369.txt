What are your thoughts on the shinning?
I watched this on tv when I WAS VERY YOUNG AND IT HAS SCARED ME SILLY EVER SINCE.
How young, not that it isn't scary at any age...
Maybe 8-9, too young. It really impacted me.
That is very young. There is so much to this movie, you probably did not fully grasp it at that time.
Very true. so much went right over my head. The more times I see it the more I notice like references to native tribes.
Yes there is a lot more than first meets the eye. They even have a documentary on the making of the shinning.
I heard stephen king really did not like the film version and felt it was not his original vision.
Ya King was not a fan of the film at all. I however am a huge fan and especially of shelley Duvall's performance.
She was great in this film. I also thought Jack nicholson's performance was oscar worthy.
