Which Disney movie is your favorite?
My all-time favorite is definitely Beauty and the Beast!
I love that one too! The music is so wonderful!
I love the story, what is your favorite song from it?
Oh, that's hard to choose. I think it would be Angela Lansbury singing the main song.
ME TOO, I love that!!!
Do you like the new version that came out?
No, I absolutely hate it!!
Me too, I was so disappointed.
Yeah, I had high hopes for it but it was a big let down.
