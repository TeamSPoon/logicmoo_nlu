Louis Tomlinson is releasing a new single apparently.
I saw that. Are you excited about it?
Sort of. But I also wish One Direction would just get back together so it's bittersweet.
I wish they would too! Boy band music is my guilty pleasure!
I love boy bands!
Now that One Direction is gone, though, it seems like there's no band left to fill that void.
I wish we were still back in the boy band glory days of *NSYNC, the Backstreet Boys, and 98 Degrees.
Me too. Who was your favorite out of those three?
I know most people choose *NSYNC, but I definitely loved the Backstreet Boys most.
I have to go with *NSYNC if only for Justin Timberlake.
That's fair enough. Do you think One Direction will ever get back together?
I could imagine them maybe doing some sort of reunion tour someday.
I guess if the Spice Girls were able to accomplish that, then anything is possible!
I forgot about the Spice Girls! They were iconic.
Totally. I know girly pop music doesn't get a lot of respect, but personally I think some of the most iconic music of the new millennium has resulted from it.
You know, someone actually once said to me that The Beatles were technically the first official boy band. So really, there should be more respect!
That's so funny, I never thought of it like that but I guess that's true.
Yeah, teenage girls went just as crazy over The Beatles as they have over *NSYNC and One Direction.
I think the Beatles were still uniquely talented but there's no question that modern boy bands know how to make some catchy tunes.
I agree completely
