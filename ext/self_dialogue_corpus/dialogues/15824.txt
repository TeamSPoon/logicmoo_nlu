It is so good to enjoy music you haven't heard in so long.
What brought that on? Are you listening to something right now?
Yep I just put on Seals and Crofts Greatest Hits. It was one of my favorite albums as a teenager.
They were so different and yet some how familiar at the same time.
Maybe it had something to do with their belief in the Baha'i faith. Peaceful guys.
I am not familiar with that religion.
Wow I am listening to them right now and HummingBird is playing and out of the corner of my eye I see movement and it's a humming bird at one of my flowers!
How fun! You are so lucky like that.
Oh and another Greatest Hits album that I used to listen to was Jim Croce.
Mr Bad Bad Leroy Brown himself!
Time in a Bottle was probably my favorite song on that album
Hmmm...I would have to go with Photographs and Memories for my pick.
You know most people are going to say that what ever decade they were a teenager in is the one with the best music. I have to disagree.
Yeah but it's understandable why they would. So many things are influencing your emotions at that time.
That's true. I like music from the Big Band era as well as Motown from the 60' and 70's.
So you are an exception to that observation.
My husband is much younger than me and he has always loved '70's music and he wasn't born until 1980.
That's pretty cool.
Back to work for me break time is over. "Workin' 9 to 5" (yes i am singing the song!)
You never stop with the punny stuff! Bye
