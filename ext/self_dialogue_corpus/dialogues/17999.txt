What do you think of radio music?
Where do I begin?
So you're not a fan?
I feel like there's so much bad with it.
Talk to me here.
It's extrememly watered down.
How so?
All the musical elements are the same.
This is true.
There's nothing special about any radio songs.
Nothing at all?
Nothing. You've heard one, you've heard them all.
Man, you're being harsh.
I'm just being real here!
I feel you. Any positives at least?
Eh, not that I can think of.
Alright. I just thought I'd ask. I was curious.
No problem. I like having these talks.
Yeah, they're fun.
We'll have to do this again.
