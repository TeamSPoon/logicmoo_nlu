What song would you say is the weirdest song on the radio right now.
Weirdest song? What do you mean by that?
Like, you turn on the radio and its a weird song.
I guess I'd have to say Malibu is a weird song.
Is that the new song by Miley Cyrus?
Yeah, that one. Something about it is just really weird to me.
I can see that, I cant get into it at all.
Yeah, its a really strange one. I like her voice, but the song is strange.
I like her voice too, I dont know if i could call the song strange or weird though.
Well, whats the weirdest song for you then.
Swish, Swish. Good voice, but if its about Taylor Swift, I just cant see it.
Thats the new Katy Perry and Nikki Minaj song right?
Yeah, I read it was a hit back after Taylor's, Bad Blood song.
Really? I listened to it for a few seconds but I couldn't stand it.
Neither could I! It's such a bad song.
It really is, like, how?
I know! If that was her response to Bad Blood, she just needs to stop.
Exactly. That song was amazingly bad.
Yeah it was, Bad Blood was so much better.
Yup!
