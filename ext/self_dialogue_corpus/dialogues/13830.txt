I totally love how much Lady Gaga feels her music when she sings.
I have to totally agree and what a free spirit she is.
Yes, I love that she doesn't care what anybody else thinks about her.
She is so into being different and yet she relates to so many people with her music.
When she did the David Bowie tribute I could really feel her heart.
Everyone felt it.  She is ironic in the way she connects with her fans.
What is your favorite Lady Gaga song?
I would have to say my favorite song is Poker Face. You?
My favorite is Born This Way because it touches a subject on equality and that means something.
That is a great song.  I hope to see her in concert sometime.
