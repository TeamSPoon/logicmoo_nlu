What's your favorite rock band?
My favorite modern rock band has to be Coldplay but as for the classics it would have to be the beatles.
I love those bands, especially cloldplay's Viva La Vida and the Beatles Yesterday.
Some of my favorite songs as well, and I am certainly enjoying a lot of coldplay's current stuff.
There recent song "fly on" really grabbed me.
Oh, I love that whole album (the "O" album).
I think they have become much more experimental with rock and pop.
I agree, the entire ghost stories album is different from their more classic music (in a good way).
My favorite track from that album was definitely magic.
Did you know that it was nominated for a Grammy for best pop album and won billboards award for best rock album/ Definitely illustrates the point.
