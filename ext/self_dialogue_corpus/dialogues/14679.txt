Did you see what the Boston Celtics wore before the game?
Yeah, wearing all black like going to a funeral
That was pretty messed up, even more since isaiah thomas' sister just passed away
Yeah I thought that was weird too.
I love how John wall buried the other team with that 3 pointer
Oh yeah me too, he definitely showed them up for wearing all black
I also loved how he responded about his city
yeah you don't go out and do that in another mans city
I am looking forward to game 7 though, who do you think will win?
Well with the way things are going i'd say celtics but I want the wizards to win
I agree, I prefer the wizards to the celtics, I think celtics have won enough already lol.
Yep, most championships ever is enough for a while I think
So who you got in the spurs vs warriors?
It's really hard to chose against the warriors, but I think that the spurs have a good chance.
Yeah I agree, especially with the size advantage the spurs have.
Yeah they defenitely have that, and also a better defensive team
True that, I just hope whoever gets through is tired when facing the cavs
So you dont think either wizards or celtics have a chance against the cavs?
No I don't see it going past 5 games
Bold prediction but the way the cavs are playing it's totally possible.
