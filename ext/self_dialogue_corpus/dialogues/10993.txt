When do the Penguins and the Senators play again?
They play tonight in Ottawa.
Which team won game two of their series?
Pittsburgh, so the series is even at one game apiece.
Ottawa's goalie, Craig Anderson, has been impressive in the playoffs so far.
Indeed, and so has his teammate, Erik Karlsson.
It's crazy that Pittsburgh still beat Washington, who had the best record in the regular season.
Yes, but they were the better playoff team, which is more important this time of year.
This is true. Pittsburgh is the defending Stanley Cup champion.
Who did Pittsburgh beat last year in the finals?
They beat the San Jose Sharks.
If I recall correctly, it was the Sharks' first time in the Stanley Cup finals.
Has a Canadian NHL team ever won the Stanley Cup?
Oh yes. The Montreal Canadiens and Toronto Maple Leafs each have won numerous times.
What about recently?
Montreal was the last Canadian team to win it, and they last won it in 1993.
It would be interesting then to see Ottawa win it all for Canada.
I agree, since ice hockey is the most popular sport there.
I believe Ottawa will win it all because they play the hardest every game.
They possibly could, but, of course, they have to contain Sidney Crosby.
