My girlfriend really likes rap and pop music
Is that hard for you since you don't
it's not that I don't I just have to be in the mood for it
Have you discovered anything you like because of her

Anything else?
I think I realized I like Beyonce more than I thought I did.
Yes, Lemonade is revolutionary.
