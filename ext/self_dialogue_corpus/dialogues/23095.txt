Have you seen the new Wonder Woman movie yeti?
No, I wanted to go this past weekend to see it but got busy and had no time.
I haven't seen it yet either an I will probably wait for the Blu Ray DVD to be released.
I probably wait too.  What is your favorite super hero movie?
I have always liked the Superman movies.  You?
I just saw Civil War and it was absolutely Amazing.
So is that your favorite one?
I would have to say yes but before I saw Civil War, I really liked The Batman movies.
I really have never been a big fan of Batman and I don't know why.
So you probably didn't care for Batman vs Superman?
You are correct because Batman beat Superman.
I think that is why I liked it a lot.
I imagine that is why the movie did not have rave reviews.
Are you saying there are more Superman fans then Batman fans?
No, I think a lot of people like both characters and didn't enjoy seeing them go against each other.
I never thought of it that way but you are totally right.
I have to admit though that I do like the bat mobile.
Yes, the  bat mobile is one cool mode of transportation.
I love that Superman can fly and that he wears a cape.
Definitely is a cool attribute that Superman has.
