If you could learn more about any side character in Star Wars who would it be?
Boba Fett for sure.  He was competent enough to fight Jedi and have Han on the run.
Yes, and that alone is worthy of a story.  He has never had enough screen time.
Plus I heard he escaped from that monster on Tatooine.
Yeah I heard that too, it would be exciting to see how he has done what he's done and what goes on after Tatooine.
We saw him as a kid, I would like to see how he trained and became such a great character.
I've always wondered that too, who trained him?  Is he force sensitive and doesn't know it?
I have a feeling that while not all the characters have force powers as strong as a Jedi, they are force adjacent you could say.
I agree, Obi-Wan says there is no such thing as luck, and these guys are way too skilled to not be using some type of force powers.
Yes, maybe not force sensitive like a Jedi or Sith, but they get a little nudge from it.
