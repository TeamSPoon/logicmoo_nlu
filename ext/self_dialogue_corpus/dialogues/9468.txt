What's your rap guilty pleasures?
I have so many, I identify primarily as a conscious rap fan, which is nothing to be guilty about. However, I really like Soulja Boy and Chief Keef.
Ha! Those young dudes, I guess Soulja Boy isn't that young anymore, make fun music.
Yes, it's fun. The lyrics aren't deep, but the confidence, the cadence, the beat are all there.
It's also really nice to see these kids who grew up in poverty make some cash.
Right, I can't hate on it. They're doing good for themselves and their family.
Except Bobby Shmurda.
Right, Shmurda didn't take peoples advice about getting away from crime seriously and now he's in jail.
I'd hate to see the same thing happen to Kodak Black.
It could happen, but I really hope it doesn't. He's a prodigious talent.
