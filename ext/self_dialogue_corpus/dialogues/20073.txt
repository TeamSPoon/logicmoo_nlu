So did you see Logan yet?
Not yet but the trailer looked awesome!
It was!  It was easily the best Wolverine movie so far...
Really?  Why do you say that?
Well it had a dark tone like the Batman Begins movies did...It's gritty and emotional...
Dang - that does sound good.  Why was it emotional?
Well, I don't want to give anything away but it's said to the last Wolverine movie...
Alright, don't spoil it!
I won't.  I will say that the action sequences were incredible as well!
Wow, you're really making me want to see it!
You should!  I'm not sure if it's still playing at the movies though.
Yea, I might have missed my chance on that one.
Maybe it's still playing at IMAX?  I would check online.
OK, I'll check it out when we get off the phone.  Would you go with me if it's still playing?
Definitely!  I would have no problem seeing it again.
OK, cool!  Maybe I'll watch some interviews with the cast online.
That's a good idea.  There's an insightful interview with Hugh Jackman about it but I forget where it was at...
No problem - I'll just do some surfing!
Alright, glad you're excited about it!  Just let me know if you want to go!
I will!  Thanks man!
