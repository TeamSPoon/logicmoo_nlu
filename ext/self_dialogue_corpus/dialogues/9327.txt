Who do you think was better, Biggie or Tupac?
I think they both were about equal.
I think Biggie told more stories in his music. Pac kept it real.
What do you mean kept it real?
Pac had rap that made you stop and think and want to take action. Biggie told you a good story to listen to while smoking a blunt.
You are so silly. But you do have a point.
I got music from both of them in my phone and on my computer.
Me too. I think I got every album downloaded that Pac ever made.
His best album was All Eyez on Me.
I know right. I can't wait to see the movie with the same title, it looks like it will be good.
