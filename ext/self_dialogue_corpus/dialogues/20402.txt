Have you seen the new Cars movie yet?
Cars 3? I hope it's better than Cars 2.
Much better, Cars 2 was ridiculous.
Does it have the original cast?
Yes even Paul Newman  is back as Doc Hudson.
That's amazing how?
Flashbacks but there are a lot of new characters too.
So dies Lightning still win the day in the end?
Not quite he becomes a mentor like Doc.
That's cool. Did you see it in 3D?
No but I hear it's great in 3D are you planning to watch it that wY?
Yes as a special treat for my kid.
There was a cute shirt movie that sired before.
Was it the new Frozen shirt?
No, that comes out in November I think it was about a bully learning a lesson.
Aw that's cute. Was it a long movie?
No but between the previews and the short film, it was an extra 30 minutes.
So I can come in late after the movie starts?
Yes especially if your kid has a short attention span.
Good to know thank you.
