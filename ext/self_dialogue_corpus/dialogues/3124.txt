Who do you think is the best quarterback in the NFL?
I would have to say that it is probably Tom Brady if I had to pick one.
Who was the other quarterback you would pick if you could pick two.
It would definitely be Aaron Rodgers.
What do you think about the Patriots?
I think they are actually pretty amazing. It's a very well run franchise.
What do you think about the accusations that they cheat all the time.
I think that most teams probably do.
What do you think is so amazing about them?
It really seems like they can turn about any NFL player into a star.
That does seem true. Randy Moss really did resurect his career when he went there.
Do you think they will win the Super Bowl again?
If I had to bet on one team to do it, it would be them. They are just so good on both sides of the ball.
Who do you think has the best chance of knocking them off?
It really is hard to pick any one team. To me they are the only team that really stands out.
I would probably say that Atlanta might be able to beat them if given another chance.
It's possible. Matt Ryan seems to still be underrated despite the fact he won the MVP.
I think he sure seems to have more weapons than what he used to to work with.
Julio Jones is probably the best receiver in the NFL right now.
I would say it's between him, Antonio Brown, and O'dell Becham Jr.
