I cannot stand some characters in movies and fiction
I mean is that not the same as anyone
No i mean i loathe some of them
What ones
I cannot stand Jar Jar binks he is horrible
Well yeah everyone hates him
I mean i feel like the series would be better if he did not exist
Might be but the plot was written with him in mind
That is exactly the problem
I can see that i guess
