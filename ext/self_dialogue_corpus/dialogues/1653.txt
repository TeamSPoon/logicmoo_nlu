The football season is coming!  I am so pumped!
I can see that.
This is the time when I get to see my friends and relatives.
You are lucky that many of your friends and relatives like to watch football games.
Even friends and relatives who are not crazy about football games get together on most game days.
My brother is the only relative of mine who likes football.
Perhaps you can bring him to our house next time we throw a football party.
He will like that.
The more the merrier.
You have a nice big backyard.  It is suitable for parties.
I enjoy having football parties.
When I was at your party the last time, your guests seemed to have a great time.
I hope you had a good time too even though you hardly knew anybody else.
I had a great time.  Your friends were very nice and welcoming.
Next time, please bring your brother.
Thank you for the invitation.
I will be going to the first home game at Gillette Stadium with my dad.  I will throw a party at my house for the following game.  We can watch the game on TV.
It sounds like fun.
It will be fun and you are invited.
Thanks again for inviting me and my brother.
