Outside of The Godfather Parts 1, 2, and 3, what's the best mob movie of all time?
That's easy. Goodfellas. Best mob movie of all time.
Outside of the Godfather movies, right?
Naturally.  No mob movie does what Goodfellas does. It shows why it's enticing to be in the mob.
Yeah, it kind of busted the myth of the mob living wealthy.
"I ordered some spaghetti with marinara sauce and I got egg noodles and ketchup. I'm an average nobody."
Haha, I love that quote. "For us to live any other way was nuts." But, man, there was no movie like it a the time. It set the new standard for mob pictures. For crime pictures.
Yeah, it was so fast paced. It moved at breakneck speed.
But what really made the movie, what really made it so memorable, was the narration.
Oh my god, Ray Liotta. Wall to wall narration.
It all goes back to the writing and directing.  Nicholas Pileggi and Martin Scorsese. Brilliant.
They worked on 12 drafts together, starting with Pileggi's book.
One thing the speed of the movie did . . . it moved so quickly that we and even Henry Hill didn't realize how deep he was in things until it was too late.
How about how Joe Pesci turns from funny mob lightweight to total psychopath?
That was brilliant, too. Easy to argue that Pesci stole the movie his performance was so brilliant.
We've not even mentioned DeNiro.
My good! He was great. And a connection to The Godfather.
But again the breakneck speed. At the end, when Henry Hill was on speed, it's like the movie was out of control.
It think I was actually sweating at that point. Can we agree this is the best mob movie every?
Totally. Best ever. Outside of The Godfather Parts 1, 2, and 3.
