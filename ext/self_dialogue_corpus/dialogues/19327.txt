So, listen to anything fun today?
Im done with podcasts for the day so ive just been bumping that chillhop station
the one with the anime girls doing homework?
Haha, yeah.
That stuff is so good!
I totally agree.
Its great for getting work done.
Yeah, whenever I put it on the time just flows by.
The beats really help me relax, too.
Yeah, it puts me in a flow state.
I kind of want to put it on now, even though I have nothing to do!
I bet you could get plenty done with that on though.
You think so?
Yeah, when I listen to that chill beat I just become productive.
I do have things on my to do list.
There you go! Time to get busy!
Well, this turned out better than expected.
Happy to help!
I am totally blasting some chill hop now.
Word, turn it up loud friend.
