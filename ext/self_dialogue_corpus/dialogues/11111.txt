I was in the bank yesterday, and the woman who helped me was wearing the most amazing shoes.
What were they like?
Well, to me they looked like something you'd wear to a dungeon. Black leather, tall heels, open toes, and a belt around your foot.
Oh, I've seen those. Like a belt you might see on a motorcycle jacket, with a big buckle.
Yes! A big shiny buckle. I wanted those shoes.
I think I want them too. But they can't be comfortable to wear to work all day.
No, probably not. But the woman I saw didn't care.
She probably put her feet up at lunch. Or went barefoot.
I'm amazed the bank let her wear those.
Yeah, not very corporate. I'd wear mine at night.
Well, it depends on your job, of course. Like if you sit all day, you could stand it, and nobody would see them.
Then you could dance in them at night.
Uhm, they're not really built for dancing, either.
Yeah, you might fall and hurt yourself.
You're already hurting yourself, just wearing them.
Hey, you can't wear running shoes all the time.
And heels look so elegant.
Sometimes fashion hurts. That's just the way it is.
Yeah. Somebody should make shoes that look good and feel good too.
That'd be a strange new look.
