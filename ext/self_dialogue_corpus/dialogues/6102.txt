Have you seen Moana   yet ?
I have  I  really liked  the chicken
It did  really  seem like he  stayed in  trouble
My  favorite is  how the water kept  putting  him back on  the boat
The  whole movie was  great    and I liked the message
I really liked  that  the rock from wwe  played  a  huge roll.
And he  did all of his own singing  .
I also  thought the   grandma  in this  was  quite  beuatiful  as she  became part of  the ocean
Did  you see  how she  was leading them as a  sting  ray
It was just a  great movie  about  family
