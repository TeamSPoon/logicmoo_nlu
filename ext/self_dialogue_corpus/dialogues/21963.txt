Have you ever seen Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory?
Yes, it's one of my favorite movies!
Mine too!
Who is your favorite character?
I really like Mike T.V.
Yes, that kid is such a brat.
I know! I liked Veruka as well.
She was so awful to her father.
I know!
Can you imagine talking to your parents like that?
No. Violet was a real monster as well!
Is she the one that ate the blueberry?
Yes, and she turned into a giant blueberry!
That's right!
Yes, then they had to send her to the juicing room.
Yes, I remember that!
And the boy Augustus, what happened to him?
He was the one that fell into the chocolate lake.
That's right, he got sucked up into the tube.
That part was hilarious!
