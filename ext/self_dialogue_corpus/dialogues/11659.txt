OK, favorite Beatles song. Go!
Hmm, I really like Eleanor Rigby
That one? For real?
What's wrong with Eleanor Rigby?
It's a little sad, no? I'm more a Sgt. Pepper person myself.
I like the dark tone. It's very poignant.
I suppose. What record is that one again?
Yellow Submarine!
Oh yeah, have you seen the movie? We should watch it!
Let's do it!
