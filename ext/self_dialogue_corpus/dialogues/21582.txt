What is you favorite animated movie?
I think my favorite is Lady in the Tramp.
I liked that one too. But isn't it old?
Yes it is a classic but the classics are the best!!
Why do you like the classics?
Because they reinforced things like morals and values.
And you don't think they do that now?
No not really. Now it is all about making that almighty dollar no matter what the message is.
What do you mean?
Do take me wrong, I love the movies but I hate their messages. But take Beauty and the Beast by Disney.
Ok that is a good movie about hard work and believing in oneself will allow one to change.
Maybe, but it also shows that a man can be abusive and it's ok, or the towns people can be bullies with no repercussions.
I never looked at it that way.
It also shows that a woman should not be seen as smart or aggresive for what she believed in.
How so?
Well Belle's love of knowledge became a push point for the bullies and Gaston to prey upon.
Ok I can see that. But why have I never noticed it before?
Because society has allowed those things to become an everyday occurrence which has made them acceptable.
Wow I will never watch that movie and see it the same way again.
I know... this is why I love the classics.
