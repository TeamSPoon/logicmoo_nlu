Did you like Daredevil?
No I thought it was too generic.
I agree the acting was formulaic.
It was one of the bombs for the industry.
Thats insane that it could happen.
Well it was the boom for the film industry.
I just dont think enough people knew about Daredevil.
The character has been further developed no then 15 years ago
Was that when it was released?
Hard to believe but yes.
