Hey, what was the first Disney movie you ever saw as a kid?
Oh, the Little Mermaid was the first.
Really, why that one?
It was my birthday and my mom took me to see it in the theater.
That's cool. Is it your favorite Disney movie then?
Most definitely. I love the songs.
Kiss the Girl is a classic.
It is, lots of musicians like to cover it.
Do you like the villain?
Ursula is my queen.
