What is your favorite Major League Baseball team right now?
I like the Chicago Cubs the best.
Were you happy when they won the World Series last year in 2016?
Of course! That was their first World Series win since 1908?
It was a great series.  I was surprised the Cleveland Indians did not win.
They are not doing very well this year.  The Indians are currently only second in the American League Central.
The best team in the American League right now is the Houston Astros.
Their pitching is excellent. Dallas Keuchel is off to a strong start!
He could win the American League Cy Young Award this year.
I think Ervin Santana has a chance too.
Who is the best pitcher in the National League right now?
I think Clayton Kershaw is.
True, but even with Kershaw, the Los Angeles Dodgers will not win the National League West division.
Only because the Colorado Rockies are so dominant right now.
Their offense is incredible. Mark Reynolds could be the National League MVP this year.
But Ryan Zimmerman is having a better season now.
I cannot wait to see the Rockies play the Nationals this year.
I think the Rockies and the Nationals will be finalists in the National League Playoffs.
And the winner will face Houston in the 2017 World Series.
I think the Rockies will play the Baltimore Orioles in the 2017 World Series.
