Did you catch the playoff game last night?
You mean the Celtics versus the Wizards blowout?
Yeah, the Celts killed it.
Bradley was on fire all night. It was a good game.
They're up 3-2 now. There's noway the Wizards can come back from that.
I wouldn't count them out just yet.
You think so?
They could pull an upset and turn the series around.
I don't know. After last night's game I don't see it happening.
Wall did a pretty good job for the Wizards. He was the highest scorer I think.
Yeah but it wasn't enough.
Don't forget, the Celtics did have home court advantage too.
You implying that my team can't win on the road?
You said it, not me.
We'll see. The Wizards are at home for the next game.
They have to win or at least put up a better fight than last night.
It should be interesting, but I don't expect the Wizards to pull off a win.
Do you want to bet on it?
Fifty dollars says the Celtics will wrap it up Friday night.
Deal.
