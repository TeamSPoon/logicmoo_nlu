Have you seen any good movies lately?
I saw Wonder Woman
did you like it?
It was good, but Lynda Carter will always be wonder woman to me.
Emily Carey was ok, but she is young and inexperienced.
yeah, and I saw where she was complaining because Man of Steel actor was paid more
Of course he was, Superman Man is a much bigger seller than Wonder Woman.
That's what I was thinking.
Did you see the movie Enemy Mine?
no what is that about
It's an older movie, but Dennis Quade and Louise Gossett Jr starred in it.
what was it about
A human and an alien get stranded on a hostile planet and have to learn to get along to survive
Sounds interesting, is there a lot of action?
yes, they find out the planet is a mining planet, and humans have enslaved aliens to mine the ore.
do they free them?
they do in the end, but only after the baby that the alein has is captured.
The alien has a baby?
yeah, it's kinda weird, but it's a good movie.
I'll have to give it a try
