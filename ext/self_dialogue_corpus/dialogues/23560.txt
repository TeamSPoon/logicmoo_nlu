So what do you think of the Marvel Cinematic Universe so far?
I've been really impressed. Their movies have been all so good so far.
Tell me about it. My favorite one so far is Civil War.
That's a good choice, but mine's a bit different.
Oh, really? What is it?
It's actually Ant-Man.
Really? I won't argue, but just tell me why.
I thought it was a lot more relatable as far as the characters are concerned.
I mean, I guess that makes sense.
I just thought it was nice that the stakes were a bit smaller this time around.
True. Normally the heroes have to save entire cities from being destroyed.
Exactly. It was nice that for once, it focused on one guy trying to save his family rather than an entire city.
True. And for what it was, Paul Rudd fit perfectly.
He did! It felt like such a natural role for him.
I also thought that Michael Pena's character was hilarious.
Yes! Easily one of the most entertaining parts of the whole film.
Also, the movie's visuals were on a whole other level.
Agreed! Seeing everything upscaled was such a treat for the eyes.
I take back my doubts. Ant-Man was a pretty solid movie.
See, just because a movie doesn't have the Avengers in it doesn't make it any less good!
