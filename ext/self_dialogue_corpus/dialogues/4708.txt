Did you hear about what Cincinnati's Joey Votto said to that kid?
No, why, what happened?
Cincinnati was playing in San Francisco, and this kid asked Votto if he could have his batting gloves.
Ok, that sounds like the type of thing players get asked a lot.
Yes, But Votto's answer wasn't what a lot of players would have said!
Why, what did he say?
He told the kid that he was sitting in the front row and that he was 'elite'.
You mean like he's saying this kid isn't worthy of his gloves?
Exactly! He said the kid was privileged and not some "Make A Wish: kid.
Ouch! That seems awfully harsh for a baseball star!
I know, you'd think he could've handled it better.
There are nicer ways of saying no than calling a kid 'elite' and 'privileged'!
Yes, I thought it made Votto look pretty classless.
It makes him sound like he's not it in for the fans, just for being praised when he helps out needy kids.
I sure bet that one kid didn't have any praise for him.
I bet he had a new favorite team immediately after that.
You almost couldn't blame the kid if he was rude back.
I know. That's what you teach kids when you're rude to them!
It's not like the kid did anything terrible.
No he didn't. You'd think players would want to encourage all young fans, even if h didn't give his gloves to him.
