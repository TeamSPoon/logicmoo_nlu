Who makes the strangest thrillers?
I'd probably have to say David Lynch.
David Lynch, what did he do again?
He did Blue Velvet, Twin Peaks, Lost Highway, Mulholland Drive.
Oh, Mulholland Drive. I remember watching that one.
Yeah? What did you think?
To be honest, I didn't really understand it. Was part of it a dream?
It took me a second watch to fully get what was going on, but yes, it turns out that most of the movie is a dream.
I remember doing a lot of mental work and being frustrated despite getting really engaged in certain parts of the film.
It's a difficult film, but it rewards the repeat viewer
