Which of the Star Wars droids is your favorite?
Doesn't everyone love R2-D2?
Yes, although I think C-3PO is my favorite?
I always found him a little too prim and proper.
Yes, the accent can be annoying sometime.
Not just that, but the whole idea of a protocol droid.
Yes.    Why would a child like Annakin build such a thing?
Maybe it was a kit that he was working from.
Perhaps.     Maybe best to not take that part of the series too literally.
Yes, it is just a space fantasy!
