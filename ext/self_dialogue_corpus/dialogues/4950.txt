How can you watch this stuff? It's so boring.
What? Baseball? It's an exciting game
Excting? Right. Because watching dudes run in a circle after a ball. Real fun.
It is! You just have to understand the game.
I understand the game. I don't understand how you can like it.
Well, I use to play in high school so...
Did you? Did you wear the super tight pants too?
Of course. And my bum looked great.
Haha. So who is winning?
The Braves. The are up by 4 and it's the last inning.
Looks like they are going to win the whole thing,
Maybe. The guy up to bat now isn't very good. He could mess up the whole thing for everyone.
Why do they let him bat then?
They have to. Part of the rules.
Well, that's dumb.
Agreed. But it is what it is.
I guess. The only good thing about baseball is all the food.
You are ridiculous.
What? Hotdogs and beer.
I guess.
