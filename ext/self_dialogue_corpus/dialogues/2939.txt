Do you think the Cleveland browns are as bad as everyone says?
Yes,I think they are going to be pretty bad again.
Who is the starting quarterback?
I think it's going to be Brock Osweiler myself.
I agree with you.
They have strengthened the offensive line.
Yes they did.
I'm thinking they only win 4 maybe 5 games.
That seems to be the general consensus.
They should be more competitive though.
They have to be somewhat better than last year.
If they win two games they are better.
That's a great point.
How is,their schedule?
It looks pretty soft.
Well they open at home with the steelers.
Well that's not a good start.
No,they should lose that one.
Then they have the ravens,colts,bengals and jets in a row.
Definitely some winnable games there
