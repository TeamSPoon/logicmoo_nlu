Have you seen Frozen?
Who hasn't seen that movie?
Well what did you think about it?
Well at first I hated it but then I learned to really appreciate it.
I thought it was too much of a basic storyline.
No way! It was the first Disney movie to star two female leads that weren't going after a man.
Ok, but they could've done without that stupid song, what was it called?
Let it Go, which is what you should do.
That song wont get out of my head now!
Yet another reason as to why it was such a good movie, it stays with you!
