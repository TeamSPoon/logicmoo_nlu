What do you think of Born This Way?
You mean The Lady Gaga song?
Yes that would be the one.
I think it's great that it's so positive towards The LGBTQ community.
I agree, they could use a positive message.
Absolutely, I certainly like it as a song better than Poker Face.
See I prefer Poker Face.
Why exactly do you prefer that one?
I simply like the chorus and the beat better.
Fair enough, she's really talented.
