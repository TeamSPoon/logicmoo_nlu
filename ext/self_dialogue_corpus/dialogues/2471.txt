Where are you from?
I live in Boston now but I'm actually from a town right outside Boston called Foxborough?
That's where the Gillette Stadium is right?
Yes! Have you been to Foxborough??
No, but I've seen it many times on ESPN. Gillette is home to the New England Patriots.
Yes, as a matter of fact it is. So you're a fan of the Patriots?
No. I don't watch much football. My boyfriend watches it all the time and he supports Patriots.
I have been a Patriots fan for many years now. They're the best!
Are they really the best, or do you only support them because they're based in your hometown?
A bit of both I guess. I like being local to my community.
It helps that the team in your community is very popular. My boyfriend has only been supporting them since they won Superbowl a couple years ago.
I support them whether or not they win.
Just to get on my boyfriend's nerve I sometimes say that I'm a Jets fan.
If he's a true Patriots fan he probably gets very angry at you!
Why? I don't get it.
The NY Jets are our enemies! The Jets Vs Patriots is one of the most bitter rivalries in the NFL.
Are they any good?
Yes, they are. Not as good the Patriots of course
Oh, of course not!
Patriots til I die!!
