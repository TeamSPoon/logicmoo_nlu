Can McPhee build a winner in Vegas?
No I dont think so, theyll go through growing pains.
The NHL is doing a good job trying to get them to be good quickly.
I dont agree, they cant select primo players.
Well its not a good start when you can protect more than half your roster.
I think you have it wrong.
Even if I do, the players they get to pick from wont be superstars
Not every team even has one so theyll be fine.
They should have the first pick in the entry draft as well.
I hate the idea of a lottery.
Its to prevent teams from tanking.
You cant tank in a sport like this.
Yes you can, play the worst players.
True but what about goalies?
Theyll have a pick of a good goalie.
Who do you think they look at?
Neuvirth.
Why him?
He has the connection with McPhee.
Yeah but hes just not good at all.
