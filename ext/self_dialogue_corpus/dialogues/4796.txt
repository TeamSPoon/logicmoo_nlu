Have you heard about MLB agreement with Facebook?
No, what is it?
The MLB agrees to let facebook a game every Friday with no blackouts.
Sweet, I'm looking forward to those knowledgeable intelligent Facebook team fans commenting on the game.
Yeah, this is pretty cool. I like the gradual movement to actually streaming games.
No blackouts is nice too.
I wonder what the first game on Facebook will be
Its like the free game of the day, but more people have facebook accounts then mlb.com ones
I think this could work, we'll have to see though.
Good on MLB for making steps to modernity.
Do you need an account for the MLB free game?
The free game of the day still has blackout restrictions. So, it's even more than that.
I don't have a Facebook account. I hope I don't need one.
You don't? Everyone is on Facebook.
I'm not. I don't trust them.
But if I have to make an account just to watch a game, it won't happen.
Are you serious?
I am dead serious. Facebook can't be trusted.
So how does this work? Is there a page I'm supposed to follow/like to see the games?
I'm sure if you follow the main MLB page they will provide a link to the game.
