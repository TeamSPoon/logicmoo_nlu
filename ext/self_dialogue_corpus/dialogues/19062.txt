Hey, how you doing? What's that you're listening to?
Oh, this? This is the new album from 2 Chainz.
Oh, is that hip hop? I've never really been into that.
Yeah, but I think you would like this.
What's it called? The new album?
It's called "Pretty Girls Like Trap Music".
Wow, sounds neat already. What do you like about it?
Mostly the energy the songs have.
Oh really, does it make you wanna dance?
Ha, yeah, it does. The lyrics are pretty catchy too.
Well, it does sound pretty nice, I gotta admit
Trust me, I'm not a huge hip hop fan but I liked it.
Well, you've sold me on listening atleast. Tell me more?
The songs all feel unique to me, you know?
LIke each one is its own type of song?
Yeah, that's a good way of putting it.
Wow, this really does sound pretty good. I like it!
I had a feeling you would. You should listen to some of his other music. It's pretty big right now.
Let's go get some coffee, and you can tell me some more.
No problem, I've got my playlist ready.
