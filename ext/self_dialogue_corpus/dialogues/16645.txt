Did you hear the new Katy Perry song?
No.  Thankfully.
Why?  You don't like her?
Yes, I can't stand her music.
But, she's the voice of a generation!
Which generation?
The generation that knows nothing about music!
Clearly.  Now i'm going to have to hear her songs on the radio all the time.
Yes, whenever a new Katy Perry song comes out, they must play it four times every hour.
That way, if you don't like her music, you eventually will.
No, I think most people just continue to like it, unfortunately.
I don't understand how she's so popular.
The outfits and the colors might have something to do with it.
That and maybe running around half naked.
Yes, let's not forget the half nakedness!!
Seriously, I hate her music.
Even the song, Firework?
Yes, even that song.
It has a good message though.
It does.  I'll give her that one.
