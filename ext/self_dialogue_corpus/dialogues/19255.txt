What song would you say summarizes your 20s?
That's kind of an odd question. Do you have a song that summarizes YOUR 20s?
Yep, and one that summarizes my teenaged years too.
Wow, you put quite a bit of thought into summarizing your own life in music!
Haha, now you make me sound like a weirdo! I think a lot of people do this.
Yeah, I'm just giving you a hard time. Let me think here...
The song I'd choose for my 20s is 'How Soon is Now' by the Smiths.
That is a great song. But a sad one.
Yeah, my 20s weren't all that great, really.
Sorry, man. At least your 30s seem to be going well.
Yep, the music that would summarize my 30s would be quite a bit happier!
I think for me, I might choose 'Feeling Good', Nina Simone version.
I guess your 20s were a lot better than mine, then.
Maybe that's overly optimistic a take, but I really love that song.
It's a wonderful song. So many artists have covered it and done really cool versions.
Did you ever hear the version that the band Muse did of it?
No, what's it like.
It's more of a thrash or punk or at least hard rock version. It was pretty cool.
I imagine I'd like the Nina Simone version bettter.
Well, I do too, but the Muse version was neat as well.
