I just saw Episodes 4 5 and 6 recently, what should I watch next?
You should watch Episodes 1 2 and 3 next!
Are they any good? I've heard mixed reviews
They are great, don't worry about the haters
What do the haters say?
They don't like the plot, Jar Jar Binks, or sometimes the cheesy effects
I will watch them today!
Will you have time?
Yeah, I will start with Episode 1 and see Young Anakin!
he is a great character who earns to fight well and he changes a lot so pay attention!
