Is it too early to write off the Panthers?
What? Dude, you're crazy.
I don't know. You think Cam's still got it?
Dang, man. He's what, 28? Of course he's still got it.
Alright. Just seems like he's too sensitive, you know? Like he's got just a tiny bit of Vince Young in him.
That's crazy, man. Just silly. I mean, how about we start with a decent O-line for him?
Ok, ok. I'm willing to go with that. So he's got some big boys blocking up front. He's still going to run.
Uh. Yeah. And that's what's so great. I mean, he's no joke.
But what about injuries?
Injuries happen. Cam needs an O-line. Then get back to me with your complaints.
What about the division overall?
What, the NFC South? Yeah, well, you know, you've got a lot of talent. Maybe too much talent.
The A going to get back to the Superbowl?
It's hard. That's just hard to do.
True. What do you think though?
Atlanta has the best shot to win the division. Tampa will be right in the thick of it. I mean, look, you've got Cam, Ryan, Brees, and Winston? That's absurd.
Too much of a good thing?
Good competition. Just only one can get out. Saints aren't going to do it. Really, though, any one of the other three very well could.
Who do you want?
Want? The Falcons. For sure.
