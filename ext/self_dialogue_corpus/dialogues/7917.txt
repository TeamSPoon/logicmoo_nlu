You really need to listen to One Republic.
Who are they again? The name sounds familiar.
They have a song called "Secrets" which I really like.
I think I know that song!
Yes and they also did a song with Timbaland back in 2006 or 2007 called "Apologize."
Oh now that one I do remember!
It has a lot of memories for me because I met my husband at that time.
Oh how cool!
Yes so the song "Apologize" by One Republic holds a lot of meaning for me.
I can see that! It is a fantastic song.
