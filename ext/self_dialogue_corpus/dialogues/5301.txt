Have you ever seen some of the older Disney movies?
I have seen some.  Which ones are your favorites?
I love Bambi and The Little Mermaid.  They are classics.
I have seen The Little Mermaid but I have never taken the time to watch Bambi.
It was one of the first Disney movies that I ever saw so it holds a special place in my heart.
Doesn't Bambi's mother get killed in the movie?
She does but they move the storyline along quickly enough for it to be a kids movie.  Besides, someone always seems to be killed in a Disney movie.
That is true which confuses me sometimes because they are all really kids movies.
I think that kids don't really pay attention to that and it probably bothers adults more.
That is true.  In Beauty and the Beast, my kids just love the music and Belle and don't really care that Gaston dies in the end.
