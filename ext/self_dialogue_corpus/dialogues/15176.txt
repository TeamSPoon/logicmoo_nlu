So, what do you think of Nicki Minaj?
Oh, I like her music, just not her videos.
Did you see the one for Anaconda?
Yeah, I liked most of it but couldn't watch it with my little sister.
I didn't like the lyrics.  She sure is pretty, though.
I like when she gets together with other singers, like when she sang with Jessie J in "Bang Bang."
Oh, yeah, I like that song, too.  DIdn't they both sing with Ariana Grande?
Yup, all three got together on stage with "Bang Bang."
Ludacris did a song with Nicky singing, too, yeah?
Yup, that was "My Chick Bad", back in 2010.
She also sang in "Monster" with Kanye!
I love her lips, I think they're great.
Her lips and her huge booty, but she's pretty proud of her booty.
That's because she's not oddly shaped; everything matches up well on her body.
So, what's her latest song out now?
Well, she dropped 3 new ones back in March:   "Regret In Your Tears," "Changed It," and "No Frauds."
Yeah, Lil Wayne sung with her on "Changed It".
She was talking to Remy Ma Beef when she rapped, ""Tried to drop 'Another One,' you was itchin' to scrap / You exposed your ghostwriter, now you wish you were scrapped / Heard your pussy on 'Yuck,' I guess you needed a pap / What type of bum bitch shoot a friend over a rap,"
I definitely love some hip-hop.
Yeah, Nicki Minaj is one of the best.
