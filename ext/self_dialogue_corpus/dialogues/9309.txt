What's up with Young Thug?
Idk man, he's basically become Lil Wayne 2.0
He looks downright drugged out in that Mamacita video
Yeah, seeing him flail around like that is weird
I did like Mamacita a lot
No doubt, that song is great.
Okay, what's your favorite Schoolboy Q track?
Gotta go with Collard Greens! Kendrick Lamar is so good on it
He does own that song. The beat to that track..
It's amazing. I still listen to that weekly
