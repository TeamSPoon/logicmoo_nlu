Hey there!  Have you seen any good movies lately?
Not really.  I haven't been paying attention to movies lately.
Why is that?
Well, I'm a bit burnt out.  I get excited about new movies, and then they end up being terrible.
I can understand that; what you need is to watch some classic movies.  I like comedies myself.
I enjoy comedy movies.  What would you suggest?
Well, I know it's a bit lame now, but I've always enjoyed older Adam Sandler movies.
Oh yeah!  Like Happy Gilmore?
Yeah, that's a great one!  He plays a golfer with natural skill, and destroys the PGA tour with his loud mouth and skills.
That sounds like a good choice.  I'll give it a watch; thanks!
