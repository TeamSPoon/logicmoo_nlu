Did you see Monsters, Inc.
Yeah
What did you think of the story
I thought the whole idea was cool, how they started getting people to laugh instead of cry
It is funny that all the bad guys did was scare people
You know what the funniest part of the movie was? It was when the green guy was covered by the company logo on the commercial
I don't remember that.
The city of monsters was an interesting concept
You understood why they wanted to scare kids
I liked the scare meter scenes
