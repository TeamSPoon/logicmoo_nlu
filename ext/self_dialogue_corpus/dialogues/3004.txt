How many superbowls have there been?
Hm, well the NFL has been around for almost 100 years, right?
Yeah, but I don't think superbowls started when the NFL started.
That's weird, I wonder why.
I guess they didn't come up with the superbowl yet until later.
Definetely, I think the first one was in 1967.
Darn, that's 40 something years after the NFL formed.
Yeah, I think only a handful of teams have ever won.
Definetely, it's unlikely all 32 have won.
Yep, just from a probability standpoint.
I think the Packers have won the most.
Yep, Patriots in a close second, probably.
Patriots? I would say the Steelers.
Nah, they're good but they aren't THAT good.
You know 27 superbowls have been in only 3 cities?
Wow, really?
Yep, New Orleans, Los Angeles, and Miami.
That's interesting, places that are already extremely populated.
Yeah, the superbowl stats are so interesting.
Agreed, they are.
