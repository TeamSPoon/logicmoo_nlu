What was your favorite Star Wars Movie?
Return of the Jedi, you?
I, for one, loved The Force Awakens.
Yea, but there is nothing quite like the originals.
Of course not, but the special effects are way different now, I enjoy those.
What about the plot lines, the character development?
What about it?
The newer movies just don't capture the same magic the original trilogy did.
Yes they do! Don't you think they covered the gaping hole of the death stars weakness int he last movie?
Yes, because they had to. Just like they had to kill Han Solo.
