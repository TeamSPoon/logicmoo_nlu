I just found out that Will Smith used to be a rapper.
Yes, he rapped the opening song to Fresh Prince of Bel Air.
But he did more than that.
He did?I didn't know that.
He was in a movie called The Wild Wild West and rapped the song for the movie.
I wasn't aware of that.
He also had a hit called Parents Just Don't Understand.
I had no idea he was a rap artist.
I know. Most people see him as an actor
He;s really talented.
