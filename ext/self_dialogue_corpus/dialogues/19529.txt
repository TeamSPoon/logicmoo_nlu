I remember when everyone thought K-Pop was going to take over the music industry. I guess that didn't happen.
It was silly to think it ever would.
I mean, I kind of get it.  Psy had a couple hits, and there are a few big groups like Girls' Generation, but no way South Korea could dominate the entire music industry.
Girls' Generation is pretty big though. Japan loves them, too.
It's not surprising, Japan has been big for idol groups for a long time.
Oh, I suppose so. They even have virtual idols.
Yep, like Miku Hatsune, and the other Vocaloids. Which, to be fair, is a pretty decent music making program.
Don't forget all those video game idols they have too, like in the Idolmaster and Love Live games.
I never really got much into the idol stuff. I like Babymetal though.
Babymetal kind of feels like a parody of idol groups to me.
Maybe, but it's more of an affectionate parody in that case. They're a fun group.
What's your favorite song by them?
Probably either "Megitsune", or "Doki Doki Morning".
I like "Awadama Fever" from their newest album best.
That one came out last year, right? I wonder when they'll make another album.
It might be a while, they really blew up and now they've been touring a lot.
If their live shows are anything like their music videos I bet it's a fun time. Their videos are really creative.
Yeah, they're pretty cool. It's hard not to like them.
People try though, but Rob Zombie has their backs. He defended them against people who said they weren't a real metal group.
Oh yeah, they met him, and Rob Halford, too. They know a lot of famous musicians; if anyone will take over the industry it'll those kids.
