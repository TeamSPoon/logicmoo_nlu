Hey. Have you seen any good movies lately.
Not any that were amazing. The last one I saw was just ok.
What was it.
It was called The Space Between Us.
What was it about?
It was about a boy who grew up on Mars and came to try and live on Earth, even though they didn't think he could.
That sounds interesting. Why was it just ok.
It was a good story line but I would of just liked more from it.
I get it. Who was in it?
Asa Butterfield and Britt Robertson.
I've never heard of them.
They are fairly new. Have you seen any good movies?
The last movie I saw was the new Pirates of the Caribbean.
Did you like it?
I was honestly really disappointed with it.
Why?
It just did not have a good plot and was very slow through the majority of it.
Oh, that stinks. I really liked those movies.
Me too and I love Johnny Depp, but I was just disappointed.
Maybe I will have to wait to see it when it comes out on video then.
