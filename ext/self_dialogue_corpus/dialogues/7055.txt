One Disney movie I didn't watch much growing up was Sleeping Beauty.
I did watch that when I was little but it wasn't a fave.
Did you like the Jungle Book?
I loved that when I was little! My favorite was the big bear.
Me too he was pretty funny.
Another great Disney movie was Snow White and the little Dwarfs.
Yes that is a definite classic! I loved it.
Which of the dwarfs was your favorite?
I would say probably Grumpy, I can relate the most to him.
I agree with you there!
