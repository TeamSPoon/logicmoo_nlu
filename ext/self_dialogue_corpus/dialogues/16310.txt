Are you a big Dan Fogelberg fan?
No, I don't believe so. What songs did he sing?
"The Power of Gold," "Make Love Stay," and "Leader of the Band" are some of his songs.
Do you like him?
Of course! I first started to listen to him after his 1982 "Greatest Hits" album and haven't stopped since.
That's a good name for a singer.
It is a good name indeed.
He was on Epic Records for a while.
Is that so?
Yes, "Greatest Hits" came out on that company.
Do you only listen to greatest hits albums?
Sometimes I'll buy the original too but I won't know what to do with a lot of the songs.
What do you mean?
They're just not that good.
Why don't you just download the songs you like and skip the ones you don't?
I don't know. I like cassettes too much.
I'm sorry to hear that.
I'm sorry too.
Is Fogelberg still alive?
I believe so, yes.
