What was your favorite Beatles album?
This is really a hard one to pick.
I will start it off than. I really liked Revolver. This album changed the way people thought of albums.
Good pick,but clearly Sgt Pepper is the best.
Why? What is your argument?
Simple,while Revolver was a new thing we will find Sgt. Pepper was the GOAT of albums.
Yea,but I still like Revolver better. It even had a better album cover.
Well, if we are going to talk album covers that it doesn't get more iconic than Sgt.Pepper's album cover.
Well, I guess we agree to disagree.
Well,we can agree ob one thing both Revolver and Sgt. Pepper are iconic albums.
