What's that brown guy on Star Wars called?
Chewbacca?
Yeah! I want to watch a Star Wars movie with him in it.
I think he's in all of them. The first one for sure.
Hm, maybe I'll watch the first one. I just think he's so cute!
I like him, too. And Yoda.
I've never watched any so I want to try and get into them.
Yeah, start with the first one. It will help you understand the series.
I'm turning it on right now.
Let me know how you feel about it!
