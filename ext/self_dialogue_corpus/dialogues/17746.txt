What do you think of Cane Brown?
I don't know who that is. Is he a music artist?
Yeah, he's a younger artist but up and coming.
Oh ok. What kind of music does he sing?
It's mostly country, but it kind of has a pop feel to it too.
Oh that sounds like something I would like.
You should try to search for some of his songs. He has a really deep and rustic voice.
I just looked him up. Is he really only 23?
Yeah! He's really young but has a lot of talent.
He must be good because it looks like he has his own tour.
I really think in a few years he is going to be the next George Strait. His voice is so unique.
I'm not sure if anyone can come close to George Strait. He is a classic!
I know, but give one of his albums a chance. My favorite is his Chapter 1 album.
I can't believe he is 23 and already has albums out. That's great.
I'm telling you, he's a really great artist!
I believe you. I'm looking for his album right now so I can download it.
When do you, check out his song titled Excuses.
Sounds good. It does help that he's a really good looking guy too!
Oh I know! He is so popular with the early 20s crowd. He's easy on the eyes.
Thanks for the heads up, I'm excited to give his music a listen.
