What is some music you are listening to right now?
I am listening to chance the rapper.
Oh I heard he is very good.
Yeah he is good and he does great things for the community.
That is great!
I like his song Dear Theodosia.
I will have to take a listen to that.
That is from Hamilton.
Interesting.
Have you heard the songs from Hamilton.
I would have to say I have not.
Well definitely either see the show or get the sountrack.
I will try to do either of those things soon.
I also llike Childish Gambino.
Isn't he an actor also?
Comedian? Yes he is.
That is rather strange.
Yes but he is rather talented so do not knock him.
I wont! Anyways it was nice talking to you.
Good talking to you too!
