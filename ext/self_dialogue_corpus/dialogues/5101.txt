Hi.
Hello.
How are you?
Well and you?
Not bad.  You into baseball?
Yeah I enjoy baseball.
Ever seen a game live?
Yeah I've been to a few Braves games.
Turner Field is a cool ballpark.
Yeah I always liked it.
Aren't they moving to a new stadium?
Yeah pretty soon.
Why are they doing that?
Honestly I don't know, easier to get to maybe?
And Turner field really isn't that old?
No, built it in the mid 90s I think.
That must cost a fortune for a new stadium.
Yeah, probably why the braves sold all their good players.
Ouch.
Yeah it was rough.
