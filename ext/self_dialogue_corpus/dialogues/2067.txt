Hey how do you think the Bills will do this year?
Probably suck as usual.
Hey don't be so pessimistic, have some hope!
I lost hope years ago.
How could you??
Well they haven't made the playoffs in what, 17 years?
Yeah something like that...
Yeah...it's pathetic
Well their luck has to turn around some time, don't you think?
Probably, but I've learned not to get my hopes up.
Well the games are still a good excuse to get wasted!
True!
So you see no chance of the Bills even making the playoffs??
Maybe, i don't know..like I said I don't get my hopes up.
Well i shall remain hopeful!
Good for you.
So who do you think will be good this year?
I don't know, The Lions?
Because you like cats?
Yep!
