Remember when we went to New York City to watch the Broadway production of "The Lion King"?
Yeah, It was awesome! Especially during the openning scene, when the animals were all around!
Yeah. Pretty nice.
You don't sound enthusiastic about your comment. What's wrong?
Oh, I was just remebering the movie and the first time I watched it. It made me so sad.
When Mufassa died?
Yeah.
The good news with the movie is that you can rewatch the first part of the movie, before Mufsssa died, and see him alive again.
True.
You just have to stop the video before the bad part!
