What is going to be the story line of the NFL this season?
It's who can compete with the Patriots of course.
I think you are right.  What teams are going to be good this year.
The NFL is always so hard to predict because of the salary cap.
True, but do you have any teams in mind that could break through.
Probably the Texans and Titans.
Really the Titans?
They weren' too far off last year and they added some nice pieces.
I do like their Quarter Back.
Marcue Marriota is really good for the Titans.
They also play in a division that is getting better.
Yes, Houston and Indianapolis should be better, and even the Jaguars.
Have you ever been to a Titans game?
No I haven't but I want to.
I went to a game in San Diego last year between the Chargers and Raiders.
I bet that was fun.
It was great and the Raiders fans always travel well.
Those Raiders fans where some crazy costumes.
I know some of them are scarey looking!
Well their team mascot is a Pirate.
