Have you noticed that these "superhero" stories are really just old stories being re-told?
Yes, I noticed. It was quite apparent in the latest Wonder Woman.
What do you mean?
They heavily relied on Greek mythology.
Yes, I see. That's exactly what I mean. You can't get much older than stories from the ancient Greeks.
Yes, and much of Thor is from the Vikings which is about Norse mythology.
So, both Marvel and DC have stolen from the past.
Well, it's not really stolen. It's more re-interpreted.
Yes, I agree. But, I'll take it even further. They've improved them!
You're right! The new Wonder Woman movie is an amazing combination of old and new.
