What is what? Start with the scales.
Pentatonic and whole tone scales.
Ok, now you have to explain that. Why did or How did Debussy invent these?
Well, he didn't invent whole tone scales, Bach is the earliest one to have used them. They're scales where all the notes are separated by a whole step.;
So in C scale, the F gets a sharp and then all the notes after that also get a sharp?
WEll, you don't bee the B since A is sharped. So it goes C, D, E, F#, G#, A#, skip the B and to C.
Ah ok. But why?
Well the sense of direction you get is from the offsets in the scales.
Um i don;t get a sense of direction in a song
of course you do. You feel the tension building up, about to reach the climax, etc.
You're talking about sex.
Haha, very mature. No I'm talking about the musical pregression that occurs quite naturally due to the offset of the notes in scale.
ok fine, so whole tone scales have no offsets?
They don't have a very strong impression of a tonality
So it's atonal?
No, not atonal, whole tone scales doesn't have the sense of tonality.All the notes are same distance apart, so building the triads leads to augemented harmonies.
Wait, wait. Hold up. Too much too fast. Start over.
Whole tine scales do not have a very srtong sense of tonality or cente, because the notes are same distance apart.
I got that much.
So it creates this effect of an indistinct, directionless, almost, motion through the music.
