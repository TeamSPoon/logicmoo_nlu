Do you want to know the outcome.
I would prefer not to.
i was hoping to talk about it today but okay.
Sorry man.
Were you busy or just didn't watch it.
I had work to do sadly.
Oh well that would explain it.
I'm sorry again.
I just enjoy our baseball talks.

Well who do you think will win.
Obviously the Cubs.
Yeah I guess that was obvious.
They're my favorite team afterall.
