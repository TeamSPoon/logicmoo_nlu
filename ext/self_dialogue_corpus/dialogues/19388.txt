I'm torn about my opinion on the Grateful Dead
Yeah? How come?
Well, I think they are good, but I don't think they extraordinary like the Deadheads claim them to be.
I wouldn't say you are torn, it sounds like you have a pretty solid opinion on them.
Well, I guess I'm torn because sometimes I do like some of their solos but other times it can just drag on and go no where interesting.
Yes, I agree, there is a lot of guitar noodling, and I don't like that.
I'm also torn between whether I like their psychedelic stuff or more of their more folksy oriented material.
I'm not sure where diehard fans fall on this spectrum
Yeah, it may be impossible to tear the psychedelic element away from the folksy oriented element, but most Deadheads like the Workingman's Dead and American Beauty material the best.
And that is, what, folksy?
Yeah, more traditional and has more straightforward folk without the psychedelic-oriented material.
How else are you torn on them?
Well, I'm in the minority in that I tend to like their studio stuff better than listening to their live recordings.
That, my friend, is definitely a minority opinion - don't let other people hear you say that - blasphemy!
Yeah, I know. I do like to listen to some of their recent live stuff of their most recent tours, but I do tend to listen to a lot of their studio albums more often.
I think a lot of Deadheads feel they never quite could reach their potential in their studio efforts.
Yeah, I think that is common consensus, but the studio material tends to limit the soloing.
Yeah, you'd have 2 songs per album otherwise!
The Grateful Dead - you either love or hate 'em.
And the reasons you may love 'em may differ between person to person.
