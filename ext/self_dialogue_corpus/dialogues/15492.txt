What's the most interesting thing that you have ever seen done with a guitar?
I'd have to say the piano guitar method is pretty crazy.
What in the heck is that?
Piano guitar starts with placing the guitar face up in your lap.
That sounds like slide.
It's similar.  Or people will hold it like a stand up bass.
And what happens from there?
Well, multiple musical sections are comprised out of the two hands.
This is blowing my mind.
Generally, a bass line is tapped and slid out on the lower register.
I have got to hear this.
Then a chord pattern is tapped or strummed in the middle register.
Ok, now we've got a groove.
Then the melody is plucked or tapped in the higher register, all simultaneously.
That's fascinating.  Who is someone that I can check out?
I would recommend Stanley Jordan.
I bet one's fingers get worn out in a new kind of way.
Yes, mastering this method takes a tremendous amount of practice.
Do any other musicians accompany?
Generally, this is a one man show.
