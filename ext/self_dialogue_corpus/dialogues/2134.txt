What team do you think improved the most in the offseason.
The Giants, I think the addition of Marshall opens up their offense.
It sure does, no more double teams on OBJ.
Yep and they picked up a tight end in the draft.
Yeah, but I don't like drafting tight ends in the first round.
Why? It worked for them with Jeremy Shockey.
Yeah, but he was a bit of an outlier.
But guys like him and Gronk have changed the way offenses are run.
That's accurate.
Yeah, Tight ends used to be mostly used for blocking.
Now, I can't think of a team that doesn't use their end of receiving.
Absolutely, just a whole new world.
It's amazing how much the game has changed recently.
Yeah, it used to be that the spread offense was seen as a gimmick.
Yeah, now it seems to be everywhere.
Almost as if the pro-style offense is going away.
I think it'll always be around, but it's definitely losing its influence.
I think a resurgence is possible though.
Well, they say it's all circular.
Who knows, but the spread does make for some exciting and high-scoring games.
