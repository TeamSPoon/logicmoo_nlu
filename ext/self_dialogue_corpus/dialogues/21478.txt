What did you think of the Casino Royale Move?
Are you talking about the Peter Sellers spoof movie or the other one? I've seen both.
I mean the other one, the one with Daniel Craig as James Bond.
Ah, yes, the true Bond film, I liked it a lot. How about you?
I loved it. I agree it was the true Bond film.
I agree. The producers stuck to Ian Fleming's vision.
And Daniel Craig is my favorite Bond.
You think he was even better than Sean Connery? Why is that?
He played a more well-rounded character. Connery was suave as Bond, but something was missing.
I can see what you mean in some ways. Still, Connery did not play the role for comic effect as Roger Moore did.
Agreed, Moore thought the whole famous spy angle was a funny premise.
You make me want to watch Casino Royale again just to compare Craig to Moore and Connery.
You are forgetting the other Bond actors.
I almost did. What were their names again?
I think Timothy Dalton, Pierce Brosnan, and George Lazenby were the other Bonds.
Is that all of them? I think each was good in his own way.
Some played the role more as ab action hero while some took a less serious approach. I still prefer Craig.
I can see why now. He seems to combine all those aspects of Bond's personality into one.
Yes, this 007 has a mission and a history.
And we want to see more!
