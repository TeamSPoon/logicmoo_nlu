Who's your favorite actor?
I love Tom Hanks.
What has he played in lately?
He was in Inferno.
Is that based on one of those Dan Brown books?
Yes!
I really liked the Davinci Code, but I never saw Angels and Demons
I think the Davinci Code was the best of the three movies.
Those books create so much controversy.
I don't mind, but in all honesty, I miss his comedy days.
No comedy in Inferno?
No.  It was definitely a drama with action.
Should I see it?
It's worth watching.
Is there anyone else in the movie I might now?
The main character in Rogue One.
She was great.
She plays a very different role in Inferno.
I think I'll check it out.
Just be prepared for twists.
