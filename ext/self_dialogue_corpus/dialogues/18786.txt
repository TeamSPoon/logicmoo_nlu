I love rap music!
Same here so who is your favorite artist right now?
I really like Kendrick Lamar. He is definitely the King of Rap right now.
He is definitely a great rapper. I feel bad for Childish Gambino.
Gambino is also a great rapper. Why do you feel bad for him?
Did you hear he is quitting rap to just focus on acting? I am not sure why!
That is his choice you don't have to feel bad!
I just feel bad because I don't think he ever got the recognition he deserved as a rapper.
He definitely has some great songs. I was obsessed with his song Freaks and Greeks when it came out.
That is a great one. He is a much better rapper then he is actor but I guess he enjoys acting more.
Then if that is what he likes to do he should do that. Just because we like his music we can't force him to write it.
You are correct about that. I definitely need to just let Childish Gambino follow his heart.
Maybe someday he will miss rapping and want to come back to it.
I can only hope that happens! At least one of the last songs he ever wrote was incredible.
I haven't heard it yet. What is it called?
It is called Redbone. It is a great song.
Sounds interesting what do you like about it?
It is really unique. I have never heard Chilidish Gambino write a song just like this yet I still see it as one of his bests.
Sounds amazing I defintely will listen.
Great it was nice talking to you about Rap music!
