Would you like to watch a movie tonight?
Sure, what kind of movie are you in the mood for?
How about some type of thriller?
Sounds good, have you seen Flight Plan?
Is that the one with Jodie Foster?
Yes! She is really great in it.
I have liked her ever since I saw The Silence Of The Lambs.
Yea, what a creepy movie that was!
So now I am excited to watch Flight Plan.
You will not regret it!
