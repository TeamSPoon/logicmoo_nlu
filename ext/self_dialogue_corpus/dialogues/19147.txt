Who is your favorite cross over artist?
What do you mean by that?
Like an actor /singer someone like that .
Oh Jeniffer Lopez for sure.
Interesting  pick. She started on In living color.
I know I loved her since her fly girl days.
That was a great show. I loved the dance segments with them as well.
It is interesting that her first huge film role was selena about a singer.
True. I think they may have helped her be accepted as both singer and actor.
Ya it is hard because once the public views you one way very hard to change that molded vision.
Exactly I think a lot of people have failed in this area of crossover artist.
True but look at Justin timberlake he is a success example.
Also Lady Gaga. she won an emmy.
I still see her as a musician more than an actress, where J lo is both to me.
What about hailey stienfeld?
I was actually shocked to learn she sang some of the songs she does.
Ya I was surprised to learn she sang most girls.
I enjoy some of her work but I don't fully buy her as a pop singer.
I feel the same way, she doesn 't seem fully at ease in that "role".
I agree, I like her best in an acting capacity.
