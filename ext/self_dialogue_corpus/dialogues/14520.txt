Did you see the Minnesota Lynx win last night?
No, I don't watch women's basketball.  It's boring.
Are you kidding me?  So have you ever even seen them play?
No, why would I watch them?  Women are so much less aggressive and can't make shots
They are more skilled than you think.  You should give them a chance.  Watch a game.
Meh.  Maybe I'll turn it on for a few minutes next time.  When's the next game.
I'm not sure.  They don't always televise them.  Watching live in person is better anyway.
Why is that?
The Lynx have an amazing fan base and the energy they bring to the court is fantastic.
Where do they play?
They usually play at Target Center, but this year they are playing at Xcel because Target Center is being remodeled.
Target Center is a way better place to watch a basketball game.
I completely agree.  I can't wait until they're back there hitting threes!
Who do you think is their best player?
They've got so many great players it's hard to pick just one.  I'd probably say Maya Moore.  She's so talented.
Oh yeah?  I think I've heard of her.  Who else?
Lindsey Whalen.  Simone Augustus.  Syliva Fowles.
Why are the scores so low compared to men's basketball?
Well, the games are shorter, for one.  Also the women are a little shorter than a lot of male basketball players, so the men have it a little easier in that regard.
Oh, I see.  I didn't know the games were shorter.  Good to know.  I may just have to check it out.
