What do you think is the top fashion trend on 2017?
I think it would be the fact that everyone is wearing knitted and tight fitting clothing.
Really? I thought for sure it was all the bright stripes and colors that everyone seems to be wearing.
You know, that is a really good one too. I think there are a few new fashion trends this year.
A lot of girls are also wearing their bras out now.
Yeah, that is true. Though I'm not sure I am a big fan of that trend.
Personally, I will always be a big fan of the florals. They always seem to come back.
Yes! Florals reminds me of the 80's trend that is slowly coming back.
You're right. It seems more and more that people are dressing like they used to in the 80's and 90's.
Very true. A lot of times clothes don't even match anymore and everyone still seems to love it.
I do see that a lot. They wear colors like orange and purple and everyone thinks that it looks good.
I think that mismatched colors can look good, but sometimes people get a little carried away with the combinations.
I've noticed that a lot of the stars like to really follow the newest fashion trends.
I've noticed that too. They wear this stuff even if it does not look good on them.
Then again, sometimes the stars start the fashion trends.
Especially like the Kardashians. They seem to always be starting some new trend.
Yeah, like the trend with the clear boots.
Those things looked so uncomfortable. I dont understand why anyone would want to wear them.
I guess we can both agree that a lot of the new fashion trends are a little crazy and uncomfortable.
Yes they are, and still people love to wear these things.
