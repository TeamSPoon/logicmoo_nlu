Hi how are you?
Good, nice to meet you.
have you seen the new Twin Peaks?
Yes it's amazing!
David Lynch is out of his mind.
Totally. Do you think David Bowie filmed any scenes before he died?
I don't know, I read he might have.
But here's the big question: Dougie. Love or hate?
Hate, so cheesy.
I know, right!
It's a terrible way to treat Cooper/Dougie.
I thought he would snap out of it when he drank coffee.
Me too!
That would have been funny.
The glass box was cool.
very cool.
I can't wait for sunday.
the last two weeks feels longer than the 25 years since it was on.
exactly.
I'm glad it is good.
