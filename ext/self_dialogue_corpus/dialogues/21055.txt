Yeah!
Wow! I thought it was good, but not his best.
Whatever. Well, what is YOUR favorite movie?
Nothing beats Stepmom. I love my Susan Sarandon and Julia Roberts.
Really?! But that little boy was so weird and creepy.
I know. They should've casted another for that role.
And that teenage girl was a bit too dramatic.
True. She was also in that one movie with Macaulay Culkin as a super religious chic, right?
Oh yeah! Saved is what I think it is called.
Wow! We get on some weird tangents on movies, don't we?
As usual. That's why I like being able to talk about them with you.
Speaking of chic flicks, I say Bridget Jones's Baby and it was surprisingly really good!
Was it? I wasn't sure how good it was going to be, since I don't even recognize Renee's face anymore with all that plastic surgery.
Oh my God, yes! See it! I hadn't seen the other Bridget Jones's movies, but this one had me in tears from laughter!
So what is your favorite Tarantino movie?
From Dusk Til Dawn. It is such an original vampire comedy.
Wasn't George Clooney in that?
Yep!
Yes, it has been a while since I have seen that one, but I remember it being good!
I own it, if you ever want to borrow it?
