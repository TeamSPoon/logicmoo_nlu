I need a good horror movie to watch.
I would recommend watching "The Ring."
I've already seen that one. It was terrifying!
Yeah, it's probably the scariest movie I've ever seen.
To be honest, I never finished watching it because I had to leave the movie theater because it was so scary.
No way! That's actually pretty funny!
Do you have any other good horror movies to recommend?
I really like the "Blair Witch Project."
What's that about?
It's about a bunch of kids who go into the woods to film a school project on a witch.
That sounds scary. Was it as scary as The Ring?
No, it wasn't nearly that scary.
That's good.
Yeah, you should be able to handle it.
Awesome, thank you! I'll watch it tonight.
You should! It's a good movie.
Do you know how long it is?
I think roughly two hours.
Great. That's just what length I'm looking for.
Glad I could be of assistance
