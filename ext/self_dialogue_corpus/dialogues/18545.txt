Are the Red Hot Chili Peppers ever going to not be cool?
I think not. Those guys kill it years after years.
Their latest album is awesome. Have you heard it?
No I haven't. I have just heard random new songs here and there.
You should dedicate an hour and a half and listen to it completely
You know, I kind of lost my pasion for them since John Frusciante left.
Yes I also feel his absence. But the new guy is very good.
I'm sure he must be great if the rest of the band chose him as John's substitution. But it is not the same.
Well, that's right. This guy has his own style, but the passion John Frusciante put in is incomparable.
He could solo like nobody. He was a free soul with a guitar that could express tons of emotion.
Yeah. But the band still has their funk going.
Well, with Anthony, Flea and Chad still going strong I don't think the essence can be lost.
Absolutely. I mean they are kind of crazy to look at now a days, but they can inspire anyone.
How do you mean?
You look at these guys and they are all our age and still jumping around and banging their heads. It's crazy.
Well that's what a young spirit does. We should go to a concert like we did back in the days and test our own necks.
I would absolutely love that. Count me in.
Do you know when they will be near us?
I don't know but if we go on their website I'm sure we'll find out right away.
Cool. I'll check and let you know.
