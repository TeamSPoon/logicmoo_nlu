What do you think of punk?
You know I did not like it at first. I'm 62 and was into classic rock.
What changed your mind to like punk?
Well a guy at work turned me onto Social Distortion when I was like 51 years old?
And what did you like abut it? What changed you?
It was not acidy like I thought. The lyrics were great and a excellent upbeat rhythm.
Didn't sound like head banger music to you? It had to be different.
That's the point, it was quite different but very upbeat and loud like some rock.
What else about the Genre caught your eye?
Well, I spent a lot of my youth in Southern California. I later found out that they are from Orange County.
So that influenced whether you liked them or not?
Not really, it was just cool that I grew up from where they were raised.
What else about them did you like?
Well the lead guitarist was fantastic.
What else did it for you with Social D?
The drummers were awesome.
Are they still playing?
Im not totally sure. I guess I should check their website.
I'll bet they are still playing.
Probably, a lot of those old rockers either snorted their money away or lost out on rights through the internet.
