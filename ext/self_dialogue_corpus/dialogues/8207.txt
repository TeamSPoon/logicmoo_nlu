Have you heard all the new Ed Sheeran songs?
I don't think I've heard them all.
Be sure to listen to Castle on the Hill.
Is that one good?
Yes it is so emotionally powerful.
Wow I like how music can move me like that.
That's exactly what this song does, it is powerful.
He is so great.
Yes he writes amazing songs and sings them beautifully.
I agree, thank you for mentioning this, I am looking forward to listening to this song.
