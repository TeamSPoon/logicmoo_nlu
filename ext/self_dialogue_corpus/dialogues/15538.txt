I went to a Band of Horses conert the other night.
I've never heard of them.  What songs do they sing?
Their most popular ones are The Funeral and No One's Gonna Love You.
I don't think I've ever heard either of them.  What sort of music is it?
I would probably say it's alternative rock.  Very chill stuff.
Are they a new band?
No, they've been around since about 2005.  They've got 5 albums so far.
I'll have to check them out.  My favorite alternative rock band is The Smiths.
You know Band of Horses is kind of like them.  My favorite song by The Smiths is There Is A Light That Never Goes Out.
That is definitely their most popular.  I would say my favorite is How Soon is Now.
It's very sad that they broke up in the 80s.  I feel like they could have gone on to make more music together.
I heard they fought among themselves about royalties. Apparently Morrisey and Marr were taking most of the money and the other members weren't getting much.
That's a shame when good music gets broken up over squabbles with money.
I read an interview saying that Coldplay splits every song four ways so that they don't get into arguments about money.
That seems smart but even the ones that Chris Martin writes himself?
Yes, I guess they're in it all together.
Certainly works for them.  Coldplay has seven albums and I think they've been nominated for 62 awards.
Wow, I knew they'd been around a while but I had no idea they had that much.
I'm not a huge fan of Coldplay though as far as alternative rock goes.
I quite like them.  Yellow is definitely a good song.
