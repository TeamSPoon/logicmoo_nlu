What is your least favorite Disney movie?
My least favorite are any of the movies where a parent dies.
That is a lot of Disney movies. Bambi, Dumbo, Lion King, Frozen and I think a few others I'm forgetting.
Yeah, it seems to be a theme. Bambi made me really sad when I was a little child.
I understand. The Lion King used to make my little brother cry every time he watched it.
I bet most of the main characters from Disney are missing a parent.
It's a sad trend. My brother enjoys Disney movies and he cried a lot when he was a kid because of things like that.
Wreck-it Ralph and Zootopia are kind of sad too but in different ways.
Wreck-it Ralph is pretty upbeat.
Yeah, nothing too sad happens at least.
