Are you into rock music?
Not really. It is not my favorite.
But there are so many great rock bands.
Name a few of them.
Iron Maiden, Metallica, Judas Priest.
Those bands are too loud for me.
Too loud? You're crazy!
I'm not crazy. I just have different taste.
What do you like then?
I prefer pop.
Name a few artists you like.
Madonna, Cher, Michael Jackson.
I can't complain about those choices. Michael Jackson is the King of Pop.
He is. It is a shame he died.
I agree. Thankfully we still have his music.
His early work is unlike anything out there today.
Do you mean his music with the Jackson 5?
I prefer his solo records.
Me too. But the family band was pretty catchy.
I agree. They had some great songs!
