do you like bright eyes
i liked the album with lua
that album also had first day of my life
that is such a beautiful song
apparently its about how he would feel if he was in love
so he has never been in love?
i guess not
lua is probably more relevant to his life then
yeah, that loneliness and isolation
its a sad but wistful song
its definitely kinda sad
its a beautiful mellow tune
he was inspired by elliott smith too
elliott smith is the better songwriter though
but conor oberst has better lyrics
well, conor has more metaphorical lyrics
they are heavily masked behind metaphors
sometimes its hard to know what hes talking about
elliott was more simple
maybe thats better
