I just watched the best foreign film.
Really? I could never get in to those.
Wow, they open a whole new world of movies up.
Oh, like what movie.
It was called I am Love, crazy deep.
I really do not like to have to read the titles. I like movies about other places than America.
Like foreign films, only in English?
Yes, like I really got in to the Budapest Hotel.
That was a crazy cool show. Do you like his other movies?
Who, Wed Anderson? I think so I only knew a few.
The Royal Tenbaums is my favorite movie by him.
Is that the sort of silly family movie.
Yes, but really deep too.
With Ben Stiller and uh, the nose guy?
Yeah. It is super funny. Do you like Owen Wilson films.
I liked the one with Jackie Chan.
Shangai nights?Those were really funny!
That is the name. I liked him in a few of his other films too.
Like Zoolander?
The first one, not the second it was dumb.
