Did you hear that Disney bought the rights to Anastasia?
No, I did not. I thought that was already a Disney movie.
A lot of people, my self included, thought the same thing but apparently not.
Hey! Doesn't that mean she's officially a Disney Princess?
I suppose you're technically right. I mean, I don't see why not.
I wonder if they'll give her a live action movie like all these other classics getting remakes lately.
Well... actually... they announced the live action remake at the same time of purchase.
I wonder who they'll get to play the role of Anastia.
I wouldn't mind seeing Emma Stone to be perfectly honest.
I could see that or possibly Karen Gillan even if her contract would even allow her to. I don't think it'd be a problem her working on Guardians of the Galaxy and another Disney project.
