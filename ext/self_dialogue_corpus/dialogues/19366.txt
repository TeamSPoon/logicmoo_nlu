What decade had the worst music?
Are we talking of all time, or in our lifetimes?
Let's say in the past 100 years.
Good, because otherwise I'd probably say some decade during like 4000 BC!
Yeah, i bet the music wasn't too good then, haha. But in the past 100 years.
I'd have to go with the 70s.
Not a big Disco fan?
Disco was terrible! Some of the corniest music around.
What about Stayin' Alive? I Will Survive?
Those are some decent songs, I guess, but not among my favorites.
Or what about YMCA? That song is always fun at stadiums!
If you're basing your defense of an entire decade's music off a song being fun at stadiums, then I rest my case.
Fair enough, but there were some good bands making music in the 70s.
Name some!
Led Zepplin was active in the 70s. Pink Floyd, Aerosmith.
Aerosmith is not a good band, and Pink Floyd did a lot of their best stuff in the 60s.
Either way, there was some good music in the 70s.
You're right, but there's some good music done in every decade. Just a lot more bad stuff in the 70s.
I can see your point, but I have some fond memories of 70s music.
For sure, there are a few gems. But overall, bottom decade for music, in my opinion.
