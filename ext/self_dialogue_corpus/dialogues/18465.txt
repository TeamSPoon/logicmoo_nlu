This is a super random question but what is your favorite TV theme song?
That's a tough one but I would have to say the Full House theme song.
Ooh, I love that one! Which others do you like?
I really like the 7th Heaven theme song and the Brady Bunch theme song.
You really like the theme songs to a lot of family sitcoms, don't you?
I guess you could say I do!
I personally like the theme song to Full House, too.
It's a really good feel-good song, you know?
Yeah, it's a really good pick-me-up song.
That's exactly how I would describe it.
What is your favorite song in general?
"Iris" by the Goo Goo Dolls.
That is one of my favorite songs too!
I have played it so many times on my iPhone it's unreal.
I feel that! Do you like any of the Goo Goo Dolls other songs?
I'm not really familiar with too many of them, to be honest.
Yeah, they're a bit of a one-hit wonder.
I wouldn't say that. I know a few other of their songs, I just never realized they were the Goo Goo Dolls.
Oh, I'll have to go look them up.
You should. They're really not bad.
