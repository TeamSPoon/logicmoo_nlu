Was the movie "Tangled" about Rapunzel?
Well, yes and no.  It was a loose interpretation of it.
Right because her hair was special, and very long.
Just like Rapunzel.
And who played the voice of Rapunzel.
Mandy Moore.
Ah yes.  She did a good job.
Yes she sings in the movie too.
Oh really?  On the soundtrack?
Yes she sang "I See the Light".  It was nominated for an Oscar.
