Which version of Miracle on 34th Street do you like the best?
The original one of course. Natalie Wood is the best!
I agree.  I do like the made for TV remake with Teresa Wright and Thomas Mitchell.
I haven't seen that one.
They never show it on TV but I've seen it on DVD.
I don't like the modern one.
I don't either.  It's too gooey.
Yeah, and they don't do the thing with the letters at the end.
I also like Maureen O'Hara in the original but the man is forgettable.
You mean John Payne?
Yeah, that guy.  I like the TV version because MacDonald Carey plays the man.
I'll have to find that on Youtube.
Have you seen the one with Jane Alexander?
Oh, that one is awful.
I agree.  It's really boring.
Remakes in the seventies usually weren't that good.
I agree.
The only remake I really like is An Affair to Remember.  I like it better than the orginal Love Affair.
I do too.  The color adds something.
As does Cary Grant.
