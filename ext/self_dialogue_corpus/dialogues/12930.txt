How many Star Wars movies was Chewbacca in?
Five
Which ones?
The original 3 and then episodes 3 and 7.
I do not remember him in Episode 3
He was in it on the Wookie home planet.
Oh yeah. Now, I remember
He met Yoda.
That was sort of weird.
Yes. I prefer the Chewbacca from the first 3 original movies.
