What rap are you listening to right now?
I've been listening to a lot of eminem
Ahh he is a classic.
Marshall Mathers is a great album
I think 8 mile was a really good movie because of the music
His whole rise to stardom was such a good story.
His old songs are probably my favorite compared to his new stuff.
Yea, Lose Yourself is on my playlist for spotify.
I hope he continues to make new songs
I'm sure he will, its his calling.
