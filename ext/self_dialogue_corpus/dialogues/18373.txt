I have been trying to get into some new kind of music.
Like what kind?
Well, stuff that is not as big in America.
Indie stuff?
Not exactly, more like foreign music.
Like stuff in another language?
No, more stuff like Xavier Rudd.
Is that the guy that sings with a digeridoo?
Yes, but he does like pop and rock songs.
I caught a little of his stuff.
Like what songs?
I like his original, Come Let Go.
He does a cover of No Woman No Cry, it is beautiful.
If you like him, you might get into Paulo Nutini then.
Who is that?
The only song that really hit it big in the states was, New shoes.
Oh, what else does he do?
He has a really pretty one called Jenny Don't Be Hasty.
I will have to look this guy up.
Check out his new  stuff, it is breathtaking.
