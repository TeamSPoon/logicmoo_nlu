Your dog reminds me of someone.
Who?
JarJar Binks...an alien from one of thise Star Trek movies.
"Star Wars" movies. Not "Star Trek"!
There's a difference?
Of course there's a difference! Star Trek is a fictional, futuristic space fantasy about the crew of the starship enterprise, the crew's adventures in space, the wild and wacky alien enemies, and saving the galaxy!
Are saying that Star Wars is not a futuristic fictional space adventure, that there's no space ship, no crew, no enemies or wacky villians, and no thrilling fantasy space adventures?
Oh, it has all that too.
So what's the differnce?
Different part of space..I think...
