Is Cliff Lee a hall of famer?
Are you asking if he's in the hall of fame or if we think he should be based on his stats? He's not in the hall of fame.
Well yeah, I mean if he's retired and doesn't come back. Is he a hall of famer in your opinion?
DId he even officially retire? Last I heard he was rehabbing but that was a couple years ago now. I'm not sure.
I looked, he did retire last February.
3.52 career ERA doesn't scream hall of famer to me but man that doesn't even seem right.
That was the crux of my argument too. When you take into account his dominance that number didn't seem right.
He had a heck of five year run, but that probably isn't enough.
He has less than 150 wins too. Not looking great. I mean how can a guy that was so good seem so average in retrospect?
He did get a ring though, so he has that going for him.
That five year run was Koufax-esque in an era where players were supermen.
Yeah that's gotta count for something. But hof is usually compiled stats and you got 300 wins as a benchmark.
I'm looking at this article that has him in the neighborhood with Whitey Ford, Lefty Gomez, and Don Sutton.
Ford has all those championships though, Sutton got his 300 wins, Gomez played in the era before fire was invented lol tough to compare.
Baseball reference has similarity scores comparable to Jered Weaver and John Lester. Would you put either of those guys in the hall?
Weaver no, Lester maybe but again, the rings. Plus the guy had cancer, that's pretty impressive.
The more I read I gotta say no and just today I thought he was a pretty sure thing.
Yeah it really looks more like hall of very good for Lee. Still a solid career, just no hall of fame.
Tend to agree, but it's still just so surprising.
You wonder what could have been if he didn't get injured.
