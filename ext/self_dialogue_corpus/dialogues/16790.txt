Do you remember Duran Duran?
Remember? Why do I need to remember?
Well they are kind of an ancient group.They were hot in like the 80s, dude.
And so? That's a golden era. Duran Duran are in my "Girls Just Wanna Have FunTime Party Mix" at least twice. Maybe four times.
Okay okay, don't have a hernia about it. I didn't mean to disrespect your New Romantic boy toys.
Please. Gag me. But I do have that mix on every device I own. I hear Duran Duran like six times a week on average.
Whoa. Committed, you are.
Talk like Yoda, you do. What's up with that, supergeek? Anyway, what were you gonna say?
About Star Wars?
No idiot. Duran Duran.
Oh. I was just going through some old stuff my mom saved for me the other day.
Oh hell. Did you find the burn book? Literally. Burn it. I might want to be a Congresswoman like Maxine Waters some day...
No, fool. What does that have to do with D2? Jeez.
D2? Bwahahahahahahahahaha. MY New Romantic boyfriends, eh? Okay fiiiiine.
Whatever. Anyway I was digging through my old crap and I found this poster of them I used to have on my wall.
Okay and? Is it worth a thousand dollars or something?
No, it just made me feel kind of funny. All jokes aside we BOTH crushed hard on those dudes. But in this poster they were like. Rocking full makeup.
Oh hell yeah I remember that! Net half-shirts and bangles too! Their lips were glossier than ours, dude. So what? Were we like, gay back then?
No. No, I don't think so. I think we were lulled by the safety of ambiguous sexuality as our bodies slowly awakened to the possibility of carnal desire, yet we still knew that we were, to paraphrase Britney Spears, "not girls but not yet women."
Oh. Deep. Okay make sense to me. Let's get a slice of pizza dude. This pontificating has made me peckish.
