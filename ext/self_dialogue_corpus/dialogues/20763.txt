Have you seen Lady in the Van?
I have not heard of this movie.  Is it an older movie?
Not very old but I just saw it and thought that it was good.
Who was in the movie?
Maggie Smith played the main character and did an excellent job.
Wasn't she in Harry Potter?
She was in all the Harry Potter movies.
I really like all the Harry Potter movies but I think that the third one was my favorite.
The Prisoner of Azkaban was a really good movie.  Do you have a favorite character in Harry Potter?
That is a difficult question but I think that Ron is my favorite.  What about you?
My favorite would be Hermione because she is so smart.
She was just in Beauty and the Beast.  Have you seen it?
I went to the theater with my family to see that one.  I really enjoyed it.
I liked it also since it kept pretty true to the animated version.
The music really added to the film.
The music was very good and I was glad to here familiar songs.
Which did you like better, the animated or live-action version?
That is so difficult.  Probably the live-action but I don't really know why.
I agree and it is odd that I can't say why either.  I just liked it better.
Perhaps because I liked the actors in it which just added to the film.
