How did you like the 'Logan" thriller movie?
I really liked it, how about you.
The movie was filled with action, so that is always good.
Oh yea, action in a thriller movie is amazing.
I like how the action was throughout the entire movie, no dull moments.
It is rare to find movies with full action throughout.
I agree, that is what made this movie so good.
I was actually amazed because of the action.
The acting was good as well, you think so?
Yes, I had no arguments about the acting, it was good to me as well.
