Hey! Check this out. I found a new DJ I like.
Who is it?
Remember watching Samaurai Champloo on Adult Swim
Yeah, what about it.
Well, this guy named Nujabes made the beats for the intro song.
Really, sick song. You said the beats?
Yeah, it;s what he does. He's real good at it too. He has made a bunch of beats and has other artist sing the lyrics.
Oh, alright. Well, what else you got from him.
Listen to this song. Its called Lady Brown. Some guy named Cise Star sings the lyrics.
Insane, crazy rhythm and am loving the lyrics. It flows so smoothly.
Tell me about. One of my favs so far.
What album its this? I want to look it up on YouTube
Its called Metaphorical Music. Listen to the whole playlist that pops up if you do.
Am guessing you did already, huh.
For sure!! Guy made alot of music like this before he died.
No way!! He died.
Yeah, car accident or something.
What genre does his music fall under. Hip-hop, rap?
I keep hearing its trip hop, hip-hop, breakbeat,jazz rap. Man, a little bit of everything.
Well I like it. Definitely a fan now.
