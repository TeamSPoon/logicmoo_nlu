Have you heard of Justin Bieber's latest music collaborations?
Yes! He has alot this summer. I listened to them on Spotify.
I agree. He is doing pretty well.  Which one do you like?
I like his latest with DJ Khaled called, 'I'm the One.'
That's a really great song. I like his collaborations with Chainsmokers.
What song is that? I don't think I've heard it.
It's called 'Give Me Love.' It's fantastic.
I should definitely check it out.
What about Rihanna's new song with DJ Kahled?
What's the title of that song again? I forgot!
It's called, 'Wild Thoughts.' I like the beat and rhythm!
That's right, it's with Bryson Tiller.
It's a jam packed song with so much energy.
DJ Kahled is really doing well for himself.
I know! I wonder who he will be collaborating with next.
I guess we will find out soon enough.
I hope he does one with Beyonce!
Me too, that would be so awesome.
For now, I'll have to pick up his latest song on Spotify.
You definitely should!!
