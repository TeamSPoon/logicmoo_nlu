Do you like the Captain America movies?
I love them. Captain America Civil War is my favorite.
Mine too. The movies did get progressively better since part 1.
Right. The Winter Soldier is where Cap really broke out and showed his skills.
I loved the scene in the elevator when he fought off all those men.
Oh that was definitely my favorite part of Winter Soldier. I love Chris Evans.
Me too. He and Chris Hemsworth are so handsome.
They sure are. Captain America is so brave. The scene following the elevator where he wrecked the plane was awesome.
Classic scene. I loved how Bucky kept catching his shield, letting him know he was a match for him.
I love that too. Steve Rogers was really a dedicated friend, that's for sure.
