I think Lilo and Stitch was a severely underrated Disney movie.
I can't remember if I've seen that one--is it the one with the blue guy?
Yeah, he's an alien that lands in Hawaii.
I never saw that one; I guess it just wasn't marketed as much.
Oh, you should totally watch it, I cry every time.
You cry over a movie about a blue alien?
You probably cried about ET didn't you!
...Touche.
It's very sweet and it deals with some real issues--like, Lilo's parents are dead and it deals with adoption and family and stuff.
That is kinda deep. I'll have to check it out.
