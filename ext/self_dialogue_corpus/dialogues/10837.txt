Do you remember the first race in fast & furious?
The first ever race?
Yes that is the one i'm talking about.
Why do you ask?
I was just thinking about that scene and was curious if you remember if Brian's car was or broke down.
I believe it had some engine troubles during the race.
I remember he was trying to give Dom the best race he could.
Yep Brian tried so hard that one race.
That race set the stage for the rest of the movie and movies.
I agree I think if that scene sucked it wouldn't have been as big as it was.
