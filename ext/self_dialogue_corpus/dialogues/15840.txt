What was your least favorite band in the 90's?
That's a good question. I'm going to go with Weezer.
You really didn't like Weezer?
I know a lot of people love them. I just can't stand their vocalist's voice.
People swear by that band. I don't mind them, really.
Yeah their songs just seem boring to me. I can't stand "Beverly Hills"
That's definitely not their best hit single. I'll agree with that.
Okay your turn. What band was your least favorite in that era?
Mine is Sublime. I just don't like that type of music.
People are obsessed with that band, too. I don't care for them much either.
It just seems so cheesy to me. I think they're overrated.
Do you remember The Offspring?
Yeah. I actually liked The Offspring a lot.
Some of their songs were pretty funny.
I think their vocalist made the band. His voice was so angry.
You could definitely hear the emotion in it.
Whenever I think of them, I also think of Green Day.
Green Day is awesome.
They had some really good songs. The newer stuff is a bit more mainstream.
I agree. "Brain Stew" was the first song I ever learned on guitar.
