Have you seen the latest Pirates of the Carribean movie?
Not yet but my family and I are this weekend.
I think you will like it.
Oh, how so?
Jack Sparrow does a great job in this one.
He did a great job in all of them so far.
I agree, but this he gave his best performance yet.
Oh wow, I can't wait to see it.
I bet, it is #1 at the box office currently.
I hope they make more of these movies!
