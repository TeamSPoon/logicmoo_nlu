Do you like One Republic?
Um, yeah, some of their stuff, why?
I just wondered, I figured out the other day that I liked more of their songs than I realized.
Oh, yeah?  What made you realize that?
I was listening to some pop hits thing and a song of theirs came on, Counting Stars, and I liked it and then i thought about it and realized that I liked at least a few songs off each of their albums.
Isn't that like with every group you like?
No, not really, there are only a few groups or singers that I like the majority of their songs and a few more that I like some of the songs.  For most, I only like a couple of songs
Really?
Yeah.  Do you like all of the songs for every group or singer you like?
Not all, most for my favorites.  But for the ones I say I like, usually a few off each album.
Well, I like about three Rolling Stones songs enough to know the words and I can only ever think of two Metallica songs.
Three Rolling Stones songs, huh?  Maybe they're just not to your taste.
I do like pop a lot, but you know it's the same with Beyonce or Ed Sheeran and they have a lot of songs that are popular.
Wow, okay.  So who do you like enough to like most of their songs?
I don't know, the Beach Boys maybe.
The Beach Boys?  Okay, aren't the songs mostly about surfing?
They have a fair few songs about surfing and some about cars and some about other stuff.
You don't surf, though, do you?
No, but they are fun songs. You don't have to do something to enjoy a song about it.
I guess, but it helps.
