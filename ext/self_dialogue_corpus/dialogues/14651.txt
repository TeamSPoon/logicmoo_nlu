I think the NBA season should be cut to 50 games.
It would be more exciting.
And maybe cut the playoffs in half.
Thats alot of missed revenue.
Well some teams that make it have a record under 500.
Yeah but cutting the playoff teams in half doesnt fix that.
Sure it does, eliminate the first round.
Why not have everyone make it at that point?
Well that renders the regular season useless.
No, you would still need it for seeding purposes.
I dont think you need it for that, you need it to make money to pay salaries.
Well salaries would take a dip but why would the owners care about that
Their revenues would be cut in half.
OK so keep the playoffs the same but cut the regular season down?
Thats what I am saying.
I just dont see how they would lose that money and be OK with it.
The problem is you know the playoffs are set by February.
Not true, the bottom teams are always scraping.
I would like a playoff format where the best teams get byes. Its only fair.
This isnt football, that makes no sense.
