Hey, who's your favorite pop singer?
Mine is Madonna, who's yours?
Mine is Michael Jackson!!!
Oh man, he was the KING of POP! Can't deny that much.
He was a genius. Did you know he's the most awarded Artist of all time? He won more awards than any other musician alive or deceased.
Yeah I remember that day he left with his arms full of them. He also had the most expensive music videos in history.
Yeah his videos were the first multi-million dollar video clips and the most expensive ones in history too.
I head he also has the Guinnes record for Highest-Earning Deceased Artist. Quite sad but impressive.
Yeah he was the best, Thriller is going to be forever the best Halloween song. Heartbreaking...
I know but he left us an unforgettable catalog that can last us 100 lifetimes.
