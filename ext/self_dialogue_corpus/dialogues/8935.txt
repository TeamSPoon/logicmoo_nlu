Have you ever heard of Linkin Park?
Of course I have.
I have seen them live
They put on such a good show
In the End is still a great track even after almost 20 years.
They know how to write good music.
Do they still perform
They did a mashup with Jay Z
Did that give them new life?
No I think it just crossed genres for them
