What is your least favorite super hero movie?
Hancock.  That was a huge disappointment
Agreed.  They might have been trying to do a comedy but it sure didn't come off that way.
No, it was a box office bomb too I think.
Yes the critics certainly didn't care for it.
Nope, and I can say for once I agree with them.
Maybe if they had cast someone else.
I don't think it was Will Smith who ruined the film
No but he certainly didn't help it.
I guess we will have to agree to disagree on that one.
