Do you listen to rap?
Sometimes, I used to listen to it all the time.
Cool, I love rap. Who are your favorite rap artists?
That's tough. Eminem is definitely one of them
Of course. One of the best of our generation. Who else?
I used to love The Notorious B.I.G.
Nice choice. What about Jay Z?
Yea I like Jay Z. He's definitely one of my favorites.
Cool, and if you liked Biggy, then you must like Tupac right?
Yea Tupac was the man for sure.
Do you listen to Nas?
Yea I used to, but was never a big fan.
Oh, what about Lil Wayne?
No, I despise Lil Wayne. I consider him fake.
Oh, I love Lil Wayne. Do you think Kanye West is fake too?
Kind of. Just in a different way. I think he's a real artist, I just think he relies too much on being a personality to sell his records.
Yea, I can agree with that. Did you used to listen to NWO?
No, not really but I do love Ice Cube.
What about 50 cent? Do you think he's good?
Yea, 50 is pretty good.
