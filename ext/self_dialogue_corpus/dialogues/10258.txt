What is your favorite Die Hard movie?
That's some tough competition.  They are all good.
For me, I'll say the second one.
The one in the airport?
Yep.  A lot more was on the line since they could crash planes.
That's a fair argument.  The first will always be the best though.
That's true with most movies.
Best villain by far though with Hans.
No argument there.  That was a classic.
RIP Alan Rickman.
