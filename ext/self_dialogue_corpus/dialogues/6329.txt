What Disney movie would you say is the saddest?
The one that has made me cry the most is Fox and the Hound
Really? Isn't that just a cute animal movie
Well yeah, but there are some really sad scenes in it
Like what?
When the main woman character has to drop off Todd the fox in the forest, I always tear up
Yeah but I can think of a sadder movie, like Dumbo or Bambi
I can understand Bambi being sad...but Dumbo?
That scene where the mother elephant  gets separated from her baby always gets me
I'v heard that a lot of mothers find that scene touching as well
