Did you see The Hangover? It was one of my all-time favorite movies!
Yes, I loved that movie so much! My favorite character was Zach Galifianakis.
Me too. He made the movie so much better how he always acts so innocent and unaware.
Remember that part when he put drugs in their drinks and didn't tell them?
How could I forget! That's how all the action started! What about the part when they go to Mike Tyson's house?
And they stole his tiger! That was classic comedy.
Bradley Cooper played a great lead character in this movie.
Did you see him in The Hangover Part 2?
Of course. It was just as funny as the first one.
I liked when Ed Helms got the tattoos on his face that Mike Tyson has!
