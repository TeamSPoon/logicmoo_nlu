Why do you think the music for Jaws is so scary?
I don't really think it's too bad, but I have a theory.
Such as?
Well, it's a combination of a few things.
Like what?
It starts out very low with the tubas and basses. I don't know other scores that use that.
Yeah, they typically start high for the scares.
It's also highly repetitive and sounds like the tempo is increasing even though it's not.
How can it sound like that?
Well, the tempo stays consistent. It's just the amount they play gets shorter each time, and the window between soundings gets shorter too.
Oh, right.
It also occurs while the camera "swims" underwater, giving you that weird sensation.
Claustrophobia?
Yeah, for some people.
That makes sense.
Thanks!
I thought you'd say it was the tuba solo.
Just because I play tuba doesn't mean I'm going to bring it up all the time.
The tuba part is super effective though, right?
Yup! I think it's because it's a super low instrument but the part is quite high for the instrument. They put us underwater and give us timbres we're not used to.
