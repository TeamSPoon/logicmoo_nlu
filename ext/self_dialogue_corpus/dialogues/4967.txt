What's the funniest thing you've ever seen at a baseball game?
I absolutely lose it when people go out of their way to get a foul ball or a home run, and suffer the consequences.
Yeah, when a ball lands in their awful beer or their food and it explodes, I laugh my butt off.
One thing I love to see never happens during the game, but something we learn about after the fact.
What's that?
When they have the kiss cam on, and one person in a couple is caught cheating on their partner.
That's sick.
Why?
You're enjoying people's personal affairs being ruined.
They deserved it. They went into public and cheated in an area where their faces are broadcast.
Anyway, have you ever caught a home run?
Yes, sort of.
Sort of? How do you not know? Did you confuse it with ... how do you not get it?
It was during batting practice at the Reds game. I went down during the last batter, and he hit it right at me.
You caught it?
Yeah, and I reached over a little kid to get it, caught it in my hand with no glove, to impress my girlfriend.
You took a ball from a kid?
No, I caught the ball instead of the kid catching it.
Taking a home run from a child is pretty much the worst thing anyone can do at a baseball stadium
No, not really. This kid will have another 80 years to catch a foul ball or home run. I have limited time. I don't care about that kid.
