I really enjoyed Rogue One.
I didn't care for it that much actually.
Why didn't you like it?
The whole thing seemed like an exercise in futility, as it is clear from the beginning that no one is going to live.
I didn't really expect that actually, and the fact that everyone dies made the movie very affecting to me.
If you didn't see it coming I could see that. The battle sequences themselves were pretty great.
They were very thrilling. This was a really solid sci-fi war movie.
I found the characters to be a little thinly developed though.
I liked them quite a bit, and was pretty depressed as they were killed off one by one.
We are going to have to agree to disagree on that part.
