Well I guess the Astros are for real. They now have the best record in baseball.
They have been impressive the past two nights beating the Yankees.
They won't get a chance for a third straight win until tomorrow.
Why's that?
Game just got rained out I saw. Yankees are probably relieved.
Who's been the Astros best hitter this year? Don't hear much about them.
I guess Altuve, they've been pretty balanced.
Are they going to play a doubleheader tomorrow?
I doubt it, will probably make it up later in the year.
Yeah, doubleheaders usually seem to be later in the summer.
Plus tomorrow is Jeter night on ESPN and they wouldn't want to have the first game run late.
That's true, I forgot about that.
The Cardinals are suddenly in first place now. How did that happen?
Are they? Jeez, didn't they start like 4-10.
Something like that, although they did lose last night to the Cubs.
That whole division is close, I think the Cubs are near the bottom.
Yeah, for now, I don't see it lasting though.
Yeah, no way the Cubs are going to finish below the Reds.
Well at this rate...they don't seem to have their heads in the game.
Still 100+ games to go though.
