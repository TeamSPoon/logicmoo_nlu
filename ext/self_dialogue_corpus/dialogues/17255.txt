I've been listening to some different music lately.  I've been really stuck on Kelly Clarkson.
Didn't she win American Idol?
She did, she was the first winner.
I like her music but don't listen to it often.
You should give some of her newer stuff a try.
I will check some of her stuff out.
Her songs have a good message for someone who is fairly young.
She always seems really down to earth in her interviews.
I agree she seems very normal.
I love her song Ms. Independent.
Me too, it sends a great message to young women.
It does, it shows them that they can be successful on their own.
A lot of her music seems to be about trouble in her family while growing up.
I know if you listen to the words some of them are very telling.
I'm going to try and get tickets to see her show at Gillette this year.
That would be amazing.
I just saw U2 there..
How was it?
It was great but I hate that traffic coming home.
A show like that makes it worth it!!!
