Some say the best Star Wars movie is The Empire Strikes Back - your thoughts?
Well, from a storyline and script perspective, but in terms of movie-making and cultural significance, it has to be episode IV, A New Hope (i.e., the original).
Yeah, but in terms of movie itself, don't you have to say that Empire Strikes Back...
Let me interrupt you right there. No, Stars Wars -- the first one -- revolutionized the movie industry. Summer blockbusters, product tie-ins, catering to a youth market. We are still living in the consequences of this.
Yes, I see what you are saying, but just in terms of a movie itself, much of the story and dialogue of the original is so corny, hackneyed, and B-rate.
True, and if memory serves me correctly, Lawrence Kasdan wrote the second screenplay and it was more nuanced, believable, adult, and mature.
Are you still holding onto your opinion that the original Star Wars is the "best"?
Yes, it's not really even a debate when factoring in cultural impact and significance, which you have to.
Jaws had a similar cultural impact, but would you say Jaws is a better movie then say, Citizen Kane or The Seventh Seal?
No, but you're creating a straw man argument there. Star Wars is almost like a religion, and it's impact has to be taken into account when evaluating all of the movies in the franchise.
