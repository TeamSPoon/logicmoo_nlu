Have you been to any concerts lately?
Yes! I went to see Otep the other day.
I don't think I know who that is. Would I know them?
Probably not, they're pretty heavy. How about you? Any concerts lately?
I went to see Seether a couple weeks ago, I love them!
Ooo, they are good. Shaun Morgan is a great songwriter.
Yes, he is. Have you listened to the new album?
I think I've heard a song or two. What's your favorite on it?
I love the song Saviours, it's about people who are desperate for attention on social media.
That's great! I saw the cover they did of that Thrice song, Black Honey, it sounded great!
