I know this is an old movie, but have you seen Sixth Sense?
Oh my gosh, yes.  That is one of my all-time favorites.
"I see dead people" is still one of the scariest movie lines ever.
That's for sure.
Were you surprised at the end?
Yes.  I had no idea that the Bruce Willis character was dead.
I figured it out at the beginning.
How did you know?
My niece pointed out that he had the same shirt on he was wearing when he was shot.  That's when I knew.
Really?  I never even noticed.
