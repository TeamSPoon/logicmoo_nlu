What do you think of Fleetwood Mac?
They are great, I love them.
They have been around since the seventies and still are hot today!
You are right. Stevie Nicks has a great voice.
She does. Have you heard the song the Dealer?
My favorite is Rhiannon. She really hits some notes with that one.
Lindsey Buckingham has a voice to die for.
He sure does and he still sounds great today. One of my favorites that he sings is Go Your Own Way.
That song is great. They have so many. One of my favorite albums in Rumors. I listened to that over and over in high school.
I still listen to it today!
I saw them last year in Philadelphia. What a show!
What songs did they do?
Wow, a lot, a really long concert with three encores.
Did they play Rhiannon?
Yes, Rhiannon, Gypsy, Landslide, The Chain, Go your own Way, and a lot more of the classics as well as some new songs.
Was Christie McVie with them?
Yes, she has an awesome voice!
She does, and Mick Fleetwood is an awesome drummer.
I hope they come around again soon.
Me too, maybe we can go together, that would be fun.
