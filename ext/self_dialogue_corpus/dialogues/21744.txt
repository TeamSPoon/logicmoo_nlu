Have you seen Batman vs Superman?
Yeah, I didn't really care for it much.
I know, it was poorly written.
There were highlights though.  Ben Afflick proved me wrong.
I know he was great.  How about Gal Gadot as Wonder Women?
She was awesome.  That movie was really good too.
Yeah, it's been the only good one in the DC movie universe.
I know, and Jesse Eisenburg was terrible as Lex.
I know, I wish he would have bee a little more robust.  Like the cartoon Lex.
Yeah, he was one of the best.
It was cool to have Doomsday in the movie though.
Yeah, Doomsday is always under represented outside of pure comics.
A lot of people had never heard of him.
Do you think Justice League will be good?
I hope so.  Maybe it can learn from the mistakes of Batman vs Superman.
Like actually try and make sense.
I didn't care for most of it either.  What was with those flash backs?
I don't know.  Not the best written movie.
But hey, at least we have a DC universe building.
Let's just hope it catches up to MCU
