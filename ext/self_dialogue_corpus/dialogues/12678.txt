Did you know people misquote the like from Empire Strikes Back all the time?
Which one is that?
No, I am your father.
How do they say it wrong?
They say, Luke I am your father.
That is weird.
Yeah. A lot of people think that is the quote.
I'm not surprised. It sounds more natural.
Yes. it's just a fun fact.
There are probably way more quotes that people get wrong.
