Lets talk about movies
Great i love movies
So do i
Did you see constatine
That was a good movie
I really liked it
It was so wierd too
Yes it was
It gave such a wierd perspective on angels and demons
And hell
And how he got to hell
It was so wierd
I dont know why they didnt make another one
Me either
It would have been interesting
I would have watched it
Me too
Its sad they didnt
I agree
Nice talking to you
