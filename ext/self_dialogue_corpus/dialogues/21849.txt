2017 is looking like a good year for the movies
oyeah that's so true so many big movies out and most of them making it to top 5 in the box office.
which are your best so far  this year?
quite a handful lol "wonder woman" "star trek:the last jedi" "justice league" and "allien covenant" how about you?
i have seen all you've mentioned and "wonder woman" is sure on my list as well then "spider-man: homecoming" "get out" and "ghost in the shell".
oh damn you've seen "ghost in the shell' the preview was something else, i was already dying to see it,oh now yo saw it before me lol.
man the movie was great just what you'd expect from a "Rupert Sanders" directed movie.
oh rupert directed that movie i thought i saw Jamie Moss, William Wheeler, and Ehren Kruger as co directors.
no mate probably you saw the names of the writers as it was co written by those three you mentioned.
oh i see, Rupert is a great director so i am no longer surprise why the movie was an instant box office hit.
too much suspense and intrigue filled in the movie and the Japanese Motoko Kusanagi played his role to perfection.
oh that guy i swear i have seen him on another movie before but just can't pick the movie.
that should be "Rangers"
great he is the 7th ranger with the sun power right?
yes that is Motoko Kusanagi.
i said it, i knew i have seen him on another big movie before.
"Rangers" was his first successful movie and "ghost in the shell" is a follow up, but would be his biggest thus far going by the acceptance.
"Rangers" was kinda criticize for its too much focus on a particular ethnic group hence its poor reviews.
yeah "Rangers" would have been even bigger than what it achieved if not for that and the reviews were so poor from first time critics, but by and large i enjoyed watching it.
i did enjoyed watching it as well,
