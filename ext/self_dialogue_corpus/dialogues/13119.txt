What do you think about all of the changes that George Lucas made to the original Star Wars trilogy?
I don't mind the small special effects improvements but the major changes and ones that actually alter the story, I really dislike.
What change do you dislike the most?
Probably that music number from Return of the Jedi called Jedi Rocks. It changes the whole tone of the scene and it extremely annoying.
Most people would say that the Han shot first change is the worst.
That's pretty bad but it's so quick that you can ignore it. You can't ignore the Jedi Rocks song.
What change did you like the most of them all?
Like I said, the minor special effects changes are nice actually. They just make the movies look a little nicer and more modern without dramatically changing the movie.
What did you think about the CGI Jabba the Hutt that was added in the Star Wars Special addition?
I think it looks very fake and out of place. It's kind of a cool scene that maybe they could have added as a DVD extra but to have it as part of the movie forever is a bad thing I think.
