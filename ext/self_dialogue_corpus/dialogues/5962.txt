National Treasure was a good series for Disney
Yeah I thought Cage played a great character in it.
Yeah he was a code breaker in the film.
I forget what his name was
It was Ben Gates
Thats it! He was the ultimate thief if you will
Yeah he was looking for treasure in the movie
Isnt that why its called that
Yeah it was as old as the United States
Yes thats what the film centered around
