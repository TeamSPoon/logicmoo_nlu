Have you ever seen Pinocchio?
Yea of course, its a classic.
It had a nice blend of comedy and moral lessons
Yea, it would suck if my nose grew every time I lied
It would be an pretty annoying trying to walk
I really liked jiminey cricket
Yea he was voiced by Dickie Jones
His little umbrella was awesome
I love Disney movies
They are my favorite animated movies
