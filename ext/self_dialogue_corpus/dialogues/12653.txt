Know anything about the new Han Solo movie?
No.
The directors, just got fired and replaced by Ron Howard.
Ron Howard? It's been years since he had a hit.
Yeah, but I think he'll be good.
What makes you say that?
The guy has won an academy award for directing. You dont forget how to direct because of a few flops.
We'll see.
Give the man a chance. He hasn't even started yet and you're skeptical.
I'm not skeptical,, I just dont like wasting my money. I'll probably see it.
