They need to do Sword in the Stone as a live action.
I doubt they'll do it.
Why do you say that.
King Arthur just came out.

One type of movie is released, then a dozen more just like it crop up.
True. They might do it.
Seems like they're doing everything else.
That would be a good one to bring back.
