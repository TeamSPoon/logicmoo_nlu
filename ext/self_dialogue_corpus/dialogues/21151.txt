Lisa I just saw a trailer for a new shark movie.
Shark movie? I didn't know they were making another shark attack movie.
Seems like they have one every summer.
That's for sure. What's the name of this one?
47 Meters Down.
47 Metes Down?  What's that about?
Two sisters Kate and Lisa and go  to Mexico for a vacation filled with sun, fun and adventure.
Let me guess. They get themselves in the water and attacked by some sharks.
Something like that but not quite.
You know, all these shark movies do is make people fear sharks. It's not like sharks walk on the land and attack us.
Yeah. They are always made to be the villains in the movie but they be in their natural habit when they attack people.
So what does that tell you?  Stay out of the water and you won't be attacked.
In the movie, the one sister suggests that they go diving in shark-infested waters.
I would have said no right there.
This is a movie it wouldn't be fun it they had some common sense.
Yeah well common sense saves lives.
You're too much. Anyway they think they will be safe in a protective cage to go swimming with a group of great whites
You said "think." What goes wrong?
Their cage breaks away from their boat, sending them plummeting to the ocean floor with a dwindling supply of oxygen.
See, if they had kept their behinds on land, that would not happen. I think I will go see that movie just so that I can yell at them for being so stupid.
