lady gaga music is so mellow
yes it is she is a good artist
she works so hard and has good music all the time
i lover her songs there very heart felt
she can also  blow her lungs out
her music reminds me of ole school pop
what one song you could'nt do without from her?
i think that would be the song she sung in the superbowl
yes that song was a hit from her
yes it was and she has lots of great songs
