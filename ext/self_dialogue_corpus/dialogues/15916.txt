Do you like Mariah Carey?
Not really. She does have a good voice though.
Why don't you like her?
I meant I don't like her music.
She makes great music! Mariah Carey is iconic.
I disagree. I would say Madonna or Michael Jackson are iconic.
Well, they might be iconic but they cannot sing as good as Mariah.
I will agree with you on that. Does Mariah Carey even still make music?
I am not sure. I think she does.
Well, the last thing I remember about her was that disastrous performance that she did on New Year's Eve.
I know what you're talking about. That was horrible to watch.
It seemed like she forgot the words to her own song.
Possibly. However, she is still one of my favorite artists.
I know! You talk about her all the time.
I do not. Well, maybe I talk about her a little bit.
Anyway, how do you feel about Taylor Swift?
She is too generic or me but I know you're a fan.
I am her biggest fan! I am going to see her in concert next week.
Really? With who?
My sister. It is going to be a surprise.
