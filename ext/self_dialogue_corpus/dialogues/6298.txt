Did you know the best Johnny Depp movie is a Disney movie?
Someone can't "know" that, it's an opinion.
Sure, but it's a very strongly supported opinion.
Okay, point taken. I have to admit though, I don't know any Disney movies with Johnny Depp.
Pirates of the Caribbean!
That's so true! The set and costume design for that movie are insane.
So good, right? It's so gritty and real feeling.
Yeah, it's probably the only Disney movie that has ever truly scared me.
Disney movies tend to be a bit more lighthearted.
Yeah, it's a testament to Disney's production that they could produce such a film.
