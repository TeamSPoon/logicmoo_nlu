What is your favorite type of music?
I like very old music.
Like classics?
Yes. Frank Sinatra in particular.
Oh cool, yeah I own some of his albums.
Amazing! I also like Etta James.
You do? I have her entire collection.
Oh yeah I saw that on sale somewhere.
You just don't find people who sing like that anymore.
I agree, it is a shame.
But you find plenty of people like Adele for example who sing that good.
Yes that is true.
Do you have any Adele albums?
Yes I do. I liked her before she got super famous.
Very few people can do here range.
I agree.
Do you like Mariah Carey?
I have none of her albums.
That is a shame. She is so talented.
That is true. Well it was great talking to you.
