Hey, man? One more month with no football!
I know. I'm so happy it's almost back.
Who do you think is gonna win it all this year?
Oh, man. You know I'm going with the Falcons again.
Man! Last year was a fluke.
We shall see. We shall see.
I think the Cowboys are gonna make a run for it.
I can see that. Dak is sick!
No doubt. And Elliot.
And Dez!
Their offense is stacked, for sure.
Their defense, however... They're gonna need to step it up.
Yeah, especially when it comes to the playoffs.
Yeah, if they weren't playing at such a deficit against the Packers, they could have won.
True, true.
But, of course, the Falcons handled them!
And then got trolled in the Super Bowl!
Don't remind me!
28-3, man... Never forget!
Okay, I suddenly have to go! See you for the season opener!
