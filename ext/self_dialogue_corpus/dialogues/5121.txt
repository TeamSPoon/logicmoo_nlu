Was looking forward to watching the Beltway series today but it got rained out.
Same. You a Nats fan?
Nah, O's all day.
Ah. I'm a Nats fan but I go to a lot of Orioles games too.
Good baseball is good baseball.
Especially during the playoffs. I went to an O's Tigers playoff a couple years ago. Place was on fire.
2014?
I think so.
We swept them right?
Yeah, then got the same treatment from the Royals.
Ugh. Don't remind me.
LOL not exactly rings over here in DC either.
You got Harper though. It's only a matter of time.
It takes more than one guy though. You got Machado.
Fair enough.
Did they reschedule the rainout?
I dunno, haven't checked.
The rain didn't even seem that bad in the first place.
My brother said the same thing. I guess the field was probably just beyond play.
Probably easier to beat up on the Phillies tomorrow for the Nats.
