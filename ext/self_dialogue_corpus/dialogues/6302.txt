What's your favorite Disney movie?
Like, of all time? That's too hard. You'd have to divide it into, like, pre-Pixar and post-Pixar.
Okay. What's your favorite pre-Pixar movie?
Sleeping Beauty. Hands down. That movie is absolutely beautiful. And the characters are great.
Is that the one with the dwarfs?
Uh, no, you're thinking of "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs." The one with Dwarfs in the title. Sleeping Beauty has the witches.
Oh yeah, the three little witches. The pink one, blue one, and green one.
Flora, Fauna, and Merryweather. Plus Maleficent.
She's the bad guy?
Wait, have you not seen this movie? Oh my god. Sit down, we are watching this movie RIGHT NOW.
