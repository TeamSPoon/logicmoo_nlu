So I saw Cars 3 today?
And?
I can't figure out why they keep making these things.
Boys seem to like them more.
Yeah, but they just don't have the magic of the other Pixar films
That's true, but at least it was better than Cars 2.
Yeah, that was horrible.  Probably worst Pixar movie ever.
With the exception of Up.
Up?  You're crazy!
Nope, just opinionated!
