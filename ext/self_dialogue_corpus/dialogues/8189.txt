Do you remember that one song from way back, I think it was "Barbie Girl"?
Yes! My friends and I would dance to that song all the time.
Who sang it? Do you remember?
Yes it was a band named Aqua.
Oh okay that does sound familiar.
I just feel like the music back in the 90's was the best.
I completely agree. Some were one hit wonders though.
You mean like Vanilla Ice?
Oh yes him of course! I loved his one song though.
Yes! "Ice Ice Baby!"
