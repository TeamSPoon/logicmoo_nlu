You've seen Star Wars right?
Yes, of course.
Who is your favorite villain.
Tough one, but Boba Fett.
Why is that?
Well he is so mysterious and he has some awesome gadgets, he's like the outer space Batman.
That's a good point.
Plus he doesn't say much he's all action which I like.
I never really though of Boba Fett as a villain more of just muscle.
Well yes but he always is on the bad side.
