What do you think of folk music?
Like traditional music of the land?
No like folk from the 60s.
oh like bob dylan?
Yes among many others. I take it not your first choice of genre.
Probably not but I enjoy some.
Like who do you enjoy most? in folk...
Bob dylan, blowin' in the wind is great.
It is very poetic and moving.
I find it so deep and thought provoking.
He was a lyrical genius.
I agree. Who do you like?
Simon and Garfunkel are one of my favorites.
I enjoy them. which is your favorite from them?
I think sound of silence.
That is probably the most famous too.
I think it spread widely because of it's beauty and message.
I do think folk had that going for it, a message in the music.
Agreed, a message with meaning and importance.
Not the same today in music, sadly.
