Do you ever watch anime movies?
I have seen a few.
Did you watch Kimi no Na wa?
No, whats that mean?
It means Your Name, in English.
Oh, so whats it about?
Its about a country girl in Japan who wants to live in Tokyo. She wakes up one day in a Tokyo boys body.
So he switched with her as well?
Yeah. They try to figure out whats going on and eventually fall for each other.
Sounds pretty good.
Its been the number one rated anime on Myanimelist.com for a year. That includes movies and shows.
Wow, I might check it out.
The music is amazing, its full of foreshadowing which makes it fun, the characters are great.
Is there an English dub?
No, you have to watch it in subtitles.
That's ok I guess.
Yeah, you should watch it. It deserves the score it has.
I'll give it a shot.
Good, I hope you like it.
Thanks.
