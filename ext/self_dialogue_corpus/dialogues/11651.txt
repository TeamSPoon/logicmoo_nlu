I was watching peoples' YouTube videos about their Top 5 Beatles albums, and guess which great one was not on one single list?
I know, because I've done it, too -- Magical Myster Tour.
It totally blows my mind.
Me, too.  It's like, it's got I am the Walrus, Magical Mystery Tour, Your Mother Should Know, Strawberry Fields, Penny Lane, Your MOther Should Know, All You Need is Love. I mean, it's crazy!
I know -- people don't think of it as a Beatles release, maybe, but more of a soundtrack.
Well, it's not. At the time it was THE Beatles release that year. You weren't getting nothing else for at least a year. That WAS the release!
And, holy cow, what a release. It's like a greatest hits unto itself.
I agree. I think the movie kind of overtakes it in peoples' minds.
People need to just step back and listen to it as an album.
I totally agree.
