have you seen Central Intelligence?
oh my goodness , that movie was hilarious
I really liked how the situations progressively escalated between kevin hart's and dwayne johnson's characters
totally. that initial scene after calvin wakes up after his first night reuniting with Bob really got the movie moving
I saw central intelligence for the first time while taking an airplane trip
how did you contain yourself
I couldn't, people all around me thought I was nuts because i kept bursting into laughter
it was very predictable though, but I still thought it was pretty funny too
bob jones (dwayne johnson) in the fat suit singing in the shower was ridiculous
yes! and Kevin Hart character being the cool kid in high school was a funny touch.
