So who's your favorite Harry Potter character?
Severus Snape.
What?! He was a nasty character who bullied Harry and his friends for years!
Yes, but he was also trying to protect them even though the experience was extremely painful for him.
Okay, I know it wasn't easy, but did he have to be so mean?
Harry was a living, breathing reminder of everything he'd lost. You can't blame him for having negative feelings toward him.
Yeah, maybe that's true.
Besides, he couldn't have been nice to Harry, even if he'd wanted to.
Why do you say that?
Because hating Harry, or at least pretending to, was a crucial part of maintaining his cover with Voldemort.
