Hey do you watch any baseball?
Yeah why?
Well did you see the Tigers crush the yankees last night?
Yeah I did see that! Verlander had like 15 strikeouts right?
He actually has 18 strikeouts.
Wow, he's so good.
Do you think they are gonna make the playoffs this year?
I hope, it just depends on if they play consistently.
Thats true, it would be great to see them make a run for American League title.
Or even the World Series!
That would be amazing. Tigers haven't been in a few years.
I remember that, I almost bought a ticket to one of the games.
That would have been amazing to see them win it.
It might happen we've got enough good players.
You're right. With cabrera at the plate anything is possible.
I have not seen a player like him before.
He's able to hit the ball so naturally.
I know, I can't even hit a baseball.
Haha. We should go to a game sometime.
Sounds good to me!
