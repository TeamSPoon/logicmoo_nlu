Did you see the Pirates of the Caribbean The Black Pearl?
Was that the 1st one?
Yes I think so, When they find Will Turner as a boy?
Yes that was probably the best one.
I loved that movie with Johnny Depp.
Did you see the new one that just came out?
No not yet, but I want too.
Me too. I don't know how good it's going to be though.
It's going to be good, just because Jack Sparrow is the main pirate.
Yes that's who I like to see the most.
