It's crazy to think about the fact that Star Wars has been in theaters for pretty much every generation alive now.
Wow, I'd never thought of it that way. They really do have a long run.
And now they've got three whole trilogies underway, that's crazy!
Which trilogy is your favourite?
I mean, I can't really put the most recent one into account since they've only had one episode so far.
That's true, it's hard to compare one out of three to a full set.
I think the most recent trilogy could go somewhere, but for now the original trilogy is my favourite.
No surprise there, honestly. No one likes the prequel trilogy.
Honestly the idea behind the prequel trilogies is great, it's just that the dialogue is so poor.
Plus Anakin's so whiny. I never knew someone complaining about sand could be so annoying.
