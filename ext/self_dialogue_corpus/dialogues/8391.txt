You know who is a great singer?
Who? Maybe I like them too?
It's Shawn Menendes. I love his song "Treat You Better."
Yes that is such a sweet song.
He's actually really young.
Oh wow really? I had no idea.
I know. He's great though.
You know his song "Mercy"?
Yes I do! Also a great one. I listen to it often.
I do also. It has great lyrics.
