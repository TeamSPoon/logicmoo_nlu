You ever been to the jungle?
Naw, what do you mean?
The Amazon, never been to the rainforest?
No, why?
I'm still having these sounds come to my mind since last month..
Really? From the jungle?
Yes, these animal sounds, these bird calls, these crickets and frogs at night.
It's stuck in your head?
Yes! All in minor notes. Nature's sounds are all in minor notes, like a symphony, like God's song in A minor.
Ha ha, you're nuts. So what made you come up with this?
Minor notes are just a slight key off in a pentatonic scale.
You mean like the Blues and Jazz?
You ever notice? You remember the Jungle Book by Disney? King Louie? "Well I'm the King of the Swingers oh.."
"The Jungle VIP.." Yep, is that with minors?
Absolutely, the whole thing is. Also, watch "The Emerald Forest" by John Boorman from the 80's, great minors in the soundtrack.
So where do you think minor notes came from, nature?
I bet so. Maybe it originally came from African work songs which in turn came from the minor note buzzing of the Congo.
Wow, that's deep. The forest in a minor scale.
Yeah, God's choice for his music scale all blend for nature's harmony.
Wow, you're absolutely crazy.
