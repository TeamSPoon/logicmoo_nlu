Who is your favorite character?
Darth Vader?
Why is that?
Because he represents the ultimate character - from good to evil and back to good!
Is that really why or is it because he chokes people with the force?
Not going to lie, thats pretty cool too!
I would think that is what makes him cooler than everyone.
Well, he was voiced by James Earl Jones so thats another positive.
True, he did sound pretty awesome.
See what I mean - best character ever!
