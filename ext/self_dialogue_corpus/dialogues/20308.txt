Have you seen that Matt Damon movie where his character is not who he appears to be?
You mean The Bourne Identity?
No, the other one.
The Bourne Ultimatum?
No, the other one.
The Bourne Supremacy?
No, the other one.
Jason Bourne?
No, the other one.
Do you mean The Departed?
No, that's not it either.
I'm running out of ideas.
It's The Informant!
You seem pretty excited about that.
No, the title ends in an exclamation point.
Really?
Yes, really.
I didn't see that one.
You missed nothing.
You're an idiot.
