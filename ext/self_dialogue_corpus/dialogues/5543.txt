Have you seen the new Beauty and the Beast movie?
No! I've been wanting to see it!
It was really good!
Yeah, my boyfriend said he would take me but he never did.
Well you should rent it and watch it at home now.
Maybe I will. I hear good things.
Yeah the singing was really good.
I love singing Disney movies.
Me too, the main song was stuck in my head for a week.
Ok, I am going to watch it tonight.
