I hear melodies in my head, melodies in my head!
Ha, you must love that song!
I'm a big Madison Beer fan over here!
Madison Beer is a good singer.
I believe she is talking about Justin Bieber in that song, right?
Are you sure she's not talking about her boyfriend?
Well, in the music video, Madison is wearing JB Beats by Dre, and JB is in the entire video, and at the end, Madison meets him.
Oh, I see. Then she probably is talking about Justin in the song.
Yeah, and it's super adorable!
Sure sounds adorable, I may have to go check it out on YouTube!
