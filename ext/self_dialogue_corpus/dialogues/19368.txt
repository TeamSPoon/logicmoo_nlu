I was thinking back to my college days today and my early 20's. Music was something that came to mind. What kinds of music makes you think back on those times?
Mostly alternative and rock bands.
Yeah, same with me. I remember bands like Godsmack, Rob Zombie, and Sevendust.
Godsmack. Yes. Definitely brings back the memories.
What kinds of alternative bands or songs bring back memories for you?
Foo Fighters, Evanescence, Our Lady Peace, Green Day. I could go on and on.
Evanescence. Wow. They were great. Too bad they didn't stick around too long. That lead singer, was great. What was her name? Amy something.
Amy Lee.
Yes, Amy Lee. Wow, she had emotion and a powerful voice.
I hate to admit it, but I sometimes I get teary eyed when I hear the song My Immortal.
I'll admit the same thing.
That song was so powerful and brings me back to more happy times, even though the song is sad.
Funny how that works sometimes, where sad songs make you think of happier times.
Yes, the song itself made me sad, but associating it with other things in my life at the time, it brings back happier times.
What other sad songs bring back happier memories for you?
Green Day, Time of Your Life.
What does that song remind you of?
It reminds me of graduating high school, and moving forward in life to so much promise, hope, and opportunity.
Did that song come out the year you graduated high school?
Yes, 1998.
