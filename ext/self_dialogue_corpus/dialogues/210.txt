Do you like the newer Superman movies?
They are okay but I think they lost something in the translation.
What do you mean by that?
Well, it seems like they are trying to be "modern" instead of sticking to the script.  For example making Louis a single mom.
Yes, that's ridiculous and not necessary for the story.
This is supposed to be fantasy no need to make things more "realistic" to modern life.
I liked the script of the Superman movies Christopher Reeve played in.
Which is your favorite?
I liked Superman III which had Richard Pryor in it.
Yes, I liked the scenes where he stole all the fractional cents with the computer.
