Who do you think is the best player in the NFL?
Tom Brady, definitely.
I take it you're a New England Patriots fan then?
Not really. I'm just stating facts.
What makes Tom Brady so good in your opinion?
It's a fact. Who was the MVP at the last Superbowl?
Well it is true that Tom Brady won the the MVP in this year's Superbowl.
Not just this year. This was the fourth time he's won it.
Other players have won it multiple times though, not just him.
He's won Superbowl MVP more than any other player - four times. Joe Montana won it three times back in the 1980's
I personally think he's overrated.
I personally think you're being a snob. He has earned his accolades.
Don't you think it's time for him to retire?
To be honest I thought he would retire after he won MVP in Superbowl 2015. Yet he stayed playing, and came back to win MVP again in Superbowl 2017.
He's almost 40 years old now though. I think his career is coming to an end.
Yes, well it had to someday didn't it. He looks like he may still have some power left in him for another year or two though.
If he doesn't get injured first, maybe.
Yes at his age his body can't handle any serious injuries.
I couldn't handle that kind of injury at my age and I'm 22!
Thank goodness for all that padding and body protection they wear!
