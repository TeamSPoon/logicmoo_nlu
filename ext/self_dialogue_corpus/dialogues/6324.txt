Did you hear people are complaining about the new Beauty and the Beast?
Ugh. The outrage never stops.
Yeah, it's getting ridiculous.
So what are they complaining about?
Well, the new Beauty and the Beast has a gay character.
That doesn't seem objectionable to me.
Nor to me.
People can be the worst sometimes.
Yeah, and the ridiculous part about it is that Beauty and the Beast is about a woman falling in love with an anthropomorphic animal.
Yeah, there was no objection to that as far as I've seen.
