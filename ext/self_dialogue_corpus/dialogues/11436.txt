Hey, are you a Beatles fan?
Not really. I think their music is too old. I know about Love me Do and the old-sounding stuff.
I don't think it's old-sounding! I like the later psychedelic stuff like Helter Skelter.
I'm actually into more 90's music.
I see. Do you like Oasis?
Yes, definitely!
Well, they are really into the Beatles, and you can hear the influence in their music.
Really? Maybe I should give them a try. What album do you recommend?
I'd start with the classic Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band and then Rubber Soul.
My sister has Rubber Soul on CD. I'll give it a try.
