What do you think about Macklemore?
I think he is extremely talented.  He's a good rapper.
Does it bother you that he raps about controversial issues?
Why should it?  Some other rappers rap about drugs and sex.
Yeah, that makes sense.  He's just saying what he feels.
Yeah, and besides, he is more positive.  He does have some tongue in cheek funny songs though.
Yeah, I really like Downtown.
Downtown was more radio friendly.  He has dirtier songs.
Oh, I didn't reallize that.  I might have to look into it.
Yeah, I think you'd like him.
