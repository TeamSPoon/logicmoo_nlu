Did you get a chance to see Moana?
Not really, for some reason i wasn't interested in it, is it a musical?
Not really a musical, although it has a bit of singing in it.
Yeah, i know it has Dwayne Johnson, but i look for more action animations.
Well Moana is entertaining to say the least.
Well i might then stream it one day if i'm bored.
I think you should do it, it was a very popular movie.
I can see that.
Let me know when you're gonna watch, i might pop by.
Sure thing.
