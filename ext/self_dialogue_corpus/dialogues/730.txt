How do you think the Cowboys will do this year?
Will be tough to repeat last year I reckon.
Yeah, schedule is much harder.
That in itself will probably get them a few more losses.
I think they will still probably go 10-6.
Really?  That seems high to me.
I don't think so.  Why do you say that?
Well, the rest of the division all got better.
Philly maybe, Washington and the Giants will be the same.
Nah, I think they all made improvements.
But Dak will have another year as a starter.
Defenses will key on him more.
But he's experienced now and will adapt to the game.
They will still blitz him all the time.
That didn't rile him last year.
But that was last year.  Again, lots more tape to look at.
Well, the Cowboys will only get as far as he takes them.
Yep, QB play means everything.
I expect him to make the Pro Bowl again.
Competition is tough, so we'll see.
