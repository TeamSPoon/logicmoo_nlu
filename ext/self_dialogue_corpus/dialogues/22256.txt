Do you like western movies at all?
What, do you mean like movies made in the western world, in other words Hollywood?
I mean the western genre -- the kind of movie that usually has cowboys in it.
I guess so. I don't think they've made any in a long time.
They do still make westerns. The Magnificent Seven was a pretty big one that came out around last Christmas.
That sounds familiar. Who stars in that?
It has lots of good actors. Denzel Washington, Chris Pratt and Ethan Hawke are in it.
Cool. Are there any other good recent ones?
There were several that came out in 2016. There was The Revenant, for example.
Yes, I think I heard of that. Who was in that one?
That was with Leonardo DiCaprio. There was also The Duel and Forsaken in 2016.
Who was in those?
The Duel had Liam Helmsworth and Woody Harrelson. Forsaken had Donald and Keifer Sutherland.
The Sutherlands have been in movies for a long time, haven't they.
Yes. Keifer Sutherland has been in movies since the '60s.
He was in other stuff recently, though, wasn't he.
He was in the Hunger Games movies.
Who did he play?
He played President Snow.
Ah, yes. He was the main antagonist.
