What is your favorite pop song right now?
Hmm. I would have to go with anything by Justin Bieber.
I love him too! I love the song The Only One by him right now.
Me too! It is very upbeat and easy to sing along with.
Pop music in general is always fun to dance and sing along with.
I agree. I love playing pop music in the car because of that very reason.
Any other pop music you are loving right now?
Yeah, I really like That's What I Like by Bruno Mars.
Aah! Me too. That song always has me dancing!
Anything Bruno Mars sings has me dancing!
