Do you think Crosby has much of a career left?
Sure, on the right team.
Pens are that team I guess?
Definitely, they have stars around him.
So is Ovechkin being held back?
No, hes just not a team player.
I think he is, wouldnt you want a 50 goal scorer?
Yeah but how many assists does he have?
I know that but thats what his role is.
I dont know but back to Crosby I think he may never be healthy again.
Health has always been a problem for him.
Guys want to hurt him its bizarre.
He gets the reputation for that.
Cause he whines?
Yeah hes always crying and I think thats a problem.
I dont know, players are players I think thats fan created.
Well its not created, its well documented.
Hes a good player and he talks to refs so what.
Does McDavid unseat him as the leagues best?
Not just yet, but very soon.
