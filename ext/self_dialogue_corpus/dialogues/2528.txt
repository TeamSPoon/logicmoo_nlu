Hey I like that Seattle Seahawks Jersey
Are you a fan of theirs
Yes definitely, they have one of the best teams of the league
I certainly agree. They are my favorite
So.Did you get your jersey signed or is it a reprint
No. Its authentic C.J. Prosise signed this last year.
Wow. That might be worth alot in a few years
It's worth more to me now. I will never sell it.
A few years ago I had a pair of sweats signed by a pro quarterback, that cost twenty dollars, after they were signed they were worth a thousand dollars
Really? What pro quarterback ?
Crockett Gillmore
Wow. I hear he's the secret weapon for the Baltimore Ravens this year
That may be true. He's definitely got skill
I didn't know his paraphernalia was worth that much
May be worth even more. Who knows
Well as for my jersey I don't plan to sell it
Alright I believe you.
But I may change my mind if you offer two grand.
Okay, I'll give you two grand for that New York Jets jersey with the signature !
Nope. Its not for sale
