Whats your favorite Incubus album?
Wow thats tough, they have a big discography.
Yeah for me it is Light Grenades.
I dont like that one too much.
Why is that?
I feel like its distanced themselves from their pure sound.
I think thats crazy, it sounds like every other album.
I would rather listen to anything else.
So whats your favorite then?
Make Yourself by far.
That was the album that got me into them.
They had one before that.
Yeah it was called Fungus Amongus right?
That was their first ever
OH OK, you talking about Enjoy Incubus?
Yes thats the one
They had one more too but Make Yourself was so clean and produced well.
It had a ton of hits and it sounded very full.
Yeah I loved them so much, I have seen them play 7 times.
Jesus thats alot! I could never see a band that much.
