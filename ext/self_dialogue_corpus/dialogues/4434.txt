I saw that movie Split last night have you seen it?
No, was it good?
It was definitely tense.  This guy takes these three girls from a parking lot and holds them hostage only he's got multiple personalities.
Definitely sounds interesting.  Didn't M. Night Shyamalan do that one?
Yeah and its kind of related to Unbreakable but I won't spoil it for you.
Thanks, maybe he's making a come back.
I think so.  The Visit was good too.  I never did hate his movies though.
I thought Lady in the Water was an absolute bomb.
Oh yeah, that one was no good.  People didn't like The Village though and I did.
I though it was ok.  I called the twist from a mile away.
