Hey did you see any of the pregame stuff yet?
Nope, I think t starts soon though.
Oh sweet, I believe the Packers preseason games is at the end of August.
Oh cool, any work on Clay Matthews health?
Uh oh, I have not heard anything bad coming out of camp have you?
Not other than he had a might cut his long hair.
Ha! Good one!
The game that I really wanna see of the Lions vs. the Packers.
Hopefully Stafford is ready.
Yeah, I know the game is on November 6th.
The last time they matched up it was for the NFC North Title.
It feels like that was a long time ago.
I know man I feel like I am ready for some football and hot wings.
Do you ever play fantasy football?
Yep, but just between my wife and I.
Oh right on thats cool.
yeah, you should mention it to your wife and see if she would be interested.
I can try but she loves shopping on Sundays!
You might save money but getting her to watch football?
I couldn't agree with you more!
