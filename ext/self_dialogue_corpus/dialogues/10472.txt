Hey there
Whats cracking my friend
Just wanting to do something this good weekend
Well then look no farther
What are you up to then
Well i am hosting a concert tonight
What sort of concert
The best and biggest of all the cities  finest
Sounds intriguing tell me more
Well i am thinking we can get the place packed so i booked ten of the locals to play all night
Sounds like a good time
It will be for sure
Will their be drinks
What kind of question is that
A normal kind of question
Well of course their will be drinks why would their not be
Well that is a relief
So what do you say
Sure i will come on down
See you soon then
