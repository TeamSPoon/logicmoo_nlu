who do you wish you could see in concert?
I would pick joe cocker.
He has a very raspy sound to me.But I enjoy it.
Ya raspy in a good way. very good.
I think he must be very old now, maybe too old to tour.
He actually passed away in 2014 it was cancer.
Oh man, that is too bad. Sorry you never got to see him.
Maybe in the next life.. who knows.
he did have enough hits for two or three lifetimes.
He had a huge book but really they are interpretations of others songs. What is your favorite?
I like his You are so beautiful to me.
That is such a beautiful song, his voice lends itself so well to it.
Very raw and real and truly seems heartfelt.
I think he was so good at conveying emotions.
apparently he was a good showman physically as well.
Joe was pretty well know for his theatric body movements.
It would have been a neat concert to see, that was a good pick.
Ya I wish I could have seen him in concert so badly.
You have made me feel the regret of not seeing him now.
sorry, at least his music lives on.
