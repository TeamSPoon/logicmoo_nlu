What did you think about Lady Gagas halftime show at the Super Bowl?
It was great I really like Lady Gaga.
I do as well I was really happy she played all of her top hits.
I know it was awesome she didnt leave any hits out.
I also really liked how there were no guest performances and it was just her.
I actually would have liked to see some guest performances because those are my favorite.
Do you have a favorite song from Lady Gaga?
I do my favorite is Bad Romance
I dont think I can pick a favorite I like them all.
I understand that, hopefully she will return to perform again.
