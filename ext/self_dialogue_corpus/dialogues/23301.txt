So I just watched a movie, and I didn't like it.
Seriously? Which one?
It´s called 500 days of summer. Whit actors Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel.
Oh, I have watched it, why didn´t you like it? I thought it was very good.
It´s so hard breaking, how could she be like that to him?
Well, that's what the movie is about, about accepting break ups, and that life goes on, and you´ll meet someone else.
Yes, but I felt that it went to long, she totally broke his heart.
Well is only a movie, you don't have to get all mad about it, you are allowed to not like it.
I know I´m sorry, I really like both actors, it just this movie seemed depressing.
Well, I can name you a few movies with those actors that won't be romantically depressing.
Oh, please tell me, I need to erase the image I have of them in my mind.
Let´s start with Joseph Gordon-Levitt. Start by watching Inception, Snowden, 10 things I hate about you.
Snowden? Like the real Snowden?
Yes it´s a movie about his life, it´s really good, it´s not romantic, you´ll definitely think about him differently.
Ok, I will see it. What about Zooey?
You can watch The Happening, Our Idiot brother, I think she has more tv shows than movies.
Ok, I´ll give it a try. What is the movie 10 things I hate about you, about?
Oh you´ll love it! It´s about typical high school drama, but this one is definitely romantic, it´s a classic.
What other actors are there in the movie?
Heath Ledger, Julia Stiles.. There is a part where Heath Ledger sings, it´s amazing!.
