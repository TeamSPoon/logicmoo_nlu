What was your favorite decade for pop music?
Wow, that's a tough question.
Do you think it's modern pop music?
No it doesn't have the same feel as something from the 80s or 90s.
I would say mine is 80s pop music.
That's a good choice. There were a lot of good songs.
What about you?
I would say 90s because they seemed to figure out how to make the perfect pop song then.
They really did have a lot of hit songs in the 90s.
It seemed like they figured out the formula of how to make a great pop song in the 90s.
