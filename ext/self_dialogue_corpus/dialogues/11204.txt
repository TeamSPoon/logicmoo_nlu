I love going to Claire's.
Me too. I'm going today.
What do you buy there?
I love the headbands and earrings.
They have a great deal with now where you get three items when you buy three.
That's great. I'll take advantage of that.
I got cute earrings last time with cupcakes on them.
I got turtle ones myself.
Those sound cute.
They were blue and green turtles.
The cupcakes were silver and pink.
Did you get those earrings you're wearing now there?
No, those came from a thrift store. They're Celtic knots.
They're really nice. They go great with your outfit.
I like silger. It matches everything I think.
I agree about that.
I wear more silver than gold.
I like both but you're right about silver matching.
Gold dos too.
I suppose but I prefer silver a tiny bit I guess.
