Do you think that Grime will ever be a big subgenre in America?
I'm not too sure. Drake did it justice in exposing it on More Life, but I don't think it resonated with fans.
I agree. I'm not sure if Americans have that acquired yearning for rap with deep British accents.
Not just that, but it's a grittier type of music too.
Definitely. Regardless, rappers like Stormzy and Skepta are killing it with their delivery and flows.
I can definitely agree, Konichiwa was so underrated.
All of the guys on Boy Better Know have very diverse yet hard bars.
Exactly, and their sounds are all so different and fresh.
Sometimes I wish American rappers would step out of the box like British Grime artists do.
Yep, but for now, we have to deal with the copy cat flows.
