Would you say that Robocop is a satirical action film?
Absolutely. It satirizes the culture of consumerism and greed in America.
Yeah that seemed really evident in the way ridiculous commercials were placed into the film at intervals.
The commercials were pretty funny as well.
Yeah, I especially enjoyed the commercial for the 6000-SUX.
That was a good one. Did you think they made good use of violence?
Sometimes it felt unnecessary, but I think overall it added to the commentary on American culture.
How do you mean?
Well, I think in a way the audience is meant to feel shame for enjoying the ultra violence depicted on screen.
That is an interesting take.
