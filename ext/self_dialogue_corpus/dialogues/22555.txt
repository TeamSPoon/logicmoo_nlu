Did you ever see Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs?
I saw it, but I didn't care for it a whole lot.
Oh, I thought you liked animated movies, that's why I asked.
You're right, I often like animated movies, but that one was weird. I did like the second one much better.
Really? Why's that?
The second one had the foodimals, or whatever they called the food that turned into animals.
And you thought the first one was weird?
I know, but it had more heart to it in the second movie. Plus, I saw it in 3D.
Oh, you saw it in 3D? That must be what did it.
Not really. It made it more interesting, but the story was better too.
So I'm thinking, what's weirder, food raining from the sky, or food turning into animals?
Okay, forget I said the first one was weird. Maybe I just got used to the idea by the time the second one came out.
Whatever. So you did like the second one then?
Yes. It was cute. Your kids would like it.
I'm sure they would. I was wondering if I would be able to watch it with them.
Sure you can, it's enjoyable for adults too.
Okay. Maybe I can get it for the family to watch together.
Sounds good, then you can tell me what you thought of it.
I'll do that, and I'll tell you what my kids thought of it too.
All right. I'll look forward to finding out.
