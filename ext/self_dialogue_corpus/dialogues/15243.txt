What have you been listening to lately?
I've been listening to a lot of older stuff. I'm not crazy about any new music at the moment.
Oh really?
Ya, I've been listening to a lot of music from the 80s.
I love 80s music. I can't get enough of Madonna, Michael Jackson and all of the other big names!
You missed a big one. What about Prince? That's who I've been listening to the most.
Yes, I love Prince's music! My favorite songs have to be 1999 and Little Red Corvette.
Those are two of my favorites too.
My all time favorite is When Doves Cry though.
That's my favorite too!
When Doves Cry is from his movie Purple Rain right? Have you ever seen it?
Yes of course! Oh, and his song Let's Go Crazy is from Purple Rain too!
That was in the mid 1980s, that was such a great time!
I know, and Michael Jackson was also on the music scene releasing so many amazing songs.
His album Bad was my favorite.
I still have to dance when I hear the song Bad.
Yes, or The Way you Make me Feel.
There were so many number one songs on that album.
I think it had five number ones actually if I remember correctly.
Sounds about right!
