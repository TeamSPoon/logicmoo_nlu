Hey, do you want to join my NFL Fantasy Football League?
Yea!  I can't wait for the season to start!
Me neither!
When is your Fantasy draft?
It will be in mid-August, I'll send you an email invite when we have the date settled.
Sounds good!  Who are you liking this year?
I still think Tom Brady or Aaron Rodgers are the best pics for QB?  What do you think?
Yea, definitely Rodgers for sure!
You know I'm a die-hard Texan, I hope JJ Watt can keep it together this year!
Agreed!  He's the best DE in the league if he can stay free of injury.
What do you think of the Jags this season?
You know I'm from Jacksonville so I have a soft spot for the Jaguars but I honestly don't have much hope for them.
Yea but they did pick up Ramsey, I think he will be a solid player.
Yea I think so too, Myles Jack was also a good pick-up for them.
Jack is good, I just worry about him with injuries.
True, if he stays healthy though he should be solid.
I still don't see them getting anywhere near the Super Bowl though, they just can't seem to hold it together for an entire season.
Unfortunately I have to agree with you, some major changes have to happen in Jacksonville for them to ever get to a Super Bowl.
Well, I'll let you know about the draft.
Thanks man, looking forward to it!
