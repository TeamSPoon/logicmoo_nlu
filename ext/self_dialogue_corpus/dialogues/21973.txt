hey mate sup with you.
doing good.
what you up to though.
nothing much, just watching the classic "coming to america"
oyeah that movie never gets old.
i can watch it 5 times in a week and won't get bored.
is one of the all time romantic movie.
sure should definitely make that list.
where about is eddie murphy by the way, haven't seen him on any movies of late.
eddie has acted to many movies that i have lose count of ,so even if he's not acting anymore which i doubt then he's pay his due.
oh am not even disputing that, just meant he's still relevant and should have made a good actor on most of the new movies this year.
i presume so, like the movie "robin gate" would have been a bad idea if eddie murphy was used instead of L. Jackson.
oyeah that movie, they try to make Jackson a humorous character but we all know what jackson does best which is action, so sure eddie would have been a better character for the role.
you could tell L. Jackson was forcing himself to look funny when he has made so many movies that makes him a action man.
i concur.
i doubt though if Eddie would have taken the role, no matter the price tag.
oh, why do you think so.
remember the feud he had with MGM pictures and both settle it out in court.
oh that's so true and it was MGM that produced "robbin gate" hmm, who knows they also might not have ask eddie to play the role knowing he might not accept.
yeah, so L. Jackson was their closest option, just that i feel he is not at his best when he tries to go comedy.
