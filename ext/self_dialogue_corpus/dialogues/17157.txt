What is your favorite acoustic version of a pop song?
Do you mean a stripped down version sung by the original artist or a cover sung by a different artist?
Let's do stripped down version sung by the same artist first.
Ok, then The Cherry Tree Sessions, it is an amazing deep cut acoustic album by Lady Gaga.
I have that one. Poker Face from that album is absolutely amazing.
What is your favorite stripped down version sung by the same artist?
My favorite is the entire Lights Acoustic EP, it really brings out the content of the songs so much differently!
I haven't heard the acoustic version. I'll have to check that out. I like the original album a lot though.
You'll like the acoustic version then. I love acoustic versions of not acoustic songs and albums because it can be like a whole new song or album.
In my opinion it has to be a real acoustic version though, not just remixing a track.
I agree, it sucks when artists don't do a separate recording for the acoustic versions.
Exactly. Just putting the same vocal over a different track kinda ruins it.
Are there anymore stripped down versions that you really like?
Do Kesha's Deconstructed mixes count as stripped versions?
Oh most definitely!
I love how the Deconstructed mix of Blow adds a layer of darkness and eeriness.
I agree, that whole album is off the charts.
I feel like on that album, she shows her true singing talent.
Right? A lot of people don't know how truly amazing her voice is.
I hope she puts out a ballad album eventually. That would be amazing!
