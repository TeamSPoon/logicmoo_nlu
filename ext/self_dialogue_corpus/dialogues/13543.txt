Did you like The Force Awakens?
I really didn't.
No? Why not?
I thought is was just a poor retelling of A New Hope.
I thought it was cool to see the old characters older.
I didn't. Harrison Ford looked like he really didn't want to be there. And those aliens they fought when he came up looked fake.
Yeah that was some bad CGI. But the rest of the movie looked good.
I think the New Order or whatever looked way too glossy. The Empire was crushed, now there's a bigger Empire suddenly?
Yeah that was confusing.
There wasn't a sense of setting in it. Just a safe rehash.
