Hey man, you ready for the NFL season to start?
Yeah dude, not having any games going on is driving me crazy.
Haha I feel you, the year is more fun when the games are going.
Yeah, for sure. I hope we see a game as exciting as the super bowl again this year.
Yeah that game was one for the archives. Can't believe the Broncos pulled it off like they did.
It was awesome!
Speaking of which, did you get a chance to watch the draft?
Nah sadly not this year, had some business so I couldn't really pay attention to it.
Understandable, I didn't really catch it while it was happening but I did read that it was the most attended draft in history.
Wow really? That's pretty crazy.
Yeah this was the first time it was held outside so people could gather around, apparently there was over 200,000 people there.
Crazy!
Wonder if the Bears will turn it around this year...
Don't hold your breath man, they did really terrible in 2016.
Yeah I know, but they are still my home team so I have to root for them.
You don't have to root for anyone, besides you're in California now, pick a new team to root for.
Have you seen the teams around here? I will just stick with the Bears.
Fair enough haha, forgot how bad things were over there. Man you sure know how to live around some stinkers.
Very funny. We all anyway man I gotta go do some stuff I will catch you this saturday.
Yeah for sure, see you there man.
