Did you see the third lion king?
No I did not. Did you?
Yeah I saw it.
How was it?
I do not recommend it at all.
Yeah I figured it would not be that great of a movie.
It is no where near as good as the first.
I will make a note not to see it.
Have you seen the musical of the lion king?
Oh yeah it was great.
