Did you like Frozen?
I thought it was OK.
Yeah I believe it was a little overrated.
Just a little?
Well some of the stuff was just too much.
There was alot of singing.
But I thought it could have been better.
Well maybe they are doing a sequel.
Its Disney they definitely are.
They did make a ton of money off of it.
