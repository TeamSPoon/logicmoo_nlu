What is your favorite batman film?
I have to go old school and say Batman Returns. Yours?
I think the newer nolan films are far superior. Though I do like keaton as batman.
Who was the worst Batman on film?
I think that is Ben affleck for sure.
Agreed. he was pretty awful.
What about your vote the worst batman film in the franchise?
That has to be The Batman and Robin Movie. You?
My pick for the worst film of them all is Batman Forever. I actually left at one point I thought it was so awful.
That movie was pretty bad. I forgot about it entirely that may be worst than the batman and robin film.
I certainly think so.  I do like micheal keaton though.
Me too. Great Bat man! I did not like the movie birdman though.
I thought it was okay. Unique story and it was neat filming in mostly continuous takes.
The technique is masterful but the film was boring to me.
I will say I don't think it deserved the oscar.
Ya, I prefered other movies far more that year.
Oh ya like what?
Whiplash, or even Boyhood. Did you see them?
I have seen them both. I loved whiplash. That would have been my top pick for best picture.
Mine as well. So well acted and directed. Felt so real and engrossing.
