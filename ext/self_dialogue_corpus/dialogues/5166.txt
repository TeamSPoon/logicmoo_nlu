Did you ever see Brave?
Oh my goodness, yes!  That movie was awesome!
It was beautiful to look at.  And the movie was so awesome!
I know!  How great was it that she decided to stand up for herself and not be forced to marry any of those losers?
Yeah, that arrow contest was really cool
Also, I loved her relationship with her mom
Wasn't it great when her mom  was turned into a bear, but she still kept her personality, down to wearing her crown?
The mother  was payed by Emma Thompson
Yeah,  and Merida was Kellly McDonald
It was a good family movie, great mother/daughter relationship
