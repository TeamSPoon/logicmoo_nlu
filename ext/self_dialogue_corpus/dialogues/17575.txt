I really hope the Dresden Dolls are still together.
Who are they?
They're a punk duo out of Boston, sort of cabaret-like and definitely odd.
What do you mean odd?
Well essentially they're a pianist and a drummer who both play other things and sing, but since there's only two of them you don't get a lot of instruments at once.
So not your standard rock/punk instrumentation then?
No, most of the time it's just piano, drums, lead-singer and back-up.
And they're good?
They're really good, as long as you like them.
That's an odd statement.
The thing is the singing's pretty messy and a lot of the time the piano is thumpy and messy too.
So where does the "good" come in?
Their songs are interesting. Amanda (the pianist/singer) has a really neat voice. It's low and sounds kind of like a cello.
Well that sounds pretty, if a bit odd for a girl.
An angry cello.
Now you're just making things up. Have I heard any of their songs?
The most popular one I think was Coin Operated Boy. A lot of people saw the video on Youtube.
Oh, I think I do remember that! They had white-face on right?
Yeah. Do you remember her voice now?
I do. It Is really low. Not sure I'd say angry cello but she definitely has an unusual singing style!
