Who is your favorite director of all time?
I'd have to go with David Fincher.
Really? Over Scorcese, or Spielberg, or anyone on that level?
Yeah, Fincher to me has turned out consistently outstanding work that pushes the envelope in a way that Spielberg doesn't really do.
I like a lot of his movies, but I don't think there's a movie on the level of Taxi Driver, or Goodfellas.
Maybe not Taxi Driver - I agree that it's one of the greatest movies ever. But Fincher has made some gems.
Like what?
Fight Club, Zodiac, Seven, the Social Network. The list goes on.
I thought Seven was kind of cheesey and exploitive at times.
Did you see it when it first came out, or only years afterward?
Probably years afterward. I was kind of young when it first came out.
Then what I'd say is that you probably don't realize that Seven seems cheesey and cliched because for years afterward, there were like 3 movies a year made who were ripping off Seven.
What does that matter?
Well, when you've seen the same plot and themes over and over, they start to seem cliched. But Seven was the original.
I see what you mean. And Fight Club WAS a great movie. I never got into Zodiac?
Really? I think it's Fincher's best movie.
It just seemed kind of slow paced, and in the end there wasn't really a resolution.
It was telling a story that doesn't have a resolution, though!
I'll maybe give it another shot. But I'm going with Martin Scorcese for best director of all time!
Fair enough. He's top 3 for me, no question.
