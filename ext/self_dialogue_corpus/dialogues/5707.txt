Have you gotten to see Finding Dory yet?
No, but my kids have been asking me to see it.
It was a good movie your kids will like it, my kids especially liked hank the octopus.
They added a lot of new characters to this movie.
Yes, but they kept the some old ones too like Dory, Nemo, and that turtle Crush.
Oh, yeah! My kids love Crush they thought his surfer talk was funny.
It is available to rent at the local rental place in town, we just got it there.
Ok, thanks I will have to check it out.
Enjoy the movie let me know how the kids like it.
I will, thanks.
