What do you think was DeNiro's best work?
Can I say Meet the Fockers?
I mean you can say it, but you would be a bufoon.
I dont think it was The Godfather.
Yeah I will agree if you say that.
I would have to say maybe Casino?
Thats not that bad of a selection
Yeah it really is not, he played a top flight actor.
I liked him in Goodfellas.
That was such a strong film.
He really did it with all those mobster type films.
Yeah he was almost typecasted for awhile.
Now he does old persons comedies
Well he himself is getting up there in age
I think his later roles have not been that good
I dont know I guess its the law of averages
Strange that would happen
Do you think he would reprise any of his older roles?
No I think he wants to get away from the mobster genre.
He hasnt done one of those films in over 20 years though
