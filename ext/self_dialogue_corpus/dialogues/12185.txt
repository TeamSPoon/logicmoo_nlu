Want to hear a fun fact about the third movie?
I imagine you're going to tell me anyway.
Indeed I am.  It was originally called Revenge of the Jedi.
Instead of Return of the Jedi?
Yeah.  They changed it weeks before opening the film.
I like return better anyway.
I guess they thought it didn't make sense because a Jedi shouldn't seek revenge.
Yeah, they don't seem vengeful to me.
You would have thought someone would have caught that earlier.
Guess they were busy getting the film finished, eh?
