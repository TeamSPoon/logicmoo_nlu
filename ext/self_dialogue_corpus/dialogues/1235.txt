Ugg,it is almost fall.
Yea so?
Football Season..
Wow that is right, that is great.
Really?? I hate football season.
Wow, I never heard anyone say that before.
Well, I do. I find the game monotonous.
I think football is exciting. The Cowboys are my favorite team.
I do not have a favorite team but it I did it would be the Eagles I guess.
Why don't you like it?
It is long. My husband sits his butt in front of the tv all Sunday afternoon and it is so boring.
Well he likes it , right
Yea, but I don't.
Do you watch it with him.
Absolutely not. It is a big waste of my time.
So what do you do then?
Anything but watch football.
Do his friends come over?
Sometimes and then I get stuck cooking.
Sounds like fun!
