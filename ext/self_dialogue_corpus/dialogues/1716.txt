What do you think of the Bills chances?
No chance at all.  They have a good defense and rushing but not much else.
Yeah, they need to keep with a coach for maybe five minutes.
Yeah, every time you change systems it makes playing harder.
Especially against a team that's have the same coach for nearly two decades.
Yeah, have fun beating the Pats.
Bills also need a QB.  I'm not on board with Tyrod Taylor.
Truthfully me neither.  Overrated.
They are stuck in that dreaded middle.
I see where you're going.  Not good enough to move forward, too good to get good picks.
Yeah, free agents don't see them as worthy, and drafting in the middle so they can't get those franchise players.
Yeah, they need to draft better too.
Start with finding a good quarterback.
Yes, a pocket passer might be nice.
And can you believe they let Hogan get away?
Oh I know.  Now he's living it up on the Pats.
He's a monster out there.
That's what happens when you have a good QB throwing to you.
I agree, Brady makes a difference.
And a deep receiving corps.  When everyone is doubling Gronk or Eddleman you're always wide open.
