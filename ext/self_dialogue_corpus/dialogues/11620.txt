Are you into the Beatles?
I can see their impact for sure.
I just dont find alot of their stuff that good.
You might be the only one to say that.
It definitely spans decades.
Yeah I will say that its still relevant today.
Many of their hits still get radio air time.
I find that I can tolerate them for a little bit.
But you never just listened to an album straight through?
No because the music stylings vary so much.
