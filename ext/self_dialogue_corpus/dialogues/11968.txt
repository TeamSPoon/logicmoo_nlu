What Star Wars character do you dislike the most?
I really don't like Jar Jar Binks!
Why don't you like that character?
Jar Jar Binks is just really annoying!
I also find Jar Jar Binks extremely annoying.
I think they just added Jar Jar Binks as a comic relief character.
Yes I totally agree with you!
There are moments I found funny when I saw Jar Jar Binks on screen.
The way Jar Jar Binks says "me" as "meesa" makes me laugh.
It also makes me laugh!
