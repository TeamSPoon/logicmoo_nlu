I am still amazed by Superbowl LI.
You're just saying that because you're from Boston.
Yes.  I thought the game was over.
The Falcons played a great first half.
Yes, they scored three unanswered touchdowns.
The interception was a killer.
So it seemed.  21-3 at the half.
Lady Gaga was great at halftime.
I did not watch it.
It was 28-3 just a few minutes later.
I was pretty much devastated by then.
But they came back.
It still looked bad at 28-12.
Then the fumble.
They had some life then.
28-20 soon afterward.
I cannot believe the Falcons took themselves out of field goal range.
Leading up to the great Edelman catch, and the tie.
I knew they would win in overtime.
The only time they had the lead, 34-28.  Amazing.
