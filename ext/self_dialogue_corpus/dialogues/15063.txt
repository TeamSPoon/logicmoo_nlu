Have you ever seen Zombieland?
Is that a horror movie?
Not really, it's more of a comedy.
Oh, is it the one with Woody Harrelson?
Yeah, he's in it.
There are zombies in it though.
Yeah, and the people are traveling together.
To some kind of fun park in California, right?
Yeah, but when they get there, it's already overrun by zombies.
Yeah, I've seen it.
