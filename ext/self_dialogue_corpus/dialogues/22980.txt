Name me a movie that you love, that most other people don't like, or make fun of.
Ha, I have a lot of those. Today I will say Hook, with Robin WIlliams and Dustin Hoffman.
I saw that one. Julia Roberts played Tinkerbell.
And it was directed by Steven Spielberg, one of my favorite directors.
I recall a lot of people didn't really get into it. Why do you love it?
I love the premise, first of all. The idea that Peter Pan, the boy who never grew up in Neverland, followed Wendy to the real world and grew up to become a stressed out yuppie who forgot how to play, is priceless.
I must say, casting Robin Williams was brilliant. He was, in many ways, a giddy little child wrapped up in a man's body.
He was good at playing stressed out Peter, but it was just lovely when he embraced his inner Pan and became a child at heart again.
What else did you like about the movie?
Well, the production values are outstanding. The sets were so elaborate and beautiful.
I think one of the criticisms was the huge budget.
But it's all there on the screen, at least. It's a feast for the eyes.
I think Julia Roberts is a feast for the eyes, personally. But they trapped her in that horrible outfit. They didn't even dress her like the classic Disney Tinkerbell.
Yeah, that was a miss on their parts. They made up for it a little bit in the sequence where Tinkerbell becomes as big as Peter to confess her feelings for him.
Yes, I wish she had been dressed in that lovely fairy outfit the whole time.
I also liked Dustin Hoffman as Hook. He had a little tongue in cheek energy, but mostly he played it straight.
I really liked the swordfight between Hook and Peter at the end.
Hoffman and Williams worked with a fencing master to make it look great. And the flying scenes were good too.
Those were the olden days when there was no CGI to do the flying sequences.
That makes the on-set effects all the more special, because there were guys sweating blood to pull them off. I loved the result.
