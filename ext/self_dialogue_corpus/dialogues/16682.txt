Did you hear the new Ellie Goulding song?
I haven't. Do you think I'd like it?
I think so! She's so talented, I have a hard time believing anyone wouldn't like her.
Tell me about it, and her, then.
Okay! Well, she started out as an indie folk type singer, do you remember the song Lights?
Oh yes, I do! I remember liking it, but I didn't bother listening to anything else of hers.
Well, she's taken a natural evolution since then and her latest album is more electronic dance now.
Oh really? Not like in a mindless way though, right?
Not at all! Her lyrics are still really meaningful, and of course her voice is one of a kind.
I think I remember that she was with Skrillex, is her music like that?
It's a little less dubstep, but she is not afraid to experiment at all!
What do you think your favorite song of hers is? If you can pick, that is.
Oh wow, that is a hard choice! I guess I'd have to say Anything Can Happen.
What do you like the most about it?
Well, her acapella in the beginning sounds amazing for one thing. It would have to ultimately be about the lyrics, though.
What do you like most about them?
That it explores her fear at things changing, but also being open to the randomness of life.
I think I would like it! Is there anything else I need to know about her music?
Not really, just that to keep an open mind, I feel like you will love her!
Thank you, I'm looking forward to it now!
