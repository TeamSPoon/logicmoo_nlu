Did you listen to Emo music as a kid?
Oh, yes. I loved the Get Up Kids.
I actually just saw Matt Pryor from the get up kids live!
No way! How was it?
Honestly pretty good, but I wish he played a longer set and more Get Up Kids songs.
What songs did he play?
Out of Reach and Valentine were the ones I can recall first.
Love those songs!
What was really cool, was his daughter played with him. She is 15 and really talented.
Aw, that is so sweet!
Yah. And Matt Skeeba from Alkaline trio was there performing!
Oh cool. I liked them as a kid, too.
Yah I never really got into Alkaline Trio so I didn't know any of the songs.
I bet he wishes that he could be in Blink 182 like that other guy.
Oh I know! Talk about hitting the jack pot.
I wonder how much he more he makes now?
In the millions, don't you think? With touring and a hit album?
I agree. And they won a grammy, right?
Yah I think they did win a grammy.
I want to see them one day!
