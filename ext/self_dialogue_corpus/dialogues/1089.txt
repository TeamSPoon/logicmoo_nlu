Who is your favorite NFL team these days?
I have two - one AFC and one NFC.
That is funny - I am kind of the same way.
Oh which ones are your favorites.
Well AFC - the Denver Broncos are my favorite and my most favorite overall.
I like watching them too, Seems like they are usually good!
And my favorite NFC team is the Washington Redskins.
Thats my number one team - lifelong Redskins fan.
I live near DC so I see alot of games and hear alot about them.
I grew up there, but live up near Boston now - so I am a Patriots fan too.
That is funny - we are similar I think, I spent alot of time in the Denver area - loved the Broncos
And we both like the teams where we live also.  I'd love to see them both in the Super Bowl.
I feel the same - if the Broncos and Redskins were in the Super Bowl - I think I would try to get tickets and go.
I think the weak side of that is thee Redskins though - they are not ready for Prime Time yet.
I agree they definitely are not super bowl bound. How about the Patriots? You think they can repeat?
With Brady and Bellichek - they seem to always have a chance.
Yeah great pair for sure! I think they are the concensus favorites to make it too the SuperBowl this coming season.
Yeah they should be better with the trades they made and Gronkowski back.
I know its amazing they won the SuperBowl without him last year.
Yeah he gone the whole playoff run.  Last year was definitely all Brady all the time.
