What did you think of that movie where Batman and Superman fought each other?
I didn't like that one.  It was too weird for me.
Oh.  Well, have you seen the new Wonder Woman movie?
Not yet, I think I'll wait until it's out to stream.
Sounds like you are not in too much of a hurry to see it.
I'm really not. I'm old school and this Wonder Woman is not going to be like the real one.
I agree. The real Wonder Woman was great and she was really likeable.  This one doesn't seem that way.
I know.  It's kind of a let down.  I think they just sexed her up to sell tickets.
I think so too.  Oh well, at least there's a new Spiderman movie coming out. WIll you watch that one?  I'm looking forward to seeing it myself.
I am going to see that, and at the movies! It looks really good!
