What do you think about Superman movies?
I like the ones with Christopher Reeve.
Really? They are kind of cheesy.
But they are better than that new one with Brandon Routh.
Oh, I forgot that one. I like the newest ones.
Those are OK but they kind of go on too long.
I liked Batman vs. Superman.
I liked that one too. Most people don't give it any credit.
I am looking forward to Justice League.
Honestly, I like the Superman on the Supergil TV Show better.
