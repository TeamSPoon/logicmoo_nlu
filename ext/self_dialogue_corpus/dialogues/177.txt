Do you like Batman films?
I loved the Christopher Nolan ones.
The Dark Knight, that was an amazing film.
It showed a side of Batman we never had really seen in the older ones.
Like the Micheal Keaton and Val Kilmer ones?
Yes, those had such a humor undertone. The Nolan ones were dark, but realistic.
His version made me think Batman could really happen, you know?
Like it was possible. No silly magic or anything like in the others.
Right. I liked the Joker too.
Heath Ledger did a wonderful job capturing the essence of the Joker, but making him believable.
