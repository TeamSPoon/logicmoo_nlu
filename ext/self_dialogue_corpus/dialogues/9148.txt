Hey do you remember U2's Boy album?
Yeah, that was such a great album. They have had a really long career.
What do you think is your favorite album by them?
Joshua Tree maybe. No War.
Both excellent choices. I love Sunday Bloody Sunday.
With or Without You....all I have to say.
Yeah but those are definitely different times and the music reflects that.
Yeah, still those guys influenced a lot of music.
The Alarm kind of reminds me of that time period too. I mean for Boy.
That's a good band. Wonder what ever happened to them.
