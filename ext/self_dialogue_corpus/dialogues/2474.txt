What do you think is the toughest division in the NFL?
I would have to say right now it is the AFC West.
You got a lot of good teams there.
Denver has an awesome defense.
Oakland had an awesome team.
They did until David Carr got hurt.
Yeah.  They ended up losing to Houston in the playoffs.
Kansas City is usually tough.
Arrowhead Stadium is a tough stadium to play in as a visitor.
It is usually one of the lowest stadiums in the league.
Andy Reid is a good coach.
San Diego can come up and surprise people.
They have had a lot of good years in the past decade.
They had an explosive offense.
I would also say that the NFC East can be tough.
Yeah Dallas should be a great team again.
The New York Giants always play people tough.
They do and they seem to catch fire in the playoffs.
Odell Beckham is probably the best receiver in the game.
Washington and Philadelphia can make the playoffs too.
