Do you know any good Indie artists I could try out?
Bon Iver is indie, I like him alot.
What kind of stuff does he have out?
He has one called Skinny Love, has that singer songwriter feel to it.
Like John Mayer?
No, more like Bob Denver. He has a real rugged feel to his voice, and a real natural feel to his music.
I like songs like that , ones I can feel the sound you know? Easy on the effects.
His stuff is all really pure. He does one called I can't make you love me, really beautiful and pure.
Do you know any more I might like if I like him?
Maybe, The XX. They are similar, but a bit more edge to them.
I do not think I have heard of them either.
They have a song called, "Angels". It is really moving, and kind of creep, but beautiful .
I like those almost etheral songs.Like Lorde sings.
Lorde is more pop, but she really does have an other world sound.
I like her Royals song.
If you like that, there may be a few Taylor Swift songs you might like.
I have heard her, of course, but never really got into any of her stuff beyond what is on the radio.
She does a few really deep, more indie sounding songs on her 1989 album.
I will have to check it out.
Make sure to look past the pop tunes, and see what else she has to offer.
