Have you seen the new Guardians of the Galaxy yet?
I have!  It was so good!
What was your favorite part?
I really liked the end scene with Yondu and Peter.
I loved Baby Groot!
Oh, I did too, but I thought Drax really knocked it out of the park!
I did like how they went more in depth about his character.
It was hilarious when he talked about meeting his wife
I guess now we know that he really does hate dancing.
Did you notice that Groot would stop dancing every time Drax looked at him?
Yeah, what was that about?
Apparently, it is just because Drax hates dancing.
Ah, that makes sense.
It also makes the opening scene even better.
I think that was really cleverly done.
I loved the way the characters related to Baby Groot too
Especially at the end when he was sleepy and they were passing him around
I think it really allowed for the others characters to look more human
Even Rocket has a soft spot for Baby Groot
Baby Groot is the only one Rocket likes.
