Do you have a favorite rap artist?
I do. I think it would have to be Kendrick Lamar.
Man, he is such a great rapper.
Yea, I like his music, but I also like the message behind his words.
True. He is so talented and makes good music.
Yea, I just bought his album Good Kid M.a.a.d city on vinyl and can't stop playing it.
Oh man, that is a great album. I love the song Drank.
You mean Swimming Pools?
Yea. That one. Also, Bitch Dont Kill my Vibe is such a nasty, but great song
I couldn't agree more.
