What do you think of the Transformer movies?
I really liked the first one, but that was about it
Yeah, they became pretty bad after the first one.
Right, the first one had some good lines and felt fresh
Was that Shia Labeouf in that one?
Yes, he was the main character.
And who was the girl in that one?
Megan Fox.
Right, she was pretty good looking
Yes, was able to get a few more roles, but haven't seen much of her since
Shia Labeouf was good in that role.
Yes, I haven't heard much from him since.
Sometimes that tends to happen. Start losing the streak
I liked some of the special effects as well.
Yes, Michael Bay always goes for the big explosions.
Yes, did you watch any of the subsequent movies?
I tried watching the second one, but couldn't finish it since it was so bad.
Yeah, they fell off quite a bit
Definitely. Oh well, I guess we have the first one to admire.
Yes, that is true.
