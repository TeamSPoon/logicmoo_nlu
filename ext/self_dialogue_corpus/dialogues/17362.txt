Do you like Jay Z?
Yes I do.
When was the last time he made an album.
I'm really not sure but I don't think it was that long ago.
He hasn't been very consistent though.
No he hasn't.
He dabbles in tv/movies and I imagine a lot of other hobbies these days.
Music seemed to be his passion once upon a time but seems to have moved past that now.
What's your favorite song of his?
Big Pimpin.
That's the song that made him and still his best.
It's definitely his most memorable.
I agree with you on that.
I wish he would come back hard with a great album.
Me too.
I think his days are done though as a great rapper.
Why?
He has that old school 90's style that just doesn't fit anymore.
He could adapt.
He could but I don't see it.
