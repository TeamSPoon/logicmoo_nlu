Have you seen the new movie Baby Driver?
No. I have never heard of it what is it about?
A tinnitus-suffering getaway driver who uses his headphones to drown out the ringing, and jobs for a mob boss to pay for petrol.
Sounds pretty interesting.
It is there is alot of cool actors also
Who are they?
Ansel Elgor is one of the near mute actors.
I am not sure who that is.
Jamie Foxx is a co star.
I like him, he cracks me up!
