So did you watch this year's NFL Draft?
Yeah I did. Not only did I watch it, I actually went to Philadelphia for it!
Wow, that's great! How was it?
It was cool. There was a lot of people!
Were there a lot of Packers fans there?
Yeah I guess. But it was 99% Eagles fans. Which I guess isn't surprising, but kinda is?
What do you mean?
I think I expected there to be a lot more of fans from other teams from around the entire NFL, but it was very Philly dominant.
Well, it was in Philadelphia. So that makes sense.
I mean, yeah, but you'd think there would have been a lot of travelers looking to experience it.
What team was second most in fans?
Actually. It probably was the Browns.
Wow really? Thats weird.
Yeah, well I guess it was their Super Bowl. Haha.
It isnt that close to Philly either. So that's interesting.
Yeah but there was some suspense around their pick. And now all their fans can say they were there when they took Miles Garrett.
....and not Mitch Trubiskey. haha.
Yeah that was probably the craziest part of the draft. Nobody saw that coming.
The Bears traded up ONE Pick for him!
Yeah they must have thought someone else was gonna trade up. It's going to be fun to look at in the future!
