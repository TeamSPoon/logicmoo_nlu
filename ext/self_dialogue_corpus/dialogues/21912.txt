What was your favorite movie?
Picking one is hard, but , There will be blood.
That was such an intense movie.
I think that intensity has a lot to do with the score. It is like three or four notes but so evocative.
That and also Daniel Day Lewis.
He is beyond superb in his acting.
Is he your favorite actor?
I think he very well may be my favorite. He is so devoted.
To say the least. he like is the most method actor ever.
He can get very wrapped up in the character. But also what makes his performances so great.
It is like he is truly living the role. I heard he can be hard to be around depending on who he is portraying.
Ya I heard that as well. Would not have wanted to be around during his GANGS OF NEW YORK DAYS.
I am so sad about the news he is quitting acting.
I am sad if it is true. But I somehow doubt it.
I hope you are right but what makes you think he is not serious. He is a serious guy.
He takes all these super long breaks between roles and I think if the right role came up he may do it.
Well I do know he is very selective in his roles.
Ya Scorcesse and leo had to convince him to Gangs personally.
True. But everyone needs a push sometimes.
I think some future role will push him back to acting.
