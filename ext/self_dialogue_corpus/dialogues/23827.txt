I love movies, do you?
Who does not love movies.
What kind do you think are the best.
I love comedies.
What comedies do you like best?
I like anything that is sort of raunchy.
Like Sausage Party?
Yes, with Seth Rogan?
Thought it was so funny. Do you like other adult cartoon movies?
I do not think I know any.
There is Roger Rabbit.
I forget about that one.
I liked how they mixed animation with real life.
I loved the bunny in there.
Roger? He always had the jokes.
I loved the way it ended.
All happy.
I watched it when I was a kid.
I did not even notice some of the jokes were really for adults.
Even some of the scenes, like the ones with Jessica Rabbit were a bit much.
