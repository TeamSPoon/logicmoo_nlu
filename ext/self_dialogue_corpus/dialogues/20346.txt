Do you like movies based upon Bible stories?
I really have not seen too many.
Did you see the ten commandments which is on at Easter time every year?
You mean the one with Charlton Heston?
Yes that's the one.
I saw the new version in the theater a couple of years ago.
What was that called?
It was called Exodus: Gods and Kings
How was that?
It was a lot more graphic then the Ten Commandments movie.
Were the special effects good?
Yes the plaques were much more graphic but I would say the narration and acting was not as good.
All the old movies have better dialogue.
I agree.
Since they did not have special effects the story was based much more around the dialogue.
I noticed that too there is a lot more dialogue at a more sophisticated level in old movies.
Charlton Heston was a much better actor as an example.
Yes, he had a dramatic flair to him.
There is something lost with all the special effects today.
Yes, it is a trade off it seems.
