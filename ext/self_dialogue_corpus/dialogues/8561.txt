Have you heard the new Katy Perry and Migos track?
I didn't know they collaborated.
Yes they made a fun song.
Ok I want to hear that.
Migos does a great job of singing fun lyrics.
How does Katy sound.
She matched with him well, her lyrics are super upbeat and exciting.
Ok that sounds like a good song for going out at night.
Yes it is perfect for that.
Ok thanks for telling me.
