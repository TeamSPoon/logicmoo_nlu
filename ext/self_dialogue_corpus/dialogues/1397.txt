Who do you think will go to the Super Bowl this year?
I think the Falcons have a good chance.
What about the Patriots?
I think they also have a great chance.
Matt Ryan is a stud.
He had a great year last year and I expect the same this year.
We will see, I still think the Patriots are going to win it.
I think that's a safe bet, but watch out for the Dolphins.
The Dolphins?!
Yes, the Dolphins have the tools this year to be great.
I don't think that this is their year, maybe next year.
You will be surprised. They made some necessary signings.
Yes, but they still don't have that start QB.
Tannehill has grown a lot, so we will see.
Yes, but still not the greatest.
I agree, but I think they may surprise you.
Hopefully they will! I like it when they're relevant.
They were garbage for like a decade, unfortunately.
Last year they definitely made great strides.
Hopefully the Phins will do so again this year!
