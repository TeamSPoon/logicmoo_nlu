Did you ever see the movie version of Buffy the Vampire Slayer?
I have not. I watched the TV show. Was it any good?
I think its fair to say it wasn't very good.
It probably wasn't Joss Whedon, then.
Actually, it was. He changed a lot of stuff for the studio, they wanted it to be funny.
So, is it set at the same time?
No, it's set before buffy moves from LA. None of the TV cast are in it.
What about Giles?
Not even Giles, she has a different Watcher.
She's always been my favorite superhero, i'll have to watch it just for that reason!
