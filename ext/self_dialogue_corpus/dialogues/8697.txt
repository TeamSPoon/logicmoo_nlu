Hey, did you go see Weezer's recent show?
Oh yeah, it was awesome.
Really? I thought they aren't so good live.
Oh no, they did a sweet rendition of Surf Wax America mashed up with Holiday.
That sounds like it would be really weird.
It kind of was, but it sounded fantastic. They also played El Scorcho and Say It Ain't So.
Did they play newer music too?
Of course. They played Beverly Hills.
What do you think of their new hit about summer?
Feels Like Summer? I love the melody.
