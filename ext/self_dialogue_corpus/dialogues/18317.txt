Do you like any particular kind of music?
Yeah, I love hip hop.
What kinds of hip hop artists do you like?
I don't like very many, but I like Based God.
Who's that? I've never heard of them.
He's kind of a satire hip hop artist that does silly songs and videos on youtube.
Are they any good?
Actually, most of them are terrible, but they are very funny.
Why would you like that kind of music then?
You can't help but like it after a while, the songs get stuck in your head.
What are some of the songs about?
Some of them are about Ellen Degeneras, which is about 90% of all the lyrics.
That's very strange. What else?
There's a song about parking a car and eating won ton soup.
That's not quite what I expected when you mentioned their name.
Not a lot of people know about him actually.
How did you discover him?
He's kind of considered a meme amongst the internet community.
Oh, so he's like a joke?
Yes, but you still end up having a respect for his silly hip hop anyways.
