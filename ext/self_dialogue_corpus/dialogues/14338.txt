Which conference is the strongest for NCAA basketball?
Mens or womens?
Womens.
I have no idea. I don't watch that because it's crap. Whichever UConn is in.
Okay then. How about mens?
Despite the long-standing dominance of the ACC, they haven't been as good.
They just won the tournament this year. UNC was 33-7 and the national title. Are you blind?
No, you can't watch sports if you're blind. Duke, FSU, Louisville, and Notre Lame all had down seasons recently.
So, who is better?
Bear with me...the Big Ten was the best this year.
What? HOW?
Well, despite MSU's down year (which was due to injuries), they only had three sub-.500 teams this eyar.
So?
Well, Maryland, Purdue, Wisconsin and Michigan were all highly-ranked this year at various points, and pretty much just lost to each other.
You're saying that they just beat each other up?
Yup. Most of the Big 10 team losses were to each other.
I don't buy it, sorry, ACC or bust.
That's so narrow-minded. I bet you support OSU in football, too.
Yeah, I do.
I think your priorities are off.
