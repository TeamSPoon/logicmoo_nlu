Hey, Elizabeth, how would you like to go see a movie tonight?
Sounds great! What would you like to see?
I don't know... how about that new horror movie at the Arlington Theater?
Oh, I heard about that. It sounds a little scary to me. I'm more into romantic movies. Or maybe a romantic comedy.
No way! I hate that kind of stuff!
Really? Well then, what kinds of movies do you like?
I guess I'm really into action and adventure type of movies.
Oh yeah, well I guess they are okay, as long as they aren't too bloody. I also heard about this great new musical that just came out. What do you think about that?
Musical? I don't know. That doesn't sound too exciting. Is there anything we can agree on?
It doesn't seem like it. Oh, I remember another movie that came out last week. It's a mystery and it had a little romance and some action, too. I heard it's pretty exciting because nobody can guess who the killer is and it has a surprise ending. What do you think about that one?
I guess that doesn't sound too bad. What time does it start?
It starts at 8 PM.
Great. Would you like me to pick you up?
Yes, that would be lovely. Will you buy me popcorn at the film as well?
Of course, I would be happy to get you all the snacks that you like.
I love to have a snack during the movies. What about you?
I do as well! But I sometimes worry I might drop the snack if I get scared,
That is a funny worry to have. Will you hold my hand if I get scared?
I absolutely will. I am a gentleman.
Thank you! I can't wait for the film tonight.
