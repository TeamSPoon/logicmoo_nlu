What is your opinion of Pink Floyd?
I am not too familiar with them, so I really don't have an opinion.
I am sure you have heard some of their music.
What are some of the songs that I might know?
They perform "Another Brick in the Wall", "Comfortably Numb" and "Wish You Were Here".
I have heard of those, and I did really like them.
There are some other albums I am sure you would love.
What is your favorite album of theirs?
I really enjoy listening to the Division Bell, what of their last albums.
Who is their lead singer?
They have had a couple during their history.  Currently it is David Gilmour.
I am not sure I am familiar with him.
He was one of the founders, along with Roger Waters.  They had a falling out, and Roger Waters left the group.
Does David Gilmour have any solo albums?
Yes, he does, and I find them very enjoyable as well.  On an Island is a real gem.
How would you describe that one?
It has beautiful vocals, and extremely relaxing instrumentals.
So, it would be nice to have on in the background while hosting a party?
Most definitely, that would be one of my choices.
Thank you for all of the information.  I definitely have some music to listen too.
