I went to see Moana yesterday.
Really, how was it.
It was really good.
Better than Frozen?
No, not that good.
Who was your favorite character?
Moana because she was a strong and independent girl.
Sounds like a good role model.
She was, she stood up for herself and her beliefs.
Kids need to learn that today!
