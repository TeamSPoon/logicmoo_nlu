What's your favorite NFL team?
The Dallas Cowboys are my favorite.
That seems to be a common answer.
They are called America's team.
They are doing good now.
Yeah, they were bad for a while.
I like their running back.
Oh yeah, what's his name again?
His name is Ezekiel Elliott.
He's a very big and fast player.
They like giving him the ball alot.
If teams can't stop him, that's a good idea.
They have a good defense.
It's always good to not allow the other team to score much.
Some teams can't play any defense.
The Saints give up a ton of points a game,
They score a lot of points as well.
It doesn't matter because the other team scores more.
It's always a fun game to watch.
Yeah, I like high scoring games.
