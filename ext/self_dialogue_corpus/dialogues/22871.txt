What did you think of the new Baywatch?
I thought it was funny at first then surprised it was good.
Why did you think it was funny?
I think it was intended to be plus it had the rock in it.
He is a bit of a comedian.
Yeah he can be.
Overall though i think I give it an 8 for being nostalgic and different.
I do like how it was a little different yet stayed true to the oldies.
How do you think the rock performed?
I think he fit the role very well.
I thought he was a little out of place honestly.
I guess we have to agree to disagree there.
Why do you think he fit well though?
He fits the physique and the egotistical attitude.
That's a fair point.
Would you recommend the movie to people?
Yes but only if they have nostalgia for the oldies.
I think I would if you are open to something a bit different.
That's a good point I can agree with that.
I think I give ti a 3/5 stars too.
