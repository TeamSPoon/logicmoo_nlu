Did you know they started filming a sequel to Jurassic World back in February?
They did some filming in England and most recently in Hawaii.
I am really excited about seeing the sequel. I love the Jurassic movies.
Which one is your favorite?
I liked the very first Jurassic Park the best.
Although that movie was really good, I think I favor Jurassic World better.
I missed Jeff Goldblum's character.
He's going to be in the new sequel.
Really? It will be fun to see what his character does in the next movie.
I'm looking forward to seeing the trailer.
Is it out yet?
No but the rumor is it will debut at San Diego's Comiccon
I won't be going to that. Do you know when the movie comes out?
It's supposed to come out next June.
That seems like so long from now.
I know. I hope it's as good as the first Jurassic World.
in the original trilogy, I thought the first sequel was good, but not the second one.
I know. it seemed more like they just made the movie for the sake of making one and getting the money.
Hopefully that won't happen this time.
Guess we'll find out next June.
