Do you think the Atlanta Falcons will make it back to the Superbowl?
Not this year. They blew it last year.
They had the lead last year but let it go.
Didn't they lose in overtime?
Yes, the Patriots came back and beat them.
I would love to go to a Superbowl.
Tickets are nearly impossible to get.
They cost a fortune when you can find them.
Maybe someday I will see the Lombardi trophy hoisted in person.
Who is the trophy named after?
Vince Lombardi, one of the all time greats.
I knew that. I guess my mind blanked.
Where is the next Superbowl to be held?
It will be hosted at U.S. Bank stadium.
Who plays there?
That is the Vikings stadium.
I heard that is one of the loudest NFL stadium.
You bet! All those cheering fans.
It will be cold in Minnesota in February.
Heck of a place to hold the Superbowl. There might be snow.
