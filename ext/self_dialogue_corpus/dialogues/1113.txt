Yo J.D., did you by chance see the new Chargers stadium being built?
I didn't catch that one, are they still in San Diego?
You know I am a Titans fan, but our city finally has a stadium!
There is a stadium in Los Angeles, the Chargers are here now?
Yeah dude we have two teams, we run this sport!
Wow, the Rams are with us too?
It seems so man, the new stadium should be here by 2020.
We gotta head to a few games, I would love our team vs any top squads.
This means we have to get jerseys and pick a new favorite player!
Then so be it, we finally have a legitimate football team!
We also have a legitimate stadium and we don't have to resort to driving so far.
That is a big thing, I would watch more sports if I didn't have to drive two cities away.
I wonder if we have the budget to recruit any amazing players?
Los Angeles always good money, we may just have to wait for prospects.
I'm looking forward to smashing the AFC West when we get there.
It will definitely be a long road to the conferences and championship.
If the Chargers make it to the Superbowl I am going to go!
Those tickets will be thousands of dollars!
When else can we represent a football team without moving to another state?
You make a great point, let's do it!
