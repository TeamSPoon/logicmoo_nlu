I just saw Bram Stoker's Dracula.
Cool.  Who directed?
None other than Francis Ford Coppola.
Never saw it.  Who stars?
Gary Oldman, Winona Ryder, Keanu Reeves, and Anthony Hopkins.
Any good?
Yes, it was very close to the book.
Does Winona make it out alive?
Yes, she kills Dracula in the end!
Cool!  Yay for Winona!
