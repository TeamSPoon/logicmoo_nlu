What do you think about the Texas football teams
I think by far the cowboys are the best
Everyone would agree with that I think
The Texans lack key elements of their team
They have basically no quarterback
Yeah they had a chance to pick up a couple good free agents but they let it slip
I feel bad for them, but it ultimately came down to poor leadership
Yeah, I feel bad for those fans
Dak Prescott on the Cowboys is extremely good
Yeah, him and Ezekiel Elliot are both really good
I think they have a really good chance to go the distance next year
Yeah and I bet they will get close
They were eliminated by my favorite team, the Packers
That was a great game
Are you a packer fan too?
Yes I love the packers as well
Well then I hope the cowboys lose again to them next year.
I think we will have some luck in that
Although the cowboys are young, they may develop into a really great team
Only time will tell!
