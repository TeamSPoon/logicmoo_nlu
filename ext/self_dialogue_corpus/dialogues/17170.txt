Hey do you like any video game music?
Oh absolutely! I have a few game soundtracks that I listen to.
Oh yeah, what games?
I listen to league of legends champion themes.
Oh me too! What is your favorite one?
I would have to say without a doubt Jhin's theme is my favorite. What about yours?
I'd have to say Diana's theme is my favorite.
That is a nice choice. I think it's the only one with lyrics too.
Actually I think you're right. I think I like it so much because it sounds like a lullaby.
Yes it doest. Funny thing is the person who sung it was just an employee for the game.
Yeah, Actually she's done a few songs for the company.
I wonder if she got paid for singing them.
Come on man, of course she would of gotten paid for that.
Yeah but it's not in her job description to actually sing.
That's true I hope she got a bonus or something cause her voice was excellent.
Yes I agree.
What other songs did she sing?
She did Taliyah's theme as well, even though there where not lyrics she did the hymns.
Wow I had no idea.
Yup that lady is full of talent.
