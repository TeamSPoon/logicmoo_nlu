Have you seen The Arrival yet?
Yes! I saw it last weekend.
It was a trip wasn't it?
Yea, I'm still trying to figure out what happened.
Wanna hear my theory?
Absolutely!
I think as she lives through the present, her mind or consciousness basically time travels to other times in her life.
I think I'm still a little confused.
Ok, say it's 5pm and she's with the aliens, at 6pm, her consciousness is no longer there but in the future with her daughter. 7pm she's back.
Oh! So all of those moments where she seems lost in thought? That's where she goes in her mind?
Yea, almost like astral projection but through time, not just space.
That's very interesting! The guy who came up with that must be a genius!
I know, right? It kinda reminds me of Interstellar.
Man, I was so upset when that one alien died.
Yea my wife actually cried during that part.
Really? Mine did too!
It was really sad though.
I got chills during the part with the Chinese guy.
Yea I did too. It was a deep movie.
I think I need to see it again now after hearing your theory! It might make more sense to me.
