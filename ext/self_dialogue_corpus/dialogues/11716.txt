Do you know the Beatles have a channel on Sirius/XM now?
So it's lots of Beatles music?
That and similar artists.
Interesting. I might have to check it out.
It's channel 18.
Thanks. I'll see if I like it.
I'm surprised it took this long to make a channel for them.
So am I considering the other artists that got one before.
I always said they should have one.
I've said that before. They are so influencial.
