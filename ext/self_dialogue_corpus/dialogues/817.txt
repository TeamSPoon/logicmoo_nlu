Do you think Colin Kaepernick has a spot on an NFL roster?
I have no idea honestly.
He should not have gotten political.
A lot of people agreed at the time but now there is backlash.
Exactly he may not have a spot next season.
I am surprised the Browns don't want to take a chance on him.
Well they have Brock Osweiler now.
He is pretty good.
Yeah I am sure the Browns will win more the one game with him next season.
The way the Browns played they were lucky to win one game last season.
Good one they definitely didn't play very well.
The team they beat was probably embarrassed.
Yeah that doesn't help your standing.
Is Josh Gordon any good?
He got over 2,500 yards over the course of two seasons.
That is just amazing.
I know some plays would be happy getting 1,500 in two seasons.
I honestly hope the Browns are better next season
Me too that city deserves some success.
Yeah the Cavaliers couldn't bring home another trophy this yeae
