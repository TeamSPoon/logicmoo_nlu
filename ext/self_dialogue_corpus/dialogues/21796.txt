Are you into really freaky movies?
Well, it depends what kind of freaky you mean.
Well, like abstract kind of horror films.
I'm into most movies like that.
Have you by chance seen The Thing?
It doesn't ring a bell, who stars in it?
The main character is played by Kurt Russell.
I love him, hes always in crazy weird movies.
He definitely is.
So what is the movie The Thing about?
Well to start with, he is out in a winter terrain with a team of scientists in a remote building.
Sounds interesting so far. Go on.
Then they find some kind of remains of an alien species that was buried under the snow.
Wow, that's pretty cool.
Yeah but there is a catch to the story.
Okay, so whats the catch?
Well, the alien ends up being very hostile, and more like a parasite.
A parasite? Holy crap sounds nasty.
Yeah, it really is. It ends up 'consuming' people and taking their form to blend in.
That sounds really gross, I'd probably love watching the movie though.
