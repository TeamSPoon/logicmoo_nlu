I like the Hulk.
You mean in the Avengers?
Yes. He was so strong.
He took out so many aliens.
He gets stronger as he is angered more.
He was jumping all over New York.
Mark Ruffalo plays a great Bruce Banner.
I agree, he is smart and funny.
I like that he is lonely.
He cant let anyone close to him.
