What do you think are the Browns going to turn it around this year?
Man they are such a mess.  All those number picks and really not much too show.
It's hard to comprehend since the NFL has a salary cap that they can't put a better product on the field.
It really goes to show what a good front office in the NFL can achieve, or not.
Just look at teams like the Steelers and Patriots.
They seem to always be good and don't always have the best players.
Who is your favorite player?
I like Drew Brees from the Saints.
He is an amazing athleter and seems like a good guy.
No doubt. He is really under-sized too, but he plays with a lot of heart.
I've heard that he is pretty short.
He is, but his arm is incredible.
The Saints really like to pass a lot and are fun to watch.
Them and the Packers can really get after it on offense.
Yes Aaron Rodgers is a great QB.
He has some nice players on offense to pass too.
I like that he has good mobility too.
He doesn't run as much as he did when he was younger, but he still has some juice left in the tank to out run defensive linemen.
He was a great replacement for Favre.
I think so too and they let him learn from him before just inserting him into the lineup.
