Did you watch that movie The Space Between Us?
I finally did and I loved it!
I loved how they showed him seeing stuff for the first time.
Like how they showed him seeing horses-that was so real!
And rain!  He made me really appreciate things that I see more.
Did you think he was going to die?
I did for a bit.  I kindof already figured out that that guy was going to be his dad though.
Me too.  Tulsa was interesting.  She really cared about him.
They met online.  That made me wonder just who we interact with online!
I know what you mean.  Did you see how he acted with the ocean?
I thought that was really cool. i mean, if you think about it, there's no water at all on Mars.
Or trees for that matter.  I would have liked for them to show him reacting to more things on Earth.
I would have too.  I hope one day we get to put a colony on Mars like that.
I do too.  DId you notice at the end how that female astronaut took Tulsa in?
It looked like she was training her to go to Mars.
Do you think that the woman will go with Tulsa?
I like to think that she would.  She loved Gardner too.
It would be like having the whole family there!
I was surprised that his Dad went!
Yeah, but it made sense.
