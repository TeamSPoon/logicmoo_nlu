I love the Dixie Chicks, my husband is in the military and the traveling soldier song makes me cry every time.
That's a sad song, but so good.
It's well written.
I wish they would come out with more music too, I haven't heard anything from them in a while either.
I guess there is stood much new stuff for them to compete with.
Probably, but I like the older stuff.  I think it's better.
Me too, a lot of stuff these days is mainly about drugs and stuff like that.
I completely agree.
I miss the good music.
