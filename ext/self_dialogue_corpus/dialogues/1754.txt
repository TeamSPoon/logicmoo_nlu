It's getting closer to football season are you excited?
I'm more excited about this season than I have been for a long time.
Why are you so excited about this season?
Because my Cowboys look like they're ready to make a legitimate Superbowl run this year.
You sure last year wasn't a fluke.
I'm positive it wasn't.
What makes you so sure about that?
Because they have the most dominate line in the NFL for starters.
Well that offensive line can't hide their lack of talent on defense.
The defense was missing key players last year and still performed better than expected.
Well that's still not enough to convince me that they're Superbowl contenders.
The Cowboy offense was one of the best in the league last year with key players injured.
What key offensive players are you talking about?
Collins wasn't playing last year because of a toe injury and this year is the first year Dez Bryant is going into camp injury free.
Ok I'll give you that, but will that be enough to help their defense?
They are going to be a dominant defense this year just watch.
I can't see them having a dominant defense, they lost key players in the secondary.
They have replacements that were getting plenty of game time reps and they are better than the players that left, in my opinion.
Well I hope you're right.
Me too, I can't wait for the season to start
