I need some football!
Pretty soon, maybe three weeks.
We have to do it this year. Our team is getting kind of old.
We need a running game.
They did alright. He had like 1400 yards or so.
Seemed like less.
The recievers are the best ever. I hope they stay healthy.
They have some rule changes; I think there will be less holding now.
Right, the speed is there if they can get off the line.
Don't they play in the Thanksgiving game?
Yeah, national TV game. It will be great.
Just have to beat Detroit.
Should be doable. Road game though.
We finish up three out of four at home.
I heard you got tickets for the opener!
Wasn't me man. Not that lucky.
I haven't been to a game in a coon's age.
There's nothing like a live NFL game!
We should do it this year. Maybe the Tampa Bay game.
We will clean their clocks.
