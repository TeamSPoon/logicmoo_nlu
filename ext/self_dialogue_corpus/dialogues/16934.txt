What do you think of that new Adele Song?
You mean Hello?
Yeah, that one. It's pretty hot.
It's also pretty old. You just heard it?
I don't get to listen to the radio that much.
Yeah, I mean that song won a Grammy. Best song.
Wow. Awesome. So her stuff is pretty good?
How do you not know Adele? Yeah, she's good.
So I should check out her album?
Definitely. Her last one is called 25.
Sweet. Did it win any awards?
Definitely. She got record of the year for that one.
Really? She beat Beyonce?
You know Beyonce, but not Adele?
I'm weird. Is all her music so emotional?
Yeah, she's a pretty emotive singer.
You can feel it. She really puts her soul into it.
Yeah, it's what she's know for.
So 25? I'll check it out.
You can borrow my copy. Just ignore the tears.
