I'm kinda upset at how underrated Atlantis was.
It SUCH a  good movie!
The animation is so beautiful.
Yes, especially that scene where Kida is floating in the air towards the crystals.
I mean just the scenery in general and the style.
Honestly, like how gorgeous was that island when the lava dome broke away!
I miss Disney's hand-drawing animations, it makes me sad that it's all CGI now.
Atlantis had a bit of CGI but it worked with the style.
They just don't animate movies like that anymore.
I hear you.
