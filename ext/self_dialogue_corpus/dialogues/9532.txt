I really like Eminem, what do you think of him?
I think he has some good stuff and some bad stuff.
I think his earlier stuff is better in some ways. It's more raw.
His newer stuff is more polished, more technical.
I think he will always be one of rap's best wordsmiths.
He can definitely make things rhyme that shouldn't.
I think his early stuff has a lot of anger in it, but recently it's hard to make that relatable now.
You can't relate to a millionaire rapping about the system?
I think it had more presence when his raps were out of a genuine frustration with his lot in life.
Now he just kind of raps about annoying fans and the jealousy of other artists.
