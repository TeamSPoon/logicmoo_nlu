What do you think about the Star Wars: Rogue One Movie.
I found the film a good story and a really great use of technology?
What do you mean by real world?
I mean using body doubles and CGI to recreate characters such as Tarkin and young Leia.
That's interesting.    What about the story of the temple?
The temple is still kind of a mystery.    I am interested to learn about the crystals.
What is known about them from the other movies?
Khyber Crystals are known to power lightsabers and the Death Star.
Wow!     So there is no real explanation of how they relate to the Force?
No, we will have to wait to learn that information.
