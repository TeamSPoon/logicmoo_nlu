Did you ever see Star Man?
Refresh my memory? It sounds familiar but it eludes me at the moment.
Jeff Bridges plays an alien who comes to earth. Anything yet? I don't want to do a spoiler alert.
It's okay just tell me so I will see if I want to watch it .
Ok it has Karen Allen you know from Indiana Jones movies.
Yes I am starting to get a vague recollection of this movie.
Anyway Jeff Bridges plays  the alien that falls in love with an earthling.
Is that the one where he changes his appearance to look like her dead husband so as not to frighten her?
It seems like that is in there. It's been a while since I have seen it and I could be confusing that part that could be from another movie.
I think he searches her mind and chooses that image assuming that would be the good thing to do not considering it would scare the crap out of her.
Seriously! He should have looked into human psyche 101 or  Understanding Earthlings for Dummies.
John Carpenter did that movie in 1984
Yes the alien is answering  a "call" from Nasa and when he gets here of course they shoot down his craft.
Let me guess then they start trying to catch him.
But of course isn't that we humans do catch, kill and ask questions later
Yeah when there isn't anyone left to ask because you killed him!!
Anyway they are running from the government thugs to a rendezous point with his people to get back home.
Ah the old ET " phone home "play .
Exactly but it works for a low budget movie.
I think I will have to watch that....maybe.
