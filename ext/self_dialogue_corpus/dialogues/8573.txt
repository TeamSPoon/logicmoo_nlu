Who is your favorite female pop artist right now?
Hmm. I guess I would have to say Beyonce.
She's good. I like Rhianna better.
Her voice is cool. But Lemonade is great.
I like that Beyonce is trying to get everyone in formation.
For sure. Jay Z who?
I hate Miley Cyrus though.
Oh yeah, she's the worst.
I can't handle white artists right now.
Yeah. They all seem pretty tone deaf and clueless.
