What was the best casting done on STAR WARS?
James Earl Jones as the voice of Darth Vader. I think that was genius!
It does add so much to the film. His voice is so deep and the tone was perfect for the role.
Darth Vader is such a pivotal character, they had to make sure to get it right.
I heard he thought of Orson Wells for it.
No one compares to Jones for me.
Wells does also have that baritone voice.
Fine they have the same range but james is my pick still.
You and George! ... And me ,I am a huge fan as well!
Well I am glad we all can share the love of james earl jones.
