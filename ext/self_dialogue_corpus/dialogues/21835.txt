Did you ever watch fight club?
No I never saw it, but I know about it.
You should watch it.
Why is that?
The specific dialogue in the movie is taken from the book.
There was a book called Fight Club?
Yes, the writer is brilliant, and many of the quotes in the film are taken directly from the book.
Ok I have noticed many great films are also books.
There are themes of revolution in this movie.
What other themes and ideas are discussed.
Self improvement and fitting into modern society are topics that are broached as well.
It sounds like a deep movie.
It is that and so much more.
Is that why so many young guys like it?
It is a testosterone filled adventure also.
Yes I thought so.
But the movie is so much more than that.
It is all those things you described.
Yes it is quite complex and deep, a great story.
Ok thank you for tell me more about it.
