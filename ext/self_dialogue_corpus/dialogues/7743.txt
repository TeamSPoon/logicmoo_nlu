Why do you think the students started wearing more Muggle-like clothing in the Prisoner of Azkaban?
I know it was a deliberate choice of the new director, and I think they wanted to make the characters more relatable.
They definitely succeeded in doing that! My favorite part of the movie is when Hermione punches Draco in the face.
I love that part too. I have one huge question about the movie though.
What's that?
Why do they use a Time Turner to fix small mistakes, such as making sure that Buckbeak the Hippogriff doesn't get executed, but don't do it to prevent something like Harry's parents getting killed?
I really don't know. I've always kind of wondered that too. I think it might be because if they take too big of a risk with events, there's a bigger chance they'll get seen by themselves.
That does make sense. Plus, they probably wanted to make sure that the Prophecy involving the chosen one would still come true.
But couldn't Neville have been the chosen one, since he and Harry were born on the same day?
Hmm, that's true. And Neville's parents didn't die, they just got tortured by Bellatrix Lestrange.
