How many Taken movies were there?
Not sure. I know I only saw two, but don't know if they made a third.
I'll have to Google that and see.
Don't know if I'd watch another. They can only go so far with those movies.
That's true.
Liam Neeson is a fantastic actor though.
He is very believable.
Yes, he plays his parts great.
I wouldn't mess with him.
Me either.
