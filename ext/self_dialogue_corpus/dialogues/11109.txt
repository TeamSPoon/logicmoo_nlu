Did you see Taylor Swift's dress at the Grammy's?
Yes, she looked absolutely stunning.
I'm trying to remember the name of the designer but it has slipped my mind.
I think her name is Versace.
Right, yes, that's it!
She has such a great eye for fashion, doesn't she?
Yeah, the way she created the dress with big and bold blocks of color was so unique.
I agree, it's simple yet dramatic at the same time.
Yep, I love when designers play with color for their red carpet dresses like she does.
True, but Adele looked amazing too, and her's was just a long black dress.
Sometimes the simple classic styles can be the most beautiful, can't they?
Yes!  Although the complex beading on her dress made it much more unique and sophisticated than your average black dress.
True, but then you have people like Lady Gaga in her extremely bold Mark Jacob's outfit who really steal the show when it comes to fashion.
I must have missed that, what did it look like?
It was an almost electric blue dress, with a suit-like structure.
Oh, that's right, and she had on those huge crimson heels!
Yep, she definitely had the most unique outfit of anyone.
Lady Gaga is always wearing the most unique fashion of anyone!
I really can't argue with that!
Her fashion sense is just too bold to be contained.
