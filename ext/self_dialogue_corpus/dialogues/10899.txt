You've seen Fast & Furious movies right?
Yes, it's some of my favorite movies.
Do you remember when Roman Pierce was in a demolition derby?
Yes I do, why?
Well I was talking to a friend and wanted to settle something.
Alright, well ask away.
Did he bring his trailer to the derby and wasn't he also on house arrest?
Yes and yes, that's why he had to bring his home with him so he could race.
That's what I told my friend but he thought I was wrong.
Well your friend is wrong then.
