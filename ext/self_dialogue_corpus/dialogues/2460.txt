Go write one.
No. it's too much work. Soemone probably already did all this.
How do you know?
Otherwise, why would the NFL make all this data available?
Maybe they just like data.
No. It's a part of a tradition. thy've always kept meticulous track of their data. It's matter of someone putting things together
I'm willing to bet money Fantasy sports sites have all this worked out.
Probably. Otherwise, they have no other way to rank the price the players.
Take the run data for the rushers, and match up against the run defense?
Yep. That's how they determine the prices. Anway enough of metrics for the teams and players. How did we get into this anyway?
Passer ratings.
Oh yeah.. so yeah. passer rating is useful, but only for the passer.
The passer only passes.Football is more than just passing
Ugh, again. I'm not arguing.
You know what ESPN should do?
What?
Release their formula for QBR.
Well people wanted that for a while now.
I don't think they will do it
They're probably going to use it for their Fantasy games.
