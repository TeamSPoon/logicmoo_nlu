Have you ever seen the Kill Bill series?
It's my favorite Tarantino movies!
I rewatched them both last night.
I can never watch one and not the other.
They're just such a great movie franchise.
The fight scenes are incredible in the movie.
Even all the affects look so great.
I love the scene at the bar with Lucy Lu.
She was also awesome in those movies!
I always forget that is her in the scenes.
And Uma Thurman was in such great shape.
She had to work really hard to be in this movie.
I bet she trained like 8 hours a day for that.
No doubt about it.
I always love the scene of her eating rice.
It's so intense with her and pad mei!
I need to buy those movies.
I bet you could find them pretty cheap.
Yeah maybe I'll look later on tonight.
You should!
