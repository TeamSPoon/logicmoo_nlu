I think that Mulan had some of the best music I've ever heard in a movie.
Which song was your favorite?
The one that goes "I'll make a man out of you..."
That's a funny song. I like how Mulan makes all the guys look like whimps.
Yeah she's an awesome character.
Do you think Mulan was better than Mulan 2?
Oh absolutely.
Yeah. A lot of times the first movie is better than the second.
I don't know why they make sequels of some movies. They need to just leave them alone.
You're right. Like The Lion King; number one was way better than 2.
