So what are going to be the worst teams in the NFL this year?
I think the Bears will be a poor team.
Surely you can think of other bad teams!
Yes, I also think the Ravens will have a down year.
Why do you think that?
They haven't been great recently, and have a tough division in the AFC.
How do you think the 49ers will do?
I think that they will have a rough season.
Why do you think that?
Ever since Harbaugh left, they have been in shambles.
What do you think about their recently retired players??
A shame, but I can understand why it happened.
Yeah, football is a brutal sport, especially in the NFL.
This is true, as brain injuries seem to be the focus now.
And rightfully so! We have a long way to go.
Hopefully NFL head gear and awareness will keep increasing.
So who are your picks for the super bowl?
I think Seattle and New England will be there again.
Good choices, but almost too typical.
Yes, that would be almost too easy of a road in the NFL.
