I saw where a new Aladdin should be coming to theater soon.
That was my favortie Disney movie growing up, so I hope it's true.
Well I read that the true date hasn't been announced, but summer of 2018 is time period.
Well I'm so excited. I just love the storyof Aladdin and Jasmine.
I wonder who they will get to play the Genie since the great Robin Williams is no longer with us.
I don't know! It will be different without him, but I'm sure they have a great plan.
It would be nice if they kept most of the same old cast. It would really help it feel like the original.
Oh yes, it really never is the same when they replace the whole cast. Well as long as they keep with the fantastic effects, it should be a hit.
I just hope they keep with the action and romance so it'll be fun for the whole family.
Disney always had great sequels, so I can't wait to see this in theaters soon.
