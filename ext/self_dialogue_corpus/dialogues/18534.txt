What music are you listening to these days?
I've been listening to a lot of Neil Young lately.
Oh, like recent Neil Young or like Neil Young and Crazy Horse.
Both! I found Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere in my room the other day.
Nice! That's one of my favorite albums. I love Down By The River.
I love the harmonies in Cinnamon Girl. I love blasting that song when I drive.
Yeah that's a rocker. What do you think of his more recent albums?
I think the last one I heard about was Prairie Wind about 10 years ago.
Did you see Jonathan Demme's documentary on him? Emmylou Harris was singing back up, I think.
I love Emmylou Harris! Her, Linda Rondstandt, and Dolly Parton made a really great album called Trio together.
I need to check that out. Did you hear the album with Emmylou and Mark Knopfler.
Yeah, All the Roadrunning?
Yes! That's a beautiful album.
What have you been listening to?
I guess some old stuff too. But like stuff from the 2000s, like the Clientele.
Oh, Suburban Light is a masterpiece.
Yeah I started to listen to some of their stuff again because they have a new album coming out in Sept.
Wow, really? Have you heard any new songs on it?
Yeah, they released a really beautiful one called Lunar Days. It's classic Clientele.
I'm going to have to check it out. I really liked Bonfires on the Heath.
