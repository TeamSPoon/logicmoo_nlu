Hi there, I need some dance music ideas, what kind of dance songs do you like?
My music tastes are a little eclectic.  What do you need these for?
Planning some dance songs for a small party at my house.  Nothing over the top.
Got it.  How about a little Michael Jackson.
A little retro but I like it.  Get people up and dancing to Thriller.
Right.  Then something modern like Adele's Rumor Has It.
I find her a little dramatic.  Could work though.
Alright, so maybe one Adele song - let's keep it mixed.  What about David Bowie's Lets Dance?
Yeah.  Can't go wrong with Bowie.
No you really can't.
Hey Kylie Minogue is great.
Yeah she does a lot of dance music.
Anything fun for the party!
And then...turn things on its head.
How?
Do a little rock-abilly for example, its so great to dance to.  Stray Cat Strut, or Queen's Crazy Little Thing Called Love.
I'll check it out.
And also the original material girl -one of Madonna's songs. Maybe Vogue!
Absolutely!  Any one else?
Can't leave ouut Lady Gaga!  Maybe Bad Romance.
