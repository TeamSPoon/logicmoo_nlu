Do you remember Disney's The Black Cauldron?
Yes. That movie really scared me when I was little.
It was a bit dark for a Disney movie.
I remember hearing they squished pasta to make the sound effects for the living dead army.
Really? I had not heard that.
That was the only part that freaked me out as a kid. The rest was ok though.
Even the part where Gurgi sacrifices himself?
I'd forgotten that part.
Didn't the witches say they could not save him, but they did?
I think so. I wonder why they said that?
