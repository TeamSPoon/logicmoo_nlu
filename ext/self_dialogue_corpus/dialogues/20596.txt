Have you seen the movie Doubt?
I am not sure who is in it?
It stars Meryl Streep, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Amy Adams, and Viola Davis.
Wow what a great cast. I still can't remember though. What happens?
It stars Meryl Streep and Amy Adams as nuns. Philip Seymour Hoffman plays a new priest Father Flynn.
I think I may have seen that. Desn't Meryl Streep not like Father Flynn because she thinks he is too nice?
Ya then she thinks he possibly sexually assualted one of the boys, but you never find out if that is true or not.
Yes that's right. I remember thinking he hadn't done anything wrong, and Meryll Streep just didn't like how liberal he was compared to her.
I think you are probably right. I kind of thought the same thing.
Ya like when she mentioned his finger nails not being cut enough
Yes and how he was talking about laughing with the boys.
Wasn't that movie supposed to have been set a long time ago?
Not that long ago I want to say like in the sixties.
Oh, maybe I will have to watch that one again to remember.
My favorite part is the end dialogue where Meryl Streep says she has doubt.
Oh I remember that part!
Ya and then there is also another part I didn't realize at first but the boy is the first black student accepted.
Oh that's interesting, so I wonder if Meryl Streep didn't like that either?
Hmm.. I'm not sure I don't remember it really being mentioned.
It could have been there though.
