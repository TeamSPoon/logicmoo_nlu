What is your favorite thriller movie so far this year?
I would have to say 'Get Out'.
Why did you choose that movie?
I liked this movie because there was action, but it also made you think alot.
I agree with that, this movie had a lot of background story in it.
I agree, it is close to being a non-fictional story.
There was so much buzz about this on social media.
It is amazing how they were about to fit all of the facts into the movie.
I was simply amazing by the acting, it was amazing.
I agree, this was one of the better acted movies this year.
