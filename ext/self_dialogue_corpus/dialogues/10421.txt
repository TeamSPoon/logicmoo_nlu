I really enjoy Bruce Willis movies, what about you?
Yes me to. I think he is one of the best.
I could watch the Die Hard movies over and over again. They never get old!
I really enjoyed part two. I think it was my favorite out of the whole series.
That one was really good, but I would go with Live Free or Die Hard.
Speaking of the Die Hard movies, they may be the best action franchise of all time.
I don't know, the Lethal Weapon series is up there for me.
Yeah, Mel Gibson and Danny Glover were a great combination in my opinion.
Comparing Lethal Weapon and Die Hard is very difficult but I would give Lethal Weapon a slight edge.
I think I would go with the Die Hard series just because Bruce Willis is one of my favorite actors.
I can understand that, either way they are both great franchises.
Are there any more action movies that can compete with either of those?
I don't think so, although Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger may have something to say about that.
That is true. The both of them have put out some legendary action films.
In terms of Arnold, the Terminator films were fantastic.
I agree, but I think Kindergarten Cop is one of my all time favorite films.
Have you seen the sequel with Dolph Lundgren?
Yes but it was not the same at all!
I know, I wish Arnold would have came back and renewed his role as John Kimble.
Yes, that would have been awesome. It would have made a lot more money at the box office if he had of.
