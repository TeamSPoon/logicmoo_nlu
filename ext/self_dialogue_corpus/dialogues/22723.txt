So, you ever seen the movie Cemetery Man?
Uh... maybe, that sounds kind of familiar... guessing it's a zombie film?
Yeah, sorta... it's got zombies in it, but that's only part of the plot.
Well, refresh my memory.
Okay, it's it Rupert Everett as a guy who runs a cemetery and a few days after a body's buried they come back to life as a "Returner" so he shoots them are re-buries them.
Oh, wait, I think I remember that.. and he's got this really obese assistant or something?
Yeah, that's Nagi.
And there's this girl that keeps appearing over and over again?
Yeah, that's the movie!
Yeah, that was kind of a bizarre.. not sure I really understood parts of it.
Well, I have a theory about it.
Ahhh... bet you do.
Hehe!  Seriously though, my theory is that both him and Nagi are dead and stuck in some sort of purgatory.  For the Dellamorte he's probably there because he loved but killed that girl, so she keeps showing up to torment him.
Hmm.. that's sounds interesting.  Like I said, it's been awhile since I've seen the movie, so I can't really argue one way or another.
Well, it's one of my top 50 or so favs, I rewatch it about once a year.
Yeah, having no social life sure is nice, huh?
Ow, ow.. .that's hurts.
I'm sorry, that was a bit of a low blow.  Forgive me, bro.
Ahhh.. I can't really argue with it.  I do watch too much TV sometimes.  I just relate more to fictional people I guess.
Well, it's not that uncommon, so I'm told anyway.
