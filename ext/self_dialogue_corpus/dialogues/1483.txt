Some people think that Tom Brady is too old to play football.  I think he is a bundle of energy.
How old is he?  Isn't he almost forty?
He is 39.
I know you are his fan.  Good luck to you.
Aren't you a Seahawks' fan?
So-so.  My brother is the real fan in our family and I support him.
I heard that The Seattle Seahawks has just signed a quarterback.
Yes, I think so.  I have not had time following footballs lately.
The new guy's name is Austin Davis.
You more much more about Seahawks than I do even though you are a Patriots' fan.
I like football in general.  I enjoy college football too.
To tell you the truth, I enjoy college football games more than NFL.
Why is that?
Because it is not about money.  Professional football players might not be loyal to their team.
I agree.  They might move to a different team if they got a better offer financially.
That is exactly what I think.
I am going to go to a sports bar for the game.  Let me know if you would like to join me.
I would love to.
Okay.  I will email you the address.
Thank you.  Talk to you later.
