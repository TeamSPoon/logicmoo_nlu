If you were stuck on a desert island with a stereo and only one music album to listen to, what would it be?
Would I get unlimited batteries for the stereo?
Let's say yes. You can listen all you want, but only to one album.
Then I'd take Kanye West's College Dropout.
That's a really good pop album. But I'm not sure it's the best choice here.
Why do you say that?
I'm not sure it's rich enough musically.
The songs have pretty disparate sounds to them. Think about 'Slow Jams' vs. 'Jesus Walks'.
Oh, I agree there's some variation. But in the end, it's all the same kinds of Soul beats.
OK, if Kanye isn't the best pick, what would you take?
I'd take Animals, by Pink Floyd.
Yuck, no thanks. 20 minute guitar solos and weird lyrics about sadness.
I could mischaracterize Kanye's music simiarly. Cmon, admit that Pink Floyd is good.
Pink Floyd made good music that I have no interest in listening to.
Your loss. You want to talk about complex music, talk about Pink Floyd.
Boring and sad, though. If I'm stuck on a desert island, I need something with more pep to it.
Eh, I think you'd be better off with some ruminative, deep music to get lost within.
Kanye explores some fairly deep concepts on College Dropout.
Deep is a relative term, then, I guess.
You might want to give College Dropout another try.
