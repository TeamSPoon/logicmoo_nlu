Who is the most beautiful disney princess to you?
In terms of spirit snow white, she was gentle and loving. You?
I am torn so many good ones. Maybe jasmine.
I liked how feisty she was. Also her outfit was pretty great.
Ya, disney does a great job creating great iconic looks.
Don't forget characters too. I think they have come a long way in developing characters.
Yes even though I love snow white also.. Jasmine for example is far more developed in personality and depth.
I think that could be said of most of their work, as time goes one it grows deeper in character development.
Yes true , characters are more complex now, take frozen people are not always just the obvious bad guy.
True more twists also or surprises than in disney's original  animated films like snow white.
