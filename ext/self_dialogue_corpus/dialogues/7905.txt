Have you heard the song by Rag'n'Bone man called Skin?
I dont recognize it.
It is a sweet song that is emotional.
I like the sound of that.
He talks about love and people, it is powerful.
That sounds meaningful and special.
Yes it is emotionally gripping and powerful.
That sounds like a powerful song.
Yes he sings a great tune.
Ok thank you for telling me.
