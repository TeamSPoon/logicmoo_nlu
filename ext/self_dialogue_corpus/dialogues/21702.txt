what was the most shaping 80s movie you saw when younger?
Probably Breakfast club.
John Hughes was the king of 80s films.
Well he essentially created the brat pack.
We also have Ferris Bueller's Day Off, thanks to him.
Both were such coming of age stories.
I love both. Also pretty in pink, sixteen candles.
All classics, what about non hughes 8o's films?
I used to watch Risky Buissness a lot.
That one is a lot more adult in theme.
It is and isn't still coming of age and focus on a teen.
True but recall the subway sex scene?
Yes, I loved that scene. Really liked the song during that scene as well.
What song?I don't recall it,
Tangerine Dream - Love on a real train. It added so much atmosphere.
I still don't remember it. I do recall Rebecca De Mornay.
Yes she was great as the role of Lana.
I doubt many hookers look like her in real life.
She was more of a high end one. I think. You are probably right though.
Either way a memorable cast and movie.
