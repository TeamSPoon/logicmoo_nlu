Did you see lady gaga's performance of million reasons on the american music awards?
I must have missed it, how was it?
It was amazing, she sang it beautifully and was sitting on a stool with a guitar in the grass, the effects were equally as amazing!
Wow, that really does sound amazing. I love hearing her sing live.
Me too! I love watching her acapella videos.
I agree! I have seen so many online. Her voice is really powerful and she has amazing vocals.
Did you see that video of her singing born this way acapella to a young boy?
I did, she was spectacular! I wish I was that little boy that she was singing too.
We should go to a lady gaga concert together one day!
Yes! I hear there is one coming up in August!
