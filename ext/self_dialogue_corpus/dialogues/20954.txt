What's your favorite child's movie?
I love The Iron Giant! I cried when I watched it for the first time.
Is that the movie about delivering drugs to Alaska on sled?
I don't think so. It's about an iron giant.
What does he do?
He befriends a boy.
Anything else?
I'm not sure. It's been a while since I saw it.
Was it published by Warner Brothers?
Yes, I believe it was. It was apparently based on a book.
I haven't read the book.
The movie is amazing. It was Brad Bird's directorial debut.
What medium did you see it in?
I saw it on VHS with my parents.
That must have been perfect.
I believe it was. It was a great time.
Do you think you'll watch it again?
I might. Maybe sometime in the future.
Do you want to watch it together?
I'm really busy this week, sorry.
