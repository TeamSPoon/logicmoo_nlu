So, I'm thinking of doing a movie sequel trivia night, and I was wondering if I could run some of the questions by you?
Of course!
Okay, so, in Weekend at Bernie's II, what special power does Bernie's corpse have?
I don't know that one.
It dances whenever music plays.
That's incredible. Are there others?
In Ocean's Eleven Two, what unique ability does Julia Roberts' character have?
She looks just like Julia Roberts.
Correct!
I'm glad I got at least one of them.
They're supposed to be hard.
Good trivia questions usually are.
Okay, in Home Alone II, how does Macauly Culkin end up home alone again?
I don't remember. It's been ages.
He gets on the wrong plane.
Seriously?
It's totally believable too.
I don't know about that. Any more?
Last one, but it's a joke: What subtitle should "Now You See Me II" have had.
That's subjective!
