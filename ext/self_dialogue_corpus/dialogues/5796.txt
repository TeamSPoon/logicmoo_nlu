I have loved Disney movies all my life.  I think my favorite is Tangled.
Why do you like that on, in particular?
I don't know for sure.  It makes me laugh, and the songs are awesome.
That's true.  Isn't the mother who keeps Rapunzel in the tower absolutely awesome?
She really is.  She had me scared even though she was animated.
My favorite part is when Rapunzel is singing in the bar.  All those bar guys are hilarious!
I like that part too, but I especially love the ending when she founds out who she really is.
That is really neat.  What about the part with all those lanterns?
I totally forgot about those.  They are magical and perfectly Disney.
Disney really has a way of getting to my heart.
