Hey, do you ever listen to band from the 70s and 80s?
Yes, I really enjoy that kind of music, especially the classic rock.
Me too! That's my favorite genre during that time.
One of mine too, but I enjoy disco too! What are some of your favorite bands?
Well, Journey is one of my favorite bands in that time, but really it is just one of my favorite bands.
Absolutely! They have some of the best music, and they have many songs that topped the charts.
Yes, and I know I hear them being used pretty often in movies. I don't even think they made a song that wasn't good.
I think your're right. They are the kinds of songs that so many age groups enjoy.
True, my daughter is one of them, and she is only 13. By the way, her name is Journey!
Really? Did you name her after the band?
Ha, no, it was just a coincidence. But, she likes that her name is the same as the band.
I bet people ask her about it all the time, if she was named after the band.
They do! She doesn't mind. What's your favorite song?
I would have to say, 'Faithfully". What about you?
I would have to go with "Don't stop Believing". It's so great!
It is, but so is "Wheel in the Sky". So many great songs from them.
I know, even 20 plus years later.
True! I think they will always be popular.
No doubt, they will be heard and remembered for years.
I agree!
