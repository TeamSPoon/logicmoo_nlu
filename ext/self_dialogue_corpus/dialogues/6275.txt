We just saw the new Cars movie the other night, Cars 3. It was really good.
I love the Cars movies. Cars 2 wasn't as good as the first, but I was pretty excited about this third one.
Yeah, Cars 2 seemed more like it was about Mater than anything, but it was still fun.
Mater is a great character, but my kids' favorite is Lightning McQueen.
I think they'd really enjoy the new movie then. I'm sure you will too.
Well, Nathan Fillion is one of my favorite actors, so I'm looking forward to hearing him put one of the characters to life in only the way he could.
I know he's been in a lot of shows, but wasn't there some big movie he was supposed to make an appearance in recently?
He filmed a scene for Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, but it was cut.
I remember you telling me about that. Man, speaking of great movies...
Definitely! Only movie I've seen more than once in the theater.
