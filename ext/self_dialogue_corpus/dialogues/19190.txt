What type of music should I play at our dinner party?
Who all will be there?
My parents, my fiancé's parents, my fiancé, and myself.
Do you know what kind of music his parents like?
I believe the both like country.
You should play country then.
Well I thought about it, but my mother and my fiancé don't like country.
What does your mother and your fiancé like?
They both like rock.
Well then you should make a mix.
That's a great idea.
Which artists should I choose?
I would play Tom Petty, Rod Stewart, Whitesnake, Bryan Adams, bands like that for the rock.
That is a good idea, easy rock should be a good compromise for everyone.
Yes, and for the country I would play some Tim McGraw, Garth Brooks, Faith Hill the more popular ones.
Yes, that will benefit everyone.
I think so.
What should I play first country or rock?
I would mix up the 2, put a country song on followed by a rock song and so on.
That is perfect. Thank you so much.
