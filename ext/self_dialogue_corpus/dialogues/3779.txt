I have a good thriller for you. What Ever Happened To Baby Jane.
Wow,that was great.
Two icons,Bette Davis and Joan Crawford.
They were enemies too.
Yes they were.
Anne Bancroft actually won for Best Actress.
Yes,Joan Crawford campaigned for her to get it.
Right,she wanted anybody but Bette Davis to win.
That exactly what happened too.
Yes it did.
