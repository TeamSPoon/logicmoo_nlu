Did you like the Beatles rubber soul album.
Loved it. I thought it started the Beatles on their way to deeper meaning songs and started their evolution to rock,artists.
Yes,I agree.
It's a classic and starts showing John and Paul's individual talents.
It was released in 1965 right?
Yes it was.
Some personal stuff like johns Girl and Norwegian wood.
I didn't know Norwegian wood was the wood John was burning in a girls fireplace when they were in Norway.
I know,still learning things about the Beatles I never knew before
It's like it's never going to stop
