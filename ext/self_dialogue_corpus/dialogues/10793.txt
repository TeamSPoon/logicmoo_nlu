Do you know how to drift a car?
Are you asking for a friend?
Well, I mean, I saw this new fast and the furious movie and now I want to try it.
You are going to wreck yourself.
But vin diesel makes it look so easy!
Movies aren't reality man, let it go.
How hard can it be?
Is this really the person you want to be, copying movies?
Cars are cool.
You need help.
