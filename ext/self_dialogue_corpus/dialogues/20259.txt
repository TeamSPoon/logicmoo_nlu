I just watched Fast and Furious 8, it was awesome.
I been wanting to see it, is it any good?
Definately! The cars as always are slammin', but they took a different plot twist.
I figured they would have to do something different without Paul Walker.
They did, but they still tied him into the plot in a couple ways so it was nice tribute.
So how was the plot different?
Dom turns against his team.
No way! The family is everything to him; he preaches about it thru 7 movies!
He and Letty are in Cuba on their honeymoon and while walking back from getting coffee, he stops to help this chic that turns out to be Sypher.
Wait, I thought Sypher wasa  thing not a person.
Me too! But come to find out it isn't. She shows him something on a phone and he just freaks.
It would have to be something huge.
Your remember that chic he was with before Leddy got her memory back.
Yeah, but so what, she was so minor.
Well apparently there is a minor involved.
No way! Dom has a kid?
Yep, and he is being held hostage by Sypher, along with the mother.
Why didnt he just take his team and do whatever she wanted?
She wanted him to go against his team, he even took the Rock out and framed him to go to prison with Statham.
I guess I am gonna have to go check it out.
