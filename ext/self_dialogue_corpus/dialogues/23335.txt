Have you ever seen the movie on Netflix called Clown?
I have not even heard of that.
It is pretty good actually.
What is it about? Clowns?
It is about a man who put on a clown costume, then it takes over him.
What do you mean?
I mean he literally can't take it off!
That is odd.
It starts to turn him into a demon.
A demon? How so?
The costume is haunted or linked to a bad past.
Is it a scary movie?
It is kind of scary/action.
I will have to look it up. Any well known actors?
I did not recognize them, but you may.
Is it worth watching though
Yes it is, I can't say too much without giving it away.
I will look it up on Netflix.
There are a lot of good movies on there.
Yes, I have seen quite a few!
