Who is your favorite NFL player?
That is a hard choice! I don't really have a favorite player, but I love the Browns.
Oh, you must be a die hard fan! How are they looking for next year?
Well we have a couple of players who seem potentially promising.
Oh, who are they?
Myles Garrett, Jabrill Peppers, and David Njoku are the ones most people are talking about.
Oh, interesting. Who is the quarterback?
DeShone Kizer for now. He is actually from Ohio.
Oh, where in Ohio is he from?
He grew up in Toledo and was really good in high school.
Oh nice, I didn't know that. Where did he play in college.
He played at Notre Dame. Hopefully he will bring us victory!
I hope that he does too! I am more of a Jets fan.
Oh no! They are also a tough team to be a fan of.
Definitely, last year was really rough.
Yeah, wasn't last year really hard for them?
Very bad, we were 5-11 in 2016. But we were 6-10 is 2015 so I'm not sure what really happened.
That is rough. Who are your best players?
Christian Hackenberg and Bryce Petty are the quarterbacks for now. I'm hoping to make it to a game this year.
I'd like to go to a Browns game as well.
