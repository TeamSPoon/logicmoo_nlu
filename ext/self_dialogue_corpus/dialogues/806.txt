Do you think New York has a chance this year?
The Giants?  I don't really see much happening for them?
Why not?
This organization seems stuck in a rut with the same culture.
Yes, they don't seem to change a lot.
That might be a good thing clubs that keep changing a lot do not seem to go far.
The giants do have quite a few Super Bowl championships.
The formula is consistency.
Yes, but it seems like they are in a rut most of the time.
Then all of the sudden they make an unexpected run and take it all.
Eli Manning needs a good team around him.
He is getting older now and he was always inconsistent.
If you pressure him he is like a deer in the headlights.
But if he has the team around him he can do well.
He's been playing a lot longer then I would have thought.
I thought he was an average player.
The giants have stuck with him and given him loads of money.
All their money is in a few players.
I think that is what is keeping them mediocre.
You need a team not all the money in a mediocre aging quarterback.
