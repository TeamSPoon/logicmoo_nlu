My daughter's having a Disney princess party, and I'm trying to decide which movie we should watch.
Does she have a favourite?
Well, she loves Frozen but honestly I might tear my hair out if I hear "Let it Go" one more time!
True true! Well there are lots of other Disney movies, what about Beauty and the Beast?
The one with Belle? Oh, that one is so sweet!
And if you're tired of animation, you could even get them to watch the new live action one instead.
Isn't that the one that Emma Watson starred in?
Yep! It came out a few months ago.
I never got to see that one, that might be a good option.
It's very similar to the animated one, I think you'll enjoy it.
