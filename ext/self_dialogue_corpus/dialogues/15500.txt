Do you listen to country music much?
Not too much. Do you?
I have really started to get into it.
What got you to be interested in listening to country?
Well, I have watched The Voice and always thought Blake Shelton was funny so I listened to a few of his songs and liked them.
He is a funny guy. I have never really listened to his music though. What songs did you listen to?
The first song I found was "Austin". It is one of his older ones, but I really enjoyed it.
i may have to try it out. Any other suggestions of his?
I think he has some funny songs that are more recent. Try "Honey Bee" and "She's Got a Way With Words".
I will give them a listen. So have you branched out to other country artists?
I have a little. I have found that I really like groups.
What country groups are there?
I really like this group called Little Big Town.
I have heard a few of their songs actually. I liked them.
I really liked the harmonies that they do.
Oh yes, I remember them being beautiful.
Another group I have gotten into is Lady Antebellum.
I have not heard of them. Do they do any songs I would know?
"Need You Now" is a pretty popular one.
I have never heard of that, but maybe I will try to listen to that one too.
