You know what I saw the other day?
What?
The Disney movie, The Little Mermaid!
Oh my gosh, I remember that movie!  Ariel was a great Mermaid princess.
I know.  She had such a beautiful voice, too.
Yeah, she really did.  The pelican was hilarious, too.
I know, and I loved watching her try to brush her hair with a fork.
Yeah, it truly had some great parts.  What about the lobster?
Oh yeah, the lobster was great!
He cracked me up.  I love that movie.
