Do you have a favorite director?
Yes, well, a favorite pair of directors.
What does that mean?
I'm a huge fan of a set of brothers.
What brothers?
The Coen Brothers. Joel and Ethan Coen.
Do they direct together?
Yes, they direct and produce.
What movies have they done? Their names sound slightly familiar.
Oh jeeze, they have a giant body of work. Raising Arizona, The Big Lebowski, No Country for Old Men, Barton Fink, Burn After Reading, Inside Llewyn Davis, I could go on and on and on.
Oh, I know them! I've seen No Country For Old Men.
Did you like it?
It was disturbing. Highly disturbing.
Yes, it is an extremely disturbing movie. The killer, Chigurgh is a madman and a nihlist.
Yes, that guy was super scary. He flipped a coin to see if people would live.
Yeah, I find that sometimes people have difficulty saying they love a movie with such a disturbing villain.
What's your takeaway from it then?
That in facing real nihilism, those with recognizable emotional responses and dispositions are at a big disadvantage.
So it's a message movie in your opinion?
Yeah, I'd say so. It also has some of the best cinematography of all time.
