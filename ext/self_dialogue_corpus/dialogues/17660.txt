Have you heard of The Walls Group?
No, I haven't. Who are they?
They are a young group of family members who have great talent.
What kind of music do they perform?
It's gospel but it has a modern spin on it.
Modern like how?
They have a song they perform with Kirk Franklin called Perfect People.
What's so modern about that?
The lyrics talk about how no one is perfect and that you don't have to be perfect to be loved.
That's not really modern. People have been making music about not being perfect for ages.
True but their video is shot in a gym with a basketball game and young people.
Sounds like a typical music video to me.
Maybe you have to watch it to get a better idea.
Maybe so. What else is good to know about them?
They definitely perform some great harmony on their slower songs if you like slow songs.
I do like slow songs but not that old fashioned out of the hymn book type slow.
I agree, I need something more modern. That's why I like The Walls Group.
Do they motivate you?
I would say yes. Sometimes they give me great motivation to get through the day. You should check them out.
Thanks, I think I will.
