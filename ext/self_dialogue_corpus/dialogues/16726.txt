Have you heard Carly Rae Jepsen's new song yet?
No, I didn't know she still did music.. what's it called?
"Cut to the Feeling". It's a bop!
I'll give it a listen.
So, what did you think?
Wow, I really liked it! That was definitely a bop, you're right.
She put out an amazing album two years ago that basically kicked off the current 80s revival trend in pop music.
Oh really? What's the album called?
EMOTION. It was very highly critically acclaimed.
Then why haven't I heard about it?
I think people overlooked her because of how annoying "Call Me Maybe" got.
That song did get pretty annoying after awhile.
True, but some of the lyrics of that song are actually good.
Like what?
"Before you came into my life, I missed you so bad."
When you put it like that, it is a really cute line.
Yeah, she's great at writing love songs and pop.
Does she have anything coming out soon?
She's recorded over 50 songs for her next album which is said to have a 70s sound to it. It'll probably be out later this year.
I can't wait!
