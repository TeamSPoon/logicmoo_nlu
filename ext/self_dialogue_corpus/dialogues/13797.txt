You know what is sad
What is sad?
That Lady Gaga has so many unappreciated songs
What ever do you mean
Well i mean her most popular ones are not her best
Is that not true for every artist
Not really i see many who have good work popular
But it is not a bad thing in itself
Why not
because it means its nuanced
