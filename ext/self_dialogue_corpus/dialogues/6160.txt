What did you think about Simba's voice actor from The Lion King?
I think Matthew Broderick voiced him really well. Ditto for Jeremy Irons and Scar.
Yeah, Scar was a really great character. Disney made him a great villain.
What's your favorite The Lion King song?
Hmm. I think either "Be Prepared", or "I Just Can't Wait To Be King".
Yes, that's a really tough decision. But I really liked "Hakuna Matata".
Yeah, that's a really upbeat and happy song.
I agree. I rate The Lion King 5 stars out of 5!
Me too!
It's my favorite Disney movie.
