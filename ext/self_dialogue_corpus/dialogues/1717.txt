I wish it was September already.
I know! I miss the NFL.
It's weird on Sundays without football.
Very true, I find it hard to occupy my time.
Who is your favorite team?
I like the Giants.
Do you think Eli is over the hill?
Eh, he's close but he's got plenty of weapons this year.
Very true. I really like the addition of Brandon Marshall.
Add in OBJ and they have a lot of weapons.
Eagles defense will be tough though.
True, but I don't know if there offense can keep up the pace.
Yeah, but you gotta think that the offense will take a step forward this year.
I'm honestly not so sure.
Well, the Cowboys are definitely the favorite.
They deserve to be the preseason favorite, but there are questions.
Like what?
Whether Dax Prescott can take a further step this year.
He looked good last year.
But that was last year and he is still young and facing a lot of pressure.
