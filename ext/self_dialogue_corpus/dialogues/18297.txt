What instrument do you think is the hardest to play?
Probably the guitar
I think it would be the drums
No way
Why?
Because you can learn those easily
I do not think so
A guitar is a much more precise instrument
They are both pretty tough
Do you play either one?
I play the drums
Is it hard?
It came pretty naturally
I see
What about you?

We should form a band
Are you any good?
Yes, I think so and you?
