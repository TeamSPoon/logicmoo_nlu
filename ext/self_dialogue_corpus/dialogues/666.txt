Hey, will you be watching and NFL games this season?
Yeah, you know it. Who do you think is going to the superbowl this year?
I think Pittsburgh steelers have a good chance.
They sure do, they have a good team, and I like them.
Who do you think is the best player on the team?
There is a couple; Antiono Brown and Le'Veon Bell, just to mention.
Yes, and don't forget their great quarterback, Benjamin Roethlisberger.
Big Ben, knows how to make much needed plays happen.
I know right. He is a good quarterback.
Didn't he play in 3 superbowls?
I believe so, and think the last one was in 2010.
Hey do you remember that touchdown pass to Santonio Holmes against the Cardinals, that helped them win?
Yeah, many think that the call was wrong and the Cardinals should have one.
Well, they did review the play and confirmed it was a catch.
Yes they did. Oh, let's not forget Antonio Browns' one handed catch during the colts game last season.
Right. that boy can play.
I think he will have a long career with the Steelers. What about you?
As long as he does not get seriously injured.
I only know of one time that he missed a game in the pass 4 season.
That was for a concussion.
