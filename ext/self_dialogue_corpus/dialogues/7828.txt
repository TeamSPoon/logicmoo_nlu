How powerful do you think Dumbledore really is?
Well, they've said a bunch of times in the movies that he's the most powerful wizard ever.
Yeah, but it doesn't seem like he does all that much.
What do you mean? He's done a bunch.
Maybe in the last few movies, but in the first few he seemed useless.
Well, true but I think that's because the first few movies were meant more for little kids.
That doesn't make sense though.
Agreed, but it's kinda how it is. The later movies got darker and he got more powerful.
Yeah, I agree. From the Voldemort/Dumbledore battle in Goblet of Fire it seems like his power ramped up exponentially.
That's my point, yeah till then he hadn't done much, after that he was unstoppable.
