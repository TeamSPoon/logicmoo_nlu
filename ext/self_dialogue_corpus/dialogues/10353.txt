Did you see Lethal Weapon?
Which one?
Any of them
I saw the first one forever ago.
Yeah same here.
Mel Gibson was pretty funny in it.
I didnt mind Danny Glover's character either.
Would you say that was an action movie?
yeah, I mean why not?
Thats what I think too. It was definitely an action comedy in my view
