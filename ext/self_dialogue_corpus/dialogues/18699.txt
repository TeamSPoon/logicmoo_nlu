What do you think of the music that has been normal since you have been alive?
Well that is a hard one since there has not really been any good choices.
What do you mean?
Well I was born in 1969 so I missed the culture revolution.
Like the Doors, Beatles, Bob Dylan and Jimi Hendrix.
Yes, and those are the ones I listened to in my preteens because my parents did.
What about your teens?
Wen I became a teenager hair bands were coming into the scene.
Oh yeah, bands like Van Halen, Motley Crue, Poison, Twisted Sister and Whitesnake.
Oh they were the greatest but then following them came alternative music with it's "whoa is me, life sucks" messages.
Are you talking about The Cure, U2, Depeche Mode and Duran Duran?
Yes and I don't mean all of their songs presented that message but majority did.
And then the grunge bands came in the 90's?
Bands like Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, Alice in Chains and Stone Temple Pilots.
And what were their message? Hate? Anger?
Do I think it was more along things need to change but we "have no clue how".
Then the next revolution was boy bands or pop on one side with hip-hop and rap on the other.
Oh I know and in my taste in music all of those fell short in artistic value. I started listening to 60's music again.
Now who do you listen to?
I don't since I think music is no longer music but moraless amalgamations of crap!
