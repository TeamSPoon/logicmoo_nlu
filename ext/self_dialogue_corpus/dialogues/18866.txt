What is your favorite album of all time?
Rumours by Fleetwood Mac.
Good choice, although I would say that I preferred their self titled album.
Really? Aside from Rhiannon, I found the album lacking?
What about Landslide? That's a top five Fleetwood Mac song.
To be honest, I find it too sappy. Besides, I don't think that it is in the same league as Dreams.
Well Dreams is an all time great song. My problem with Rumours is that it's inconsistent.
Please explain.
Well you have a a slower song like Never Going Back Again immediately followed by the more up tempo Don't Stop.
I love that aspect of the album. It shows the complexity and mixed emotions of the band that was experiencing numerous breakups while recording the album.
I would like to agree with you, but I just find it weird that songs as different as Song and You Make Loving Fun can appear on the same album.
To each their own. Although I think that Oh Daddy and Gold Dust Woman are the two most underrated Fleetwood Mac songs ever.
I agree with you on Oh Daddy, but God Dust Woman gets its proper respect.
You might be right on that one, I just don't hear it on the radio often.
What are your thoughts on Tusk? You know, the album after Rumours.
I have mixed feelings. The title track is weird because it sounds cluttered.
Yeah, the song's music video with the USC marching band kind of muffles the song.
Agreed, and Sara doesn't even compare to other Stevie Nicks songs.
Well Stevie Nicks was my favorite member of Fleetwood Mac, so the songs where she has lead vocals tend to be my favorite.
Fair. My favorite member is Lindsey Buckingham, so I like a lot of the more guitar heavy songs.
