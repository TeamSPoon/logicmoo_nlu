Did you see the new Star Wars movie?
Yeah.  The Force Awakens!  It's my favorite.
Didn't you think it copied the original too much?
No, dude.  I thought it was very much original.
What about the first scene with that droid?
BB8.
Yeah.  Didn't that man pass off some plans inside it like Leia did in the first one?
I don't know.   I guess I wasn't really paying attenion to it.  I was so jazzed about the movie.  I mean afterall it's Star Wars.
I know.  I know.  I was a huge fan of the original.  I went out and bought as many of the toys as I could.
Yeah.  I still do!
Let's talk some more about the end of it.  That base.  I mean didn't you think it was kinda like the Death Star.
It kinda did.
They even called it Starkiller.
Right. I know. It was after Luke's original name in one of the first Star Wars drafts.
All I am saying here is that I, personally, felt it to had too much in common with the original.
But it's Star Wars!  It took them years to even make these sequels.
And I think they could have done a much better job of it.
I do see your point.
I was no Phantom Menace.
I think they could have done away with all those prequels.
