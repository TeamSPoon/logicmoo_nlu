Have you seen The Nightmare Before Christmas?
No I haven't! What's it about?
It's a Disney movie about Holidays colliding.
That sounds interesting, is it animated?
It's an older stop motion animation movie from the 90s.
Oh, I didn't realize it's been out a long time. What happens in it?
Well the Pumpkin King, Jack Skellington, is like the ruler of Halloween. It starts out on Halloween night, but Jack feels like something is missing, so he tries to take over Christmas after discovering a door to Christmas town in the woods.
So he becomes like a scary Santa Claus?
Yeah pretty much. He has Santa kidnapped and hidden while he makes crazy and scary toys to hand out to boys and girls on Christmas morning and Santa ends up having to fix everything in the end. U
Wow, that sounds like a good movie.
