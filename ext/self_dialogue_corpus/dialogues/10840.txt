Which was the last Fast & Furious movie you saw?
Furious 7.
That was good. Sad though.
You're talking about the scene when Dom and Brian drive in different directions?
That's the one.
Made me feel awful for Paul Walker.
A real tragedy.  They shouldn't have been racing.
I don't know the circumstances but I agree.
Then now there's another film.  The Fate of the Furious.
I guess the whole franchise has been a huge moneymaker.
