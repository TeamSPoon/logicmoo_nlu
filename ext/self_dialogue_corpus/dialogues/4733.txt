Hey, you know what I like? Baseball!
Fooseball?
No! Baseball. You know, Saturday afternoons, hot dogs, programs, all that crap.
I find it boring. Why do the pitchers always spit?
I think they're trying to intimidate the batter. You missed a great Twins game last night.
There are no great Twins games so I doubt it. Did Baby Jesus finally get a hit?
Mauer stuck out. But the pitcher, whatshisname, only threw a 14 hitter game.
Say, that is good for a Twins pitcher. Did anyone get on base?
Dozier got beaned in the head and got a walk.
That's as good as a hit. Anything else exciting?
Actually, yes. A wild pitch hit T.C. Bear and decleated him. I guess he's ok but he'll never be the same bear.
Bummer. Did the Twins charge the mound?
Nope. They just laughed and pointed and spit tobaccy jiuce.
I suppose it's pointless to ask if they won?
Yes, yes it is.
What did you eat?
I wasn't very hungry. I only had a chicken burrito, a burger, two hot dogs, and 7 beers.
Who helped you out of the stadium? Or did you just roll down the steps?
I went with a buddy from worker. He wasn't drinkin'. We had a great time. I don't remember much after the 5th inning, though.
That's the best kind of Twins watching there is.
