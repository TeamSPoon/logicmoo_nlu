Did you watch the NFL Special Documentary?
No, i missed it.
It was awesome!
What did it cover?
The inside perspective of Everything NFL.
Even the locker rooms?
ESPECIALLY the locker rooms!
I'm going to Netflix it.
You should.  Also talked about finances.
Really?
They said that most NFL players go broke after retirement.
I've heard that.
New programs are in place to help them with that.
Especially the newbies.
I'm sure they can all benefit.
Any interviews?
Oh, plenty.
The players and the coaches?
And the trainers, wives and everyone else!
I've saved it on my iPad.
