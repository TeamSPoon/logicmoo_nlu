Have you seen all of the Star Wars movies?
Only a couple.
Which ones?
I saw Rogue One and The Force Awakens. I haven't seen the older ones.
I guess a lot of people weren't to psyched about seeing the prequels.
Which ones are the prequels?
The ones about Anakin Skywalker becoming Darth Vader. Those were episodes 1, 2 and 3.
How many Star Wars movies are there?
There are currently 8 Star Wars movies that have been released, but the first movie, released in 1977, was Episode Six: A New Hope.
That's confusing.
