I can't believe yet another Thor movie is coming out.
What's this one called?
Ragnarok.  Seems like a departure from the previous two.
Isn't he enslaved or something?
Something like that.  The trailer looked interesting.
He's got short hair in this one which looks pretty cool.  Glad they're being different.
I'm thinking it will be the last standalone Thor movie.  Hard to keep producing them.
I imagine so.  I'm pretty sure the studio has tapped that series dry.
I will say I could watch Chris Hemsworth any day though.  That dude is definitely buff.
You would be too if you had a personal trainer.
