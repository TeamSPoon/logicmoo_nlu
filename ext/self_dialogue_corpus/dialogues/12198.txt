What is the cheesiest part of the old Star Wars movies?
I think its funny when they go to that jazz club
Oh yeah the music was really weird
do you remember one alien playing the saxophone? What the heck!
That was a funny scene. Another funny thing was when they are getting squished in the trash compactor
And they try to stop the machine with a long pole?
yeah that's the scene!
On top of getting squished there was a huge snake in ther too!
Yeah that was so random!
makes me feel grateful for the newer movies! Better acting and better plots!
