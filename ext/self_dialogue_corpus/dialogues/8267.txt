Did you hear The Spice Girls are reuniting?
No. Are you serious?
Yeah, but only Geri, Emma, and Mel B are coming back.
Oh, so know Posh or Sporty Spice?
Nope.
That's too bad. I know they all went on a reunion tour around a decade ago.
Yeah they did. I wish I could have seen it.
Me too. I really love all their songs.
I know some of them have went on to have solo singing careers.
Yeah, I've listened to a few of Emma's songs.
