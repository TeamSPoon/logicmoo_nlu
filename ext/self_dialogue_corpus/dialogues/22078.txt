Did you hear that they are making a new Despicable Me movie?
Yes Despicable Me 3.  The kids want to see it.  When does it come out?
End of June.  It looks really funny.  The villian is some 80s guy who wears shoulder pads and has dance offs.
Yeah I saw the trailer and he looks pretty funny but my fav villian in the series is Scarlet Overkill from The Minion Movie.
Yes I love that Scarlett Overkill was such a badass girl villian. Sandra Bullock was so good in the part.
My kids love that young Gru is in The Minion movie.  He can be seen at Villian Con and then at the end of the movie.
Oh that reminds me the new movie Gru is going to have a twin brother.
That's weird since they never mentioned him having a brother.  Do they look alike?
Well Gru's twin has hair and dresses in white so he is the total opposite of Gru.
Ha that's pretty funny.  Does Steve Carrell voice both characters?
I think so.  Speaking of Steve Carell I recently watched a movie where he plays a jerk stepdad.
Yes I've seen the movie The Way Way Back.  It's a total departure for Steve Carell but I've noticed he is doing more interesting movies.
Have you seen him in Crazy Stupid Love?
Is that the one with Ryan Gosling?
Yes and Emma Stone.  I thought they were so cute together.
They must have had some chemistry because they did LaLa Land together too!
I haven't seen that yet.  Was it any good?
Yeah it was entertaining but their were other Oscar Worthy films I liked better.
Oh yeah like what?
Manchester by the Sea was a great movie.
