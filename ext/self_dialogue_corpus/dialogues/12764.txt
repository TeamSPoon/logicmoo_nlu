Hey did you catch The Force Awakens?
The new Star Wars movie? Yeah I saw it in the theater
What did you think about them killing off Han Solo?
I mean he was pretty old, so it wasn't as big of a deal. I really like Han, and I'm upset that he died, but it made for a good story
Yeah it did. And how great was Adam Driver as Kylo Ren?
He's fantastic, and I totally didn't see that twist coming
Do you think Rey will convinve him to come to the light side?
I don't know. I think he might have a better chance of getting her to join the Dark Side.
Really? What makes you think she'd do that?
Rey seemed really angry, and resentful about her parents abandoning her. We still don't know who her parents are, so they could be related for all we know.
