Have you seen the new star wars movie?
No, I never got around to it.
I watched it recently and was pleasantly surprised.
Really? You liked it?
Yes, it was really good.
Better than the last three? Those were awful I couldn't stand the guy who play Aniken.
Yeah me neither. This one was way better.
Maybe I'll watch it then. They're doing three again right?
Yep, the next one comes out in December.
I guess I will have to check out the new one before that.
