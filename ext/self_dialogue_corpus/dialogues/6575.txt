We should watch "The Lone Ranger" later.
I know I still haven't seen it.
It's been out since 2013.
Yes, I remember the trailer for it.  It looked pretty good.
I saw a bit of it playing in a department store.  The train chase scene was pretty crazy.
And Johnny Depp looks pretty cool in it.
Ya he is such a good actor.
And who plays the actual Lone Ranger?
Some guy named Armie Hammer.
I have never heard of him.  His name sounds like Arm and Hammer.
