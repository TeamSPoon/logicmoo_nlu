I've been listening to a lot of country music lately
Oh really? You always surprise me.
Yeah, mainly female singers like Dixie Chicks, Kacey Musgraves, and Miranda Lambert.
So not the bro country about trucks and hunting?
Not so much. A lot of deadly revenge towards abusive husbands though.
How did your new genre acquisition happen?
I get tired of the same stuff, so I go down some Pandora rabbit holes sometimes to find myself a new genre niche.
You haven't switched to Spotify yet?
Nah, I've had Pandora so long, my channels there have so much training.
Sunk cost fallacy?
Pretty much. I'll probably be the last Pandora hold out.
So you're pretty satisfied with it?
The problem with getting most of my music through Pandora is that I actually have no clue who is currently popular.
Ed Sheeran? Katy Perry? Drake?
I know who those people ARE, generically. But I don't know what songs they have that are popular now.
Google says Ed Sheeran's Shape of You is the most mentioned song on the web for 2017.
Nope, never heard it.
Okay, I'm going to make you a playlist. You need to catch up with the times.
Yeah, I'm getting way too old.
We both are.
