Indiana Jones is my favoeite action movie.
What was the best parts of Indiana Jones?
:Remember when the bad guy pulls out 2 swords and start swinging them in a crazy way?  Â Yeah, Indiana just pulls out his gun a shoots him.
Hilarious.
What was  your favorite part?
When the bad guys open the Ark even though Indy told them not to and their faces melted.
Yeah, I think Indiana covered his eyes right?
Yes that's why he lived.
Speilberg's the best.
Yes, for a while all he did was make hits.
