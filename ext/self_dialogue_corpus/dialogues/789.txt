Do you remember who played in the first Super Bowl?
Yeah, I think it was the Green Bay Packers.
And who else?
The Kansas City Chiefs I believe.
That's right. Classic match up.
Yeah, the Packers won as well.
Yeah, Vince Lombardi was the coach.
Oh yeah, legendary coach.
Yep, named the Super Bowl trophy after him.
Do you remember what year that took place.
I believe it was 1967.
Do you know where it took place.
The L.A. Coliseum.
Wow, that place is old. They'd never have one there now.
Yeah, it's definitely dated.
But not too dated for the L.A. Rams.
Yeah, I guess they're still playing there until they have a new stadium.
Do you remember when the Raiders played there?
Yeah, that was a while back.
Yeah, but it was awesome.
