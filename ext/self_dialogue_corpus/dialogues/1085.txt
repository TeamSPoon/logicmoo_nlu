Do you remember the Buffalo Bills of the 90s?
Is that the team that went to the Super Bowl 4 times in a row?
Yeah, that's them.
Yes, that was devastating to watch.
Yeah, it seemed like they lost to the Cowboys a lot.
Them and the Giants.
Why do you think they kept losing?
Bad luck. Missed kick here, dropped pass there.
Yeah, and the Cowboys were really good back then.
Yes, they were.
Who was the QB for the Bills back then?
Jim Kelly
That's right. He was pretty good.
Yeah, had some good position players too.
Thurman Thomas?
Yes, he was the running back.
Man, must be tough to be a Bills fan.
Oh yeah, a lot of heartache out there.
Yeah, plus football is big in Buffalo.
Oh yeah, cold weather city.
