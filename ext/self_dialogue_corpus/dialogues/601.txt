Do you follow the NFL draft at all?
No, not really, It's three days of shenanigans and fifteen minutes between picks is insane.
Plus, all the trading is hard to keep track of.
I feel bad for the fans, seeing their hopes get dashes when the team picks someone the instantly trade them for two picks in the next around.
I watch sometimes.
Why? Seems taxing.
It is, I'll usually have the draft on in the background while doing work.
I'll look at the results at the end, especially if one of my college teams has someone making it.
Which teams?
Schools I attended or taught at. If a student is projected to go high in the draft, or at all from a small school, I pay attention.
Which schools?
An undergrad without a football team.
That's sad.
It's fine. I studied at Penn State and Cincinnati so I follow the draft if they have someone going in.
Where do you work now?
Eastern Michigan.
How often does the NFL get someone from there?
Every 2-3 years or so, ONE person will be selected.
Do they ever make it big in NFL?
Not really. A lot of them are just defensive players without recognition. Looking to see what Hackenberg does for the Jets next year.
