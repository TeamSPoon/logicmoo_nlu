I just saw the what has to be the cutest pants ever!
What are you babbling about, Jessica?
They are called Tying To See You Pants.
"Tying To See You Pants?"
They are  high rise  with a flare pants with a lace up detail on the side hip area.
Sounds interesting. Where did you say you saw them?
On a website.
Did you order a pair?
No.
Why not?
Because I ordered two pairs. One for you and  a pair for me.
Really? Thank-you, dear.
I ordered the top to match.
What does it look like?
It's made of the same fabric as the pants and has the same lace detail.
Does it tie up on the side like the pants?
I wish it did but it doesn't.
Where are the ties?
It ties up in the front. It's a sleeveless crop top.
I can't wait to see it.
