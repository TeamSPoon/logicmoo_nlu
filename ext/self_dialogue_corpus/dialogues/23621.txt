What would you say is your favorite sci-fi movie?
That's a really tough question.  What's yours?
I'd say 'Terminator.'
I love that franchise.  Genre-defining stuff.
Okay, in that case, I have a more difficult question.  Which 'Terminator' movie is the best?
I'd have to go with 'T2: Judgment Day.'  I loved everything about that movie.
Good choice.  The fact that the very villain from the first movie ends up being the savior was awesome.
That was such a cool twist.
What did you think about the T-1000 as the main villain?
One of the scariest villains in film.  I remember not being able to go to bed after watching the movie for the first time when I was a kid.
Robert Patrick was the perfect person for the role.
Arnold of course was great too.
He really was.  What do you think about the other Terminator movies?
Well, I really liked the first one too.  T3 was a bit weak.
T3 didn't do it for me either.  Neither did any of the rebooted ones.
The one with Christian Bale and Sam Worthington was sort of boring.
I agree, but I think it was actually better than the newest one; 'Genisys.'
'Genisys' was a bit of a mess.  What did you think about Emilia Clarke and Jai Courtney in it?
Well as much as I like Emilia Clarke, I don't think the script allowed her to exercise her full acting range.
Agreed.  I hope that if they do make another one, she gets a second chance as Sarah Connor.
