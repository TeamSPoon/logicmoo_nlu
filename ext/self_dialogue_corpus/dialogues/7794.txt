I know you're a big fan of the Harry Potter books. What did you think of the final movies?
I don't know. They were very good. But Harry and Hermione passionately kissing with no clothes on? I don't think that needed to be in a movie for children.
I agree. I didn't like the fact that they were so 'grown up' toward the end.
Well, they could have made them mature young adults, but they didn't quite need to visualize that. I took my six year old daughter to see that!
Oh no! And what happened?
Well, I have to admit, she didn't really understand it. She was more upset about Dobby suddenly dying!
Yeah tell me about it! Did they really need to kill off such an adorable, beloved character?
I guess they killed off a lot of beloved characters, but Dobby was a hard one to see go.
Overall though, I think the movies were as true to the books as possible.
Yes, that's true, they did a really good job of that, especially considering how much material is in the books!
