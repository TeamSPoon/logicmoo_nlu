So who do you think will win the Cup?
I think the Predators will.
They have a stacked Defense.
They do and its perfect for Laviolette.
Yeah he doesnt care too much about D.
Right so he can help develop the offense.
Cant believe less than two years removed from Trotz and they are that close to the Cup.
Well do not discount the Ducks.
I'm not but Ducks do not match up with the Preds.
So how about in the East?
Senators look like they might go.
I dont know about that.
Pittsburgh had trouble with Washington
Well they were a truly stacked team.
Ovi let them down again.
I wouldnt put it on him.
Blame the goalie?
I am.
Their window of opportunity is closing down.
Oh it slammed shut with that loss.
