Do you remember when the first Star Wars movie came out?
I think it was in 1977.
Was it really that long, I feel old now.
Don't feel bad we all do.
George Lucas made the films, correct?
Yes he did and he did a great job, I believe he was young when he made them too.
Do you think he thought they would become as popular as they did?
I doubt it, who could imagine creating the greatest franchise in all of entertainment.
Do you think he dreamed up this world when he was a kid?
I do, imagine a kid around 10 their imagination is at it's peak.  Anything is possible at that age.
