What type of music are you listening to these days?
I'm actually a pretty big fan of Halestorm. They're my favorite rock band right now.
They have a female singer, don't they?
Yes, and she's insanely good. She's also their rhythm guitarist.
I didn't know that. That's pretty cool.
What're you listening to these days?
I found myself looking back at Metallica's 90s stuff recently.
'Nothing wrong there. The black album s a classic.
It is, absolutely. I also feel like Load and Reload are very underrated.
The public didn't take too kindly to those if I remember right.
