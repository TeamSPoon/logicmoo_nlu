A lot of people I know are big fans of the Fast & Furious series.
I am not one of those people.
Are you serious? I really thought that everyone liked those.
I'm dead serious. I can't stand those films.
Oh, come on! What's so bad about them?
They literally took street racing to global warfare. It's just plain dumb if you ask me.
But it's super fun to watch.
Well, I've never found them fun. Just annoying.
They at least have a stacked cast, though.
I can agree with that much, sure.
