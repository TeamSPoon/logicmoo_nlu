Did you see the new Fleet Foxes album drops next week?
No way, really?
Yeah man, on Tuesday.
That's awesome, I'm definitely going to get it.
You're a fan of their old stuff?
Absolutely. Their debut album is one of my favorites.
Same. I also really like the Sun Giant EP.
Mykonos is a jam. They're really talented.
Yeah, I got lucky enough to see them in concert once.
No way really? Where?
In Philly. They killed it.
That's awesome, we should check out if there are any concerts around here.
Yeah, I'll check.
Let me know, I'd be interested in going.
Do you want to head to the record store with me to check it out?
Sure, when do you have in mind?
Tuesday after work, around 5?
Nah, how about Wednesday.
That works. I'll text you then.
Sounds good.
