What is your favorite genre of music?
I would have to say r&b.
Seriously? It's too slow for me.
I love it. I really realte to a lot of the songs.
Who is your favorite artist?
Well I've been listening to Solange a lot recently.
Okay, well I do love her. Her voice is great.
Do you have a favorite song by her?
I sure do, it's on her new Album A Seat at the Table. It's called Cranes in the Sky.
A lot of people love that one. It's not my favorite though.
What's your favorite?
I'm gonna have to go with Don't Touch My Hair.
That is a very good song. Did you know that Tweet sings in the background on her song Weary?
I had no clue. I didn't even know she still sang.
Neither did I. I haven't heard anything from her in a while.
So is the pace of r&b songs the only reason that you don't like it?
No, because all r&b songs aren't necessarily slow. I just don't listen to it a lot.
What's your favorite genre?
I like hip-hop.
Well that's cool. So do I.
