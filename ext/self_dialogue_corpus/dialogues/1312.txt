I want to take my Dad to see the Browns this year.
Will you go to Cleveland?
Probably. It's nice there.
I've never been to their stadium.
They're playing Pittsburgh in September.
That would be a game to see.
Yes, but the Browns will get killed in that game.
Maybe they would surprise you.
I would hope so.
Hue Jackson really needs to lay in to those guys.
Yes, but seems the Browns just can't get into a game.
I know. Some of the games were pitiful last year.
Maybe the Browns will have a trun around like the Indians did.
Yes, they have been doing good.
Maybe Kevin Hogan will throw some outstanding passes for them this year.
I'll keep my fingers crossed for your Dad.
Their total rushing yards are pretty low as a team.
Their statistics aren't that great, are they?
Not really, but I guess they could be worse.
True. Well, I hope you get to go to the game.
