Are you going to get to go to any home games this season?
Yep, I got tickets for two home games this year.
Who's going to be playing?
First game is against Green Bay and the second game is against the Saints.
Both should be good.
Yeah, they are both in December so it will be real cold at Giant Stadium.
I know, I've been there before when it was pretty darn cold.  Went one time when the Giants were playing the Eagles.  It was like 10 degrees.
I've been there in the snow before.  Great games.  That's when they play the best too.
Well, hopefully the season will be going good for the Giants then.
I think it will be.  Their defense is supposed to be real good and if their offense can hold up.
Yeah, well that game against Green Bay will be important I bet.  It's going to be late in the season isn't it.
Uh huh, week 15.  It might decide a home field advantage or something.
Playoff atmosphere.
You ever go to a playoff game?
No, never a chance at getting tickets for that.
Better chance going to a road playoff game then getting in for a Giant playoff game that's for sure.
Hey, that'd be kind of fun.  A road trip.  Where would you want to go see the Giants win?
Dallas.
Yeah, for the NFC Championship.
Or Philly.
