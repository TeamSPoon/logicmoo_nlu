Have you been watching the NBA playoffs this year?
Sort of, but it hasn't been very interesting yet.
I know.  The Celtics might as well just stay home.
They must be dreading the next game.  How embarrassing!
I used to really like watching the Celtics back when Larry Byrd played.  I guess that was 30 years ago or more.
Me too because my ex-husband was a huge Celtics fan. His whole family loved anything IRISH!
The NBA seemed so much more interesting back then.  Have we changed or has the NBA changed?
Well, I know my love for sports hasn't changed, so maybe it's the NBA.
That was back when the OTHER Isaiah Thomas played for the Pistons. But I think his name was spelled differently.
But I heard he IS named after the Pistons' Isaiah. I think because his father lost a bet or something like that, and then his mother changed the spelling.
I got interested in the NBA again last year when I saw Seth Curry making so many 3 pointers. I would tune in just to see how many he made.
He definitely made it entertaining.
I guess it will be Golden State and the Cavaliers again this year in the finals.
You're right.  If not I would be shocked.
Which team would you want to win?
I guess I would want Golden State this year.  I'm getting a little bored with LeBron.
He sure is great though.
Really I just hope they are good games.  I miss the old days when I really cared!
I am going to watch the next Celtics game.  I'm just curious if they can even compete.
It's kind of like watching a train wreck!
