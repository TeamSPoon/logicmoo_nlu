Yo, what do you think about the Eagles chances this year?
Hey man, I am so excited for Philly sports this year, especially the Eagles.
The Eagles have been making moves in the off-season.
I think Carson Wentz is going to be really good this year.
Yeah he will be. Last year he was really good and he was only a rookie.
He still doesn't have that many wide receiver options though.
Alshon Jeffery is pretty good though, he can go to him.
Yeah I guess, but I'm still concerned about the defense.
Their defense is actually good, they have made some moves.
They got Derek Barnett and Chris Long.
I think they will probably end the season 10-6.
That is a little optimistic, I definitely see them being a playoff team though.
Superbowl team?
We'll see. I don't think so. I think Wentz needs to mature a bit and we need an all-star running back or wide receiver.
Yeah maybe, and an all-star on defense.
Right now I wouldn't consider any Eagles player an "all-star", but an all around good team.
We'll see, anything above .500 I would take.
That's setting the bar too low man, a healthy Wentz will definitely give you that though.
True, I just hope they are competitive.
They will be.
