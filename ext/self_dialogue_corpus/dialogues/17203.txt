I love Radiohead.
Radiohead is amazing. Their music and their values.
Values? I just like their music.
Yeah, back in 2007 they gave away their album In Rainbows for free online.
That's pretty cool.
It was, it was technically pay what you want, but you didn't have to pay anything at all.
In Rainbows was a good album. I preferred Ok, Computer, but it was still good.
I heard someone once say that Radiohead was for "boring nerds."
Sounds like they're a boring nerd. Music is subjective.
It really is.
I mean I love Radiohead, but I really loved their bit in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire.
Wait, they were in Goblet of Fire?
Two of them were! The band at the Yule ball was all real musicians including two guys from Radiohead.
That is so cool! I loved that scene. The music was pretty great.
It was! I think it made the scene so much better to have actual musicians and music written for the movie.
You know there's a whole movement called Wizard Rock?
I had no idea! I should check some of that out.
I mean, it's fun, it's not Radiohead, but it's fun.
That's fine. I like Radiohead, but I don't want to listen to them all the time.
Then let's find some Wizard music to listen to.
