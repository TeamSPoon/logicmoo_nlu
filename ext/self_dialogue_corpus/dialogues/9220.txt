What do you think is the worst rock band of all time?
Nickelback, hands down. If you can even call them a rock band.
Haha! I would have to agree.
I mean all of their songs sound the same.
I feel like the say he sings and his voice makes him sound like he's trying too hard.
It's just like generic wannabe rock music. There was nothing unique about them.
Yet, their songs like "How You Remind Me" and "Photograph" were huge hits.
Yea and they overplayed them so much. It was so annoying.
Maybe that's why everyone loves to hate on Nickelback's music, because it was just generic rock songs that were highly overplayed.
Probably. Or people just have bad taste in music.
