I like the old movies the best.
I like them as well though the new ones are good too.
They're good but seem quite different from the old ones to me.
I think the new villain looks like a Darth Vader rip-off kind of thing.
With how he looks I wonder if he's Darth Vaders son.
I dont remember if they covered it.
I don't remember either, I like BB8.
So do I he's quite cute rolling around.
I wonder if hes a lot of peoples favorite character.
He probably is.
