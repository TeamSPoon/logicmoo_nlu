Have you heard Dolly Parton's new album?
I have not. Is it any good?
I liked the bluegrass one she put out a few years ago better.
What is the new album called?
Pure and simple. It's as the title says.
Sometimes I like stripped down acoustics better than overproduced stuff.
Me too. I loved when the Dixie Chicks did that bluegrass album.
Oh, I did too.
I also loved Brandi Carliles new album.
You should listen to the live version at the newport folk festival.
I love listening to newport recordings.
Her live is so good. Her voice is so raw.
Fiona Apple is good live too.
I bet. I loved her most recent album too.
Everything she does is perfect.
Bjork had a heartbreaking album a few years ago.
I was going through a breakup at the same time it was released. I couldn't listen.
Yeah, that would have been hard.
I don't like Lorde's new album that much.
Maybe we're too old.
