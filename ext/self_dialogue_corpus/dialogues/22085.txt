Are there any good horror movies worth seeing?
I haven't seen any advertised just coming in theatres.
I like good ghost and supernatural movies.
Yes, some of the better ones are older though, like The House on Haunted Hill.
Yes that was a good one.
That was a remake wasn't it?
I think the original came out in the fifties.
Well I wouldn't have seen that version.
No I never did either.
I think Vincent Price was in it.
Then you know it was old.  He was a good actor though.
Yea, I don't know the actors names in the newer version, but I've seen them in other things.
Chris Kattan is in it briefly and I knnow I saw the wife in other movies.
Yea, me too.
It was definitely creep inside that house.
Yea, they did a good job and it was kept simple too, not a lot of effects.
Sometimes you don't need them.
I agree. If actors are good they can make you feel like it's really happening.
That's when it's a good movie, the suspense scares you.
Yea, I agree.
