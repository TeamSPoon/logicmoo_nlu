What was your favorite Star Wars movie?
Empire was the best hands down!
I have to say I agree but a New Hope was great as well.
It was and so was Return of the Jedi. But Empire was just so amazing.
For me it's hard to pinpoint my favorite one.
It can be hard because they are all so good.
Are you excited about the new one coming out?
Oh you mean the Last Jedi? Oh my God yes.
I'm excited to see more about Luke Skywalker.
Me too and how he and Rey get along.
