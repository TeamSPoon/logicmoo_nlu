I've been searching the internet for the name of a horror movie I saw when I was, like, 5 or 6. But I can't find it anywhere.
I don't think I was allowed to watch horror flicks at that age.
It was the first horror movie I ever saw, so I think it stayed with me a little.
Everything but the title.
I believe it aired on TV one night around the late 80s or early 90s.
Ah, I thought it was in the movie theater. Could have been one of those made for televisions movies.
Could have been. It was about a married couple that moved new house or were on vacation, or something. And these strange people lived around them.
How strange?
One was a fat middle-aged lady with dark hair tied in a bun. She looked very pale and I think she was a witch. The other guy looked like a Bee Gee who kept threatening the wife.
I'm drawing a blank. But it sounds a lot like that recent Liv Tyler movie, The Strangers.
