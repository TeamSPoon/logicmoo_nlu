So, anyone rap artist I kind of like is Wyclef Jean.
Oh, what songs do you like?
Well, I really like "Perfect Gentleman" because of the way it blends the symphony with his rap lyrics is a really neat combination.
Not sure I've heard that song.
Yeah, it's the one that goes, "Just cause she dances, mo fo, don't make her a ho, no."
Dunno.. maybe I'd recognize it if I heard it.
Maybe.  Another interesting song he did was a duet with Kenny Rodgers.  They did a remake of the "The Gambler."
Say what??  The Kenny Rogers?
Yes, the country star!  They have him doing the original lyrics and Wyclef raping along with it.
Wow, that just seems rather bizarre.
