Did you hear that Carrie Fisher died?
Yes I did. I wonder what they're going to do about Princess Leia in the new Star Wars movies.
Do you think they're going to kill her character off like they did with Han Solo?
Maybe, but they would have to do it off screen.
Maybe they could have another actress play Leia.
I don't think they could replace such a classic character.
That's true, I guess they'll just have to figure something out.
I wonder if they will have to change the plot around to reflect Kylo Ren's parents both being dead.
A lot of the characters don't seem to have parents though - Leia, Luke, Anakin, Ray all were missing parents.
Well, I can't wait to see what they do.
