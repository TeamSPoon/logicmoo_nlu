Did you see the last Eagles game?
No, did you?
Yes, they have an amazingly talented team.
How so?
They plan such interesting plays I've never seen before.
That's cool.
I think that they are also really good looking!
They are a handsome team.
I like their big muscles.
I like their biceps.  They are the biggest I've seen.
DId they win their last game?
Yes, it was so exciting.
Have you seen them live in person?
Yes, I go to the home games a lot.
Do you have season tickets?
No, but I'd like to get some.
They are hard to get, aren't they?
Yes, and expensive.
Good luck getting some.
Thanks.  I'll invite you sometime if I do.
