Who is your favorite member of the fantastic 4?
I really like Johnny Flame
He is cool
I like how sarcastic he can get.
And just being able to turn into fire is pretty cool
Although, being able to stretch your body is an even more impressive skill sometimes.
I do like how they all complement each other in terms of powers.
The 1st movie was pretty good but I prefer the comics
I agree, the comics are way more indepth
I do like Jessica Alba though.
