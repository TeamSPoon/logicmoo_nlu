Do you like the song "Yellow Submarine"?
Yes, it's one of my favorite songs by the Beatles. It was on the Revolver album.
Did you know that Paul McCartney wrote it as a children's song?
Really? There's no hidden meaning in it like some other Beatles songs?
Nope. Paul was just trying to write a song for Ringo Starr to sing, and this is what he came up with. I guess John Lennon helped out a little.
Wow. I guess people can make lyrics mean anything they want! What other songs were on that album?
Let's see...it was released in 1966, so probably Eleanor Rigby and She Said She Said.
Oh, right. Those were great songs as well.
Wasn't the Revolver album the last album the Beatles recorded before they stopped any live performances?
Yes, I think so. It was also the one where they included both psychedelic music and Indian music. Sort of an odd combination.
