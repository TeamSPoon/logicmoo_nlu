Who is the best team in baseball right now?
Believe it or not, it's the Houston Astros.
Really? Weren't they the worst team just a few years ago?
Yeah. But that's when they were in the National League.
How long ago was that?
That was in 2012. They switched to the American League in 2013.
How are the world champion Chicago Cubs doing?
They're not doing quite as well as last year.
Do you think they will repeat as world champions this year?
I'm not sure. They need to improve some this year, but they have time. It's a long season.
So they aren't in first place in their division? If not, who is?
No, they're not. Actually, the Cardinals are right now.
Really? I heard they had a terrible start to the season.
They did, but they're doing much better now. That's my point. The Cubs can still do the same thing.
The Cubs winning the World Series last year was such a big deal.
Oh yes! That's because that's their first championship since 1908.
Wow! That's a very long time between champsionships!
No doubt. But they pitched, hit, and defended better than everyone else last year. They earned it.
I heard the Cubs let Dexter Fowler go the Cardinals.
Unfortunately, yes. I thought that was not a smart move, letting their guy go to a rival.
