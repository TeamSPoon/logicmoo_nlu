What's the strangest instrument for making music you've ever heard of?
There's several really weird ones.
Like what?
The zeusaphone.
What's that?
It uses a Tesla coil. The sparks from the coil produce sound.
Wow, that's crazy!
It's nothing compared to the aeolus.
That's another instrument named after a Greek god?
Yes, and it's the size of a house.
That's incredible!
It's similar to the singing ringing tree.
It is?
Yes, it's also the size of a house. Or, perhaps a tree!
I see. What kind of music does it make?
It's a wind instrument. So, it's similar to a set of pipes.
That's interesting. Any others?
There's also an organ made entirely from ice.
How do they keep it cold?
It's at the ice hotel in Sweden!
