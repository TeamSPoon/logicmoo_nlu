Do you like punk music?
I do, but I haven't heard of any good punk bands recently.
I've heard of a few, but I really like older punk like the Sex Pistols.
They're pretty much a classic.
I did find this newer punk band called MxPx though.
Are they like the Sex Pistols?
Not really.  Their sound is quite a bit cleaner and I think they're even religious.
A religious punk band?  That sounds ironic.
I don't really think so.  Anyway, they're a punk band from Washington state.
I've heard a lot of good music comes from that area.
Many artists have come from that area, including Jimi Hendrix, Nirvana, and Soundgarden.
I really like all of those bands, maybe I'll like MxPx too.
I'm sure you will.  They've even had some mainstream success.
Have I heard of them and not even known it?
Maybe, they had a song on the radio called Chick Magnet a few years back.
No, I don't remember that one.
It's pretty good and was written by their bassist who is the lead singer.
A lead singing bassist?  That's not very common.
No, it's not.  Rush is a pretty popular band whose lead singer plays bass.
Rush is one of the best bands ever!
