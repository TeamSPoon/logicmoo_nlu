What's your favorite Harry Potter movie?
Oh, man. That's a tough one. Definitely not the first or second.
Why not?
They just seem a bit long and draggy to me. Plus, they're a little more childish.
So, out of the rest then, which one?
I would probably have to say The Half-Blood Prince.
That's cool. I really like the Goblet of Fire.
Oh, yeah? Is it because of the whole Tri-Wizard Tournament thing?
No, not really. Mainly because David Tennant is one of my favorite actors.
Okay, but not just focusing on actors. When you think about the plots or movie, which one do you like the most?
In that case, it might be the third.
Prisoner of Azkaban?
Yes, I think that director was really creative with the little additions, like the bird with the Whomping Willow.
Oh, yeah. It seemed much more artistic than the rest. But it seemed to change the atmosphere a little too much from the novels for me.
I see what you mean. But isn't that what can be done with movies? It's only an interpretation, after all.
I guess so, but I like it to have the same feel.
I think J.K. Rowling had a role in approving things that went into the movies, though, so it's not like they could get out of control with any changes.
Yes, but I think that was more related to plot lines and character facts, not necessarily the artistic direction of the film.
Oh, that makes sense.
That's why I like the later films a bit more. I just think David Yates did a better job staying true to the spirit of the books.
