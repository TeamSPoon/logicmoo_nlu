I wonder how many sequels they will do.
It seems trilogy is minimal. Look at star wars. How many movies do we have now? I lost count. Like 9 now?
The original, and prequels, and 1 for the sequel, oh and the rogues series. Yep. We'll probably get 3 of the rogue series. So 12 in the series, not counting animations. and things.
I wonder if Wick series can be as popular? It's not G, so the audience is much smaller.
Still it's the highest ranked movie on Rotten tomatoes with over 85 mill in revenues.
RT is not very accurate in terms of their ratings. Not my favorite.
it's just a guide anyway. Anyhoo. So the Santino guy literally owns Wick at this point?
He holds the blood oath marker. Which means he can ask Wick to do anything, or even kill him.
So he literally owns him. That sucks.
Yep. But still Wick refuses saying he's retired. So Santino blows up his house.
So, all he wants Wick to do is kill his sister?
Santino's sister. Not Wick's. Anyway. Yes. That's the deal. If Santino's sister dies, then Wick is free.
I would so kill the sister.
Well, then that's not really a good movie. There has to be some ambivalence about it to make it emotional.
Well, screw emotions. Wick will be happy after he's free. There's an emotion for ya
That's not a good emotion that sells tickets for this movie. We need pain, suffering, moral dilemmas, etc
But he still accepts the job. you know.
Yes, but only after much deliberation.
So he ACCEPTS the JOB.
Ok, fine yes!. But only after much pain and dilemma. That's the most important part. And then, he doesn't even killer, she kills herself, and he puts a bullet in her head.
