What team is the best this year?
In what sport?
Football
Oh, The Patriots for sure.
That is what I thought you said.
They are the champs
Yeah, but the Falcons blew it
That does not matter
It does. The Falcons are the best
Are you a Falcons fan?
Yes
Why do you like them?
I am from Atlanta
They have a shot, but the NFC is deep
I hear you
I think the Packers and Cowboys are better
They will give them a run for their money
Cowboys are healthier and the Packers are always good
We will see what happens
Yes we will.
