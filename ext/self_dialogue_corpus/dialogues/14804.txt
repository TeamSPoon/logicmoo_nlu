The new Ghostbusters movie was some kind of awful.
I don't think so.  It was pretty solid?
No way.  They completely ruined the original.
It had nothing to do with the original.
Really?  Same basic characters?
Well, kind of.
Plus the original cast made cameos.
Maybe.
No maybe about it.
I think somebody should remake you.
