I have a wedding to DJ this weekend, the request is pop music
Oh how fun, I love Pop
who is your favorite pop artist
Justin Timberlake hands down, he is amazing
I agree, he not only sings so well, but he can dance like I never see
Oh he sure can, whats your favorite song from him?
Oh thats easy, I love "rock your body"
I love that too, I used to love when he was in  NSYNC
I still listen to  NSYNC, I love them!
If you love pop, then you have to love a boy band
