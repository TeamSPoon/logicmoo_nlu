There were an awful lot of surprise trades during this NFL offseason
Yes there were, like Marshawn Lynch coming out of retirement to be traded
They say Lynch dreamed of playing for the Raiders, and if he plays as well as they think he can they'll be heading straight to the top
I've never been a huge Raiders fan, but I'd much rather see them in the Superbowl than the Patriots, Steelers, or Broncos for once
If Carr stays healthy, they definitely have a lot of talent to make it there
Last season was a huge bummer seeing Connor Cook make his NFL debut in a big playoff loss
I don't blame him for that, and I don't think anyone should expect a rookie to do that well under so much pressure
At least with Lynch on their team, they won't have to rely on the passing game so much
Speaking of the AFC West, how weird is it to see Jamaal Charles on the Denver Broncos?
It won't be the first time a player was trading to a fierce rival, but it will be interesting to see him play his former team twice each season
It will, and I hope he'll be back to his healthy self
Seeing him in that regular season game a couple years ago scoring something like five touchdowns was amazing
It was, unless you were like me and playing someone in fantasy football who had him on their team
That many touchdowns has got to translate to a lot of fantasy points
In my first fantasy football season, I drafted Adrian Peterson with my first pick in the season where he made his big comeback
I don't know if it's more weird to see Charles on the Broncos, or Peterson in any team other than the Vikings
The Saints definitely need all the help they can get, and it will be interesting to see if he makes another big comeback
He's already a future hall of famer, but that would cement him as one of the greatest players to play the sport
Now the Saints have him and Brees, two of the very best at their positions
Which means there's even more pressure for the Saints not to completely waste the incredible talent on their team
