What's your favorite AC/DC song?
Back in Black of course.
Love it. Dirty Deeds is my favorite.
I know. Tha's because your brother used to growl at the end.
I remember it like yesterday.
TNT was great too.
There are so many that could be my favorite song.
High Voltage was a great CD.
It was. A lot of people never even heard of it.
The great rock classics.
