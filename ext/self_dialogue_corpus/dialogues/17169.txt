do you like one direction?
not reallyu
their solo albums are actually better
zayn is great
harry styles is better
harry has got that rock vibe
harry has a unique vibe to him
he sounds kinda like the weeknd
i can see it.
harry and zayn are probably the biggest ones
pillowtalk and sign of the times are huge
i dont know which one i like better
they are both good songs
sign of the times is more epic though
especially during the bridge
yeah, when he screams
yeah, he really belts it out
he has a great voice
thats why simon cowell picked them
true
