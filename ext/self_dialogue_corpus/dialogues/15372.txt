Did you ever like 50 cent music?
I loved it when I was in high school.
Me too. I bought the CD.
Yes I played mine over and over.
Which song did you like the best from him?
I remember dancing to "In Da Club".
Of course! That was one of the most popular.
That song and "P.I.M.P".
Oh yes I loved that one too.
My friends and I would play his music videos and make up our own dances.
That sounds like fun!
It was great times!
I miss those times. Playing music videos.
Who else were you a fan of?
I liked Ice Cube too.
Didn't he start acting?
Yes! He played in a lot of movies.
I think he was in the Friday movies wasn't he?
Yep! Also a more recent movie called "Straight Outta Compton."
Right. I want to watch that soon.
