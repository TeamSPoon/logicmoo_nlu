So i went on the Bucs webpage to look up what season tickets cost.
Are you serious? Why would you do that?
I was curious what they cost now.
So, what was the prices?
I don't know, it was taking so long to load, i walked away from it.
Guess they don't really need the money.
I guess not.
Does NFL run their page or do they run it?
They do i believe.
I bet the NFL Has some kind of standard for all of the trwms websites.
Possibly, it's all marketing.
And reputation is part of that.
True.
I want to go to a game this year, i was just curious how much season tix were.
It's not cheap.
There was a link for "interest free financing" fortickets.
You are kidding me.
Nope, you can buy a used car or season tickets.
That's crazy.
I agree.
