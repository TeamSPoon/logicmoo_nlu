So what do you think they should do for the final stand alone movie?
I don't know, I've heard about the possibility of a Boba Fett back story.
I've also heard maybe Yoda, or one about Obi Wan Kenobi.
Kenobie or Yoda would be absolutely awesome.
As long as the bring back Ewan Mcgregor for Obi Wan.
Yes, he was awesome.  I didn't think anyone could stand up to Sir Alec Guinness but he did the job.
Great tie in, Rey turns out to be Kenobi's grand daughter, and the Obi-Wan movie is about keeping an eye on her.
Awesome idea, maybe you should get hired by Disney.
What about for a Yoda story?
Take a look back at centuries of development.
