So, you told me Mama Mia is you favorite movie musical--any others?
Well, yes, they are ones that most everybody probably likes.
Such as?
Phantom of the Opera--my wife and I saw it together and sat in the theater not knowing if the other enjoyed it.
And?
We both loved it.
And what did you like about it?
What's not to like--the music, the plot, the costumes, the grandeur...
And Emmy Rossum.
Oh, my goodness, she is so beautiful.
But she didn't do the singing.
Yes, but she's such an angel.
And now she's in Shameless.
Not quite an angel, but still beautiful.
Back to Phantom--have you seen it on stage.
No, but hope to someday;  I've seen a televised production.
Not quite the same.
No; we did see Mama Mia on stage--not as good as the movie.
Well, what other movie musicals do you like?
We'll have to save that for another day.
