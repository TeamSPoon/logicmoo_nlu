Did you catch the game between the O's  and the blue jays
Yeah!
It was a great game.
Yeah the O's  had that walk off homer at the bottom of the 10th
Yeah I totally thought they'd give that game up.
Well, they have been on a bit of a losing streak lately.
Their pitching needs some improvemeny.
I agree. They either hit well or pitch well. They can't seem to get it all together
Well, it was awesome to see Castillo hit 2 homers throughout the game.
Yeah that walk off homer was his first career homer.
Really? I didn't know that.
I thought good for him.
He's not the best defensive catcher, but the guy can hit.
I thought the same thing.
They've played 500 baseball so far this season.
Yeah but it's still early. I wonder if they can really keep the pace for the season.
I know right? They made the playoffs last year but gave it up early on.
Yeah well the pitching decision was the worst.
They should have bright in Britton. He wouldn't have cost us the game like that.
He rd he best saver in baseball right now in my opinion.
