"My name is Alexander Hamilton ..... there's a million things I haven't done."
Yo! Are you a Hamilton fan!?
Well, I'm a fan of the soundtrack. Unfortunately I don't have the money to see it on Broadway.
Oh me neither. But I've listened to the soundtrack so many times!
Do you have a favorite song?
Yes! The Story of Tonight, the reprise specifically is such a good song.
Oh I like that one, but it's kind of short? Why is it your favorite.
I guess there's just this part that sounds really good. "Well I've heard, you got a special someone on the side Burr."
Oh I like that too, Anthony Ramos has some unbelievable vocals.
Well what's your favorite song?
Honestly, I think my favorite songs is one off of the mixtape.
I love the Hamilton Mixtape! Which one?
I really like Cabinet Battle 3. Maybe because I liked Hail Mary by Tupac so much.
What's that got to do with anything?
Are you kidding me? "Plantation states are packed with promise makers," those are nearly the exact words from Hail Mary.
Oh, sorry. I've honestly never listened to Tupac. Do any of the other songs borrow from traditional Hip Hop?
Well I've heard that growl in helpless was based off Ja Rule's singing voice.
I know the one, "as long as I'm alive Eliza swear to God you'll never feel --"
Exactly the one, and I'm sure there's a thousand more we could go through.
Maybe we could talk about it over coffee.
