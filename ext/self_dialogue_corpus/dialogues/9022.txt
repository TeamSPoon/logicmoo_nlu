Do you like listening to the eagles?
Yes,love their music.
Hotel California is my favorite.
Mine too. The album and the song.
Yes. To bad about Glen Frey passing. He was young.
It's a shame. I think the eagles are still going to tour.
I hope,they do but it won't be the same.
Never will be.
Wonder if they're write any new songs.
I don't know. Maybe don Henley will
