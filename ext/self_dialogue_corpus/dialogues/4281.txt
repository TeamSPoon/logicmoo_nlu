What is your favorite Jake Gyllenhaal thriller movie?
Has he been in many?
I think so.
Like what? I know prisoners but what else really?
Nightcrawler, zodiac,donnie darko,nocturnal animals. life. I am sure there are even more.
Listed liek that he has been in a lot. I would say Donnie Darko or Nightcrawler.
I feel a lot of people overlooked nightcrawler. It was actually a great film.
Jake Gyllenhaal's performance in nightcrawler was oscar worthy in my mind.
I really liked him in that role too. Louis bloom I believe was the character's name. Such a raw performance from jake.
Agreed, overlooked performance and movie in general.
