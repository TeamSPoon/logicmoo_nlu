Who is going to win between the warriors and the spurs?
I think the Warriors will win.
Why?
The warriors have too many weapons.
I agree with that.
Although, the spurs do have the best coach.
Do you think kerr will coach?
I am not sure. I heard he was at practice the other day.
That is a good sign. I think they need him.
I don't think they need him need him, but he would help.
Who will be the key to the series?
I think Steph.
Why?
His shooting makes the defense have to spread too much of the floor.
Yes, that is dangerous with the warriors ball movement.
Best passing team in the game.
Yes, they always seem to find the open man.
It is beautiful to watch.
You have got me excited about the game tonight.
Me too. I hope the warriors sweep.
