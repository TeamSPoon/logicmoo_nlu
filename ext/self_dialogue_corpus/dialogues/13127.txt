So do Han and Leia ever have a child?
Well they cant now
Right but in the time between the 6th and 7th do you think theyll write in they had a child?
Sort of like how Luke found out he was Vader's child?
Exactly, can you see that happening?
It would be too easy of a plot line.
I think Rey would serve as a good one.
I dont think they would pick that low hanging fruit.
Could you see them having a child on the dark side?
That would be more of a probability for this film series
