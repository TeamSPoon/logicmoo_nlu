Do you like animated films?
Usually, why?
I saw Trolls recently.  It was so cute!
Was that a Disney movie?
No not that I recall.
Who was in it?
Justin Timberlake, Anna Kendrick, Zoey Deschanel, and Gwen Stefani among others.
Sounds like a good musical cast.
It was.  Justin sang like an angel, they kept saying.
He used to be a Mouseketeer, I heard.
Well he was an executive producer on the film.
Was there a lot of music?
Yes, mostly older songs.  Anna Kendrick sang most of them, and she can sing!
Yeah I've heard her sing before.  Nice voice.
She played this cute troll princess.
Nice!  Did Zoey and Gwen get to sing?
Of course!  They had their moment to shine.
What did you like best?
When Justin's character sang to his grandma.
That's so sweet!
