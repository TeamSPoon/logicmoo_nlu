Do you remember the orginal Salem's Lot movie?
No, when was it from?
1979, it was a Stephen King novel they turned into a movie.
What's it about?
Its about an evil house that gets rented by two antique dealers who bring a vampire to the town.
I love vampire movies, I wonder why I don't know about it.
Probably because its from the 70's.  But you should see it, its terrifying.
Is it gorey?
Not really, just really creepy and suspence full.
I'm gonna see if they have it on amazon or appletv, I wanna see it now.
