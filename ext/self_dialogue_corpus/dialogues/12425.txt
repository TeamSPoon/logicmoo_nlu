I'm not as much of a hater on the changes Lucas put into the remasters.
Whoa wait, you like the digital effects touch ups on the original trilogy?
I don't hate them, they're what he would have added if he could have at the time of filming.
I do not agree with that, it seemed to me like something he was doing just to put bullet points on the box.
See but you can never really know that.
What other logical reason is there to obsessively add stuff to films that are already perfect other than artificial value?
A man thinking he can do better, people give him a bad wrap for so many things I feel bad.
While I don't think he is being malicious when he adds stuff, at the same time it's okay to not like them.
I guess you're right, it's just kind of sad to watch people rag on the creator of Star Wars.
Oh agreed, I will never stoop to that level because he gave us such a gift.
