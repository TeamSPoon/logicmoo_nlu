Do you like the band U2?
Yes, I enjoy their music very much.
What do you like about them?
They have a sort of spiritual and equal rights message in the music?
You like that part?
Yes, I like music that means something.
Also, the music sounds good.
True I like the sound.
What is your favorite song?
I like "silver and gold".
That's a song about apartheid in South Africa.
Yes, but the message is so true.
About how the world is ruled by silver and gold?
Yes, so true that is what makes the world go around.
And everyone is ruled by the love of money.
Money is everything to most people.
Even if it means stepping on others.
Yes, it's a shame people are so greedy.
I like Pride in the Name of Love too.
That is also a great song.
