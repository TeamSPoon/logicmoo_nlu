Do you think the NFL cares about the safety of the players.
I think they care, but I don't thinks they will make any significant Changes.
Well they better think about it before they lose all of their best players to injury.
They don't care about the players enough. There will always be more players to fill in when someone gets hurt
Don't you think they are worried that kids will stop playing football?
No.   There will always be football. It is americas favorite sport.
What about the viewers. They might lose viewers.
Never.  People will never stop watching football.
Yeah. You're probably right. With as much as people gamble and play fantasy football, they will always tune in.
While I don't personally like injuries, it is a rough game and injuries happen. Sometimes it adds more excitement to the game.
That's what you say until someone on your favorite team gets hurt.
My favorite quarterback never gets hurt so I am not worried.
Who is your favorite quarterback?
Tom Brady. I am a huge fan of his ever since he played for Michigan in college.
Ugh.  So you're a Patriots fan then? I can't stand patriots fans.
Darn right I cheer for the champions. Did you watch last years Super bowl?
No. I had better things to do than watch the patriots cheat.
You're just mad that your team will never be as good as the patriots.
Maybe so. But my team doesn't deflate balls and spy on the other team.
We are the champions my friend. And we'll keep on fighting till the end.
