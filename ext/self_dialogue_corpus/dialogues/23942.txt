I had a Harry Potter marathon the other night.  Whats your favorite set of movies to have a marathon with?
I'm not sure.  I had a Pirates of the Caribbean marathon this weekend so I could catch up for the new one.
Who is your favorite character in that?
Johnny Depp was the best of course.
See I really thought Kiera Knightly did well.  She hasn't been in all of them though.
You don't like Captain Jack Sparrow?
I do but I think Johnny Depp overplayed him a little bit. He acts extreme in a lot of his films.
I think he's a great actor.
Did you see Mortdecai?  That movie was absolutely awful.
Yeah but look at all the hits he's been in.  Edward Scissorhands, Sweeny Todd, and Blow those are some great movies.
I will give you that, he's been in some good ones.  I just think lately he acts like one character and that's it.
Some people say the same thing about Helena Botham Carter or Jim Carrey.
Jim Carrey has done some good dramatic work.  The Truman show was a really good movie.
He was kind of goofy in that one too which is kind of how he is seen by people.
That's true. Speaking of him did you see Dumber and Dumber To?
Yes, I thought that movie was terrible.  They shouldn't have bothered making a sequel.
The first one was funny but the second one was just silly.
Did you see that the first part of the end credits shows clips from this movie and the original?
No, I didn't even catch that.
Yeah, most people were out of the theater before the movie was even over.
