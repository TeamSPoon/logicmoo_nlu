Have you seen any good movies lately?
I have. I know it's not the newest movie, but I just watched Creed.
That's one of the Rocky movies, isn't it?
Yes it is. Rocky trains Apollo Creed's son for a big fight that he's having.
How was it?
It was a lot better than I expected. Creed's son, played by Michael Jordan, did a very good job acting.
I'll have to check that out. Are there any movies that I should avoid that you have seen recently?
I know a lot of people liked it, but I didn't really like Get Out.
What is that movie about.
It's a horror movie. Basically, it deals with people getting hypnotized.
What didn't you like about it?
I just didn't find it to be very scary. I guess my expectations for it were a little higher than what they should have been.
Are there any movies that you are looking forward to?
I am looking forward to the new Avatar movies.
The first one was really good.
It was the first movie that I saw when 3D started becoming a big deal.
The effects in that were really good. That was definitely a movie that exceeded my expectations.
Cameron Crowe did a great job directing it.
Wasn't he the director of the Terminator movies?
I believe he was. He is connected to quite a few good ones.
