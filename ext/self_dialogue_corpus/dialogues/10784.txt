So do you think they will keep having success on the Fast and Furious movies without Paul Walker?
I would say yes, they sitll have the Rock and Vin Diesel who are both headline actors
True but the whole series without Paul just doesn't seem right and its missing something dont you agree?
I do agree but look at Tokyo Drift, noboby was in that one except for Lil Bow Wow and it did pretty good at the box office
Yeah that one I don't even consider as part of the Fast series it should just be called Tokyo Drift and drop the Fast and Furious logo
Did you know that a new Fast is being released sometime this year?
No I didn't but I guess i'll give it a chance and see if it's any good
Should be like I said they still have The Rock who is a great action actor
Yes I really liked him in Faster and The Scorpion King
Aw Man those movies were awful what bad examples of his better work.
