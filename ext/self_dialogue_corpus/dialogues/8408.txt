Hey  Y'all, Whose your favorite Pop Star?
I LOVE RIHANNA'S "BITCH BETTER HAVE MY MONEY
I like all of her sounds, she fantastic
Yes, she is and she does a great job collaborating with others
For sure. Every soundtracks she's been on has been a hit, like Jay Z, Umbrella
She did a great job with Eminem, "Love the Way You Lie"
The lyrics was great and the beats were deep
Do you know Rihanna was recognized as the 2017 Harvard's Humanitarian of the year
That's fantastic, what charities do she support?
It's the Clara and Lionel Foundation scholarship to support effective education and health programs around the world
