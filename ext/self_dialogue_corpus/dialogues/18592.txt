What is your favorite kind of music?
It kind of varies. I love Imagine Dragons though.
Me too, their songs are so easy to get into. Even though I've heard Radioactive tons of times I still love it.
Yeah. They have some good new stuff too.
Yeah, I hope we can see them in concert some day.
When was the last concert you went to?
Man, I think it was like 15 years ago honestly!
Oh really, who did you see?
Weezer.
I love Weezer! 'If you want to destroy my sweater...'
'Pull this strand as I walk away...'
'As I walk away! '
Haha love it. Honestly I love oldies music too.
Me too, like 50's rock n' roll stuff.
Yes!
And then there's the Beatles
The Beatles are classic. Can't go wrong.
My mom always plays the Beatles birthday song on our birthdays.
I love it!
Yep, all you need is love.
