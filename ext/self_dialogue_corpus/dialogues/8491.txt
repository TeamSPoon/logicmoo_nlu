Who to you most admire Mylie Cyrus, Selena Gomez, or Taylor Swift?
You mean the young queens of pop music?
Yes, they are current leaders. They have replaced Madonna, Brittany Spears, and Katy Perry.
That's an interesting progression!
Well, that's the nature of pop music. They only love you for a short time, and then they move on.
That's kind of sad.
I don't know. They being a pop music star pays well.
That's true. Anyway, I most admire Taylor Swift.
How come?
She seems to have been the best at handlng the stress of being a pop music star.
