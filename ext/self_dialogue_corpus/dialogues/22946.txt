Have you seen talledega nights
I just watched it for the first time the other day
Really?
Yes
I cant believe you just saw it
I know its crazy
What did you think
It wasnt as bad as i thiught it would be
Yea it was an okay movie
Still completely stupid though
Oh yes very stupid
Im suprised they didnt make a sequel to that
I kind of am too
I figured they would
Me too
Maybe it was too stupid
Thats possible
Good talking to you
