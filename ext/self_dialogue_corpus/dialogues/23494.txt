Sow ho is your favorite actor right now?
I would have to say Paul Rudd.
I like him as well, he has some really good movies out.
Yea, I just got done watching This is 40.
Was that a sequel to that movie Knocked up that he was in?
No not really a sequel, more of a spin off if anything.
I thought Knocked up was an awesome movie in its own right.
Yea it wasn't bad, I just wished Rudd had a larger role in it.
I agree with you there, it would have been much funnier!
I thought he and Seth Rogen had some great chemistry with one another.
So have you seen all of his movies?
Sure have! I would have to say my favorite is Ant-Man. I thought that one was really good.
I agree with you, Micheal Douglas was in that one, right?
He sure was; and was outstanding in my opinion.
I wonder if they will be making a sequel to it?
Yes! It is called ANt-Man and the Wasp and it will be coming out in 2018!
I bet that will be a hit right from the very start.
Yea, I will most likely pre-order my tickets to make sure I get in on opening night!
Paul Rudd is one of te most talented actors out there, I will give you that.
I sure think so, I cant wait to follow his work in the future.
