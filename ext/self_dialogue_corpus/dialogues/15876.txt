I have been listening to a lot of 80's music lately. Do you like 80's music?
Yes I do, I like a lot of the soul music from that era.
Me too! Who do you like the best?
I love the group called Soul II Soul, and I love Lionel Richie's music from the 80's too.
What is your favorite Lionel Richie song from the 80's?
I love the song called All Night Long.
I remember that song, it's on his album called Can't Slow Down.
Yes, I love that whole album!
It's one of my favorites from the 80's too!
Soul II Soul is the other group that I mentioned, I really love all of their music.
I am not sure that I remember them. What were some of their most popular songs?
In 1989 they had a song called Keep On Movin' that was popular.
I think I remember that song now, I remember that they played it a lot on the radio back then.
Yep, they played it a lot! It got to number five on the UK Singles Chart in March 1989 and number 11 on the US Billboard Hot 100.
I really liked that song back then, but I didn't know much more about them.
They we're quite popular in the 90's too. They had some different lead singers in the 90's but still remained popular for awhile.
Are there some other good songs from them that I should listen to?
Their first album Club Classics Vol. One, came out in 1989. The whole album is very good.
I will see if I can find the album for sale online. Thanks for letting me know about it.
Your welcome! I hope you like it.
