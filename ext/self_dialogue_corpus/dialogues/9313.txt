What do you think was the best era for rap/hip hop music?
I'd probably have to say mid 90's.
Oh, good choice.
Yea. I feel like during that era was really a golden age for rap.
Totally. It's like rap was so new and amateur in the 80's, but during the 90's rappers were really perfecting and modernizing hip hop to what it is today.
Yea, I think that probably some of the most influential rap artists came about in the 90's.
Oh for sure. Tupac, Biggie, Redman, Lauryn Hill, Snoop Dog and Nas to name a few.
Yea, those artists totally paved the way for what hip hop is today.
They owe a lot to those "forefathers" of hip hop.
That's for sure. Such a good era...I wish I could go back and relive those days.
