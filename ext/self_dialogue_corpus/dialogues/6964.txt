Wait, is it still Disney movie if pixar makes it?
um... yes.
Um Why is that?
Because Disney own pixar. And pixar is one of its studios.
But Disney animator didn't make the film.
yes they did. pixar is ONE of Disney's studios. All of pixar is Disney, wholly owned.
That's weird.
more business than I'd like for one day.
I can't wait for the incredibles's sequel.
Next summer. That' when it will be released. That's going to be so good.
