Have you seen the movie 9 to 5?
Yes, Dolly Partin is in it.
Also Lilly Tomlin.
It is a really good comedy.
It also has Jane Fonda in it.
It was directed by Colin Higgins.
I like the song.
That song is by Charles Fox.
It is a 20th Century Fox film.
It's budget was $10 million.
It made $100 million.
It was released in the 1980's.
The opening credits has it NINE TO FIVE.
Their boss was played by Dabney Coleman.
I liked how they took over the company.
And they tied the boss up in his home.
They sent one lady to France to get her out of the way.
But then he broke free.
Dolly Parton forged his signatures.
It is a really funny film.
