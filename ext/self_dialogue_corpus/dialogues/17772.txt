I am going to a Zac Brown Band concert this weekend?
Really?  I am not sure I like country music
I love it .  I especially love Zac Brown Band, I have seen them before, they do some covers of other artist too
oh really like who
well the last concert I saw they did "Into the Mystic" by Van Morrison
oh thats interesting I really like Van Morrison
They also did "goodbye Girl" which is a song I really like  That sond is originally done by David Gates
oh I really like that song too maybe I would like going to that concert
yes they are a lot of fun, its a very summery party beachy atmosphere
sounds like I might actually enjoy a country music concert
yea they remind me of jimmy buffet
oh now I do like jommy buffet, I love margarittavile
yes we like that music too, we were in Key West and they have people with guitars in most bars playing music like jimmy buffet
Yes "Son of a Sailor" is one of my favorite songs
thinking of those songs brings back great memories of vacations and going on cruises
Yes that music definitely reminds me of summer
I went to a Jimmy Buffet concert once and I really like the woman who sang with him, she was from the caribbean and had a great voice
yes I know that woman that you are talking about she is featured in several of his songs
She is very talented and has a wide range in her voice
I agree she compliments him well
