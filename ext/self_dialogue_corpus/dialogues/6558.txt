Have you seen Moana?
No, I haven't.  Is it any good?
Yes, I love it!  The soundtrack is awesome.
What's your favorite song?
"You're Welcome," the character Maui sings it, and he's voiced by The Rock!
Oh, I've heard that song!  I didn't know it was The Rock.
Yup, he's actually a really great singer, and his character is funny.
Didn't the guy from Hamilton write some of the music?
Lin-Manuel Miranda, he did the music and lyrics for a bunch of the songs.
It sounds awesome, I'll have to check it out!
