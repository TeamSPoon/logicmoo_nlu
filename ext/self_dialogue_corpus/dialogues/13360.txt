Did you enjoy Rogue One?
I did enjoy the new movie.
I loved Jyn.
I think it's great that they're showing more female characters.
She reminds me of Rey!
I wish Jyn and Rey could've met in one of the movies.
That would be an interesting interaction!
They could talk about fighting the Sith.
Only Jyn never met a Sith Jedi!
True, but they both fought villains.
