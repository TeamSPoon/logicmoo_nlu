Have you ever heard of Mason Jennings?
No, who is that?
He's a folk singer. I really like him.
Hmm. I don't know what I think about folk music.
I like it a lot - I have purchased all of his albums
Wow. That's not like you -- you don't really like music much.
Right. I got into him when I was in college and had more time for music
Life is busier now, isn't it?
Yeah. Anyway - he's really good. You can check out his stuff on YouTube
Awesome, I'll give it a go.
Great! He tells a lot of stories in his songs
Like what?
Well, a lot of love stories.
Cheesy!
No, not really. They are sweet. Also a lot of songs about death, haha
Sheesh. Sounds awesome.
Haha, they aren't bad. Just a little sad sometimes
What's your favorite song of his?
It's called "Forgiveness" - it's beautifully poetic.
That sounds nice.
