Do you want to talk about movies?
Sure, movies are great.
Do you have a favorite movie?
I really like the x-men series
Those movies are great, one of my favorites too
Do you have a favorite in the series?
Probably wolverine.  You?
The first one, first class. Where you're introduced to everyone
I like wolverine because they bring him back and finally tell his story.
Yea, that one was pretty good too.
Do you have a favorite charater?
Probably xavier, it's so hard to pick though.
Yea, I always liked jean, and she has so much power.
She does, I don't know why she doesnt use it in the later movies.
I dont know either, I definitely Italy think she's more powerful than xavier
Yes she definitely is, she saved him in the first apocalypse
She did, she was amazing in that one
That is a great movie, that might be my favorite
It's hard to pick.
I know
