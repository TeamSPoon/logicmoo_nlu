I just saw The Third Man.
I never saw it.  Who's in it?
Orson Welles and Joseph Cotten.
Sounds cool.  Who directed it?
Carol Reed.
Based on anything?
Graham Greene wrote the screenplay, then the novel later on.
What's the plot?
Joseph Cotten plays a writer (Holly Martin) who goes to Vienna for a job offered by Welles (Harry Lime).
What does Martin write?
He writes Westerns.
Funny.  Who is Harry Lime?
He is a racketeer. He is killed early on.
Then what?
It turns out the killing was staged and he is not dead.
What happens next?
Holly Martin finds out Harry is selling bad penicillin.
Then what?
Holly helps the police find Harry, who really dies in the end.
Sounds like your normal Graham Greene plot twister.
