So what do you think about the Detroit Tigers?
Overrated. I don't see them going anywhere this year.
Are you kidding me? With the bats they have?
They are only at .500! Can't be that great...
They did have a few injuries.
Doesn't explain everything. Besides their piching stinks.
It isn't that bad. They have three aces that are pretty good.
Again, being .500 in May isn't a good sign. They aren't exactly overpowering.
They're in a tough division. They'll come around
Not with Cleveland in that division.
Tigers have dominated Cleveland this year.
Luck only. They aren't nearly as talented.
With Miggy and J.D. Martinez? They're superstars!
They still have no pitching. The bullpen is horrible.
Pitching is always streaky no matter which team you're talking about.
I don't see this group getting any better.
They'll come around. Verlander is still on top of his game. Plus he has Kate Upton to help him at home.
I'll give you that. Won't help the team much though.
I still say they will win the division.
I wouldn't bet on it.
