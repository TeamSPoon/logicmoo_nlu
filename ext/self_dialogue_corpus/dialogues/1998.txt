EJ just got picked by the Bills.
After watching that, I got back into the NFL again.
How do they pick these quarterbacks to start?
I have no idea. Who would fool around with these low calibar quarterbacks this close the bowl?
Tell me about. Cutler, who thought of this guy?
No, says the guy who's team got screwed by replacement referees.
Did Steven A interviewed Manning?
I guess they can improve once their head coach is gone.
Have you caught any of the St Louis games.
Oh, Brees has at least 3 seasons before they consider him.
Let's hope Flacco's new contract can get him to the finals.
It shouldn't take him more than two seasons to hit the finals.
Ej's not evne that bad. Six years with the Bills is more of a punishment.
I think he's doing alright, but the Bears are quick to get rid of coaches.
Either than or they trying to makes sure the team doesn't sale.
Well, what good is Manning's accomplishments if they haven't helped his team get to the Super Bowl?
Ben, Brees, Romo, these guys would kill to play alongside Manning not Brady.
I want him back next season, but it's pointless if he's still injuried.
Dalton, can't be that picky. It's not like he's going to get on a playoff team.
That may be but he won't be getting as big of an offer.
