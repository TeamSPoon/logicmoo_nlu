So will you be watching football this year?
I'm not sure.  I used to love the Buffalo Bills...
It sounds like you don't anymore.  What happened?
Well, my favorite player was Doug Flutie.
Yes, he was amazing.  So what's the deal?
Do you remember when they replaced him in the playoffs after he got them there?
Oh yea, that was a long time ago though!
I know but it soured me on the team.
I thought it made sense...
How can you say that?  He was the quarterback who got them there in the first place!
I know but they had to make the decision they thought was best for the team.
That obviously backfired!
You never know what would have happened...
True, but I know what did happen.  Management proved themselves to be disloyal and they lost anyway.
You sure sound angry after all this time.
They were my favorite team as my grandfather was from Buffalo.
Well, that makes sense.  So you don't watch at all anymore?
I might this season.  Who are you rooting for?
The New England Patriots, of course!
I'm so tired of hearing about that team!
