Which band do you miss most from when you were in high school?
I was in high school in the early 2000's, and I really miss Story of The Year.
Oh, man! I loved them!
So did I. My favorite song by them was, "Until The Day I Die".
That was a great hit. I also loved, "Anthem of Our Dying Day".
That was an awesome one as well. Who else did you like?
I was also into Dashboard Confessional.
They were cool! I liked Brand New.
I loved their song, "Mixtape".
Now that one was a classic!
It sure was! I was never into Taking Back Sunday, though.
I never got too into them either.
I've noticed a lot of bands in more modern times sort of replicate them such as Panic! At the Disco!
I've noticed that too. I could never really get into the newer bands.
Switching subjects, what about older bands. Which one of them is your favorite?
I think I would have to say the Beatles.
I never got into the Beatles or the Beach Boys.
Wow! The Beatles are classic, though.
I know, I guess I just have heard them too much.
I can see how that could happen. Still an awesome band, though!
