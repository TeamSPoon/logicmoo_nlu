Hey have you heard that Adele song, rolling in the deep?
Oh yeah, I really like that song. Adele is a pretty great artist.
She has a very strong voice. What's your overall favorite genre?
I'd say I'm honestly less of a pop fan and more of an alternative rock fan.
Really? Tell me a few of your favorite artists and I'll tell you mine.
Well I'm a big fan of the red hot chili peppers, Popevil, Three Doors Down, and Breaking Benjamin.
That's quite a list you've got there! Mine are Peter Bjorn and Jon, The Lumineers, and Mumford and Sons.
Seems like we have quite different tastes in music. Do you like The Killers?
Oh I love them! You know I saw them at the Music Midtown Festival a few months back.
Really? How are they live?
Let's put it this way. They blew away every single other artist there, and The Lumineers were there as well.
Well now you've got me jonesing to see them live! I'm definitely going to have to look around for some tickets soon.
I heard that Rise Against is playing in the area soon. They're another one of my favorites.
Seems like you've got some eclectic tastes when it comes to music. Who else are you into?
Well don't call me an Indie snob, but I also like Neutral Milk Hotel, Tegan and Sera, and Death Cab For Cutie.
I won't call you an Indie snob. Most of those artists have gone mainstream by now anyway.
That's true. I don't know what Death Cab is considered these days. I guess still the Indie genre?
I suppose I would say so. A lot of people would say they've sold out.
I never say an artist has sold out unless they totally change their style to something that panders, which they have not done at all. Ben Gibbard is a genius.
You've got that right! Now we've really got something we can agree on.
