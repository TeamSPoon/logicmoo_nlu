Who is your favorite Star Wars character?
General Leia, hands down.
Really? Why?
Because she's amazing.
How do you think they'll resolve her story?
I don't know. I'm hoping they do her justice.
It's going to be hard, though.
I agree. So who's your favorite character?
Also General Leia.
Great choice!
