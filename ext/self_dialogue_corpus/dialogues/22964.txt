What's the difference between the light and the dark sides of the Force?
I'm sure it's that "the Emperor wants to control outer space. But Yoda wants to control inner space".
Ten out of ten my friend, ten out of ten! And what movie is that line from?
Human Traffic. I love that film!
Danny Dyer giving it the full cockney treatment. He's the star of it for me.
Who's the other actor? The one who shouts about "the weekend has landed"?
John Simm.
A hugely underrated actor as far as I'm concerned.
There was a time I memorised that whole opening speech in Human Traffic.
It's good, but were you that bored? But then I still know people who quote the film to me.
Let me guess..."nice one bruvva!"?
That's the one.
What's your favorite scene? Mine is the one in the nightclub with the news reporter.
That's hard to beat, but have you watched it recently?
No I haven't, I think I probably should though. Relive old memories.
The film has dated horribly, live on the memories but don't spoil them by watching it again.
Really? The soundtrack is still incredible though.
That I can't dispute.
I wonder what a film about the underground music scene of this generation would be like?
I've got no idea, but I'd love to see it! Nice one bruvva.
