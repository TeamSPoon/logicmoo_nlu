Did you enjoy the fashions Met-Gala this year?
Yes it was great! How did you enjoy the red carpet looks?
I loved them. Rhianna was my favorite.
Yes. She really stuck to the theme of the night, which was to celebrate fashion designer Rei Kawakubo.
Certainly. Her dress was big, bold, and very unique.
Yes it was. I had never heard of the designer Rei Kawakubo until now.
I have never heard of her either. I think this year's dedication will really bring her a lot more recognition.
I agree. I also enjoyed Rihanna's makeup that went with the dress.
Yes. The elaborate pink eye shadow was a great touch and really brought out her facial features.
Also her hairstyle really topped it off as well.
Yes. The bun on top of her head was incredible.
Interestingly her hair and makeup did not take away or conflict with the dress.
No, they didn't. All 3 went together perfectly.
I wonder if she chose this dress herself?
Possibly a stylist, however it would not surprise me if she chose it on her own.
Yes. She has a unique, wicked style all on her own.
Yes. I think that is why she was able to pull this look off.
Right. We are already used to seeing her in flamboyant outfits.
I think she was best dressed of the night.
I agree. Well done Rihanna!
