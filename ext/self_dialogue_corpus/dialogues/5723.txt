Do you think Cruella D'Ville was a 'good' villain?
I'm not too sure about that. Who wants to ever make a coat out of a dog's skin?
I am not sure but I lived the fact that her hair was perfectly split between black and white.
I like the way she drove like a maniac.
The style of car was very befitting as well.
I agree. I could not picture her having the same effect if she had driven a VW bug or a side panelled station wagon.
What about how thin she is with her pointy cheek bones and long skeletal fingers?
I know it makes her look like a ghostly nightmare lady.
I like her aristocratic nature.
I think she does make a good villain.
