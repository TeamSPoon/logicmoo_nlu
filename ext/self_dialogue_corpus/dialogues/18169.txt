I am in awe of film composers. The best ones are able to change the personalities of their scores to fit just about any genre or mood.
I think one of the most iconic film composers was Bernard Herrmann.
I agree with you. I collect movie soundtracks, and I have quite a lot of Herrmann scores.
I know he did some classics that everyone recognizes - North by Northwest, Psycho.
He also did scores that are talked about less, but are no less wonderful.
One of my favorite scores is Mysterious Island.
He did a lot of fantasy film scores, and they are all amazing. Mysterious Island had those crashing cymbals in the main theme.
Just the music for that intense balloon sequence at the beginning really got the blood moving and set you up for the rest of the adventure.
One of my husband's favorite Harrmann scores is The 7th Voyage of Sinbad.
Another fantasy score, and another great one. It captures the exotic flavor of the setting.
I think the most romantic score Herrmann wrote was for The Ghost and Mrs. Muir.
What a great movie that was. My husband adores that score - he would play the soundtrack over and over, and just lose himself in it.
He did a ton of Alfred Hitchcock films. You've already mentioned two of his most well known - North by Northwest and Psycho.
Another Herrmann Hitchcock score I love is Marnie. It's romantic also, but eerie and mysterious, since the movie deals with the mystery of why Tippi Hedren is the way she is.
He did the score to a classic sci fi film, The Day the Earth Stood Still.
You know, I cannot even think of some of these films without hearing the score in my head.
That's what makes a great composer. The music brings the film alive, but it also has a life of its own.
Remember when the original Star Wars came out? The main theme actually made it into playlists on radio.
That was astonishing. It's a testament to the iconic music of John Williams.
I don't suppose the screaming strings of Herrmann's Psycho score would do that today, ha.
