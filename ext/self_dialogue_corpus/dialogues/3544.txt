Have you seen '28 Days Later'?
No, what's it about?
It's about a zombie takeover of England. There's really creepy footage of London just completely empty.
I like zombie movies, I'll have to see it.
It was directed by the same guy who did 'Trainspotting', too.
Oh I love that movie. That's scary in its own way.
There's a sequel too called '28 Weeks Later', but in my opinion it's not as good.
Same director?
No, it's a different director and I think that's why it's not as good.
Always best for horror franchises to keep the same director.
