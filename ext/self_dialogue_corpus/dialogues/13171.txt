Who is the most powerful Jedi from the Star Wars Movies
I think Luke Skywalker, but I guess yoi could say Anakin Skywalker too
Before Anakin turned to the dark side during Revenge of the Sith you mean?
Yes, because Darth Vader does not count as a Jedi
That makes sense, but I do think Yoda may be the most powerful
In Attack of Clones we saw him fight Count Dooku so that makes sense
Yoda was both wise and powerful, which is why he trained Luke
Obi-Wan Kenobi is underrated though, he was also very wise
Yoda and Obi-Wan together in the Empire Strikes Back were a formidible duo for Jedi training
Wait we forgot about Mace Windu
