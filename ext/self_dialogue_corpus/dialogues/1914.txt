Football is right around the corner.
I know I can't  wait. Who do you think we are going to see in the Super Bowl?
I don't know, but I can tell you who I'd like to see. Falcons and Raiders.
Wow! I don't think it's likely but what an amazing match up.
Two amazing offenses, two amazing defenses. It would be a real game.
You're right it would be a close game too. Who would win?
Again I don't know, but I'd give money to see Marshawn Lynch talking to reporters after that game.
That would be entertainment enough. Speaking of Beast Mode, what about the Seahawks?
If they can get their locker room issues we could see them in the big game. It's football so I mean anyone could really make it.
Who would you want to see them play.
If Texas can figure out who is going to throw the ball
That would be an interesting game but I don't see it happening. The Titans have some cleaning up to do.
Seattle is going deep again though. I wouldn't be surprised if they went all the way once all the egos and feelings got put aside.
Patriots against Seattle?
It would be a good game, but New England would walk all over Seattle.
Seattle against the Raiders?
The Raiders would have to make their way through New England and Pittsburgh and that's not going to happen.
But it would be fun!
Yeah watching Lynch play his old team and win!?
Anything can happen!
