I saw Return of the Jedi last night.
Which version?
The Blu-Ray disc, 2011.
What were some of the changes?
They added new aliens to Jabba's palace, and they replaced the Ewok song at the end.
Didn't they change the trio who appears at the end?
Yes, the Anakin from Star Wars III is shown.
What about the Sarlacc?
They added a computer generated beak.
Neat.
