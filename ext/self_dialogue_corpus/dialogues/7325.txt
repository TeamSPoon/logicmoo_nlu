did you ever watch romantic disney movies?
i didnt even know that disney made those
yeah movies like lady and the tramp
oh i think ive seen that, who were in that?
it focused on the two dogs that met and kinda fell for each other.
now i remember, and the owners also fell in love?
i think so, it has been a while since i last watched it
yeah same here, i liked the scene with the noodles the dogs were eating
Me too that scene is so memorable
Agreed i think everyone likes that scene also.
