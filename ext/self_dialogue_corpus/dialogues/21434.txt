Have you seen all of the Fast and Furious movies?
Yes! My husband and I actually watched all of them recently.
Which one did you like the most?
I think the first one. It had all the original characters in it.
I think you're right, I especially like that one.
I haven't seen the most recent one yet, have you?
No but I have been meaning to.
I think it may be sad though since Paul Walker's death.
I know, I'm not sure if it will be good since he won't be in it.
Right, but I do love Vin Diesel as an actor so maybe it will be okay.
I sure hope it will be. I will still give it a chance.
I've heard that the story line though was not that great.
I heard that too. Maybe people are just getting tired of so many of those movies.
I think you could be right. It should still be given a chance though.
I agree. Most of the original characters are still there.
Yes and I do like some of the newer characters, like Tyrese and Ludacris.
I do too! They are part of the story now.
Yes and fit in well with the team.
When did the most recent Fast and Furious come out?
I think it was maybe this year.
