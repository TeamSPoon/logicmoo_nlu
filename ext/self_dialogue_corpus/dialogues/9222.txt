You know who's early music is frequently being overlooked by radio stations?
No, who are you talking about? American or British, or what?
I'm talking about David Bowie...He was British.
Oh, sure. "Space Oddity", I know it.
Well, that's what I mean. Most people know that one, from his earliest American release.
Well, what else is there? "Changes" is another that I recall.
Yep, that's another that gets played a lot. But my favorites hardly ever get played, like ones off the album, "The Man Who sold The World".
Didn't Kurt Cobain do a cover of that? Wasn't it with Nirvana?
Yes, but my favorite is called "The Supermen". It's about a society of supermen that are so desperate to die that they battle each other in games every year, on purpose.
Didn't he also write a tune about a computer who wanted to destroy the word in "Savior Machine"? I love that one too, and wish they would play it on the radio more often!
