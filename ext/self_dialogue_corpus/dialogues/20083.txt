What did you think of the Twilight series?
Overall, or just the first movie?
The first one first?
I actually liked it. I thought it had a good direction, and was stunning in scenery.
Really? You liked the way the plot went? I did not.
No, not so much the plot I did like the real feel of the movie.
I thought it was rubbish. I did like the story line in the second one though.
I did too, I thought it had more structure but not the third.
No, that was confusing. I like the editing though.
Yea, it looked really pretty. I hated the sparkle scene.
Oh yeah, me too. Killed it unlike the last one.
Oh, the last one was actually good, in my mind at least.
I liked the action. I think they got a new director for those ones.
Well, they made it better. Did you like the plot of the last movie?
Yes, I mean to an extent. Could of been better.
For sure. I hated the whole creepy baby.
Yes, the baby really threw me off the movies as a whole.
So, which was your favorite?
The first one I think and you?
The last one.
