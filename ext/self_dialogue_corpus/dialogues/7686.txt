Do you have a favorite Harry Potter movie?
Probably 'Goblet of Fire', but it's really touch to pick. You?
'Prisoner of Azkaban' just because of Gary Oldman.
He plays Sirius Black, right?
Yes, he does. He plays that character so well.
He's literally unrecognizable in those movies. I didn't even realize it was Gary Oldman.
I didn't either until I read it online. The caliber of actors in Harry Potter is unbelievable.
I think that speaks to the quality of the writing, both for the books and the movies.
They did a great job adapting the books.
They really did - I'm a big fan of both the books and movies.
