Have you seen Moana yet?
Yes! I think it might be my new favorite movie.
Me too! Who is your favorite character?
Definitely Maui. He is my hero. Who's yours?
I like the chicken... He's an interesting character.
I agree, I do like him too!
Did you know that the girl who does the voice for Moana had never acted before?
No, but she has a great voice. She was a good find!
She was. I love it when they can find new talent like that!
Me too! I'm excited to see if she will show up in any more movies now.
