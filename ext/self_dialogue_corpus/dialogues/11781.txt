Doc, I have a terrible ringing in my ears. Can you help me?
It depends...
It depends on what?
Well, you have to understand that the human condition is complicated.
Yeah...
And health is a delicate balance between strength and weakness, light and dark, and joy and sorrow.
What are you saying Doc?
I can't help you unless you take those headphones off.
Oh, sure! Hey, it stopped!
What were you listening to, "Ring My Bell" by the Anita Ward?
