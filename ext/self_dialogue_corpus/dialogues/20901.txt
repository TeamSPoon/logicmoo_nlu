I saw the new Wonder Woman movie last night.
Oh yeah?  What did you think.
Surprisingly good.  Great character story I thought.
It helped erase some of the stink from Batman vs. Superman.
Well, she didn't need to be in that movie anyway.
They were trying to introduce her character into the DC universe.
I guess, but I wonder if they could have accomplished the same thing by just placing her directly in Justice League.
Probably so.
Anyway, with the new movie, I liked the direction quite a bit.
I heard that it was done quite compellingly.
Yep, it was actually a female direction.
That's pretty cool.  You don't see many in the director's chair these days.
The set pieces were done excellently.  Lots of emotion throughout the film.
I heard one criticism though.
What's that?
That the end battle was way too much CGI.
I agree with that to a point.  It got a bit heavy-handed.
But overall, it sounds like you enjoyed the experience.
Most definitely.  Highly recommend.
I'll have to catch a showing this weekend.
