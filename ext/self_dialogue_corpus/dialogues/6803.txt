What's one of your favorite Disney movies?
My all time favorite is The Little Mermaid.
Yeah, I like that one, my favorite is The Lion King.
That's a good one too. I also really enjoyed Aladdin when I was a kid.
Yeah, there are really some classic Disney movies out there.  Have you seen Mulan?
Yes, that's also a good one.
My kids love Frozen.
Mine too.  I like that the plot revolves around two sisters, it's a little different than other Disney movies.
Yes, it has a sweet story line I think.  My kids love the music and Olaf.
Yes, Olaf is a great character!
