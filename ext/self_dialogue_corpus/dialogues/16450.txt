Hey, what do you think of the "Despacito" song on the radio?
Ugh! Don't even talk to me!
What? It's a great song.
Yes, it's a great song. But get Justin Bieber outta here!
My take on it is, he's bringing Latin music to a wider audience.
Maybe, but he ruined the song! He can't even speak Spanish.
Do you really thing the song would be as popular without Bieber?
Maybe not, but good music doesn't have to be popular with every teenage girl.
Okay, then, what's a Latin hit that the U.S. should be listening to?
Chino & Nacho all the way. They're a Venezuelan group who have been popular in Latin America since 2008.
Do you have a song recommendation? I'd like to listen to more Latin music.
"Andas En Mi Cabeza" is a song they did with Daddy Yankee. "Ni√±a Bonita" is another favorite of mine.
I think actually I've heard those with my Colombian friends.
Probably! They're very popular in Colombia too.
Okay, so I'll drop the Bieber version of "Despacito" and listen to some better music.
You better!
What other genres of Latin American music do you listen to?
Well, I lived in Ecuador for a few years, so I like traditional Andean music. Check out "Maria Chun Chun"!
I'd like to get to know the hits and more regional music, as well.
That's a good take on it. People listen to a mix of everything!
