Dude you think Ezekiel Elliot is going to run for 2000 yards this year?
no not really.
Why not that dude is so good.
No he's not, the Cowboys line is so good.
Ok either way, Zeke was the rookie of the year, that means he's really good.
No it just means that the NFL wants to reward it's position players in big markets.
You're such a conspiracy theorist.
No man, People are just gravitated towards numbers, and since lineman can't really put up numbers, we all just want to talk about how good the position players are.
Yeah but look at some of his highlights.
Any professional running back in the league could do many of those same things.
What do you mean?
Zeke is getting to run through 6 foot holes, anybody would look good with those holes to run through.
So who is a good running back then?
Honestly, I don't really care to label any running back as good.
What are you talking about.
Every runningback is only as good as the line he runs behind.
I mean, I guess.
Look at Emmitt Smith.  He's the career rushing leader, but he had the best line ever, and just happened to never get hurt.
Bro, you're ridiculous.
You just hate me because I'm right.
