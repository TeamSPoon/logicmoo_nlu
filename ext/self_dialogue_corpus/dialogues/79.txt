Do you plan on watching Thor?
When does it come out?
I believe late in the year 2017.
When exactly does it come out.
I don't believe there is a release date, but I think I saw online sometime in November.
I really like his character overall, what do you think?
I agree, he is not one of my favorite characters but he is pretty good.
I liked his hammer and how no one else can pick it up.
It was funny when the Hulk couldn't even pick it up.
That was a great part of the movie.
