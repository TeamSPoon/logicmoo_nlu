Do you like horror movies?
I do, for the most part.  I don't like really gory movies.  I prefer creepy, like ghost stories and stuff.
Yeah, I'm kind of the same way.  I like haunted house movies a lot.
Oh, yeah, me too.  Like, I liked Insidious, which was kind of a haunted house movie.
Yeah, I liked those movies too.  I liked Sinister a lot as well.  Although that was a little bit bloody.  A lot of people died in it.
Oh my God, I saw that.  The really creeped me out big time.
Me too.  That was one of those that stuck with me even as I was trying to fall asleep.
I like the older scary movies almost more than the current ones.  For instance, Poltergeist is one of my all time favorites.  I can watch it again and again.
That's a great movie.  Definitely a fan of the classic version from the eighties.  I thought the new one was really disappointing.
It was awful.  Some movies just shouldn't be rebooted.  They got it right the first time.  Why do it again?
Exactly.  But they never seem to learn their lesson, do they?  They just keep making inferior new versions of excellent movies.
I thought Nightmare On Elm Street was another example of that.  The original was scary and really well made and unique.  The remake was just the opposite.
At least there are certain ones they don't seem to touch.  The Exorcist, for instance.
Yeah, they're leaving that one alone.  Good thing too.  I'd hate to see a lame new version of that.
Did you ever see a movie called Ghost Story?
I'm not sure.  What was it again?
It's based on a book and it's about these four old guys who accidentally killed this girl and she comes back to haunt them.
I don't think I've seen that one.  Is it good?
It's not really hugely popular, but I've always liked it.  It's creepy, for sure.
Well, as I said, I like creepy.  I'll have to check that one out.
