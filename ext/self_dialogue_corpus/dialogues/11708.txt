I just listened to the song Yesterday by the Beatles.
That is a great song.
I love their music because every song is so different.
I agree I really like Back in the USSR.
It's amazing what a sensation they were.
Definitely they were so popular.
I can't think of another band who had such a following.
I wish I had been able to see them live one time.
Me too, but for now I'm going to download some more of their music.
I have a book about the Beatles, now I'm going to take a look at it.
