Only a couple months before football begins again.
I know and I'm really excited.
Me too, my favorite team just finally got a replacement running back.
Which is your favorite team?
I'm a Seattle Seahawks fan.
So you're referring to replacing Marshawn Lynch?
Yes, hopefully our new running back will provide what we need.
Who is the new running back?
We traded for Eddie Lacy.
That might be a good fit, I've been a fan of his for some time.
I've been impressed with him in the past, but I'm concerned why Green Bay would trade him away.
That's definitely a valid concern.  Most teams wont trade high profile names unless there's some reason for them to do so.
I've seen lots of comments about his weight and it contributing to injuries.
I think I remember hearing that he was overweight.
I saw a couple games where he clearly looked to be too heavy.
Hopefully he'll be a hard worker for the Seahawks.
If he can stay in shape I think he will be the best addition to the team since Russel Wilson was drafted.
And if he can keep from getting injured.
That's always a concern, but I feel like he's more durable than the other guys we've had the past couple of seasons.
It seems like that Thomas Rawls guy is always hurt.
