Sup bro, how's the weather?
Good, I'm loving it.
Me too. Feels like a cool shower may be coming.
Yea maybe.
Did you go to the concert last night?
No, who was playing?
Ozzy Ozbourne was there. You missed out big.
Ah shute, I meant to go, I forgot.
A bunch of sexy sluts too. Next time you have to come.
Yea, I won't miss it.
Me neither. Ozzy is the best.
Yeah, he's the coolest.
He'll never get old.
His music is still some of my favorite.
No doubt.
I'll be there the next time he comes to town.
Me too, I'll give you a reminder.
Thanks.
No problem, anytime bro.
I appreciate it.
