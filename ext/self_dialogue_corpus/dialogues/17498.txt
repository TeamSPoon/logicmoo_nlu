I was upset when I heard that The Civil wars had broken up.
Yes, so was I. They were one of my favorite bands.
I still listen to so many of their songs. They're timeless.
Likewise, and I think it was such a pity they broke up in 2014.
Their collaboration with Taylor Swift on the Hunger Games soundtrack was sublime.
Goodness, yes. Safe & Sound is such a haunting, unique track.
And who can ever forget Dust to Dust?
It's another one of their hauntingly beautiful ballads that I could listen to forever.
There are other amazing songs of theirs too that I love, like Poison & Wine.
And also the joyous From This Valley.
They enjoyed a meteoric rise to the top and won four Grammies.
And then they decided to part ways. Whatever happened?
I'm not sure, but they cited 'internal discord' and 'irreconcilable differences'.
Strange how two people can be so close and make such amazing music and then break up.
Yeah, they used to have such a positive energy and spark about them.
Now, they can barely stand to speak to each other.
Do you think they will ever get back together?
I'm not sure. But for the fans' sake I hope so.
I can't help feeling The Civil Wars aren't about to release a new album anytime soon.
Alas, I would have to agree with you on that.
