Hey, what do you think of the Raiders chances this year?
I think they will definitely be a lot better and keep improving.
You think they will have enough to make a run at the championship?
I don't think they have all the pieces quite yet.
I think with Derek Carr signed to a new deal we are really investing into the future.
Yeah, Carr is a stud, but do you think he is worth all of that money?
I think he got 5 years for $125 million, which is a lot, but he is a rising star.
That makes him the highest paid player in the league by average salary, lot of pressure on his shoulders.
It is for sure, but he's shown so far that he handles the pressure, brings a winning attitude, and he's a leader.
No doubt. I think he has it all to be able to lead the team to a ring, but like I said they need more pieces.
I think adding Marshawn Lynch is huge.
Yeah, he is one of the greatest ever for sure, his age is a bit worrying though.
Yeah he is getting old, but I think the one season break will have he refreshed and ready to go for this year.
Yeah he will need to take the pressure off of Carr a bit and score some touchdowns.
I think this is exactly what the team needed and we can really start making a statement in the league now.
I think the team is coming together quite nicely, got the quarterback, running back, and receivers. Now that offensive line and defense needs work.
We made some great picks in the draft for the defense and as you said everything else is pretty solid.
I think if Carr keeps improving and making the team better then they will be a contender in no time.
I sure hope so. It's been a tough time being a Raider fan the last decade.
I hear you. I just can't wait for the season to start!
