So, seen any good Disney movies lately?
Let's see.. I saw Moana not too long ago, it was really neat.
Oh, I haven't seen that one yet.
Yeah, it's guys The Rock voicing a character in it, so that's pretty cool.
Yeah, I've seen previews for it.  I rented Zootopia not too long ago.
Oh, what did yout hink?
Actually, I could not get through it.  I'd gotten the disc from the library and it keep stopping on me because it was so scratched up.
Really/  That's sucks.  Did you try cleaning it?
Yeah, I did but that didn't fix it.  I dunno if it's true or not, but i read someone that Sony DVDs are REAL sensitive to scratches.  Supposedly if I'd bought a $50 cheap DVD player I wouldn't have that problem.
I assuming you mean "$50" was cheap for when you first bought your player, because you can DVD players for like $25 nowdays.
