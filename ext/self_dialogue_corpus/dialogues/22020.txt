I really like the Disney Pixar movies. Do you have a favorite?
That is so tough. I think Finding Nemo though.
That's great one.
I remember thinking the concept was so dumb and not wanting to see it. I ended up seeing it three times in theatres!
I guess you really did like it then.
Yes, I did. The one that was kind of disappointing for me was Inside Out.
Why do you say that?
I just thought the concept was amazing and so insightful. The movie ended up being kind of dry and boring.
I thought it was good.
Well, I don't think it was terrible, I just thought they could have done so much more.
I guess I can see what you are saying. Was Wreck It Ralph Pixar too?
No, that was just a Disney one. Tangled, Bolt, Frozen and Moana were all the same way.
That gets so confusing.
I know. But they all end up being great movies.
It sort of seems like the Pixar movies are the ones that aren't musicals.
I think for the most part that is true. I can't think of any that are.
I wonder if that is on purpose.
I don't know. It could be.
I just don't know how any other animation studio can compete.
Well, Universal has some good animated movies don't they?
