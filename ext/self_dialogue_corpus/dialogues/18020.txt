Do you like Greenday?
I love Greenday, mostly their older stuff.
I agree, the album Dookie was my favorite.
My daughter listens to Greenday. I always think it's cool when my kids are listening to people I like.
What is your favorite song?
My favorite song is Longview form the Dookie album.
I like Basketcase.
Isn't Basketcase about Billy Joe's anxiety?
I think it is.
I always liked the "hidden" song at the very end, All By Myself.
I love that one. I had no idea it existed for several years after the album came out.
Do any bands put hidden songs on CD's anymore?
I doubt it, with so much music being downloaded, no one would ever hear them.
True, I never thought of that, most people don't buy CD's anymore.
Right. I consider myself a die hard fan and I don't buy  CD's anymore.
Well, I hope you pay for the downloads.
I do. I am afraid too many artists will stop making music if it keeps getting stolen.
I agree, I would hate to see good music die out.
Especially bands like Greenday.
Hopefully, Greenday made enough money in the last decade that they won't ever go away.
