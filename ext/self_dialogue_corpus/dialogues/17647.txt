What are you listening to?
Greenday.
What? Are you kidding me?
Yes. I am actually listening to the new SZA album.
I think I saw a poster on the street advertising the album.
It's called CTRL.
What's your favorite song so far?
Love Galore. It features Travis Scott.
I haven't really listened to SZA except for that song she has with Childish Gambino.
Do you mean Child's Play?
Yes, I like that song a lot. I don't doubt this new album is also great.
I just bought it on iTunes. Come over and we can listen to it, if you want.
Okay, that sounds fun! I'll bring over some of my records to listen to as well.
Make sure to bring your Loveless vinyl.
Of course. My Bloody Valentine never gets old.
Agreed! What else do you have?
I just bought a B-52s vinyl at Goodwill the other day.
I'll pass on that. I am not a fan of college rock.
Are you kidding me? Not even Weezer?
Especially not Weezer!
