When did movies get really good for you?
What do you mean?
Is there a certain point where you feel filmmaking really hit a stride or something?
Something really seemed to change in the '60s.
How so?
It seems like that's when it started getting more acceptable to make something realistic on a wider scale in Hollywood.
Wow. Where might that have started?
Who knows? It was probably pretty gradual. The studio system, which was huge in the '40s, really messed things up, honestly.
Yeah? The Golden Age of Hollywood?
For sure. For all the praise, it's like there were 3 types of men and 2 types of women in just about all of them.
But not ALL, right?
Orson Welles had his vision even then, but it's like there were only a few "sets" of mannerisms actors had.
What might have changed that?
Well, you'd see it here and there in older movies. I don't want to ring this bell too loudly.
Yeah. 12 Angry Men comes to mind.
Now, that is an example of variety in characters on a few levels.
I often half-jokingly say that pre-Bullitt Hollywood didn't tell stories that well; it was too censored, and things weren't as intense as they were in real life.
Let alone MORE intense, or at least romanticized in some way.
Yeah. That one really was a precursor in a lot of ways for action movies, especially the rogue cop thing. That was not huge pre-1968.
They didn't go out of there way to give you a sense of speed in car chases in the '40s. That's for sure.
