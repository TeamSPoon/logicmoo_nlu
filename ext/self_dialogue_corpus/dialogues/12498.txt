I saw Star Wars episode 1 on TV last night, I can not believe the first episode came out in the 1970"s.
Yeah, that is a long time ago.
I like all the episode, the special effects is great.
Yeah,when Star Wars first came out, I thought the characters were funny looking.
That is part of "Star Wars" charm,the funny and weird looking characters.
I like Empire Strike Back, when Darth Vader VS Luke Skywalker.
Yeah, that was cool, Luke Skywalker almost lost the fight.
Luke Skywalker was trying to get Darth Vader back to his good self in that episode.
Yeah,Darth Vader end up dying in "Return of the Jedi",how sad.
Yeah, but Darth Vader came to realize he was on the wrong side in the end.
