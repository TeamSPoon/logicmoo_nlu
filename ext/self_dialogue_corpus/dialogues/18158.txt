What do you think is the best music video of all time?
There have been a lot of great ones!
For sure. But what's #1 for you?
Maybe the video for the song 'Come to Daddy' by Aphex Twins.
I've never seen it, nor heard the song.
The song is really awesome, very dark and sinister. The video kind of enhances it.
Nice. I think my favorite is the music video for the song 'Black Hole Sun' by Soundgarden.
Now that video, I have seen. And the song is wonderful.
Yeah. Something about the combination of the song and the video really does it for me.
When you think about it, music and images go together extremely well.
That's two of the five senses!
Haha, smart guy. What I mean is that music is already emotionally powerful, and then when you add imagery, it enhances it even further.
I knew what you meant, was just giving you a hard time.
I think that Rock music naturally pairs the best with music videos.
Really? In what sense?
The combination of guitar, sung vocals, and drums. I think it's a powerful pairing with imagery.
Moreso that other instruments?
I'm thinking more about something like Hip Hop or R & B music. I like those genres, but not so much the music videos.
Hmm. I can think of some great Hip Hop/R&B music videos, though. What about 'Crossroads' by Bone Thugs in Harmony?
Ah, true, that is a killer song. And video.
