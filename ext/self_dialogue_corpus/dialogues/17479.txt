what do you look for in music?
I honestly like a unique voice.
so say joanna newsom?
She is right up my alley.
I enjoy her as well. i love that she plays the harp to.
I adore her. But I also liek a wide range too, say julie brown and alanis morisette.
so kind of eclectic taste then.
Ya, I am little bit all over. What about you?
I enjoy all music but really love classic rock.
cool, what are your top rock bands?
The rolling stones are really high on my list.
They have been rocking it for many years so makes sense.
Ya they have a ton of hits under their belt. I loved their forty licks tour.
Was that like the greatest hits?
Pretty much . It was a world wide tour for their 40th anniversary compilation album Forty Licks.
That would have been a great concert to see live.
It was, every time I see them I think it may be the last chance.
Well they are getting up there in age. I am impressed that they are still alive.
Agreed, especially Keith!
Ha, ya maybe all the drugs keep him young.
