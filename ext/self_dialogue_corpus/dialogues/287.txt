What's your favorite superhero movie?
I'd say Batman
Do you like the old ones or the newer ones?
I totally like the newer ones, like Dark Knight
Yeah they are made a lot better than the older ones
The older ones are cheesy but good
The graphics were bad
That's why I like the new ones with Heath Ledger and Christian Bale
The plots seem so much better and have a lot of action
I hope they never stop making darker superhero movies!
