I love action movies
Wanna watch one?
Ever seen The Crow?
Yes. I love it
It was made in the 90's right?
Yes
I remember loving that character so much
I forget the movie though. What is the basic storyline?
A gang kills a guy's wife and him and then he comes back from the dead for revenge.
Oh yeah. That was intense
I agree
Where does it take place?
In a city. I am not sure what one
I loved the makeup
Me too and the action scenes
I wish they still made action movies like that
I know. There aren't any like that anymore
Is part 2 good?
Yes, but the first one is way better
I've never seen the second one.
