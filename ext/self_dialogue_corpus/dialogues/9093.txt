What rock band do you listen to most often?
That would have to be Stone Sour!
They are pretty good, though I have a hard time with some of their songs.
What do you mean by that?
Some of the songs are really depressing and talk about giving up on everything.
That is quite the point of their House of Gold and Bones albums.
Yes, it seems so. Why do you like them?
It's the deep thoughts and inner darkness that the music produces which draws me.
Maybe you have depression issues?
No, that's just all part of the enjoyment in some rock music.
