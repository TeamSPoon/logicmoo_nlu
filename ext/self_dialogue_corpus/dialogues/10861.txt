The latest 'Fast' movie felt rather empty with Brian, Paul Walker's character.
I absolutely agree.  I am just glad that the send-off was so good in 7.
It was truly an emotional and touching farewell.
I liked that Dom named his new baby after Brian in the latest movie.
I did as well, though I don't think it necessarily made sense.
How so?
Well in that movie universe, Brian is technically still alive and has just retired.  By that logic, why would they tribute the baby with Brian's name?
Oh wow that's actually an excellent point.
I think it would have made more sense to name the baby, Paul.
I agree.  That way, it is a tribute to Paul Walker but it also makes sense in terms of the movie's story.
