Do you like foreign thriller movies?
I have not seen too many.
If you like thrillers, it is an nice niche of the genre to get into.
What would you say is best to start with.
I would go with a newer one, like Hunt.
Is it hard to follow?
No, you can get English subtitles.
Does that take away from any of the thrill?
No. It makes it a bit more scary, adds some mystery.
I will have to start looking into them.
