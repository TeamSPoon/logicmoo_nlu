Hi there.
Hello.
What kind of music are you into?
I like rock and folk and some pop.
When you say folk what do you mean?
Like the newer stuff.  Like Mumford and Sons.
Oh okay.  I only know a little bit about bands like that.
I saw Mumford and Sons in concert they were great.
That must have been a fun time.
It was a blast.
Who are some other bands like that.
I also like the Lumineers.
I think I have heard a few of there songs.
I also saw them live.
Wow do you watch a lot of live music?
Yeah I love going to see live music.
Why is that?
The atmosphere is so great.  It is really alive.
I should probably go see more.  Not too much stuff comes through where I live.
If you get the chance I would highly recommend going to see live music.
