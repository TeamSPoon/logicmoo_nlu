Why is it that every-time I turn around someone on TV is wearing a blouse with the shoulders cut out?
It is the new in trend, you know.
Why? It is not all that appealing to me.
Really? I think it is sexy. Showing a little skin, it looks good.
Not to me it doesn't.  Some of these hosts already show too much skin as it is if you ask me.
You aren't kidding with that one.
Last night while I was watching the news with my five year old son, the female host dress showed too much cleavage.
This morning, while I was watching the daily news talk shows, one of the hosts was wearing what looked like a halter top.
You're kidding? On national TV?
I sent them an email telling them how I was appalled by her attire.
They probably disregarded your email.
I don't think they did. Because after they returned from there next commercial break, she was wearing blazer over it.
I hate to ask this but did the blazer match her outfit?
No. No it did not. Her halter top was red, her pants were black and the blazer was lime green.
Lime green? I can't imagine how humiliated she must have felt.
I sure she was but when you go on live TV at the time of day when children are watching  and you are dressed like that, then oh well.
You're right. I understand where you are coming from.
Even though she was dressed inappropriately, I actually liked the earrings she was wearing.
What did they look like?
They were circular dangles with what look like blue gemstones going down the middle.
