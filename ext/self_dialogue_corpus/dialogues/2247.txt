I can start to feel the excitement for the upcoming season
Yeah tell me about it, I have been too long without some football.
So how do you think your favorite team will do this year
I am optimistic, but waiting to make sure no major injuries in the pre-season
What do you think their record will be?
Well I really hope for a playoff appearence dont really care about the record
Yeah I guess you are right
As long as they get into the playoffs it does not matter if you were 15-1 or 8-8
That was some superbowl last year
Yeah what a great come back
I do not think anyone can doubt Tom Brady now
I agree but you know there will still be some that do
I think he is the best ever
It is hard to argue with that after another superbowl win
Of course it does not hurt having Bellichik as his coach
I do not think one would be as good without the other
It is like a perfect match
I wonder if we will ever see something like them again
In this day of free agency and injuries I think it would be hard to duplicate
Well lets just enjoy the moment then
