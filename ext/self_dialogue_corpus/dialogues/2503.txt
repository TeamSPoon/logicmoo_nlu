Who do you think is the best coach in the NFL?
That is easy Bill Belichek.
He does have 5 Super Bowl rings. Hard to argue with that.
He has had a good asset with Tom Brady but his knowledge has a coach has helped lead the team to victory.
That comeback against the Falcons last season was epic.
He goes down as the greatest coach ever for that.
I don't know if anyone else even comes close.
Mike Tomlin is a pretty good coach. If he had a QB that could stay healthy he would have more championships.
Mike Tomlin has a 1-1 Superbowl record.
It would be sweet to have a Superbowl ring.
Another great coach is Sean Payton.
Without Drew Brees Sean Payton would have been gone years ago.
Somewhat agree. Sean Payton is an offensive genius but he needs some help with the defense.
If they can get a strong defense in place the Saints will be contenders.
Pete Carrol is another great coach.
I believe he will lead the Seahawks to another Superbowl.
He did it a couple times already.
He was yards away from having two Superbowl rings.
That is what I love about the NFL. It isn't over until it's over.
That makes for some exciting games.
