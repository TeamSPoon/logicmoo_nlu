Here, try this. Ever been to a Willie Nelson concert?
Oh yeah, thanks. I shook his hand.
Yeah, me too. That's beautiful, the way he shakes everyone's hand.
The way he performs is gorgeous too. Much better than his recordings.
Yeah. Kind of vaguely reminded me of Sinatra though.
Wow, I noticed that too. It's like he falls back on Sinatra-type phrasing.
Well, he could do worse.
True. Did you notice the herbal smell when you shook his hand?
Sure did. But then, there was a light haze all through the Mountian Winery. And it's an outdoor stage.
Yep, he encourages it, I think.
Of course, I went to a John Prine concert where he was pounding Jack Daniels right on stage.
I don't think he does that any more.
He's still good though, I hear.
Yeah, he's at Red Rocks in June. Great venue.
Big, though. He's in Napa in October, that's where I'm going.
Everybody's seen Joey Cocker puke on stage. Not from smoking pot, man.
Isn't he dead now?
Yeah, but it wasn't drinking, it was smoking tobacco. Lung cancer.
Yeah, man, a great loss. I loved that guy.
Me too. Good stuff man, thanks.
