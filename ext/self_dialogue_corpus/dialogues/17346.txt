How do you feel about the new Deslondes album?
Hurry Home? I really love it!
It's a departure from their last one for sure.
I'm glad to see them growing as a band.
The surf influences are a fun touch, but I miss the country elements.
They're much more rock this time around.
Yeah, less folk or Americana.
Hurricane Shakedown is such a fun song though.
It's so upbeat and catchy.
I love how it's so influenced by New Orleans.
You can almost feel the heat and humidity in the music.
They're very good at creating a certain mood.
You're right. Even more so on this album than the last one.
I think this one is actually more cohesive than the last one.
I think you're right about that.
Some of the slower songs are really great too.
Deja Vu and a Blue Moon is amazing.
I know. I could listen to that one forever.
It's a good album for having a low key night.
I'm going to listen to it again tonight!
