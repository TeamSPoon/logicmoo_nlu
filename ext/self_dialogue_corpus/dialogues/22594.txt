did you see dead silence?
yeah, that movie scared me
not a fan of dolls, huh?
ive always been so freaked out by dolls
its the supernatural that scares me too
i dont care about slasher films
where people are just getting killed?
yeah, that doesnt do a thing for me
but dolls and puppets do>
yeah, ive never liked those things
i agree with you on that. im the same way.
horror loves making nice things evil
they make kids evil.
they make dolls and toys evil
just look at chuckie too
they wanna take the good out of everything
i get what you mean.
did you like dead silence though
it was alright.
it was scary so i guess it did the job
