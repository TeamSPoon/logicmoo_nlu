Okay, so what do you think was the worst part about the Phantom Menace?
Oh, man, just ONE worst part?  It's so hard to choose.. there's so many.
I know, I know, but for me, it had to be the  Midi-chlorians.
Oh, God, don't remind me of those.
Yeah, i mean, first film it establishes the Force as some kind of a mystical life force like "chi" or something that binds the universe and then.
And then it's all, "No, it's actually just a bunch of microscopic bugs."
Exactly! I really don't know what Lucas was thinking on that.
I hate to say it buuut...
Oh, go ahead.
I think he was just giving a giant middle finger to the audience.
