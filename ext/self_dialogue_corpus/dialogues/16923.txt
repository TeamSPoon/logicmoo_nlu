What's the most beautiful song you've ever heard?
Wow, that's kind of a big question. You mean the most beautiful one ever?
That comes to mind anyway.
Well a lot of classical music is really beautiful, like everything Mozart ever wrote for example.
Ok, but can you pick one out?
Probably not, and I think if we're talking about personally beautiful I'd have to go with "Music of Heaven".
I haven't heard that one. Who's it by?
It was written by Jason Robert Brown, for a singer and piano and orchestra/chorus.
What makes it the most beautiful.
Well I think a few things all added together. To start with the instrumentation in the opening is perfect.
Which instruments does it use?
It's piano and a couple of strings, maybe a violin, viola, and cello? It's very open and bare.
And that makes it beautiful?
The fact that there's so much space in the music lets you really hear what's going on.
Ok, I'm with you so far.
He has this really special way of using dissonance where unlike a lot of music that does the tension and release thing a lot of the time (like in the beginning of this song) the tension doesn't so much release as just fade.
I'm not sure I know what you mean.
Well if you listen, right after the singer sings "Let the music begin" the piano chords are dissonant, and they don't resolve. There's just silence.
Oh, so it doesn't go to the resolving chord. It just fades out and then something new starts?
Exactly! It's beautiful, and pulls you into the song.
