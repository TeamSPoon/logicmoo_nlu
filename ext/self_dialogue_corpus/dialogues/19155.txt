Do you remember the group LFO?
Yes I do, wow what an old group.
Yes, I was a kid when I used to listen to them.
What was there hit song?
Summer Girls.
Yes that is the one, I haven't heard that song in a long time.
Well you know who is another old group, N'SYNC.
Wow yes they are old, somedays I miss those boy bands.
What was your favorite N'SYNC song?
This I promise you was a good song.
Yes it was, and don't forget about bye bye bye.
I used to love that song too.
Me too, well at least we still have Justin Timberlake.
Very true, but its not the same as the boy band days.
I agree, I didn't really care for his song I'm Bringing Sexy Back.
Me either, maybe it is just hard to picture him outside of N'SYNC.
Maybe, but Cry Me A River was a decent song.
It wasn't bad.
Well maybe we should listen to some N'SYNC and compare.
Good idea.
