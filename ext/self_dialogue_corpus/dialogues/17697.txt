Do you like Harry Styles?
Ugh, no, why would I like boy band music?!
Well, actually his music isn't boyband music.
Uh, yes it is.
No, actually his new music is a varitey of genres.
Meaning what?
It's similar to a lot of 70's rock.
Really?
Yes.
Do you like it?
I like most of it.
I don't think I will listen to it.
You should give his music a try.
What is your favorite song of his?
Sign of the times.
Why do you like it?
It's very loud and bold.
Oh.
Yes, and it starts out with beautiful piano.
I do love piano.
