What was Leonardo DiCaprio's best performace?
I would say Titanic
No way
How so?
He was barely acting in that
Oh yeah forgot he was a poor Irishman
Its not that, its that hes played better roles in crappy movies too.
Like what?
Shutter Island!
That was a great movie
It had a twist everyone could see from a mile away.
I dont think thats true.
I think he did good in Growing Pains
No way, The Departed was good too.
I dont see the allure of him.
The academy doesnt see it that way
What about his latest?
Yeah that was probably his best role.
It wasnt but it finally got him over the hump.
Even i knew he was going to win that one.
