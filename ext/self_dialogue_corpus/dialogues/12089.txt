Who is you all time favorite star wars character?
I think yoda is up there for me. He is so wise and masterful.  What about you?
I love yoda, so quote worthy. but I have to go with han solo.
I like Han too. But why do you like him most?
I love his wit. I also love his one liners.
Very enjoyable character. Did you know that Harrison Ford was responsible for his response of "I KNOW"  to the I love you.
Yes, I did. I think that is such an iconic moment. Ford was really on the money. I think that may veen be my favorite line of Han solo's.
I agree, it is everything the character of Han is about. Ego, wit, charm.  I wonder if ford is upset Han died .
Maybe , but I think he is getting old and maybe knew he could not do it forever either.
I was glad he was alive to play the role and not have to make a substitute.
