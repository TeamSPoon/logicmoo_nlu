I watched that movie, Dead Silence, that you recommended me!
Did you like it!?
I did! It was really scary! How did you know dolls creeped me out?
Don't they creep everybody out?
Good point. That wall of ventriloquist dummies really freaked me out though!
The dead boy as a puppet is what really scared me!
That was really weird too. I was surprised at how they began the story too, they kind of jumped right in.
Oh, you mean with the death of the main guy's pregnant wife?
Yeah! Talk about jump scares!
Tell me about it! What a movie though.
