Do you like Disney movies?
I am a big fan.
I like the ones with animals as main characters.
Lasy and the Tramp was a favorite for me.
I almost forgot about that one.
When Lady and the mutt share the spaghetti - so romantic.
What about the Jungle Book with Baloo the bear?
I like the cartoon Baloo.
The new Jungle Book with CGI is pretty amazing.
The story is a bit different but I loved it.
