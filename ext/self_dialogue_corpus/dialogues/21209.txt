Did you the "Kong: Skull Island?"
Yes, did you?
Yes I did.
What did you think?
I thought it was a little lame.
Yeah, I thought it was pretty bad.
For me the whole premise of an island hidden in a giant storm was stupid.
Me too. What about all of the giant creatures?
Totally lame.
That giant spider was really stupid.
Those giant water buffaloes were a joke.
What about those weird creatures Kong was protecting everyone from?
Stupid! And the pilot that crashed there was lame too.
Yes, the Japanese and American pilots.
The Japanese pilot died.
I thought that boat they made from the p51 engine was dumb too.
Very lame, very lame.
Did you like any of the King Kong movies?
I liked the original one.
I liked the Mighty Joe Young movie.
