Do you remember the movie Identity?
Vaguely.  What was it about again?
This was the one where a bunch of strangers kept dying at a hotel in a storm.
Oh, okay, had John Cusack in it I think.
Right.  This is where you found that the characters didn't exist.
Yes, they were figments of the prisoners imagination.
Split personalities basically.  I thought it was a good plot device.
It was an interesting take on the film for sure.
In the end, I think the prisoner ends up still going crazy, doesn't he?
Yeah, crashes the van and kills some workers.
