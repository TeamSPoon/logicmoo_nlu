Did you know that the girl from Clerks died?
No! Which one?
Her real name is Lisa Spoonauer , she played Caitlin Bree in the movie.
Was Caitlin the girl that had sex with the dead guy in the movie?
Yes, the very same.
Do you know how she died?
According to People, she died of natural causes after suffering from an undisclosed chronic illness.
Wow. What a shame.
Yeah, she was only 44.
I can't believe that it was natural causes at that age.
Me either!
Was she ever in any other movies?
I don't know actually.
I'll check IMDB on my phone real quick.
What's it say?
Well, she was in Clerks, something called Bartender, and Clerks the TV series.
I wonder what she did between then and now.
According to  her Wikipage she was a restaurant manager and event planner.
Sooooo do wanna go watch Clerks?
Hell yes!
