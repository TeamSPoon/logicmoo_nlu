Hey what are the best actions movies that everybody should see?
I'd say the John Wick movies.
Yes, I can agree with that. Those films where fantastic.
Absolutely, you know how long it's been since a good old fashion action flick has come out with no special message?
What do you mean special message?
You know, like trying to be some kind of avdocate for something.
Like what?
Like women's rights, or LGTB, Race, Religion, etc.
What do you have against all that stuff?
Nothing, but it's annoying to see it in almost every film.
Yeah I'll admit there is a bit of an over satuaration in the majority of films out now.
Yes that is exactly my point. The John Wick movies didn't have any of that stuff in it and it was a breath of fresh air in my opinion.
I didn't look at it like that but now that you mention it I see what you mean.
I just hope they continue to make films like that in the future.
I can agree with that. It's nice to have unfiltered movies on the market.
Nice? It's a blessing to have movies like that on the market. The industry has way too much junk in it now.
I'm sure most people would agree with you. I jsut don't think anyone would really speak out about it.
The reason no one would say anything is because they don't want to be seen as some kind of anti "whatever group."
Yeah that is true.
If I could I'd send all directors a copy of John Wick with a letter saying "Take notes".
