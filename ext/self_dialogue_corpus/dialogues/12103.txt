What did you think of BB8? In the new Star Wars films?
I thought he was a cute little character.
Do you think they built him well, his plot lines I mean.
He is no R2-D2, but I think he played his part, to an extent.
Do you think he will be as important as R2 in the future?
I do not think so,  I mean come on even then R2 had the rest of the map.
Yes, but bb8 had some too.
Yes, maybe he will be the new cute R2D2.
Like a ewok, only a robot.
Yes, speaking of how about how ewoks are just mini wookies?
