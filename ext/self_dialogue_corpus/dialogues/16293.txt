Do you listen to heavy metal at all?
Nah -- I'm more of a prog-rock type of guy.
Yeah? Me too. Have you ever heard of prog-metal?
progressive metal?
Yeah.
No. That sounds like a contradiction in terms.
Well, beginning in the 1990s, heavy metal has been growing more sophistocated.
How so?
Metal bands are currently known for experimenting a lot with time signatures and achieving great levels of complexity and virtuosity.
Really? That sounds atypical for an American music genre.
Actually, heavy metal has become very popular in Europe lately, and most of the best bands are European.
No kidding. What are some examples?
My favorite band is actually from France, believe it or not. You would never know it from listening to it.
That's funny. What band is it?
They're called Gojira.
That sounds Japanese.
Gojira is the original Japanese pronunciation for Godzilla. It doesn't have anything to do with France, but the band liked the name anyway..
That's interesting. What do they sound like?
Gojira is definitely metal sounding. It's very loud and intense, and It has complexity and virtuosity of progressive rock.
That sounds kind of awesome actually.
