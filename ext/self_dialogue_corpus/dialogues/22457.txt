Imagine it is  the end of the world. Now imagine something worse
What is worse than the end of the world?
It Comes At Night.
Man, you are tickling my fancy with this. Why haven't I heard of this movie before now?
Beats me but it is centered on a teen aged boy  as he grapples with mounting terrors—external and otherwise—in the aftermath of an unnamed cataclysm.
Hoo baby I love a good fear makes people go crazy and do crazy stuff story.
Also seems like it's some kind of zombie type virus thing.
Zombies? What could be worse than zombies?
Yeah, the trailer is spooky good, atmospheric as all get out, and it has an interesting premise.
Sounds like some good stuff there. Looking forward to it.
It's just the right amount of uneasiness and uncertainty to keep you off balance.
Just enough to pull you in, then scare the bejesus out of you when the tension resolves?
Hopefully like a sledgehammer
I am a huge fan of the suspense it looks like this movie will bring.
