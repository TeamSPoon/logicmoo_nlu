Have you seen the new Beauty and the Beast film yet?
No, I haven't seen it yet. Have you?
Yeah I saw it in theaters a few weeks after it first came out.
What did you think?
I thought it was pretty good. Emma Watson was a good casting choice.
I always loved the original cartoon movie. Which did you think was better?
I think the cartoon was still better, but the new one is worth seeing.
I guess most remakes are never really as good as the original.
I agree, but it's still fun to see classic stories brought to life in new ways.
Good point. I think I'll rent the new Beauty and the Beast this weekend.
