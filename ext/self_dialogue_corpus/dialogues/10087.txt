...Marvin should have had an opinion.
What now?
Marvin. In Pulp Fiction. He should have had an opinion. That's why he died. He didn't have an opinion.
Yeah Vincent asks him if he thought "God came down and stopped those bullets" and..
..and Marvin says "man I ain't even got an opinion." This triggers Vincent to turn around to ask him again.
..gun in hand...casual conversation..
.."You got to have an opinion! You think that God came down and stopped..." Then bye bye to Marvin's Head.
...gone. One second. A bump in the road. Gone.
He should have just agreed with Vincent. Then Vincent doesn't turn around and shoot him in the face.
Yea, Marvin should have had an opinion.
