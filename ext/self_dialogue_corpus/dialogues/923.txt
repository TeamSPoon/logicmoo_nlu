Which state has the worst football team in the NFL would you say?
I don't know give me a minute
Well I think the Raiders  really have not been popular for a while
Why is that? Because they have the most losses or what ?
That, and possibly their players aren't too good.
It seem like if people like a certain NFL player, then they like the team as a whole
It just seems that they haven't been too popular
I agree. But have you been to one of their games?
Yes. And it was pretty good but they lost
They did? To whom.
The Dallas Cowboys of course
Yes well that's the best team
Maybe. But at least they need to develop a better strategy
Well thats the coaches job
Truely. If the team has a bad coach they wont be winning any games
Who is their coach ?
For the Oakland Raiders?
Yes. Is it still Jack Del Rio?
Yes I think it is.
Oh no wonder they are still losers. I don't think he's very good
