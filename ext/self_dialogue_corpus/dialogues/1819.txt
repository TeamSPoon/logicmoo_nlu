Hey, we have an open spot in our fantasy football league this year, do you want in?
Thanks, but I'm already in three long running leagues. Who do you like at QB this year?
I like Russell Wilson. He needs to take it all the way this year.
I'm sticking with Brady, I think he has one more ring in him.
In fantasy, I don't like to waste early picks on QB's. I also like Derek Carr and Jameis Winston.
QB's can rack up a lot of points, I also like Matt Ryan. What position do you pick first?
Wide outs, they also rack up a lot of points and most people don't look at them in the first rounds.
Good point. Who is on top of your list list year.
Mike Evans and Antonio Brown. The Steelers are def contenders this year.
Yeah, I like Odell and Julio Jones. Atlanta is looking good too.
You're right about that. They have a great D and Ryan has some awesome targets.
I'm so stoked it's almost time for preseason.  Who is your favorite running back.
I like Le'Veon Bell. Another reason why the Steelers could take home a ring.
I wish the Pats had more strength on the ground.
James White had better stay healthy.
We'll see. They got a couple of good backs in the draft.
What do you think of Dak Presscot?
I'm no Cowboys fan but that guy looks good.
I think Prescott could be a real diamond in the rough.
Tyrod Taylor is also going to turn some heads this year.
