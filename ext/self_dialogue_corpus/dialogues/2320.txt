Do you watch NFL football?
Of course. Football is my favorite sport.
I love the touchdown celebrations.
They get more creative every year.
I wonder who will show out this season. Cam Newton has been on it lately.
Cam has put dances on the map.
The NFL is cracking down on excessive celebrations.
I think they are entertaining and can fire a team up.
The CFL is different than the NFL. They are lenient and let multiple players celebrate.
The NFL should encourage it. It helps with ratings.
The spike was the first touchdown celebration.
Who invented it?
Honer Jones way back in 1965.
You know the Redskins were the first to perform group high-fives.
I did not know that. These celebrations are so common today.
I use to love when Aaron Rodgers did the championship belt moves.
That was cool. When they won the Superbowl he was given a big championship belt.
Rodgers was able to turn that into a commercial with State Farm.
I wonder what the hot celebration dance will be this year.
There is no telling. Players get more creative every season.
