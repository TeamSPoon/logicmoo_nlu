Did you watch Disney movies as a child?
Yes, I used to watch "The Wonderful World of Disney" on tv.
So did I!  I remember it came on Sunday nights right after "Wild Kingdom."
I used to get excited when the graphic of Cinderella's castle popped up with Tinkerbell flying around.  You knew something fun was about to happen.
Yes, me too.  What were some of your favorites?
Well, "Cinderella", of course, and some of the live action movies like "Escape to Witch Mountain."  How about you?
I loved "Cinderella" too, and I remember seeing "Escape to Witch Mountain" at the theater.  What was the first Disney movie you saw at the theater?
I think maybe it was "The Rescuers."  It's hard to remember that far back.  Which was the first you saw?
I think it was "Alice in Wonderland."  I remember going after dance practice, and we were a bit late and missed the first part.  But that was back when you could stay for the second showing, so we stayed and watched again.
That sounds fun.  What great memories.
