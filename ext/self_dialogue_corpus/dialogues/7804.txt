Have you seen any of the Harry Potter movies?
Of course!  My favorite is The Goblet of Fire.
Really?  Why?
Well, I think it was the most adventurous.  It was action paced, but kept itself grounded in the familiar territory of the kids at school.
I guess I understand that.  I really like The Order of the Phoenix.
Why?
The exact opposite of your reason--it gets the movie away from school and more into the actual world of wizardry.
Huh.  I understand.
I like them all, I mean.  But that one is my favorite.
I like them all too.
