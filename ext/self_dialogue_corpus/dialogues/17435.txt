What do you think of the band One Direction?
I think they are kind of bad for a boy band.
True, their songs are super repetitive.
I know you must like them since you mentioned.
I know, some of their songs are actually good.
Like which ones?
Midnight Memories, The story of our Lives and Rock Me.
I have never heard of them. I only know That's What Makes you Beautiful.
Oh right! That's their first ever hit.
Can you believe I thought that was the band Big Time Rush the first time i heard?
Wow, thats funny. I thought they didn't exist anymore.
Yeah, I'm not familiar with boy bands like that.
I wish One Direction would mature their sound a bit.
What would you want to hear?
More of a rock sound, less pop.
Like Harry Style's solo work?
Yes, exactly like that!
He sounds exactly like Queen.
I think its pretty superb.
Totally!
