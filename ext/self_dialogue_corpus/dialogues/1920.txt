So what do you think of Roger Goodell?
Well everyone seems to hate him, so I guess I'm initially not too favorable towards him.
Yeah, he definitely takes a beating in the media, and it's always fun to see him get booed at the NFL draft.
Yup. But why is he so hated?
I don't think most people actually have specific reasons for hating him - but I know many were upset about how he has handled the Ray Rice scandal.
Yeah that was shameful. Ray Rice knocked her out cold. That was disgusting.
Yeah, and he's still trying to come back into the NFL, but with no success.
Yeah that would be a PR nightmare for whoever would sign him.
Well, Adrian Peterson was forgiven.
I mean, that's barely the same thing. But yeah I guess maybe Ray Rice's play has something to do with it too.
Yeah I think if you can still produce, someone in the NFL will give you a job. Look at PacMan Jones, he's still around.
Wow, I guess he is, but he isn't in the news as much anyone
I guess that's a good thing for him though, right? Haha where's he even playing these days? Cincy?
Ha, Cincy would make sense and I think that's right.
That Cincinnati team seems infamous for having players who get in trouble.
Like who else?
Well they drafted Chris Henry back in the day. Chad Johnson. And now they draft Joe Mixon!
Wow. They really did take Mixon didn't they. That's nuts. However Chad Johnson, or should I Say OchoCinco, wasn't a bad guy. He just got fined a lot.
Yeah I guess youre right, which brings us back to Goodell. I think he shouldn't fine people for celebrating.
Yeah he must think NFL stands for the 'no fun league'
