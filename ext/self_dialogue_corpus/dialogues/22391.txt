You're a fan of WWE wrestling, right? Did you see that movie The Marine 5?
No, I haven't seen it yet. Why, is there a wrestler in it?
Yeah, there's a bunch of them in it. The Miz and his wife Maryse, Naomi, and one or two others.
Oh I love The Miz and Maryse. They're hilarious! What characters do they play in the movie?
The Miz is a military EMT who gets caught up in some warfare, he's the main character of the entire movie.
Oh I see. How was his performance?
It was mediocre. He wasn't really as engaging as he is in wrestling promos.
That's kind of normal though, especially for a movie that's in its fifth sequel already. You can't expect much.
You're right. But the movie isn't all that bad. It's better than the previous ones, except for the first one.
The first one hard John Cena in it, didn't it?
Yeah, he's another big wrestler who has gone to Hollywood, just like Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson.
I'm kind of sick of The Rock. He's in almost every single blockbuster movie these days.
Yeah, he's the Fast and Furious franchise, he did Central Intelligence with Kevin Hart, and so many others.
Now he's doing the Baywatch remake with Zach Efron.
That actually looks kind of funny. I was thinking of seeing that.
Maybe it's funny, if you like hearing some more jokes about The Rock's muscles.
Anyway back to the Marine 5, Maryse isn't in it much, she's really just in the beginning.
Who is she in the movie? And what about Naomi?
Maryse is a girl who is trapped in a car accident, and The Miz rescues her. Naomi just plays a bartender, I think.
Lame.
