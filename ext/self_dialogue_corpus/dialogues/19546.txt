Would you say you have pretty eclectic musical taste?
Yes, definitely. I listen to all kinds of music from classical and jazz to Heavy metal and hip-hop.
Do you like progressive rock?
If you mean stuff like Pink Floyd and Emerson Lake and Palmer then yes. Is that your favorite kind of music?
Yes, I suppose most of the stuff I listen to is progressive rock, but I am also pretty eclectic in my tastes as well.
I'm always on the lookout for some new stuff to listen to. What other progressive rock bands are there?
There are a ton of progressive rock bands, but people don't tend to know about them because they don't get played on the radio as much.
I see. What are some examples of this?
Well, some really good bands that you never hear on the Radio are Gentle Giant, Happy the man and Camel.
Why do you think they never get played on the Radio?
To be honest, I'm not sure why. I think that when radio stations play songs from several decades ago they only play the ones that were at the top of the charts at some point.
And those bands never had number-one hits on the charts?
Right, although their music is very creative and even sophistocated. I think it takes a more seasoned musical taste to appreciate it.
I get sick of hearing the same hit songs over and over. I like to find obscure groups that are very good, although not well known.
My feeling exactly.
What do you think makes Gentle Giant a good band?
The music has a very unique sound. The vocal style is troubadorial, while the instrumentals are very complex and jazz-influenced.
That's hard to imagine. I suppose I won't really understand until I hear it.
A lot of the progressive rock music from the early seventies has a distinctly jazz-influenced sound. You could almost call it jazz-rock fusion.
That's very true.
