The Senators play again tonight.
Do you know when the Rangers play again?
I think they play on the road tomorrow.
I'm not getting a good feeling about their chances on the road.
Yeah, I think they weren't even that good before they made that trade.
Yeah, they didn't even get much in return that they could use right now.
I think they're preparing for next year, to be honest.
Yeah, I don't know why teams are willing to give up on a season like that.
It seems like they aren't concerned about the fans who invested this year.
Do you think they will even have the same coach next year?
I'm pretty sure they won't blame this year on Girardi.
Yeah, how can all those injuries be his fault?
Exactly, plus they're young.
True, they should be fine at most positions next year.
I think they could use a good closer though.
I think they have a really good one in triple-A right now.
Do you think he would be ready to come up for next year?
I think he could be ready now, honestly.
I think they could use him now.
I think he could be too young and could get hurt like the other players.
