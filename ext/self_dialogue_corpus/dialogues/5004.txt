I cant believe it man.
You can't Believe what?
The Spurs are looking so much better on the floor. With Kawhi Leonard out I thought for sure they'd lose.
Well they are the spurs afterall. Do you think they can take it all the way?
Yeah I do, Golden State looks good too but something about this Spurs team has me.
I don't know. Golden State looks like they're super hungry this year.
As long as Kawhi comes back and can play defense and Aldridge can have a solid game I think we have a good shot.
Cleveland may also be a nuissance to them before the warriors.
Yeah... I forgot about the cavaliers.
How can you forget Lebron James?
I feel like Kawhi is the new LBJ.
Youre crazy man.
It's always dangerous business underestimating the Spurs, as the Rockets just found out.
I mean yeah but cmon we are talking about two of the greatest teams.
San Antonio could be a challenge  to Golden State by winning the battle in the paint, and clearing boards.
Thats true with gasol and alridge.
Pretty much just need to focus on stopping steph and klay.
Kevin durant is still there.
Yeah KD is a different animal he can score on anyone, I just hope he has a few off days.
Keep hoping. Kd doesnt play like that.
