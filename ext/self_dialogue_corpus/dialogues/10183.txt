Did you see James Cameron may be redoing RoboCop?
No theres no way that can be true.
The movie was not that bad.
Yeah but I dont think he wants to go down that road
He usually does write novel type of movies.
Yeah I loved RoboCop too
They had great fight scenes.
It was really simple for its time
Yet was able to captivate audiences with the various ways they did effects.
I just think you leave it alone, it wasnt a supreme movie enough to get a director back like that
