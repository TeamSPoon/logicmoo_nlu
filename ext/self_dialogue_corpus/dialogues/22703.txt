What is your favorite genre of movie?
That's a good question. I would say horror.
What is your favorite horror movie?
I would have to say The Babadook.
Wow, sounds like a weird movie.
It is, want to know what its about?
Yeah sure, tell me.
Its about a mysterious thing that keeps terrorizing a woman and her son.
That sounds really freaky.
Well, the ending makes it look like its not so bad.
Like it ended up not even being evil?
It's hard to explain, but that's kind of it.
Sounds like a really intricate plot.
Oh, it is. The being is basically there because of the families trauma with losing the husband/father.
So its like a figment of their imagination?
I think so, but its hard to tell.
And why is that?
Because there are weird scenes in the movie, like at the end they feed the thing worms.
Haha, that sounds really creepy.
It definitely is, you should check it out.
