Yea, there are a lot of good teams in the NFL now.
Yea, many have a shot. Some of the same ones and some new ones.
Yea, theres a few teams lately that think they can win with just defenses.
Yea, I know exactly who you are thinking of.
Yea, Denver and Houston. What are they doing?
I mean, I know defense is important, but you need a quarterback.
Yea, can you tell those teams that.
Yea, especially Houston. I mean, I guess they tried and struck out with Osweiler, didn't they?
Yea, the joke is on them for that one.
I guess that was one smart decision that the Broncos made. Letting him walk.
Yea, that was one contract there were fortunate enough to not have given out.
Yea, that was a tough one. Not a good deal for Houston.
Well, yea and now they still have to find a quarterback.
I agree! Its hard to win without one.
Yea, even with that stellar defense.
Yea, thats not usually enough if you do not have a quarterback.
Yea, Denver won it all with subpar quarterback play, but that was still Payton Manning.
Exactly! At least he still brought something to the table.
Yea, he had leadership qualities.
Yea, that goes a long way toward winning as well.
