Did you ever see "On the Waterfront?"
Was that the one with Marlon Brando?
My favorite movie is Casablanca.
Oh, I just adore Humphrey Bogart. Such a tough guy.
How many times did you see Titanic?
Oh, lord, I must have seen it 20 times. That ship sank every time.
My favorite musical was Chicago.
It was good, but Richard Gere is not the best singer.
I still enjoy watching The Wizard of Oz.
That wicked witch is so frightening!
The longest movie I ever watched was Gone with the Wind.
Yes, it's the only movie I know with an intermission.
Did you ever see Poseidon adventure?
I did--the first ever disaster movie!
Towering Inferno was not very good.
I know, Fred Astaire should have retired before doing that one.
My kids loved 101 Dalmations.
The animated version, or the one with real people?
The Incredibles just cracked me up.
I know, the kids were fantastic with their powers, especially Jack Jack.
