Have you seen any good movies lately?
Yes, I saw Wonder Woman just last weekend.
What was it like?
It was a typical super hero movie in some ways but it also went into  Diana's backstory.
Really? What is her backstory?
Well apparently she was a child of the gods who was created as a weapon against evil.
I never heard that before. I thought she was an Amazon.
She is an Amazon princess and grew up on a secret island with her mother.
Okay, that's more like the story I know. What was different about that in the movie?
The island was deliberately hidden by the gods so that mankind and their evil ways couldn't touch it.
So how did Diana end up leaving the island?
That scene was one of my favorites in the whole movie. A plane crashed just off the coast of the island.
So who was in the plane?
It was Chris Pine's character, Steve Trevor. Diana rescued him from drowning.
So she couldn't get back once she left?
No, she took him to the island and the soldiers who were after him came to the island too. They fought with the Amazons.
So she never left the island? I mean except to rescue Steve?
Yes, she left with him to go and try to stop the war that Steve was fighting in.
Well how did it end?
I'm not going to tell you! You have to go see it for yourself!
