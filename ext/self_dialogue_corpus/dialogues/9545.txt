This is a trip! I just seen the BIGGIE Movie last night. Did you see Tupac's?
No I haven't but it looks so good.
Yes, I love old rap and hip hop. I'm Naughty by Nature, not cause I hate cha.
Look at Ice Cube, just seen him in a hilarious movie called Fist Fight.
Snoop Dogg will always be the dogfather.
Heelyeah. I loved Warren G and Mace.
Are they still alive?
I have no idea bro. R.I.P Tupac and Biggie.
Do you like the new age rap hip hop?
Oh no, it's not good and they rip off so many old riffs.
