You ever hear of Devin Townsend?
nah, what band is he in?
He used to be in Strapping Young Lad - really popular industrial metal band from the early 2000s.
Oh word, that sounds familiar. Didn't they break up?
Yeah, he wanted some creative distance from such an angry outlet so he started a solo career.
What kind of stuff does he make now then?
He dabbles in alot of genres - alot of melancholic rock in his early career but now he does ambient stuff, a country album, prog rock...
oh wow, reminds me of Ween a bit then. Alot of genre-hopping...
Yeah, that's accurate. He has some consistency between projects though so they blend together really well.
So should I start at the beginning with him then?
Definitely. Start with Ocean Machine - it's really heavy and sludgy and the best entry point.
Word. And I should just go chronologically from there?
I think so, his career has a specific trajectory that comes to light if you follow it from the beginning. If you dive in at the end it'll seem really strange.
Strange how? Because of the cross-genre approach?
Well yes, but right now for instance he just finished a space opera starring puppets, and is going from that to a symphony.
Oh wow, so it's a little tricky to figure out what the heck is going on unless I follow his work from the beginning?
Yeah exactly - he has alot of recurring themes and in-jokes in his work that make his chaotic later output make way more sense.
Gotcha, so listen to his stuff chronologically and pay attention to how things progress. What's the reward in all of it?
You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll scream - it's some of the craziest, most passionate, and inspirational music out there today.
Haha well alright then, I'll get started now.
