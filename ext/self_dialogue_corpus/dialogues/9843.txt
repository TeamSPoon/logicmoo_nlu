Hey man, have you listened to Drake's new album?
No man! I don't listen to that garbage!
What are you talking about? Drake is alright. What, are you not a fan of his?
Nah man. I don't listen any of that new junk! The golden age of rap is dead!
Oh really, so what do you listen to then?
I only stick to the classics. Nowadays, everybody is sellin' out!
Do you have any artists in particular who you would say are the best?
Most people would respond with someone like Tupac or Biggie, but personally, I think MC deserves a spot among one of the greats!
You can't be serious man! That one-hit-wonder?
Hey man, if you can't appreciate his genius I see no reason to continue this conversation.
