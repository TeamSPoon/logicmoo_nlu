Have you heard of the new Transformers movie that's coming out?
No I haven't, what is the name of it?
It's Transformers: The Last Knight and is directed by Michael Bay.
Awesome, I hope this one lives up to the hype from the rest of them.
Me too, the last couple of movies that Michael Bay put out have been hit or miss.
Ya but they action in them have still been good. I have high expectations for this movie.
Why is that? The last one that came out was a disappointment for me.
I think that Mark Wahlberg will do another good job of acting in this movie. Michael Bay does make good movies at times.
You're right, I will go into this movie with an open mind and hopefully the movie turns out good.
Awesome! I look forward to seeing it with you when it comes out.
