Do you follow the National Football League?
Yes, I do. Do you?
Yes, I do. What's your favorite team?
I like the Arizona Cardinals.
I like the Seattle Seahawks.
I enjoy the rivalry between the two teams.
I do as well. They tied last year.
Yes, they did. I enjoyed that game very much.
It was a game of incompetence.
I agree, but it was still a good game.
The first ended in a tie.
Yes, and the Cardinals won the second.
Do you think the Cardinals will win the West this year?
I don't know. It's Larry's last year.
Who is Larry?
Larry Fitzpatrick. The wide receiver.
He's a Hall-Of-Fame player.
Yes, I believe so.
Do you think they will do well for his last year?
I hope so, yes. They should.
