Do you like the Harry Potter movies?
Definitely!  They were so well done.
I know, I loved the soundtrack.  I read the books and couldn't wait for the movies.
Yeah, they definitely did the books justice.  I can't believe what a good job Daniel Radcliffe did when the movies first started.
I know, he was so young and yet did such an incredible job acting.
It was interesting to sort of watch them grow up on screen too.
Definitely.  What was your favorite movie in the series?
Honestly, I really enjoyed the Goblet of Fire the most.  I thought the storyline with the game was really intriguing.
Yeah, that was definitely one of the best.
For sure.
