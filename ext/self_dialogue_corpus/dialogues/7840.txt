I just finished Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix.
What did you think of Umbridge?
I hated her.
She definitely deserved what she got.
I liked the scene where Fred and Georgia just fly out during the middle of their exams.
The fireworks they chase Umbridge with are so cool.
I also though the ending was pretty sad.
Sirius Black is one of my favorite characters
I wish he could've spent more time with Harry.
At least he died laughing and trying to protect Harry.
