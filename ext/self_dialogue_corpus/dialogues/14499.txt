Did you see that Spurs and Warriors game last night?
I watched part of it.... Warriors just rolled over San Antonio!
Yea, looks like they are on the verge of a sweep.
I don't know, remember what happened last year to the warriors in the finals.
True, but this is a different team.
We will see!
The playoffs suck this year anyway
Yup too many injuries
I mean the Celtics are just embarrassing
I wonder how they'd be doing if they had Isaiah Thomas healthy
I think Cavs would still take it but it would have been a little more competitive
I guess we will never know
Well at least the Celtics have the first draft pick
This is true but some are saying they may trade it away
Did you see how the Mavs tanked at the end of the season
Yea why is everyone talking about it now?
I know right, it's like no sh*t sherlock, everyone saw that
I wonder if they are going to do anything next year
I can't believe Dirk is still playing
I think next season will be his last.
