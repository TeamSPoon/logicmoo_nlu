What is your favorite disney movie?
There are many to choose from, but when I was a kid I loved Robin Hood.
Why is that?
Baloo and Little John were the same voice actor, Phil Harris, and he was the funniest character to me.
Didn't Robin Hood use some of the same animation as the Jungle Book? Why not the Jungle Book?
The Jungle Book is great too, but the action and humor in Robin Hood was better in my opinion.
I guess that makes sense. Theres no stagecoach robbing or storming of a castle in the Jungle Book.
What about you? What was your favorite Disney movie?
I like the female empowerment of Mulan.
Good call. She was very self-reliant.
