Do you want to go see Beauty and The Beast this weekend?
Yes, I saw it last week, but I'd love to see it again.
Is it really that good?
Absolutely! The imagery is breathtaking!
I heard it was really good, and I just love Emma Watson.
Me too.
Was it comparable to the cartoon version?
I actually think it was even better.
Really?
Yes!
Wow. I can't wait.
I'm happy they waited until they had the technology to redo this one.
Oh yeah, if they had done it even 2 years ago, it would be clunky and silly.
For sure!
So how does the Beast look after he transforms?
Don't you want to wait to see the movie?
I'm just curious if he's actually cute, because in the cartoon, he looked kind of like a tool.
So you preferred him a Beast?
Oh yeah, I preferred Beast.
Well, all I'll say is that it is REALLY similar to the cartoon.
