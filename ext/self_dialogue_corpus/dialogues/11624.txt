Who's your favorite Beatle?
Oh, that question is as old as time!
I know. I can't say I really have one.
Me neither. Would George Martin count as an option?
I guess he could!
What about the drummer they had before Ringo. 'Pete,' somebody i think.
Good point. Technically he was a Beatle
Obviously Paul and John were equally gifted and prolific
But George wrote a ton of good stuff too.
Absolutely, He just wrote significantly less masterpieces than they did, ha!
