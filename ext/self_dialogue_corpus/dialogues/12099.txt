What is your favorite Star Wars movies out of the prequel trilogy?
It is definitely Revenge of the Sith!
I think that was the only good movie in the sequel trilogy!
It is! Definitely better than the previous two.
What was your favorite scene?
It was when Obi Wan Kenobi was yelling at Anakin Skywalker when he was near the lava.
That scene was so emotional!
I know, it made me tear up a little.
Obi Wan Kenobi sounded so heart broken.
It was hard to watch but so worth it!
