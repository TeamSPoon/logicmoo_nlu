Have you seen any good movies lately? I'm tired of watching Moana with my little one.
I've been watching a lot of classic movies recently. I was watching Breakfast at Tiffany's last night.
I've never heard of that one. Who is in it?
Audrey Hepburn. She's a party girl living in New York.
Sounds interesting. What other movies has she been in?
Sabrina, Roman Holiday, and My Fair Lady.
I've seen that one. I watched it  when I was little.
Yeah, it's a musical but she isn't the one doing the singing.
I didn't know that.
The real singer's name was Marni Nixon. They used her in a lot of musicals.
That's crazy! I'm not a big fan of musicals though.
I love them but I also love to watch the old westerns.
I've watched some John Wayne movies with my dad. They are pretty cool I guess.
The Searchers has always been my favorite of his. I also like True Grit.
I've seen that one. That's when he's helping that kid find who killed her dad.
I also like The Cowboys, but it is really sad.
Why is it sad?
He dies in that one. It always made me cry when I was little.
That does sound sad. I'll have to find some more of his movies to watch.
You should! He made so many films.
