What city is the best NFL city?
Wow, that's a good question.
I personally think it's Dallas.
Naw, Dallas has to many bandwagon fans.
I'm not talking about the Cowboys but the city they play in.
Well technically the Dallas Cowboys play in Arlington, Texas not Dallas.
Ok, what do you think is the best NFL city?
I think it's Chicago.
Why Chicago?
They have great fans and love the team.
So do the Cowboys fans.
Chicago fans still support the team even when they suck.
I guess Dallas fans don't have to do that since the Cowboys are usually good.
Here, how about Buffalo.
That town isn't a good NFL city.
Those fans support that team no matter what.
I guess that's true.
What's the worst NFL city?
That's easy it's Los Angeles.
I agree Los Angeles has terrible fans.
