The Trailblazers have a bright future ahead of them
Yeah I believe this organization is going in the right direction
I mean that backcourt is already one of the best in the league
Mccullom and Damian Lilliard are almost unstoppable.
I love watching both of these guys play
Especially when they are both in a groove at the same time.
Now that they have their center of the future, it's going to be interesting.
I just hate that Nurkic got hurt before the playoffs.
Me too. I would have loved to see what he could have done against the Warriors
For sure. But they will definitely be a fun team to watch next year
Indeed. The western conference is so competitive it's still going to be hard for them to improve
Yeah I mean everyone in the West seems to get better every year.
With that being said if they can play better on defense this team could leapfrog some others
Right. They were one of the hottest teams down the stretch last year.
For sure. They are a tough team to play at their house
I love the energy of that crowd. Something about those fans really pumps me up
They do have a great crowd and arena.
Yeah that place is always rocking
Maybe they can get it back to the Clyde Drexler Portland days.
Wouldn't that be phenomenal!
