Can you help me answer some questions for a music project?
Sure what's it for?
I'm writing a paper for my music class.
What do you need to know?
What's your favorite music genre?
Probably Pop.
Why is that your favorite genre?
Not really sure, but it's on the radio and I like catchy tunes.
What's your least favorite genre of music?
Probably rap.
Why is that your least favorite?
I don't care much for the lyrics, and mostly listen for melodies. Rap tends to skimp on those.
Okay final question. Who's your favorite musical artist?
I like Carrey Underwood the best.
Nice I like her music a lot too
Yeah she always has very positive messages, and her music is always beautiful
I think so also.
Is that everything you need?
Yep. This is going to help my paper.
Awesome. Glad I could help.
