Which new albums are you looking forward to?
I'm very excited about the new Clientele album.
It's been a long time since they put out an album.
Yeah, I think it's been about 7 years or so.
They're a great band. Their quality level has been quite consistent over the years.
Yeah, you can't say that about a lot of bands.
I'm looking forward to the new Vince Staples album. It's called Big Fish Theory.
Yeah, I wanna hear that one too. It comes out tomorrow, right?
Right. I think he keeps getting better and better.
I agree. He seems to be hitting his stride now.
He's also really great in interviews.
He's obviously very smart and he's super funny.
I like watching Mac DeMarco in interviews as well.
He doesn't seem as real as Vince though. Mac seems to be hiding something.
What do you mean?
I feel like Mac acts a certain way in public, but in his private life he's probably quite depressed and lonely.
I can kinda see that. The hints are there.
Yeah, his music has that sort of sad, lonely quality to it.
Regardless though, I enjoy his music and his interviews.
I do too, but I'd like to learn more about what he's really like.
