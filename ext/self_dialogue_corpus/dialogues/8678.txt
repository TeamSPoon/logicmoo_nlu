hey, I'm so old I remember the advent of punk music in America.
No kidding. that is old! Did you listen to Sid Vicious and stuff?
I didn't know.  There was one kid in my school who was into the Clash, and everyone was confused.
I could imagine.  Most people were into metal in those days.
Yes, I liked all the "hair bands" back then.  i was a big fan of Def Leppard.
I loved Motley Crue and Ratt, especially "Round and round."
I remember David Lee roth in the "jump" video.  He literally jumped around.
That was when MTV was music TV.  Wow, you are old.
That is true.  But these days, I still like old classics like Zeppelin and Twisted Sister.
Well, i'm going to go listen to some Metallica;s "enter sandman" now.
