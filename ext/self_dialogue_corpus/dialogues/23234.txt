remember the pokemon movie
which one are we talking about?
the first one with mewtwo
that was a classic. that movie was so good
remember pikachu crying?
yeah, it was such a weird movie
ash got turned to stone
and then strangely tears brought him back to life
mewtwo doesnt even have an attack like that
he is like medusa
maybe its just how attacks are to humans
but pokemon attack humans all the time
thats true. pikachu did that to ash a alot
and charzard blew fire in his face
yeah, charzard was a jerk
charard was on ashs side in the movie though
yeah, he was right behind him for support
ash was brave but stupid
yeah, he couldnt have thought he could punch mewtwo
mewtwo is way too powerful
