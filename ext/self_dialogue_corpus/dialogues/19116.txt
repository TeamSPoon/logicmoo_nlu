Who's your least favorite band?
Nickelback!
No, that doesn't count. Everyone hate's Nickelback.
Touche. Then I'd say Muse.
Awww snap. Yeah they suck. What ever happened to them?
Probably everyone collectively realized what we already knew- that they're horrible.
Didn't they release like an electronic album?
Yep, I think so. There was that one song I heard over and over and over again.
The "m-m-m-mad mad mad" one?
I think it was called "Madness". Brilliant. Just beautiful stuff Muse.
True art. Did you like any of their early stuff though?
Well... now that I think about it... nope.
Yeah, no. They're horrible.
I feel like they were aiming to be U2 or something, I don't even know. It's like they heard "Vertigo" one time and decided that's what every song was gonna feel like.
Kinda, yeah. Or maybe they were contemporaries of Radiohead and were trying to ride their success wave.
Maybe. Either way, I just downright hate 'em.
And so our musical taste remains identical.
It does
One day we'll disagree about a band.
Probably not.
