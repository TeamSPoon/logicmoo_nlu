I can't wait for NFL games again.
Me too! Pre-season starts next month.
The Bucs should have a good year.
I don't know about that. Doug Martin's suspension could hurt them.
They are stacked with Running Backs and Martin will be back once the suspension is over.
That is true.
Charles Sims is back from his injury to lead the Backs.
Who do you think will start?
Jaquizz Rodgers showed promise last season but I think Sims will get the nod.
The Bucs were hammered with injuries last year.
They will have a good group of receivers this season.
Did they draft any receivers?
They drafted OJ Howard from Alabama.
That is a good pick.
Combine him with Mike Evans and Winston has two great targets.
They still have Vincent Jackson too.
He is getting older and playing less but Adam Humphries doubles as a receiver and tight end.
If they can get past the Atlanta Falcons they might own their division.
That's the plan. I can't wait to watch all the games.
I might go to a couple in person.
