Have you been to any baseball games recently?
No, I haven't gone since i was a kid.
I always loved going to games with my dad.
Yeah, those were good times.
There was a certain excitement to seeing your favorite players, even if if was from far away.
Sitting in a large stadium you could feel the energy and excitement in the air.
Did you ever eat any ballpark food?
Yeah, I would get cotton candy and hot dogs.
They were overpriced, but my dad would buy them anyway.
I haven't had ballpark food in years, but I'm sure the smell and taste would come back to me if I was around it now.
Did you ever catch any foul balls?
No, but came close a couple of times.
Did you see any homeruns?
A few.
One Reds game I went to, a player hit a homerun and batted in two other players.
That must have been pretty cool.
It was.
Do you watch the Reds on TV?
Yes, sometimes. When they're on a losing streak i'm not so inclined to watch.
Yeah, why do that to yourself?
