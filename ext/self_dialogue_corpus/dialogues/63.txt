Did you ever see Captain America?
I've seen it once or twice.
Did you like it?
More than most other superhero type movies.
Why do you say that?
I don't know.  I think a lot of it was the setting.
Yeah, it all started back in the 40s.
Yeah, it was different than most of those movies.
There was still enough action.
Yeah, so it still makes people wanted the action happy.
