what was your favorite star wars battle?
definitely not obi vs vader
that was so stupid and short.
anakin vs obi was so much better.
vader just killed obi with hardly any effort.
obi was too old at that point.
say that to yoda.
yoda isnt a human being though.
yoda is a god.
probably not that though.
