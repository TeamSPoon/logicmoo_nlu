Do you know many bands from Seattle?
Quite a few actually. What kind of music are you interested in?
Rock music! I love vintage rock music.
In that case, you would probably love bands like Nirvana, Soundgarden, and Pearl Jam.
All of those bands are from Seattle?
They sure are. They were part of the grunge scene.
That's amazing. And they all rose to fame around the same time?
Correct. All of these bands had a lot of success and radio play.
I know Nirvana well, but I'll have to learn more and listen to Soundgarden and Pearl Jam.
Black Hole Sun is my favorite Soundgarden song. You should check it out.
