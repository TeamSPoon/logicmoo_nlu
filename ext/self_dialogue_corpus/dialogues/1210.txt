Who's the other player that won 5 superbowls?
Charles Haley
I don't even klnow who that is
He was a linebacker and defensive end. Played for the 49ers and the cowboys.
Huh. And he won superbowl with 2 different teams?
yep, twice with the 49ers, and 3 times with the cowboys
i wonder how common that is? Winning the superbowl playing for multipl,e teams.
Not common. Peyton Manning is the very first QB to win the superbowl playing for two different teams.
That kinda makes sense, the reason for trade is because your performance goes down
Yeah. There have been other QBs who went to the superbowl playing for more than one team, however.
Like who?
Kurt Warner and Craig Morton. Morton didn't win any, while Warner won 1.
They should keep track of all the players who do that, not just QBs. Like in a database.
That database would be cool to have.
My point exactly.
WEll at least we have the info for the QBs, and that's better than nothing.
Brady went to the superbowl 7 times!
And won 5.
So he went to the superbowl more than anyone. and won the superbowl more than anyone
Yep, but he also lost 2, so his percentage of winning the superbowl isn't as high as Bradshaw or Montana who both went to the superbowl 4 times and won all 4.
