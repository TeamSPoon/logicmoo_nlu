I am in the mood to listen to some classic country songs.
That sounds fun, are you talking about really old music?
Not that old, maybe songs from the eighties and nineties.
There were a lot of great country songs released during that time span.
I know! George Strait put out some great music during that period.
Would you consider him your favorite country musician?
He is up there, it would have to be him or Alan Jackson.
Alan Jackson is very talented in his own right.
He sure is! I love that song Small Town Southern Man.
I do not think I have ever heard that one before.
Really? I will definitely have to let you listen to it then!
Great, what other ones from him do you enjoy?
Remember When, Drive, and Livin' On Love are all great songs.
I agree, those three I am very familiar with.
He has consistently put out great music over the years.
What about George Strait? Which of his songs do you like?
Check Yes Or No, Carrying Your Love With Me, as well as I cross My Heart; I love those three!
Have you ever heard any Randy Travis songs?
Yes, I love that song Forever and Ever Amen.
That is a wonderful song for sure. Classic country music has a couple of friends in us!
