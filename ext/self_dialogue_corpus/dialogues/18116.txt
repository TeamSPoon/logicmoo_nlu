What do you think about Justin Bieber?
I don't really care for him, but I don't really care about him at all.
Do you think he is overrated?
I don't know.  I'm not a fan, but I don't think he's horrible.
You think he actually has talent.
I think he does, but he has a crappy attitude.
At least we are on the same wavelenghth on that.
Yeah, he just needs to grow up.
How old is he now?
I'm guessing he has to be in his mid-twenties.
See?  And the guy still acts like a little kid.
Yeah, it's a shame because I think he does have a bit of talent.
Do you think he'd ever be able to get farther than he is in the business?
If he starts taking it seriously, then yeah.  There's a lot of twenty five year olds that decide to grow up and get real.
I don't know.  He doesn't seem like that kind of guy.
I agree with you.
It seems all he likes to do is party.
He really needs to diversify.
What do you mean?
Well, he needs to be more businesslike and invest and play smart.  His fans aren't going to love him forever.
