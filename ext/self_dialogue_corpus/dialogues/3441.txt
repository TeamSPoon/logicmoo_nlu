Are you a Vincent Price fan?
Yes absolutely. He is great in all of his movies.
Did you see the original House on Haunted Hill?
Yes, it was great.
William Castle directed that movie.
Yeah and he was involved with Rosemary's Baby too.
That is a great movie.
Yeah, Rosemary's Baby might be the best horror movie of all time.
It is definitely up there with The Exorcist and The Shining.
Yes, horror was great in the 70's.
