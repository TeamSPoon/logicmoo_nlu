what's your favorite artist?
I'm a big fan of Eminem.
Do you like his newer stuff, or his older stuff?
His orginal Slim Shady stuff is full of my favorites.
What about his newer stuff?
Rap God is a fantastic song.
Is that's the one where he raps incredibly fast?
Yeah, I think he set some record for fastest rapping.
I'll have to check it out, what CD is that on?
It's on his LP2 album he released a few years ago.
Are there other good songs on the album, or should I get the single.
You can't go wrong with the entire album.
Should I get the delux version or regular?
Definitely go with the delux.
Does he still rap about his ex-wife Kim?
I think he says a few things, but it's really back to his roots.
Back at 8 mile?
Oh you know it.
Imagine a rap world without him.
He's revolutionized rap music and brought in millions of fans.
