Hey have you ever hear of Hoodie Gurus?
No who are they?
Early 80's Australian rock band.
How would I have heard of them?
I don't know. They got a good bit of play where I'm from. Leilani, My Girl, Bittersweet.
Wait, that kind of sounds familiar.
You know them...they kind of peaked mid late 80's. I couldn't get enough.
Didn't they stop playing for a while then get back together.
Yeah, I'm not sure if I've heard any of the new stuff. I like the old stuff.
I'm going to have to check it out and see. It sounds so familiar. Nice throw back.
