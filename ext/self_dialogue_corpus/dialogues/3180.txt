I can't wait for football season to start.
Me either. I still can't get over that Superbowl game.
I know, how the Falcons blew that lead is beyond me. Who are you rooting for?
Well not the patriots I know that. I think Seattle is going to play big this season. What about you?
I am hoping the Panthers will come big this year. Cam Newton is definitely talented.
Absolutely. What do you think about Victor Cruz signing with the Bears?
Oh man, I don't know, he'll always be a Giant to me.
Well Odell definiteyl took his place on the team as the lead receiver.
Yes, but he can't do anything if Eli doesn't tighten up.
Do you think this is Eli's last season?
I don't know but I hope he can retire like his brother Peyton with one more Superbowl win.
A Superbowl win over Brady would be epic!
Yes. Did you get any tickets yet?
Not yet, they haven't released the pre-season schedule.
Okay. Who's you favorite rookie this year?
I haven't really been paying attention to the rookie class this year. Any stand outs to you?
Well, Bleacher Report says The 49er's Joe Williams is someone to keep an eye on.
What does he play?
Running back. The Redskins also have a great new rookie running back.
That's cool, well it looks like it will be an exciting season.
