We have been losing so many legendary musicians lately.
I know.  David Bowie, Prince, Chris Cornell.
We lost Scott Weiland from Stone Temple Pilots too.
We did.  They were a good band, but I don't know if I consider them legendary.
I wouldn't disagree.  He wasn't on the level of Prince.
Prince may have been one of the most popular and accomplished musicians that we have had in recent history.
Do you really think so?
I do.  Many people don't know about all his talents.
Prince is great, but he was just a singer right?  His band were the real musicians.
No.  Prince was like a one-man band.
What do you mean?
He played multiple instruments.  On his first album, he played every single instrument that appeared on the album.
I didn't know that.
He would often go into a music studio and create entire songs without the need for anyone else.
How come we don't hear more about Prince's musical abilities?
We do.  However, I think people were more caught up by Prince's image and didn't focus on his abilities.
Prince did have a lot of crazy rumors swirling around about him.
That is the type of figure Prince was.  He was an artist.
I think I am going to have to listen to his entire discography.
Good luck.  Prince has a lot of albums.
