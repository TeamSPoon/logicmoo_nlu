I finally found a thriller movie I liked.
Oh, what was it?
Well, you know I don't usually like thrillers but I liked this one and it was made by Disney.
Disney, really?
Yeah, who'd have thought that Disney would make a good Thriller movie.
Okay, so what is the movie?
The Finest Hours
Ah, I saw the trailer for that.
It stars Chris Pine and Casey Afleck
Isn't Casey Ben's brother.
Yeah, that Afleck.
What's the movie about.
It's based on a story about a storm that causes sailors to be stuck in a sinking tanker.
I'm liking it already.
It's based on a true story.
I like disaster films.
Well, it also has a backstory of a romance.
Of course!
It really made me feel tense and the buildup was intense.
I'm putting it on my to see list.
