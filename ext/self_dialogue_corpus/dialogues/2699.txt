hey, football season's about to start
yeah, i'm really looking forward to this season
my kansas city chiefs are going to beat your raiders for sure
are you kidding me?! our quarterback, derek carr isn't going to let that happen
i still can't believe his the brother of david carr.
yeah, me too, david was never as good as derek
wasn't david chosen number 1 in the draft a long time ago?
yeah, it was back in 2002.
who selected him again?
the houston texans, the where a new team in the nfl, they messed up big time
i know, he had a lot of potential too. i was routing for david
well, i'm just happy that his brother is a much better quarterback, that sounds harsh but its true
either way, you cant beat my chiefs and then they will win the super bowl!
in your dreams, the chiefs always lose in the playoffs. they cant ever get passed the first week of the playoffs.
yeah its sad i know, but this time's is going to be different just you watch
you always say that and they always lose at the end
i can say the same for your raiders
no way, we are the oakland raiders!
aren't they moving to las vegas?
don't remind me.
