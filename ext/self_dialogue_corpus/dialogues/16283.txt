What do you think of classical music?
I really like most of it.
Great, i am always looking for another classical music fan.
Who is your favorite composer?
Vivaldi. He was such a big barque era influence.
Yes he was. He was italian born. But you can see how he had influence all over europe.
Definitely, I think he composed something like 40 operas.
He had so many other works as well. Mainly concertos.
Well who can forget the four seasons?
I feel like people who don't know classical music well even know this one.
True. What is your favorite movement / season in it?
I love spring. You?
I always loved Autumn. That allegro in F major has me hooked.
Each season has something to admire in it.
Vivaldi was able to create such distinct feelings for each.
I agree but feel it also worked all so well together as a whole.
It is cool you can look at it as a whole or in pieces.
Part of the genius of the creation of it.
I have always loved the violin, so this piece is up there.
It is my favorite vivaldi work by far.
