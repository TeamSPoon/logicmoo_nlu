Jason versus Freddy was awful in my opinion.
Why?
I just think they are 2 different horror characters.
Yeah I see what you mean but it was a combination of both.
I think you could have gone with Jason versus anyone else.
Well Freddy exists everywhere.
But just in dreams.
So you think Jason cant arrive in dreams
I think then you go to almost science fiction
No it was a horror movie and it worked right into what the movie should have been
