Did you see the new jewelry I made?
Yes. It's great.
I am selling it now.
Are you making money at it?
Not much but it's a hobby I really enjoy?
Where do you get all those pretty charms and stuff?
Fire Mountain is one place.
I'll have to check that out.
They have a website.
Do you enjoy making jewelry?
I really do.
That's great.
I especially like doing necklaces with chai links.
Those are great. I love this one you made today.
Thanks. Those take a lot of time but are fun to do.
Could you teach me to do it?
Sure. Let's start now.
What do you need?
The rings and clasps.
Thanks. I will get some.
