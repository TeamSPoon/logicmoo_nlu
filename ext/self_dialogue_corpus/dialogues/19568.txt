Afternoon.
Hi.
How are you doing?
Doing quite well.
Good, same here.
Cool.
Who is your favorite band these days?
That is a good question.
Take your time.
Okay.
Any thoughts?
Oh sorry.  I would say The Record Company.
That's the name of the band?
Yeah, The Record Company.
I haven't heard of those guys before.
Yeah they are great.
Tell me more about them.
They have a rock, bluesy sound with some indie in there.
Oh cool.
Yeah you should look them up.
