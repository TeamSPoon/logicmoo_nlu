What was the best gun battle you've seen in a movie?
Has to be Heat when they were on the streets of LA.
Oh yeah, that was just fantastic.
I remember the sound the most.  The bullets just echo off the street and buildings.
That was a great movie throughout.  I liked the ending too.
You mean at the airport?
Right, the cat and mouse games and how he sees his shadow at the end.
Yeah, very tense.
I wish Pacino and Deniro would make another movie.
Hopefully someday, but not banking on it.
