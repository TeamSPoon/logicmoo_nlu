My mom is a huge Elvis Presley fan. Do you like Elvis?
He's great, Old school of course.
He was around during the birth of Rock and Roll. Its king.
So which songs do you like?
Heartbreak Hotel is heartbreaking.
I agree with that.
And then Hound Dog and Blue Suede Shoes are fun.
He was a great dancer too.
Mmm hmm.  Kind of new for the era.
His charisma came through in his music, and everything he did.
