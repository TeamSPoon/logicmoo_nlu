I'm wanting to make a new CD to listen to in my car, want to help?
Sure that shouldn't take us too long.
Hopefully not and it will give us something to listen to on our drive.
So what kind of songs are you thinking about?
Not sure, I was hoping you would have some suggestions.
How about we make a country and pop CD?
That sounds like a really good idea.
What are some singers that you like?
I like Taylor Swift and Carrie Underwood a lot.
Me to! They are two of my favorites.
How about we add Mean and Shake It Off?
That sounds good. What about from Carrie Underwood?
My two favorites are Jesus Take the Wheel and Temporary Home.
Those sound good. I like both of those as well.
Can you think of any more artists?
How about Miranda Lambert?
Yes she is really talented.
We shouod get More Like Her and The House that Built Me.
Ok, we will definitey add those to the playlist
This will be a great CD, I can't wait to listen to it.
