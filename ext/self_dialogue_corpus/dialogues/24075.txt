Do you like the movie Talladega Nights?
Yes I have.
It is one of the funniest movies.
I agree, it has some great one liners.
Who is your favorite character?
I like Ricky Bobby.
Ricky is very funny.
Who is your favorite character?
I like both of the kids.
Yes, the kids are hilarious.
My favorite part is when they are sitting around the dinner table.
That is so funny, I died laughing.
Me too.
I love the way they talk to the grandfather.
That is the best.
I hope they make a sequel.
That would be pretty neat.
I wonder if they ever will.
Even if they did it probably would not be as good as the first one.
You are probably right.
