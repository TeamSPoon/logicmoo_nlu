Do you think wookies have flea and lice problems?
I would definitely say so. I mean with all that fur who knows what could set up shop in there.
Do you think they use soap and shampoo to bathe, or just shampoo?
Well they are like 90% fur so I would think that soap would be somewhat useless.
What about a wookie with severe alopecia?
You mean a bald wookie or mostly bald wookie?
Exactly, they would need soap don't you think?
I'd say so but I bet their skin is sensitive so it would be like aloe vera based, very gentle and soothing soap.
Do wookies ever suffer from male pattern baldness?
Beats me. Have you ever seen a bald wookie? I haven't.
