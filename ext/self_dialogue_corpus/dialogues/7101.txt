What's you favourite Disney film?
Probably Robin Hood, I like the animals.
Really? It's alright I guess.
What! Only alright. The opening theme song is one of the greatest of all time and Maid Marion is an absolute babe.
Wasn't she a fox.
Yeah she was one foxy lady.
That's pretty weird mate.
What, so Robin Hood can fancy her but I can't?
Yeah, because he was also an animated fox and you're, apparently, a legitimate human being.
If you say so, but it feels like double standards.
