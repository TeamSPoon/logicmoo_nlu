One thing that made fans angry about the prequels was the clone armor.
What was the problem with it?
In all the other movies, they have physical costumes.
Alright, go on.
But in the prequels, it's all entirely CGI.  No armor was built as it wasn't needed.
I've never noticed before to be honest with you.
It's completely true.  They didn't see the need since they weren't being staffed by actors
The first prequels relied a bit too heavy on special effects.
I would agree.  They were never quite to my liking.
Thankfully, it improved later on as fan criticism took its toll on the filmmakers.
