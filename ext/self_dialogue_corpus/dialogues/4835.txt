Where would you put the Phillies in terms of how many years away they are?
They havent shown much progress this year so 3 years.
Thats a while to make a fanbase wait
Theyve been patient before
The problem is they have no pitching.
I havent seen much from their hitting either
Thats another spot I thought we would see something
Do you think they have issues with their bullpen?
Yes but that can be easily fixed
How?
Slide some of those starters into the pen
That would hamper the starting pitching though
And those guys have not been good
I think Aaron Nola is a reliver in the making
Yeah he cant stay healthy
So make him throw one inning a game if that
Thats not a bad idea
And then you put Velasquez as the closer
Hes got the heat to do that
Exactly it makes so much sense.
