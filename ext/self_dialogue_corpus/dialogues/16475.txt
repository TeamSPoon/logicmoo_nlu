Have you ever listened to Queensryche?
Yes, but not in a long time.
Do you know if they have any new albums coming out?
No, not really.  I have been listening to newer music lately.
I loved their album called Operation MIndcrime!
Wow, that is an older one, isn't it?
It is.  Do you know what was different about it, to me?
No, tell me about it.
It is a concept album.
What does that mean?
It means, in this case, that the album tells a story.
Really?  That is cool1
It really is.  The first song starts off telling a story.
And so it continues the story throughout the album?
It does!  And they are all cool and different songs.
Neat!  What is your favorite song?
I think it is a tie between the title track and "The Eyes of a Stranger".
Those both sound like something I need to listen to!
You really should give it a listen!
I will!  Thanks for the recommendation!
