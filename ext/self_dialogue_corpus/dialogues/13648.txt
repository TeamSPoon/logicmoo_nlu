Do you like Star Wars?
I love it!
Do you think it's realistic?
It would be realistic if it was easier to travel faster in space
Yeah, I could see something like that happening
I think it would not be likely for there to be so many aliens
There is no force.
Some buildings are a bit tall
It inspires me to work hard
It inspires me too
