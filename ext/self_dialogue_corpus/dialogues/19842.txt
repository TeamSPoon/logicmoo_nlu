I started listening to a Celtic Punk band recently.
Really, who's that?
The Dropkick Murphys.
I never heard of them.
Well I'm sure you heard at least part of one of their songs.
Don't think so.
Yes, they play it in a beer commercial.
Really, which one?
Samuel Adams. Great song.
Do they play anything popular?
Not that you would hear on the regular radio.
Do they sing The Warriors Code? It was in a movie.
Yes.
That's them . Okay I heard that song, it's good.
They played I'm Shipping Up to Boston at a Bruins- Flyers game.
I know that song. Didn't know it was them.
Now you do.
Well, I'll have to look them up.
You should. Great upbeat music.
I'll check them out on Spotify.
