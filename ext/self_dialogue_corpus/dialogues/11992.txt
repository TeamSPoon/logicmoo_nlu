Someone told me you love Star Wars Episodes I, II and III... WHY?
Because despite the poor performance in II and III, the set the tone for the later years...
Give me two reasons why they're better than the original films. I bet you can't!
I didn't say they were better. Just that they were great. I'll give you two factors that are improvements over the originals though. Number one: the CGI effect allowed for more creatures, more beautiful landscapes, more action than ever before.
Okay, I'll give you that one. The Naboo landscapes were gorgeous, and the underwater Gungan City were phenomenal. Reason number two?
It showed the origins of Anakin Skywalker, and the real reason why he turned to the dark side in the other films.
The real reason? Do you mean that he turned to the dark side when Padme was killed?
No, no, that's not what I mean. I mean, Anakin was never supposed to be a Jedi. He was never supposed to be good. It was only the love he received from his mother, from Qui-Gon, Padme and Obi-Wan that made him conflicted and want to be good. It was these warring factions inside himself that caused the emotional battles that ultimately brought balance to the force by his coming full circle.
I don't know what to say. I'm speechless. Great points. May the force be with you.
And also with you.
