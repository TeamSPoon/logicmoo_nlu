Wasn't Cloud City the coolest?
Yeah, Lando really found a cool job as a city manager there.
Yeah, and he had that one bald assistant that had those head phones.
Oh yeah I remember him. Whatever happened to him?
I don't think they showed anything in movie.
I imagine he was shot be a stormtrooper at some point.
Nah, those stormtroopers could never hit anyone with their blasters.
Ha! That's true.
Maybe it was Bobba Fett.
Yeah, he seemed to have better aim and intelligence.
