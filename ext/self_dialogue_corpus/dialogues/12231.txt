What did you think of the state-of-the-art CGI in the new Star Wars movies?
Oh, I love it. Its so gorgeous.
Which scenes are you thinking of?
It was interesting to me how they completely computer-generated Princess Leia.
Right. Some people found that eery though.
Yeah the timing wasn't great. Then Snoke was intriguing.
I agree there. You didn't think he was too much like a Lord of the Rings character?
Is that what they're saying.
Some people think that.
Thats not what I think at all.
