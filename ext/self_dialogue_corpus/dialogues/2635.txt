Do you know if a lot of today's NFL teams are the same teams that were in the beginning when the NFL first started?
Only two of them are.
Which ones?
One is the Decatur Staleys which became the Chicago Bears.
Who is the other one?
That would be the Chicago Cardinals which became the Arizona Cardinals.
Two teams seems like such a small amount.
You have to consider that there were only ten teams at the time.
So ten states had football teams?
No. The ten teams were only in four states.
When was the NFL founded?
Back in 1920, but it didn't use the NFL name until 1922.
I thought the Green Bay packers were one of the original teams.
Close. They actually joined in 1921.
What about the AFL. Were they founded back then, too?
No. They actually weren't founded until 1960.
That's really long time after the NFL.
It is, but because of it, the Super Bowl was created so the rivals could play off against each other.
I catch the Super Bowl every year.
It's my favorite game of the year.
