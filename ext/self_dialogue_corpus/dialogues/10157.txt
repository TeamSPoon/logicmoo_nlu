The all-time best action movie ever made is actually a remake. It's The Magnificent Seven.
Oh yeah, I love that flick. Seven heroes ride into town, and save all the little people.
That's true, but first you get to know them one by one. Yul Brenner is introduced as the cagey old gunslinger Chris Adams.
Un-huh. Then Steve McQueen plays Vin Tanner, who loses his shirt gambling, and signs up.
Then there's Charles Bronson, playing Bernardo O'Reilly, who's down and out.
No, you left out Brad Dexter, who plays the conniving Harry Luck.
Okay, then we see James Coburn demonstrate his knife and gun skills as Britt.
Great stuff. Next we meet gentleman Robert Vaughn, plays Lee, who's afraid he's a coward.
And the last to join up is the tag-a-long kid Chico, played by Horst Buchholtz, who wants morethan anything to be a gunslinger.
Then they all ride into town, and save the day.
