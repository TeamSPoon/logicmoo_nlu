I just learned a whole bunch about star wars movies!
Oh yeah! What?
Did you know they almost used a monkey to play Yoda?
No, I had never heard of that.
Also, the word "Ewok" is never mentioned in the movies.
Are you sure?
Yeah, the name only appears in the script.
Anything else?
The language the Ewoks speak is a combination of Tibetan and Nepalese.
Wow! I thought their language was just gibberish.
