I think some people are overrated
What do you mean
Like they are said to be better than they really are
Is that a bad thing?
Well yeah it makes them over inflate their ego
Who in question are we referring to as overrated though
A certain director
Name names i cannot comment without that
Well sorry about that
It is good man
Peter jackson his directing is awful
I guess i am going to have to disagree with you
Why would you do that
Because his directing is actually pretty good i must say
No way it is way to over dramatic
But that is the point
It falls flat because of that
I think it is atmospheric
Sometimes other times it is shameful
Eh
