Black Sabbath played their final show in Febuary, and they are having a special one night movie screening of it.
When's the movie screening?
September 28th for one night only, in over 1500 movie theatres across the country.
Where was their last concert at?
Birmingham, at a 16,000 seat concert venue..
Was it sold out?
Yep. The band considers Birmingham their home.
Is the movie just a recording of the concert?
No. It also has behind the scenes stories and conversations, as well as live performance, and versions done in studio that were not done on tour.
Wow, so it's going to be a pretty special movie for the fans.
And only for one night at the theatre. Ozzy said this was definitely the end, they won't be getting back together later.
Well, they have to be getting really old.
The band released a statement saying they never dreamed when they started that they would be playing a final show in their home town 49 years later.
Were all the original members at the last show?
No, their drummer Bill Ward has been estranged from the band for quite awhile.
He couldn't even come back for the last show?
He claimed he reached out to the management about it, and they said they were not interested.
Ouch.
I'm going to mark it on my calendar, and see about going to the movie. I imagine there will be a lot of sold out theatres.
Maybe they will do pre-sales, and you could find out how soon those would be available.
