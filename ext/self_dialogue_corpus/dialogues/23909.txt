I'm going to see Guardians of the Galaxy volume 2, would you like to come?
I would absolutely love to!
Are you a fan of Chris Pratt?
Yeah, he isn't the reason I want to see it.
Why are you wanting to see this movie?
I really love rocket raccoon. I think he is really funny.
I can see your point. He is my second favorite.
What is that tree guys name?
His name is Groot.
I should've known that that is the only thing that he says.
I heard that they are supposed to reveal his father this movie.
I heard that as well. Is it true that he is the whole planet?
In the comics he is, but I'm not sure how they're going to do it in a movie.
Is this movie rated R?
No this movie is rated PG-13.
That is great, would you mind if I took my little brother?
I don't mind at all. Everybody is welcome to come.
I heard that Groot is played by Vin diesel. Is that true?
Yes, it actually is true. He does voice acting.
That makes me want to see this movie even more.
