I wonder if Brave is getting a sequel?
I don't know it has been a while.
Yea, 5 years, can you believe it?
Not at all, man.
Yea, but I do hope it gets a sequel.
What's left to say?
I would love to see Merida as Queen!
That would be awesome.
All the elegance of her mother, Elinor but the toughness of her father, Fergus.
Agreed, but you know, Elinor was pretty tough herself, taking on Mordu...
