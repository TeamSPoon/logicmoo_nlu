What do you think is Martin Scorsese's best movie?
Wow, that's a tough one.  Where do you start?
You almost have to break it down by the decade.
That would be one way of going about it.
Let's make it easy and just say movies he's done in the last 20 years.
I like that approach better.
For me, I'd probably go with The Departed.
That's a pretty solid choice.  I'd go with Wolf of Wall Street.
Yeah, but The Departed won best picture.
The best movie of the year sometimes doesn't though.
I get that, but it was a well put together crime drama with some touches of humor and great characters and dialogue.
And Wolf of Wall Street wasn't?
I'm not saying it was a horrible movie, just not as good as The Departed.
Wolf of Wall Street had an even better performance by Leo.
He was good in that movie, not taking that away from him.
The characters were also better and more memorable too.  Remember Matthew McConaughey's character?
Yeah, the coked out stock broker at the beginning.
That was a great, effective setup and an awesome performance in only five minutes.
But that one scene doesn't make a great movie.
You're missing the point here.  It's an example of why I like the movie more on a whole.
