Did you hear about Marshawn Lynch coming back to the NFL?
Yes.  I think it should be an exciting season.
What do you think about him playing for the Raiders?
That is his hometown team, correct?
Yes, Marshawn grew up in that area.
I think it's great.  Playing at home is probably really exciting for him.
Yes.  I know the Raider fans are glad to have him.
I think he retired too soon anyway.
It was kind of surprising when he retired from the Seahawks.
Was he unhappy there or something?
I really don't know.  They won the superbowl and then lost it on one play the following season.
Yes.  The play was so horrible.
They should have ran the ball with Lynch.
Maybe he took that pretty hard and retired because of it.
It probably was not that one thing but maybe that was the straw that broke the camels back.
Well I am just glad to see him play again.  He is a pretty exciting running back.
I really wonder if he lost a step in retirement.
I wonder that too.  I wonder if I knew he was coming back and keep in shape from the beginning.
The season starts in about two months so we will see.
Yes.  I really can't wait for the start of this NFL season.
