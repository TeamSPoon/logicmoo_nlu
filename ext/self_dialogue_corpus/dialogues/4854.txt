I am not sure but have you seen the current trades going  on in the MLB they are insane.
Yeah i doubt some of those trades are good.
Why do you have doubts regarding those trades?
The trades just seem one way and they are getting some shitty pitchers.
I think i disagree the pitcher the braves got is going to be a legend one of these days?
Who is the pitcher you are talking about?
One of the pitchers is Jim Johnson.
I do not think i have heard of him might be why i view them all as bad.
He is really good he is like a flying bullet and he will help the Braves win.
I am not really a fan of the braves i have never really watched them.
You should give them a chance and watch them they are a good team.
I might if i get time but they probally play during a game i want to watch.
Well you can record games with your DVR and you can watch it later.
That sounds pretty easy do you know when their next game is?
Their next game is on Monday night not to far off.
That is a day i would be busy then  so i will have to record their game.
I promise you will not regret it the whole team is amazing. Their batters can hit anything.
We will see i am not so sure about that. But I want to look into the current trades though as i want to follow them you plan to follow?
Definitely i want to get all the info on the newcomers and who is going around.
Yeah that is true it is best to keep up to date with all that.
