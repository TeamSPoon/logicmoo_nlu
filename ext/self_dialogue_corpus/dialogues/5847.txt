Did you hear that Tarzan is the brother to the princesses in Frozen?
No way!
Yes way, they even got people from Disney to speak on it.
I can't believe that. Isn't he in the jungle though?
That's what I thought. But maybe they just sailed really far away.
I guess so. They don't have the same coloring though.
Well, I guess Tarzan just got really tan.
I wonder if they'll ever make a movie where Tarzan and the princesses meet.
Hmmm, that'd be interesting to accomplish.
I'd definitely go watch it though.
