Hey do you like the star universe
I sort of do why
I need someone to talk about it with
Sure we can talk about it a little
Good so who is your favorite Hunter
Well it is hard to choose for me
I like jango he is pretty awesome
Jango was unique
The best in the franchise
might not go that far to be honest
