So, I went to see a local band last night.
Were they any good.
No. They were just called 'Todd' but none of the members was named Todd.
That's really disappointing.
I know, I was hoping for better. The music felt like a bad version of Travis, or Snow Patrol.
Do you think they named themselves Todd to sound like Travis?
Haha, maybe. They weren't as good though.
What's Travis up to lately? I haven't listened to them in ages.
They came out with a new album last year. It's called Everything at Once.
Is it any good.
I'm not sure. I haven't listened yet. I'll let you know.
What do I remember them from? It's been ages since I first looked them up.
They had a song play in one episode of The Office.
Oh, that's it! That's what it was.
I got introduced to them through that show too.
It's funny how TV can sometimes introduce you to new bands.
I don't think they'll ever introduce me to a band like Todd though.
You should take me with you next time!
It'd definitely be more fun than going alone.
Then it's a date!
