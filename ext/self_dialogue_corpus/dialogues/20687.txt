What do you think about the new Emoji movie?
It looks pretty inane to me. About the entire intention of that movie is to sell stuff.
About the entire intention of that movie is to sell stuff.yeah, it does seem a little kitschy for my taste. Are there any summer movies out that you're looking forward to?
I haven't paid attention to what's coming out; do you have any suggestions?
So many of the summer's movies are just old movies rehashed or sequels. I don't think anything original is out there.
Maybe the remake of Planet of the Apes. All the others are paid for by Hasbro.
Planet of the apes looks interesting, I'll give you that. But I think the idea is just too old. I think something with robots would be more interesting than eight.
I agree. With the political scene the way it is mad Max beyond thunder dome have some hope.
What was your favorite ever summer of movies?
Just can't beat the summer Jaws came out. I was about 10 years old and lovedto be afraid in the theater but not in the ocean.  That movie had all of us terrified.
My favorite had to be the summer of 1978 when Greese came out. I think I saw it about 10 times in the theater. I just couldn't get enough
Well that was a good one.
And both of those films were so original. I just can't get into all these fifth and sixth editions. Mission Impossible, Teansformers, Spider-Man.
I know what you mean. The first ones were terrific. You just can't achieve the same level of excitement.
The best time for film is October to February.
A great preview for the oscars,
The targeted age group must be sixteen in the summer.
Sounds about right.
I just realized we were sixteen when our favorite summer of movies won us over. I guess there's something to it.
Ha ha. Oh yeah! Summer movies must be for the young at heart!
