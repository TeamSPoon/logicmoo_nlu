I don't think they'll use Mace Windu in Rebels.  It just seems like a waste.  They'll have to save him for the movies.
Samuel L. Jackson might be too busy being Nick Fury.
I don't think that would stop Disney.  They can just delay a MCU movie.
It would be reckless, though.  They like money more than they like cool things.
That's a good point.  But they should at least give him a comic.
The comics have even fewer readers than Rebels has viewers.
That's why they can do it.  It won't have as big an impact, but it won't be disruptive, either.
Yeah, people can always dismiss the comics.
And a Mace Windu comic would be good for testing the waters if they want to use him in Rebels.
I still think it's a bad idea, though. He had a cool death.
