Are you doing to see the new Deadpool film?
I haven't decided yet.
Did you see the last one ?
I seen it twice.
Did you like it ?
I thought it was very funny!
Deadpool had a lot of jokes.
I liked the kind of humor. The ones that are aware of themselves.
Breaking the fourth wall it is called I think.
Like when he refers to himself. Deadpool , refers to Ryan Reynolds.
That was so funny. I liked when he referenced the two shows he was in before as different superheroes.
Oh, the last one he played Deadpool in. But a different version.
Yes! In the Xmen movies.
That was not a great rendition.
I think that's why the made the film. To make a real Deadpool.
He also refers to Green Lantern.
Yep. He played in that film too. Totally bombed.
Did you ever see it ?
I actually did ! Did you?
No. I never got the chance to.
