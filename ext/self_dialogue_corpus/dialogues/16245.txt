What kind of music do you like?
I like rap.
Is that different from hip hop?
Hip hop is smoother.
I like rock music.
Like hair bands?
I like 60s, 70s, and 80s rock.
Those were good decades for music.
My dad likes jazz.
I can't imagine why.
Do you like classical music?
I don't think anyone does.
Have you ever played a musical instrument?
I play guitar a little.
I played the violin in school but I was terrible.
It takes practice.
Sometimes I listen to country when I'm sad.
Or when you have been drinking.
House music is more upbeat.
It is good for clubbing.
