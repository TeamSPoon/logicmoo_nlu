Did you see the Cardinals game?
Yeah Matheny is a great coach?
I can't believe he took out Molina for a switch hitter
I was surprised too till he hit that homerun
Yes walk off homeruns are the best
Bet Pujols is wishing he stayed in St Louis now
Is your son still playing baseball
Yes he plays shortstop
Aww shortstop, has he tried second base?
Yes, but he prefers short stop
What about pitching
He's not a very good pitcher.
I thought he had a good fastball
Yes he does but his curve ball is weak
Did you try pitching lesdons
Yes but his heart wasn't in it
Oh, I loved playing catcher
I was more of a left fielder.  I could throw out a runner at home plate with my srm
Hey you want to see the cards vs cubs game this weekend
Watch the cards beat the cubs? Of course I do
