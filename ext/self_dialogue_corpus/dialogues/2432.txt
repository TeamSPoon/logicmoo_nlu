Do you have any NFL predictions for the upcoming season?
I don't think you ever count out New England.
Well I agree with that.
I think you have to watch out for the raiders.
I agree,they could be tough.
In the NFC I think Green Bay has a good shot.
They are usually going to be in the mix.
I'm not sold on the Cowboys being that good this year.
It will be interesting to see what Prescott and Elliot do in year two.
The league has a way of adjusting to rookies.
Yes it does.
I'm hearing talk of Tampa bay rising to the top.
I've read some things.
Watch out for Seattle too.
They always seem to be solid defensively.
Defense keeps you in games.
The Giants should be right there especially with their defense.
The defense should actually be better.
I agree with that.
They only lost one starter on defense from last year.
