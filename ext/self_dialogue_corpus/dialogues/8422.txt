Who is the better pop artist Rhianna or Taylor Swift
That is very hard to choose because both have different sounds.
Very True, Rihanna has a Regae pop sound and Taylor Swift is the girl next door.
I agree they sounds totally different. What is your favorite Rihanna song.
I love "Pon De Replay". I know it is very old but it is my all time favorite
I would have to say "We Found Love" is the best, but I also love "Pon De Replay"
That is a great choice also. What is your all time favorite Taylor Swift song,
"Shake It Off" is one of the best song in my opinion. What about you?
"Blank Space" is one of my favortive song.
Great choice I love that one also
