Who is your favorite 80's rock band?
I have many that I love, but my favorite is probably Queen.
Weren't they popular in the 70's too?
Yes, and they are still touring now.
I thought that the lead singer passed away, didn't he?
Yes, Freddie Mercury died in 1991. So many people miss him so much!
I remember what a great voice he had. I love that song called We Will Rock You!
I loved his voice too and he was so talented. Adam Lambert has been touring with Queen recently as the lead singer.
I like Adam Lambert's voice as well, but nothing can compare to Freddie Mercury's voice.
I agree. He was one of the best rock singers of all times in my opinion.
