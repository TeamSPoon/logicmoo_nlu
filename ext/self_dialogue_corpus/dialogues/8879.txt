Did you see Metalica at the Grammys?
Yeah, hillarious!
Hetfield was so mad!
He threw his guitar off stage after the performance.
I totally missed that!
Gaga seemed pretty happy though.
I'll be she was.
The mic all to herself.
I thought it was going to be terribl.
It was! That's why it was so great!
