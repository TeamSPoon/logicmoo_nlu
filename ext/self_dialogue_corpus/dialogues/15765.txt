What's your favorite genre of music?
I like world music.
Me too! I love raggae!
Did you know that it started in the 1960s?
No, but I do know some of the early music styles that influenced it.
What are those styles of music?
It was a combination of rhythm and blues, mento, and jazz.
What is mento music?
It's a traditional form of music from Jamaica. It's a form of folk music made using mostly acoustic instruments.
I understand. Is it similar to calypso?
Yes, but calypso is from Trinidad and Tobago.
Wow, do you know any other types of island music?
Sure, there's also kaiso music. It's from small islands like St. Lucia and Dominica.
Where did it originally come from?
It's from Kongo which is now Nigeria.
How did it get to those islands?
It appears to have been brought by the slaves who were taken to those islands.
It is also mostly instrumental music?
No, there's usually a lead singer in kaiso music. And, they sing in creole.
That makes sense as creole would nicely reflect the combination of African and European influence.
