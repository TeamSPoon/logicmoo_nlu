Who is your favorite NFL team?
I'm a big Eagles fan, myself!
Ah, are you from Philadelphia?
Yup! What team is your favorite?
I'm a Colts fan.
That's Indianapolis, right?
Yes! I'm from Indiana.
How do you feel about the Patriots?
I'm not a fan of that team. I assume you aren't either?
Nope. I don't like them or the Giants.
I like the Giants a bit because Eli Manning is on that team.
Why does that matter?
I'm a fan of his brother Peyton.
He is not on the Colts, though, is he?
No, but he used to be.
So you like the Mannings?
Yes, I like anyone from that family!
That's interesting!
What other team do you like?
I also like the Seahawks.
