Do you like 90's Pop music at all?
Ehh kinda, depends on who you're talking about.
Teh Backstreet Boys?
Okay, yes. I don't care who you are, where you're from or what you've done, you like them.
Hahaha! I totally agree, they get a bad reputation from people but they were good.
People talk down about them because they are afraid to admit they like them!
I agree, what about Britney Spears?
Oops, I did it again.
What did you do?
Nothing. I love me some Britney haha.
Me too! She was so much better than Christina Aguillera.
No way! Christina was amazing!
I agree, but not as good as Britney.
You are so wrong, you probably think N'Sync was better than backstreet Boys too.
As a matter of fact I do.
You're crazy! They weren't half as good.
They had better artists.
All they had was Justin Timberlake!
Yea, but who else was even half as successful as him from Bacstreet?
Touche my friend, touche.
