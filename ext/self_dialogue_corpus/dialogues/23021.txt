Did you see the remake of Miracle?
Yes I did.  That was an awesome movie.
Yeah, they put so much work into it.
I was watching how they did the sound.  For the American Skates they used smaller skates than the Russian ones.
Why is that?
To make the impression the Russians were bigger.  So the skakes sounded like a larger body.
Cool.  Kurt Russle was amazing as Herb Brooks.
It's too bad he died during the making of the movie.
Yeah unexpectedly too.
But the memorial is he didn't need to see it, he lived it.
That's awesome.
Yes it was.  It's incredible how they remade every part of the movie.
Remaking the plays and everything.
I know.  Al Michaels re-doing his whole commentary.
All except they said you can't remake the emotion of the final call.
Yes, you can hear it switch to live.
Awesome part though.  I mean it gives me goosbumps.
That whole movie does.
It's one of those ones to show to you kids.
Yeah I agree, they'll be better for it.
