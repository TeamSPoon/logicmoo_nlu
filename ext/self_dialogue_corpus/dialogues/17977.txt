What's the most important part of any rock band?
The most important part, you mean instrument-wise?
Yeah. Which instrument/part matters the most to you when you're listening.
I'd have to say the singer. The first thing I hear when I listen to a song is the vocals.
That's the most important?
Sure, I mean you identify bands a lot of the time by listening to their vocals. Would Guns n' Roses be the same without Axle's voice?
No, I'd probably like them better without it but I see your point. Still, isn't rock music really about the beat?
Most music is about the beat, or has one anyway.
So wouldn't that make the drumming the most important part? That steady 4-beat is what drives a song.
But all of the parts are going in rhythm, not just the drums.
True, but if one thing is the road and the other things just drive down the road which one is picking the direction?
Ok so maybe the drums are the beat-makers but do you ever listen to a song and ignore the rest just to hear the drums?
Yes. Keith Moon, the Who's drummer was amazing to listen to!
Ok but when I listen to Pinball Wizard I'm hearing the words and the lyrics. The drumming can be as excellent as it wants but it's still in the background.
Just because something isn't the first thing you hear doesn't make it less important though.
It does to me. When I listen to a band if I don't like the singer I don't even want to hear the rest of the band.
Why? The band could be amazing!
Because if the singer's no good and their vocals are right in front of me the whole time I'm going to be too annoyed to like the rest of the band.
So the singer really is it for you then?
The first thing I hear, and the thing I judge bands by. Absolutely.
