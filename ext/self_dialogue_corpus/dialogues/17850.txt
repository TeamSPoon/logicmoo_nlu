I'm trying to find some music to listen to, can you help me?
Sure, what kind do you like? Rock, Country, or what?
I think I'm in the mood for some rock.
Ok, that narrows it down.  Do you want something new or old?
I want something new, but also something that seems familiar?
Do you like Metallica?
Yes, but I'm kinda tired of them.
What about Avenged Sevenfold?  Have you heard of them?
No, I haven't.  Are they any good?
I enjoy listening to them.  They remind me some of Metallica, but with some other influences too.
Interesting, have they been around long?
Yeah, several years, I'm suprised you havent heard of them.
Me too. Do they get played on the radio often?
Yeah, I hear them on the rock station quite a bit.
Hmmm...interesting.  I guess I need to listen to it more.
You sure do!
What album of theirs do you recommend?
I would start with Hail to the King, and then work back some.
Some?
Yeah, their earlier stuff sounds different, not as good!
