You're a rap fan right?
Yeah, you know me haha, I'm always listening to some rapper.
So, you know I'm not a huge fan of rap, but there's one that I really can't understand how people listen to?
Alright, who is it?
It's not just one rapper, it's all of those mumbling guys.
Haha, yeah I know what you mean, what song did you hear?
I think it was something like little yacht or something.
Yeah, lil yachty.  He's pretty catchy, but I can see what you're saying.  There's a bunch of younger rappers out there like that.
Do you like it?
Well, I like lil yachty, but I can't stand lil uzi vert.
I have no idea what that is.
He's a rapper and one of those mumbling guys, you probably haven't heard any of his songs.
Is there anyone new that's actually good?
Well, I like Dram, he's not a mumbler, but he actually sings on a lot of his songs, and they're really catchy.
Who does he sound like?
You know that "girl, you've got what I need" song?
Yeah! I love that song.
He sounds like him.
Alright, I'll give it a shot, what song should I listen to?
Check out Broccoli and Cash Machine.
