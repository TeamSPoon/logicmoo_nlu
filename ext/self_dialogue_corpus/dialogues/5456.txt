Finding Nemo was funny and sad, I liked dory
it really was a good movie with a great happy ending
finding nemo was a cute movie
when he got lost, that part was sad
I know, and when they ended up in the fish tank
the sea turtles were the best part
they were, they are really amazing creatures
They are and I think that they really stole the show
did you know that the type of fish Nemo is, the dad usually eats the babies
I have heard something like that, that is why he ran away
