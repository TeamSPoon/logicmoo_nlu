Who's your favorite director of thriller movies?
It would have to be Alfred Hitchcock.
I totally agree! What's your favorite Hitchcock movie?
I think it's probably Strangers On A Train.
Why is that?
Because of the twists and turns. You never really know where it's going.
Oh, I love movies like that! The ones that keep you guessing.
Hitchcock was the master of that, he made so many great suspense movies.
And liked that he always made a cameo in his movies.
And in Strangers on a Train, his daughter has a role. She was a pretty good actress!
