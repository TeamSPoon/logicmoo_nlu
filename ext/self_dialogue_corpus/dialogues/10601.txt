Do you like the Fast and Furious movies?
Yeah I do, but I liked them more when they were more about cars.
Yeah, they stopped that around the fifth one it seems like.
Yeah, once the Rock got involved in the franchise it became more about action than racing.
It is not as good without Paul Walker.
I know right, it is just not the same with Bryan in them.
I think when Paul Walker passed away, they should of just ended the series there.
Yeah, they had a really good send-off for him in the seventh movie.
That song they played at the end almost made me cry.
It was the saddest part of any Fast and Furious movie, I can tell you that.
