What did you think of the live-action Beauty and the Beast movie?
I don't know, I think I like the animated one better.
Really? I thought the live-action one was pretty good.
It just felt like it was copying the animated movie. It had all the same songs.
They're great songs, though!
They are! But if you want to hear "Tale as Old as Time," why not just watch the animated movie?
I thought Emma Watson was great as Belle.
She was pretty good. But I thought the special effects looked kind of weird.
Well, I like them both.
The live-action one wasn't bad. But the animated one is a true classic.
