What are some of your favorite action films?
I really like Tom Cruise action movies actually.
Yeah, he's done quite a few.  I loved Days of Thunder
That's a good one, I like a lot of his more recent films too.
I haven't seen too many of his newer films, I heard the Mission Impossible Films are pretty good.
They are.  I also like the Jack Reacher films.
I've never seen those either.  Do you like Matt Damon?
Yes, I'm a huge fan of the Jason Bourne series.
Me too, did you watch the latest one?
Yes, it was awesome.
