I just got a new Red Hot Chili Peppers CD.
Cool, which one did you get?
It's an old one, Californication.
I used to have that one, it's still a good CD.
I always wanted it, but I couldn't afford it when it came out.
I had to save up for three months when I got mine.
I do not miss being a broke kid.
Yeah I was only getting like 2 bucks a week.
Well if you wanna come over sometime we can rock down memory lane.
That'd be cool, I don't get to hear them on the radio as much anymore.
Californication is my favorite song by them.
I liked Give It Away and Danni California.
Well they do have a bunch of great songs.
I had like 10 of their CDs.
Lucky, I had some bootleg tapes.
Hey I still kept a tape in the deck in case something came on.
I got find where I put all those, I had over 100 tapes with the best of hits.
Imagine how much you would of had to pay for those CDs back then.
Why do you think I would record them.
Well I wouldn't tell that to too many people until you find out what the statute of limitations are for piracy.
