Do you like movies based on true stories?
I do, but only if they follow the story really well.
I agree, it is hard to watch movies that go way off base of true stories.
Do you like remakes of movies?
I do like some. Have you seen The Hills have Eyes?
Yes I have.
Have you seen the original or remake?
I have seen both actually.
Which movie did you like better?
The remake was scary, and very hard to watch some parts.
I think they followed the original very well!
Have you seen AMityville Horror?
Yes I have, is that also a remake?
Yes it is, I think it is also based on a true story as well.
I was not aware of that, I will have to watch the original.
It is older, so I think the remake was better too.
It seems the remakes of old movies seem to be good due to the technology to make better scenes now.
I would agree with you on that.
Do you like the movies on Netflix?
They have such a huge variety!
