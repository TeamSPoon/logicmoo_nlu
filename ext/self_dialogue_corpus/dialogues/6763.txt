Have you seen that new Disney movie Moana?
Yes! My kids and I love that movie!
So much better than Frozen isn't it?
I am glad that they hype for that one has finally died down.
Same here, although my favorite Disney movie will always be The Little Mermaid.
I have always loved Beauty and the Beast.
Well, have you seen the live action Beauty and the Beast?
Yes! I think they did a wonderful job creating it.
I thought so too, and Emma was such a wonderful choice for Bell.
I don't think they could have chose better.
