Did you get a chance to see Guardians of the Galaxy 2 yet?
Yes I thought it was a great movie.
They really did a great job with it.
I didnt know how I was going to feel about the franchise.
I did not know much about it prior to its production.
Yeah me neither but they took it to the big screen with ease
They found the right blend of actors.
To be honest I can barely tell Bradley Cooper is in it.
He does a good job with his voice.
He acted it perfectly.
Chris Pratt is a good actor to be honest.
Yeah I loved him in it.
Did you see the new Jurassic Park as well?
I did and thought he did a good job.
He blends the dry humor with acting every well.
I agree he does a fine job with it.
Could you see him doing more than just those kinds of films?
He could pull off a comedy as well.
I hope he stays with the Guardian franchise.
They never have turnover from that
