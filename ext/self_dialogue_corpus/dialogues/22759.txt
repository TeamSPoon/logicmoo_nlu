Which Harry Potter movie do you like best?
That's a hard one. Probably the third or fourth.
Which ones are those again?
Prisoner of Azkaban or Goblet of Fire.
Oh, right. Goblet of Fire is probably my favorite.
Yeah, it's just such a different setup from the ones before it.
True, the tasks are so cool.
Yeah, and it was nice to have a bunch of new characters in the mix.
Definitely! Fleur and Cedric are my favorite.
True, they're both so good looking.
I know. Cedric's death is so sad though.
Don't bring it up, it's horrible.
Yeah, at least Robert Pattinson got to do Twilight after.
That's true, he's definitely done well since then.
Yeah, and Goblet of Fire is really when things start to go bad, you know?
Right, it's the first time Voldemort is really back I think.
They made him so scary in the films.
True. They really had to work on Ralph Fiennes to get his face like that, I bet.
Definitely, it's so scary.
Voldemort is for sure one of my favorite villains.
