How did you like beauty and the beast?
I have not watched it yet, how did you like it?
I didn't really care for it, but my son loved it.
Really, what did he like about it.
He is very smart and he enjoyed the storyline.
Oh yes, there is a great storyline in that movie.
He was engaged the entire time in the movie.
It is great that he was focused on something positive.
It was a good learning experience for him.
Sounds great, I'll make sure my children watch that movie as well.
