Have you ever seen the U.K. movie Bronson                         User 2:
No I have never heard of it. What's it about?
Its about Britans most violent criminal. he was only sentenced to 5 years, but hes been in prison for more than 30 years.
That's crazy who's in it?
Tom Hardy plays The main Character Bronson.
Tom Hardy that played Baine in Batman?
Same actor I think he even won some awards for this movie, but I'm not sure
So why has he been in prison for so long if only got sentenced for five years?
He beats the guards all the time, and he pretty much destroyed a prison during a riot and cost england  millions pound.
He sounds like a complete lunatic.
oh yeah that's a fact. He's definitely crazy
when did this movie come out
It came out in 2008. He actually got realsed from prison once for sixty days and went right back to prison

He is definitely  a character. In the movie he said his cell felt like a hotel room with a sink a bed and toilet, and he loves it
