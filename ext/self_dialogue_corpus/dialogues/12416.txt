You'll never guess how much Harrison Ford got paid to be in Star Wars.
I'll guess something small, like $100,000.
You're so wrong.  Think lower?
$50,000?  It couldn't have been much worse.
He was $10,000 and received no royalties?
What?  That's total madness.
Yeah, he only $1,000 a week for filming and did it for ten weeks.
He got totally ripped off.
He made up for it with the other movies and got millions for them though.
I'd be bitter that I got stiffed so much the first time!
