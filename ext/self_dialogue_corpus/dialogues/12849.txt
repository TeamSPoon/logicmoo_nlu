What did you think of the way the Force Awakens played out?
Which part?
Killing Han Solo for one.
I hated that!
I know, it came so sudden.
There was no real build up.
I hated his son in the whole movie.
I know! He was too moody.
I think Leia was really good in that one though.
Very powerful, and strong. So sad that actress passed away.
