But to include that development story would['ve taken the movie over 3 hours. Who knows, maybe they did have the footages, but decided to cut it.
I don't if that's true, but if they did cut it, they made a mistake.
or maybe they didn't have the footages
Then that's just poor planning.
Well, either way, we agree the character of Darth Maul cold've used more development.
Yes. definitely. And he was such an evil creature, it would've been delightful to see his torture, harsh treatment and how he become evil.
That would've been great
More fulfilling to watch and follow the story
yep. Like how he deevlops his telekinesis would've been a great back story
Yeah! That was so evil, i wanted to know that too.
