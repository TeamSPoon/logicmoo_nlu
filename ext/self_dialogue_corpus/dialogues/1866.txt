Hey, when does the football season start?
I think it starts September 10th.
Awesome. Who are you excited to watch?
I'm most excited to watch the Patriots. What about you?
I'm most excited to see how the Cowboys play.
The Cowboys were great last year. Think they can keep it up?
I do think they can do it again. Do you think the Patriots will make it back to the superbowl?
I'm not sure. It would be awesome to see Tom Brady win another ring.
I think Dak Prescott may challenge him this year.
He did play great last year. But we will see if he can keep playing at that caliber.
I think he is an excellent QB and the Cowboys got lucky drafting him.
Yeah. Its not often a new QB can come and play that well in the NFL.
Yeah. I'm positive he will do it again this year and they will make the playoffs.
Wouldn't it be cool if the Patriots played the Cowboys in the superbowl?
That would be fantastic. Think it could happen.
I think the Patriots have a good chance of returning but can the Cowboys win a playoff game?
They are bound to win some with this team. Its only a matter of time.
I will wait and see. But I think this will be an amazing season.
Same here. Can't wait to watch.
Me too. September cant come soon enough.
