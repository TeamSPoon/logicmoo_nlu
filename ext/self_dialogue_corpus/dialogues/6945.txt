Have you seen the previews for the new Car's movie coming out?
I have!  It looks awesome.
I am going to take Brady there when it comes to theatres so he can see it.
I think I will take my kids as well.
It is suppose to be a great kid friendly movie.
I hope Dusty is in it, my son thinks he is awesome.
Is that the yellow airplane?
Yes, dusty is the airplane.
I hope the movie lasts longer than 90 minutes this time.
It is 112 minutes in length so it is a bit longer than the older ones.
