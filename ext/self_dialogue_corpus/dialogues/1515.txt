I love the Fall especially when football starts.
Me too, nothing better than watching football on a Sunday.
I hope the Patriots can pull out another Superbowl win.
Honestly I'm a little sick of the Patriots they always win.
Well you are from Chicago, the Bears haven't done much lately.
I know but either way I'm sick of the same team always winning.
The Patriots have skills though, they earn their victories.
I'll give you that, what Brady pulled off last year was unreal.
It was, I was so nervous the entire game.
Even though I'm sick of them winning they earned that one.
It helped that Atlanta basically choked.
They did, I think they got too comfortable with their lead.
I agree they starting playing really sloppy.
It must have been fun to be in Boston that night.
It was and then next couple of days, the city was going insane.
Maybe one day the Bears will come back!
Remember 1985, they crushed the Patriots in the Superbowl.
Sadly thats the last time they were good.
Hey you never know, either way watching football is so fun.
It is I like the game and the social aspect of watching with friends.
