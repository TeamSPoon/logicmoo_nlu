What is your favorite Disney animation.
Robin Hood.
That was a classic.
I love Baloo as Little John.
He was pretty hillarious.
Prince John was pretty spot on too.
"Hiss, you've hissed your last....hiss!"
Ha! What a great line.
Hiss was pretty funny too.
There were a lot of Jungle Book dupes in that.
