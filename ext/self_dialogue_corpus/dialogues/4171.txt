Have you heard of that show The Usual Suspects?
Yes, it is a classic already.
Well, I just downloaded it. Is it any good?
Very suspenseful, keeps you guessing.
It had the guy from K-Pax, right?
Kevin Spacey, yes.
Is it a mystery?
Sort of, it is more suspenseful. You do not even know the truth until the very end!
It has to be him.
Well, at the end you will see the guy with the limp, no longer has a limp.
