The last Batman vs Superman movie was a turkey.
Agreed.  Why was it so long?
I'm just kind of getting sick of these two and a half hour movies.  Could have cut a whole 30 to 45 minutes from the thing.
Agreed.  I think Zach Snyder is a bit self-serving.
What I don't get is why they cast Ben Affleck.  Totally the wrong choice.
Guess he needed the paycheck.
It should be interesting to see how this leads into Justice League.
I'm a bit scared that they'll butcher that one as well.
Either way, I'll pay my $10 and so will the rest of the world.
Yeah, me too.  Can't miss them either way!
