Wow, you really like Bob Dylan, huh?
Yes, he is my favorite artist ever.
What's your favorite album by him?
I think it's Blood on the Tracks.
When did that come out?
It came out in 1974; it's about his divorce with his wife Sara.
Wow, that sounds really sad!
It is, but the music is really poetic and just connects on a deeper level.
Are any of his hits on that album?
You probably know the song "Tangled Up in Blue" from it.
I like that song! Is that from before or after he went electric?
He actually went electric in 1965 at the Newport Folk Festival.
It's weird that that was so controversial at the time!
I know; folk fans felt betrayed. Pete Seeger threatened to chop the cords of his amp with an ax!
Wow, people were really emotional about music.
Definitely. But loving Bob Dylan the way I do, I can understand it.
How long have you been a fan for?
I've liked him since I was 14, so 13 years now!
Wow, almost half your life!
I guess I was right when I said he'd always be my favorite artist!
