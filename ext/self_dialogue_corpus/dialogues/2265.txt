So who will be the worst teams in the NFL in 2017?
I think the Browns will be bad... again.
Yes, that' a pretty safe bet.
I also think that the Jets will continue to be mediocre.
Do you think that the Chargers will bounce back?
Perhaps, but they need to overhaul their roster.
We will see, what about the Bears?
The Bears will get marginally better, but who knows.
I really hope that the 49ers return to dominance.
They have been garbage since Harbaugh was forced out.
Yeah, I'm not sure what happened there.
Bad management is what happened there.
At least he is successful at Michigan - he was a hell of an NFL coach.
They went to the Superbowl a few years after he joined the league.
Yes, that goes to show how great he is.
I think the 49ers will continue to be bad until they get a new staff.
They need a total rehaul of their culture.
The recent retirings definitely did not help.
That was unfortunate for fans, but good for those players.
I loved them - but we will see come this year.
