Cars three is here, are you going?
I wouldn't miss it, I loved the last movies.
Who are you taking?
I will grab a kid, or even my teenager. He used to love the Cars movies.
What is his favorite character?
There are so many great characters it's hard to choose.
I think I like Mater the best, he is always so lovable.
yeah, he is always getting himself into predicaments.
Lighting McQueen saves the day for him a lot.
Yes, he does, but isn't that what friends are for?
