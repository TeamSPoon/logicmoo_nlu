It's weird, but it seems like every time I become close friends with someone, it turns out they like horror movies.
That's hilarious. Any idea why?
I mean, it must say something about me, right?
Do you even like horror movies.
I do. From time to time. Like, I really liked The Conjuring.
The Conjuring was good. Any others you've seen lately.
Well, I'm not sure if it's a horror movie or its own thing, but Get Out was also pretty great.
Get Out?
Yeah, the movie Jordan Peele directed.
I've heard a lot of great things about that.
It's an intense experience, but the whole audience loved it.
Maybe I should see it.
The whole audience applauded when I saw it in the theatre. That almost never happens.
I think that only happened when I saw Avatar opening weekend.
I actually haven't seen that!
You should. I'm not sure it's as good without the 3D though.
I forgot it was in 3d.
That was what made it so special, I think.
Maybe I can buy a pair of those glasses!
I don't see why not.
