Do you like Deftones?
I love Deftones.
I've got tickets to their show, and I was looking for someone to go with.
I'd love to go.
Have you been a fan for a while?
I've been a fan since they released White Pony.
Isn't that album great?
It's their best album, in my opinion.
What's your favorite track?
My favorite is Passenger. I love the Maynard James Kennan vocals on that track.
How do you feel about their newer stuff?
I mostly like it. Saturday Night Wrist was the album I liked the least post-White Pony.
I'll agree with you on that.
The album just didn't feel like a Deftones album to me. It was kind of a departure from their usual sound.
Their latest album, Gore, was really heavy and I love it.
I don't totally love it, but it did seem like an attempt to return to that heavy sound that they really haven't had since the self-titled album.
Have you ever seen them live before?
No, I haven't.
You're gonna love it. Rise Against is opening up for them.
Really? I like that band too.
