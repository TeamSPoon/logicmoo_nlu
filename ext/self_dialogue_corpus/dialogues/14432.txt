Do you thin Cleveland or Golden State will lose a game before the NBA Finals?
I think San Antonio will take a game from Golden State if Kawhi Leonard returns healthy.
Is Lebron James the G.O.A.T.?
I think so because the bulls were still a great team without Michael and if they had added another superstar when he left, they could've won the championship.
You're crazy Noone could stop MJ.
Lebron is the best and makes his teammates better.
So you think they will beat Golden State?
Heck yeah. Golden state is gonna get bullied all over the court.
Cmon, man. How are they gonna stop KD and Steph?
Steph Curry is the weakest link. He has no defense and they are gonna treat him like a baby.
You see all the open shots Boston had? Do you think Golden State will miss those shots?
There are too many mismatch and they are gonna be so tired after trying to hold defense on Cleveland.
How much you want to bet?
Anything because Lebron is the man. He's unstoppable and when you try to double team him he's kicking it to Love and the only thing you are going to hear is swish.
The only swish I'll be hearing is the ones coming from the three's from KD Klay, Steph, Draymond, Livingston, Iggy. We got too many weapons.
We will see because their hands are going to be full trying to stop us. Draymond is the heart and soul of that team. KD ain't no Alpha Dog. Steph ai'nt no Alpha Dog. Your best players fall when the pressures on.
In the mean time, while we're waiting on that, come and get smashed on the 2k right now.
Ok, I'm gonna show you what the Cavs gonna do in the Finals.
If they get past Boston.
Really, you better be worried about a Leonard if he come back healthy. It'll be the second year in a row ya'll blow a lead.
