What was your favorite part of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban?
I loved the part where they were learning how to stop dementors.
Yeah, that was fun.  Brought a little bit of light hardheartedness.
Plus dementers are pretty cool.  With their long robes and everything.
I also like the fact that you need to eat chocolate to counter act the effects.
Yeah, all I need is more chocolate.
The funniest part was Snape in the dress.
That was classic.
It just went to show how good of a teacher Lupin was.
Yeah, more hands on than others.
