Did you like Beauty and the Beast?
I adored it! I like it more than the original.
The casting was great wasn't it?
Oh yes, it has some of my favorite actors in it!
Emma Watson, Ewan McGregor, Sir Ian McKellen, Emma Thompson etc are some of my all time favorite actors.
Did you watch it in 3D? Because it's even more spectacular on an Imax 3D screen.
I did actually. I loved all the special effects. And the songs too!
Yes, I love how they stayed true to the original, yet made it their own.
That's not easy to do, I agree. Which do you prefer?
Oh, definitely this one. It's fantastic to finally see an adaptation that lives up to the original.
This move felt much longer than the 1991 version. Didn't you think so too?
It is longer. It's 45 minutes longer than the original.
Oh okay. I know that at a budget of $160 million, his was the most expensive musical ever made.
That's staggering, but I can well believe it.
Which is the most hateful character in the movie according to you?
Oh, Gaston without a doubt.
I concur. I especially hate his treatment of Belle.
Yes, I also felt like it was more accentuated in this move.
That's probably because the characters were all real and not animated like in the original.
Yes, undoubtedly, but I would definitely watch it again.
