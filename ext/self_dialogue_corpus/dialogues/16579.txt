Have you seen Gustavo Dudamel yet?
I'm not entirely sure who that is.
He's the conductor of the LA Philharmonic and the Venezuelan Youth Symphony.
Was he on Mozart in the Jungle, briefly?
Yeah, that's him.
The guy with a ton of energy and super crazy hair?
Haha, yes! Isn't he great?
I love the energy and passion he brings into music. It's great to see someone our age in such a high position.
You know he's a conductor that's worth $8 million, right?
Holy crap, seriously?
Yep, I should be a conductor.
I would be a conductor too but I can't.
Why not?
Well, I have bad shoulders. And I hate being in front of people, and responsibility.
You're so cheerful!
Why did you bring him up?
He'll be guest-conducting the Detroit Symphony next month.
Awesome!
Want to go?
Sure, what's the program?
