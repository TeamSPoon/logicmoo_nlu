Did you see that plane scene in the end of fast and furious 5?
Yes, I did.
It seems like it was infinite runway.
Yes, I mean the last 15 minutes was plane running on runway.
They should add that runway to world record.
I don't see such flaws in english movies usually.
Yes, Even I was surprised to see that scene.
But how was the movie otherwise besides that scene?
Well, I haven't seen any movie turn out to be good which has problems with ending.
I agree, A bad ending is usually the entire movie killer.
