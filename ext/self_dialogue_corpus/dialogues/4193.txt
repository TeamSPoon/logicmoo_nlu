Did you see the Book of Henry after all, like you wanted to?
Yeah, I saw it a couple of weeks ago.
Was it as suspenseful as the trailers made it out to be?
No, not at all. It was a kind of confusing movie.
What do you mean?
It wasn't like a straight up thriller like I thought.
What was it then?
Kind of a mix of black comedy, emotional, and a thriller.
Well that sounds weird!
That pretty much sums up the movie. Weird!
