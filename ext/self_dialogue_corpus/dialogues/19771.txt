Do you listen to Gorillaz?
Yeah. I have not gotten the new album yet, though.
Oh, they have a new one out?
Yeah. It's called Humanz.
Oh. Have you read any reviews?
Just a bunch of people on Facebook complaining that the new Gorillaz album doesn't sound like Gorillaz. Those kind of comments are best ignored.
Why?
Because Gorillaz is a collaborative band. It has an ever-changing group of contributing artists and no particular, set-in-stone sound. It is meant to be somewhat fluid.
I see what you mean.
It bothers me that long-time "fans" would diss the album so quickly. The day it came out fans were already complaining. I don't think that's cool. Sometimes you have to let things grow on you.
What's your favorite album?
I love the first album most of all. The one with the song Clint Eastwood and Rock the House.
I like Demon Dayz.
Yeah, that's a good one, too.
I didn't even know that they were still around. I wasn't expecting a new album.
I know. It's been a long time. I'm excited to buy it.
I'm excited to see the new animations.
When I first saw their videos, my mind was totally blown. The animation work is beyond amazing.
I agree. I also really like that their albums are so conceptual and thematic.
Yeah. They are a really fun, creative band. I look forward to seeing and hearing the new stuff.
