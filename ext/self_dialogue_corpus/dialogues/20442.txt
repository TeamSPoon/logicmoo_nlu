Do you remember seeing the movie the Titanic?
Yes! That is the one with Julia Roberts and it is on a giant ship, right?
You got the ship part right, but it was Kate Winslet you were thinking of.
Oh of course. How could I forget that. I love that movie.
Doesn't it seem like it has been years since it came out?
Well it has been, that's why! 18 years I think?
Actually it has been 20! I remember becuase I went on my birthday.
Who was the actor in that movie?
It was Leonardo Decarprio.
He is such a good actor. I loved him in Gangs of New York.
Oh you are right. That is another great movie!
Also, didn't he just do one a few years ago called Wolf on Wallstreet?
I think so. I never saw it but I heard it was good.
Same here. All the reviews I read were great.
Has he done anything recently?
I'm not sure. I remember seeing him in that Quentin Tarantino movie.
Django? That is another golden flick.
Right? Anything that man makes is always great to watch.
I wonder if he is working on anything new?
I think I heard of a new project he has in the works but can't remember what it was.
