What kind of music are you into?
Anything but country.  You?
I am a huge fan of funk and soul.
Really? What's some good modern day funk?
Yes.  Well one can start with Lettuce.
Lettuce, huh?  How's that?
Lettuce has a powerful, full sound which is a full onslaught of funk.
What kind of instruments are involved?
A brass section, guitars, drums, keys and some vocals.
Awesome.  Do you like P-funk?
Of course I do!  Have you ever seen them live?
I have not, but would love to.  You?
Yes, on a couple of occasions.
How was it?
Incredible!  George Clinton is amazing.
Atomic Dawg?
Oh yeah, that's the jam.  He played it.
Ah, sounds like a good time.
It was.  Good chatting with you about music.
You as well, enjoy the funk.
