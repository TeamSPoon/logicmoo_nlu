Do you like Disney movies?
Of course I do!
What is your favorite?
I'd have to say the Lion King.
Did you see they are making a live action version?
I heard that. Do you know when it is coming out?
Not until 2019.
Oh, that's when the new Frozen movie is coming out too.
Disney definitely plans ahead.
With all the animation and editing necessary, I'm sure they have to.
