Have you seen the latest Underworld Movie , Blood Wars ?
Actually yes I did, riveting , and outstanding movie. What was your favorite part?
Best part for me is when,  Selene (Kate Beckinsale)   went into the water and then came back out this whole new woman.
She has been a great death dealer thus far. Do you feel they will be making a new one after Blood Wars?
I mean they have to , writers just left us hanging, What about her daughter? I really would like to know more about her, and what she has been up to.
I feel like the story line is just real good SCI-Fi  action packed dialogue  I doubt the writers would just leave us like that . There has to be another one coming out.
What was the directors name again?
I believe the director is Anna Foerster, she helped direct   White House Down with  Roland Emmerich.
Roland Emmerich has directed a lot  of  great movies, I cried in The Patriot.
Yes The Patriot, wasn't Mel Gibson in that movie?
Yes he was good actor, best movie I like of his is The Ransom.
Yes he also dabbled in being a director as well . Remember The Passion of Christ, that grossed about 210 million the first night I think.
Oh my Gosh The Passion Of Christ gave me a whole new outlook on Jesus Christ, broke my heart!
Mel Gibson really captured our loving savior's Story like no other has. The scene where Jesus was tortured really compelling.
My favorite scene was when , His mother was going crazy for her son but there was nothing she could do for he was called upon God to fulfill  his duties has The Only Begotten Son.
Who played Mother Mary?
Maia Emilia Ninel Morgenstern she is a Romanian film and stage actress.
Superb actress really captured her character.
I wonder if she made other movies with similar character roles.
Who played Pontius Pilate ?
