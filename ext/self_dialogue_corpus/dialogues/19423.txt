Hey have you heard the lates from lindsey sterling.
No what is her latest album.
She is going on tour pretty soon if it hasn't already started. It called brave enough.
What kind of music does she play.
Its like classical but very upbeat. I think she does a pretty good show.
Is there a stage show or just the band.
Yes there is a stage show. She dances a lot and there are back up dancers as well and a nice stage setting.
I have not heard of her until now.
I found out about her listening to 2 cellos.
Who are they?
Another classical band I listen to. Not really classical but instrumental.
You like instrumental music a lot?
Yes I do it lets me think without having lyrics to think about its better i can enjoy the music and concentrate on what i am doing.
I never thought of that. I like loud heavy metal music because it stimulates me.
Yes but it hard to concentrate with all the noise in the back ground. And I can hardly make out what they are saying.i know sometime I have to concentrate on the lyrics to under stand them.
Not always but sometimes.
Also its difficult to explain things to people with that kind of music in the back ground.
I just turn it down when somebody wants to talk to me.
Well good talking to you ill see you soon
Same here later
