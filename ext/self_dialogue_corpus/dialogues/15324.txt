Have you ever heard of Pete Wentz?
He plays bass, right?
Yes, he is a member of the band Fall Out Boy.
I read an article once that said that Pete writes all of the lyrics for the band.
It's true. He does.
But Patrick Stump is the lead singer, right?
Yes, he is the lead singer and the rhythm guitarist.
The band is from Chicago, correct?
Yes, you're right. They got their start there and now are internationally known.
What was their first big song?
The first song they put out that got very popular was called "Grand Theft Autumn"
And then their next big hit was Sugar, We're Going Down?
Yes, but I think their biggest song is a different track though
What song is that?
Centuries! That song has been used in television and in commercials so many times
The band gets paid every time that happens, don't they?
Yes indeed. The companies have to license the song and give the band money.
I think I heard that song in a television promo for College Football last year.
I would not be surprised. ESPN uses that song all the time.
I wonder when the next big license for that song will happen.
