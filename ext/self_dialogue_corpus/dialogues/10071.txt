What is your favorite action movie?
I love Die Hard.
That's a great film!
Yeah, especially since it's a great Christmas movie.
Hahaha, that's so true.
What's your favorite action movie?
I'm a big fan of The Mummy actually.
Really? What do you think about Tom Cruise being in the new one then?
I'm sad because I love Brendan Fraser.
Yeah, but I bet he'll take the action to the next level.
