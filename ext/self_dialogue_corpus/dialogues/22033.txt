I seen the new Tarintino movie, and it made me watch some of his older ones.
Like Pulp fiction?
John Travolta was insane in that one.
It is a cult classic.
I do not know too many films like that.
There is one you might like, called Donny Darko.
Who is in that one?
Jake Gylnhaal is the star.
Is it a romance?
Not really, more of a dark fantasy.
I like dark shows.
Then Fight Club might be the perfect film for you.
I seen that, with Brad Pitt?
Yep. Let' see, ever seen The Rocky Horror Picture show?
I have heard of it. What is it about.
It is hard to explain, but aliens and corss dressers, and music.
Oh, who is in it?
Tim Curry is the main guy, but also Meatload and Susan Surrandin, to name a few.
I seen they remade it.
The classic is far better.
