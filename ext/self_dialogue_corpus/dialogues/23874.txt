How do you feel about war movies?
That's probably my least favourite genre of movies, though there is one I kinda like.
Which one?
Friendly Persuasion.
I'm not familiar with it.
Well, it's not as much a war movie as some, mainly because it's centered around a Quaker family, but it does take place during the American civil war.
Interesting... Anybody good in it?
Yeah, Gary Cooper and Dorothy McGuire, oh and a young Anthony Perkins!
Nice! I've always liked movies I've seen Dorothy McGuire in.
Well this is a great one. In fact, one of your presidents, Reagan, liked it so much he shared a copy with the Soviet premier.
Wow, I didn't know.
I like it because there are very few movies I find that depict Quakers in the face of war. There are some factual errors in it but it's overall very good.
Do you have a favourite scene?
Not a specific scene, but I like the relationship between the youngest boy and his sister. It's so funny.
Who knew a movie about Quakers in war would be funny?
Well I'm not saying whether they get involved in the war or not, but it is actually a pretty humorous movie. Not that the writers put jokes in it or anything, but in the way the characters are they're funny.
I think I can see what you mean.
I definitely think the humor is balanced by some very sober and serious scenes.
That's good. It is taking place during a war after all.
Yes, it can be very thought-provoking, too.
