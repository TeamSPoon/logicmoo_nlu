How do you feel about country music?
I mean its not all that bad.
Yeah its not all that bad, its all that terrible.
I would not go that far.
I mean it sounds absolutely like dreck most of the time you hear it.
No, thats not true it sounds more like old fashioned music.
No I think that the themes in the music are over wrought most of the time.
With what?
Just downhearted and depressed lyrics.
Dont say its all about losing women.
No its all about how down to earth those guys are.
Maybe they are salt of the earth people.
Except they arent.
How so?
In that they make millions of dollars, they have no idea.
They werent born millionaires.
So then they are writing about a past life that they havent experienced in years
Some bands always do that.
Like who
Blink 182 cant be still failing at love. They are all married with children.
