Have you ever seen the Return of the Jedi?
Many times. It is defintely one of my all time favorite movies.
Can you help explain to me why the Emperor dies when Darth Vader throws him down the shaft on the Death Star?
I've wondered that myself. It seems that the Jedi and Sith could survive almost everything.
I was thinking that exactly the same. In the Attack of the Clones, Annakin jumps out of a vehicle and falls thousands of feet.
Yes that's a great point. My only thought is that Palpatine must have ignited an explosion.
Oh right, because there is that huge blue fireball that comes back up the shaft.
Yes, so that is my thought: that he must have hit some fuel cell with his force lightning which ignited a huge explosion.
Great thanks! I was wondering why he couldn't survive a "little" fall like that.
No worries. That seems to be the best explanation that I can think of.
