What do you think of Sign of the Times?
The One Direction song?
No, it's Harry Styles on his solo career.
Oh, right. Umm, it's kind of whiney
How so?
It ... sounds like he's whining constantly
Maybe it's about feeling bad about the current state of things.
Politcally?
No, not everything is political. Emotional, life.
Oh, well, I still don't like it.
