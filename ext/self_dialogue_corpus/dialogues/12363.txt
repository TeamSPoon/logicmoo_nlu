Is it true that Gary Kurtz left after Empire?
Yes, he did not want to do another attack on the death star movie and him and Lucas left each other
That is interesting.
Yeah. He wanted Luke to ride off into the sunset at the end too.
That would have been cooler
I agree
I did not like the Ewoks.
They were okay, but they did not belong in Star Wars
Do you think Gary Kurtz left cause of them too?
Maybe. That seems like it would be one of the reasons.
