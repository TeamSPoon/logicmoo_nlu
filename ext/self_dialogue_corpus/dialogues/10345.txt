Are you a fan of the Die Hard movies?
I used to be but it's been so long since I've seen one of them. I saw the one where they foiled the Russians' plans.
Oh that's the one where Bruce Willis spent the entire time with a headache.
Yes it really made you feel his pain. He's just a great action star all around.
Have you seen him in Pulp Fiction?
Of course I have. Loved him in that too.
Quentin Tarantino is an excellent action director. Have you seen Kill Bill?
I most certainly have. My favorite scene in part 1 is when she went on a killing spree in that club where O-Ren Ishii was.
That was a killer scene, literally. No holds barred there.
I heard they made most of that scene black and white because there was too much gratuitous blood.
