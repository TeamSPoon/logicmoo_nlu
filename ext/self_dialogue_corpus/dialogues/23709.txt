Have you seen any good movies lately?
Yes, I saw Manchester By The sea.
When did you see that one
I rented it at the house.
I heard that it was a very sad movie.
It was a sad movie. Very tragic.
What was so tragic about it?
The theme of the movie surround death and finding ways to cope with death.
I guess that would be a tragic theme. Who did you watch the movie with?
I watched it with my parents.
Knowing you I bet there were tears running down your face.
You know me all to well. It was so sad, death of children and a parent and moving forward even when you do not want to.
I think I may rent this one, do not tell me any more.
Just make sure that you have a box of tissues on hand.
Who was in the movie?
Casey Affleck was one of the main characters and there were many other popular but older actors who had small parts.
Casey Affleck? Is he related to Ben Affleck?
That was the same question I asked. Of course you know my parents, movie buffs, they knew exactly who he was.
Has he played in any other movies?
I do not know but I would like to watch another one of his movies, maybe one which was not so tragic.
