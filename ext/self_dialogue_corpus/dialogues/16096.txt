You know what I miss? Doowop music.
Like the 1940's and 50's type stuff?
Exactly, that stuff had a different feel to it.
Yea, it was terrible haha.
No it wasn't! How can you not like classics?
Like what?
Little Bitty Pretty One?
Okay, I do like that song, but the rest are terrible.
Have you heard of Harry Belefonte?
Sounds vaguely familiar.
Day O, me say Dayyyyy O! That was him.
Oh okay! I like that song too!
I'll bet you like a lot of others one too.
I'm starting to think so myself. What else is there?
do you like Mr. Sandman?
That one is ok, is it really classified as Doowop though?
Of course it is!
Okay okay, don't get upset, I'm not as familiar with this genre as you are.
Well you should listen more to it, sounds like you might actually like it.
Will do, I'm definitely interested!
