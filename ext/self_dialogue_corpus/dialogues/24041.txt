Did you see Dazed and Confused?
Yes
Did you like it?
I loved it
I felt like the characters were my friends
I know what you mean
The whole move you just hang out with them
Yeah and you did not know what was gonna happen next
I liked the way that move messed with structure
Yes. You could not tell when the beginning and end was. It was not guessable.
I agree 100 percent.
Did you see it in theaters?
Yes
You are lucky. I was too young to see it.
It was cool cause it was set in the 70's and it was a 90's movie.
Kind of like Grease
Exactly
What was your favorite part in Dazed and Confused?
I loved the scene where the freshman got Ben Affleck back
I didn't even know he was in that.
