Eleven months ago Rag'n' Bone Man put out a song named Human.  Have you heard it?
Yes, I did.  Do you know which music Genre it is in?
I think it is in Pop.
I heard that it is in the debut album for Rag'n' Bone Man.
It is also on "You Tube."
I absolutely love his sound.
Where is Rag'n'Bone Man from?
I will have to Goggle him.
He is from England.
Did you know that he is not only Pop but he come us in soul and the blues.
I really love his sound.
I also learned that his real name is:  Rory Charles Graham.
Who knew!
So I noticed that his hit song "Human" actually hit the charts in Austria, Germany, Belgium and Switzerland.
While I only just learned of him he has been out there in the music world for a little time.
Did you know he was born in 1985?
Sounds like he is someone to watch.  We can expect some great tunes from him in the future.
I hope you are correct.  I would hate for him to be one of those "one hit wonders."
Think I will go to you tube and look at the video associated with the "Human" tract.
Me too.  Enjoy!
