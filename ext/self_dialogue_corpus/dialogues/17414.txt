What do you think the best type of music is?
When I think of the best kind of music I think of songs with no lyrics to them.
You mean you like instrumentals?
Yeah, I love instrumentals.
Would you always pick lyricless music over anything else?
I wouldn't say all the time but I prefer my music to not have any lyrics in it.
Why?
Well I think instrumentals really bring out your emotions more than songs with lyrics?
I think songs with lyrics can do the same thing.
Well they can but it's easier because you can say a bunch of things that would envoke an emotion.
So why do you feel it;s better with instrumentals?
Well if a song can bring out an emotion in you without needing to say any words then you know the song is good.
I never thought of it that way, that makes a lot of sense.
Another reason I like them is because there are multiple benfits to listening to it.
Benefits? Like what?
Well the main one for me is productivity. It helps me focus on work when I have something playing in the back ground.
Interesting. I never knew that.
Yeah. Another plus for me personally is it sets up my mood.
Your mood?
Yeah, if I play something upbeat I am pretty chipper throughout the day.
