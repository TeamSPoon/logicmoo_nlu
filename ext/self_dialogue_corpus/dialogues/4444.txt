Would you consider Fight Club a thriller?
I could argue for and against that claim.
Well I think its a thriller because you are waiting to see whats going on
It had one of the best plot twists I have ever seen.
Yeah Edward Norton and Brad Pitt did such a good job in it.
I think their acting made it such a good twist
I didnt see them being the same character.
And the rest of the cast was great too
Leto played a great role
Yeah he did and I loved it.
