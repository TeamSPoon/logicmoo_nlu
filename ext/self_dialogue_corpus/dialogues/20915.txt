I saw a Vin Diesel movie the other day and now I can't remember what it was.
Do I need to help jog your memory?
Yes, please do.
Okay.  Did it have cars in it?
It was not a Fast and the Furious movie if that's what you're getting at.
Okay.  Was he an action hero star.
Kind of.  He had special abilities.
Was it the newer XXX movie that came out?
No, he was a guy who couldn't be killed and hunted witches.
Oh, you're talking about The Last Witch Hunter.
Yes!  That's the one.  I kind of feel dumb now since the title was a dead giveaway.
That was a surprisingly good movie.  Critics hated it, I didn't.
It had some good setpieces.  And I love me some Michael Caine.
I actually liked how Elijah Wood ended up being a bad guy.
Yeah, that was a good twist and out of character for him.
It was a bit odd how the Witch Hunter had so much money.
You mean how we drove around a super nice car?
Yeah.  You would think he would keep a lower profile.
I get it.  Maybe they should have got him a Honda Accord instead.
Exactly.  But they could still make it black to get some coolness.
