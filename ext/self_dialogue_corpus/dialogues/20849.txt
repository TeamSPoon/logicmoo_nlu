I always thought that Milo and Otis was a cute movie.
Really? That is the one with the cat and dog.
Yes.
It was a Japanese movie I believe and took three years to edit it.
Wow, that is a long time.
Dudley Moore narrated it.
Well I read that their was a lot of animal cruelty in it.
I heard that as well.
Supposedly they put the animals in dangerous situations and many of them died.
I heard that there were over 30 cats used in the movie.
That is horrible isn't it?
Yes it is.
I feel so bad for the  animals.
Me too.
I will never watch it again.
My kids loved that movie too.
So did mine.
Well I don't understand why they need to hurt animals during the making of a film.
Me either.
It is really sad.
