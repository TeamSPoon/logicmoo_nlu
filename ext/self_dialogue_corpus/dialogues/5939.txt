The new Descendants movie is coming out soon.
I heard. We liked the first one.
Not sure where they will go with this one.
Maybe there will be more focus on the Island of the Lost?
True, that was not the focus of the first movie.
I felt like it was really popular at my house but overall I am not sure how many people got into it.
Well, I know we will have to go and see it!
Us too.
I hope the music is just as good as it was in the first one.
Rotten to the Core was a great song.
