Nothing beats old school rap but there are a few new artists that I can respect.
Do you think rap lyrics are better or worse now?
I believe they are worse and should rap about better topics.

I like fast rap because it is challenging to rap and learn the lyrics.

yes but I also enjoy a little bit of everything.
Where do you think Tupacs rap style would be if he were still alive?
I think he would be into world topics.
