Who do you think is the worst character in all of the Star Wars movies?
Jar Jar Binks is obviously the worst.  He character was so cheesy.
I definitely disliked his whole storyline. It could have been handled much differently.
Did you know that Michael Jackson was originally supposed to play Jar Jar?
No way! That would have been creepy.
Maybe it would have made it better?
Nothing could have made that character better in my opinion.
What if he didn't talk in that crazy voice?
That would have definitely helped, I was kind of annoyed with how all of the Gungans talked.
Maybe its that whole species that just needed to be redone.
