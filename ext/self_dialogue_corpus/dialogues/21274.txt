Have you ever seen the movie "Never Been Kissed"?
Is that the movie with Drew Barrymore and she poses as a High School student?
Yes, that's it. Did you like it?
I did. I'm a big fan of Drew Barrymore.
I am, too. Did you see "Ever After"? That's one of my favorites with her in it.
I love that movie, too. Anjelica Huston was awesome in it as well.
I thought the writers stayed true to the original story of Cinderella, and I liked that.
I did, too. I thought the costumes were beautiful. You can tell they put a lot of effort into making that movie.
What types of movies do you like?
Mostly comedies, I also like suspense and horror.
Have you seen "I know what you did last summer"?
I have, it's a decent movie.
I read the book in High School so I decided to watch the film. I enjoyed it.
Jennifer Love-Hewitt was great in it. I thought Freddie Prince Jr. was terrible.
Really? Why?
His acting in that movie wasn't believable to me. I felt like it was forced, his acting didn't come naturally.
What about Sarah Michelle Gellar and Ryan Philippe in their roles?
They were excellent. Ryan was seriously believable in his role as the jock. What a jerk his character was!
I thought the killer was creepy. The raincoat and hook made him look extra scary.
I agree, very scary!
