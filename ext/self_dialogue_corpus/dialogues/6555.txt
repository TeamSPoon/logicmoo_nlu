My kids watched Mary Poppins for the first time yesterday, while they were sick.
That is a great movie!
Yes. It really stands the test of time.
I think it was Dick Van Dyke's greatest performance.
Julie Andrews is amazing too.
I always thought Mary Poppins and Bert were boyfriend and girlfriend, but I heard a theory that she was actually Bert's governess.
I've heard that theory too, but it doesn't feel right to me, you know?
Yes, it doesn't feel like that kind of relationship to me either.
Anyway, now my kids are begging me to add sugar to their children's Tylenol.
As kids, I'm pretty sure we begged for that that too.
