I just re-watched Bat Man last night.
Which one.
The first one.
With Keaton.
Yup.
The best one, in my opinion.
I liked the second one too...
Yeah, a bit of a toss up.
Nicholson or Davito.
That's what it really boils down to.
I just love Keaton though.
Yeah, it's funny that he was cast for that role.
True. When it first came out I was a little unsure.
But he does so well.
He's really got that whole Wayne bruding thing.
I could'nt agree more.
We should watch the second one together.
I'm free tonight.
6ish?
Perfect!
