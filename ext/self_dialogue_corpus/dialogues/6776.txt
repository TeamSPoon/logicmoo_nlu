I can't believe they are releasing another Toy Story.
I thought the last one was the final one?
Nope!  They are making another one.  It's coming out next year.
What could the storyline possibly be?
I think it's about how Woody and Bo Beep fall in love.
Oh, okay.  I guess that's alright.  Still, I think they need to just end it.
I know!  It's hard to believe the first one was out when I was a kid.
It's crazy to think about several generations of people loving the same franchise.
I guess that's how you know a movie is really great.
Yes, it's has a timeless quality to it.
