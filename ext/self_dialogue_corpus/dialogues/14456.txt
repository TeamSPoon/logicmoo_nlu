Hey, did you watch the Warrior/Spurs game last night?
Yes, not surprised to see the Warriors win again.
Kevin Durant was on fire.
He is amazing to watch as he can drive to the hoop or hit a 3 pointer.
Who would you rather have on your team, James or Durant?
Wow, what a question. I would take Durant because he is younger.
Crazy to see that Cleveland and Golden State are undefeated in the playoffs.
Absolutely as they are both 10 and 0.
Who do you thing will win the NBA title.
I would put my money on Cleveland.
I watched some of the Cleveland game the other night and I was just shocked to see how much James gets away with on the court.
I know. I watched him run over a guy, take six steps, run over a second guy and dunk it with no foul called.
Have you heard anything about the growth hormone James is supposedly taking?
Only that it builds muscle without going to the gym.
I am guessing one of these days the NBA will outlaw such a supplement.
Those players not using the supplement are at a disadvantage.
What team do you think is on the verge of really getting good?
I think my pick would be the Milwaukee Bucks.
Why do you think they are your guess.
Because they have a 7 foot 2 guy they call the Greek freak who can handle the ball, shoot 3's and drive past other 7 footers.
