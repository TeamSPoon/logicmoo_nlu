Did you see fox sports over under predictions for NFL teams this year?
Do you mean wins and losses?
Yes. They put a win total up and predict if the team will win more or less.
I haven't seen it yet.
They have the falcons going under ten wins.
Wow that's surprising.
I thought so too.
What do they have New England doing?
They have them going over 11 wins.
That's a good possibility.
How about the Cowboys?
They have them going over 9.5 wins.
That's a tough division.
Yes. They have the Giants going over 9 wins.
The Giants could have a big year.
Their defense is great!
It should be even better.
Yes it should be.
They have to protect Eli.
Yes they do
