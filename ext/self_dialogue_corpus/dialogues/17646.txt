Have you heard the news about Radiohead releasing a 20th anniversary edition of OK Computer?
Oh wow, that's one of my favorite records of all time!
It has 3 songs that have never been released before. I'm excited to hear the song "Lift."
That's great news. They have some fantastic experimental B-sides that never made the cut for that album.
I've already pre-ordered the vinyl. We should throw a listening party when I get it.
Alright. Do you have a favorite Radiohead album?
I'm old school so my favorite is The Bends.
I can dig that. I think my favorite is Kid A - I really like the electronic sound.
They've certainly evolved over the years into new genres. Sometimes it gets a little too out there for my tastes.
Another artist like that is Bjork. Here early stuff was a lot more melodic but then it just got weirder and weirder.
I'm a fan of hers. Did you know she even recorded a duet with Thom Yorke from Radiohead?
I know that one. It was called "I've Seen It All" from the soundtrack to her movie Dancer in the Dark.
Bjork's definitely had an interesting career. I think it's hard for an artist to stay fresh and surprising over many decades.
Her music videos have also been some of the most creative over the years. I really like the one for "Human Behavior."
Speaking of creative videos, Gorillaz is back with a new album called Humanz.
Oh cool, they are an awesome band. I love the concept of having animated characters playing their songs.
I say there is also room for more weirdness in pop music to keep pushing back from the commercial aspect.
It's a shame David Bowie passed away - he really paved the way in terms of blurring the line between fantasy and reality with his musical persona.
Thankfully there are new artists taking up his mantle. Some people may not like Lady Gaga but at least she is exploring the boundaries of art.
You said it. I think the future of music is going to be an exciting journey.
