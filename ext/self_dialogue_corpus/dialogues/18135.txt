what is your favorite rock anthem song?
Is satisfaction by the stones considered an anthem?
I think so.Hugely popular.
I think it may be their most popular song.
Well it may be super iconic either way.
So that is my pick them.
So many people have covered this tune too, but the stones do it best!
Obviously!  Who do you think did the worst cover of it?
Hands down britney spears.
I didn't know she covered it!
More like butchered it.
I am not too surprised.
YA, she chopped it up in a way that was just so off from the essence of the melody.
I will have to find a version to listen to .
Honestly it was so bad I would advise you not to bother.
Fair enough, thanks, I will stick to the original.
I did enjoy a cover of it in a movie.
What movie.
Can't think of the name but with angelina jolie, she is a workaholic and it is kind of a breakout moment for her.
I think I recall this, she is a broadcaster in the film. It was a good scene.
