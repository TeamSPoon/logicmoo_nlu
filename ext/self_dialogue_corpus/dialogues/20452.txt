Do you think they will ever remake To Catch a Thief? It has been a long time.
That is an oldie isn't it? Who was in that one?
Cary Grant and Grace Kelly stared in it. It was from the golden age of movies but I would love to see a new spin on it.
I cannot imagine who could fill those shoes. That is like recasting Casablanca.
I admit it would be hard to do, but I miss movies like that. I also miss stars with charisma like that.
Is that your favorite Cary Grant movie? I love Hitchcock's Notorious myself.
Oh yes, that was with Ingrid Bergman wasn't it. That was a wonderful black and white movie.
Yes and much more typical of Hitchcock. He was a brilliant director.
I have not seen a few of his classics, The Birds and Psycho look too intense for me.
You must have seen Vertigo and Rear Window. They were thrillers but not too intense.
Yes, I saw both of those. I loved Jimmy Stewart in Rear Window.
He was amazing. You cannot beat It's A Wonderful Life if you are a Jimmy Stewart fan.
That was one of my favorite movies of all time. What a priceless message.
I have thought of that movie many times in my life. There is something for everyone in that movie.
They have remade it several times, but nothing has ever touched the original. They didn't even come close.
No they missed the mark. Maybe that is why they don't do other classics, it is just too hard to fill those shoes.
I think the best thing to do if you love the old classics is to go out and buy them. I do not think you can replace directors and actors like those.
It might be fun to see them do High Noon. I would love to see a modern version of a western classic.
I love Gary Cooper movies. High Noon and Sabrina were my favorites.
Oh come on, you have to put Sargent York on that list. That was a great movie.
