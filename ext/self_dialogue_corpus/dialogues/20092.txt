Hey, what was the last movie you watched on Netflix?
I re-watched Forrest Gump the other night.
Oh, what? That's on Netflix now?
Yeah! It's a classic. Every time it's on tv, I have to watch it. Well, it turns out that's true of me seeing it on Netflix too. What about you?
Haha yeah. I watched the latest Adam Sandler movie on Netflix the other night with my girlfriend.
Are you serious? You liked it and him?
No, he's actually pretty horrible, but there was nothing else to do and she wanted to watch it?
What was it about?
I don't honestly remember, because it was so bad. It was just a bunch of really inappropriate jokes. It had David Spade in it though and I do find him to be funny.
Oh! I like David Spade. Another movie I can't bypass is Joe Dirt!
Oh yeah - definitely - that movie is hilarious. I have to watch that when it's on tv too.
That movie really needs to be on Netflix.
Have you seen any movies in the theaters lately?
No, the last movie I saw was Finding Dorry.
I think that might have been the last movie I saw too. I did watch Jackie on a flight though.
I saw that too - that was actually a pretty good movie!
Yeah, the thing I wonder about is how factual it is though.
I did too. It would be interesting to see a historians take on the movie and out what is true and what is false.
Any movies you're excited for? I'm hoping the Fast and Furious movies just stop sometime soon. They should have been done about a decade ago, at least.
The Smurfs movie will be cute, but yeah, I couldn't agree more on the Fast and Furious movies. Those are horrible.
