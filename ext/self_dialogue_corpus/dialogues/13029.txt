So midichorians are basically mitochondria, right?
Yeah, ugh. I guess that's not... too well-hidden.
What's the theory there? Mitochondria produce all the energy for cells, right?
Yeah, but... I don't know that this bears much scrutiny.
Bear with me, though. So the midichlorians produce an energy that's present in everyone, but Jedi are busting with the things.
Okay, so... this is sounding a little like Parasite Eve now.
I guess, but -- no. I'm saying that Jedi are just pumping out this heavy aura of energy on a cellular level that, if trained, can do all kinds of wacky stuff.
Okay. So... I guess that's kind of reconciling the Episode One business with the original explanation then?
Yes, exactly! I mean, sort of. Everyone embodies the Force, and theoretically could learn to control it -- but Jedi are sort of freaks who produce way more of the Force, so when they're trained it's way more effective.
There's a weird class issue here, or maybe even a eugenic model, that disturbs me on a pretty deep level.
