Do you consider The Mask to be a superhero movie?
Oooh, that one is tough. I'm not sure.
I don't think it is. He doesn't have any super powers.
Yeah, the powers are the mask. It's more of a magic movie.
It's listed as a superhero flick though.
I'll buy it as one, but with reservations.
He's barely a hero, too. He's kind of a jerk the whole film, and it's too silly.
Plus, the focus is on the mask. If Iron Man was all about the armor, or if they did a movie entirely on Thor's hammer, then it would be the same.
Well, Black Widow and Hawkeye are superheroes but they don't have any powers.
True, but they're highly-trained assassins. Jim Carrey's character is not.
