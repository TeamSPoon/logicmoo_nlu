kendrick or kanye?
which is a better artist?
yes.
thats a very difficult question.
how come?
kanye produces whereas kendrick does not.
and kendrick is a better lyricist
kanye is mediocre as a lyricist but hes got such a good ear for music.
kendrick pushes the bar in terms of rap.
kanye pushed the bar on every album though!
all of his albums sounds different.
i think kanye is more influential.
i agree
kendrick just does what he does and that is rap.
he can rap very, very well
but he is not doing anything new really.
is kanye?
808s. nuff said.
that is true.
yup
