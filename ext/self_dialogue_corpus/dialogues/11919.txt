I am so glad that iTunes finally has the Beatles music.
Me too! I used to have to switch to a different app when I wanted to listen to them, which was annoying.
What is your ultimate favorite Beatles track?
That is a hard question; there are so many great ones! Maybe Ob-La-Di Ob-La-Da?
Yes, Ob-La-Di is so good! I'm actually not sure what it is about though.
Me either, I just like song! What is your favorite?
Probably Strawberry Fields Forever, another Beatles song that I'm not totally sure what the meaning is.
Strawberry Fields Forever is good, not my favorite though.
What about Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds?
Oh, I love Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds! My best friend is named Lucy, and that song always makes me think of her.
