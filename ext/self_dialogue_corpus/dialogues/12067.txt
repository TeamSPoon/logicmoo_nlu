Do you think Rey is one of the Skywalker kids?
No, I do not.
Then why does she have the force?
Maybe she is a new breed of Jedi, maybe something like Anakin was.
What was he?
He was half force and half human, he was made with metachlorins.
The things the force is made up of?
Yes, when Qui Con Gin was speaking to his mom about his skills, she told him that.
And he thought that possible?
No, actually, but he tested him. Anakin's blood was off the chart with metachlorins.
