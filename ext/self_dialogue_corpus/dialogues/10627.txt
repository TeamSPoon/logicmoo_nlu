Do you have a favorite actor by any chance?
Yes, and mine just happens to be Vin Diesel.
Let me guess, is it because of the Fast & Furious films.
You guessed correctly. Those really sold me on his acting ability.
I think those movies are so overrated.
I can understand that. They're incredibly popular.
Yeah, and because of that, so many people see them as film masterpieces.
That does get annoying rather quickly.
Keep in mind, though. I never said I didn't like them.
Oh, I understand.
