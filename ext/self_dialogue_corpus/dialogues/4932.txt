Who do you think has the best team in the American League?
For sure the Yankees
No way they have no pitching and minimal hitting
Well who do you think is the best
The Red Sox are going to dominate the rest of the season
Why do you think that the Sox are good
One of the best starting pitching staff if not the best
Yea but their in third place whats so good about that
The hitting hasn't come around yet so they haven't supported the starters
They scored double digit runs over the weekend
I know hopefully that will start a trend
I think they have a great closer too but I still think the Yankees will beat them
How about we put up a bet who ever is right gets a free meal at any restaurant
Sure thing but I'm not sure where I will be choosing once the Yankees take first place
Oh don't waste your time worrying about something that won't happen
Haha we should get tickets the next time the two play each other
Sounds like a plan to me I'll check out the schedule later on
I'll be wearing my pin stripe shirt and yankees hat
And I will be taking pictures of you looking like a fool.
Can't wait go Yankees stop the sox.
