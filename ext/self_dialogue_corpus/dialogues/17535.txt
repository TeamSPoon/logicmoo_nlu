What's your opinion on Kayne West's music?
I think a lot of his music is good but a fair amount of it is bad too.
Do you consider him mediocre then?
I wouldn't go that far, the guy obviously has some talent but I wouldn't consider him great.
I wouldn't consider his music good at all.
Really? You don't like any of his work?
I won't say I don't like any of his works but I find about 90% of his music to be terrible.
That is an extremely high amount. Why do you feel that way?
Well I think most of his good songs are just samples of others. i don't feel that is very creative.
That is valid, a lot of artists that sample music from others are often considered untalented.
Thats not all, I also feel most of his music is just a bunch of songs designed to hype himself.
I can see why you'd say that, he does have a lot of music in which he talks about himself like he is a god or something.
Exactly it's pretty obnoxious but people seem to eat it up.
I know, you should see what hardcore fans say to defend him.
I don't even want to know because I know it's already dumb.
It is, but back to his music what songs do you like from him.
I like the song where he sampled Daft Punk's "Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger".
I liked that one too, it was mainstream but it was still pretty good.
I don't care if a song is mainstream or not as long as it sounds good.
I'm a bit against mainstream songs because you hear it so much you get tired of it.
