How about last night's game between the New York Yankees and the Chicago Cubs?
Crazy! I can't believe it went 18 innings.
Did you know the Yankees and Cubs set a record in that game?
Most strikeouts in an MLB game ever. Amazing.
The Cubs seem to be struggling a bit more than I had expected them to this year.
Haha, a new World Series losing streak has got to start somewhere, right?
I'm pleasantly surprised by how well the Arizona Diamondbacks are doing this year.
Yeah, they got Greinke last year. Looks like he's settled in nicely.
Too bad it took a whole season before this. Diamondbacks bullpen in general seems improved.
They're a nice young team. Could be very competitive if things continue to go their way.
The Diamondbacks have Goldschmidt at first base. He's a great guy.
Indeed! Gold Glover, All-Star... would love to see him get a World Series ring with that team.
How about those San Francisco Giants, eh?
Man, the Giants are terrible this year. I swear they should hire clowns off the street to pitch for them.
Speaking of pitching, did you see the Cubs' Miguel Montero pitch the other night?
Position players pitching is one of my favorite things in baseball.
Of all the Cubs pitchers who pitched that night, only Montero pitched a scoreless inning.
Ha! Cubs should pay him more money for playing as a catcher and a pitcher.
So, who do you think will win the World Series this year?
I'm going to go out on a limb and say the Mets. Just because they've been terrible so far and it would be an amazing turn around.
