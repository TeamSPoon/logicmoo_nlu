What is your favorite George Lucas movie?
I have no idea there are so many good ones to choose from, maybe Star Wars?
Star Wars is a classic, but I prefer Indiana Jones.
What was your favorite movie of the Indiana Jones series?
I would have to go with the Temple of Doom.
Yeah that was a great movie, I would say it is my favorite too/
What about your favorite Star Wars Movie?
I like the original Star Wars that was released in the 70's.
Really? Over the new ones like The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones?
Yeah I agree that they may have better graphics, but I like Harrison Ford.
With so many great movies it is no suprise George Lucas has made a lot of money.
Definitely although he sold the rights to his movies he is worth 5.1 billion dollars.
How many movies did the Star Wars series end up making?
There were a total of 8 made and there is one more that is going to be released in 2019.
Oh I did not know that.
Yeah it should be really interesting to see how the trilogy ends, the Movie is called IX.
Did you ever like to watch any of the Star Wars animated films.
No not really, I never got into the television series.
What about the video game?
Yeah the game was just like the movie and it made it a lot of fun to play.
