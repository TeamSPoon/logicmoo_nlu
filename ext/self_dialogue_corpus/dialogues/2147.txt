do you really think romo will stay retired?
heck no.
you know he's going to be calling n f l games for fox.
that's just gonna make him miss the action even more.
do you think he's got anything left in the tank?
yep. i think dallas will be sorry they let him go.
naw, that young bull is the truth.
you talking about prescott?
yeah.
naw. i think this season he takes a major step backwards.
maybe. but i knew he wouldn't beat the packers in that playoff game last season.
why you say that?
he was a rookie. his first playoff game?
and?
and you know he was nervous. that's why they were getting trashed at the half.
yeah but second half they got it together.
true that.
they had a chance to win the game in over time.
but it shouldn't have gone to over time.
shoot, same thing like the falcons in the dang super bowl.
