Did you get the DVD of Suicide Squad yet?
Yeah, I bought it last weekend.
And? What did you think?
It was a okay. I really didn't see what the hype was all about.
What? You didn't like it?
What was there to like?
Villains becoming heroes who have to save the day.
I guess sometimes it's good to be bad but..
That's what I meant. The bad guys had to save the day.
You didn't let me finish.  I guess sometimes it's good to be bad but in Suicide Squad's case, bad is just plain bad.
You just didn't like it, huh?
No. It gives villainy a bad name.
How about how the villains had to bail  the government out of a mess they created?
I did find that a little ironic.
Granted it was better than Bat Man vs Super Man.
Not by much.
The movie Suicide Squad  is something of a mess.
Well, I liked it. It wasn't the best and it could have been better but it was alright to me.
If it had a real plot that I could have followed, it might have been better to me.
I guess.
