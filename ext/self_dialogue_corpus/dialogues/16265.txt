One of my friends loves 21 Pilots, but I don't really like their stuff.
I love them too! How can you not like them?
I think they're over rated. Everyone is obsessed with them.
That's because they're awesome. Their songs are so unique.
I don't think they're that great. I saw them open for Fallout Boy once and they were okay.
You got to see 21 Pilots live?
Yeah, but I was there for Fallout Boy.
Fallout Boy isn't that great. It's something high schoolers would listen to.
Hey, I still like their music!
I know, I'm just saying.
What music do you like other than 21 Pilots?
I like a lot of smaller bands like the Strumbellas.
I hear them a lot on Pandora.
Do you like them?
Yeah, they're decent. I was looking into seeing them live sometime.
I'd love to go with you if they're ever in town.
Okay, as long as they're not opening for 21 Pilots.
I doubt they would be. Those two bands are really different.
I know, otherwise I wouldn't like the Strumbellas.
I'm glad we at least have one band we both like!
