What's your favorite Disney movie?
I love Mulan, she is such a strong lead female character.
My favorite Disney movie is Hercules.
Hercules has a great soundtrack - I love the song "Zero to Hero."
So does Mulan - "I'll Make a Man out of You" is amazing!
I agree, I love all the Disney songs.
Have you seen any of the recent Disney movies?
I saw Frozen when it came out but not since then.
I really want to see Moana.
Let's go to the movies!
