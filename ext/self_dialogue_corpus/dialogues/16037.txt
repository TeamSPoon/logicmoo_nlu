Have you ever listened to Kpop music?
Kpop - is that like that singer PSY who did Gangnam Style?
Yeah, I think PSY got a billion views on YouTube for that, some outrageously high number.
Do you have a favortie Kpop group?
Yes, I love this pop duo named TVXQ. They are legends in South Korea and most of Asia.
Why are they so popular?
Usually Kpop boy bands are made up of beautiful boys with very little talent. Mostly they serve as fantasy boyfriends for their fans.
What about TVXQ?
They did that, sure, but they were also one of the most talented group of singers ever put together by any of the South Korean entertainment companies.
Pretty faces and good voices too?
Plus Kpop boy bands dance while they sing, and TVXQ had great choreography. They really took South Korea by storm.
So I'm guessing they're still popular?
Not as much with the teenagers who are the Kpop demographic, but there are a lot of girls/women who have grown older with TVXQ and are solid fans.
What do you like about them?
I originally loved their sound - they were originally a 5 man group and their a cappella singing was extraordinary. Plus I loved to watch them dance.
What happened to the 5?
3 of them bailed from the group because they wanted more money. The two that are left are now the duo TVXQ, and they are in many ways better than the original 5.
Should I check them out?
Sure, they have a ton of YouTube music videos that you can sample. Watch "Mirotic" to see the 5 man group and "Keep Your Head Down" to see the duo.
I'll take a loot at them, thanks!
