What do you think of Beyonce?
She's a bad mom.
What do you mean?
Do you see the way she lets her daughter walk around with that hair?
You have to to be kidding me!
Actually, serious right now is what I am being.
How can you say such a thing? That woman dedicated a whole song to her daughter for crying out loud!
No, she didn't. With the way the media follows her every move, surely I would've heard about that.
Don't take my word for it. Google it then.
What am I supposed to be searching for on Google?
Just type in Beyonce Blue song,
Wait, you're not joking at all.
This is what I've been trying to tell you.
Well I figured because you're a member of the Bey hive, you're just trying to make her look good.
Being a loyal fan doesn't equate to me telling lies.
Ok well you've made your point then.
You're not going to at least listen to the song?
I will.
When?
I'll listen to it the next time I think ill of her as a parent.
