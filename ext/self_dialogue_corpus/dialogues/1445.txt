Past or present, who would be your dream NFL team be made of?
1993 Dallas running back Jerry Rice and Titans 1999 Eddie george to start.
WHo would you want for quarterback?
Joe Montana, from when he was with the 49ers.
Really? I would have picked Peyton Manning when he was with the colts.
I never really liked Peyton Manning.
Really? why?
I always thought as good as Tennessee was to him, he should have spent some time there after the colts drafted him.
I think he would do great as a head coach at UT.
Maybe so, but he always semed like a legacy that acted entitled and I never felt like his team was loyal to him.
But how can you ignore his skill and record?
I am not, I just think that to ask your team to protect you and lay your body on the line, the loyalty factor  would have went a long way.
Ok I am not following you, do you have an example?
Sure, look at the 1990's Dallas cowboys, Aikman and rice where they dynamic duo.
ok so you would pick Manning because he is more a one man show?
I guess so, yes.
Who who you want on your defense?
The entire 2017 Falcons line up.
who would be the offense?
The 1985 Bears
