Did you see Lebron was a first team selection for the 11th time?
Yeah, next year he will break the record with his 12th selection.
All I want to know is who voted Lebron the the 4th team.
I know, crazy right. I can't wait to see once they release the full details of voting.
I don't think Anthony Davis should have been first team, do you?
I think Curry should have switched places with him. I don't think they put enough on team success with regards to voting.
I was just excited Wall finally made a team.
After his first season or two in Washington people started using the word "bust"
When do they announce the winners?
June 26th, I wonder why they wait so long.
How does the media actually vote?
They use points awarded on a 5-3-1 basis.
How many points did Harden average?
I think it was around 29.1 - which would be a high for him.
The thing that is crazy to me is who voted for Blake Griffin?
Yeah, He only had one vote....but seriously?
The thing I hate about  media "voting" is there could be such a discrepancy.
Did you have a chance to see the final scores? Some of them make me shake my head.
Did Jimmy Butler make a team?
Yes, third with 102 points.
