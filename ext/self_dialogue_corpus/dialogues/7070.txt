Do you like the new Disney movies?
Like Frozen? Not really.  I  like some of the earlier stuff, like Mulan.
That was a great movie- girl power!
Yes, although the really early ones, like Snow White and Cinderella were about rescuing the princess!
They were old fashioned-but the music was great in Snow White
Although when I was a kid Bambi made me so sad.
It still makes me sad, and so does Dumbo.
You know what else I like? Pocahontas.
I love that one.  Colors of the Wind is a great song!
Also, Aladdin. The genie was so funny.
