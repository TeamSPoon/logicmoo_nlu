Is 2001 about space?
Yes, but there are tons of different subtexts
What is that?
AS subtext is another meaning. The stuff that happens is the surface story and what it means is the subtext.
Cool. Can you tell me some of the subtext from it?
Sure. There is an IBM reference that is not part of the surface story
How do you know that?
Cause they flash the letters on Bowman's head when he is in the pod.
Cool
There are tons of things like that in Kubrick movies.
Oh I did not know he directed that.
He did.
I loved The Shining
That might be the greatest horror movie ever
I agree.
Jack Nicholson was haunting in it
Yeah and the other actors did great too.
There is a lot of subtext in that movie as well
Like what? I didn't see any
There is a whole Native American subtext.
