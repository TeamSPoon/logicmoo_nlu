Did you see Baby Face?
When did it come out?
Around 1934, pre-code.
You mean the Hays Code?
Yeah, they didn't really enforce it until 1935.
Baby Face is worth seeing?
It's amazing.
How are pre-code films different?
They don't have all the censorship and restrictions that came in with the Hays Code. It affected all American films from 1935 until the late '60s.
So who's in it?
Barbara Stanwyck is probably the most famous name.
She's great!
It starts with her alcoholic abusive father prostituting her from his dive bar!
Wow! I'm guessing it's not a Disney movie!
They did all kinds of stuff like that then, dealt with subjects that were never explored the same way for 3 decades.
So what happens next?
She kills her father, runs away with the black maid and works her way to the top.
College?
Hardly. But she's in charge the whole way. There's a lost print they found about 10-15 years ago, makes the film even better.
I'm putting it on my list.
