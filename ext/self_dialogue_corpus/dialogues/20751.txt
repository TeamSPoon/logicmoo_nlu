Did you ever see that movie called Morgan?
Was it that science fiction film about an artificial human?
Yeah that actress Anya Taylor-Joy from the movie The Witch is in it.
She is a pretty talented actress. I did see that movie and a few others she has been in.
Yeah I like a lot of the ones I have seen her in. My favorites of hers are Split and The Witch.
How come Morgan isn't your favorite?
The movie was okay but I feel like Kate Mara's character was a little too obvious.
Really? I liked her character but it did feel like something was missing.
I do like Kate Mara a lot and have seen a lot of her movies.
Same here. I liked her in Shooter as well.
That is the movie with Mark Wahlberg right?
Yeah. It's a really good movie. Danny Glover, Elias Koteas, and Michael Pena are in it.
I think I did see that movie. It was a good action film.
I liked it. I also liked Mark Wahlberg's movie called Ted 2.
Oh I know that movie. It was hilarious.
Yeah I liked it a lot. It had some good jokes.
I was kind of bummed it didn't have Mila Kunis in it though like the first one.
Yeah she wasn't able to be in it for some reason.
I know it's a shame but I hope she does more movies.
Same. She is one of my favorite actresses.
