The beats are better. The lyrics are basically saying the same things over and over again.

It reaches a newer generation. You can't reach a certain generation with other genres of music.
Do you think that rap music influences the way that young people act?
To a certain degree it does. You are influenced by what you see and hear the most. And for some young people, all they do is listen to rap music.
Did the movie "Straight outta Compton" seem realistic?
That's a good question. Straight Outta Compton is real for the many people who live in gang infested neighbor hoods. It shined light on things other peoply may or may not have seen or known about. Like who would have thought that most of their lyrics came from reality.
