What kind of movie should we watch today?
Something funny.
Any preferences?
No. I like most comedies.
Me too. Let's just see what they have.
I bet they have all the Adam Sandler stuff.
I'm sure. He's popular.
Do you like him?
He's funny but kind of ridiculous.
Yes. His music is too.
I don't like that as much.
Neither do I but the movies are better.
What's your favorite?
Maybe Fifty First Dates.
I think mine is Blended.
Want to watch that one then?
Sure. Do they have it?
It looks like they do?
OK. It's free to watch too.
Sounds like a plan then.
