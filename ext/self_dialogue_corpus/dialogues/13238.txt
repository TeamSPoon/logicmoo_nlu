Who is your favorite actress from the Star Wars movies?
It's a tough choice between Padme and Rey
Who was a better fighter?
I think Rey was by far
Do you think she will get better at fighting in the newest movie?
Oh yeah, she's just starting to learn how to fight
She has a lot to learn from Luke Skywalker
Yeah, I wonder if he will die in this next movie
That will be so sad, he is getting old though
The movie is called the Last Jedi so it makes me wonder if he will die
