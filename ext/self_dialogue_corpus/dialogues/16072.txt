I've been listening to a lot of Panic! At The Disco lately, I really dig them.
I haven't heard too many of their songs, but what I have heard, I really like.
They have a super unique sound, I've never heard anything like them.
Me either.
Did you know they started out as a Blink 182 cover band?
No, I had no idea!
Yeah, its a bit ironic, because they are so much better than Blink 182.
I can totally agree with you on that.
Who have you been listening to lately?
I've been listening to a lot of old pop punk albums. I guess I'm on a nostalgia kick.
Oh yeah? Like who?
Alkaline Trio, The Artaris, and Digger, mostly.
Oh wow Digger, its been a long time since I've heard them!
Yeah, I found the album when I was moving and haven't stopped listening to it since.
I miss when pop punk used to be really good.
Me too. I remember when Alkaline Trio first came out, I was totally blown away.
Well, maybe with Trump as our new president, we'll see a resurgence of good punk rock music.
What makes you think that?
Well, that's what punk is about, right? Fighting the establishment, tearing down the government, and so on.
You do have a good point there. Hopefully, you're right!
