What was your favorite Star Wars character?
I really like Princess Leia.
What about her particularly interested you?
Well, she is as much of a Jedi as Luke, for starters.
Despite that potential, Leia stayed pretty traditional though.
Perhaps, but we do not know what happened before the new trilogy.
I agree, and the gold bikini changed everybody's lives to some extent!
True.     Leia was not only a sex-object, but a tremendous General and warrior!
What do you think was the bravest thing Leis did?
By far, her trip to save Han Solo has to be viewed as the highlight.
