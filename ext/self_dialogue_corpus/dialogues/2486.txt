Who's an exciting player to watch?
I'd have to say Odell Beckham.
What team is he on?
He's a young receiver for the Giants.
Oh, I saw him before.
He's so explosive and entertaining.
His one handed catch was amazing.
He was falling out of bounds.
It's such a luxury to have him on your team.
He can easily catch a ball and go eighty yards for the touchdown.
I wonder how good the Giants will do this year.
They just signed Brandon Marshall.
He has a so so year with the Jets last season.
Their quarterback wasn't very good.
He should be good for the Giants.
He'll take some pressure of Beckham.
They have a lot of talent.
They also have Sterling Shepard.
Eli Manning should do well this year.
Yeah, even if he is pretty old.
