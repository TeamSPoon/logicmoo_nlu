Who's playing right now?
Oh this is that new SOB X RBE, just got it.
Sound great, where are they from?
Vallejo, somewhere around there.
This is a different style, the way they are riding this beat.
Yeah, it's like they are ahead of it or something.
Rhyming on the up beat.
I was just going to say that.
Are they playing live any time soon?
Maybe some local shows, nothing we'd hear about down here.
Maybe we should go up there, then.
I wouldn't mind that. There's some cute girls in Vallejo.
And you know this. Good music, too.
I know right? Mac Mall, E40 and them...
Remember that E40 show we went to a few years ago?
Oh snap I almost forgot. That was bananas.
The crowd was too turned up.
I know, it was packed wall to wall.
Too bad the sound system was wack.
Oh yeah it was, wasn't it? We could barely hear anyone up there.
