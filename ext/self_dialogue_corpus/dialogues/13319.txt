What did you think of the opening credits for the Star Wars franchise?
I remember being confused at what I was looking at the first time.
Yeah it was a little confusing wasn't it?
I thought so but the music was incredible and hooked me right away.
Yes, that star wars theme music will last for many more years and is so iconic.
Do you think there is any music similar to it?
You know i've never thought about it but I don't think so, nothing quite gives the same feeling.
You're right the music just mesmerizes you and get's you excited.
The credit scroll speed was nice, do you think it was too fast?
No I think it was perfect.
