Have you heard that Anastasia is on Broadway?
Really?
Yeah, I want to go see it.
I bet it's fantastic.
Yeah I loved that movie as a kid!
Me too, I wanted to be the lost princess so bad!
Me too!
I didn't understand anything about the Russians when I was a kid though, that part made no sense.
I know, me too. I couldn't understand why the Czar hated her family!
Yeah, but it didn't even matter, all that mattered to me was the love story!
