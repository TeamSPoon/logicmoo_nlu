I just watched an interesting indie movie.
What was it?
It's called The Battery. Have you hear of it?
It sounds familiar.  When did it come out?
It came out around 2012.
What genre?
Horror. Basically.
What do you mean? What's the sub genre?
Well, it's more or less a zombie movie.
And you said it's an indie movie? A cheap zombie movie?
This is different that what you're picturing.
How so?
It's about these 2 guys that were on a baseball team when the outbreak happened. They end up traveling together trying to survive.
Tell me more.
It's played like more of a character study for these two guys I guess.
A lot of gore?
Not really. It's not really missed. Like it said, this one is different.
How indie are we talking? Does it look terrible?
It looks pretty great actually. Good cinematography. It was made for only $6,000!
I think you have me sold. I will check it out.
