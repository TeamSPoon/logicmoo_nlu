Do you ever listen to The Police much?
Is that the one with Sting as the lead sting as the lead singer?
yes it is!
Oh okay! I'm not sure I know much from them though.
I'm sure you've heard them on the radio.
What are some of their biggest songs?
Every breath you take.
Oh okay I know that.
Also I can't stand losing you.
Maybe I've heard that one.
They play on the radio a lot.
Is that the band that also does Roxanne?
Yes!
Oh okay! Yeah I love the police!
I've been listening to them a lot lately.
Yeah they sound really great.
I wish they still toured a lot.
Yeah they hardly ever do.
If they ever do we should go see them.
For sure!
