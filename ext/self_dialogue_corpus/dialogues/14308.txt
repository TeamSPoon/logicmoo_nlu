When is the draft?
Its June 22nd  at 7 EST.
Where is the draft again?
Brooklyn at the Barclays center.
Who do you think the Celtics will draft?
I know they WON'T draft Ball, they don't want that train wreck.
I can't believe the way Ball's dad is acting.
Oh I do, he's a spoiled child.
Does Markelle Fultz or Lonzo Ball have the edge on top of most draft boards?
Fultz by far, even if Ball is the better player- all the off the court issues are a MAJOR concern.
Do you think Curry would be a different player if he didn't stay in college?
I think he IS the player he is because he stayed, no he won't have the lifetime stats in the NBA but his NCAA experience has helped him so much.
Best big man of all time?
Its easy to say Shaq or Jabbar, but you also have to think of others like: Malone, or Ewing....can I pick 3.
Do you think Thomas has been playing with his hip strain for awhile now?
Yes, I do....I think his sisters death has effected him a lot but that shouldn't make him slower off the dribble like he has been the past few weeks.
Should the Celtics keep the #1 pick?
I'm torn, I think they could trade and get an established player but also I would love to see Fultz with this group of players.
Will Lebron beat Jordon's 30 point game streak?
I think so, especially now that he's playing with a chip on his shoulder due to the MVP voting.
