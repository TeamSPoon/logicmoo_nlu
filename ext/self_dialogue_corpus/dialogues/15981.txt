Did you ever hear that one song by Eminem, the way I am?
Yes I think so.
It is one of his best.
What makes it so great?
It sounds really great so it has a wide appeal.
Ok and what else.
The lyrics are so psychological and strong.
Oh that does sound interesting.
Yes he tells a great story.
He is a powerful wordsmith.
Yes the lyrics are even a bit funny.
Haha I like that a lot.
Yes he really is a genius.
Yes I agree.
This is one of his best songs, it sounds good, it has meaningful lyrics, it is great.
It sounds like a jam.
Yes it certainly is.
I look forward to listening to it.
It will really pump you up.
