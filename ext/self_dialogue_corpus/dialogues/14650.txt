Are you a fan of basketball?
Yeah, I am.
Oh, did you used to play?
Yeah when I was a kid.
Were you any good?
Yeah, I was. I used to play against older people.
Cool! Did you watch the NBA?
Yup, a lot.
Who was your favorite team?
The Detroit Pistons
Seriously? Didn't they suck back then?
No! They had a young Grant Hill who was awesome.
You mean the washed up guy with all those ankle problems on the Suns?
Yeah, but he was totally different back then.
How so?
They used to call him the next Michael Jordan.
No way...
Seriously. He was the next big thing. He was awesome at Duke too
Ugh, Duke...
Yeah, I hate them too.
