You don't strike me as the type that listens to rap music.
Really, I'm a metalhead.
Oh, so I guess there's no point in talking about it, then.
I do actually listen to rap more than you might think.
Really? What do you like.
Eminem was always been my favorite.
Not bad. He's not the only one you listen to, is he?
Of course not. I listen to a lot of Tupac, Biggie, NWA, and Bone Thugs.
Oh, so you like 90s rap?
In my opinion, that's the best era of rap.
