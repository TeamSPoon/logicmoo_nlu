Do you like listening to B-52's music.
Very much. They're fun to listen to.
Yeah and they have a nice presentation, right.
Its definitely peppy.
The way they perform their songs is that way too. Which do you like?
Probably Rock Lobster and Love Shack.
Those are the popular ones.
Know anything about them?
They're from Athens, Georgia, right? New wave meets surf music.
And the B-52s name comes from the bomber?
That might be just a rumour.
Cindy Wilson the vocalist has a great voice.
Yeah I love hearing her sing. Her voice is crisp.
And not piitchy like some singers.
Are they still performing?
Funplex came out in 2008, I remember that.
Me too. Anything more recent?
They've been  touring Australia and New Zealand with Simple Minds.
Very nice!  I like Simple Minds.
And they made a guest appearance on Portlandia.
