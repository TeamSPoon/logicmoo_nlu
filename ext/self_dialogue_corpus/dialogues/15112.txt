Did you ever see the Harold & Kumar movies?
Yes they are good movies.
What they go through for a hamburger.
I know it is really ridiculous.
They are funny.
I like when they are riding the cheetah.
When they finally get there how many of the burgers they order.
I know I couldn't eat that many.
They look really good though.
They sure do.
