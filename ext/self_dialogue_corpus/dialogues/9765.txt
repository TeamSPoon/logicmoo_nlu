When was the last time we got something from Kim?
Lil Kim? She just released a new mixtape.
No kidding? What's it called?
Lil Kim Season, but she also released Hardcore 2016.
Hardcore 2016? Does it sample her debut?
I mean, not really. It's kind of a tribute in name only.
Would you say they are worth checking out?
Honestly, no. The production on it is really rough.
But didn't she just hook up with Bad Boy again?
Yeah, but only on a short term basis, I think.
