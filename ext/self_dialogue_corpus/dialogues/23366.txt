I just watched a movie that took me way back to my childhood.
What movie is that?
I saw the 2017 'Power Rangers' movie.
I saw that too.
What did you think about it?
Well, I didn't think it was too special, but I was always a fan of 'Power Rangers' as a kid.
What didn't you like about it?
I thought that the pacing was a little off.
How so?
The build-up to the discovery only introduced half the main cast.  Then the final act was too short.
What about the middle?
Well that's the thing; I barely remember that part.  Wish more happened.
What did you think about the action sequences?
That, I did enjoy.  Though I wish there were more of it.
Yea, for a 'Power Rangers' movie, they did lack that.  Though I did like the fact that they focused more on the characters' issues.
I enjoyed that aspect too.  In the original show, they were called "Teenagers with Attitude," but none of them actually had attitude.
That is very true.
The effects were cool though.  I'd probably still watch a sequel if it came out.
You think they're going to make a sequel?
Oh yeah.  Most franchise movies have sequels these days, so expect it!
