I saw a movie called headshot.
was it good?
yeah, it was the story of this really evil dude that kidnaps kids and turns them into henchmen.
that's bad. so the kids are doing bad stuff?
they're adults when we see them. they call the bad guy father but he's really twisted
twisted how?
he tosses the kids in a well and makes them kill each other for water or food. the survivors form his gang.
that is twisted.yes. One guy named Aldi or some like that tries to leave the gang I guess, subtitles.
foriegn film?
yeah, I think it may have been made in Jakarta or it was a place in the movie.
