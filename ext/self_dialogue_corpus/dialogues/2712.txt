Can I be honest for a second?
Sure, honesty always appreciated.
I really don't know that much about the NFL.
What do you mean?
Like, I don't even know what it stands for.
Oh honey, well I can probably answer any questions you have, I love football.
Okay.....so what does it stand for?
National Football League.
How many teams are there in the NFL>
I think 32, but I don't wanna say for sure.
Wow, I thought there would be more!
Really, anymore and it would be too much!
I don't know, I just thought there was a lot more than that.
Well, there is college football and such which brings the count much higher.
Gotcha, and these teams just all play against each other every year?
Sort of, basically they are split into two areas and fight between the two brackets.
Gotcha, and whoever wins the first bracket and the second bracket face off.
Yes, which is the Superbowl!
Gotcha, makes sense.
Any other questions?
