What do you think about the Falcons this year?
It's a long season. But I think they'll get at least through the first round of the playoffs. How about you?
It's rough. Competition gets harder. But if Matt Ryan's healthy. I think they have a shot of getting back to the Super Bowl.
Yeah. He was on fire in the playoffs. No picks. What? Seven touchdowns?
Something like that. The problem may still be the D-line.
Yeah. Even with the off-season pick-ups.
No matter what, it'll be cool to play in the new stadium.
Mercedes-Benz?
Yup. I mean, that thing is going to be great. Retractable roof and all.
Yeah. I'm going to try to get to a home game, for sure.
What did you think about retiring Vick's jersey?
I'm okay with that.
Me, too. I feel like the haters who want to punish him forever. That's just not right.
Agreed. Plus, you know, he just electrified Atlanta. Outside the dog stuff, you know, he was good for football.
For sure, running QBs definitely make the game for exciting.
Yup. I cringe every time one takes off, because, you know, the risk of injury seems so high for these guys.
Yeah. But that's part of what makes it so exciting.
Then you've got folks like Roethlisberger who just sit in the pocket and take on all comers
He's a beast.
Funny. For sure, but I'll always judge him worse than I do Vick.
