I am so excited about the upcoming NFL season.
Are you rooting for the Patriots?
Yes I am.  I am a loyal fan.
I know you are.  You have been a fan for many many years.
It started when I moved to New England when I was 12.
Didn't you say that your dad is a fan too?
Yes he is.  Whenever possible, we attend the team's home games at Gillette Stadium every year.
Are you a season-ticket holder?
Yes I am.  My father is too.  He is 80 years old now.
I cannot afford to buy season tickets.
Well, the majority of my entertainment budget goes to the Patriots.
I can see that.  You always have their newest T-shirt and cap.
And much more...you should come to my house.
I will bet you have all kinds of souvenirs related to the Patriots.
Yes I do. I am inviting you to come over on September 7.  We can watch the game together on TV.
It is the Patriots against the Chiefs, right?
Yes it is.  I am so excited.
I'll bet.  You seem to look forward to the football season every year.
Yes. Superbowl  is a big holiday for our family.
You are so funny.  Yes, I would love to come to your house on September 7.
