Did you see Godzilla?
Which one? There's like 10.
The new one with Bryan Cranston
Oh, yeah. Saw that when it came out.
What did you think of it?
Well, I was a bit disappointed.
Whys that?
The main draw for me was Bryan Cranston since I love breaking bad. But he was barely in it.
Yeah, he didn't get much screen time at all.
Exactly. The only memorable scene was when he had to say bye to his wife.
Yeah, the scene from the trailer.
That's not the only reason I was disappointed.
Why else?
Godzilla was barely in it either!
Yes, that's why I didn't like it.
I was hoping for tons of scenes of him destroying cities and fighting monsters.
Same. Closest we got was when he was in the city after destroying the tea in or whatever.
Yeah, the backstory about him was cool though.
If they would have went into more detail about him, sure.
I guess. Overall, just disappointing
