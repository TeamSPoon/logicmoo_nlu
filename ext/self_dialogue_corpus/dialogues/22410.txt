Who is your favorite actress?
That's a tough one. I'm gonna go with Kathy Bates.
Kathy Bates?!
Yeah, she's really talented.
I guess.
Did you ever see Misery?
The Stephen King one?
Yeah.
That was pretty good.
She's got a knack for crazy.
You can say that again!
James Kaun was really good in that one.
He's good in everything he does.
Did you see Elf.
Just a dozen times or so.
Ha! My favorite Christmas movie ever!
Will Ferrell is so funny!
He is. He really needs to do some more movies.
I heard they were doing a sequal to The Other Guys.
That would be awesome!
