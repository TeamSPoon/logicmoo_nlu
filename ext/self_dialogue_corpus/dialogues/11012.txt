Have you been keeping up with the Dallas Stars?
Not really...things were looking good for them but their season fell apart, right?
Oh, yeah, it was a rough season, but the good ole days maybe back!
What do you mean?
They have hired Ken Hitchcock back as manager.
Oh, wow, wasn't he the coach when they won the Stanley Cup?
Yep, the days of us Texans learning hockey and having another team that could win a championship!
Oh, yeah! I loved when they moved into town and brought Modano with them.
He was so great to watch!
And a good guy at that!
Do you remember the time he was injured and had to be carted off the ice?
Hmmm, that doesn't ring a bell.
Look for it on YouTube...you'll never believe what happened to him!
I have no idea what you are taking about...how did he get hurt?
No, no...it's what happened next...they dropped him!
What do you mean they dropped him?
As they brought him out on the stretcher, they dropped him onto the pavement!
Oh, wow, you can't let that happen to the guy that you built your franchise around.
Yeah, of course I wish we had a new Star to build the future upon!
Well, we have Hitchcock back; maybe Modano can come back from retirement...and avoid the stretcher!
