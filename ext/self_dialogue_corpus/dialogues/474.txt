Are you ready for the NFL season to start?
Yes, I'm interested to see what happens.
What team do you want to watch the most?
I want to watch the Rams
Are you a big Rams fan?
No, I want to watch them lose.
Why do you want to watch them lose?
The ownership is a pathetic excuse for existence.
Why do you think that?
They left a city in LA for St. Louis, signed a deal that would allow them to leave, and then fleeced St. Louis for the stadium costs.
Well, wasn't that a business decision"
Yes, it was and it left the city of St. Louis with the cost of a stadium.
True, but now LA has their team back.
Yes, and they are terrible.
Well, they could get better.
I don't think they can, the ownership and management is pathetic.
Why do you say that?
They don't know anything about football, they just bleed their cities for money.
That is too bad.
It is terrible, I don't dislike the players, but that ownership should lose a bunch of money of the team continues to perform poorly.
