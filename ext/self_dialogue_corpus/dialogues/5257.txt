Hey I brought back your copy of The Lion King.
Did you like it?
Yes! You didn't tell me how sad it was.
Oh yea the Mufassa scene. I didn't want to spoil it.
Well I appreciate you. It spoiling it. Timon and Pumba were rediculous.
Yea they remind me of your brothers.
Yea me too! Especially with how gross they are. The songs were incredible.
Well it's Disney of course they were.
How many times have you seen it?
Probably a dozen times since it first came out.
