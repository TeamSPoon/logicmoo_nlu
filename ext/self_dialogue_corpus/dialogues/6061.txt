Did you notice that TV never plays any of the really good Disney movies?
Yeah! I haven't seen Mulan 2 for years, not to mention The Lion King.
mostly they play the old movies, like Snow White and Sleeping Beauty.
Ugh, Sleeping Beauty is terrible.
Why so? I like it.
She doesn't actually do anything! All she really does is sing and dance.
Hmm, I guess you're right. But you've gotta admit, Prince Phillip was pretty cool.
Yeah, he was really heroic  and the epitome of a knight in shining armor.
The villain, Maleficent, was also very realistic.
Yes, the battle between her and Prince Phillip was extremely memorable.
