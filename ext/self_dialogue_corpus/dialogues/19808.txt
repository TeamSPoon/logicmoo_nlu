Is Seargant Peppers the best album of all time?
I dont know if I would consider that.
It just expands the entire Beatles universe.
I agree that it really is influential.
I would consider it the best of all time.
I think its tough to do so
Why would you not think it is?
Music is so subjective that you have to break it down by genre in my opinion.
I can see your point but this album resonated with a ton of people.
Did not resonate with me like others I guess.
So whats your best album of all time.
Honestly? I do not have one.
So theres nothing you think is better than others.
I have my personal favorites but I wouldnt say one is best of all time.
So then what do you think is your favorite album of all time?
The one that has most meaning? I would say Metallica's self titled
Wow that is out of left field
Not really when you consider their impact
They made it alot easier for heavy metal
I think rock fans in general
