What was the first Star Wars movie you saw in theaters?
I saw The Phantom Menace when it came out.
Really? What was your favorite character?
I really liked Darth Maul, I thought his lightsabre was cool.
Do you think we'll ever see another double-bladed lightsabre?
I hope not, it's cooler if he was the only one to ever have one.
I wish he hadn't died though.
Yeah, too bad he couldn't have been the main villain for that series.
I wonder if there's a book about him or anything.
Maybe! We'll have to check.
