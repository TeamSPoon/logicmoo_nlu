Have you seen the trailer for that movie American Assasin?
No, what's that about?
It seems to about this incredible special agent that they are training to infiltrate terrorist cells and take people out.
What's the twist?
think it's that the guy that trained him ends up being the guy he has to kill.
Oh cool, who's in it?
I don't know the name of the main guy. But Micheal Keaton plays the guy that trained him.
Micheal Keaton from Batman?
Yea, well the first batman.
Man, I miss that guy, that Batman movie was so good.
Yea, he was in Beetlejuice also.
Oh yea, Beetlejuice was so unique.
Yea it was a crazy movie.
He was also in that movie Multiplicity.
Was that the one where he had multiple personalities?
Not exactly. He made clones of himself.
Oh yea, and each clone had a different part of his personality.
Right. That was pretty good too.
He's just an all around amazing actor.
Agreed.
