I don't care I'm an adult, I love Disney movies
Really? I don't think I've seen any in years.
Yeah but what about when you were a kid?
Oh, I used to watch them all the time then!
What was your favourite?
Oh I don't know that I could pick one. What was yours?
I love the old ones like Robin Hood and The Sword in the Stone.
Robin Hood's the one with the fox everyone on Buzzfeed thinks is sexy, right?
Ha! Yes that's right.
I don't think I've seen The Sword in the Stone.
Oh it's brilliant.
Is it about King Arthur?
Yes, but when he was young, before he became king.
That doesn't sound interesting.
Well it's got Merlin who finds him and knows who he will be so he decides to teach him what he'll need to know.
Let me guess, it all goes wrong?
Exactly! And he's got an owl.
Who, Arthur?
No, Merlin. He's called Archimedes.
Well that sounds like a dumb name for an owl.
