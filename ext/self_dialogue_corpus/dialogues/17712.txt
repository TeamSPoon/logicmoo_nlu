Have you heard of the group called Alaskan String Band?
No, what kind of music do they play?
They play Christian music in a folk style and other Americana pieces.
Where did you hear about them?
They did a performance at The Spencer Theater in Alto, New Mexico that I attended with my daughter.
Are they any good?
I think they are fantastic! It is actually a single family who makes up the group.
How big is the group?
It's a Mother, Father, two girls and a boy.
Do they all play string instruments?
Yes but they also sing. Their family name is Zahasky and of course they are from Alaska.
I would like to hear some of their music. Where can I go to listen to it?
They have several YouTube videos. My favorite is their rendition of the song Farther On.
I've never heard of that song before. I'll have to check it out.
That's a good idea. I just love to listen to new groups on YouTube.
You said there were two sisters and a brother right?
Yes and the brother is actually my favorite musician in the band. His name is Quinn and he plays the upright bass.
Why is he your favorite?
He has a very unique style of playing the bass. I just like his style both musically and as a person.
Maybe they will come back to New Mexico sometime and we can go to a concert together.
