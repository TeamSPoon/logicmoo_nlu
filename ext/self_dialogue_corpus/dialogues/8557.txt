Have you noticed the change in Katy Perry lately.
She and her songs have gotten a bit dark as of late.
A long was from the cheeky pop she used to sing.
Yes, I loved her song Teenage Dream.
That was a real summer song.
I enjoy her shows too, she puts on a good act.
Her music videos used to be so bright.
I loved her I kissed a Girl song.
That was kind of ground breaking for her.
I think it was the song that really put her on the map.
