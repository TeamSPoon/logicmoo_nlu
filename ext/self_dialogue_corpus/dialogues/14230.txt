What do you think of Lady Gaga's music?
I hear her music in the clubs all the time. It's very danceable.
You can really move to it. But she also has a few ballads. They're quite beautiful.
She has an amazing voice.
Her personality is something else, too!
Did you see the meat dress she wore to the Grammy's a few years ago?
Disgusting! But it was just a political statement. She's not the airhead people make her out to be.
Quite the contrary. I watched Howard Sterm interview her, and she came off as very intelligent and well-spoken.
I saw that interview too! It was strange to see her without her "costume."
She looks pretty ordinary, doesn't she? But man, that voice.
