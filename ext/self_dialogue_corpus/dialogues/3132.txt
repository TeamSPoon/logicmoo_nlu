Hey..countdown for the NFL 2017 begins are u excited?
Yep...waiting to see what is in store for this year
I see there are lot of new and exciting players?
Yes each team has done their homework
I see there are lot of senior players are waiting to prove the point
Yes also dont forget Big ben or Tom Brady
I believe this will be Big Ben's year dont you think?
I also believe he deserves one more ring
It was a close season last time but i believe this year can be his..
Speaking about this makes me eager to wait for the kick off game
Do you think the pre-season games have any help to the teams?
I dont think so...it is kind of becoming a waste
I generall dont watch the preseason games...not that exciting
Me too...but hopefully this year will be different
Hopefully we will get to see different teams in the playoffs
Yep i want to see the change..want to see more youngsters
Based on the predictions young guns are going to rock this season
I am also waiting to see that
Lets set up a kick off party at our place
thats a good way to begin the season...
