What's up man?  You ready to watch the nfl?
Sure am!  Too bad you don't have any team to root for now.
Yeah I know, the Chargers left San Diego this year.  They're they LA Chargers now...
I know right.  It must kinda suck for you since you were a big fan.
Yeah, I don't know if I'll root for them. I'll probably watch a few games.
Well it's basically the same team.  Rivers, Gates and crew.
Your'e right, but it still hurts because I really invested a lot of my time and money as a fan.
Well maybe let's change the topic, who do you think will win it this year?
I don't know, I think the Patriots have a good shot this year.
Really?  I thought you hated them.
I kinda do, but I can't pretend they aren't really good.  Brady looks like he isn't slowing down at all.
I guess.  I think the Packers are gonna win it all.
Really?  They've been one and done for how many years now?
Sure, but I think they're due this year.  Aaron Rodgers has been playing great lately.
Yeah, he's totally been really solid.  Who knows.  The Cowboys are looking strong this year too.
Definitely, although too bad about the Romo situation, I really like the guy but he keeps getting hurt.
Yeah, feel bad for the dude but his time is up now.  Time for a new leader for the team.
Hopefully some new team emerges this season.  Pats going all the way again will be kinda of boring.
Really?  I think seeing a dynasty take over everyone is good for everbody.  It creates someone to really root against
