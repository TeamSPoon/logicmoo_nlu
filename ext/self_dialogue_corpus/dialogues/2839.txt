Do you think Derek Carr was worth all the money the Raiders gave him?
I think they overpaid.
Carr seems to be headed to be a top quarterback in the league.
He is okay.  I don't know if he is really elite yet.
The Raiders are clearly better with him running the show.
They have made lots of changes, but yes, he has been okay back there.
I just don't know if I am sold on him.
It just seems like more hype than proof at this point.
With the big deal, he is going to have high expectations.
If they don't advance deep into the playoffs, people will start turning on him.
Carr has lots of more options to help him out now.
It just adds more expectation.  If he doesn't deliver a superbowl win, the fans are going to turn on him.
Even if they don't win a superbowl, the level of play of the raiders is much better than the past.
Carr is getting the tools and now he is going to have to make something happen.
His stats should get better with all the new additions on offense.
The raiders look good on paper, but you never know when they get on the field.
Carr staying healthy is going to be in everybody's mind.
He is not going to have much room for let downs after getting the big contract.
Yeah, people are going to be looking at him as an elite qb now.
Even if he falls off, he will still have the fat paycheck.
