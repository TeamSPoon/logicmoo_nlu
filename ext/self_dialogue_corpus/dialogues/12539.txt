Do you like the Star Wars movies?
Yes. What is your favorite one?
I think Rogue One was my favorite.
That one was good. I liked The Force Awakens.
I saw the first one in the movie theater when I was in the movie theater.
I did too. I'm pretty sure it was the first movie I ever went to at the theater.
I like the old ones and I like the new ones but I didn't really like the three in the middle.
Really? The ones with Annakin Skywalker?
I knew that he was inevitably going to become Darth Vader, and that bothered me.
Really? I thought it was interesting to see what his origins were.
