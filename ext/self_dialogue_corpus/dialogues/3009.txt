I see you're wearing an Arizona Cardinals shirt.  You ready for the season?
I cannot wait!
You think it's going to be Fitzgerald's last year?
I don't know. He seems to be super-human he may last forever. What do you think?
Nobody's super-human. He's getting up there in age.  This may be it for him.
If so, he will be missed. He's so fun to watch.
I know. right?  How great was that Superbowl game?
Such a heartbreaking ending.  We should have won it.
Maybe this will be their year?
That would be awesome, but there are some great teams.  I guess we'll wait and see.
Yeah I hope our defense can step it up.
Nobody's better that Patrick Peterson.
It's awesome to watch him guarding a receiver.  He's on them like glue!
I know!  The QB sometimes just ignores that receiver and throws to someone else.
That makes it tough for the offence to pretty much lose a player for the game.
Yep!  I just hope nobody gets hurt!
That seems to be how the Cardinals roll.
It is.  I tell you we could have won it all 2 years ago if we didn't have all of our defense on injured reserve.
I agree.  Here's hoping we don't have that problem this year.
Fingers crossed!
