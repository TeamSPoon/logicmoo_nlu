Do you have any favorite rock albums?
I actually just found a new favorite very recently.
Oh really? Which one?
It's the self-titled album by Avenged Sevenfold.
I don't think I've heard of them.
Well, they're a hard rock/heavy metal type of band based out of Southern California.
So they play both styles?
Kind of. Their self-titled album is a great mix of both, and that's why I like it.
Okay, now I understand.
You should definitely give them a listen.
