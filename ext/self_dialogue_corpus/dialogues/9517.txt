Who is the biggest fake rap artist of all time?
Are you serious? The Van Winkle fellow Mr. Vanilla Ice.
He's one heck of a contractor and carpenter though.
You are right about that. I'm sure the dude always knew that he was going to need a plan B.
Why did he tell everyone that he was from Miami? Did he think he was being cool?
I don't know. The dude's from Lewisville, Tx........and no knock on Lewisville but there are lots of guys there that are just like him.
He should have just rapped about Dallas. Dallas is a really cool town.
That's what I'm saying, but I guess he thought Miami was a cooler look or something.
Was Ice Ice Baby his only hit?
Most definitely, and I guarantee you he has performed that song like at least 20,000 times.
