Do all of the Disney classic movies have singing in them?
I don't think they do. There are live action ones that don't.
But the animated ones?
Most do for sure, but I don't know about all of them. There are a few I haven't seen.
Which ones?
I never saw the Black Cauldron and it has been years since I've seen Sword in the Stone.
Those certainly aren't the more popular ones.
No, definitely not.
I really like the ones from the early 90s and late 80s.
Well that's when we got Beauty and the Beast, the Little Mermaid, and Lion King so I can see why!
