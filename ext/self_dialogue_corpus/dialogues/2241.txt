Is Tom Brady the best ever?
He might be the best QB ever
What about the best player?
It might not be him. There are too many variables
I think maybe Joe Montana has had a better career
He is one of the best for sure
Is he better than Brady though?
I think so
That is hard to say though
Right because they are different eras
Tom Brady is the best QB of this era
I agree with that
But, Peyton Manning is pretty good too
I forgot about him
He is a great player
I think he did not play that great in his last game though
Yeah, the defense won that title
Agreed
I wonder if he will come out of retirement
No chance
