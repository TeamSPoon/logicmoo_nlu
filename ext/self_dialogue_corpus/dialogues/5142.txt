What happened to Greg Bird?
What do you mean?
He was killing the ball but now he stinks.
He's had 60 at-bats. Relax.
I know it's early but he looks completely lost.
Compared to what? Like I said he's only had sixty ab's.
In spring training he was smoking the ball though, now it's not even the same swing.
Well spring training stats are worthless, everybody is just trying to shake the rust off and get going. Plus Bird got hurt.
Is it normal to struggle like this coming off an injury though, especially when it seemed like he had gotten it back?
Well you gotta remember he's young and didn't even really have a lot of minor league experience.
When he first came up to the majors he was hitting awesome.
Right, and then pitchers get to see you often and after a while they can figure you out. It's normal.
So you think it's just growing pains and adjusting?
To a degree, yes, and the injury complicates things. All in all he's still very green and will need time to mature.
I just want to see him mash again in that short porch.
Well the Yankees are generally young and going through it all. You have some guys really overperforming and then you have guys like bird trying to catch up.
You're right, I guess I should wait it out.
Count your blessings with Judge and those guys really turning it on, they're keeping the torch lit.
Got that right. I just bought some of his rookie cards.
Nice. Hope he keeps it up.
