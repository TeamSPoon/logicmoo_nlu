What's your favorite Jay-Z Album?
Probably Reasonable Doubt. You?
Yes, Reasonable Doubt. Any others, and do you think he's declined over the years?
Probably The Blueprint. And I can say that his old music is better than the new stuff.
Definitely. But I can understand that he's a family man now.
Yep, but still gotta feed the family through those quality rhymes.
I'm wondering how 4:44 will sound like.
Yeah, those ads have been everywhere...
I'm just really waiting to see how the production turns out.
Right, hopefully it won't be like the Blueprint 3.
You didn't like the production on BP3?
I loved it, just didn't love the lyrical content...
Okay, I see. Yes, you're right with that.
Yeah, BP3 was weak. Listen to it, then listen to Reasonable Doubt and you'll see...
Okay, I see your point. Think we'll get a feature from the twins?
Maybe, I hope so.
I know they're rolling in dough already.
Both parents millionaires and billionaires!
Yes, that's unbelievable
Funny how rap can really have you stacking money like that!
