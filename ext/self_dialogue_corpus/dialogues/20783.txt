have you seen that movie fist fight ?
no but i heard about it. doesn't it have ice cube in it?
ya thats the one. oh man that movie is so funny.
ya ice cube turned out to be a pretty good comedy actor.
i laughed so much. its about two teachers, who get off on the wrong foot with each other.
is ice cube one of the teachers?
ya he plays a really tough teacher. who it turns out is misunderstood and he really has a big heart.
i really like characters like that, you know you don't like them at first but then the story changes and you wind up really liking that character.
i know thats great acting. they can take you from one view point to the completely opposite end.
does the movie have any action in it ?
oh ya, there's a cool fight scenes.
who fights ?
the two teachers, that's why they named it fist fight.
oh i thought it was about two kids fighting.
no its the teachers.
wow that does sound funny.
ya ice cube tells the other teacher that they are meeting after school, you know like kids do.
i know that actually happened to me.
so all day long it just gets worse and the tension builds. i dont want to spoil it for you, but that's a really funny movie.
i'll check it out. it sound funny.. i think i will enjoy it.
