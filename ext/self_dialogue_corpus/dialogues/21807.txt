What is your favorite holiday movie?
The Christmas Story is so classic.
I remember that movies.
It was 1983! They did such a great job making it a timeless classic.
You know I think the kid Ralphie is now a director.
Peter Billingsley
Yeah that's him.
That lamp still kills me. Every year they bring back ornaments that look like that lamp.
I know. Crazy. That move is so authentically 1940's.
It is. Another one of those great coming of age movies.
I know. So many parts of it feel so familiar.
It's hard to image a holiday without seeing that movie.
It seems like it's a tradition. I can't think of any other holiday movie like that. Unless you talk animation.
Yeah, that's not the same thing.
Oh I thought of one....The Ref...totally different that's a good one.
I live The Ref. I think that's when I started liking Dennis Leary.
I've always like Kevin Spacey.
That movie is so funny.
Remember the scene with wreaths on their head...flaming candles....
There is always some family member that wants to try to start a new tradition...and failing. Seriously, fire hazzard.
