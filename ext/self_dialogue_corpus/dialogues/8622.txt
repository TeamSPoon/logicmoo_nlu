Aerosmith has to be one of the best rock bands of all times.
Yes, they are up there at least in the top five.
One of my favorites is Janie's Got A Gun.
What album is that from?
That was on the album Pump.
That one had a lot of good songs.
Love in an Elevator was on that too.
I loved that song.
So don't you think they are the best rock band.
Still have to say top five.
