Well, another lunch and talking about movies.  I rented the movie you recommended last time.
Brooklyn?
Yes.
Well--
It was wonderful and the lovely lead actress is Saoirse Una Ronan who was born in The Bronx.
You can put your notecard away now.
I was so impressed that I had to look her up.
Has she been in anything else?
She's had a career for at least ten years, but I didn't recognize any of the parts.
It's always interesting how so many of the so-called overnight stars have been working for years.
You're right, although I don't think she has become a star.
No, probably not; it was a great role but not that many people see simple stories.
Although it did have a box office of around 60 million while costing 11 million or so.
Back to the notecard again, huh. Well, if she were a star, she would cost 11 million herself.
You know the movie reminded me of the movie, Marty--which won an academy award for best picture and for Ernest Borgnine.
Geez, how old are you? I can't even remember Ernest Borgnine from McHale's Navy
I didn't say I saw its first run--I watch TCM sometimes.
I've seen it, too.  I can't say that I thought it was that great.
No, but a simple heartwarming story, like Brooklyn.
I don't think a movie like Brooklyn could ever win the academy award these days, but who knows.
