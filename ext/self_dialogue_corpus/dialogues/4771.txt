Wow, there are a few surprises going on in baseball this year.
Yes, I am surprised how poorly the Cubs are doing.
How about those Milwaukee Brewers.
Yes, as of today, they are actually leading their division.
I am not sure they will continue doing so well.
They seem to have the hitting but, pictching is not fantastic.
I think they have won 5 games in a row now.
Yes, I noticed they were actually a couple of games ahead of the Cubs.
Houston is another team that is surprising.
I noticed they have the best record in baseball.
I know they have a pretty good pitching staff.
There hitting is also very good.
Those in the know say they will last.
Would not surprise me.
I noticed the Dodgers are doing as well as everyone had predicted.
Yeah, I think they are only a couple of games above 500.
Who do you think is the best team in the American league?
For me it is a toss up between the Astros and the Yankees.
I am not crazy about the rule changed that just allows you to walk a batter intentionally just by letting the umpire know.
I don't like it either. Takes away from some of the excitement of throwing 4 balls without throwing a passed ball.
