What you doing?
I'm listening to some Beyonce.
Which one?
The one with her and Sean Paul.
You mean Baby Boy?
Yeah that's the one.
That's my jam.
I'm actually playing the whole cd.
I know right. The whole cd is fire.
I like Baby Boy and I like Naughty Girl.
I turn up every time I hear Naughty Girl. That song is crunk.
I like some of her new stuff but her first album is the best.
I like the songs she did with Destiny's Child.
Cater to You? That's my song.
Did you see them a few years ago when they performed at the BET awards?
You mean when Magic Johnson and them were sitting on the stage?
Yeah. I got that thing on my dvr.
I think Terrence Howard didn't know how to act behind that.
I know right. And Magic too.
Who was the third guy they had on stage? I can't seem to remember.
