Hey so have y'all seen the Despicable Me and Minions series yet?
Oh yeah, of course!  I love that series!
Me too!  I'm waiting on them to make another one now.
Yeah, when I first saw the trailers I thought it looked silly but I'm so glad I gave it a chance.  I loved it!
I know, I thought the same thing!  I only watched it because my kids wanted to.
Me too!  That's funny.
Yeah but then I wound up totally enjoying it.  The first and second ones were especially hilarious to me.
Yeah, I thought so too.  I liked Minions but it wasn't quite as good as the rest.
Yeah, but even so.  I'm glad they kept making them.
Have you heard anything about a new one coming out?
No, nothing yet.  It seems like they were such a hit that they'd want to continue with the series.
Yeah, but maybe they're getting burnt out on plot ideas.
I don't know, they could go on and on with the kids and things they grow up to do.
Yeah, that's true.  There's a lot of opportunity there.
Well I guess we'll find out in the next few years, won't we?
Yes, that is true!  Have you seen anything else good recently?
What, animation movies or just movies in general?
Just in general I guess.
Well, Finding Dory was pretty good.
Oh I haven't seen that yet!
