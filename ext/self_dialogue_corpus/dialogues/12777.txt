So here is a question about Star Wars, why is it not more disturbing that Leia and Luke pretty much got it on?
I guess in the future incest is not frowned upon
Yeah I guess considering people are even sleeping with Aliens
Yup, like Jabba the Hut
No way that Alien is doing anything with Women.
I don't know why else would he have dressed Leia up in that skimpy little bikini looking thing
True, I guess I didn't look at it like that
Still the Visual is pretty freaking gross
Yes it is, now I need to go look at some pretty lady's to get that out of my head
Too true i'm right behind you.
