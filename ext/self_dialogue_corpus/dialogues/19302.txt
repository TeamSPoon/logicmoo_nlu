Have you heard of the latest Ed Sheran album?
No i haven't.
well am sure you heard one of the songs.
Especially shape of you.
I think everyone heard that song.
Its such a hit.
Ed Sheran is really good.
He hasnt even been that long in the game but he is doing great.
Well people already made remix of it.
Have you heard the gospel version of it?
Yea its pretty cool.
The lady has an amazing voice.
Well people do like pop.
speaking of pop, i would still say no one beats Michael Jackson.
That guy is a legend.
His songs are like nothing else and they were sung time ago.
He was Chris Brown's mentor.
Well no wonder Chris was doing so well before all those scandles.
Well his new album loyalty is really good.
If he kept up with the good work, he would be bigger than he is right now.
