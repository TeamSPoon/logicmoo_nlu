What types of comedies do you like?
I like "smart" comedies, like Woody Allen movies.
I like Woody Allen movies, too, especially his earlier comedies, like Bananas.
His earlier comedies were sillier, but not my favorites.
His more recent comedies, like Magic in the Moonlight, are more mature.
Yes, I like those better.
Annie Hall is a classic. I like when Woody himself is in the movie.
It sure is, one of my favorites. I also like Manhattan and I like Woody's character in that.
I like that he plays neurotic characters. I like his choice of actresses, too, like Diane Keaton and Mia Farrow.
Yes, they're great performers. So real and genuine.
