Have you seen Ratatouille?
Is that the one with the rat who wants to be a Chef?
Yes, it takes place in Paris.
I vaguely remember it. What I do remember is a lot of cooking.
His lifelong dream was to cook in Gusteau's kitchen.
What was his name again?
Remy.
Isn't Linguini, Gusteau's son?
Skinner had the papers that proved it in his office.
That's where Remy found them.
