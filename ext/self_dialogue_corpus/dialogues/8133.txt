Are you into Ed Sheeran?
I loved his music from his first two albums.
Have you heard anything from his last album?
I knew it just came out, but I don't know anything on it.
It's pretty good.
What's the name of the album?
I think it's called Shape of You.  That was one of the first singles.
Is it any good.
Yeah, it's pretty great.
I'll need to borrow it sometime.
