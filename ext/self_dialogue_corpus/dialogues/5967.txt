Did you like 'The Incredibles?'
Yes, very much so.
I think one could argue that it was one of the best superhero movies of that year.
I think one could even argue that it was a better 'Fantastic Four' movie than 'Fantastic Four.'
It's really funny that you say that, because there are very similar parallels between the two.
Did you have a favorite character?
I really liked Dash.  How about you?
Elastigirl was my favorite character.  Did you know that Holly Hunter voiced her?
I did not know that.  Any other actor I would know from that cast?
Sure.  Samuel L. Jackson did the voice of Lucius Best.
