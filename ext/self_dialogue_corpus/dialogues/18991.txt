Have you heard of Maren Morris?
I don't think so. Who is she?
She is a new country singer. She is somewhat similar to Miranda Lambert and Kacey Musgraves.
Oh, I like both of them a lot. What are some of her big songs?
I personally like My Church and 80s Mercedes.
I think I know who she is. Did she do a duet with Dierks Bentley?
Yep! They both did I'll Be the Moon on Dierks Bentley's latest album.
I love Dierks Bentley. What are your favorite Dierks Bentley songs?
I like Drunk on a Plane and Free and Easy.
Me too! Feel That Fire is Good As Well.
Who else do you enjoy listening to?
I like some of Blake Shelton's older music as well as Keith Urban.
Keith Urban and Carrie Underwood have a new duet out. What do you think of it?
I really like it. It is a different sound for both of them, but it works.
Keith Urban is such a great guitarist.
He really is. I think he and Brad Paisley are two of the best guitarists in country music right now.
Yeah I agree. Vince Gill is also great.
Has Vince Gill come out with any new music lately?
I don't think he has, unfortunately.
That's too bad. I really like his music.
