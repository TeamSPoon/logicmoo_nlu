Did you have a favorite Disney movie growing up?
Hmm, I had a lot of favorites. What was yours?
Mine was Lion King.
Lion King is a classic. I don't know if it's my favorite though.
Well, what is your favorite then?
I liked Mulan and The Little Mermaid.
Yeah, Mulan is one of the best.
My new favorite is Princess and the Frog.
I like that one too!
I'll never get enough of these movies.
