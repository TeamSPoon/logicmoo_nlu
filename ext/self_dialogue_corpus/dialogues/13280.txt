People say Star Wars was all made up as it went, and it kind of was, but a lot of things were actually planned way ahead of time.
Like what? Darth Vader was always Luke's father?
No, that definitely only came about during the writing of Empire Strikes Back.
But you do have some examples, otherwise you wouldn't bring it up.
Of course. For example, during the making of the first film, George Lucas had the idea that the stormtroopers were all clones.
But they aren't though. I guess not until the prequels anyway.
Well, at the time, in '70s, it was just impractical to do that. But by the 2000s technology advanced, and he had a bigger budget, so his idea of a clone army came to fruition.
Kind of funny then, considering that in canon the clones were replaced by recruits eventually.
Another thing, Anakin getting fried on a volcano planet and becoming Darth Vader was something that dates back to around Empire or Jedi, too.
I'm sure a lot of it was still made up way later, but I see what you're saying. Some of the ideas that were used are pretty old.
