It's almost time for football to start training camps again.
Yeah, I know.  I have been looking forward to this season.
Me too, last year was good, but I expect even better results this year.
Now that the Cowboy's new quarterback, Dak Prescott, has a year of experience, he should be even better.
You would think so, but do you think he can top last year's performance?
It will be tough, that's for sure.
That's what I was thinking.
It depends on how that offensive line will do this year.
They keep getting better and better every year.
Right, so maybe this year will be the year the whole team actually makes it past the 1st playoff game.
I hope so.
It's just frustrating to have a good season, then not be able to win a playoff game.
Maybe it has to do with the coach.
Teams do prepare differently when it is a playoff game.
And maybe Jason Garrett just doesn't know how to prepare the team when it comes to the playoffs.
That's very possible.
They have only won one playoff game since he has been the head coach.
I know, believe me, I know!
Well, lets just hope this is the year to take it all the way!
I am so excited, I can't wait for them to start playing games!
