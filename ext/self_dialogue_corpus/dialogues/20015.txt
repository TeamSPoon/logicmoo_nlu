What kinds of music do you like?
I really listen to just about everything.
Me too I would say I am ecclectic.
I really like pop music when I am in an upbeat mood.
I usually listen to it in the summer.
Me too that's weird how you link certain music with time.
I just got back from the mountains and listened to country.
That would seem righ also folk.
Yes I listened to folk as well as bluegrass.
I think that if you went to New Orleans you'd listen to Jazz.
Yes and I would listen to blues too.
That's what I mean how different music is for certain times.
I also listen to sad songs when I'm doen.
I do that too but try not to be sad.
That's when you listen to pop.
Pop makes me want to clean.
It makes me want to be out and driving.
Or you could be clubbing.
Yes I could club
Now you're talking.
