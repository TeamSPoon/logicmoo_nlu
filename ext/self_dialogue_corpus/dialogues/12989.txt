What is the best Star Wars movie
I think it is Episode 1
why so
I love Episode 1 because it was the 1st star wars to come out in 20 years
that does not make it the best
well the information in it that sewed together the other 3 movies was brilliant
like how
learning about darth vander as a child
oh yea that was good
learning how Obie Won first started out
