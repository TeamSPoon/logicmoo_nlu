What was that song from Rocky?
The song from Rocky III?
I don't know which one it was.  I know it was a Rocky movie.
You are probably thinking of Eye of the Tiger.  It was a really popular song.
Oh, that's it.  It actually has the words, "Eye of the Tiger" in the lyrics.
Yeah, it's hard to forget.  It played during a classic scene.
Do you know who released that song?
I think it was Survivor.
Oh, I have heard of them.  Did they have any other popular songs?
I think they had a couple popular songs in the 80s.
Do you remember what they were?
No, I really don't.
Didn't they have a song on another Rocky soundtrack?
Now that you say it, I think they did.
Do you think they still tour?
They might.
Yeah , a lot of 80s bands tour now.
Yeah, I saw that Skid Row was touring recently.
Really?
Yeah, I was upset I had missed it.
