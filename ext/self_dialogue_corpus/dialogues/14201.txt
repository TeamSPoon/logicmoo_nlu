Did you go to one her Lady Gaga's concert for Monster Ball Tour?
No, but a friend did and said she was a debut artist.
I heard the tour was the highest gross for a debut artist.
Yeah, the tour made over 227 million.
There were over 200 shows and was seen in a few countries.
What were the songs sung during the tour?
Some of the songs were Just Dance, Vanity and Boys, Boys, Boys.
I wonder if she sang The Fame while on tour.
Not sure but I think we can goggles it to see.
I'm going to her next concert. I think the tour starts in 2017.
