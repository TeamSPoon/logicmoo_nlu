Man, Bleachers is one of the best things to come out of New Jersey in a long time.
Yeah Jersey seems to have something in the water down there in terms of music, and Bleachers is another example.
Yeah you're right, Jersey seems to produce amazing rock music.
Maybe it's the blue collar culture that Jersey has.
I'd say so, all started with Bruce Springsteen and went from there.
Yep, there's an undeniable level of quality out of that state.
But anyway back on Bleachers, their new album, Gone Now, is stupendous.
I have only heard Don't Take The Money off of it, glad to hear the rest is great.
Oh it's better than great, and Don't Take The Money is the song of the summer.
That I can totally see.
