Do you know much of Amy Winehouse's music?
I think I know a song or two of hers, but not many. What are some of her popular songs?
She did that song that was really popular years ago called "Rehab."
Oh yeah, I remember that song. What are some others?
Some of her other more well known songs include "Back to Black."
I'm not sure if I know that song or not. How many albums does she have?
She unfortunately only has a couple of albums, since she passed away at a young age.
That is sad. I definitely want to check them out though.
You should. They're both really great, but also very different.
How are they different?
Well the first one is like a jazz hip-hop mix, which is really cool. But it has a more jazzy feel to it.
And what about the second album?
Her second album is a bit more experimental in my opinion. Her sound changes a bit but she plays around a lot with melodies.
That is very cool. What is your favorite song of hers?
Well I can't choose just one. But some include Wake Up Alone, Me and Mr. Jones, and Some Unholy War.
I'll have to listen to those. I wonder what kinds of music she listened to.
I think she was influenced a lot by the type of music she listened to, but I know she loved Frank Sinatra and Donny Hathaway.
Are they jazz singers?
Frank Sinatra is, but I'm not sure what genre you'd classify Hathaway as.
I want to check them out, too.
