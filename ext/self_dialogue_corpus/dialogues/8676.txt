Do you think Hoobastank was a good band
I remember Crawling in the Dark but not much else.
They had the song The Reason as well.
Oh yeah I forgot about that.
I guess thats not a good sign
I mean they had a good 5 year run in them
They still make new music every year
But nothing that has broken though
Yeah nothing huge like those 2 songs
They were aided with interesting music videos which no one makes anymore.
