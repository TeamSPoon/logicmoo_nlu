How would you say Madonna's career arc has gone?
She has had her ups and downs
Lately shes had downs, i would say
Shes managed to not be controversial.
Her new music is terrible though
And that comes with the territory I believe.
In what respect?
She has been around for 40 years it seems, I think shes bound to dip.
Her 80s run was amazing though
She was the talk of the town.
I agree with you on that one
I wonder what happened to her music career though?
Producers could only do so much for so long
Dont you think its less about producing and more about something else?
Like that she was difficult to work with?
Could be that.
I dont think so you would have heard that awhile ago.
You never know to be honest.
I know it wasnt a social media world but still
She was a great musical artist.
