Have you seen The Conjuring 2?
Yes, I saw it in the theater when it was first released.
What did you think of it? Did you enjoy the movie?
Yes, in a way, but the way they tried to make it over the top kind of ruined it for me.
How so?
Well, I've done reading on the true story that inspired the movie, and to be honest, it was more scary than the film.
I thought the movie was terrifying!
Well, it had it's creepy moments, but for me, it takes away from the effect when they don't stay as close to the truth as possible.
Okay, so what in the movie wasn't true?
For one thing, there's no such thing as a Valak.
A Valak? Oh, you mean that demon dressed as a nun.
Yes, exactly, they just added that in. And I guess the doll, Annabelle, had nothing to do with the original story.
I guess they needed to link The Conjuring films to the Annabelle films.
Yes, exactly. But why add an entirely new demon that doesn't even exist then?
That's Hollywood for you. You need to be able to "see" the evil.
Yes, I guess you're right. An unseen force controlling things doesn't make for an exciting movie.
I guess you're just an old cynic.
I suppose I am!
All in all, I still thought it was a great film.
Eh, I give it a 6.
