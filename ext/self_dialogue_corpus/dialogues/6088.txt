The seaweed is always greener, in somebody else's lake.
You dream about going up there, but that is a big mistake.
I love the Little Mermaid, its one of my favorite movies.
Oh, I know, I've seen it about 100 times. Ursula still gives me goose bumps.
What's your favorite song from the Little Mermaid?
"Look at this stuff.... isn't it neat.... wouldn't you think my collection's complete... "
That's my favorite song too.
I know all the songs from the movie, I love all of them
What's your favorite scene from the little mermaid?
The part where Scuttle explains the human tools all wrong... hilarious
