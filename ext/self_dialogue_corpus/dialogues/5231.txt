What's your favorite Disney movie as an adult?
Whoo, interesting question, let me think, does Pixar movie count as Disney as well?
yea, Pixar belonged to Disney anyway
then It's definitely gonna be UP, you remember UP
yeah, a kid and an old man going on a special trip with a flying house
I can't believe I still remember it so vividly after so many years
me too. It's so heartwarming to see a couple getting old and love each other
yeah, I almost cried, it's the little sadness that reminds us the beatifulness in many things
that's a very reflective thought
I can't deny
