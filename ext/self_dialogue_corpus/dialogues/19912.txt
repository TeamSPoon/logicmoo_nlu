Have you heard the new Empire of the Sun album?
I've only heard one single from it on the radio. Is it good?
It's pretty decent. Much more like their first album than the second one.
Oh cool! I liked the first album a lot, but the second one was a little too electronic for my tastes.
I kinda agree. The second album felt like they had jumped on the whole Calvin Harris bandwagon.
That style of dance music was everywhere a few years ago.
Right, and I don't think there's anything wrong with expanding your style musically, but being trendy seems a little desperate.
So, what else have you been listening to lately?
I really like the new Spoon album.
I love the song Hot Thoughts. That's the title track, right?
Yeah, it is. They seem really rejuvenated since they took that long break after Transference.
They needed a break. Transference was terrible!
It wasn't terrible. It was just kinda mediocre compared to their other albums. Spoon really hasn't had a bad album.
I agree with that. I was exaggerating a bit about Transference. Spoon is a very solid band.
Yeah, they are! Not many bands can consistently bring out album after album of good material.
I can only think of a few. LCD Soundsystem, The National, and Arcade Fire all come to mind.
I am so excited about the new LCD Soundsystem album!
It's supposed to come out soon, right?
Pitchfork reported that it should be out within 6 weeks.
Good. That's going to make my summer.
