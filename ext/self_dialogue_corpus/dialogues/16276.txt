Do you listen to classical music?
What do you mean by classical? Do you mean classic rock?
Classical music is what they call symphonic or operatic music that is performed in concert halls.
You mean like a band?
It's kind of like the band you had in your high school, but it's a lot bigger. It's called an orchestra.
I don't think I've ever listened to an orchestra.
Really? Do you watch movies?
Yes, of course. What does that have to do with it?
Well, the music you hear in movies is performed most often by orchestras.
What's the difference between a band and an orchestra?
An orchestra is mostly made up of string players.
What's a string player?
A string player plays a stringed instrument.
You mean like a guitar?
A guitar is a stringed instrument, but orchestras don't have guitar players.
Then what stringed instruments do they have?
They have violins, violas, cellos and contrabases.
I've heard of violins, but not those other ones. What's a "cello"?
It looks like a big violin, but it's positioned upright and rests on your body while you're sitting down.
Oh yeah -- I've seen those on TV.
