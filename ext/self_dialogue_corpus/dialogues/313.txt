Wonderwoman is doing really well in the Box Office
It's surprising, since it doesn't seem like it would be so popular.
I think the fact that it's a good movie helped spread positive word of mouth.
Gal Gadot was terrifc in the movie and the action scenes were well done.
I really like the setting, it made the movie more dynamic
Do you think Wonderwoman could take on Spiderman?
It's hard to know, spiderman has his spidey senses.
It would be cool to see movie fights like that
I think Captain America Civil War did some interesting things with rivals.
Yea, Ironman was really killing it with his suit and one liners.
