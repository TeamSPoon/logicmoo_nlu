Did you ever see The Sword and the Stone?
is that a Disney movie?
Yes, the one about King Arthur as a youth.
Oh yeah, I remember that one. The one with Merlin.
Yes, Merlin the wizard. Takes him on as an apprentice.
Yes, that was a pretty good one. Don't they turn into different kinds of animals.
Yes, fish, squirrels, rabbits.
I recall his brother and father treated him badly.
I think it was his adopted/foster parents.
And then he grabbed the sword out of the stone.
