You like music, right?
Of course I like music.
I always hear you talk about music, and what you like.
Yeah, I've got some pretty strong opinions.
Right. But you always talk about that macho, heavy metal stuff.
I don't know how macho it is, I guess, but I like heavy music. A lot of it is about death and dark stuff, but some more is about elves and wizards, too.
But is that all you listen to?
No. I like other stuff. Mozart. And Indie rock.
What's your favorite indie rock band?
Definitely the Decemberists.
I would never have guessed that.
Well, they have some great tunes.
I like their older stuff.
Andy of their stuff is good. I think they have the best lyrics of any band I've ever heard.
I never noticed.
Pay attention. It's not just vocabulary. The rhymes are very clever and there's some incredibly intelligent phrasing.
What's a good album?
If you like their older stuff, listen to Picaresque
What about the Crane Wife?
It's good too, but a departure from their earlier, folkier sound. Still sounds unquestionably like Decemberists album, though.
