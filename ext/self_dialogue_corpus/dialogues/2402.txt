Hey, have you been following news of the Oakland raiders?
No, what's happening with them.
Well, this team has parted with 3 of their players.
Which ones did they let go?
I believe it was Andy Mulumba, Anthony Kukwa, and Neiron Ball.
No way, I wonder why.
I don't know about the other 2, but I do know that Ball missed last year, because of his knee injury and several surgeries.
Well that leaves this team with 3 vacanies.
Yeah and I wonder who will get to fill them.
Recently, I read about their former quarterback; Todd Marinovich.
Didn't he have a drug problem?
Yeah, but, he claims he has been sober since August of 2016.
Well good for him. He got let go back in 1993, right?
Yes. And sobriety is always good.
I will never understand the athletes that give into things that destroy their careers.
Right. It is not everyday that you make it to the NFL.
Ha ha, I could only dream.
I know that's right, my days are over; too old.
Your never too old, from what I hear, Todd Marinovich is 48 and trying for a comeback, but not with the NFL.
I heard. It is with the SoCal Coyotes of the World Developmental Football League. Good luck to him. Go Raiders!!
