Are you going to see the King Auther?
No, I think I wait for it to come out at Redbox.
Not that interested, huh?
No. Just don't want to get burned at the boxoffice.
I know. It always seems to be a little risky these days.
Are you going to go see it.
I am. I'm a bit of a nut for Arturian legend.
There are a lot of great stories on the subject.
Did you see the one with Clive Owen.
No. What was that like.
It was a little different.
How so?
Well, for starters it was set in a time when Rome was leaving Great Britain.
Oh, that's different.
Yeah, Auther was like a soldier for the Roman Empire, as well as his knights.
Weird.
Yeah, he gets set up as King at the end.
I might have to check that out.
I'd reccomend it.
Cool. Thanks!
