Have you watched that new movie 'The Belko Experiment'?
No I haven't; is it good?
It is CRAZY and keeps you on the edge of your seat!
I love those kinds of movies! What's it about?
A company named Belko and their employees get trapped inside and have to kill people or be killed by the people that trapped them inside.
Wow sounds gory.  Did you watch it alone?
No I can't watch scary movies alone.  I watched it with my husband.
I'm the same way LOL.
You should check it out.  I think you would like it.
Ok I will have to do that.
