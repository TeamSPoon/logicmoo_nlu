Have you heard any good live music recently?
Actually, I just got back from a Jimmy Buffet tour.
Is he still touring?
Yes, it's a little hard to believe at his age.
I would have thought that he went to Margaritaville a long time ago.
That's funny!
Thank you!
You're welcome! Do you know any other songs by him?
No, not really.
That's OK. "Margaritaville" is his most important.
Is he on a cruise?
I have no idea.
Cruises seem like the Buffet crowd.
Yes, they are laid back and older. I enjoy his music.
I might hear him on a beach somewhere as well.
I would assume so. He's so established in the culture.
I don't think I can name another of his songs, come to think of it.
That's OK. I know a lot of his songs.
I'll look him up when I get home.
You should. His music is relaxing and kind.
