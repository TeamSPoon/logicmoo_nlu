Have you seen the new Beauty and the Beast?
Yeah I did.
Did you think it was better than the original?
I wouldn't say better, but different.
Yeah, I think I enjoy the Disney version more.
Why is that?
Well, because it was when I was a kid, and had a more simple animation and story.
Yeah, but times evolve. Have you seen the new Alien?
Yeah I did, it was dope.
Really? I thought the story wasn't that good.
It was worse than the previous, but the special effects were better.
Yeah.
I wish they would come out with another prometheus.
Me too, I think the second one is coming out next year.
Cool, I haven't heard about that. I also have an alien tattoo?
Wow, how big is it?
It covers my leg.
Cool, I don't have any tattoos. How much do you pay to see a movie?
Around 12 dollars
Wow the one near me only charges 8.
