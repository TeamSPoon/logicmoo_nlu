Have you seen the movie Taken?
Yea, that's one of my favorite movies of all time.
I can't believe how good Liam Neeson was in that.
Yea, who knew he was such a tough guy.
What was your favorite scene?
I don't know, that's hard to choose. What's yours?
Mine is definitely when he gets the phone and tells his daughter that they are going to take her.
Yea that sent chills down my spine.
It's too bad the sequels weren't as good.
Yea, sequels rarely are.
