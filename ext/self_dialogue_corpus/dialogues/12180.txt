I thought Liam Neeson was in Star Wars, but I guess not.
No, he was in some of the movies.
Which one or ones?
I know he was in the Phantom Menace for sure.
He was Obi-Wan, right?
Oh no, Anakin hadn't befriended him at the time.
Then what was his name?
Qui-Gon Jinn I think.
Man, I remember nothing about his character to be honest.
He was kind of a boring Jedi honestly.
