In The Empire Strikes back what's something you don't like?
Well it's such a good movie that it's hard to come up with something I don't like but there's something that bother me in that movie?
I agree, it's almost a perfect movie. What bother you about it though?
Well in the Battle of Hoth, when Luke and another pilot bring down an AT-AT by deploying harpoons from their ship causing the AT-TI to fall.
What about it? That was a classic scene that many people love.
Well I always wondered why do space fighters have harpoons? There's no reason to have harpoons like that so it just seems to convenient to the plot.
There's an easy answer to that question. They might use them in space to attach to something and tow it.
That could be it. However they have tractor beams in the Star Wars universe so there's no need to use things like harpoons to tow stuff.
Well a tractor beam could be very large so it wouldn't fit on a small ship like the T-47 airspeeders that were used in the Battle of Hoth.
That makes sense. Now I love Empire Strikes Back even more.
