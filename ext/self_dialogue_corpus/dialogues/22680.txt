So what have you been up to this evening?
Not much, just been setting around watching some movies.
Sounds fun, what kind of movies have you been watching?
I decided to watch the Scream movies today.
Are you talking about the Wes Craven films?
Yes, they have always been my favorite horror movies.
They have made four of those, right?
Yes, I just wish they would come out with a part five!
Was Neve Cambell in all of those films?
She sure was! She is one of my favorite actresses.
I remember her way back from The Party Of Five show.
I do to, but I love her role as Sydney Prescott more so than any other.
Didn't the girl from the show Friends also play in those films?
You are talking about Courtney Cox. Yes she was in all of them as well.
Of the four Scream movies that they have made, which is your favorite?
I would have to say the original; that one is hard to beat!
I liked the original myself; but part three would be my pick.
Part three is actually my second favorite in the series.
I thought it was the scariest out of all the movies.
It was very scary, but the twist in the original can not be topped in my book!
