Do you think Owen and Deckard Shaw will return for the next Fast and Furious?
You mean Luke Evans and Jason Statham's characters?
Yeah I hope those two will return. It's odd that in The Fate of the Furious they became good after all the turmoil from the Furious 7 and the one before.
I think they will return. I really liked what they did with Jason Statham's character.
Me too! I liked that they gave him more action sequences. That whole scene on the plane with the baby was great in Fate of the Furious!
That scene was hilariously over the top but I loved it!
He was even at the lunch at Dom's house at the end!
That was a little weird. I get that he helped them because they helped him and his brother but that scene at the end with all of them so happy was a bit off.
I think you have to understand it goes back to Dom's loyalty to family and Deckard showing he holds the same value. So they found a common point between them.
You're right. I didn't think about that. I think We'll have Deckard returning as part of the crew from here on out.
