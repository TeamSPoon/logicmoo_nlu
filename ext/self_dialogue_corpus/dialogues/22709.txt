Have you seen the new Wonder Woman movie?
I haven't seen it yet, but it looks really good!
It is amazing!
Who did they get to play Wonder Woman?
An actress named Gal Gadot, she's a great fit for the role.
Have I seen her in anything before?
Well, she was in the last three Fast & the Furious movies.
Oh I have seen those, they are a lot of fun.
They are fun, but I think that Wonder Woman is even better for her. She gets to really show her skill.
That's wonderful. I was worried about this movie being bad.
Me too, I've wanted a Wonder Woman movie for a long time and I would have been disappointed if it had sucked.
Like the Jem and the Holograms movie? That was a wreck.
Exactly. With that one, I think the problem was that it wasn't a terrible movie, but it was a terrible Jem movie.
It's good to know that Wonder Woman really lived up to it's source material.
It really did. I'm excited for the sequels..
I hope they keep up the quality, sequels aren't always great.
I know but I have hope.
I should go see that movie now.
You should go see it. Right now, before it leaves the theater.
Ok, you buy the popcorn, I'll save the seats.
