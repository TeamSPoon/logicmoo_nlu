Who is your favorite Star Wars character?
Definitely Jar Jar Binks
What?
You heard me.
He's the most god-awful character there is and is just a massive racial stereotype. What good can you see in him?
He's a sith lord.
Oh no, you're not buying into that theory, are you?
Of course I am, why wouldn't I?
Because you're smarter than that. What's the evidence?
He's like Palpatine: appears helpless but is actually in control. He wiped out half a droid army with "goofiness"
