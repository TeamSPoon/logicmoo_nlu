Hey can you help me set up a playlist for tonights party?
Sure, are you doing it from music you own or a streaming service.
Oh I was gonna use my Spotify account.
Perfect.  So what kinda party music do you want.
Dance music would be good.
So like Hip-Hop or EDM or 80's?
All of that actually.
Ok, why don't we start with some recent music.  How about DNCE.
Who are they?
The lead singer is one of the Jonas Brothers.  They have that song "Cake by the Ocean."
Yes, I like that song. I also like that "Shut up and Dance with me" song.
Ok, I'll use those two song.  How about Turn down for What?
Is that Lil John.
Yes, and DJ Snake, he also does another song I'll add, Let me love you with Justin Beiber.
Well, I don't Like Justin Bieber, but I guess I can deal.  What else.
Yeah, DJ snake works with a lot of artist so he's a great source.
What about some 80's music.
I'll put some Biggie, Salt-N-Pepper, Duran Duran and House of Pain to generate some older songs.
Oh man, thanks for the help.  This playlist is amazing.
No problem, I can't wait to listen to it tonight.
