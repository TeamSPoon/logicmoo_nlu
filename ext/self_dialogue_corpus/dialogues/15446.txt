I want to talk about hip-hop. What are your thoughts on Common?
He has great songs but he expirements too much.
Ha ha, yeah, Electric Circus.  I think his songs are great.
I wish he would rap more than act.  Just Wright wasn't really that good.
I've seen worse, but I agree.  I want more songs like I used to Love H.E.R.
The best hip-hop artists are truly poets.  I feel the same way about Nas.
I agree.  That one song where he sings like he is a gun is brillant.
Ilmatic is still his best albulm.
Yeah, but Hip Hop is Dead is brillant as well.
I think my favorite song off that album was the one where he sampled Unforgettable.
You know, sampling is a tradition really borrowed from classical music.
I didn't know that.
Brahams sampled some of Handel's music and wrote his own variations.
I know that popular music in the mid-twentith century and rock 'n roll used some other music.
Yeah, like I'm Always Chasing Rainbows is based on Chopin.
And the Beattles used some classical pieces in their music.
So Hip-Hop really gets a bad rap (pun intended) about using other music.
Then you have groups like the Roots that have a live band.
I don't know how people realize they are a hip hop group.
I know!  I'm glad they are on the tonight show but I had to think about people forgetting their great rap songs.
