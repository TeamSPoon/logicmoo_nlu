Did you get a chance to see Wonder Woman yet?
Certainly did.  I was surprised by it.
How so?
It was much better than I anticipated.  I especially liked the war scene where she ran through the middle.
Yeah, that was a very emotional scene and very well-directed.
Gal Gadot played the character perfectly throughout.
It helps that she's pretty easy on the eyes.
That's an understatement.  She's beautiful.
I will probably end up seeing it again next week.  Want to go?
Sure.  Let's plan a time.
