Do you know if Rick Ross is working on a new album?
I imagine so he doesn't really seem like the type to just stop all of the sudden.
Yeah he seems driven to be successful.
That's exactly right.
Any clue when a new album of his might come out then?
Hard to say really maybe another year?  He seems to work hard on them for awhile.
That's sad but at the same time it's worth the wait.
Yeah it is.
Wonder if he'll work with any other rappers on this album.
Maybe, hope it's eminem.
