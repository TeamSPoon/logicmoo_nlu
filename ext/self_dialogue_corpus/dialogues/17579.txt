What's your favorite band?
First Aid Kit right now.
Didn't they sing that song Lion's Roar or something?
I was just thinking back to the bands I used to like a while ago. I used to really like Owl City.
What was your favorite song by them?
Something about a compass or north, I can't remember the name.  I also liked Honey and the Bee because that was cute.
Adam Young the singer, created the project while experimenting with music in his parents' basement
Yeah, I remember they first started out posting on MySpace.
I think their album Fireflies went platinum in the US.  They were big there for a while.
They were but I haven't heard anything by them in a while.
He's making scores now, I heard as his next project.
Have you ever heard the XX?  I've heard them compared to Owl City.
I have heard them and I really like them.  Their music is electronic sounding like Owl City but its more dark.
They are from England but I haven't heard anything from them in a while either.
They actually just released a new album this January.  It's called I See You.
Really?  They hadn't come out with anything for a while though right?
Yeah, it had been four years since their last album.
Is the new one any good?
I really like the song On Hold.  I think it did really well in the UK but I haven't heard it on the radio here.
I'll have to download it from Itunes.
