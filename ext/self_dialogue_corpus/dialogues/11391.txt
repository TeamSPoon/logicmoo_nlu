The band director just gave us our theme for the next football game. I know you're going to love it.
What's the theme?
The Beatles. They're one of your favorite bands, right?
I love their music! What songs will you be playing?
I don't know all the songs we're playing, we haven't got our music packets yet. I do remember the songs; Yellow Submarine, Hey Jude, and All You Need is Love.
Those are some of their more of their well known songs.
Which of their songs do you like?
I like most of their songs; but my favorites are Paperback Writer, Eleanor Rigby, We Can Work it Out, and Come Together.
I'll let you know when I get the packet. We can listen to the songs together.
We can listen at my house. I have my dad's old record player, and several of their albums.
