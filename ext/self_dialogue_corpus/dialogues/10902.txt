What's your favorite Fast and Furious movie?
The original for sure.
I like the Furious 7.
They were all good.
Who was your favorite character?
Paul Walker for sure.
I like Vin Diesel.
I heard he is short and wears lifts in his shoes.
Too bad that Paul Walker died.
Yeah but he went out doing what he loved.
