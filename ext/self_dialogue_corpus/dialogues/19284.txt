OK, pop quiz: what's the greatest rock album of the 80's?
Well, that's obvious: Bon Jovi's "Slippery When Wet"!
That's the correct answer! It's an almost perfect album!
It was amazing how many of those song went top 40.
My favorites are "Living on a Prayer" and "You Give Love a Bad Name."
You've hit the classics, my friend! And while we're quizzing either other: what's the greatest rock ballad of the 80's?
Clearly, "Never Say Goodbye."
Truer words were never spoken! Its a great song about love, loss, regret, and it has a great sound to it.
Rock bands get a bad rap for not being very talented or for using redundant sounds. I think that the guys in Bon Jovi are genuinely talented.
That's true; they are legitimate musicians and very skilled in making music.
Even some of the non-hits on that album are great.
I know! I love "Raise Your Hands" and "Wild in the Streets."
Those non-hits are better than the so-called "hits" on many other albums.
That's true. Most bands never attain to that level of great rock.
Speaking of the few non-hits, I really love "Let It Rock" and "Without Love."
I also like the variety of the songs, including a more western sounding rock song like "Wanted Dead or Alive."
Bon Jovi tends to have more variety than most bands. Their album "New Jersey" has some good variety also.
I've listened to that one a bit; its another great album.
I especially like "Bad Medicine" and "I'll Be There For You."
And songs like "Homebound Train" and "Stick To Your Guns" demonstrates their variety of styles.
