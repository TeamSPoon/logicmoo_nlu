One thing I find very entertaining about Super Bowl are the commercials.
The really come up with some innovative commercials.
Do you know who is credited with the first famous Super Bowl commercial?
Yes. It's Joe Namath.
I don't know who he is.
He was a quarterback mainly known for the New York Jets, although he ended his career playing for the Los Angeles Rams.
What was the commercial for?
It was for Noxema Cream.
What's that?
It's a shaving cream.
Well, I have never seen that commercial, but I do have a favorite Super Bowl commercial.
What's that?
It was a commercial with frogs croaking out Budweiser.
I think I remember seeing that.
Another one I liked was a Pepsi commercial with Brittany Spears.
Oh that was really like a music video.
It was and I liked it a lot.
A lot of celebrities have contributed to Super Bowl commercials.
Just look at the Honda commercial from the lst Super Bowl.
I know. I wish I could have been there to watch them record it.
