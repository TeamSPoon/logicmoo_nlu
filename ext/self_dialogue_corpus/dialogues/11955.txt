Of all the Star Wars movies, which one did you like the most?
I think The first Star Wars movie remains my favorite. It introduced us to the space opera with wonderful characters that to this day remain relevant.
That's true. I mean Luke Skywalker is going to be in the Last Jedi movie and Kylo Ren is Han Solo's son which makes Han Solo relevant despite his death.
I wish they hadn't killed him off so quickly after introducing him in the Force Awakens.
I guess they wanted to continue the story with a new generation of Jedi.
Rey will make a great Jedi but they need to show more of her powers than they did in the Force awakens.
Maybe that's the whole point of bringing Luke Skywalker back for the Last Jedi movie.
I doubt he'll be as funny as Yoda was with him in the Empire Strikes Back.
No one is as funny or as wise as Yoda!
It'll be interesting to see how Luke and Rey's relationship unfolds in The Last Jedi.
