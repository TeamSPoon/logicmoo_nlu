Taylor Swift and her music is so popular!
That's true. I like her music.
Some of her videos are funny too.
Like which one?
Shake it Off. I laughed pretty much the entire time.
That song has a catchy tune.
At a party I was at, the DJ played that song.
Did a lot of people dance?
Some got up and performed the dance routine from the video.
That's crazy! Sounds you had a nice time though.
