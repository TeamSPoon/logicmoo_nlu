Do you like Tom Cruise movies?
I really liked Top Gun.
Oh yeah, that was a good one.
Yes, Maverick and Goose.
And don't forget Ice Man
Oh yeah and Slider.
Great volleyball scene
Well, if you're into that type of stuff.
And then the love scenes
Oh yeah, my first time seeing a lot of kissing on screen
Some intense fighting scenes as well
Both in the air and on the ground
Tom Skerritt was in it as well
Yes, he played Viper the instructor
I heard there's a sequel coming out.
Yeah, I heard that too.
I hope it's okay.
Me too, sometimes it's best to leave the original alone.
Although when Goose died that was really sad
Yes, very sad.
