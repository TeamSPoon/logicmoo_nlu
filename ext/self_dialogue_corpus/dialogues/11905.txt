What's your favorite Beatles song?
I really like "Yesterday".
Yeah, that's a great one.
What's your favorite?
"I've Just Seen a Face".
Really? I've never heard of that one.
It's one of their earlier songs. It was featured on the Help! album.
I don't think I've ever listened to that one all the way through.
I think it's also in the movie by the same name.
Cool, I'll definitely check it out!
