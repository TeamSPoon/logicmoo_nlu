Is it football season yet?
Not quite, but I am ready.
Think Dallas will win the division again this year?
No actually, I'm picking another team.
You going with the Giants?
Actually no, I'm betting on the Eagles.
That's a surprise.
I like their chances.
I dunno, it's been a while since they were competitive.
Randall Cunningham days i assume.
Yes, I miss the old Eagles with Jaworski.
He was a gritty quarterback.
Dick Vermeil was a great coach.
He took the Rams all the way.
Wish he had done that here.
He did get the Eagles to the Superbowl.
There were some great player on that team.
I loved Wilbert Montgomery.
I was a big fan of Harold Carmichael.
That was a great receiver.
