Last night I finally saw a movie you told me about like two years ago.
Which one is it?
"Casa de Mi Padre".
Man, I laughed so hard with that movie.
I saw it by myslef because I knew my wife would hate it.
Yeah, that is our sense of humor, not our wives'.
She would have also made me look away in the nude scene.
What a beauty that actress is, right?
Such a beautiful woman. And Will Farrell is extraordinary, speaking Spanish and all.
Man, I couldn't stop laughin!
Everything is so intensly spoken. And the bad quality of the special effects makes everything even better.
Yes, the tiger is so funny! And the cow at the biginning.
I thought it was so funny when in the first scene the three guys on the horses were just "kind of laughin" for like 3 minutes.
It was so funny! I think it was a hard concept to work on and get a good result, but they definitely did it.
Yeah, an over acted soap opera, but making it genuinely funny.
They did it perfectly.
I mean, Will Farrell is a master of comedy, but this was a risky move.
Yes. I don't know what the critics said about it.
The important thing is for us to enjoy it.
Totally agree.
