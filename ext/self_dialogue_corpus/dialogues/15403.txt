Have you ever seen Amon Tobin live?
No, I have always wanted to go to his production but never have.
Same here, it looks amazing with the projections and animations to the music.
Yea, though I like his newer music less than his old.
I feel the same way, you like Permutation the best?
Maybe Supermodified but Permutation is great too.
Those are the top 2 albums of his for me.
Same thing here, just not sure on the order.
What is your favorite song of his?
I would have to say Slowly or Four Ton Mantis.
Both right near the beginning of the album, I can see why you like Supermodified.
Yea, that is probably why.
I heard that he will be touring again this year?
Really?  When will he be around?
He has not announced the cities yet but I heard in December.
Would you want to try to go?
I would love to.
Let me know if you hear about tickets or dates but I will keep an eye out.
Same here!  Hopefully we can go!
Yea, it will be a great time!
