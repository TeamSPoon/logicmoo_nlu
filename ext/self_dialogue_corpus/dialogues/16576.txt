What kind of music do you like listening to the most?
I don't listen to much new music, but I like a lot of older songs.
What's your favorite style of music?
I love old school rap and R and B.
I like that kind of music too.
Yeah, I listen mostly to older music instead of newer hits.
Do you ever listen to a band called The Gap Band?
They are one of my favorite groups!
They have been around a long time, but their music still sounds so new.
I completely agree with you. They are my favorite old school funk band for sure.
Do you know what their first album was called?
It was called "Magicians Holiday" and I think it was released in 1974.
Man, that is a long time ago!
I know! It didn't really have any songs that made the top charts but it is a really good album.
I will have to look it up and see if I can listen to it.
I think you would really like it if you like their style overall. It's worth the listening time.
What is your favorite song that they ever made? I think that one of my favorite songs is "Early in the Morning", but I couldn't just pick one song!
Did that song come out in 1982? I remember they had a lot of hits that year.
Yep, it sure did, and Robert Palmer re-did the song in 1988. It was great too.
I guess my all time favorite from The Gap Band is the song called "Outstanding".It came out in 1982 also. It was such a great ballad.
