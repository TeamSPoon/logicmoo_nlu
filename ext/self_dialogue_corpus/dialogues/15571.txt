I hate classical music!
You ever see Yuja Wang?
You'd Ja Wang -- what!?
She's one of the greatest ivory ticklers in the world and still in her 20's.
Have you seen her?
About 9 years ago at the San Francisco Symphony.
What did she play?
Prokofiev's "Piano Concerto No. 2" -- it was almost as much an athletic as artistic performance.
Was she wearing sports attire?
She was decked out in classical music gown chic.
What was so good about it?
All I remember is the seemingly endless blizzard of 16th notes of the second; the swirling arpeggios, the extreme swings in dynamics, the frantic tirade of galloping chords up and down the keyboard...
I'm tired just listening to you talk about her.
You were born half-asleep, so that doesn't tell me much.
Go on.
It was only the sturdy, persistent structure of the orchestra kept the tornado at the front of the stage from burning the house down.
Were there fire extinguishers on stage?
No, but there should have been.
I actually might check her out.
You won't fall asleep, I promise you!
