I could talk about my love for the Fast & Furious series all day.
I wish I could say the same.
You're not a fan?
Not too much. Action movies just aren't my type.
Well, that's fine. There's more to it than just action.
Such as what?
There's plenty of drama in it, and there's also a bit of family-oriented stuff in there as well.
I don't know. The action seems to outweigh everything else.
Oh, then I guess you won't really like the films much.
I thought about the same thing.
