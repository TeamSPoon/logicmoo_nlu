I wish the movies did not cut out parts of harrys home life
They covered most of it
But so little time was spent on it as it was in some of them
Well they did not neglect it all though
They could have covered more
I think it was to keep it to a certain time
Still
Just be thankful for what they did get
I guess
It could have skipped more
