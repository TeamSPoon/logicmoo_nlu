Did you ever see Snatch?
Yeah, what a great movie.
My favorite charachter is Brad Pitt.
Who'd he play.
He was like the leader of the Gypsies.
Oh, Yeah!
How could you forget/
It's been a while since I've seen it.
Understandable.
But he was really good.
You know who I really liked?
Who?
Benicio Del Torro.
That guy is always good.
Will he be in the next Guardians of the Galaxy.
I think so.
Good.
Are you gonna catch that in the theater/
I was thinking about it.
If you do, let me know.
