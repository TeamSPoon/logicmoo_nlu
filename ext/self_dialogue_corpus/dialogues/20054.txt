What kind of movies do you like?
I love scary ones. You?
I do too.  One of the scariest I've seen is The Strangers with Liv Tyler.
I saw that too!  Very suspenseful!
I think it was even scarier because it was based on a true story.
Kind of like that scary movie, Annabelle....the one with the doll.
That was was really creepy too.  What other movies do you like?
I just saw Patriot's Day.  That was incredible!
Yes it was.  Mark Wahlberg is such a good actor.  I can't believe how closely the movie followed the actual events.
It was pretty good.  I couldn't take my eyes off of it.  Another good one is Hacksaw Ridge.  That's a true story too.
I saw that. Very inspirational.  I can't believe how good the acting was in that movie.
What is your favorite comedy?
I love Stepbrothers.  Nobody is funnier than Will Ferrell.
He is great.  I loved him in Elf!
I liked him and Wahlberg in Daddy's Home.
Also a great movie.  How did you like Ferrell in Talladaga Nights?
Wasn't one of my favorites, but I guess it's worth a watch.
How did you like Wahlberg in Fear?  Kind of a scary movie but more of a thriller.
It was great, but I like him more in funny roles.  Like Ted.
Ted is  a great movie, but the first one was better than the sequal.
