Have you seen the second John Wick movie?
Not yet, but I loved the first one!
Almost two hours of headshot after headshot is so awesome!
I heard it has a crazy ending too
I cant spoil it for you though!
I wonder if there will be a third movie!
They imply that there will be.
Oh man, I can't wait!
You need to see the second one though!
Okay I'll watch it tonight!
