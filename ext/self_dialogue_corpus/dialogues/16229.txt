I found a really fun Heavy Metal group.
Fun? How can heavy metal be "fun"? It's supposed to be grim and violent.
The group's based in Switzerland. They're called Black Eagle.
Black Eagle? Oh, brother.
Unlike most heavy metal, you can understand every word they sing.
Well, that is strange.
Their language is mostly clean, so I think they'd be great for video game soundtracks or action movies.
Like what kind of songs do they do?
Well, they do a few cover songs, including "House of the Rising Sun", and a bunch of Iron Maiden, Black Sabbath, even Deep Purple songs.
Do they have anything original?
Yes. They've got a few songs they've written themselves.
They're on Soundcloud or somewhere?
I don't know if they're on Soundcloud, but I found them on Reverbnation. Really fun, punchy guitar work and vocals.
I've got to look this up.
They have a great song called "Pieces Of Pain".
"Pieces Of Pain?" Sounds like lots of fun, if you like getting an earache.
No, it would be really great in a video game.
Like a soundtrack to blowing people up?
There's really no violence in their songs, strangely, and you can understand every word they sing.
That does sound like a pretty odd group for heavy metal.
