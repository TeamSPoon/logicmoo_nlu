What is your favorite type of music?
Indie rock.
Oh, really? What artists are your favorite?
I really like Arctic Monkeys, The Fratellis, and the Strokes.
That's awesome! I like them too! What's your favorite song from the fratellis?
It would have to be Desperate Guy?
How come?
I just really like the mellow rhythm and procession in the song. What's your favorite song at the moment?
Mine is Naive by the Kooks.
Oh, I haven't heard of them. Are they and indie rock band too?
Yeah! This song is actually pretty popular. It's their best song.
You'll have to show me some time.
Yeah, I'll send you a link later. The music video is kind of interesting too.
Ight, I'm looking forward to it. DO you like Arctic Monkeys?
Yeah! My roommate plays them all the time, so I've heard a good bit.
What's your favorite song?
Marty Bum. It just has the cleanest vocals and isn't overplayed for me.
That's fair. At least you didn't say Florescent Adolescence.
Yeah, that's true. That song got old quick.
It's not a bad song, just got way too much air time.
