You know the kinds of movies that I wish they would make?  The ones like Buster Keaton used to make!
You mean ones that were heavy on the physical comedy?
Well, sure -- they *did* have a lot of physical comedy, but they also had a satisfying story to them too.
Like Charlie Chaplin in Modern Times?
Exactly! The physical comedy was a part of it -- you knew the moviemaker was just playing with you -- but the story had a payoff too.
Like in The General by Buster Keaton: comedy, adventure, romance; but there *was* a interesting story.
Right.  Who do you suppose makes movies like that anymore?
I'm thinking Liar, Liar by Jim Carrey: there was a comedic story, there was physical comedy -- but there was also a moral, and a heart.
Yeah, Jim Carrey is who I was thinking of too.  Did you ever see Man on the Moon?
No, I don't think so. Wait, was that the one with the song by R.E.M.?
That's the one. It's actually the biography of Andy Kaufman, who sometimes showed up on Saturday Night Live.
The guy who would wrestle women? That was kind of a weird schtick!
Yep, but even though it was a biography, it had comedy, and a heart.  It's too bad Andy Kaufman didn't become a movie star!
Well, he had the 'physical comedy' part down -- that's for sure. Wrestling when people expected jokes: who knew?
And he kind of had the 'stone face' that Keaton was famous for: you never knew if Andy was sincere -- or putting you on!
You know who I'm thinking of: Adam Sandler! Would he be someone like Buster Keaton?
Oh -- that's a good choice!  Remember Happy Gilmore: that golfing comedy?
Yeah!  Or how about Bill Murray in Caddyshack?
Or Bill Murray in Stripes -- or Groundhog Day?
I see what you mean: comedy, heart and action -- all rolled into one! You're right: we need more movies like that!
