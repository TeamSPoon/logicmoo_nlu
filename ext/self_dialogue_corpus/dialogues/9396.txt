Do you like the rapper Danny Brown?
Not really. His voice is so odd.
What do you mean by that?
His voice is very nasally and whiney. I don't like the way it sounds.
Bur what about his lyrics? Do you like those?
They aren't bad. But it is hard to get past his voice.
You should listen to songs like "When It Rain" or "Really Doe"
Do you think I would like them?
I do! Even though you might not like his voice. I think those songs are impressive enough that you can overlook it.
Ok then. I'll take your word for it and check them out.
