What is your favorite Disney movie?
I love Beauty and the Beast.
Did you see the live version yet?
No, not yet.
It did really well in theaters.
I saw that. I am waiting till it comes on demand or Netflix.
Why are you waiting?
I am not sure that I will be happy with a live version and I didn't want to spend the money.
That is understandable.
If it is as good as the live Jungle Book was, then I will like it.
