Liek what? Doing culturally sensitive politically correct BS is not expanding
Not that, but their works with Pixar has led to some of the greatest animations of all time.
Ah yes, Pixar. But that's such a departure from Disney style animation.
Which says,,, what? That they're expanding They're including more style of animation.
What's the newest from Pixar anyway?
