Do you remember the Nightmare on Elm Street movies?
Oh, those were my favorite!
Mine too!  I really loved Freddie Kreuger!
He was such a unique villain.
Yeah, you never knew what he was going to do.
Or what was real.
I don't even mind the remakes.
Yeah, but the classics are always the best.
Yeah, there can only be one Freddie.
I can't even see him on TV without thinking Freddie!
