We should totally go see the new star wars movie together.
The Last Jedi? I am so down.
Yeah, it's supposed to be out on December 15th.
We should go to the premiere.
Like the night it opens?
Yes, we'll probably have to wait in line a few hours but the premieres are always the coolest!
I'm down I guess. Do you dress up?
We can if you want to!
I think it would be fun. Want to go as Hans and Chewy?
I'm so down. I call Chewy!
