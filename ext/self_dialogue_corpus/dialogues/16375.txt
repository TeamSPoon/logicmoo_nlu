Have you ever listened to the band Thursday?
No I have not, what kind of music?
I would say post hardcore.
I have never heard of that genre.
Its like harder rock and hardcore but minus heavy screaming
Sounds interesting.
I love it and they perfected it.
I will check them out whats their best album?
The album is called Full Collapse.
When was it released?
2002 it came out on what was an indie label called Victory Records.
Oh wow I have heard of that label.
They dont treat their bands well
How so?
I dont know specifics but alot of their former roster sues them eventually.
They sign contracts and know what is going on.
True I just dont think they read the fine print sometimes.
Where is the band from?
A city in New Jersey, I think New Brunswick.
I used to live there, I will definitely listen to them now.
