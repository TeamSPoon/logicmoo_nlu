Whats your favorite comedy about school?
Probably the movie called Accepted.
Oh, that's a great one. Isn't that one of Jonah Hills earliest movies?
Yeah, it is. He was really fat back then.
Haha, but still funny though. My favorite school movie is School of Rock.
That's the one with Jack Black right?
Yeah where he pretends to be a substitute teacher and makes a rock band out of his class.
That movie is great, I haven't seen it in a while though.
That's a shame you should watch it again sometime.
I probably will, now that you mentioned it.
