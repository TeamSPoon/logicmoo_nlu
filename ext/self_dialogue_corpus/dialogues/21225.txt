Have you seen the new Justice League Movie?
No. It doesn't come out until November.
I meant the prequel to that movie. You know Batman Vs Super Man.
Yep. I saw that one when it first hit the theaters.
I just bought the dvd and watched it last night.
What did you think?
I don't know if I like Ben Affleck as Batman.
I felt the same way. We've been spoiled by Christian Bale.
He is the ultimate actor for playing Bat Man.
I agree. Those Dark Knight movies were epic.
They were the best Bat Man movies to date.
I agree 100%.
But this Bat Man vs Super Man movie, ugh I didn't like it too tough.
Why not?
It didn't feel right. I couldn't get into it.
You just want Christian Bale to return to his role as Bat Man.
He was, is and forever will be the Dark Knight.
But he was tired of loosing his voice playing the Bat Man.
I understand. I just feel like taking that DVD back and getting my money back.
It wasn't that bad.
