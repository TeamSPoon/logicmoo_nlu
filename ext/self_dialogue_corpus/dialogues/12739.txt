How many of the Star Wars movies have you seen so far?
I have seen all of them!
Even the cartoon ones?
No.  I guess I have only seen all of the blockbuster ones.
Which one was your favorite?
I loved Empire Strikes Back!  It was so intense.
I kind of liked Rogue One, Just because it was a break from the old story a little bit.
I loved that story too!  Especially the romance parts.
Diego Luna is definitely a good looking guy, his accent is fabulous.
Felicity Jones was awesome as well in that movie.
