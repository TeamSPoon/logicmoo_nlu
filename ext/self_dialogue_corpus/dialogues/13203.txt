Which character did you find most annoying in Star Wars?
C3PO-- I always thought he was such a coward.
You know what's funny?  Before I saw the movies, I only had the figures, and since he was gold, I figured he was the best.
Haha, far from it.  Which character did you find to be most annoying?
Definitely Jar Jar.
Yeah, he single handedly ruined the Phanton Menace.
Only a character as moronic as Jar Jar could ruin a movie with Darth Maul.
The fight scene with him taking on Qui-Gonn and Obi-Wan is the only redeeming thing about that movie.  And, Watto.
You like Watto?
Yeah! He was cute in a weird way, and kinda funny.
