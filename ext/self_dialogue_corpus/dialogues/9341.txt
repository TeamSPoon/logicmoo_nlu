Eminem is my favorite rapper of all time. Who is your favorite rapper?
I love Eminem but my favorite would have to be Snoop Dogg.
What's your favorite Snoop song?
Gin and juice.
Have you seen his new music video?
No, What is it called?
It is called Moment I Feared and it is really good.
I'll have to check it out.
Some say he is dissing new rappers in the song.
I'll take a listen and let you know what I think.
