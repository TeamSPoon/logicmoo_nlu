Do you remember that song we used to sing back when we was little
You got to be more specific than that with some of you talking about
like those times we go on road trips and we always used to sing this song like 2 or 3 times
I don't know how old was we
Real young like 6 or 7 but that song is stuck in my head and I can't get it out
How does it go can you hum it for me
Hm I can try hm hm hm
Yeah I don't know what song you're talking about but I know what you can do you can go ask Mom and Dad
Yeah they probably wouldn't know better than us
Wait I think I know what song it is. is it that Michael Jackson song
Which Michael Jackson song are you talking about
I think it used to be mirror right that's the song We song
Yep that's it you finally got the song out of my head I got to play it now
Yeah Michael Jackson used to be the greatest back then he just fell off
Yeah I don't know what happened with Michael Jackson maybe all that Neverland Scandal stuff
Regardless of all that Scandal and whatever they said he did his songs are pretty good
What other Michael Jackson songs do you like
I like that one where it was the horror movie won it was a long sound like 13 minutes I think was called Thriller
Oh yeah I remember that one member that party we went to and it was playing that song Back the back that Halloween party
I can't remember that probably was too drunk
