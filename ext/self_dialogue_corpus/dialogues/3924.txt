So how about I saw that new movie with the chick from the Fast and Furious movies...
What chick?
I believe her name is Michelle Rodriguez.
Is she the one that dated the character played by Vin Diesel?
Yeah that's her.
Do you remember what the name of this new movie was?
Yeah, It was called "The Assignment".
Would you recommend it?
Somewhat. It was alright, but the movie line is a bit controversial.
Awesome, that makes it even better.
