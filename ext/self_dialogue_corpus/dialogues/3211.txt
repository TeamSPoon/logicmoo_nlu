But the passer rating doesn't account for the team efforts.
Well, it's as they say. it's a passer rating. Not a rating of a performance as the quarterback.
There is absolutely no difference between the two.
Well, the distinction is that to rate a passer on HIS efforts alone is different from rating the plays of quarterback ina game..
Again, there is absolutely no difference between the two.
yes there is, we're only interested in the efforts of the passer. how his team pass protects, or how the receivers holds on to the ball isn't a passer rating
That's such a nonsense. Of course all that has to be reflected on the passer rating
No it shouldn't. What you're talking about is more like offense rating, which we can do.
What method do you use for fantasy? Ideally what would you like to see?
I would like to see the total offense rating as well as the passer rating, but over time against each matchups. But that doesn't really work since the teams evolve and change their offensive cooridators
New coordinators, new approaches, so the performances will be different?
Excatly. It's back to that whole stochastic nature of the agents performing the tasks. There is no way to predict, but we can extrapolate the trends
if you can't predict, there is no point in looking for the trends.
Oh contraire. Trends give us, at least, some insights into how the game will unfold, not 100% at a time, but very often
Well, I guess nothing in life is 100%.
Nope.
it will be cool to have s number like that against the each matchups.
ESPN analysts do have numbers like that, and that's how they calculate the pecentage win for each matchups. And often they're wrong
Stochastic agents again
You got it.
