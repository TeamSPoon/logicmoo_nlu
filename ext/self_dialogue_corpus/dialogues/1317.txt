Yea, Seattle is really going to have to play defense if they expect to win.
Yea, they may not fill up the score board anymore.
Exactly! And without Marshawn Lynch, they have no goal line punch.
Yea, it might be tough without him, but they will manage.
I would personally look out for San Francisco this year.
You would? Is that a joke?
Yea, it is. They are going no where.
I was starting to wonder what happened to you.
Yea, I do not actually think they have a prayer. They have nothing.
Yea, well at least they do not have Chip anymore. That guy just didn't have it at this level.
Yea, he kinda succeeded his first year and then fizzled.
Yea, thats what the guy seems to do. He just got gradually worse.
Yea, we will see if he ends up back in the league.
That is true. I think his chances of getting back are the same as Tim Tebow's.
Yea, both have almost no chance.
Yea, I agree. Its sad for both
Yea, maybe one day they will both resurface.
I wouldn't count on it. I'll tell you that!
Yea, I agree. They were one year wonders.
Hey! Maybe Tebow can crack the Mets roster though!
