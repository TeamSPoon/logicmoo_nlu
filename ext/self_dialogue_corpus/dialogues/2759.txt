How do you thin Tampa Bay will do this year?
About where they are right now, 9-7
Famous Jameis Winston is good though
Not that good...
What do you mean
QBR rating of 65 last year
So he had too many interceptions?
Yup...18 of them
Didn't know he had that many
And a lot of them were bad one too
Think Brent Grimes is any good
Yup, in spite of his wife
Yeah but leave her out of it...lol
Yeah he got ran out of Miami because of her
Well he came back with Tampa last year
Running game needs some help too
Zeke ran for more than the whole team last year.
Didn't know that...wow that's bad
Real bad...don't see it getting any better either
Can't get any worse
