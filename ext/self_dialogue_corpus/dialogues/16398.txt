Do you like Adele?
Yeah, I like some of her songs.
Do you have a favorite song from Adele?
I loved that song Set Fire to the Rain, it was epic.
OMG yeah I loved that song also.
Yea, Set Fiiiiiiyaaaaahhhh to the Raaaaiiin watch it burn as I call your name.
She is so passionate when she sings.
She really is. And it's cool that she became such a big star despite her issues.
What do you mean her issues?
Well she is much bigger than the average pop star. And she's British.
Isn't it strange how an American female singer would never be allowed to be that famous if she was fat?
Totally! I think it's really unfair. After all it's about music, not how you look,
That's the big problem with Pop music these days though. It's so much about looks.
I totally agree. It's a big problem and it takes away from great music.
I hear you. I think that we should go back to the days like in the 70's when it was just about good music.
Those days were wild. I have heard my parents' music and the artists just looked like regular people.
Yeah but with amazing talent.
Totally amazing talent.
I should get some names of the artists your parents listened to and check them out.
Ok cool, I will WhatsApp you some names. There are some really great songs and artists from that time.
