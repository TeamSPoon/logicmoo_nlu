Who is your favorite bubble gum pop princess of the 80's?
That is either Tiffany or Debbie Gibson.
Those two where definitely bubble gum.
Tiffany's music was not as good as Debbie Gibson's though.
Yeah Debbie wrote all her music and played the piano in her songs.
Yes, she is very talented.
I actually like the song Electric Youth.
It had a fun keyboard solo in hit.
Tiffany redid a lot of other hits like I think we're alone now.
Yes, that was a Beetle's song.
She did a good job with it though.
It is tough to redo a classic especially a Beetle's song.
I actually didn't know it was a redo until someone told me.
See that is what I mean, Debbie Gibson was original.
So then Debbie Gibson would probably be your favorite pop bubble gum princess.
I guess if I have to go with plain originality, then yes.
Ok, that makes sense.
Yep she is a more talented artist.
My favorite by her is Shake Your Love.
I prefer Out of the Blue.
