Remember the movie, 'Wall-E?'
Of course I remember.  It was such a great movie.
I saw it again the other day.  I forgot how satirical it was.
Which were some of the satirical elements that stood out to you?
I thought that it was really biting, especially about consumerism and environmental concerns.  How about for you?
I liked the elements you mentioned, and I also liked that they addressed the concerns of obesity.
I forgot about that one.  I can't believe a children's movie was that complex.
Isn't it great?  I love that movies like 'Wall-E' and other Disney films are great for people of all ages.
That is a sign of great writing.  Speaking of, do you know who directed it?
It was directed by Andrew Stanton.
