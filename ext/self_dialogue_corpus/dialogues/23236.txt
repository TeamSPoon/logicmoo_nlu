So what kind of movies do you like?
I love spy and espionage themed movies!
Do you mean like James Bond?
Well, I have seen all of them but it goes deeper than that!
Like what?  Bourne Identity?
You know, I actually really did enjoy those.   I thought the fight scenes were well choreographed.
Now that you mention it, they really were!
Yes, and I thought Matt Damon did an excellent job in the lead role.
So which actor was your favorite Bond?
Mine would be Roger Moore.
Interesting...why is that?
Partly because I grew up in the 80's.  I also didn't really like any of the later ones.
I thought Timothy Dalton was underrated.
To a certain extent, maybe.  Daniel Craig was the worst!
Why do you say that?
I just didn't buy all his brooding looks.  He's also a strange looking man who thinks he's attractive.
Yea, you have a point there.  What about Sean Connery?
He was the original, I think, so I could see why people would say he was the best.
He's definitely my favorite.  Is he even still acting?
I really don't think so but I'm not sure...
