Are you coming over Wednesday?
Why?
NFL Supplemental Draft!
Like anything is going to happen. There were a total of ZERO Picks last year.
Maybe, but I love the hype.
Bingham's a decent DL, but I wouldn't give up one of next year's picks for him.
What about Marques Rogers? He was a serious threat RB.
Exactly - WAS. He was ineligible in 2016. Taking a whole year off makes that just too risky.
So what do you think the Titans did by taking Adoree Jackson with the 18th Pick?
Point taken.
Seriously, a 5' 10" CB?
I know, but he plays offense too. Not a bad Pick in my mind. Besides, I'd rather take someone steady like that than a Wild Card.
Who?
Conley. I wouldn't take someone with his criminal past unless I had to.
Yes, Off-Field drama can detract from a player's value, but the Raiders really need someone like Gareon.
They would've done just as well with Jabrill Peppers.
No, he's too slow. He's got good size, but isn't quick enough.
He ran the 40 in 4.46!
The speed that counts is during a play - He doesn't react.
Well now it sounds like you
