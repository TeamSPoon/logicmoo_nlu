What do you think will be the big hit for this summer as far as clothes?
For Men or Women?
I guess for men
I dont know hopefully not cut off denim shorts again
I dont know this seems like its trending everywhere
I dont get it, dont people call them "jorts?"
Yeah, but hipsters love irony
They do, but they cant keep it up
What do they do with their jeans
Buy new ones each year.
How about for women?
I don't know I am not an aficiondao
Well every year its something new
Could be sun dresses again
Maybe, but I feel like that was overdone
Nah, they can hide their bodies
Dont do that! I think its a mistake
People want to feel comfortable in the heat
Speaking of, does every guy wear the same Ray Ban sunglasses?
Seems like it if you lived on Instagram
