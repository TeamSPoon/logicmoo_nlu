I am ready to watch some football!
Well the NFL will be here before you know it.
Trust me, I have been counting down the days!
What team do you cheer for?
I am a Buffalo Bills fan all the way!
Were you around when they lost four straight Superbowl's?
I sure was, those four years were probably the most heartbreaking years of my life in terms of being a sports fan.
I am sure they were rough to get through. What was the hardest part about all of those games?
I think the hardest part was just being so close and still never getting over the hump.
Do you ever the think the Bills will ever get back to being that good?
I am not sure. I do not think we will ever go to four straight Superbowl's again.
I am not sure if any team will ever go to four straight again.
You are probably right about that actually. I would love just to get to the playoffs for now!
I am sure you would. Who was your favorite player from those teams?
I loved Thurman Thomas and Bruce Smith. Those guys were just tough as nails.
I always thought Bruce Smith was the heart of those teams.
Yea, he was a great player for sure. There were some great talent on those teams.
Maybe if it were not for another guy with the last name of Smith, things could have worked out differently.
I think you are talking about Emmitt Smith?
I sure am! The best running back of all time in my opinion.
