Have you seen Rougue One yet?
Yes!  That was maybe in my top three Star Wars movies.
Yeah, it was terrifying to see what the Empire really could do.
I'm also glad they explained the whole part about why the Death Star was so vulnerable.
The best part of the movie though, when Vader cut down all those rebels.
Yes!  That was amazing, back to the roots of Vader being an unstoppable force.
The way he just threw them around, and deflected beams with this hand and force powers.  I've never seen anything like that.
Exactly what a villain should be.  Vader is just plane scary.
And it sounds morbid, but I like the fact everyone died.
No not at all, I know what you mean.  It added realism and depth to the entire franchise.
