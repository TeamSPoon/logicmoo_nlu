Who do you think is going to represent the NFC in the super bowl?
Well Atlanta looked pretty good last year and I don't see them getting any worse.
How about the Cowboys?
With Dak Prescott and Elliot there you can never count them out.
I never saw two rookies come in and make such a big impact right away.
Plus they have a really good o-line.
The Packers should be in the mix as well.
Well when you have Aaron Rodgers you can never count them out.
Did they finally get a running back?
They had Montgomery last year, he was pretty good.
Yeah but he was a wide receiver for a while first.
He didn't do that bad with his switch, plus they drafted a few new backs.
Seattle should still be pretty good too.
Yeah they have a lot of the pieces, but that defense isn't what it used to be.
Well any of those teams could win one game.
I know it should be really interesting to see who gets the BYEs in the playoffs.
Yeah homefield advantage is huge.
I wouldn't want my team going to Lambeau in January.
Yeah for sure, the cold is a really big factor.
Yeah for sure, the regular season is going to be important for all those teams.
