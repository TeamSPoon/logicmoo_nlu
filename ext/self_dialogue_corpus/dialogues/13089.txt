You know who I wish was still in the Star Wars movies?
Who?
Boba Fett! He was always my favorite as a child. I was so bummed out when he got eaten by the Sarlacc Pit in "Return of the Jedi."
Oh yeah, he was everyone's favorite back then I think. Such a cool character, even though he wasn't exactly a good guy.
No, he wasn't, but I always found the bounty hunter characters pretty fascinating.
How so?
Well, they were such gray characters. They weren't Sith but they weren't rebels either. They acted only on what would give them the most benefit, and money of course.
Yeah, getting Han Solo to Jabba the Hutt was a huge achievement for Boba Fett.
Yeah, he got the biggest bounty of his career and then died in the same movie, what a bad stroke of luck!
You can say that again!
