The Mighty Ducks made me want to play hockey
same here! I did play hockey in middle school
what type? was it ice hockey or floor hockey
I played floor hockey, I have also played ice hockey, it is fun
I liked how the team did so well but started out rough
so did I , they really worked hard for what they got
hockey is a rough sport though, lots of injuries
remember that big kid on their team?
Yes, he was in charge of knocking people over
I need to watch that movie again soon !
