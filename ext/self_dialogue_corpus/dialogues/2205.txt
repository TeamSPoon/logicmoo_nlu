Did you catch the practice footage for the upcoming game?
I already bought more sports channels.
Dude, why are you always hating on Manning?
Do you think he'll get in the Hall of Fame this year.
EJ is playing with some real vets.
I absolutely agree. How long is Manning out?
I think he's coming back for the 5th game.
Brady is not too far down on that list.
Did he talk about his injuries at all?
He only mentioned his workout routine.
So, Smith didn't press him.
How long as their current coach been in Chicago.
He's young enough to bounce back on another team.
Geno may get less now, but he's on a better team.
All of the NFL is quick to get rid of coaches.
I didn't even know their contracts were up.
Cam Newton stood out more to me than Roethlisberger ever did.
Fantasy football doesn't win Superbowls. Players would kill to get a ring.
If he keeps starting he'll be noticeable enough for future drafts.
Exactly, if he got drafted I can see him excelling past Brady.
