Do you prefer the early Beatles or later Beatles?
I prefer the later music, especially the psychedelic stuff like Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds.
Yes, that's a great one. I like Strawberry Fields myself.
Oh, I forgot about that. Yellow Submarine too.
Overall, though, I tend to prefer the energy of the early songs.
Which ones are your favorites?
She Loves You and I Want to Hold Your Hand. Have you seen any of their movies?
No. Should I?
Yes, Hard Day's Night and Help! are definitely worth checking out.
Okay, I'll do that. Thanks.
