Are you going to see Wonder Woman?
I'm not sure yet.  it looks good though.
Yeah.  I'm not sure either.
The action looks good, but the plot seems a little confusing.
Well, they follow the comics a little, but he to change it to work with the other dc movies.
Isn't the guy from the new Star Trek movies in it?
Yes, he is.
Chris Evans?
No, its Chris Pine.
Oh.  I like that guy.
Yeah.  He was very good as captain Kirk.
I saw him on SNL recently.
Me too.  It was very funny.
I guess I'll go see Wonder Woman.
When do you want to go see it?
Probably opening weekend.
I'll go see it with you.
What time?
Let's shoot for around 7pm.
Ok.  Let's plan for that then.
