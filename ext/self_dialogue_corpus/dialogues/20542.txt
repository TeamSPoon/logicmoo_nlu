Did you see Manchester by the Sea this year?
Yes, I didn't go to the movies to see it though.
Yeah, me neither. I watched it at home.
I don't think it needs to be seen at the theater.
So what did you think about it?
I liked it, but I didn't love it.
I agree. For all the hype that it was getting, I expected a lot.
Yes, I would have preferred to just see it without hearing the reviews first.
Did you find it incredibly depressing?
Well it was sad, but not as depressing as I heard it was.
Yes, I thought that it was going to be tough to get through.
Exactly. I found myself able to still enjoy the movie without being hammered with sadness.
So do you agree that Casey Affleck deserved the Best Actor Oscar for it?
He was good, but I've seen him as a good actor for a long time.
Yes, he could have gotten the award for a lot of other roles he played.
It seems like that is a common practice. The Oscars always wait to give someone the award, and try to make up for past mistakes.
Yeah just like Martin Scorsese. He directed like ten great movies before they gave him his Oscar.
Yes, that example came to my mind as well.
It probably all has to do with money and politics, and that makes me not want to watch the Oscars anymore.
I agree. It kind of ruins the magic of the movies to think of all the money-makers behind the scenes.
