I love the new Despacito song featuring Justin Beiber!
I agree!  He was surprisingly good at speaking in Spanish.
I heard that he won't perform the song in public anymore.
Why is that?
He tried to once and couldn't remember the words so he started making up fake Spanish words.
Ouch, that is pretty embarrassing!
I'm pretty sure he got booed off of the stage.
I wouldn't sing it in public again either if that happened to me.
I still think he is great in the song though.
Me too! It's one of my favorites right now!
