What movie do you think did not really need a sequel?
There are a lot that got a sequel any way.
Which one would be at the top of the list for no sequel needed?
I would say Jaws.
Really? Jaws Two had a lot going on.
That is the issue.
Why, it already told all it needed to.
Right, there was nothing left to tell it just went in to like silly stuff.
Like the shark beating the plane to the Bahamas.
Yes, then the shark exploding like a grape.
I think people were just wanting to see the suspense again.
Maybe people just liked boats too much.
That reminds me of Speed Two.
They made a Speed Two?
Yes, only this time it was with boats.
Wow, that was not needed.
It was the same premise, just on boats.
Did it have the same actors?
Not really. Not unlike the Mask, Son of The Mask.
With Jamie Kennedy, that one was awful.
