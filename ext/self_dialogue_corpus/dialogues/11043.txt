Did you watch the Penguins game last night?
Yes, I did watch it.
I hope the rest of this series isn't like this; although I would be happy if they won if every game is like this.
I hear what you mean. That was some brutal hockey.
I think Ottawa is playing some sort of 1-3-1 defense.
I heard that it was the trap.
I don't think it's the same kind of trap that the New Jersey Devils implemented years ago.
They don't have the players the Devils have.
They need to attack this defense another way.
And don't forget, Fleury has to continue to play out of his mind.
Yes, Fleury has been outstanding.
Especially with all of the injuries.
Don't remind me of the injuries.
I've never seen a team with so many injuries in my life.
They are practically down to 5 defensemen.
Hopefully Daley comes back tomorrow. Have you heard any news about him.
Haven't heard anything. I think they will bring Streit up to fill Schultz's place.
Yes, most definitely it will be Streit.
If only we had LeTang.
If only.
