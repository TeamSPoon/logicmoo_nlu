Samuel L Jackson is a phenomenal actor.
Yes, in this movie, he plays a villain, unbeknownst to Bruce Willis's character, the hero.

One of Bruce Willis's gifts in this movie is that he does not ever get sick, or has never even broken a bone.

In the opening of the movie, he is shown as a survivor of a terrible accident, and he is the lone survivor in the train.
So they call him Unbreakable.
