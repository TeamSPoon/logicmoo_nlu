I need to hear some new music.
Have you heard of Pearl Jam?
No, what are they like?
They are a grunge band.
That sounds cool. Who is the lead singer?
Eddie Veder. He is a great singer.
Are they similar to any bands I know?
Do you know about Alice In Chains?
Yes I do. I love them.
I would check them out then. They are very similar bands.
