Did you know they released Cars 3 recently?
Wow, I can't believe they made another Cars movie!
I agree. Too many sequels can be annoying.
It can never compare the to original either.
The first one was so great on its own, so I couldn't agree more.
I wonder what they wrote this one about?
Supposedly Lightning McQueen loses to a new racer and he has to fight his way back to the top.
It just seems like a repeat of past movies.
It does. I'm sure it's okay, but they should leave it alone after this.
I probably won't end up seeing it.
