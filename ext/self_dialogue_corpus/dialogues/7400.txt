I like this new trend of taking animated Disney movies and making them into live action movies.
Me, too. I trust Disney to do it right.
I know what you mean. Not everyone can be trusted.
I have seen too many studios try to redo my favorite childhood movies and bomb.
Yeah, and it kills a bit of my childhood when that happens!
I hear you.
Cinderella the animated one, was a huge part of my childhood.
Now that's a live action movie.
Great cast, too.The king is played by Derek Jacobi, a noted Shakespearean actor.
Yep, Disney sure does it right.
