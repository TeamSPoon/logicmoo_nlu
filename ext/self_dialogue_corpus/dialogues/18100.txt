Hey, you know a lot about pop music, right?
Yes, I suppose.
Who is this Lindsey Sterling I keep hearing about?
She is a violinist who sequed a youtube video career into live tours.
So she's a classical violinist, or what's the story?
No, she does recreations of pop tunes on the violin, and her own tunes. I think she got famous for doing a medley of Legend of Zelda songs.
Tell me more.
So she puts on costumes and dances around and kicks while playing the violin.
Now I'm starting to get it.
And it doesn't hurt that she's tiny and cute.
And she does some of her own stuff, too?
Yeah, she has a steampunk/cowboy video with lots of country-style dancing that has millions of views.
What's it called?
Roundtable roundup or something like that.
Is it any good?
I have to admit I like it.
So she did these youtube videos and now she's a bonafide recording artist?
Yeah, she has a live tour that's sponsored by youtube, I think. If I remember, she was on America's got talent or some show like that.
I may have to check out one of her videos.
Just type her name in youtube.
