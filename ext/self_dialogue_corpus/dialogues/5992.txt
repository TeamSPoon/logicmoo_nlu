Wasn't Zootopia hilarious?
It was so good! Not one false note.
Jason Bateman was perfect as the fox.
Yeah, shades of Arrested Development there.
And the little rabbit policewoman. Too funny!
She was cute. And effective.
Don't think they had a lot by way of music going on.
Just the comedy.
Wonder who wrote it.
Well its definitely a keeper.
