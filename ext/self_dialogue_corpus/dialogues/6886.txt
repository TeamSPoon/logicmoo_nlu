I just saw the new Beauty and the Beast!
Wasn't it amazing??
Yes, I wanted to sing along the whole time.
I know, the music was even better than the cartoon.
The costumes really blew me away.
Yeah, Belle looked so beautiful at the end!
My kids got a little scared during the fight scene.
Wasn't it intense? I cried.
I am definitely going to buy the DVD.
Me, too. I'm sure we will play it on repeat!
