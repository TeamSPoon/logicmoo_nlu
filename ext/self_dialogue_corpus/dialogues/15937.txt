Do you listening to pop music at all?
Yes of course!
What artist?
I love Fifth Harmony.
I like them too but now they are only fourth harmony.
True but you cannot deny their talent.
I agree!
What songs do you like from them?
I like worth it.
Oh cool, I like work from home.
That is also a great song.
Everytime I hear them I feel so good.
They have the most catchy songs compared to most artists.
I also like Justin Beiber.
Oh seriously?
Yes I know. I like As Long as You Love Me.
That is actually kind of a cute song to be honest.
I know right?
Well it was a blast talking to you.
Agreed, until next time!
