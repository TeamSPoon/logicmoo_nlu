I always forget how much I love old Lady GAGA songs!
Me too!
It's like impossible not to dance to them!
I know what you mean, I love poker face.
Me too, and Telephone.
Oh, I forgot about that one!
Yeah, her and beyonce are amazing.
Yeah, I love the music video to that one too.
Yes, I love the style and the story!
Me too, it's one of my favorite music videos.
