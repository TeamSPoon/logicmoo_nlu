Pitch Perfect

No, it's a movie about choir groups.

Yes it was. the plot was pretty good, but the singing was incredible.
That's interesting. tell me more.
it follows 3 groups around as they compete nationally for awards.
Who is the headliner in the movie?
Her name was Anna Kendrick.
I haven't heard of her. Has she been in other movies?
she has been in a bunch! She was in up in the air. have you seen that one?
Yes I have. She is very attractive.
yes she is. Her personality in the movie makes her even more attractive

She really does have a good voice. I was surprised when I heard it.
