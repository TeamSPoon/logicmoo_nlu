Hey, I have the song Jar of Hearts stuck in my head!
Who sings that?
Christina Perri. Have you heard her sing?
It doesn't sound familiar.
Her voice is great. It is has a great range but it is more on the raspy side.
I will have to look her up.
Her voice sounds beautiful with just a guitar.
I love when artists can sing with minimal or no instruments.
I think she also sang on of the songs from the Twilight movie.
Oh yeah, I know who you are talking about.
My daughter loves to sing along with her.
That's cute. You all could do a duet!
We sing Jar of Hearts so loud when it comes on!
I'm sure the neighbors love that.
I would love to see her in concert.
Does she have any tours coming up?
Not sure. I don't think she has done anything new lately.
Maybe she is touring with someone.
I would still like to hear her perform live.
True, a lot of artists sound different live.
