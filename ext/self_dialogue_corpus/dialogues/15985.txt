What is your favorite genre of music?
Don't laugh at me okay?
I make no promises.
Okay, do you like Lute music at all?
Like the string instrument?
Precisely, the sounds it can make are absolutely mesmerizing.
I cannot say I'm familiar with the genre at all.
You've heard some versions of popular songs on it for sure.
Like what?
Have you ever heard Greensleeves?
I don't believe so.
Well it was remade into a holiday song, but the original was deeper.
Oh yea, I know which one you're talking about now, I had no idea that was a remake!
Sure is, and the thing is, nobody really knows what the original was intended to be about.
What do you mean?
Well listen to the lyrics, they weren't sure if it was about somebody in particular or a certain type of person.
Certain type of person?
Yea, to wear green sleeves back in the day meant something.
What did it mean?
That's not for me to tell you.
