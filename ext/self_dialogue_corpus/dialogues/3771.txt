Have you seen The Nice Guys?
Yes, Russell Crow is hilarious in it.
I agree. I loved his chemistry with the guy from the notebook!
Ryan Gosling?
Yes, I forgot his name for a minute.
Would you consider it a thriller movie though?
Yes, because it has moments of suspense.
I thought maybe it was a buddy cop movie.
Can't it be both?
You are right, it can be both.
