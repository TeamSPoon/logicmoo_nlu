HI, have you seen the newest Rock movie, Baywatch?
NO have you?
Not yet but I plan on it. I love the Rock, he is a great actor
I want to go see the new Guardians of the Galaxy.
Did you see the first one?
Yes and it was great. Love Groot. I hear he is a baby now in the new one
Yes thats what I heard too. might be interesting to go see.
I've been looking at the trailers for the new King Arthur movie.
Yeah I saw it too. Jude Law is a good actor
yes he is and I am considering that one.
Might be a good one to see. what do you think about the fate of the furious?
Oh I love the fast and furious movies but they might be a little overworked don't you think?
NO more then any of the other themes. I mean look at startrek movies.
Yeah and now they have the entire new set up for those.
What about the Aliens series? There is a new out there too.
I saw that. the trailer I mean. looks good.
I was thinking the same thing. Maybe I'll go see Covenant first.
Might be an idea. There are so many good ones out.
I see they have a new Pirates movie out
Yes. Priates of the caribean, dead men tell no tales. sort of misnomer if you ask me.
