Who do you think led the emo movement?
In what era?
Like the 90s basically towards the end.
I would say The Promise Ring.
I could agree with that, which album?
Very Emergency was the one that did it for me.
I loved that album!
I think it introduced the emotional side of the genre.
Yeah wasnt it more punk at the time?
Yes it was aggressive in nature for the most part.
Do they still make music?
No I think they just go ahead and tour every once in awhile.
What state are they from?
Wisconsin I believe.
They were very basic sounding
Yeah it was but that was the appeal of the genre.
And then it changed into bands like My Chemical Romance.
No I think that was when it got commercialized
So people put them in the wrong genre?
Yeah MCR was more rock
