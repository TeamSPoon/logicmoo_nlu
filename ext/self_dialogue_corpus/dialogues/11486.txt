Wow, I love this song!
Who is it?
It's by the Beatles! It's called "Something."
Is it by Paul or John?
It's actually by George!
I didn't know he wrote any of the songs.
Yes, actually Frank Sinatra said this was his favorite Lennon/McCartney song.
That's funny! I only know their early pop songs.
What's your favorite?
I love "Love Me Do!"
