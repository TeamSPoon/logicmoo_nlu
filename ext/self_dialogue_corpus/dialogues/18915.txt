What music artists are you into?
I'm a die hard Pearl Jam fan. You?
I'm a huge Taylor Swift fan, actually...
Oh wow, we couldn't be more different with our tastes!
Are you familiar with Taylor Swift?
Not really to be honest. I have heard her stuff before, but I don't know much about it.
Oh. I actually enjoy Pearl Jam. I know their songs, "Jeremy" and "Even Flow"
Those are great songs. They have a huge collection of hits. Do you have any albums of theirs?
No I don't. I'm guessing you do.
I have every single one, and I have seen them in concert multiple times. "No Code" and "Yield" are my favorites personally.
Are you into other rock bands?
I am. I like Nirvana, The Rolling Stones, Linkin Park, etc.
Oh I like Linkin Park, too. They're pretty good.
Chester Bennington is their lead singer, and his voice is out of this world.
Wasn't Mark Wakefield their lead singer?
He was, but only from 1996-1998. After that Chester Bennington took over.
Oh wow, I didn't know that to be honest.
Their music is great. "Numb" is one of my favorite songs.
That is a good song. I like "In the end"
That's a good one, too. Actually, all of their music is pretty awesome.
