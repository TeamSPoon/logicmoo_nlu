There's a Disney movie coming out in November I can't wait to see.
What is it?
Thor:Ragnorak with Chris Hemsworth. Apparently a lot of other people like me can't wait to see it.
Why? Are they all posting online or something?
They released a trailer of it, and the people who viewed the trailer in the first 24 hours broke the record for number of views in the first 24 hours for a Disney film.
Wow, people must really want to see it. What movie was the previous record holder?
Beauty and the Beast. It had 127 million views, and Thor had 136 million views.
I didn't think people would be that excited about a trailer for Thor.
It was because a bunch of the Marvel creators were boasting about how this was going to be the best trailer ever, and it got the fans really curious.
I wonder what the box office records will be when the film comes out in November?
