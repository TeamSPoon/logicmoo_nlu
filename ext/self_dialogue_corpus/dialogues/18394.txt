What station do you listen to on the radio?
I like to listen to our local rock and roll station.
That is what I listen to most of the time as well.
They play good music but it can get somewhat repetitive.
What song do you thin they repeat too often?
They play Alice and Chains a lot.
I am an Alice and Chains fan myself.
I like them too but they are overplayed on the local rock station.
I guess I would probably agree.
What is your favorite song the station plays.
I like when they mix it up and play some older rock and roll.
Like Ozzy?
Exactly.
What song do you like by him?
I like the song Crazy Train.
I like Crazy Train as well but it is not my favorite Ozzy song.
What is yours?
I really like No More Tears.
Very true, that is a great song.
It is in my top ten favorite rock songs.
