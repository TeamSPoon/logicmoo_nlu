Have you seen The return of the Jedi?
I did, about 20 years ago.
It is a great movie.
I think it was alright, but my favorite was the newest one, Rogue One.
Well the Return of the Jedi was well made.
I agree with you there, I like how they were in a forest for most of the movie.
Yeah it was different than the rest of the movies at the time.
I loved the little Ewoks that they introduced in the Return of the Jedi as well.
Those guys were so cute!
I don't think so, I was just happy they helped the rebellion defeat the emperor.
