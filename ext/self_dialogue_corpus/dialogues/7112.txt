do you know who your nose reminds me of?
this sounds offensive, but who?
Pinocchio from the disney movies
wow wasnt he the guy with the long nose?
yes, it would grow every time he lied
so you are saying my nose gets bigger when i lie?
no but you kinda look like him
well thanks for thinking i look like a puppet
dont take offense pinocchio just wanted to be a real boy
well i guess its pretty cool to be pinocchio cause he is famous
