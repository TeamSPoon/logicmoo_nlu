Can we talk about Kendrick Lamar's music?
Who? Kenny, K Dot, Mr. Lamar, Kendrick, of course we can!
I don't think I'm being hyperbolic when I say straight up that he is the best storyteller of our generation.
You're not being hyperbolic. I don't even know who would come close.
Vince Staples is a pretty good storyteller, but he's got a ways to come.
Yeah, you're right Vince Staples is good, but I think his newer stuff is veering away from storytelling a bit.
Right. Kendrick's storytelling is just unbelievable.
I know, good kid, m.A.A.d. city brings you into Kendrick's mind and out on the streets of Compton.
It feels so true, which of course I don't know if that's the case because I grew up in a totally different circumstance than Kendrick.
Same, I also grew up in an affluent middle class suburb, but I can't help but feel that it's authentic, that's what people who have shared his experience say.
That's amazing that it's authentic, but also can connect on such a broad level.
Yeah, good kid, maad city is a special album. I love how weird it sounds.
Yeah, Kendrick switching voices, getting pitchy, slowing his voice down, sing-speaking, etc., is all risky, but he pulls it off.
We have to talk about the sequencing too.
Yeah, the sequencing totally changes the meaning of his tracks.
For example, Backseat Freestyle on its own sounds like a crazy boast. Pretty standard for hip-hop.
Right, and then it's followed by "The Art of Peer Pressure" which is super introspective, about not knowing who one is, about regretting stupid things one has done, about being vulnerable.
It's crazy. His sequencing is absurdly good, I don't think people appreciate it enough.
DAMN. is another great example of this. You can play it forward and then play it backwards and the meaning changes.
Did we ever get word from Kendrick himself on whether that was intentional? Either way, I love the effect of reversing it.
