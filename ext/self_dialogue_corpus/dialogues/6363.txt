Hey, the kids want to watch Moana.
We just watched it yesterday and this morning.
Well they really like it. Put it on?
I suppose so. It's not the worst one to watch over and over.
You know it's cute and the kids love it.
Yeah I know. I probably know every line verbatim.
What can I say except you're welcome!
I'd rather be shiny! Love that crab song.
Yeah me too. It is one of the cooler parts of the movie.
I think they did a really great job with the tribute to Bowie there.
