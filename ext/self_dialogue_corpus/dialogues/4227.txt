Have you seen the movie "Double Jeopardy?"
No, I haven't.  What is it?
It's one of my favorite thriller movies.  It stars Ashley Judd.
I like Ashley Judd.  I haven't seen her in much lately.
Me too.  In this movie, she plays a woman whose husband sets her up for his murder, and she goes to jail.
That sounds really interesting.  Tell me more.
When she finds out that he is still alive, she sets out to kill him because she can't be convicted twice for the same crime.
That sounds exciting.  I guess that's where the title "Double Jeopardy" comes into play.
Yes, it is.  Tommy Lee Jones also stars as a federal marshall who is trying to track down the Ashley Judd character. It is a really exciting movie.
It sounds really good.  I will have to check it out.  Tommy Lee Jones is one of my favorite actors.
