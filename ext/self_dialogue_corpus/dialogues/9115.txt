Are you at all a fan of Metallica's self-titled album?
That's the one they call the black album, right?
That's the one. I've been told that a lot of metal fans don't like it much.
That's understandable, considering that the band went from thrash metal to more straightforward hard rock on the album.
So you don't like it?
Actually, I do. I respect Metallica for taking such a bold risk.
That was unexpected. Do you like all of their more rock-oriented albums?
Honestly, I am. Like I said, I appreciated them for the risks that they took.
But what's your opinion on the music itself?
I really like it. Can't go wrong with a little variety.
