I just watched Mad Max Fury road.
How was it?
Well, it was non stop action from beginning to end.
Sounds like a good movie.
Yes it was.  Then I wanted to watch the original so i did.  Mel Gibson looked really young.
He was in the first ones.
The same director who directed road warrior directed Fury Road.
Were the styles similar?
Oh yes, and there were lots of easter eggs
I will look for them when I watch it.
