Do you have a favorite Blues/Rock cross-over musician?
That's easy -- Steve Winwood, by far.
That's a good pick. I liked his stuff in the 70's
His early stuff was incredible. The backup work he did with Muddy Waters,B.B. King and Chuck Berry.
I'm more familiar with "Hold On." That was one of my favorite songs in Jr. High.
Yeah, his later solo stuff was really good too. Personally, I liked "While You see a Chance You Take It" myself.
The Arc of a Diver LP was awesome! I think he did pretty much everything on that -- keyboards, guitar, percussion and even the background vocals.
That's why he's my favorite.
He's British and he's a Blues legend, that's pretty unique.
And look at all of the labels he's been signed with: Columbia, Virgin, Island
But he hasn't done much lately.
That depends on how you define "lately." Live from Madison Garden was about 8 years ago.
That was with Eric Clapton... another great.
That opened at  #12 on the Billboard Top 100.
I heard that he had a Phd. When did he have the time for all of that studying?
That was an honorary degree from Berklee College of Music. He didn't actually go to school for that.
He won a couple of Grammy's in the 80's.
That was in 1986 for best male vocals and album of the year for Back in the High Life
I guess maybe I should try and listen to more of his early stuff.
His more recent work is awesome too. If you haven't already and you get a chance check out "Nine Lives."
