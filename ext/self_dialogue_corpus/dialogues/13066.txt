What did you like most about Star Wars movies?
I've seen them all and I think I like the story of young Anakin the most.
That's from Star Wars Episode I right?
Yes.  It's the fourth movie but the beginning of the series as a whole.
I remember, that's the movie with the speed pod racing.
Right.  And Anakin is the pilot of the winning pod, but I just like seeing him when he's young before he becomes Darth Vader.
I never thought of it like that.  Darth Vader was certainly a very menacing person.
I agree, that's why it was nice to see him as a young and innocent child.
Looking back, it didn't take long for him to lose that innocence either.  By Episode II he was already showing his dark side.
Definitely.  You can already see the Darth Vader in him by that point.
