What's your favorite Aerosmith song?
I like Big 10 Inch record.
That's a fun one. I like Walk This Way.
Steven Tyler has such a cool voice.
He does and I like how unique his sound is.
He has really aged well.
I know he has. He still looks really young.
Not only that, but his vocals are still good.
Not bad for a guy who is 69.
He's been lucky.
