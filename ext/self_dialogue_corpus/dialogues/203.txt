Which X-men movie was your favorite?
Logan, for sure.
You're just saying that because it's the most recent.
Not true. The whole franchise IS Wolverine, and this was the last movie with him and gave him a good death.
The time frame was weird though. It was only like fifteen years and every mutant is dead or dying.
True, but maybe that's just a genetic defect: the modern era only saw mutants emerge in world war 2.
I liked X-Men 2 the most.
Why is that?
It's the highest rated, so there's that. Also, I'm religious, and they had a christian character! That never happens in these movies.
That's true, religion does take a backseat. It's definitely a top movie, despite the religion that I don't like.
