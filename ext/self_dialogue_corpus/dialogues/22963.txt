Guess what I watched last night?
What?
Sin City!  It's an incredible movie, you have got to see it.
I've never even heard of it.  Can you tell me a little about it?
Yeah, it came out in 2005.  It's a Frank Miller and Robert Rodriguez movie.
Oh they were the producers? You've got my attention now!
Yeah, they make great movies.
Who starred in it?
Jessica Alba, Mickey Rourke, Bruce Willis, and many others.  It had a great cast.
Oh wow.  So what's the movie about?
It's kinda like a graphic novel.  It tells the story of several different characters and the stories overlap.
What do you mean it's like a graphic novel?
It's depicted like a graphic novel, almost like a dark comic book.  The images seem that way and the characters do too.
So it's not something that could actually happen?
No, they have like superhero powers.  But it's beautiful the way it's laid out.
It sounds like it could look cool.  Is the plot good?
Yeah there are several storylines that are running throughout the movie.
What's the main story?
It's about corruption in Basin City, which is where it's set.
It sounds interesting, I think I will have to check it out!
