Do you remember the firework scene in Harry Potter Order of the Phoenix?
Yes I do, why?
I was just thinking about fireworks and the part where Fred and George came to mind.
That's such a good part.
Yeah it is especially when they started shooting fireworks everywhere and made Ron, Harry and Hermoine laugh.
Weren't some people scared too?
Yes, Draco, Crabbe and Umbridge I think.
That's right I remember her running in terror.
Yeah that was a funny part, they're just fireworks.
I know right.
