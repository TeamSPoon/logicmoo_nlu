Have you seen Split yet?
Is that the movie about the guy with multiple personalities?
Yeah, he's got twenty something personalities
Is it scary?
There are parts that are definitely tense, but nothing too bad
So does one guy play all of the personalities or how does that work?
Yeah, it's all James McAvoy
He's able to pull that off?
Yeah, it's actually really impressive how he makes them work
I'll have to check it out, who directed it?
M Night Shyamalan
Eh, maybe not then. I don't really like his recent stuff
Like what?
Well he completed ruined the Avatar movie
The one with the blue people? I loved that movie
No not that one, The Last Airbender
Oh right, I try to forget that movie was made.
Yeah, you can't really fit 60 episodes of a TV show into one movie
Yeah, that was definitely a failed project for him, I think you'd really like Split though
I guess I'll have to watch it and see
