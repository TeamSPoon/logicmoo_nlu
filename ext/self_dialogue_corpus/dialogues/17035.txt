Did you ever watch The Monkees when you were a kid?
That's really old. Did you really like them?
I thought they were the greatest in junior high school.
Is that the group where none of the them played their own instruments?
From what I understand, only one could play when they started the show.
Did they at least sing their own songs?
Yes, they always did their own singing. They started playing instruments later.
What was the show about?
It was copying the Beatles' Hard Days Night movie. It was just nonsense mostly.
Why did you like the show so much?
The song were really catchy and I liked some of the people a lot.
Would I know any of their songs?
I'm sure you would. They did Daydream Believer and I'm a Believer, to name two.
I'm a Believer, like from Shrek?
Yes, same song but song by other people.
Did they write that song, or any of their songs?
I don't know if they wrote that one but I know they wrote some of the them.
Did they all write?
I think only one or two wrote songs.
What are they doing now?
