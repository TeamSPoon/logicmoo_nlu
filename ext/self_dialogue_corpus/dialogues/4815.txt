Did you watch the baseball game?
Yes it was exciting
I thought it was a little dull
Why would you think that?
The game was very one-sided
Yes, only one team scored points
It would be more exciting if it was a closer game
I agree
Perhaps the next game will be better
I agree
Who will be playing next time?
I believe it is the team's rival
Oh I think that will be a better game
I agree!
When will that be?
I believe next week
Will you be watching it?
Yes, I will. Will you be watching it?
Yes, I will.
See you then!
