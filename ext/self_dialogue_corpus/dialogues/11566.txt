I miss when music was as good as it was when the Beatles were making music.
You like the Beatles too? I love their music.
Yeah, I mean songs like Come Together and All You need is Love just don't happen anymore.
I agree. Those were timeless songs.
They were really were. All of their music was just so powerful.
True. It really spoke to the people about world issues and brought people together.
And it still does. Their music is still relevant.
Absolutely. We can still watch Paul McCartney sing a few songs every now and then.
Yea, true but its not the same. I just loved music that the Beatles made together.
Same. It never gets old.
