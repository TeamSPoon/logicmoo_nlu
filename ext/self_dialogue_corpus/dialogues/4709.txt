Did you know the a baseball had 88 stitches on it.
No I didn't know that.
That's a piece of baseball knowledge.
So why 88?
I really don't know why, but it's 88.
I noticed that it's always red stitching.
Yeah, so that the player can see the ball better.
That makes sense.
Also, did you know they cover the ball in mud.
No they don't.
Yes they do.
Why?
It's so that the ball dosent slip out of their hand.
Did you have a pro ball?
Yup,I have 2
Can you rub the dirt off?
I sure I can, but why.
Just skiing
Want to hold it?
Sure
