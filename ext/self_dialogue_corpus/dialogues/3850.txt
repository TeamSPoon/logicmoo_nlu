I am in the mood to see a movie tonight!
Me too. How do you feel about seeing a thriller movie?
I love thriller movies. The last one that I saw was Don't Breathe.
I don't think that I ever saw that one. Did you like it?
It was alright. I would not watch it again.
Well, The Mummy is playing in theaters now. How do you feel about seeing that?
I love the Mummy movies! I did not know a new one was out.
This one is starring Tom Cruise. I don't think it has any of the old cast members.
Anything with Tom Cruise is good.
Agreed! What time do you want to see it tonight?
