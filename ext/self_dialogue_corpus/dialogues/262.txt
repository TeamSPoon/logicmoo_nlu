What do you think Spiderman evolves into?
Nothing more than just its movies and the adaptations.
Can you see it eventually getting to college age like they had done it?
Yeah he probably has to do 3 movies so they can flash forward to it.
I dont know if they need to
Yeah they could keep him around forever
You never know with the way the universe is going.
They are handling it well.
How so?
The movies are intertwining with one another.
