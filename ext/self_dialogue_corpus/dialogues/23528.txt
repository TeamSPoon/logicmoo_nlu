have you seen the spongebob movie?
yes i have seen it
Its probably my favorite movie
yes its very good and very popular
Thats so true, i think everyone has watched it
well whats better than a sponge driving a krabby patty
true, no other movie would have that.
thats why its so good
yes its so unique and just plain random
Absolutely! do you think the show is good too
i think the show is okay but could be different
how so?
they could make it a little more funny and appealing
i agree it seems very random.
Well thank you for talking with me
no thank you it was very interesting
and spongbob was a great topic to choose!
i agree 100%!
Have a great day
you too
