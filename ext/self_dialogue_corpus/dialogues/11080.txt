Those sunglasses the rapper Pitbull made famous are still popular. It's amazing.
It sure is, I see them everywhere I go. But I saw them on Amber Heard first.
Did you really? Everybody calls them "Pitbulls."
I  know that. That's because he wore them first?
Yeah, and at one time he endorsed them.
You mean he doesn't any more?
No, he definitely doesn't. He's fighting with the company that produces them.
So he's wearing some other kind?
I guess so.
I wonder if people will wear the ones he used to wear because of the publicity, or his new pick.
Because of that publicity, you mean.
Well, people always want to wear the newest thing.
That's true. The latest style is what they want.
So you're supposed to constantly update your look.
Sure. To show that you know what's going on in the world.
Well, I guess I don't. I wouldn't even recognize Pitbull.
But you'd recognize his sunglasses.
Yep. And I'd wear them, too.
Well, that's fashion.
Yes it is.
