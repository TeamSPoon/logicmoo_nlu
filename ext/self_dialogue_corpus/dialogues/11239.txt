Have you seen the Jennifer Lawrence Dior handbag ad?
I'm not sure. Is that the one where she is wearing a white sweater?
Finally. Someone who also thinks her outfit was weird.
Baby, you are not the only one. What was that anyway?
While she is hanging it over the back of a white sofa. Yes that's the one.
I just love that black bag!
So do I, but my purse doesn't.
Tell me about. Designer prices are getting out of hand.
That small red bag she was holding in another ad has my name all over it.
The one in which she is wearing a pink sweater and that white coat?
Those outfits she was wearing in those ads are stunning.
Yeah, she can make dirt look good.
Did you notice that big bracelet she had on?
Yeah. I was wondering if it was real.
With all the money she makes, I bet it is.
I guess. It sure was big enough in any case.
What did you think of the sleeves on that shirt/ dress?
The kinda reminded me of bell bottoms.  I liked them.
I'm trying to remember if she was wearing any other jewelry in that ad.
I don't think she was. I just remember that huge gold looking bracelet.
