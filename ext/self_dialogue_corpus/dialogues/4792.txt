This kid Aaron judge is good. have you seen him?
No, who is that? who does play for?
the yankees! nothing like in the 90s though
he's a rookie then? when did he start?
This year dumbass! obviously if he's a rookie he started this year.
I'm sorry, I don't know too much about baseball, I'm only really thinking about networking
Fun times. anyway back to the Yankees. He's a right fielder, he smacks homers
how good is he? like is he powerful?
When he hits homers he knocks it into the restaurant outside. I'm not even playing.
is he a big dude? like tall?
Oh my god this dude is huge! he's like six foot seven
he hits a homer and they say "here comes the judge"
wow you must be talking about 400-500 foot home runs! is he a MVP?
He made rookie of the month. He has also has made most valuable player in some games recently.
the Yankees have a new young nucleus, a new young team they can build around
like jeter and them? some new young stars?
yeah, exactly like that! this is just what they need
they have been a little weak lately, so I'm glad to see this
hold on, don't disrespect the Yankees. I won't have that
I forget you are a true fan. My apologies to your people.
