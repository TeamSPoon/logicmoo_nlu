I think that Joe Dante might be one of the most underrated directors out there.
I don't know who that is off the top of my head.
Just goes to show what I'm talking about. He directed Gremlins!
Oh. I thought Gremlins was a Spielberg film?
In a way it was. He executive produced it, and his production company made it, but it was a Joe Dante film.
I guess that explains why I associated it with him.
Dante also directed the sequel, which is brilliant in its own right.
The sequel is so weird compared to the original!
That's kind of the point. He knew he couldn't top the first one, so he decided to take it in a different direction.
That's pretty smart, actually.
He also did Matinee. Have you seen that?
I've never heard of it.
It stars John Goodman, and it's about a filmmaker in the 1960s who wants to use the fear of the Cold War to make his new horror film the scariest ever.
Is it a horror film?
It's a comedy. It's kind of different, but it's pretty funny.
It sounds like he makes a lot of pretty different kinds of comedies.
That's true, he also did Small Soldiers, for example.
Now that I have seen! That is another weird comedy!
It is, but like all of his movies, it's pretty great.
You know what? I think you're right, he is pretty underrated!
