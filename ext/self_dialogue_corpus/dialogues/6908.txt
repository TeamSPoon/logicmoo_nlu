Did you ever see that movie Ratatouille?
I saw that in the theatres, actually. It's been a while.
Here's a question for you, then. Who was Ratatouille?
Trick question! Ratatouille referred to the prepared dish and bistro in the movie.
Exactly. It was not the name of the rat, as a lot of people seem to think.
Yep. The rat's name was Remy.
Something funny about that movie is the fact that we're all supposed to overlook the fact that someone has a rat hanging out on top of their head. Gross!
That's right. I remember the rat would control the cooking while hiding under the chef's hat.
Patton Oswalt did the voice of Remy, by the way.
Cool. I wonder if there were any other famous actors in that movie.
