Hey, have you seen the new Fast and Furious movie?
No, is it any good?
Not really, it is just more odd than anything else.
What do you mean odd?
Well, Vin Diesel in now a bad guy.
Really, how did that happen.
Well, I don't want to ruin the movie for you, but he has his reasons I guess.
Well, yeah, I probably will watch it eventually, so thanks for not spoiling it.
That's no problem, but it's weird in other ways as well.
How so?
Well Paul Walker is not in it, and he kind of was part of that to me.
Yeah, his passing was really sad, I hated to hear it.
So did I, I think they really should have quit making these movies without him.
Well I kind of feel that way as well.
You just keep expecting him to pop in the movie and he is still alive.
I can understand that, I mean they keep killing people in those movies and just bringing them back.
Yeah, what is up with that.
I do not know, but it really is annoying.
Anyway, it is a okay movie, you should go see it.
I will I suppose, when I find the time.
