what type of music do you like to listen to?
I like rap music, as well as a little country from time to time.
Those two usually do not go together for most people.
I know, my mom used to love country and my brother always listened to rap.
So you got a little of both of their styles, right?
I think so! what about you, what kind of music do you like?
I love Tim McGraw and Keith Whitley.
I know a lot about the both of them. My mom met Keith Whitley a long time ago.
Wow that would have been a really neat experience. I bet she will always treasure that moment!
She does, she always talks about how polite and kind that he was.
Me and my brother always loved that song Brotherly Love by him, because it reminded us of each other.
Yea I remember my mom playing that song over and over.
I think me and your mom would get along great!
Probably! Have you ever listened to any type of rap music?
My son used to really like Eminem. So I did hear some of his material.
Did you like it at all?
There was one song that I heard from him, I think it was called Lighters that was not that bad.
Yea that is a song he did with Bruno Mars. I enjoy that song myself.
I do not care for a lot of his other songs that I have heard though.
I understand, maybe one day you will run in to another one of his songs that you like.
