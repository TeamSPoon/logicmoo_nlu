One of my favorite groups of all time are The Beatles.
They are the best ever.
I can't think of any songs by them that I don't completely love.
I don't know which is my favorite.
I really like the more pop-like songs like Yellow Submarine.
Me too!
But I also really like the ones that are more like Come Together.
What a great song!
It has a different sound but I really dig it.
Oh yeah!
