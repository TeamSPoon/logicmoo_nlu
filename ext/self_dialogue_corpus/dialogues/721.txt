How do you think the Carolina Panthers will do this year?
Fairly decent.  I doubt they will return to the Super Bowl again.
How important is Cam Newton to the team?
He is very important.  He needs to cut down on turnovers and mistakes.
What about his receivers?
They are fair.  His best passing option is going to his tight end Greg Olsen.
Do you think the rookies will help out?
They should. Christian McCaffrey should help at back and receiver.  He seems really fast.
Yes he seems like he could play multiple positions.
Exactly.  Also with Cam Newton being so mobile they might run the option at times.
You think the option would work?
It doesn't seem to at times in the NFL. Miami tried it some in the past.
Yes, they had hit and miss success with the wildcat system.
However, I think Cam Newton is a bigger and faster player than what other teams have had when using it.
What about the Panthers defense?
I think Luke Kuechly is definitely the best or one of the best linebackers in the league.
Yes he definitely covers a lot of ground on defense.
Everything centers around his play. However he needs help in the secondary.
If the secondary plays well do you think they can return to the Super Bowl?
Probably not.  When they went to the Super Bowl two years ago I think they were just having really good luck in a lot of games.
