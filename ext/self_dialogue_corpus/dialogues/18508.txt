Did you ever listen to Sam Smith?
Sam who?
Sam Smith, he won a Grammy back in 2015 for Stay With Me
Nope, never heard of him. Who else was nominate that year?
I remember Beyonce and Meghan Trainor off the top of my head.
Did Meghan Trainor sing All About That Bass?
Yes, that's the one.
Was fun to listen to that song the first three times, but then it was really annoying after that.
Yeah, agree.
Oh wait, didn't Beck win something that year?
Yeah, he won for Best Album for Morning Phase
Yeah, and then someone got up on the stage because Beyonce didn't win.
I don't remember that one.
Yeah, it was pretty embarrassing.
Whatever happened to Sam Smith?
Not sure, I haven't heard of any of his works recently.
Interesting sometimes people just fall off all of the sudden.
Yeah, it's called a one hit wonder.
But he had more than one hit
Well, he only has one hit album.
