East Coast or West Coast? Who you got?
I really don't care about which coast or where you came from. I just like cool music.
I'm with you. The rap coast war was very destructive to the genre and the community.
I was a Biggie and Public Enemy fan back in the day, and a fan of 2 Pac and NWA.
Me too, I liked groups and artists on both sides of the country. I never had a bias towards one or the other.
Groups like Outkast and guys like Eminem kind of dissolved that beef didn't they?
What about Kid Rock? He was a Detroit kid and I heard his first album in the early 90's.
He's been around for a lot longer than people realize hasn't he?
Yup, and he's still doing his thing today and he does different styles of music.
I think it would be cool if Eminem did like a southern rock song thing. It would blow people away.
