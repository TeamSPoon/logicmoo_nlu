Can you believe we used to get scared at movies like Halloween and Carrie?
I know. It seems so ridiculous now.
When I flip through the channels and see one of those old ones on, I just laugh at the thought of ever being scared of one of those films.
I remember growing up watching, The Birds.
Oh gosh, me too. I haven't seen it in years.
It terrified me. I couldn't stand the scene where the birds are flying at them and they're trying to run away.
I bet if we watched it today, it wouldn't be nearly as scary as it was then.
I'm sure you're right.
I haven't seen any recent thriller movies. They all look really dumb to me.
That's probably what our parents said back when we were kids about the ones we went to see.
