Have you heard of any good Jazz music lately?
Jazz?  I thought they were a basketball team.
You're a riot.
Seriously though, no, don't listen to it.
I started to get into it after I saw Whiplash.
And how's that working for you?
Pretty good.  I really enjoy the beat.
I didn't think jazz had a beat.
Oh, it certainly does.  You're not listening to it enough.
So if I was going to listen to jazz, where would I start?
Do you want some oldies?
Sure!
Miles Davis and John Coltrane are a good start.
Aren't they from a long, long time ago?
They're deceased if that's what you mean.
I was hoping for some newer artists.
You should check out Gregory Porter.  He's the real deal.
Interesting.  I'll give it a shot.
I guarantee you'll be a fan.
I hope so.  I'd like to expand my tastes!
