Do you think they should havr given Darth Maul more lines in The Phantom Menace.
Of course. He had a cool voice.
They killed him off way too early.
I agree. There was a lot of potential there.
Did you like his costume?
The black robe was perfect.
What about the horns?
The horns were a bit too much for me.
I wonder why they killed him.
I have no clue.
