I can't stand the league.
What about them?
The latest rule changes, right?
No?
Yeah.
I like them.
They're really good at ruining fast play.
I mean, they make the game complex.
They're not good rules.
They're absurdly good rules.
They're like absolute terror.
I love them, to be honest.
No way.
I mean, yeah.
Come on.
All the games were the same.
They were fast.
They were frustrating.
Colorful. Meaningful.
Pathetic.
