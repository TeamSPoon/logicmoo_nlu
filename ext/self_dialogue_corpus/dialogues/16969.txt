Going to any music concerts this Summer.
I might but I'm not sure who is touring.
Jimmy Buffet wil be at Riverbend in July.
Wow! I love Buffet.
Wasting Away Again is a classic.
Makes me want to drink a Margarita.
And Willie Nelson will be there a week later.
I should definitely see Willy in concert before he quits touring.
I don't see Willy stopping until he passes away.
They don't make them like that any more.
Rod Stewart will be in concert later in the year.
Beating of my Heart anthem song is a favorite of mine.
He'll be there with the original Material Girl.
Lauper's Time after Sometime still makes me nostaligic.
I wanted to see Rush in concert when they were in Ohio but I couldn't swing it.
I missed the Snakes and Arrows album tour.
Rush is still my favorite band.
Getty Lee's voice alone.
And Neil on drums.   Tom Sawyer was my teen anthem.
I liked Suburbs even better.
