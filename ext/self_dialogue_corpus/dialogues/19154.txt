what do you think of halsey
she was kind of a guilty pleasure for me
so you do like her
she has some really catchy tunes
like the song with the chainsmokers?
no. i like her newest album though
hopeless is such a good song
my favorite part was the end.
it has that weird distorted sound.
yeah, its very creative.
the whole album was very good.
the concept falls a bit short though
its very loosely based
doesnt take away from the replay value
most concept albums dont have great replay value
so its good that this album is like this to be honest
you could be right
you know i am.
id give the album an 8
same here
