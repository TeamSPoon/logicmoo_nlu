Have you gone to see any bands lately?
Yeah, I went to go see Motorhead a while ago.
Oh, that's cool! I love them!
Yeah they're really good, a lot of very popular stuff.
I know Ace of Spades.
Everyone knows that one at least, they hate to play it.
I'm sure. What does some of their other stuff sound like?
It's pretty much the same kind of vibe, the same singer and similar guitar stuff.
That sounds good to me at least.
Yeah, I like it a lot also. The singer is really tall.
Interesting. He also has a very raspy voice.
That's one of their signature sounds, it wouldn't really be Motorhead without the singer.
It's a shame that he passed away recently.
Yeah, that was very sad. Tons of people are broken up over it.
Well, at least they got a lot of good years in.
That's true, they have been around for a long time.
They've been around since the 80's right?
I think so, though I'm not too sure.
I bet I could find all kind of interesting stuff online about them.
I'm sure, I bet there's a lot of interesting stories with people in the band too.
