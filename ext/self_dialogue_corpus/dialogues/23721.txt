One of my favorite all time movies is The Wickerman. Did you ever see it?
No. Never heard of that one.
Well, let me tell you. It is a messed up movie.
Messed up how.
Well Nick Cage is in it. That should say enough.
Yeah he has really been in some messed up movies.
He acts like his crazy self in this.
What is this about?
Cages Ex gets in touch with him about her missing daughter.
Is he a cop?
Yes, and of course he goes to her rescue.
Is it a comedy?
It's not supposed to be, it's supposed to be a horror film.
Does he make it funny?
Yes. He is just so weird in it. He has to go to an island to help her.
Is there some kind of supernatural forces?
Funny, but no. An island filled with women.
Well that could be scary if you know what I mean.
There are so many weird moments. You gotta watch it.
I'll check it out.
