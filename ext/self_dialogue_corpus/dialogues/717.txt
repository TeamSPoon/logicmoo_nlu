I really miss the NFL at the moment!
I do to, life just seems empty without football!
I know the feeling. We are getting close to the pre-season though!
It always feels like Christmas in my family when the NFL returns.
Yea, me and my dad always set down in front of the TV with some drinks and nachos to kick off the season.
Who is your favorite team?
I am a huge Minnesota Vikings fan!
They have a good young team. I bet you are excited for the future.
I sure am, I have a lot of faith in Mike Zimmer.
Yea, he seems to be doing a pretty good job with them so far.
I feel like we have the foundation to become a playoff team year after year.
Teddy Bridgewater seems to be an outstanding young quarterback.
He really is; I am very excited to watch him grow.
Which draft pick are you the most excited about?
I want to see how good Dalvin Cook can be. He has tons of potential.
He is the running back out of Florida State, correct?
Yes, he is a very fast and physical runner that reminds me of Adrian Peterson.
If he turns out to be that good then you will be very happy, right?
I sure will! Peterson is my favorite Viking of all time.
I can see why, he turned out to be a legend.
