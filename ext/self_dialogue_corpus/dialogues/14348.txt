Have you watched The Wizards this year?
Yes I have.
They have got a lot better!
Yes!  And the record shows it.
Do you think they could have beat Boston in the second round?
Yes I do.
I think that they just did not have quite enough fire power.
That, and the fact that Boston seemed to have a different guy get hot every game.
I thought Isaha Thomas was going to win it all by himself after that 50 point game.
Really! They could not stop him.
No they could not.
They did keep his points down after that game.
Yes they did but; It made it hard for them to gaurd other guys with some much put on gaurding him.
That is true.
They did not have a cjoice though.
That is right, left alone he would have shot the lights out every game.
He did pretty well anyway!
Yep! You cannot totally stop him.
Did you see that Boston got the first pick in the draft next year.
I did..that sucks!
