Hey i haven't been following NBA lately, what's going on?
You serious!? It's the playoffs!
I know, I know, i want to get back into it I have just been busy at school.
Understandable, well like I said it is the playoffs.
What is going on? Who is left?
Well, teams are battling for a chance in their respective conference finals.
I'm guessing the cavs and warriors are still in it?
Yeah, of course they are.  The celtics are still playing the wizards.
How's James Harden doing, is he still cooking it up this year?
Harden actually blew it the other night, had an awful game and ended the Rockets playoff run and season.
What did he do!?  He was like one of my favorite players.
He only made TWO shots all game and had like 6 turnovers.
