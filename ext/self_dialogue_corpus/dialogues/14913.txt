What was your favorite Hangover movie?
That's a tough one. They were all funny.
For me, it was the first one.
I would probably agree. The second and third one just seem to recycle the same jokes.
The third one was a huge disappointment.
I thought the one where they went to Bangkok was even worse.
That was definitely stupid they just thought it would be funny by putting it in Bangkok.
Plus the getting a tattoo like they did is over done.
Well, I'm just glad that they've stopped making them now.
Completely agree.
