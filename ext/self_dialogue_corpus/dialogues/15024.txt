Do you prefer musical comedies or straight comedies?
Definitely musical comedies. They're so much campier!
Agreed, like have you seen the Rocky Horror Picture Show?
Isn't that, you know, a horror film?
No, it parodies horror movies! It's so funny!
Who was in it?
Tim Curry as the lead role as the villain, and Barry Bostwick and Susan Surandon play his victims.
I'll watch anything with Susan Surandon in it.
You should check it out. The music is hilarious too.
You've sold me!
