Have you ever seen The Silence of the Lambs movie?
I am sure I have but it has been a while.
Yes it came out in 1991, and I was streaming it on Netflix.
Anthony Hopkins plays Hannibal in that one. He plays an amazing villain in it.
Yes, it is hard to beat Anthony Hopkins.
Who was the woman again that played the FBI agent?
Jody Foster played the young FBI agent that Hannibal will speak to during the movie.
I liked her work in that movie, she was really cleaver in it.
I think they both got awards for that film.
No doubt, it is a classic.
