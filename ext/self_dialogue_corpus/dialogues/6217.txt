the lion king was my favorite disney movie do you have one
not really I like so many of them
the animation is their movies is beyond the top
yes especially as technology keeps advancing, how about frozen
yes they did a terrific job with that one
remember in the early days like cinderella and snow white how much difference there was
for sure but still love to watch them as well
oh I agree walt disney is one phenomenal company the produces top quality of everything
makes me want to watch a disney movie now
lets go watch mullan at my house right now
