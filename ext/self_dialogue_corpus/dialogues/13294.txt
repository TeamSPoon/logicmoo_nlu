Have you heard anything about this new character that's getting introduced in The Last Jedi?
I don't know much about her. But I have heard that they're working on a Han Solo movie at some point.
It'll be great to see him make the famous Kessel run. Talk about iconic.
Yeah, I'm really sad about what happened to his character in The Force Awakens. I wonder what will happen to Leia.
It's hard to say but I am scared for the worst, given the circumstances. I hope they give her a good send off.
It really feels like the end of an era. But that makes me excited for the beginning of a new one.
That's really what Star Wars is all about, when you think about it. I think Rey has got to be a Skywalker.
Why is that?
Because these movies have always been about the Skywalker lineage. And since we're talking about out with the old and in with the new, it kind of seems like Luke is passing the torch here.
I guess if something did happen to Luke, there wouldn't be any Skywalkers left besides Leia. So maybe you're right about that.
