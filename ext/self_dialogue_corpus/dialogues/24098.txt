I'm going to the movies later.
Really? What are you seeing?
I'm probably gonna decide when I get there.
Well what's in theaters now?
I think like, King Kong and stuff.
I don't want to see that.
I didn't ask if you wanted to see it.
Alright well thanks for the info I guess.
Well what movies do you like?
I like movies from Trey and Matt.
Who?
The South Park guys?
I'm not familiar.
They did a movie called BASEketball.
What's that about?
They create a game and it goes big.
I'll check that out.
Yeah you should.
I'm gonna watch King Kong first.
Fine!
