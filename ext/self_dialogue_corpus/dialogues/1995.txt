What do you think of Ray Lewis from the Baltimore Ravens?
He is one of my favorite players of all time.
Why do you like him?
I love his intensity.
What about his off the field issues?
I've watched a few things about him and I think he was innocent.
Ray seems like a crazy guy.
No, he's really a humble person off the field.
What about on the field?
He's a maniac all about destroying the other team.
I never really like him.  I always thought he was overrated.
He was one of the best players in the league!  How can you call him overrated?
I thought that defense had so much talent that it just made him look better.
You could have put Ray Lewis on the Cleveland Browns and he would have been dominate.
Well Ray Lewis only won 2 Super Bowls.
He won 2 Super Bowls with average quarterbacks.
Joe Flacco was a good quarterback.
What about Trent Dilfer?
I guess that is a good point. Trent Dilfer wasn't a good quarterback.
Yeah Dilfer wasn't good but Ray Lewis and that defense still won a Super Bowl with him.
