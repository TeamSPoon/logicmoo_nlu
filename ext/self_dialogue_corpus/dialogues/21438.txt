Hey Joey!
Tony! Hey!
What's up?
Not a thing. You?
I got some stuff going.
You got stuff going?
Yeah, I got stuff going. What do you care?
I don't.
That's why I like you, Joey. Too simple to care...
Thanks, but I thought you liked me because I look like that guy from the movie, "The 300." You know, the one with all the Abs.
That is exactly why I like you, Joey. Because you look like the actor, Gerard Butler, who played "Leonidas" in the movie, "The 300."
That's what I thought.
But I don't think you quite got it yet. I do think of you when I see Gerard Butler, but it's not because of the movie, "The 300."
It's not?
No. It's not.
Then what is it?
It's another movie. You remind me of that guy, but in another movie.
What movie?
Phantom of the Opera.
Phantom of the Opera? But you never seen me in a cape.
