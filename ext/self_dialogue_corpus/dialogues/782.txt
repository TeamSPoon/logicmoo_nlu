What team are you a fan of?
The Giants.
Because of a few years ago?
No man, it's hereditary. I've been a lifelong fan.
Oh yeah?
Yeah one of my first memories is the Super Bowl against the Bills.
The wide right game?
Yeah. Interestingly, the Giants wanted it to come down to that.
What do you mean?
They planned to let Thurman Thomas run all over them.
Okay...
But didn't want to let Jim Kelly complete a pass.
So they had a lot of long downs?
Exactly. Make a lot of 3rd and forevers.
So what, they made Norwood kick?
Yeah, they knew he wasn't a great kicker at distance.
That's a pretty clever trap.
Set by Bill Belichick.
Whaaaaaat?
Yep, he's an evil genius.
