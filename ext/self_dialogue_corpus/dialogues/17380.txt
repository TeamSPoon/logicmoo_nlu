Hey. Are you play to vocal practice?
Yes. I can find an open practice room.
I know what you mean, it can be difficult to find one in the afternoon.
Yes, I know but I must practice. What music are you on your way to practice?
My instructor has me working on old show tunes. Right now, I am on my way to practice my piece from 'The King and I.'
Oh, that sounds neat. What is your favorite song so far from the musical?
There are several. It is a classic. So far, play like Anna's song "I Whistle a Happy Tune."
That is a good one.
I think it works very nicely for my vocal range.
I can see that. Did you know that musical was based on a book?
I didn't know that.
Yes. The book itself was based on a real person.
Really?
Yes. Anna Leonowens. She has quite an interesting and storied history.
Well, it works nicely as a musical.
Oh definitely. Once Rodgers and Hammerstein got a hold of it.
You know the touring company is currently in Chicago.
We should get tickets to go see it. That would be a treat.
I will check into the ticket cost and get back with you.
Thank you. I really look forward to it.
