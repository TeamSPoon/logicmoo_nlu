What do you think about patriotic music?
I like it.
Lee greenwood does my favorite song.
That has to be god bless the u s a.
That's the one.
It still gives me chills.
It's my wife's favorite too.
He had quite a few hits besides that one.
Sure he did.
Dixie road was good,mornin ride.
How about hearts aren't made to break or holdin a good hand.
All good songs.
I wish people would embrace patriotic music more.
Yea,me too.
This,is,America,show you love,it.
How about Neil Diamonds America.
Absolutely love it.
Great song indeed.
I believe it's from the jazz singer.
Yes it is.
