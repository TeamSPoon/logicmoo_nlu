Toy Story is one of my favorites animated movies ever.
The fourth part will be released in June 2019
I didn't know that.  How do you know about it?
I saw it on Facebook last week.
It is official?
I do not know yet. But if you want I will send you the link where I saw it.
If It is true I hope Tom Hanks and Tim Allen will be together again in this franchise.
They should. Their voices have been very symbolic in all the movies.
Also Rex's voice it's one of the best. Who is that actor?
He's Wallace Shawn. He worked in "The incredibles" too as "Mr. Huph", the Bob's boss.
