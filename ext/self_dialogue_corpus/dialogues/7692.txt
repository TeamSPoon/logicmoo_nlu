Have you seen all the Harry Potter movies?
Yea, I think so. Although some of the earlier movies kind of blend into one movie in my head.
I know what you mean. The last two movies were so good though right?!
Yea, I feel like now Daniel Radcliffe and Emma Watson and Rupert Grint grew up a bit that their acting was so much better and so much more enjoyable.
I agree. Even the storylines for the last few movies was a lot more grown up and a lot darker.
Yea, you see certain characters that you've really grown attached to die in the final battle.
It was so sad when Fred Weasley died. And Dobby's death was super sad too.
And Hedwig! For some reason that one hit me the hardest.
I totally cried during that scene.
Me too. She was with him since the beginning.
