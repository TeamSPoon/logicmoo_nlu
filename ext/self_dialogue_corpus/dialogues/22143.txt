So what's your take on the whole time travel genre of movies? I have seen a fees advertised lately.
I mean. It depends on the situation. It's hard to get the plot right.
A lot of science fiction movies are all about time travel.
Have you ever seen the Time Machine movie ?
The old one or the semi newer movie ?
I didn't know they made an old one.
Yes. It was in the seventies I think.
Was it any good ?
It was funny Cheesy , but kind of moving
I like those old time travel cheesy films.
So yes, the old one haven't seen the new one.
Well it is aboit H.G Wells traveling back in time.
A movie about the book?
Kind of. But he just gets into a lot of issues.
Is the world the movie is set in cool ?
It's an odd one for sure.
Is every one dead in a few hundred years.
No. Well. They are more like in a weird trance.
All of them ?
No the movie has some bad guys that more or less heard humans.
