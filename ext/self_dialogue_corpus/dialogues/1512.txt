What team do you follow?
I like the lions
Oh yea? Are you excited that Ameer is coming back?
of course! hopefully we will have a good season this year.
It seems like the lions do well in preseason then they choke
Yup. It's tough being a fan.
Do you like any other teams?
Not really, I mean I always root for the underdogs in the superbowl.
Really? So, you want the falcons to win.
Yes, I am not a Brady fan at all.
Hmm... What did you think of deflate-gate?
It was a bit ridiculous, i'll have to admit that.
yea it seemed like there was a lot of new information coming out every day.
Oh well, Brady is still going...
True.
Who do you root for?
The packers.
Ah, that's too bad.
Yea, well I love Aaron Rodgers.
I'll give you that.
