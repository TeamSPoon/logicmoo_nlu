So did you get to see Logan yet?
No not yet, I missed it in theaters.
Ah, it just came out on blu-ray this week, totally recommend it.
I'm not too into super hero moves though, would I like it?
I would say even more since you don't like super hero movies.
What does that mean?
It borrows a lot from westerns and stuff like The Last of Us.
Oh so it's not just a big action flick?
Nope, it has a lot of quiet introspective moments.
That's different from other X-men movies.
Yeah that's because it isn't an X-men movie.
But Logan and Xavier are in it, no?
Yes but it's not about the X-men, they're disbanded.
Disbanded?
Yeah it's in a world where mutants are looked down upon, shunned.
And Logan and Xavier are just walking around?
No, Logan is keeping Xavier locked up due to a mental illness that's harming people.
Oh interesting.
Trust me you'll love it.
Then I'll definitely give it a rent, thanks.
