What is your favorite kind of music?
I like a lot of the classic rock type stuff, like Bob Seger.
What is your favorite Bob Seger song?
I think Turn the Page is my favorite song. It is really easy to sing along to.
He really has a cool voice, kind of gritty and real. It's weird that his music is so old though.
Some music never really gets old. I heard Bob Seger's Old Time Rock and Roll on the radio the other day.
Yeah, it's just weird to think of rock stars as old. He's in his 70s now.
Some of the stuff now is just awful compared to the old rock legends.
That's true. I do like a lot of the old classic songs.
I bet you like a lot of Bob Seger music and just don't realize that's what you're hearing.
Yeah, I just looked up some songs and I didn't even realize he was the one who sang Hollywood Nights!
I just feel like his music is easier to listen to and more real than a lot of the music now.
It is a big change from the rap I usually listen to.  I found a YouTube link for Turn the Page.
Do you like the song?
I didn't even realize I knew it, but you're right. It is easy to sing to.
I used to have some Bob Seger albums, vinyl ones. My mom gave them to me.
Did you ever listen to them?
No, they were more for collecting. I listen to music on Pandora or my computer if I downloaded it.
Where can I find a bunch of Bob Seger music in one place?
You can just type in his name in YouTube or do a search in Spotify or Pandora. Amazon music has it too.
