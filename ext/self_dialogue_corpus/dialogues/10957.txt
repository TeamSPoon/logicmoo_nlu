Are you into ice hockey at all?
Yeah, a little bit.
Who is your favorite ice hockey team?
Probably the San Jose Sharks
Oh really? What is that?
It goes way back to Jr High school. All of my friends loved the Sharks.
So you still love them now, after all this time?
Yes, pretty much. There are a lot of memories there. Everyone would come to school dressed in turquoise and white colors.
Yes. I have a few Shark jerseys as well.
Yes. I remember having one of their jerseys back in the day. All my friends did.
You are also from the San Francisco Bay Area.
Yes. I am sure that is also a major reason everyone loved them so much.
Of course. Regional pride.
Yes. You always have to represent your own area when it comes to sports.
I agree. Otherwise you may get beat up.
Yes. If you do not support your own, you quickly lose the respect of your peers.
Who is your favorite Sharks player of all time?
Patrick Marleau of course.
What what was your favorite Sharks game ever played?
I would say in 2010, when they played against the Red Wings. I loved how Marleau and Thornton rescued the game.
