Hey Susie you watching the game tonight?
Oh definitely Bob is in town and he doesn't miss his Eagles games.
I love the Eagles actually, do you watch the games with him?
Hell yeah, they are my team!
I didn't know that about you, very cool.
You should come through, I didn't know you were such a big NFL fan yourself.
I used to play in high school, quarterback.
Oh wow, who is your favorite QB in the NFL?
Since we're talking Eagles I might as well say Carson Wentz, the guy is an inspirational rookie.
He is definitely amazing, in a  couple years he will be perfect.
Rookie seasons are hard for everyone, very up and down.
he has to fit in with the Eagles' coaching and team, once he gets acclimated he will be good.
I completely agree, just better sooner than later.
Who are they playing?
They are playing the Saints tonight!
Oh man I gotta watch that matchup, Drew Breez vs Wentz.
I love that matchup too, very cool when the old school faces new blood.
I couldn't have said it better myself!
Game starts at around 7pm, be here a bit before.
Ok, let me change into my Eagles jersey and I'll be there!
