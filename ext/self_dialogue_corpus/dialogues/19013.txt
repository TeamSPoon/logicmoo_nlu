Did you know that Tears for Fears is going back out on tour?
I didn't even know they were still together.
They broke up once or twice, but they're working on a new record.
That's great. I haven't heard anything from them since the mid-90s.
You didn't check out Everybody Loves a Happy Ending?
Is that one of their singles?
It was their last album, released in 2001.
No, I can't say that I even knew about it.
Check it out. Oh, and the tour will be with Hall & Oates.
See I'm not a huge fan of Hall & Oates.
I like the big hits, but I don't know much of their other work.
They were good to dance to in the clubs back in the 80s, but that's about it.
I hope to God the two aren't just doing a big 1980s-show.
How do you mean?
Well, I really like Tears for Fears, but I don't like nostalgia shows.
Oh, I get you.
I would hope that after ten years they would have something new.
Well there's only one way to find out.
Get tickets? Way ahead of you.
I hope they show's not on a weekday.
