So, just a little under 3 months and Football Season starts.
I can't wait. You still rootin for the Texans?
You know it!
J.J. Watt playing this year?
Of course! I was just reading an article about him the other day.
What did it say?
Thry interviewed J.J. and he was saying he can't wait to grt on the field.
I don't doubt it, he was strong last season untill that back injury.
Yes, it was devistating. I think the Texans would have went a lot farther had that not happened.
Agreed, J.J is a wrecking machine!
True. Coach O'Brien said he is looking good in practice.
I'm glad he recovered.
Deshawn Watson is itching to get on the field as well.
Oh, cool, he was having some trouble last year.
Well, the rookie years can be tough.
That's true.
I have a feeling his sophmore season will be much better.
Well, he's nominated for 2 ESPY's so he has potential.
He has talent as well.
I wholeheartly agree.
