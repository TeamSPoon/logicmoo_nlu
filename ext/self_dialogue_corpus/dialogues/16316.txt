Do you like Bob Dylan?
Sure do! I saw him in concert a few years ago in Philly.
How was it?
Well, actually a bit disapointing.
Why is that?
Well he was sitting behind his piano and you could not even see him, and there were NO big screen tvs to see him on.
What did he sing?
He sang some of his classics like Positively 4th Street and Like a Rolling Stone.
Nice! What else?
Some of his newer songs. But really did not put much effort into any of them and seemed like he had a bit too much to drink.
Wow. That stinks.
Yes, it was probably the worst concert I have seen and I expected a lot more from a great like him.
I love his songs Just Like A Woman and I want you.
How about Mr. Tamborine Man?
Yea that was a good one too.
Well I would like to see him but I do not think he tours that much anymore
Well he is getting pretty old now.
He will always be a classic no matter what.
That is true. His music has spanned fifty years or more
I know, an amazing career!
