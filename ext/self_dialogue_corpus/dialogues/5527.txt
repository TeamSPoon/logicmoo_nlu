What was with the whole Frozen thing?
That movie was a juggernaut.
I don't get it, how was it so popular?
Little girls just ate it up. Everyone wanted to be Elsa.
No kidding, the costumes were everywhere.
Credit were it's due though. Olaf was a good villain.
Josh Gad. He's something of a hidden talent.
Speaking of hidden talents, Duke was Alan Tudyk.
He's genius in everything.
Absolutely. His acting is good, but his voiceovers are beyond comparison.
