Why were Luke and Leia sent to different families on different planets after Padme's death?
To make it more difficult for Darth Vader to find them.
But Darth Vader, or Anakin was their father.
Yes, but remember Aaikin killed all the Jedi children when he turned to the dark side.
So you think he would have killed his own children?
Yes.  He had turned completely to the dark side.
But Vader rejected the dark side at the end of "Return of the Jedi".
Yes, but when Luke and Leia were born, he would have killed them if he could find them.
Probably so.
Defiantly so.  That is why Kenobi hid them from him.
