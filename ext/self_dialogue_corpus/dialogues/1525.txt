So tell me what you think of the Browns this year?
They'll still be at the bottom of the league without a quarterback.
But their defense is going to be a lot better, right?
I would think so based on their new draft picks. They have one of the best defensive ends in Myles Garrett now.
In the NFL, if you have an elite player at defensive end, you can survive in the league.
It's one of the 2-3 most important positions in football.
But they're still so weak at the top position: quarterback.
They really don't have to win this year. All they have to do is improve on last season, and that will give fans hope.
Yes. And then in the next draft they can target a starting quarterback.
That's really all it's about: giving fans hope. Not every team is making the Super Bowl, but giving hope that you can make it in 2-3 years is a good thing.
What other positions did they improve on?
They have a really good safety in Jabrill Peppers. He was taken #25 in the draft.
I think they'll keep games close thanks to their offense, but they still won't be able to score.
If Cody Kessler can stay healthy, and if David Njoku proves he can catch and block, they may be better on offense.
What's your outlook on how many games they can win?
4-5 would be a great achievement, especially if they keep the other games close.
Being competitive in games that you lose can be a good thing. Like you said, it gives fans hope for the next season.
They did also draft a QB in the second round, but he's not ready this year.
And Kessler did look good last year when he was able to stay on the field.
Either way, they still need to get a game changing QB in the 2018 draft to complete their transformation.
