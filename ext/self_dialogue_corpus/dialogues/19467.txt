What kind of music would you like to have at your wedding some day?
That's a great question. Let me think.
I love Shania Twain, do you remember her?
What did she sing again?
She was a country singer from Canada from back in the 90's.
Oh okay, can you name any of her songs?
"You're still the One" was a beautiful song.
Oh I think I've heard that.
My dad and his wife played it at their wedding.
Which album was that from?
It was from "Come On Over".
When did it come out?
The album released in 1997.
Oh okay. What else was on it?
The song called "From This Moment On."
That was such a beautiful song.
I know I so agree, I would play that at my wedding.
I would too.
I think I will have to look up more music also but I love hers.
Me too. I can't wait for my wedding.
