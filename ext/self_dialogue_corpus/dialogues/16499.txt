What do you think of Lady Gaga's music?
Never really thought about it.
She actually has a lot of good songs. I think she's talented.
She does put on a good show, from what I heard.
I really like her most recent song called A Million Reasons.
Is that a slower song?
Yes. She even produces her music too.
Does she write her own songs?
Some of them she does, along with other people.
Writing music takes talent. Not all artists do.
She performed a tour with Tony Bennet a few years back.
Do you mean the old singer?
Yes, they did a tour called Cheek to Cheek.
How did that go over with her fans?
Actually good. The two got great reviews together.
I like the song Born this way.
Yes, that was a great song.
She is also an activist for foundations too.
Yes, she founded the Born this Way Foundation.
Not only talented, but cares about people.
