Do you like The Shining?
I love it. It's one of my favorites of all-time.
Did you read Stephen King's book the film is based on?
Yes. It's a rare instance where the book and movie are equally good.
Stephen King does not agree. He dislikes Kubrick's film version.
Oh really? Why?
Well, Kubrick did not use King's screenplay and called his writing weak.
Ouch. That's cold.
Harsh, right? Also, he did not like Jack Nicholson being cast as Jack Torrance.
Nicholson is one of the best parts of the film!
Well, King's argument was that Jack Nicholson appears a bit crazy immediately.
Well, maybe a bit true.
The character's madness is supposed to be gradual.
Yeah, brought on by the hotel.
I am undecided about Shelley Duvall in that film. I kind of like her but  also feel she is the weakest link.
Kubrick was really rough on her.
Yes. I read that the filming was quite traumatic for her.
That film scared me so much when I was a kid.
I remember when I saw those twins I ran to hide under my bed!
Yes. I am going to re-watch it tonight!
