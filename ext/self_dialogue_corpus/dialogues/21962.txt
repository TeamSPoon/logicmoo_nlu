Have you seen the Hangover movies?
Only the first one. I thought it was kind of dumb.
How could you think it was dumb? That movie was hysterical!
I don't know, a tiger in the bathroom is pretty far-fetched.
You know it is a movie right? It doesn't have to be realistic.
Oh, I know. I guess if I want to see something that far out, just give me a fantasy movie.
What about Superbad?
Saw it, hated it.
Do you have a no sense of humor?
Of course I do, I just didn't like that one.
Ok, then you tell me. What funny movies do you like?
I laugh hysterically to this day at Napolean Dynamite.
You have to be kidding me. You thought The Hangover was stupid yet you like that?
Sadly yes. Borat too.
Oh my gosh. You have terrible taste in movies.
Borat was so funny though! The concept was genious.
I'm not sure I'd go that far.
Setting unsuspecting people up to make a film about it just worked.
Well, not as well for Bruno.
Ok, you got me there.
