I heard a great new album recently.
Oh really that is great.
Yes sometimes there is not always great new music to listen to.
Yes that is true.
That is why I so happy to hear Kendrick Lamar's new album.
Oh really, is it that good?
Yes it is amazing.
What is so great about it?
It combines the most amazing sounding beats with great lyrics.
Ok that is special.
Yes and I recommend you listen to the same song twenty times.
Wow that is a lot of repetition!
Yes it is worth repeating.
Ok I will give it a repeated listen then.
You will not regret it.
Ok thank you for the information.
You can listen to the two best songs the most.
Which two are those?
Humble and DNA are the best.
I sincerely thank you for the recommendation.
