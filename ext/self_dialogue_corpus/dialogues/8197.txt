I'm going to defend Justin Bieber.
You're a 33-year old man who hates pop music. What could you say?
Look, no one is jealous of him, like his supporters say.
Clearly.
We hate him because he's a completely entitled, immature jerk who gets away with petty crime.
True, but Ellen forgave him, so we have to!
Funny. Anyway, he's insanely musically talented.
How so?
He can sing in many genres. He plays a lot of instruments: trumpet, piano, guitar, drums.
Yeah, true, but he's still a jerk.
