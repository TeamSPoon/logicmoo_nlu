What do you think of Lady Gaga?
She's okay...
Just okay?
Yea, her music is quite cliche
I can see your perspective
Yea, it just sounds like everything else
Did you know that she was influanced by Queen?
Really!?  You'd neer have thought it
Yea i agree
Might be becuase Freddy Mercury was gay
Yea it could be
I mean she is an avid supporter of gay rights
Very true
Too bad Freddy's dead
Yea he was great
Agreed
Glad we can at least agree on that
For sure!
I gotta run
Later!
