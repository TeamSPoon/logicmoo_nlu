What do you think about the music they're pumping out these days?
You mean the talent-less hack auto tune garbage on the radio?
I guess so.
It's total garbage. What do you think?
Yeah, I don't know what happened or when it changed.
90's, 80's then even worse hitting 2000, Napster, The Pirate Bay and on and on..
Yep, nothing like the late 60's. Wow, what happened to all of that?
Gutarists can't solo anymore. The guitar used to be a "voice" now anybody can be a singer with a computer fixing their voices key.
Sad, and when do you think was the greatest time of music?
If it wasn't the 60's then we have to go back to the 20's. We've got to get back to Jazz.
Jazz? Are you kidding me?
No! Let's go back to Ragtime, Big Band and New Orleans. This is the birthplace.
The birthplace of what?
Improvisation which is the foundation for anything new.
Uh huh, like how rock came from Jazz?
Jazz and Blues, Yes! And this is what has happened to music in the last 30 years.
We've lost that ability..
Correct and you know what the really sad thing is?
What?
We'll never see it again.
