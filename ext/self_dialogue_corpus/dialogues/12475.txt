Where do you think Star Wars goes from here?
I think Kylo Ren becomes the next Darth Vader.
For the rest of the series?
Well do we know how long its actually going to go?
No but I am presuming quickly.
I mean Kylo Ren could become Darth Ren
That would not sound right at all
Well he will be the next villain for countless movies
Yeah I think thats where he ends up
And Rey becomes the next Luke
