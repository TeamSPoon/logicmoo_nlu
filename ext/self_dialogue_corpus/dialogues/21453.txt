Did you watch Logan yet?
Yea, I actually just saw it last weekend.
Did you like it?
It was alright, was not my favorite.
What about it did you not like?
First off, it was really long.
I can see that, it was over 2 hours.
They could have easily cut out 30 minutes or so.
A lot of time was wasted at the final meeting spot with the kids.
Yea, also in the beginning before he meets X23.
I was OK with it but I can see it being long.
Also, the ending was hilariously bad visually.
You mean the kid's powers?
Yea, they looked like some low budget TV show.
That stood out a little to me too.
Up to that point, the movie looked so raw and brutal.
Is there really a way to make superpowers look better?
I feel like they did it better on older Marvel movies.
Maybe they just spent too much money elsewhere?
It could be the answer.
