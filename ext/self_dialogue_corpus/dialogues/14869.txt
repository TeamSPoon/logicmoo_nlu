Did you ever see Caddyshack?
Oh yeah, classic comedy movie.
Some great scenes in that movie
Yeah, Bill Murray and the gopher
And Rodney Dangerfield and the big boat
Oh and his outfits, what a trip
And don't forget about the pool scene
Yeah that was great, what was it a Snickers bar?
I think Baby Ruth
Yeah, Baby Ruth...classic.
