Who is your favorite rapper?
As a child f the 80's I love LL Cool J!
What? He's no where near the top 10!
You're crazy? His career has spanned decades.
He's known as an actor now.
That does not take away from his music career.
You are older than me so tell me about him.
He started a lot of fashion trends like the Kango hat, as well as great music.
Really? What else?
He was one of the first rappers to do slow music rap songs.
Like what?
His song "I need love." You should definitely google that one.
But didn't he lose a big rap battle to Canibus?
Yeah, he lost that one, but nobody is undefeated, even Jay-Z. But he is known as one of the best battle rappers ever.
Who did he beat?
his legendary battles with Kool Moe Dee are some of the best music ever.
So i may need to brush up on his music.
Well there is a ton of music for you to listen too.
Thanks for putting me on to him.
No problem. You'll really thank me later.
