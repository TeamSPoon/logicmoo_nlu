What are your favorite songs from Disney movies.
I liked You've Got a Friend in Me.
My favorite is A Whole New World
The music is not overdone most of the time
It adds emotion and helps you relate to the characters
All of the characters are great singers
Aladdin and Jasmine are good ones.
So was Ariel
Maybe it's a princess thing
Most of them are love songs
