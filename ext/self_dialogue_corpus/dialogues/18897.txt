So, what new bands have you found out about lately?  I know you're always finding out about something new or different.
To tell you the truth, I recently found out about a Japanese hard rock/metal band called X Japan, and they're awesome!
Wow!  So what do they sound like?
They sound like melodic metal or melodic hard rock depending on the song, at least their old stuff does.
So they fit in with that glam rock that you always liked from the 1980s, correct?
Yes!  In Japan they are considered the innovators of the Visual Kei style of hard rock music, which is sort of the Japanese version of glam rock.
Interesting.  So how did you stumble across them, I'm assuming on Youtube?
Yes it was Youtube.  I forget how it happened but I saw this video about them and Gene Simmons of KISS said they were amazing!
Really?  So they must be pretty big time and influential then.
Oh yes absolutely!  Gene Simmons said that if they were from America they could have been the biggest rock stars of all time!
Amazing.  How much have they sold so far in their career?
Let me check my phone...they've sold 30 million albums worldwide, and they're especially huge in Japan.
That's not too surprising.  It's somehow strange that people just started hearing about them stateside.
Yes it is, but one guy in the video said their drummer, Yoshiki, is a "different level of rock star".
Well that sure sounds like a compliment.  It sounds like they're really good performers.
They are!  Their old videos from the 80s and early 90s have am amazing level of energy and showmanship!
That makes me think about the Scorpions for some reason!
Yeah just like the Scorpions they had an amazing level of energy back then.
But do they take it to another level?
I think so, why don't I show you a Youtube video I have bookmarked?
