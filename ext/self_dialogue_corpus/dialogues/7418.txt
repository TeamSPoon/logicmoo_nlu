I saw the Disney movie"The Lion King", last night on TV it was good.
That movie is very old.
A new remake is coming out this year.
Disney just came out with "Beauty and the Beast" remake.
The kids like the Disney movies,
There is a movie called "The Good Dinosaur" that my little cousin likes  to watch.
Yeah, the kids love that movie,it is about the little dinosaur trying to do the right thing in his town.
There is another Disney movie called "The Boss Baby" that the kids like to watch too.
I saw that on DVD, it was a good movie.
I know everyone has seen the movie "Lion King", that was one of my favorite Disney movies.
