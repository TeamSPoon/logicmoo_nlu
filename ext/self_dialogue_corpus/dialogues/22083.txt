What's your favorite Paul Walker movie?
Oh why are you trying to make me sad?
Sorry! You know I love Paul too.
I know. It's so sad he's gone.
I like watching his films to keep his spirit alive.
Fair enough. I really like Varsity Blues.
Oh I love that one too. He's gorgeous there.
And so sweet too.
I think I first saw him in Pleasantville.
Oh wow I forgot he was in that one!
Yeah I have to go back and watch that again. It was so good.
I liked Into the Blue with him and Jessica Alba too.
They were so beautiful in that. I didn't like it the first time I saw it, but the more I watched, they more I enjoyed it.
What's your favorite?
I would have to say Joy Ride.
Another one I forgot about!
I love that movie. Such a good thriller and he has such a big part.
Who played his brother again?
Steve Zahn.
Oh yeah! Highly underrated actor in my opinion.
