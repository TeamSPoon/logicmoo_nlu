Did you watch the nfl draft this year?
Yes, I actually did watch all three days.
Really? Who is your team?
I am a browns fan.
Oh, okay. Well, I like the steelers.
Oh no...
Yeah...but I was happy wih our draft.
Yeah, I wa okay with ours for the firt few rounds.
I tought it was good at first, but after researching, your picks could all be big or bust type players.
Yeah, that is a bit worrisome to me.
Yeah.
You guys made some pretty good picks though.
Yeah, I liked the first pick.
Yeah, jj watts brother.
Hopefully he is close to being as good as his brother.
Yeah, his brother is very good.
I wish they would have went higher on the cornerbacks.
Yeah, I understand, but they did pick two of them.
Yeah, hopefully they will work out.
Yeah, ou do need to get another corner.
