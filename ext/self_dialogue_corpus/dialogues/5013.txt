Yes, I'm definitely going to catch that.
Do you think he's the greatest Yankee of all time?
No, my vote goes for Mr. October -- Reggie Jackson.
Wow! He's my favorite Yankee too!
I knew I liked you.
Thanks! We should get together and watch the ceremony!
Yes, that sounds like a lot of fun. We could also catch the double header in the afternoon.
Oh, who are the boys playing?
The Astros. They just got into town.
Great! Let's head over to the stadium.
How soon can you be ready?
I'm ready now! What time does the baseball game start?
It's around 2pm. I think we can make it.
Yes, but I need to grab my mitt.
Yes, I would love to get a memento.
Have you caught a foul ball before?
No, it was a home run!
Wow! I bet that happens to us today!
Yes, today is turning into a great day. Thanks!
