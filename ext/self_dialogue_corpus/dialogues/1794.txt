What do you think the eagles are going to do this year?
Same as every year.
What's that?
Fail miserably!
Ha,  No I dont think so. I think they will be pretty good.
Yea maybe. They got 2 new receivers that are proven.
True, I cant wait to see them with our QB.
Yea theyre gonna light up the scoreboard.
Our defense is where most of our talent is.
Fletcher Cox is a beast!
So is the rest of the D-line.
Gonna shut Dallas down hard.
Well lets not go to extremes.
Dallas is good I know that.
Yea they are and I dont think you can shut them down..
Right , you can only hope to contain them.
Exactly. Hopefully we are good this year and next draft is the key. we need to build up the o-line more.
And we need to get a stud runningback!
I hate playing catch up to Dallas.
Seems like thats all we ever do.
