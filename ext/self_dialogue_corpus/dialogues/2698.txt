So who do you think are the greatest football players of all time?
Which position?
Any of them, but let's start with quarterback.
Well, for starters, Tom Brady might be the GOAT.
You think he is greater than Joe Montana?
I think his last superbowl definitely put him over the edge.
So who else would you put on that list?
Well, I think Montana, of course, and also players like Elway.
Elway is phenomenal.
Yes, but he doesn't have as many rings as those other guys.
Well what about Staubach and Manning?
Those guys are great - Manning got a ring on his way out.
I agree, but of course they probably don't stand up to Brady.
Brady has just been too good for too long.
Yes I agree, but stability and coaching have helped.
Yes they have - they are consistently great.
So how is Brady going to do this year, will he slow down?
Maybe a little, but he will be a force, as usual.
Tom Brady is the greatest quarterback of all time.
Yes, I agree.
