Who is your favorite MLB team?
The Arizona Diamondbacks
Nice, they are off to a good start this year.
That they are but we'll see if they keep it up.
I'm a braves fan so I don't have much hope.
You must be really disappointed that Freeman got hurt.
Definitely, he was playing like an MVP.
He will be tough to replace but you got former Diamondback Swanson to lead you know.
The braves definitely got the better of that trade.
Do you follow any teams in the American League?
I follow Cleveland because my dad is a fan of them.
He must be loving the last couple of years.
He's still not that impressed but he's very biased.
Wow, he should be thrilled.
I know but he is a very critical sports fan.
Do you follow college baseball at all?
I do. I follow my alma mater, Florida State.
Nice, they've been so close to winning it all so many times.
I know, maybe this year is the year.
I root for Texas so I'm hopeful as well.
