What's your favorite action movie?
I'd have to say Heat
Yea, Robert De Niro was so good
It had the perfect blend of action and character development
It had such good actors and the directors really took it to the next level
It was interesting to see all the movies that copied it.
I think The Town was nearly a direct copy of Heat.
Yea, but they did give homage to it with some scenes of it playing on Ben Afflecks characters tv.
It's hard to get such quality action films
There are a few good ones which I will always rewatch.
