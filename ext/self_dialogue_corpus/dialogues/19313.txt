Do you remember SOnny and Cher?
Sure I do.
They had some really good songs.
They sure did , what are some of your favorites?
I got you babe was one of them
Yea I liked that one too
For a few years there they were a really hot couple and cool singing duo
Yea but then they kind of died off
Until they put on the Sonny and CHer show on TV
I remember that! They had a lot of musical guests
And Cher would always sing and be dressed in some gorgeous outrageous outfil
Yea, she sure had a good body!
And great hair
And Sonny would sing too
They had a great reportoire
Always cracking jokes and singing together
Remember the song Gypsies, Tramps and Theives
Yea that was a good one
Sonny died way too young, and Cher , she just looks incredible to this day
She sure does!
