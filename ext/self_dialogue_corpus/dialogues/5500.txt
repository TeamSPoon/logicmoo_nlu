The scene where Mufasa dies in The Lion King is always so sad.
I know, it makes me cry everytime even though I know what's going to happen.
He's just such a great character.
And James Earl Jones does such a good job playing him.
Also, I just really feel for Simba--thinking you hurt your own family...how terrible.
On the other hand, the scenes with Timon and Pumba are so funny!
No doubt--Hakuna Matata is such a good song for cheering yourself up.
I also find Rafiki hilarious.
Which one is he?
The baboon, silly!
