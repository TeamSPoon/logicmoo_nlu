Are the Browns ever gonna be good?
I hope so. I bet my friend they would.
How much did you bet?
About 20 bucks
Okay, not too bad
They need to get their team together
I don't know if they can
They can. I don't care if they have been last place forever
You need to cheer for a new team
I am not going to. I am from Cleveland
I'm from Baltimore and I am a Vikings fan
Hey, I like the Vikings too
Really?
Yes. I love their purple colors
Yeah, they are very unique
They might win it one year
They have a good squad.
Not as good as the Patriots
You know, I do not think they will repeat.
Me neither
