I love the movie Psycho with the Norman Bates character. Have you seen it?
I have, actually, yes. But it was a long time ago and I don't remember a whole lot about it.
Does the phrase "Shower scene" ring any bells?
Oh, definitely. That's one of the greatest horror scenes in movie history!
Besides that scene, one very interesting aspect of that movie is definitely Norman Bates himself.
He is definitely a unique character. That's for sure.
I've always liked how he is so unconvincing. He naturally comes off like a nice and charming guy.
That's one thing that probably makes the movie a classic horror film. A character that while he is insane, is still a believable one.
Do you think it should be remade again?
Absolutely not. Some horror films just should not be re-done, even though this one was back in 1998.
