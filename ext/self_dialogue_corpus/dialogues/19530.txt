Who is the greatest rock and roll band of all time?
I would say The Beatles.
I'm more of a fan of Aerosmith.
Aerosmith has had a long career.
They have been around forever.
I like Aerosmith too.
What is your favorite Aerosmith song?
I like Same Old Song and Dance.
My favorite is Eat The Rich.
Wasn't that song in a video game?
Yeah, it was in Revolution X.
Wasn't Aerosmith in that game too?
Yeah, you had to save them and it had an Aerosmith soundtrack.
That was a really fun game.
Aerosmith has seemingly done everything.
They have been around since like the 70s haven't they?
Yeah, I think they started in the 70s.
Man, that is a long career.
It's amazing that they are still going.
I might go see them in concert before they retire.
