Do you remember that race in 2 fast 2 furious?
Which one?
The bridge jump race.
Oh yes of course I remember.
That has to be my favorite street race in the franchise.
Yes it was an incredible race and exciting.
Do you remember who won that race?
Brian of course, how can you not remember that?
I sometimes forget, wasn't he driving the silver and blue car in that one?
Yes he was.
