Which team in the NFL would you like to see go see
I guess the Falcons
The Atlanta Falcons huh?
Yeah. They are pretty good to watch!
I used to live in Atlanta, but never went to see a Pro game
I lived there too but I never did see them at the stadium just on t.v.
They streets are always so crowded when they play in town
I know and theres no where to park downtown
Yeah the games really attract people from most everywhere
I know I once saw someone with Arizona license plates parked at the stadium game night
Wow that was a long drive
A really serious fan
Didnt they go to the Superbowl last year or was it year before last
It was fairly recent
I don't think they won though
They dont win every single time but they are a good team
They are one of my favorites too
We ought to go see a game next year
Yeah lets plan on it.
Its gonna be a long drive....
