What's your favorite obscure movie?
Obscure in what sense?
Obscure in the sense that most people wouldn't have heard of it.
Ah, I see. It's a movie called Tampopo.
What's Tampopo?
Have you ever heard of the genre of American films called Spaghetti Westerns?
Sure, yeah, I've heard of them.
Well, this is a Ramen Western or a Noodle Western.
So is it a spoof then?
Not exactly, it does play around with the tropes of American Westerns.
Is it an American movie?
No, it's a Japanese film.
Do they have a English dubbed version?
As far as I know, no. I saw a version with English subtitles.
Well what's it about?
It's about a woman named Tampopo who is trying to make the perfect bowl of noodles.
So what's the main conflict?
She's not very good at making noodles and she doesn't know anyone who can help her until she meets a man named Goro, who is a truck driver that acts like a cowboy.
And what does Goro do?
After much convincing, he decides to help her out. You must see this film, it's a love affair with food.
