Do you know the beatles song Real Love?
I don't think I know that one.
I think a lot of people don't.. which is too bad. It is such a nice message.
They have so many songs it is hard to keep track of them all.
Well I do see your point. Do you know when I'm 64?
I do know that. I enjoy it very much.
Ya it is a cute one. Kind of on the short side though.
I never noticed if it is. I will say the lana del rey song young and beautiful song lyrics make me think back to When I'm 64.
Never made that connection before but that is very true.
Yes same them, will you still love me when... I am old.
