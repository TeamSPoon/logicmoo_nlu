When you were younger, did you ever listen to Britney Spears or Nsync?
All the time when I was in school!
The boyband era was something else, it makes me laugh now when I hear the music.
Me too, I used to like Backstreet Boys a lot!
I did not like them as much as Nsync, even though they did sound similar.
There was this battle between Nsync and Backstreet Boys.
Yes, my friend was all about one band and I was all about the other.
Didn't Britney Spears used to date Justin Timberlake from Nsync?
Yes she did, this was a long time ago though.
They made a cute couple, but did they ever duet together?
That is a good question, I am unsure if they sang together or not.
I am going to have to look that up, now I am curious.
Do you ever listen to it now?
I have not heard any of their old songs in many years.
It has been quite a long time for me as well.
I remember the music videos were not half bad though.
Yeah I agree, I remember reading Justin TImberlake made fun of himself for the way he dressed in that boy band.
I heard that too, I think he is still a great artist.
He seems to be the only one out of those two groups who took off and made a career.
Yes, you never hear about any of the other members.
