So do you think Draco got a fair shake in the story?
You know, he was a spoiled brat but if you had to go to school with Harry Potter, it might be annoying.
Actually, I think Harry and I would have been friends.
Really? I don't know what house I would have been put in but those actors did not look like what I imagined compared to the books.
No? Snape was casted well and so was the first Dumbledore. Harry was okay...but Ron was supposed to have a long skinny nose.
Yeah, Hermione....don't get me started. Her hair was fake frizzy and it took me while to get used to her. Not what I imagined.
Me neither. I'm not sure Voldemort looked right either.
Yeah, it's not anything like what I imagined though I'm not sure what that was...given the description in the books.
Maybe more like the James Earl Jones in Conan the Barbarian?!?
Oh yeah, that would have been cool.
