Did you see the match between the Sharks and the Oilers?
Yea it was pretty close game with overtime!
Sharks won 3-2.
Totally agree. Melker Karlsson's wrist-shot goal at 3:22 of overtime gave the San Jose Sharks a win.
That was crazy! Let's look at some statistics.
Ok, well Cam Talbot made 41 saves for the Oilers.
While Sharks goalie Martin Jones stopped 17 shots, most of them in the first period.
For sure! Paul Martin and Joel Ward scored in regulation for the Sharks
Yup, while Oscar Klefbom and Milan Lucic scored for the Oilers.
What about the Blues vs Wild game?
That was a great game as well!
Goalie Jake Allen had a season-high 51 saves.
He is so good!
I agree completely. What about Sobotka?
Vladimir Sobotka scored in regulation for the St. Louis Blues, giving them a 1-0 lead in their best-of-seven series against Minnesota.
What was crazy was the Blues were less than a minute from winning in regulation, but Wild left winger Zach Parise's goal with 22.7 seconds left.
Yea! This forged a tie after Minnesota's first 43 shots had been turned aside by Allen.
I am still thinking about that game!
I also watched the Penguins vs Blue Jackets game. So good!
That was a good game with the Penguins having a 3-0 lead in the second period with goals from Bryan Rust, Phil Kessel and Nick Bonino. Evgeni Malkin added two assists which was crazy.
