What is your favorite series of Disney movies?
Pirates of the Caribbean, without a doubt.
Okay, is any particular one of the movies a favorite of yours?
I'd have to say that At World's End was my favorite of the Pirates movies.
Okay, why is that your favorite?
Because it has the most intense and wild ship battle.
Oh, when the Black Pearl and FLying Dutchman battle each other while circling the goiant whirlpool?
Yes, I love the action and the music is fantastic.
And of course, the sword fighting is excellent of course.
Yeah, I particularly like Barbossa performing Will and Elizabeth's marriage while in the midst of combat.
