So, any other films you've been wanting to see but haven't yet?
Yeah, a lot actually... I haven't had a chance to catch too many films of late.  For example, still haven't seen Hardcore Henry.
Hardcore Henry?  Don't think I've heard of that one.
Oh, it looks really cool!  It's about this guy who wakes up with no memory of his life but he's got a new cybernetically enhanced body and then his wife gets kidnapped by this evil guy and he's gotta fight through a whole bunch of guys to get her back.
Oh, so it's like a sci-fi action film then?
Yeah, but what's cool about it is the whole thing is shown through a first person view, kind of a like Doom or Quake.
That sounds pretty awesome.
Yeah, the guy who directed it did a seven minute music video with the same premise for this group called Biting Elbows and when they saw how well it turned out, he got contacted to do a film.
I'm gonna have to check that out myself.
Oh, yeah, it looks really awesome and funny to, cause there's a part in the trailer where he's kicking butt and they're playing Queen's "Don't Stop Me Now."
Ha!  I remember when they had that on Shawn of the Dead while they're beating that one zombie down with pool sticks!
That scene was comedy GOLD.
So, what else you been wanting to see?
Well, also been meaning to catch the film What We Do In the Shadows.
Wait, I think I've heard of that one.  Is that the one with vampire or something?
Yeah, it's got this guy who's become a new vampire and he has a documentary crew following him around filming him and stuff.
I remember seeing the trailer for that awhile back and it looked pretty funny.
I've heard it's gotten a lot of good reviews.
I think there was a scene where they confront of a group of werewolves and they're arguing and insulting each other and stuff.
Ha, wonder if that's a little inside jab at Twilight or something.
