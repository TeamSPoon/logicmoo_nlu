Do you like Aerosmith?
Yes
Their old stuff, or new stuff?
Old and new
I am not a big fan of their new stuff
Do you like the song "Crazy?"
That is one of the exceptions
I see. So, you don't hate all of their new stuff
Not all of it I guess
You have a point though. Their old stuff is amazing
I love Chip Away at the Stone
Me too
The drums are great in that song
They are the best rock band
Now that is up for debate
They really are. Name one that is better
The Rolling Stones
Good point
They have tons of great tunes
Let's listen to one
