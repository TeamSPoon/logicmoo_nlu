Have you seen any of the Pirates of the Caribbean movies?
Yes, just the first one.
They are playing Dead Men Tell No Tales in the theater.
Are you going to see it?
Not sure. It looks good.
Is Johnny Depp in it?
Of course.
How many pirates movie have there been?
There has been five of them.
Wow, i didn't know there was that many.
Yes. Well with Depp's character, they can keep going.
The first one was entertaining.
Jack Sparrow is a great character for a film.
I couldn't see anyone else playing him.
This movie is over two hours again.
They at least give you your moneys worth.
You should watch the other movies and catch up.
Maybe I'll see if they are all on Netflix.
Kevin McNally is supposed to play a good role.
Not sure who that is.
