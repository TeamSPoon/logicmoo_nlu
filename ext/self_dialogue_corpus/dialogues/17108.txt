Creative process is thus magic. that's what you;re telling me.
Um no. it's hardly magic. There is a method to the madeness.
Idon't even kniow why I even asked.
You asked becasue you want modern music that's as cool as atonal music.
Oh wait. Yes. This is true. So what you;re sayign is Debussy is as cool as Schonberg and I'll like it?
Um, no. I'm saying "I" like Debussy and and the reasons Ilike him are as we discussed.
Well, I don't think I'll like Debussy as nuch as you. Who else?
Who else... what?
Who else will i like?
"will" is an intention.
Yes....?
Who you "will" like deals with yout conscious intention to like someone's music.
Yes.... And?
Well, who do you intend on like?
What's what I ASKED!!!!!!
This conversation is highly unproductive.
Tell me more about this modernism.
See, I find the term modernism kinda of objectionable. But anyway, There are many composers who fall i this categories and whose musics are really increadible,. so it really depends on what you gravitate towards.
That's another big word for you. Gravitate.
... Atonality was the biggest discovery in the modern era in my opinion. Others include neoclassicism where they tried to reinvent the classical era into fitting the modern sensibilities which was quite successful in my opinion. think Stravinsky.
