Who is your favorite rap artist?
I love Ludacris!
He's great isn't he?  I love "What's your Fantasy?"
I also like Little Wayne.  Hard to not want to dance around listening to him.
His song "Lollypop" is one of my favorites.  I always play it on my iPod.
How do you like Biggie?
He was so good.  So tragic that he had to die. Him and Tupac both!
I like that Puff Daddy wrote a song for Biggie.
Do you prefer the old school rap or the new stuff that's out there?
Both are good...I'm probably 50/50.
