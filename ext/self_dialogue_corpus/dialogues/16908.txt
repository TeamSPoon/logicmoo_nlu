Do you ever listen to The Black Keys?
Not too much. I've only heard their radio stuff.
They're not bad you should check them out.
I've heard they're not too band.
They sound like an indie rock band.
I hear a lot of those nowadays.
Yeah but the Black Keys have a little blues mixed in.
Oh wow that sounds pretty good.
Yeah I really like their first album.
Why is that?
It sounds like more blues rock music.
Is it a lot slower?
Some of the songs. You can really feel the music.
That sounds really interesting.
I think you could get into them.
Okay I'll have to check them out.
I think you can find their stuff on spotify.
Oh nice I'll see what I can find.
Let me know what you like!
I definitely will!
