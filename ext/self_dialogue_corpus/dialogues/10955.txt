I can't believe that the Blues got elimated!
Yeah it was yet again, another depressing end to an amazing season.
I so miss the days of the Russian defense!
Oh yeah, back when Hull & Oates were the kings of ice.  Who was your favorite from that time?
Well, you can't bleed blue without CuJo!  Curtis Joseph, best goalie we've ever had!
Shoot, I remember going to the OLD games at the Checker Dome.
Yeah, thats when hockey was the best! Bernie was the man!
My favorite thing about hockey is the fact that you've got basically every sport mixed in to one!
I hear you there!
You've got boxing, wrestling, speed skating, soccer, a twisty kind of football.  There's no better sport!
I've never thought of it that way, you're right!
Have you heard if they're going to pass the measure to update the Savvis Center?
I really dont know, but i sincerely hope so.  We are definitely a hockey town & we need to make sure our boys have a decent home to play in!
So are you keeping up with the playoffs still?
Yeah, a little bit.  I usually watch till the Blues are out.
Too bad we still don't have Sir Stanley's Cup to show off like the major trophies of our other sports teams
