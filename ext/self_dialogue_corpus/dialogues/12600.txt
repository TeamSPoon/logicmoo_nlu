Which side would you be on in the Star Wars movies?
I would be with the Rebel Alliance of course.  You?
I would too and not only that, I would have jedi skills.
I would fly the Millenium Falcon.
With Han Solo!  Hey, what do you think about the new movie about him they are making?
I hope it will be done right.  They need to use old school Star Wars stuff and not this new movie ideas.
InIIn that Star Wars Movie where he died I watched the lead girl and she,without any training at all, could fly ships and fight with light sabers.
I know! That made no sense at all!
Luke had to be trained and in real life anyone would need training.
That's why I say they need to use old school Star Wars movies ideas.
