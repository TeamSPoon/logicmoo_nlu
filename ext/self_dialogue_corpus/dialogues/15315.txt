What's your favorite music to work out to at the gym?
I use a Japanese song during my fartleks.
I'm sorry, your ... fartleks?
Yes.
What's that?
it's the Swedish term for interval running. I go back and forth between 7.0, 8.0, 7.1, 8.1, every few minutes.
So what's the song and why do you use it?
It's the theme from Attack on Titan.
Which? There are three.
Right, I forgot they switched the music halfway through season 1.
I prefer the original.
I love the music to the original and season two the most.
Why do they let you run that interval?
It's short and intense, so I only have to run a specific speed for a few minutes.
Got it, sounds good.
I also like pretending I'm fighting in the universe.
Ha, you're ridiculous. But if it helps you run.
I just wish I knew the lyrics.
Yeah I've looked them up but can't remember them.
The way they depict them falling off the cliff in Season 2 is beautifully-set. The music slows down as they fall.
