What do you think is the best sport of all time?
probably football
really, you like soccer
no silly I mean good old american football
oh lol sorry I thought you mean football like kicking the white and black ball around
Nah that is great for people overseas but I like my good old fashioned full contact NFL
Yeah me too really love to watch the NY Giants
Oh no doubt Eli Manning is a great quarterback
Yes and the team is a good role model as a whole
yup the Bengals could learn a thing or two from the GIants
I know, did you see that Pac man Jones was arrested again?
Honestly?
Yeah I think either a DUI or fighting in public
Not sure why these millionaires have to still act like thugs
I guess you can take them out of the bad ends of town but still cannot get the thug out of them
I blame the coach
Yeah Marvin Lewis is a real pushover
Ha you can say that again
Marvin Lewis is a real pushover
I didn't mean that literally you dofus
