What is your opinion of Lady Gaga?
Am I a fan you ask?
Yes, are you a fan?
I wouldn't say I'm a fan but some of her music is okay.
I like some too. I'm having a hard time remembering the names of her songs though.
I like her song "Poker Face". I listened to that over and over.
That was actually really good I remember that song!
I think she's kind of different though.
I know, she does like a little strange.
Not bad music though.
