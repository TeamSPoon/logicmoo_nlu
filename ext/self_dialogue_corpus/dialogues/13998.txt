Did you ever get to listen to Lady Gaga's album Born this Way?
I didn't get to purchase that one.  How was it?
It has some amazing songs on the album.
Which are you favorites?
Marry the Night, Judas, and Born This Way are some great songs on it!
I think that album came out in 2011 under  Interscope Records.
Just Dance is my favorite album, that came out in 2008.
Yes the whole album is that remixed!
I know! Too funny!
I think she got some awards for it as well.
