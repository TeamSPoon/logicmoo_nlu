Hey
Hey, how are you?
Good
Do you listen to eric church
Yes, he's a great entertainer.
I'm listening to around here buzz.
I like that one
It's a pretty good song
What about Luke bryan?
Love him
I saw him in concert once
Was it amazing?
So amazing
I need to go next time he goes on tour
It's completely worth it
I bet it is
And the ticket prices are reasonable.
I saw him on the voice as an advisor
Me too he's so funny.
I love his personality
