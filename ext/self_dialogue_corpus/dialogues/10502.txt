What's your favorite movie?
That's tough! Do you have one.
I actually don't think I do, now that you mention it.
Yeah, I definitely don't have one favorite, but could pick one favorite from each category.
Good idea- let's start there! What's your favorite comedy?
I like the classics. Planes, Trains and Automobiles is definitely one.
Good choice! Have you seen Due Date? It's kind of an unofficial remake
It is? I've never seen it. Sounds awesome!
Zach Galifinakis from the Hangover is in it.
He's absolutely hilarious, I'll have to check it out! What's your favorite comedy?
Now that we're on the subject, probably Due Date actually!
Ok, I definitely have to see this movie now.
I can lend it to you if you want- I have it on DVD!
Sounds great! I'll lend you another one in return.
Sweet!
Actually a movie swap sounds like a great idea.
It does!
Let's get a group together and make this an event!
My roommates all loe movies, I'll mention it to them.
Sweet!
