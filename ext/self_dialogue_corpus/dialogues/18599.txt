What do you think of Arcade Fire
I really like Suburbs
I thought it was good but kind of boring
I can that. maybe overhyped
For sure
Do you like Wolf Parade?
Eh, they seem like hipster music
I can understand that.
I like TV on the Radio.
They're not hipster music, just good music
Yeah Wolf Like Me is a great song.
And Ambulance too.
I liked the Cold War Kids before they got radio famous
Yes Hang Me up to Dry is a good song
I liked the shins way back when
They had some good love songs
The Decemberists too had some good songs.
I liked Barrow Boy.
It was experimental type stuff for sure
I guess. More just weird lyrics.
