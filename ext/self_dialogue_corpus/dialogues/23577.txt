So I recently saw the new Guardians of the Galaxy movie.
Really? I've heard good things about that movie, but what did you think?
I thought it was amazing! All around a really great movie.
I can believe that. Marvel are usually at the top of the game when it comes to superhero movies.
Totally. Nobody does superhero movies like Marvel. They just know how to tell a good story with good characters with awesome visual effects.
It's too bad, because DC does at least one of those pretty well, but everything else is all over the place.
People tend to blame Zack Snyder for that.
Who's he, again?
He's the director.
Oh, right. Wait, did he direct Suicide Squad?
No, and people thought it would be a good movie because of that.
I thought it was an alright movie.
Me too, but they could have done so much more with it.
I agree. Leto's Joker was such a disappointment.
I thought it had potential, especially since he had a really unique look, at least for the Joker.
All of that potential was ruined whenever they decided to give him literally 5 minutes of screen time.
Did you think he could top Ledger's Joker?
Are you kidding me? Nobody can top Ledger's Joker!
I thought as much. That's still one of my all-time favorite performances in any movie.
Mine too!
