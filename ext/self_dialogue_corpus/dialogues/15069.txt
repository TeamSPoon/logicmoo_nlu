Have you seen any good comedies recently?
I just recently saw a movie called Shaun of the Dead, have you heard of it?
No, what's that?  It sounds scary.
It's a parody of the movie Dawn of the Dead, are you familiar with it?
Yes, I think I've seen that one.  Who's in Shaun of the Dead?
It stars Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright.
Oh, I'm familiar with Simon Pegg.  He was in the Star Trek movies?
Yes he was, but he's much better in his comedic roles.  What about you?  Have you seen any comedies lately?
Yes, I just saw the new Lego Batman movie, it's hilarious for both adults and kids.
I saw that one too, they really pushed the boundraries with that one.
