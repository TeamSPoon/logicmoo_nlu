Can you imagine a world where denzel washington did not do action
That would be a crazy world
Yeah it would
It would be a world that was nowhere near as good
I know he is funny but He is the bomb in action
I know it would not be the same
I love him in Django unchained
He is amazing in  that
One of his best
Easily the best
