I don't like rap.
Why not? There are a lot of great rap songs.
Rap is just a bunch of thugs promoting misogyny and capitalism.
There's certainly a lot of that, especially on the radio.
I heard this song the other day on my way to work, and it has to have been the stupidest song I've ever heard.
What was it?
I don't know who it was by, but the rapper was talking about taking an Uber everywhere.
Oh I think I know what song you're talking about. It's by Madeintyo.
It is idiotic and a prime example of why I think rap is trash.
That song is definitely silly. Especially when he goes "skrrt skrrt!"
Yeah I laughed really hard and couldn't believe it was a real song.
Not all rap is like that though.
Yeah right. If it's not about fast cars, it's about sex or gang fighting.
Rap gets much more complex than that. You'd be surprised what kind of stuff rappers talk about sometimes.
Like what?
Take Joey Bada$$ for example. He has some really powerful and thoughtful lyrics.
Didn't he do that song "Devastated"? That song is fun but not necessarily meaningful.
Yeah, but that's his radio hit. You need to listen to some of his other stuff.
Okay, I'll take your word for it.
A lot of people think rap is a monolith but it's really not. I'll send you some links to good rappers.
