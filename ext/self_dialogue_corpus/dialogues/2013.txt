do you think there was a good draft this year?
I think there is a good draft every year.
Why is that?
Because there are always some people taken in the late rounds who end up surprising everyone. Those are the best.
Oh? Like who?
Well, for example, in the 2000 draft there were 6 quarterbacks drafted before Tom Brady.
So?
So, he wasn't taken until the 6th round and look at him now.
Yeah, I guess that's pretty impressive.
You never know who is going to turn into a great player.
So you love every draft?
Yeah, That's a possibility for every year.
But a lot of times it's the first picks that count.
not always, Sometimes players picked in the first few picks end up being a bust.
Yeah, like who?
Ryan Leaf. He was drafted 2nd overall by the chargers in 1998.
So?
His career ended in 2001. And he ended up in prison eventually.
Wow, that's crazy.
You never know what you're really getting from your draft picks.
