Have you seen the new Beauty and the Beast yet?
I finally saw it and thought it was really good. I loved the music.
Ya I really liked how they portrayed the Bell character.
She was probably my favorite character in the movie. I didn't really like The Beast though.
Ya I felt his character was lacking depth.
I kind of found him boring and thought he looked a little strange.
Ya I see what you mean I liked the cartoon beast better.
I did really like the other characters.
I liked how there was more back story of everyone else in the castle.
Ya like Miss Potts how you see her husband.
