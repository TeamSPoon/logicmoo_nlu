Are you ready for the upcoming NFL season?
Yes I cannot wait until this NFL season starts
Do you think Jarvis Landry will get a contract extension before the season starts?
The Miami Dolphins need to make sure they sign him if they want to win games against those Patriots
What's your favorite team?
My team is anyone not names the Patriots
Yes I agree they have had their time in the spotlight but what a dynasty they have built
I would agree with you if they hadn't had so many cheating scandals
Do you honestly think any other team has a chance to win the superbowl this year besides the Patriots?
I can see the Oakland Raiders beating the Patriots if Derek Carr stays healthy.
Yeah if Beastmode comes back to his Seahawk days of old and runs people over.
I agree he is the ultimate wildcard on that team. Have you seen him training on the beach?
I have and have you ever tried beach football?
No. What do you think about the Carolina Panthers?
I think they only go as far as Cam Newton allows them to go.
But that defense is still elite.
I like the Pittsburgh defense better personally
Yes James Harrison is still a beast
My favorite defender in the league is Cam Wake though.
He is ageless and seems to only get faster each year.
