Did you know the Lion King came out the year I was born in 1994?
No, I did not know that. Did you here they are making a live action remake of it?
Yes, and I am not sure how I feel about that. It was always one of my favorite Disney shows.
I always liked Timon and Pumbaa. They were so funny.
I must have sang Hakuna Matata so much, it drove my parents crazy.
That was my favorite song of the whole show. I was always sad though when Mufasa died.
I could not believe his own brother, Scar, killed him.
Then poor Simba thought he was the one that killed his father.
Yes, but if not for that, he would never have met up with Timon and Pumbaa.
They do make the whole show so funny.
