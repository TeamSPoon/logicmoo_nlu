I wonder what the best movie ever made was.
Most people say Citizen Kane.
And I say no way.
Have you even seen it?
No, I don't like old movies.
Some of the best movies are old though.
Yes, but I've been raised on color TV, quick cuts, and constant action. I can't go back to the slow, talky-talky films of yesteryear.
Come now, we still get slow talky-talky films now and then. Tarantino makes plenty.
Ah, but you see, his films also contain action. It's not all dialogue.
But it's a big part of it.
Yeah, but movies are more than just talking. If I wanted to watch someone talking non-stopped I'd watch a vlog.
You might be partially right. Movies are the whole package.
What do you mean?
The lighting, the editing, the dialogue, the composition. There's an art to everything in film.
You sound pretentious. I just like me some explosions, okay?
I'm not disagreeing with you. Michael Bay films are some of the most amazingly edited movies ever made, in fact.
I thought critics hated Michael Bay movies?
As far as plotting and characterization goes, they're not always great. But his action set pieces and the way they're put together are masterful.
Huh, I never thought about that. Maybe I should look a little deeper into movies now and then.
You should. Film-making is an interesting art.
