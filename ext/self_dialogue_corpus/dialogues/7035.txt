Did you like Toy Story?
It was different
It was creative
I thought Buzz was pretty dumb
Yeah
It's kind of like he just got activated after leaving his box
You would think he would have been conscious while on the shelf and realize that he was not a space man
Toys in the store were alive
It was the first animated film I saw
I think it was the first animated film made
