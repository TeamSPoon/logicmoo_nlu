Going to any upcoming shows
Yeah I got tickets for Interpol
Is that for the Turn On The Bright Lights 15 year anniversary show
Yeah‚ I was surprised it sold out so fast
Yeah me too
It's funny cos I saw them when they toured the first time‚ hard to believe that was 15 years ago
Yeah‚ it's a really good album though
Yeah I don't think they ever topped it to be honest
I agree‚ their best work to date for sure
I do like Antics as well though
Have you heard any of the Banks & Steelz stuff?
No‚ what is that
That's Paul Banks from Interpol with RZA from Wu Tang Clan
Oh really‚ what style is that?
It's kind of like alternative rock / rap.
Is it any good.
I really like it‚ a few of the songs are really‚ really good
Maybe I'll check it out.
You should listen to the tracks "Giant" and "Wild Season"
I will‚ thanks for the tip
