Did you see the last Star Wars movie?
Yes, I did. It was cool.
I saw it on opening night.
I didn't, I had to work so I went the next day.
Yeah, it can be overrated to see it on opening day. It's so crowded.
That's what I think too. I'd rather stay away from the crowd.
Mark Hamill sure looks older.
Of course he does, look how old he is! He's 65.
Are you going to watch the next one?
I most certainly am!
I'm not sure when it's coming out. Do you know?
I think it's May 24, 2019.
Oh bummer, I was hoping it was going to be this year.
I thought I heard it was supposed to be, but I guess not.
How old were you when you watched the first movie? I was 7.
I think I was around 8 years old.
All the Star Wars movies are good in that they are pretty much for all ages.
Yeah my Mom didn't let me watch a lot of movies, but she let me watch Star Wars.
May the Force be with you!
You too dude, catch you later.
