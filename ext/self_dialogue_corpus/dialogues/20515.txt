I always tease my sister about this part of The Lord of the Rings: Two Towers.
Which part?
The part when Legolas misses the torch running orc.
Which scene is that? I don't remember exactly.
You know. The scene where Aragorn and the group gather to defend Rohan from the orc army.
Oh, that part. Legolas was under a lot of pressure in that scene. Aragorn was yelling at him an all.
That's the excuse my sister uses. That and bad writing.
Legolas managed to hit that orc once, though.
In the shoulder and it was too late to stop it by then.
You just don't like that elf.
He wasn't my favorite character in the movies. My favorite character was killed off in Fellowship of the Ring.
Gandolf?
No, silly. Boromir.
The guy that attacked Frodo over the ring?
He came to his senses after that.
I have to give the guy props for lasting as long as he did with all those arrows in him.
That's why I like his character the most. He put up a good fight.
What about his brother, Faramir?
I don't think he was as tough as Boromir.
Maybe not.
