This game is a shoe-in.
Don't say that, man.
It is!
My team is behind, but we'll catch up soon!
You guys are done!
We're the Eagles! We fly!
Then fly to that touchdown.
Oh, we will.
I'm sure.
Give it one more quarter!
You need that?
You guys are up by 5, so yes.
Did you bet on this game?
I sure did!
You might wanna recoup your bet.
Really?
Not looking good for you.
Alright.  Let's get Tommy on the field.
He can't save y'all!
Oh the pessimism.
