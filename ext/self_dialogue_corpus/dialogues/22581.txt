What do you feel like watching tonight?
Let's see, I've got a backlog of movies about a mile long.
Me too. Did you see John Wick 2?
Yeah, I did, it was awesome!
I want to see that one. The first one was so good.
If you liked the first one, you'll like the second one.
OK, so we won't watch that one. What about 'Logan'?
Sorry, I've seen that one too.
What did you think?
It was really solid too. You should watch it - it's really violent.
OK, so Logan is out too.
Sorry man. What about The Witch?
The Witch? Never heard of it.
It's a horror suspense movie. I've been wanting to see it for a while.
Is it gory?
I don't know; I've heard it's more of a slow burn.
OK, let's give it a shot.
Nice! Are you a fan of scary movies?
Yeah, I dig them.
Let's go!
