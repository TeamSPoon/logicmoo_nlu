Are you excited to repeat this year.
Yes, Brady is going to get his sixth.
That is the same amount the Jordan won.
Yes, but it is harder to win in the NFL, so many more players.
Yes, he's already the greatest, this will just add to his legacy.
Really cool to have been able to see him play too.
Definitely something to talk about to the grand kids.
Do you think we can go undefeated this season?
I don't think so, I think we will get above 12 wins, but we will not go full throttle if we lock up the conference.
Yes, better to go into the playoffs healthy.
Yep, it matters what we do in the post season, not going undefeated and losing the game when it matters most.
Still remember that season, we looked unstoppable.
Well that did not end how we though it would.
I think we've learned greatly from that, but Brady will be 40 this season as well.
It is crazy how long he has sustained this level of play.
Yeah, at this rate he will be playing till 50.
As long as he plays at a elite level he can play as long as he wants.
That's funny, I also really hope we keep Jimmy so we have that heir apparent.
Yes, that should be a priority.
Well let's go and repeat!
