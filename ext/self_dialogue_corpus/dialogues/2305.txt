So have you been to any NFL games?
I've been to a couple, mostly for the Green Bay Packers
Who did they play?
The Chicago Bears
Who won?
The packers of course! The bears are terrible
Yeah that makes sense. Was it enjoyable?
Yeah it was fun, a little cold though
I think the Packers play better in cold weather
They definitely do
They play most of the time in cold weather
They are fun to watch as long as its not too cold
Sometimes I hear that if you buy a beer at some games it will freeze solid before you can finish it
Yeah that happened to me one time
What do you do about it?
You drink the beer really fast
I bet that makes the game more fun to watch
Yeah if you wear like 20 layers
I love going to NFL games
Me too, they are a great atmosphere!
