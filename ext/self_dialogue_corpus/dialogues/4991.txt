So, have you gone to any baseball games lately?
I'm not a huge baseball fan, but yeah. I went to a couple of spring training games out in Arizona this year.
Oh, fun. Is that the Cactus League? I went there once.
Yep,it sure is. I think that is baseball at its best.
So who did you see play?
I saw the Chicago Cubs play the Cincinnati Reds and the Kansas City Royals play the White Sox.
Great fun.So who won?
Uh, actually I don't remember. I follow the Detroit Tigers mostly,so I really wasn't rooting much for one over the other.
Ha ha. So what did you really do there?
Talked with my sister; ate hot dogs; played on my iphone; got some sun.
Well, speaking of the Tigers... you want to go to a game with me this fall?
Sure, that would be fun. Shall we get a group together, or just the two of us?
Oh, the more the better. But you will have to watch the game.
I can do that. Sometimes its kinda fun to watch.
Have you been to Tiger Stadium before?
Once. Well,once to the new stadium; and once years ago to the old stadium.
What do you think?
Well, I get the nostalgia for the Old stadium, but I have to say the new one is pretty spectacular.
Yeah, me too. Maybe we can go to dinner first.
Alrighty, sounds good. Looking forward to it.
