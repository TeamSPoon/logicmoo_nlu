Hey football season is coming up, are you excited?
Yes I love the NFL
Who is your favorite team?
I like the Chiefs but thats only because I grew up in Kansas City.
Yeah im that way with the patriots since i grew up in Boston.  Id rather they win but im not super upset if they lose.
You have Tom Brady though, one of the greatest quarterbacks of all time so that has to feel good!
Yeah, its nice but hes not everything.  Its the rest of the team that help make them good.
I think its interesting how the NFL is so focused on quarterback play and passing now.
Yeah i agree, back in the 80s and 90s it was good to have a strong running game, but now theres something like 13 quarterbacks who threw for over 4000 yards last season.
Yeah, look at Eli Manning, hes thrown for over 4k for the last 4 years and has two MVPs and two rings and people still disregard him..
Yeah theres just so much quality in the new guys like dak prescott.
I agree, dallas is going to be set if Dak can keep up with his current play.
Id rather have a good quarter back like rogers or stafford than none at all i suppose.
Thats for sure.  I feel bad for the teams like the browns who always are trying to find a new player.
Speaking of the browns, how do you think that RGIII will do with them.
I think he will fail just like he has in the past, hes just too frail to play in the NFL.
I think you might be right.  Kind of like Tony Romo, so much talent but just incident prone.
Yeah then theres guys like peyton manning who has his neck bones fused back together and somehow can come back to win a superbowl
Yeah, peyton is certainly an inspirational story.
Im glad he was able to get another ring.   I loved him with the colts.
