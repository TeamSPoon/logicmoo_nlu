Did you know they're making a third Cars movie?
No, I'm not even sure I remember seeing Cars 2.
I saw Cars 2, it was okay I guess, but not nearly as good as the first movie.
Yeah, the first movie was really original and funny.
So I wonder why they're doing another one?
Probably because they spent so much money on adding a Cars Land to Disneyland.
Oh, I heard about that. Isn't it supposed to be really realistic?
Yeah, the entire area is just like Radiator Springs from the movies.
Well then I can see them wanting to put out another movie to keep people excited.
It makes sense.  I wonder if the movie will be any good.
