I just found our old DVD's. We watched The Little Mermaid.
So you mean the kids movies?
Yes, all the Disney movies. I love Sebastian.
He is a great character.
Ariel is a pretty Disney character.
Yes, she is. Don't like the big lady in the sea though.
I know. Ursella, is her name.
There is a lot of good songs in that movie.
I like the Under the Sea song.
Me too. It sticks in your head.
