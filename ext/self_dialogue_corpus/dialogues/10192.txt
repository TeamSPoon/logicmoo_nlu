What was better, John Wick or John Wick 2?
That's a tough decision.
I would go with the second just because of the higher body count.
True, but the first had a better story.
I would agree with you there since they killed his dog.
The second had the better action pieces though.
It's a tough call either way; you really can't go wrong.
I'll be really looking forward to the third one coming out?
They're making another one?  Awesome!
Yep, another couple years, but will be special!
