Let's watch a good thrilled tonight.
Ok, how about Eye for an Eye?
What's that about?
A woman seeks revenge on her daughter's killer.
Who is in it?
Sally Fields and Kiefer Sutherland.
Oh that sounds good.
It's a fantastic film. I think you'll like it.
Is Kiefer a bad guy?
Of course. His best roles are bad guys.
I know. I loved him in Stand By Me and The Lost Boys.
I loved to hate him in those films.
He's so good at playing bad.
He was great in 24 though too.
Yeah definitely. He's just a phenomenal actor.
I think Eye for an Eye is one of his best though.
Well I'm sold.
It's almost hard to watch but it's so good.
Sally Field is so believable in everything she does.
Yeah this is no exception.
