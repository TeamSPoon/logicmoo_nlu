So who don't you like?
For me that's easy.........the Pats. and the 9'ers.
Tell me why.
I don't like the 9'ers specifically because I grew up a Bengals fan.
What does that have to do with anything?
Well the Bengals played in 2 Superbowls in the 80's and lost to the 49'ers both times on basically the last play of the game.
That sucks.
Yes it sucks, that's the main reason I despise the 49'ers.
The Bengals had some good teams back in the 80's.
Yes they did. Kenny Anderson and Boomer Esiason were great quarterbacks.
So why the Patriots?
First off they cheat, Belichick cheats and Brady is just too darn smug.
That Hernandez dude used to play for them also.
Yes, and look what he did to others and himself.
Yeah, but you can't put that on the organization.
Why not? Even his teammates in college at Florida were afraid of him, stayed away from him.
He was a really bad dude wasn't he?
Yes, the dude murdered at least two people.
Belichick is one heck of a good coach though isn't he? He wins.
I will not say that because they have been caught cheating on multiple occasions.
