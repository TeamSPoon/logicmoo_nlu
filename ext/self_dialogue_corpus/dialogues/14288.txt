Are you watching the Celtics/Cavaliers series.
I am, the Celtics are getting killed!
I know, when is the next game?
I think it's tonight.
Is it in Cleveland or Boston?
I think this one is in Cleveland.
I hope the Celtics can win at least one.  It's a boring series if they don't.
I agree I hate when one team dominates the whole series.
LeBron is tough to beat and has been all over the Celtics.
He has been a nightmare for them.  They can't stop him.
Too bad for Boston that they lost the games where they had home court advantage.
That was their best shot and unfortunately they blew it.
I hate to say it but I think Cleveland will sweep.
I don't know, I think Boston still has some life in them.
I hope you are right, I want to at least see Cleveland challenged.
Me too, I don't want this series to be too easy for them.
If the Celtics can figure out their offense they will have a shot.
They also have to make sure the defense is flawless
Well I guess we will see tonight.
Yup, should be a great game.
