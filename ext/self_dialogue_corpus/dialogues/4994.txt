Okay, know what bothers me about baseball?
*Sigh* You're always ranting about something with the game you pretend to love.
I rant because I'm passionate about it. Anyway, I hate the Little League World Series.
Of course you do. Why does it bother you?
It's the most pretentious thing in the world. It's not a series in any form whatsoever.
How so?
Well, it's two tournaments. The US teams, and "the others."
The sounds racist ...
Well, think about it. If it was truly a world series, the US champion would enter a field of all country's champions.
What is it now, I'm unfamiliar.
Well, here the champion of the other countries plays the champion for the US, and then they play a title game.
Oh, I see. It's not even a series. It's one game.
Precisely! It's also insulting to assume the US team automatically either wins or gets second place.
When in reality, if they entered the field, they could be eliminated after just two games.
Right. By hosting the tournament, the US automatically gets into the title game.
That's pretentious, but if we host the game, why won't we get an automatic bid?
Because that's poor sportsmanship.
I have a better explanation.
No you don't, but you may try.
If the US lost in the first round, no one would be at the games. These kids come from poor countries; their parents can't fly in.
