Ready for the season?
Yes! Waiting to see who takes over in the NFC North
DO you think the Bears have a chance after trading everything for a QB?
Not really, the guy isn't that good.
Are you worred about the packers?
as long as Rodgers plays, yes
I think the Vikings can take the Packers this year
They will have the defense to do it
Yea, and I think the Lions are still out
Without CJ, I think Stafford is still a bit lost
And they cant play defense
No, that doesnt help.
Who do you think will win it all this year?
I think the patriots are still contenders.
Brady is probably the best QB of all time. SO I wouldnt be surprised
I hope he DOESNT win just to give others a chance
Yea, gets boring to watch after a while
Are you going to a preseason game?
I hope to, not sure which one
Let me know and I'll try to join you
