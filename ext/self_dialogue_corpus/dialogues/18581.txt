How come we haven't heard anything about Empire of the Sun for a while?
They released "Two Vines" last year. That had a remix of Walking on a Dream.
Yeah. All of a sudden I was hearing that song on the radio again.
They also released High and Low, but that didn't do as well as Walking on a Dream.
What do they call that kind of dreamy music?
I think that it's called Electro Pop, Dance. I've even heard it called glam because of the makeup and outfits that they wear.
Luke Steele is kind of the most dramatic with the costumes and makeup.
His costume is called Ming the Merciless robe. I've never heard that headpiece referred to as anything but steel headpiece.
They had another hit, but I can't remember the name.
You're probably thinking about "Without You." It wasn't as popular.
For Two Vines, they worked with other well-known artists.
Right. David Bowie, Lindsey Buckingham from Fleetwood Mac and a singer that worked with Prince.
Have you heard about anything that they might have coming up?
I could be wrong, but I think that their last concert was in 2015.
I heard that their costumes were influenced by a film maker.
Absolutely. Alejandro Jodorowsky, the surrealist and his Holy Mountain. They said that is the inspiration for their costumes.
And their song was used in a commercial.
Again -- Walking on a Dream. It was used in a promotional advertisement for the Honda Civic in 2016.
I always thought that video was interesting.
FYI, It was filmed by Josh Logue in Shanghai.
