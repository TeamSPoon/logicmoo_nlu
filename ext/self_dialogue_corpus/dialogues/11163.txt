How's your dress making business going?
Surprisingly it's going OK. I've had five orders this month.
You designed that black and white one June wore to the prom, right?
Yes. I got the design idea from one I saw on an awards show.
That one was beautiful.
Thanks. It was a little hard to do the skirt with all those ruffles and such but I loved how it turned out.
It was really beautiful. I've been thinking of ordering something for myself to wear to a fancy charity event I have to go to.
We can do that any time you'd like.
The thing is I know the color I want but that's it.
I can help you design it, though, any time.
I also want lace. i love lace.
That's no problem either. What color were you wanting?
A soft pink I think.
You'd look so great in that.
With either white or a darker pink lace.
I have both colors of lace right now.
I'm pretty excited about this now.
Want to start designing it now?
Absolutely.
OK. Let's go through patterns and do that then.
