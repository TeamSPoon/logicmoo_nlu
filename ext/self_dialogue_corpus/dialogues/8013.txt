You know any Rnb girl groups who held their on own on the Pop music charts?
In the sixties it was the Supremes who had hits on both Rnb and Pop Charts.
What about in the seventies?
I would say the Emotions held their own in both Pop and Rnb. Remember Boogie Wonderland?
What you got for the eighties?
Was TLC eighties or nineties?
TLC was early nineties and so was Blackstreet. You remember them?
Who could forget TLC's "Creep" and Blackstreet's "If you love me?"
In the 2000s there was the Pussy Cat Dolls with "Don't You Wish Your Girlfriend Was Just Like Me."
That was my jam. But they were not Rnb who crossed over to Pop. You gonna make me start breakdancing in a minute. (laughs)
