What's your favorite rock music genre?
I've always been partial towards anything fast and aggressive.
Couldn't agree more, thrash metal, punk, hardcore, just needs that edge.
Absolutely it needs to get near want to be moving, I guess punk would be my absolute favorite though.
Mine as well, what's your favorite all time punk band?
It would have to be The Misfits.
Walk Among Us has to be one of the more catchy albums I've ever heard.
It really is, a rare album I never tire of.
Did you get to Riot Fest for their reunion show?
I wish I had, but I'm optimistic that Danzig will play more shows with them, too much money to be made.
