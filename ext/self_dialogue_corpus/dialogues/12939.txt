Who's your personal favorite Star Wars character?
Me? I'd probably go with Darth Maul.
Why is that? I've always found him to be a bit bland.
I just really like the way he looks. He looks like such a cool character is all.
I guess so.
Enough about me, though. Who's yours?
Mine's Luke Skywalker. He easily has the most depth of any character in the series.
I'm actually a fan of the character purely because of Mark Hamill.
He's a fantastic actor, isn't he?
That, and he's also the voice of the Joker. The best of two worlds!
