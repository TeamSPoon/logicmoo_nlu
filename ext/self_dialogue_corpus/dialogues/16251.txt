Hey, I'm going to put some music on. What would you like to listen to?
Something mellow. Do you have any Brazilian music?
Sure. I have Caetano Veloso. How about that?
Great! Is it one of his most recent albums?
No. It's a greatest hits. Tons of good songs in there.
Cool. I actually am not following him closely anymore. I did when I was younger though.
Me too. I loved him. What about Gilberto Gil?
Him too. Classic Brazilian master.
But I really like younger Brazilian musicians too. Like Marisa Monte, Chico Cesar, Carlinhos Brown etc.
Oh! I love that album Tribalistas that Monte and Brown did together.
Oh yes! One of my favorite albums for a long time. Id' listen to it every day.
I just learned it's actually a Christmas music album, although I would have never been able to tell.
I know. So much cooler than the Christmas music I have to listen to when I'm at my mom's for the Holidays.
I used to love Chico Buarque as well, speaking about Brazilian musicians.
I know him less, but I've seen his name on compilations.
He used to be a huge star in Brazil. And like many of them back then had to go in exile.
Oh yeah. Caetano and his sister did that as well. What was her name again?
Maria Bethania.
Yes! That's it! I used to listen to her albums too.
What a voice she has, so deep and soulful.
