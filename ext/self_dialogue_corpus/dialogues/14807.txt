Did you ever see Kung Fu Hustle?
Is that like a Bruce Lee movie?
No, it's more of a comedy than a martial arts movie.
I'm not sure if I've seen it.
It's kind of a parody of Kung Fu type movies.
Oh, yeah, I think I've seen it.
Yeah, it's a few years old.
I want to say it came out like ten years ago.
Yeah, that sounds about right.
Yeah, I've seen it once or twice.
