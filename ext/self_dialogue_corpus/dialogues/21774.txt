I just watched all The Hobbit movies. I can't believe the same people were responsible for The Lord of the Rings!
It's kind of understandable, the movies did have a troubled production.
That doesn't make them more fun to watch!
I'm not saying it does, just that Peter Jackson sort of got a raw deal on them.
What're you talking about? If he didn't want to do the movies, he shouldn't have.
Originally Guillermo del Toro was supposed to direct, but it didn't work out so Warner Bros. called in Jackson.
He should've turned them down then.
Maybe so, but would you in his situation? Everyone was ready to go; there were jobs on the line.
I suppose it's nice that he took up the cause then, but the movies didn't turn out well anyway.
Still, that's more Warner Bros. fault again. Originally it was only supposed to be two movies, if you can believe that.
Two seems like a lot to begin with. Why did they split it into three?
Simple, really. The head honchos wanted more money.
You can kind of tell. For all the buildup Smaug gets, he only briefly appears in the second film, and is killed off like 20 minutes into the last one.
The movies are kind of weirdly paced. I think it's because they had to pull a lot of other material from The Silmarillion to pad it out.
And you don't think Jackson deserves some of the blame for that?
I don't know. If you watch The Making Of features, you can tell he was a guy who was laying down the tracks as the train right behind.
You're saying the production was so troubled he was mapping everything out only days or weeks ahead of filming?
Well, maybe not exactly like that, but something along those lines. It's really amazing the films came out as good as they did, honestly.
Maybe I was a little too hard on him, but still, some of the CGI in that looks really bad.
Yeah, like I said, the production was very troubled. Almost all of your complaints can be explained by that.
