Who do you think will go far this year and make it to the Super Bowl.
Well of course the Patriots.
I think the Seahawks will.
I do too.
I also think the Giants.
Yeah they are good.
I think the Steelers will make it in.
They are good.
Who else do you think?
I think the Atlanta Falcons may go all the way.
What about the Cowboys?
They had an awesome team last year.
I think they can maybe win it.
If Andrew Luck is healthy the colts may go far.
Hopefully they deserve a break.
I agree. They need to do better.
I think that the panthers will do better.
I hope so they let me down last year.
Me too.
We shall see.
