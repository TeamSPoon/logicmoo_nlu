Michael Cera is a good actor
He kinda feels out of place though
How
Becauses it like he got forced into it by accident
Nah he is awkward but not that awkward
Yeah he is
I mean have you seen him in scott pilgrim
No
He played it perfectly
What was that movie about
It was about him trying to get with this girl
Mmhmm
and he had to win her over in a different way
How was that
He had to defeat all her evil Exes
Sounds goofy
It was
hmmm
It was funny and cool though
Maybe i will watch it
