I wonder if there will be any good movies coming out this summer.
Me too. I know in previous years it seemed like there was usually a Transformer movie, or maybe a superhero movie.
Wait, isn't there a new Star Wars movie?
That actually came out several months ago. They're not doing one this summer.
I bet it will be more superhero movies and stuff like that.
Probably. I think that new Stephen King one might be coming out.
Oh, yeah, I think I heard about that. Which one is that?
I think it's called the Gunslinger or Dark Tower. It's based on one of his Dark Tower books.
He has had so many good stories that made for great movies.
I agree. I loved Shawshank Redemption.
Me too! That's one of my all-time favorite movies.
It starred Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins.
Morgan Freeman has been in so many films.
He has, and yet I can't think of a lot of movies I've seen with Tim Robbins.
Isn't that strange? He must have been in other movies, I'm sure.
He was. He was in some movie called The Secret Life of Words.
I think he also did a cameo in Anchorman.
Yep. Meanwhile Morgan Freeman has been playing roles like God.
Yes, that's right. Wasn't he God in movie with Jim Carrey.
Yes! Bruce Almighty.
