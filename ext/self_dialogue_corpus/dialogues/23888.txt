What's your favorite movie?
Inception
Why?
Well first, Leonardo di Caprio is my favorite actor. Second it's great
I've never seen. What makes it so great?
Well, the story is one of the most unique, and trippy experiences ever.
I saw that it had low reviews though. What's up with that?
The reviews are around 75-80% because I think a lot of people don't understand what's going on.
It's that complicated huh?
Yeah, it takes some mental energy. Some people would rather watch explosions.
What makes it so complicated?
Well inception is mostly about dreams and consciousness. It kind of exists in this dreamy world that's different.
Is it believable
Totally! What makes it so cool is you can immerse yourself into their world, and the stakes are high.
I might have to check out this movie.
Yeah. It's amazing. I recommend it watching it more than once. I've seen it 10 times
10 times?!?!
Yeah. And every time, I notice something new.
Awesome. I'll definitely check it out.
Nice dude.
