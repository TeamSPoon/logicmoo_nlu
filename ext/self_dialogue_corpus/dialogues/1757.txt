Hey are you ready for some football?
Heck ya when does it start?
Training camp is in a couple of months
I cant wait, seems like forever
I know, but shouldnt be here in too long
I especially cant wait for fantasy football
Me too I cant wait to beat you
Keep dreaming man Im the champ
Not for long
What do you think the steelers will do?
I think they will have a good year
Ben is coming back that is good
He does that every year I had no doubt
Think Le'veon will stay healthy this year
Ya i hope so hes our rock
AB is also a monster for us
I know best receiver in the league
Yes sir I concur
Are you ready for some football?
Give me a time machine so I can go forward to opening day
