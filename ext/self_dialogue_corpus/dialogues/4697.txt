I love Montreal.
They're good at fighting.
They're absurdly good at fighting.
They love to fight.
They love to kill.
Same.
They murder like nothing.
I mean, that's me.
Murder players.
They're good at short-games.
They're terrible at getting the puck.
They love to not get the puck.
They don't ever get it but when they do they kill.
Yeah, they love that.
They're actually terrible at play but they're amazing at fighting.
Haha, yeah.
They can't play hockey for garbage.
That's kinda true.
But they play fists like nothing else.
Of course.
