Do you have a favorite Disney movie?
When I was younger it was the Little Mermaid but now I really like Beauty and the Beast.
It's always been The Lion King for me. I watched it over and over when I was little.
That's definitely one of the best that's ever been made. But I love the Disney Princesses.
Nala is not enough of a princess for you?
You know what I mean, she's not considered a princess like Ariel or Belle.
Yeah, I know. I'm sure we can at least agree that we miss hand drawn Disney?
Absolutely. Those were the good old days.
Wait, I forgot about the amazingness of Frozen and Moana.
Oh yeah. Okay it's all great.
