So, Week 1.... Bucs VS Bengals.
Yes, looks like the Bucs have to hustle right out of the gate.
Hopefully not to much.
How so?
Well, last season the Bucs were 9 and 7 and the Giants were 11 and 5
True.
They got three games pre-season to get warmed up.
Who do they have to play?
The Dolphins first. They were 10 and 6 last season.
Ouch, slightly better.
Yes, and if they defeat Miami then they face the Bears. they were 3 and 13.
Man, that's Jacksonville stats.
Indeed. After the bears they face the Vikings. They were 8 and 8 last season.
Hmm.... so that a good workout.
Yes, they should be ready for the Giants in October.
My fingers are crossed.
Any black out games this year?
For the Bucs or in general?
For the bucs.
No. We may not get to see all of the Miami games tho. Jacksonville is always rare here in Tampa.
