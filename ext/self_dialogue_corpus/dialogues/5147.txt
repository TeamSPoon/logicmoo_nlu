Hi.
Hey.
How are you doing?
Well, you?
Not bad.
Good.  You into baseball?
I like baseball, sure.
Yeah same here.
Ever been to a ball park?
I have once, when I was a kid.
Oh cool, which one?
Went to Camden Yards.
Is that where the Orioles play?
Yeah that's right.  What about you?
I have been a few times.
Where?
Turner field.
That the braves?
Yep.
Cool.
