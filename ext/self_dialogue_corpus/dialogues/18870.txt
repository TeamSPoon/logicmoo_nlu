What do you think of the new SZA album?
I thought it was okay. What about you?
I thought it was alright... maybe it was overhyped.
Yes! I've been waiting for someone to say this.
Yep... I didn't actually like it. It feels like TDE just made her drop it.
Yeah, and I'm not too fond of the promiscuity on the album.
Yes, the Weekend song is something else!
Exactly! I'd be so hurt hearing that.
Yep, I don't think that's a proper thing to sing about.
Yeah, she should be more discreet with her... actions.
Exactly, I think that the production was good though.
Oh yes, definitely. And she can sing too.
Yes, I love her voice. It's just the lyrics that don't do it for me.
Maybe she's appealing to today's generation.
Yep... sex does sell.
You're right, especially with this generation and the music that they love.
I just feel like R&B is all about infidelity now.
Yes, that's the new trend.
Sad to see those good lyrics get replaced with this mess.
Yep, hope higher quality comes along.
