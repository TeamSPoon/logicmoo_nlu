Did you like the song Blackbird by the Beatles?
No I thought it was too slow.
Yeah I would agree with you, how about Help?
Yeah that song was too good.
I think they really worked on their instrumentation on that album.
When they recorded together the sound was better.
i cant believe they didnt always record together.
I think the fame got too some guys.
In what respect?
They couldnt stand one another by the end.
