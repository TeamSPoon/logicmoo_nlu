What obscure music do you like?
How do you define "obscure"?
Something I've never heard of.
Well, I certainly like Andrew Ridgeley.
Wow! I've never heard of him. What songs did he make?
He made "Shake" from "Son of Albert".
I've never heard of either. What's "Son of Albert?"
It's just an album by him.
Is it any good? I mean, does it have any value?
I don't think so. I don't like the songs personally. I went through a Ridgeley phase a while ago.
What do you remember from it?
"Hangin'" and "Shake." Those are the only songs I remember.
Is that a good thing?
It might be. The songs were really bad.
When was "Son of Albert" released?
I think it was released in 1990 on CBS records.
You still remember a lot about him!
Yes, I believe I will always remember the solo from "Hangin'".
Do you know anything about "Shake?"
No, I don't remember much.
