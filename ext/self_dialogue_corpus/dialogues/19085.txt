Have you heard of Tame Impala?
Tame who?
Tame Impala...they're an indie band.
No, haven't heard of them. What did they make?
Come on, you've probably heard of them before..
No, I'm serious, I haven't.
Okay, do you know The Less I Know the Better?
Um... no. Others?
What about Let it Happen.
No! Play a song for me.
Oh! The theme song from Atlanta, you know that.
Yes... oh, them!
Yes! Now you know?
Yep, they're great. Just didn't know their name.
I knew you were familiar with them. They'll be at Panorama performing.
Ooh, we should go.
We should, but you have to get more familiar with their music first.
You're right.
I'll send you some of their stuff.
Okay, thanks so much!
