I just saw this new movie the Pirates of the Caribbean, have you seen the others?
Yeah, one was my favorite.
Really? I liked two better.
Two was alright, how was the new one?
I thought it was quite awesome, there was a lot of action and of course our hero Johnny Depp.
I really don't like Johnny Depp much as an actor, I like the supporting cast more.
That's the first time I've heard that, have you seen him in anything else?
Yeah I saw him in the notebook and he had a good performance but everything else is subpar.
Oh, well the new one was good, you should see it.
Maybe, I might wait till it dies down a little, how many people were in the theatre?
It was completely packed with adults and kids.
Ah, I don't enjoy going to a movie with kids, I'll have to wait till its out a little longer.
Yeah, I usually go to Matinee's to avoid that.
Oh cool, they're cheaper as well.
Yeah, by almost three dollars. Why are movies $15 now a days?
I don't know, but it's a rip off.
I agree, that's why I usually wait for videos to come out on blu ray.
I do like blu ray, but I like watching movies on the big screen.
Yeah me too, but it's too loud in the theatre sometimes.
It can definitely get too loud.
