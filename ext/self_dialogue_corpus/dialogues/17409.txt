Who do you think was the best band of the 2000s?
Blink 182
What?! Are you crazy?
No man, they had some great hits.
I disagree. Pearl Jam was way better.
Weren't they more of a 90s band?
90s and 2000s.
What about The Killers
Yeah, they were pretty good. I guess they're still around
Yes. I also thought Coldplay was really good.
Do you mean is really good.
Well some of their recent work is not that great?
Yeah, you have a point there. What about Arctic Monkeys?
Oh yeah, they have some great ones.
Yeah, especially in the alternative rock genre.
Yeah, I also like Arcade Fire.
You could almost consider them a new band.
Well, they started in the early 2000s.
I see, but didn't really hit it big until recently.
Yeah, I guess they're more well known now.
