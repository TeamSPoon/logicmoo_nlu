Hey there!  I was just going to ask you if you've heard of Skylar Grey?
No, I haven't!  Who is that?
Oh my God, I love Skylar Grey!  She's my favorite vocalist and she also plays piano.
Oh, awesome!  What type of music does she play?
She mostly plays singer/song writer music but recently she does some Pop music too.
Cool, I think I'll check her out!
You should!  You should check out a video on youtube that she did, it's not a professional music video, it was shot in a motel apparently.
Wow, a motel?  Is is a low budget thing or something?
I'm not sure.  I head that Marilyn Manson actually recorded it and she sings a few of her songs mashed together.
Cool, I like some of Manson's music.  I'm not completely into it but I can respect it.
I do think you'll like Skylar Grey though, she wrote that popular song that Rhianna sings "Love the Way You Lie".
Wow, seriously?  I love that song!  That was written by Skylar Grey?
Yep!  One of the many reasons that I love her.  She writes her own music and even has written many popular songs preformed by others.
I will check her out then, maybe you could send me some of her youtube videos!
Yeah, sure!  I will definitely do that when I get home!
Thanks, man!  I am always looking for new music to listen to!  I'm interested in Skylar Grey now, you have piked my interest.
You can't go wrong with her music, there is a song for nearly all occasions and all moods.
You know I need music like that. I need to feel what I'm listening to and be in the mood for certain music.
You'll absolutely find something worth your while.  You could also check out music she released in her real name, Holly Brooke.
What do you mean?  Her name isn't Skylar?
