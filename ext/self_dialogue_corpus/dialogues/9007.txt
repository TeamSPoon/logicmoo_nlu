Were you ever a Nirvana fan?
Slightly. I never got into grunge.
Yeah, but they transformed the music industry.
I wouldn't go that far.
Really, the destroyed hair rock.
Well hair bands are on their way back?
I haven't heard that.
Well, I just went to a hair band tribute band the other night. It was rockin'.
Well a tribute band is something different. It's not a legitimate band.
I still think it's legit.
