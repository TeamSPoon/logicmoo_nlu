Did you see Rogue One?
Yes, that was awesome.  That blind guy was the best.
I liked him a lot.  He was funny, and so was that android.
Yeah, and the speical effects for Peter Cushing's face were amazing.
Tell me about it.  I also like how it basically ended at the first scene of A New Hope.
That was awesome.  And I was glad to see Darth Vader in it, even if only for a little bit.
Yeah, when that guy came to Vader's home and he choked him.
Good one liner.
But nothing was as cool as the Vader fight scene.
I know, he just plowed through them one after another like nothing.
