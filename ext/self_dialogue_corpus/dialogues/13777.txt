I just heard Lady Gaga's song The Cure on the radio!
Did you like it?  I am still a little on the fence about it.
I loved it!  Although I have to admit I had no idea it was her at first.
Yeah, her new sound showcases her voice a lot more.
I do like her more soulful sound, I'm glad she is trying something a little more deep.
I kind of miss her old stuff.  Born This Way was still pretty deep but a little more upbeat.
I guess that's true.  But I still like her slower stuff too.
I am kind of glad that she has toned down her crazy antics though and is focused more on her voice.
I disagree!  I miss her in meat dresses and grand entrances.
The days of Bad Romance were pretty entertaining.
