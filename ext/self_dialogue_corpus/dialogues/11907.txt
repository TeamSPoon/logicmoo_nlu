Do you ever listen to Paul McCartney?
I don't really care for any of his solo stuff or stuff with Wings.
What about with the Beatles?
Oh, sure.  I mean, it's Paul McCartney.
Did you know McCartney and Lennon wrote almost all of the Beatles songbook?
Yeah, they were one of the best songwriting teams ever.
Yeah, I agree with you there.
Didn't Michael Jackson buy their songbook years ago?
Yeah.  In the 90s, I think.
I wonder who owns it now.
