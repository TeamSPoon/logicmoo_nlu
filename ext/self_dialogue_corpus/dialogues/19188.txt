What's your favorite kind of music?
EDM for sure
Don't you think EDM is dying now?
No, I think that it's changing now though
What do you mean?
Well Electronic dance music has been all the hype. Do you agree?
I think it used to be, at clubs and parties.
Right, it's mostly party music. But EDM has been incorporated into pop music now, and is less "dancy."
Can you give me an example?
Yeah. Big DJ's like Tiesto, Calvin Harris, don't make it on the radio anymore. It's mostly pop, progressive, house music.
Oh like Tropical house, or Justin bieber's stuff?
Really anything on the radio uses a more mellow EDM. So I wouldn't say EDM has died but really is just changing
Interesting.
Another point of interest is, every popular song has a drop now, and that's what EDM created.
You're right. Drops are pretty important to generating excitment.
Yeah, but the drops tend to me more mellow now, like break down sections.
It's interesting how music evolves.
We're just here for the ride my friend.
Where do you think the EDM's going?
We'll have to wait and see!
