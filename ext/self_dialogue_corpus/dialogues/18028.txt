Do you listen to Swing music?
I don't really. Do you have any suggestions?
Oh, I do! I have loved it since I was a kid.  Try Benny Goodman, Glenn Miller, or even Big Bad Voodoo Daddy
Big Bad Voodoo Daddy? That sounds fun
They are! They have a cover for the Jungle Book song "Wanna Be Like You"
Great, I'll have to check them out.
Check out Cherry Poppin Daddies. They had hits in the 90's when Swing got popular again
Any song suggestions?
Zoot Suit Riot, but the whole album by the same name is great.
Great! Any other bands I should check?
If you like the revival stuff, Brian Setzer Orchestra
Oh! I've heard of them! What was that one song?
Jump Jive n' Wail? I think it was in a Gap commercial then
Yes, that's it. I liked that one. What about Benny Goodman you mentioned earlier?
Benny Goodman was an original, but so great. I think his most popular song was "Sing, Sing, Sing"
Hm, I don't think I know it.
You would if you heard it, there are no lyrics, but it's a definite feel-good song.  It has to be one of my all-time favorite songs.
Oh wow, that's great. I'll have to check it out. I can't believe there's a whole genre of music I've never really explored.
I feel like swing is one of the most overlooked genres! It's so great to listen to and transcends the times.
Thanks so much! I will totally check everything out.
