What are your opinions on The Weeknd?
I actually love him! I think he makes great music and he's underrated in my opinion.
I feel the same way. I think a lot of people have false beliefs about him.
Me too, but he's a great person and his music is really good too.
What's your favorite song?
I have many but I love starboy and the hills.
The hills is one of my absolute favorite songs.
It's so good I listen to it on repeat whenever I can.
I personally love his older music more than his new music but I listen to both.
Which older songs do you like?
For example, I love the trilogy album.
I like that one too but I think his newer music is better.
he's actually on tour right now and I really want to go and check him out.
we should totally go together!
That would be so much fun. We could sing along to all of our favorite songs together.
I'm gonna check tickets and availability and see if we can go soon.
I'm so excited now, he's the best.
his music is like no other, he adds a lot to the music industry.
I think so too I can't wait to see him live.
Me too I'm super excited and ill let you know.
