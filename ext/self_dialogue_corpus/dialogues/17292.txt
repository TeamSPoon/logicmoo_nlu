What is on your playlist right now?
Mostly house music, it helps keep me energized.
Like techo type stuff?
Yes, I like spinning records channel on youtube.
Huh, I'm not a huge fan of that type but hey if it keeps you going why not ?
Yeah it's not for everyone, what are you listening to?
Mostly older rock from when I was a teen.
Like what bands?
Metallica, Guns N Roses, that category.
Well I bet that can keep you energized just like my house music does!
For sure! It gets me moving.
I like to have new stuff leafed in my playlist so I am hearing favorites and new together.
Not for me, I know what I like and I have no idea how that list keeps growing, I don't like straying from my comfort zone.
Ha, could you imagine us on a road trip together?
We'd drive the XM stereo nuts.
I bet if we went over everything we like, we could find some common ground.
I like some country.
Or maybe not. Ha. Ha.
Ha, maybe we could listen to stuff neither of us has tried out and we'd both like or hate it.
That would be a fun thing to do.
