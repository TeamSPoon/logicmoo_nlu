My kids are making me watch Moana over and over!!
I know, mine too!
Mine love it more than Frozen!
Mine too!  Especially that song "You're welcome".  They now sing it to each other instead of saying it!
That's so cute!
It would be, if I wasn't sick of the song!  There could be worse things though.  I really do like Moana.
Me too! I love it when she finally returns the heart.
That's my favorite scene!
Mine too!! And when she turns back into Te Fiti she is so beautiful!
Yes she is. The colors are so vibrant in that movie!
