Did you see the photos of everyone's outfits from the Met Gala?
Yes! Rihanna definitely stole the show there.
I agree. Did you see the exchange she had with Zendaya?
No, what happened?
She posted a photo of Zendaya's beautiful dress and called her a goddess.
Aw, that's so sweet. What other dresses did you like?
So many of them. I didn't like any of the Kardashian's though.
I agree. I wasn't a huge fan.
I think it's interesting to see the lengths to which female celebrities dress up, and  the men just wear standard suits.
Yeah. But that's society for you.
Do you remember Taylor swift's look from the last met gala?
The metallic dress with the lace up shows, platinum blonde hair and lipstick?
Yeah, that one. I can't decide if I liked it or hated it.
She coordinated well with Zayn, even though they weren't there together.
Yeah. With his bionic arm. I think the Hadid sisters had diamonds in their manicure.
Of course they did.
I am really a fan of long, flowy dresses that are simple and timeless.
I think anything can look good as long as the person is happy in it.
Selena and The Weeknd looked interesting.
Her outfit made her look very young,
