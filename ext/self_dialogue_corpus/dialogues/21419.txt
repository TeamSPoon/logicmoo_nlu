Hey do you know what my favorite movie is?
Oh, is is that one with the guy who flies the F-16 around?
Yes, Iron Eagle!
What ever happened to that guy, what was his name? Jason Gedrick?
He went on to do a bunch of TV shows like Dexter and Bosch.
Oh really? I thought he died.
No, I'm pretty sure he's alive.
So back to Iron Eagle, who was the black guy in it? Morgan Freeman?
No, that was Louis Gossett Junior.
Are you sure? I thought it was Morgan Freeman.
No, Louis Gossett Junior is the guy with the shaved head.
Oh, is he still alive?
Yeah as far as I know.
So was anyone else famous in Iron Eagle?
No, I'm pretty sure no one else in the cast really went on to be a big star.
Didnt they make a bunch of sequels?
Yeah, it got a little out of hand, they made like 3 more after that.
That's more than a little out of hand, that is just unnecessary.
The last one was the worst, it even had the guy who married Tori Spelling in it.
Dean McDermott? Wow, it must have been a disaster.
