Did any of Yngwie Malmsteen's singers come back after they were fired?
Yes!  The first time I saw Yngwie live was back in 1999, and Mark Boals was back in the fold!
Where was that show?
It was at the I-Rock Nightclub in Detroit.
I've heard of that place.  How was the show though?
Mark Boals was in very fine form!  His voice was amazing and he sang amazingly.
What about Yngwie?  I heard he goes through bad periods sometimes with his live playing.
He was off in some ways, he seemed to pick the notes randomly.  I've seen him play really good and melodiously also though.
When was that?
At the Royal Oak Music Theater one time.  He was playing with three fingers instead of four.
I've heard about that, what's up with that?
I think he overuses his pinky by using it to play the forth and fifth notes.  That involves stretching the pinky and using it twice as much as the other fingers.
Hmm.  The smallest finger and you're using it twice as much, sounds unhealthy.
Yes, that's what I think it is.  Just jog your hand a little and use your index finger and your pinky instead of overusing your pinky!
So, any other good songs you've listened to lately?
Yes, I was listening to Leonardo the other day.  It's from an album that came out in 2000 and it features Mark Boals on vocals.
Wow, so that's a good one?
Yes, I like it a lot; it's about Leonardo Da Vinci.
Amazing!  I think I'll listen to that on Youtube when I get home.
Great idea, that's where I was listening to it!
