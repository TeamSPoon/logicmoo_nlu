Have you seen the Slumber Party Massacre Series?
I think so. Did they used to be on VHS?
Oh yeah. They're old school 80's horror movies.
Slasher sub genre, right?
Yup! One of the best!
And part 2?
Part is one of the silliest movies you will ever see.
What's silly about it?
The Driller Killer comes back from the dead in dreams!
Like Freddy Krueger from A Nightmare On Elm Street?
Exactly! He's taunting Courtney from part 1 in her dreams!
That sounds different from what I thought the movie was going to be.
The Driller Killer has a whole song and dance number.
I thought this was a horror movie?!
I guess it's a horror comedy. So was Slumber Party Massacre part 1 I guess.
Less funny from what I can recall.
The movies are super indie and low budget, but very charming and fun.
Isn't there a part 3?
Yes. Part 3 is there was well. It's not as good, but still  quite fun!
I'm excited. I'm going to order them.
