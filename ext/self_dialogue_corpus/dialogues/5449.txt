What do you think about Alice in Wonderland?
The cartoon or live action?
Both?
The cartoon was great. Confusing but true to Lewis Carroll.  The live action had awesome costumes.
Ha ha. I did expect mroe out of Johnny Depp at the Mad Hatter.
Did you see the sequel with Sasha Baron Cohen?
No, I just couldn't stand to be bored that long.
I thought it was better than the first one. But the cartoon is better.
Yeah, it lends itself to a cartoon.
Especially the Cheshire Cat.
