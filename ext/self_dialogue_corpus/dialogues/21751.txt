What you seen the new Mummy Movie
The one with Tom Cruise
Yeah, I loved the Brandon Fraiser version but I am not use about this one
I have not seen it but the reviews are not good
Yeah, rotten tomatoes does not recommend
I may wait for it on DVD
I do like seeing big movies in the theater though
But is it worth $10 to spend on a ticket
I kinda just want to watch the 1999 verision again
That is a great idea, it is so funny
It made me like Brandon Fraiser
I just want to let him stay in that movie and not see anything new
That is good because he is not in anything new
That is not a problem because he is no movie
True but he was in everything for a while
Yes, I also like Blast from the Past
That was a sweet movie
It also gave me a Alicia Silverstone fix
Lets do a movie night
It's on
