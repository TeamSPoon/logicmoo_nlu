Did you hear lady gaga's song on the radio today?
Yes, but they didn't play the whole song.
What song was it?
It was bad romance.
Oh, I don't like that song.
Well which song do you like?
I like born this way?
Why do you like that song?
I like it because she tells about her life.
That's good, I'm sure others can relate to it too.
