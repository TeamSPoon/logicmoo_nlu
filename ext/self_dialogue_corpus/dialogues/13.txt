I just saw Dr. Strange and I loved it.
Me too. It was all psychedelic and Benedict Cumerbatch was awesome.
Yeah, he was born to play Stephen Strange. Yeah, he started off all stuffy and arrogant but I knew he had a good guy in there somewhere.
Remember the car accident?
It was scary, even though I knew it was fake I still got scared.
It was sad when he yelled at Christine, she was just trying to help.
He was broken, he couldn't use his hands after the accident.
It was so cool when he became Dr. Strange.
Remember the Cloak of levitation?
It was so great when the cloak chose him to be it's master. I think the cloak loved Dr. Strange.
