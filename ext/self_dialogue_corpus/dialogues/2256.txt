I'm so excited for NFL football to get here!
Me too, it seems like it's been gone forever.
There's a lot of good storylines in the NFL this year, what are you watching?
So much, as always, the Patriots will probably win it all.
They're the worst!
Yeah, but no matter what, they have to be the favorites.
Marshawn Lynch with the Raiders is also an interesting one to watch.
Yeah, that's a match made in heaven: crazy and crazy.
It's always fun to see the rookies that surprise you.
My dark horse for rookie of the year is Derek Barnett.
Garrett got all the press, but Barnett was more productive against top competition.
Plus, the Browns are a mess, while the Eagles have some players.
I'm also excited to watch Trubisky crash and burn.
He was overdrafted for sure.
Who's your preseason MVP pick?
Hard not to pick Brady, but wouldn't shock me if it was Matt Ryan.
Yeah, last year could be the stepping stone on the way to greatness for the Falcons or the high point.
Time will tell.
I'm picking the Cowboys to win it all this year.
Bold pick, we'll see if they have enough experience.
