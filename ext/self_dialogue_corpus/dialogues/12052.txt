I heard an interesting thing about the Star Wars movies?
Oh yeah? What's that?
Well, Star Wars really is just one big family messing up the universe?
Why's that?
Well, there's the Skywalker's. And then there's Darth Vader who's the father.
Right! And then Anakin, Darth Maul, even Kylo Ren.
Exactly all the heroes and villains are just one big family.
Yeah, that makes sense.
And without this family, including the heroes, the universe would be much more peaceful.
Skywalker Star Wars.
