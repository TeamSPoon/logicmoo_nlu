So did you hear about Taylor Swift?
What, is she releasing a new album?
No, but it's almost as exciting as that!
Don't keep me in the dark, what happened?
Well, she has officially put her music back on spotify!
No kidding? I thought she had some kind of beef with the music companies.
Yeah, she'd said before that it was ripping off artists and you didn't make enough money from it.
Huh, why'd she change her mind?
I don't know, I haven't heard.
Well, I'll take the music anyway. Is she on Google Play too?
I think she was always with them, something to do with YouTube.
Ah, good to know. I'll look forward to listening to some of her old songs!
Me too, especially since I never owned a couple of them and so there will be songs I've never heard.
So it kinda is like her releasing a new album, at least in your case.
Yep! I can't wait to get some classic Tay back in my life.
You prefer her older music best?
I mean don't get me wrong, 1989 is great. But something about Tim McGraw will always be special.
It's probably just 'cause you grew up with it.
Haha, I guess, but I love that country twang.
I'll pull it up now for you, in that case!
