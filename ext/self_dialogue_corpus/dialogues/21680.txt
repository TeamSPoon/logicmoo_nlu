Are you a fan of the Rocky movies?
Yes, definitely. Loved almost all of them.
Which one is your favorite?
I like the first one, but I also like Rocky IV.
Is that the one with Drago?
Yes, all about the cold war as well
Yes, didn't Apollo Creed die in that one?
Yes, Drago killed him.
And then that's what inspired Rocky to fight him
Yes, said he would go to Russia to train and fight
Right, there's the whole scene where he's chopping wood and climbing mountains
Yes, and Drago only trained inside a gym
And took a lot of steroids
Well a lot of good that did him
Yes, Rocky proved that natural training is the way to go
Right, but I don't think Stallone was really natural with those muscles
True, he was incredibly ripped in that movie
I loved his shorts in that one as well
The American flag shorts?
Yes, those were great.
