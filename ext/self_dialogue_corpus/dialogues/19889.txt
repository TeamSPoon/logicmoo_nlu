Who is that?
Oh, he's an awesome musician.
What type of music does he play?
Well, it's kind of a piano based poppish type of deal.
Ugh, that doesn't sound like my thing.
Oh, but it's not like classical piano or anything like that.

He used to, but he does a lot of solo stuff.

The name of that one was "Brick."
