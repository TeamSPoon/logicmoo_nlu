What thriller did you feel could have been better?
No Country for Old Men.
Really, I think that won an oscar.
I just thought the book was so much better.
I did not know there was a book first.
Yes the novel was by Cormac McCarthy.
I don't think I like him much. theone book I read was so boring.
Well he is a hard read at times. But no country for old men was an amazing book.
Well Hollywood doesn't turn just any book into a movie.
True, I did like Josh Brolin's performance . I just prefer the book strongly overall.
