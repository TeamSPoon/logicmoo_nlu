So who is your favorite all-time musician?
Gosh, that's such a hard one to answer!  I would have to say Garth Brooks.
Wow, really? I didn't know you like country music so much.
Well it's not so much that, but he's an amazing artist with such a great voice.
Yeah, I do know what you mean.  He plays music well and sings well and writes beautiful songs.
Yes, and such a variety, too.  Some are fast, some are slow.
Which one is your favorite?
Definitely Friends in Low Places!  I never get sick of hearing that song.
Yeah, that's a great song.  They were talking about him on the radio the other morning and how amazing he is live in concert.
Oh I bet it is unbelievable.  I'd go see him live if he came anywhere near here.
Me too.  There aren't any singers like Garth around anymore.
No, there aren't.  So who's your favorite?
I don't know, it's a really tough call, too.  I guess I would say Dr. Dre.
Really?  I never would've guessed that.
He has such amazing beats.  They were unique and different.
Yeah, he did kinda re-write hip hop at the time.  I think he had a really positive impact on the genre in general.
Yeah, I think so too.  Everything he ever produced came out unique and with a great sound.
I don't know about everything, but most things.
Yeah, true.  He worked with a lot of different people, too.
Yeah, Biggie, Eminem, Tupac, the list goes on.
