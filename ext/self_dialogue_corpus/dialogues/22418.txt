You've got to have at least a top five list of all-time favorite movies, let me hear them.
I guess Caddyshack, Super Troopers, Anchorman, Step Brothers, and The Hangover. Yours?
Oh shoot I have so many! The Hangover and Anchorman I can agree with but you forgot Superbad, 21 Jump Street and Shaun of the Dead!
Oh man, 21 Jump Street was hilarious, "Use your words, use your words!" But 22 Jump Street or whatever it's called was horrible.
Have you seen Horrible Bosses with Jason Bateman, Charlie Day and Jason Sudeikis? Funniest matchup but what did you think of the sequel?
Of course, not as good but it had its moments. I forgot about This is The End! That was a nice surprise but Hot Tub Time Machine was better.
Best part of that one was Craig Robinson but the 2nd really stunk. You know what other sequel was a dud?
There are too many but I'm going to go with Anchorman 2 - what a waste of time! Oh what about Dumb and Dumber Too?
Anchorman 2 was painful to watch and Dumb and Dumber Too was a fat waste of awesome talent.
I'm really surprised that Will Ferrell and Company allowed that one out there. What were they thinking?
I don't know but I do know how fast they like to get these crappy movies out there.
True Story! Hey, what's one of your favorite quotes from Wedding Crashers?
Ha! That's tough too, let's see...oh yeah when that lady said, "You shut your mouth when you're talking to me!" I use that all the time!
What about Caddyshack? "Don't sell yourself short Judge, you're a tremendous slouch." Classic!
Yeah Ty is completely underrated! So sad that Harold Ramis is actually gone.
And Ted Knight! I think his innotation was spot on!
So was Carl's, "Cinderella story, outta nowhere!" Bill Murray is still pretty good with a kind of dry humor.
He was in Stripes wasn't he?
Oh yeah - who else was in that who died young?
John Candy! Yeah, rest in peace big fella.
