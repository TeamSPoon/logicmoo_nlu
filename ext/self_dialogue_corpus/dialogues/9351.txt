What do you think about the new Rappers that have come out lately.
I really dont consider them rappers most of them I dont like.
You cant even name one that you like? Thats pretty bad
Kendrick Lamar Is probably one of the best new artists that i can respect and actually call him a rapper.
What about Drake
Drake is not a rapper in my eyes. From what i hear he dont even write his own stuff.
So it matters to you if a rapper writes his own lyrics. People that sing dont be writing the songs but they are still cinsiderd a singer
True but rap is diffrent your telling about your life your struggles and that dont match up if someone else is writing it
I guess What about future
All that man talks about is getting high I like rappers that take your on a journey with there words that fool act taking nobody nowhere
