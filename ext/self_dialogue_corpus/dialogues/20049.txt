Which summer movie will make the most money this year?
I think Guardians of the Galaxy 2 will do the best.
Really? I'm not so sure about that.
Which one do you think will then?
I think the new Spider-Man movie will be a huge hit.
Yeah, that one will do well. But don't you think people are tired of all these Spider-Man movies?
That's a fair point. But this is going to be a proper Marvel film.
Well, it will also have Robert Downey Jr. in it.
Yeah, that will definitely give it a boost.
Which summer movie are you looking forward to the most?
I really want to see Dunkirk.
Yeah, that one looks good.
I love war movies in general, but this one is also a Chris Nolan movie.
Yeah, I'm excited for that one as well.
Which film is your most anticipated?
I'm looking forward to Valerian.
I think that film might be a major flop.
I have those same worries, but I'm holding out hope that it will be great.
It's going to be a fun summer. There are lots of big movies coming out this year.
I can't wait.
