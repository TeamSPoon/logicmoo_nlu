Did you see that Rams Vs. 49ers game?
I watched some of it but turned it off at halftime.
I couldn't believe the Rams got shut out like that.
Oh yea, what was the final score?
The Rams lost 28 to 0.
Are you telling me that the Rams couldn't even get a field goal?
Yes, I was shocked by their performance.
I'm glad I didn't watch the second half.
Yes, you didn't miss too much.
How many passing yards did Keenum get?
A lowly 120 yards.
Really? What was his QB rating?
You are not going to believe this but 5.1.
How is that even possible?
Everyone he threw the ball to dropped passes.
Unbelievable, how did Gabbert do for the 49ers?
He had 170 passing yards and a QB rating of 91.
Well, that explains why his team won.
Yep, I think I am not going to watch the Rams next week.
I agree. I may go to sleep early again.
