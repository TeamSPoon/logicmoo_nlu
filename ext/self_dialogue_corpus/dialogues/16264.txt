Do you follow current music much?
Yes and no. I hear the big hits on the radio, but I wouldn't say I am an avid follower.
Is there any specific genre you like?
Not really. I enjoy most music and I'm sure I can find at least one song in any genre that I would listen to.
I really like one-hit wonders.
What?! That's not exactly a genre.
I know. But I find it fascinating that a group or artist can have one amazing song that everyone knows, and essentially never be heard from again.
That is kind of weird isn't it? Do you have a favorite?
Not in particular, but I like a lot of the 80s ones.
Oh, like Tainted Love, Come On Eileen, and I'm too Sexy?
Yes, but believe it or not, I'm too Sexy was from the 90s.
It has such an 80s vibe though!
Well, it was in 1991.
Oh, that makes sense. I feel like the style of the decade always carries over a few years.
Do you have any one-hit wonders that you like?
I have a lot that I like, but who can say no to Macarena!
Oh yes, the Macarena. The dance craze that never dies!
Also, for some reason I really love the song My Sharona.
Who sang that one again?
I think it was The Knack.
