Do you like Michael Jackson?
Adult, or kid?
Both
I think he has always been a great singer
Which music do you like better?
Between the kid stuff and adult?
Yes
I prefer the kid stuff
The Jackson 5 were great
I agree
But, I do like his adult stuff too
You have to. There are so many classics
And he is a great dancer
No arguments there
I wish I could have seen him live
Me too
He was probably even better than we are saying
Is he called the King of Pop?
Yes
That suits him
