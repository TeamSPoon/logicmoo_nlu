The best Star Wars movie was the first one.
Oh, yes, Harrison Ford was so young and handsome.
Who played Luke Skywalker in the first Star Wars movie?
I can't remember, but he had an awful haircut in that movie.
My least favorite characterization was Jabba the Hutt--was it the second Star Wars>
I think so. I agree, how stupid for a big slug to laschiviously look at Carrie Fisher.
I did enjoy Darth Vader.
Oh, my, that deep, sexy voice of James Earl Ray.
It was kind of stupid for Luke and Leia's mom to die of heartbreak.
Seriously, I mean, she "lost" Anakin, but she had 2 beautiful babies!
