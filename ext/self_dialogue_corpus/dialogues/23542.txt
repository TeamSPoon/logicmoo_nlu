Did you see the new Marvel film?
Which one?
Wonder Woman!
It's not out yet!
Yes it is!
Wow, let's go!
When do you want to go to the movies?
I'm free this weekend.
Great! Let's go to a double header.
Okay, what's the other movie you want to see?
It should also be a Marvel film.
Sounds good. How about Hulk?
Yeah, let's do an Avengers!
Ok. You want to see the first one or the second movie in that series?
Both!
Great! That will be a triple header then!
Wow, I love movies about superheroes!
Me too! Is Batman really a superhero though?
Definitely!
Okay. We'll have to do DC movies next weekend!
