Coldplay's new song is pretty tight.
They have a new song?
Yep, it's called All I Think About is You.
Well, Coldplay's songs haven't been that great lately.
This one's a bit different as it harkens back to another era.
You mean their older stuff?
Right, reminds you more of Parachutes.
So this isn't electronic at all?
Nope, has a dirty beat to it kind of.
Sounds promising.
I really like how midway through the song, it catches a tempo.
Kind of like Politik?
Kind of, it takes urgency on as it rises.
That's cool.  I thought they were done with new songs though.
They did say on their last album that that was their last.
Then how do they have a new song?
I think they'll always make music honestly.
Yeah, that or just release some EP's.
They'll have a new album I'm sure.  They can't stay away.
I hope they don't, I love their stuff!
