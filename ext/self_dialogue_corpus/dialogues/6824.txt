Do you want to watch the Little Mermaid?
I love that movie! Ariel is the epitome of the Disney princesses.
She was born royal and married royalty.
It always bothered me a little that she gave up who she was for a man she barely knew.
It's the ultimate gesture, though, the willingness to change for love.
She gets to keep her relationship with her family, I guess. She seemed to really want to be human, in any event.
Ever notice how her hair never seems wet?
That's a mermaid trick.mermaid hair always looks flawless.
Ursula was always a scary character when I was young. She is so evil.
If you think about it, though, she is scorned. She lost her power to Tritan, she is just trying to get even.
