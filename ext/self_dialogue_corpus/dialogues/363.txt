Did you see Batman Vs. Superman?
No, but I heard it was awful.
Oh my god, it was.  I can't believe they released a movie like that.
What was so bad about it?
Well, for one, the plot was a mess.  It made no sense, was impossible to follow, and had just ridiculous moments.
Well, it was a superhero movie, so shouldn't it be a little ridiculous?
Yes, but in a good way.  This was just silly.  Also, Ben Affleck is a terrible batman.  And the batsuit looked like a suit of armor - there's no way someone could jump from buildings in that.
Oh wow, that does sound awful.  Should I see it just to laugh at it?
No, I wouldn't suggest it.  It's frustrating more than anything.  After Chris Nolan's Dark Knight series, this is just a letdown.
Ah well, hopefully they'll get it right next time.
