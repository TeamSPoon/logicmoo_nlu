I took the kids to see Cars 3 the other day?
How was it? Did you like it?
I really did like it. It was closer to the first one in terms of plot.
The second one with the spying was really bad.
Yes it was so I think they realized that and let the franchise get back to it's roots.
They probably didn't want the franchise to end with a lousy movie.
Most likely the reason. The animation was fantastic.
What was it about.
Ok. Spoiler alert. Here goes.
No problem. I probably won't see it anyway.
Well Lightening McQueen is getting older as her his other racing friends.
Well sure because it has been like over a decade since the last one came out.
Yes and cars don't last forever. Ha ha!
Ok, go one.
Well all of a sudden some new cars are brought out. They look different than the other races, more like Formula 1 type cars.
So these cars overtake the older ones?
Yes, now they begin to win races and McQueen starts to lose confidence because he cannot be fast enough.
So speed he is not. Ha ha!
Right, so anyway he tries not to give up and goes into the next race and really tries to win but...
doesn't? Is that where in the trailer it shows he crashes?
