If you had to pick one WR in the NFL, who would you pick?
Probably Julio Jones... what do you think?
That is a good answer. I sometimes think Odell Beckham Jr is, but he is kinda crazy and inconsistent.
Agreed, but, wow he may have the greatest catch in NFL history.
Oh for sure, but for top catches you gotta talk about Antonio Freeman back in 2001 in that Monday Night Football game vs the Vikings
Oh yeah, and Al Michaels had that iconic Call....
...He did what?!?!
Yup. That's it haha. Oh man, Antonio Freeman. I really like those nostalgic mediocre players that people kinda forget about these days.
Like James Thrash.
Hahah. Exactly. Or like Muhshin Mohhammed.
Oh yeah, from the Panthers and Bears. He was a great possession WR!
Yeah, he was a guy that would have 100 catches and barely 1000 yards!
He reminds me of another Bears possession WR, Marty Booker.
Oh yeah, he was on probably one of the worst 13-3 teams I can ever remember. Jim Miller was the QB!
Yeah, it was kinda silly. The Packers swept the Bears that year and went 12-4 themselves, but didn't even win the division.
Yeah the Packers had a great team that year. I think that year they ended up losing in the playoffs to the Kurt Warner led St. Louis Rams.
Ugh. That game depresses me. I think Favre threw 7 interceptions that game.
Oh what a surprise. Favre throwing interceptions in the playoffs. How typical.
Yup. Live by the Favre, die by the Favre.
At least he threw a horrible game-losing pick for the Vikings in 2009 too.
