Hey, do you have any plans for this weekend?
No not at the moment. What do you have in mind?
I was thinking of going to the movies. Do you know of anything that is out at the moment?
Right now I know that The Mummy, Cars 3, and Wonder Woman are out.
Hmm all of those sounds OK. Would you be interested in seeing The Mummy with me?
I have actually read bad reviews about that one.
Really? What did they say?
Mainly that Tom Cruise did a bad job and that they do not compare well to the older releases.
That sounds about right, I think I'll pass on that one then.
Would you be open to seeing Wonder Woman?
Sure! That sounds like it would be a good movie.
It is. I have friends who have told me it is very good. Are you familiar with the story?
Not really. Should I watch some of the older Marvel movies?
Yes, that would be a smart idea. It would help you understand what's going on.
Which movies should I watch to catch up with the storyline?
You should check out the Avenger movies and the prequels.
Which are the prequels?
Captain America and it's sequels and the Iron Man series is a must watch to know the back story.
Awesome! Thanks for the help. I will check those out before we go.
No problem. Thanks for inviting me to go with you.
