Hi bro
Whats good man
Nothing much
Same so i got some questions about star wars stuff
Yeah what is up
Well i want to know what you think do you think Anakin is proud of his grandson?
Nah i think that he is let down by his actions for repeating them and following his footsteps
I kinda feel the same but wonder if he is really dead
Their is some possibility he is alive you never know
True enough it can be possible
