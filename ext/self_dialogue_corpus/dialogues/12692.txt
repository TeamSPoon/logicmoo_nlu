Have you seen Rouge One?
Yes. i thought it was pretty good.
Yeah I'm kinda excited about every other year seeing a Star Wars story. Kinda an off shoot.
Yeah It was cool to see how the actually got the blue prints for the death star.
Yeah it was. How did you feel about the force awakens?
It was good but there was too much "Star Wars" to keep the e trend fans of the original movies happy.
Yeah but I still liked it. It had some good really funny parts to break it up.
I'm excited to see how powerful Luke skywalker is. Since he is the last Jedi.
I knew Hans solo was going to die. Harrison ford was getting too old.
Yeah. I was still sad.
