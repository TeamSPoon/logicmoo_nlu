Have you ever seen The Jungle Book?
No. What is it?
It's a Disney movie about a boy that's raised by animals in the jungle.
You mean like that other movie about the guy raised by apes?
Kind of. Except This one a boy is raised by wolves.
What's the difference?
Well, the boys name is Mowgli. He's raised by wolves, but he has to leave home when a Tiger comes after him. The movie is about his adventure away from home.
Why does the Tiger come after him?
I don't want to give too much away. You should watch the movie.
I'll check it out when I have time.
