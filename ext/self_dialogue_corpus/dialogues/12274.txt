When did you first see star wars?
I first remember watching bits and pieces of the Return of the Jedi when I was about six years old at a friends house.  How about you?
My dad would watch the original three movies with me when I was a kid.  I had to much of it memorized.
The scene I remember the clearest is when Luke gets away from the sand worm.
I always thought that part was pretty cool!
What scenes stood out to you the most when you first saw the movies?
I hated watching Leia as Jaba's slave.  That part disturbed me.
I didn't like when Luke took Darth Vader's mask off right before he died.
But I really liked the swamp planet where Luke first met Yoda.  I thought Yoda was awesome.
Luke impressed me when he used the force to get his plane out of the water.
