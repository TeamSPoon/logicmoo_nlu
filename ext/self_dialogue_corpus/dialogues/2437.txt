What are your thoughts on the new rule changes
I think they're dumb but who knows how everything will play out
I feel like Roger Goodell is just changing stuff because he wants to, and he's not actually changing anything of substance
Yeah the overtime rule change was pointless
Who is your favorite team?
Cleveland
Ouch, Im sorry to hear that
Hah, Its ok Im a loyal fan
How do you feel about the season?
Im happy about the draft, Im somewhat optimistic, but we have a tough division.
Yeah I hear you, I have the Steelers winning that division pretty easily
I can see why
I feel like whoever wins is just being setup to lose to New England
Its so crazy how they always just seem to get better
Yeah Bill does a great job moving on at the right time
I dont understand how they get so many good players for so cheap
Winning environment, people will take a discount to win titles
Yeah I guess so
You think they'll win again?
Yeah probably
