Do you watch NFL games a lot?
Sort of, whenever I have the time, really.
Well aren't they always on Sunday?
Yeah, but there's usually several games at once.
True, I just pick the one I am most interested in to watch.
Yeah, sometimes I do try and watch multiple games at the same time though.
How do you manage that?
I just flip the channels back and forth or look on the internet.
Seems like a lot of work.
It is, but I just love so many teams.
Which teams do you like?
I like the Steelers, I like the Packers....
The Packers? Oh boy....
Hey, they aren't that bad.
Not bad, just not my cup of tea.
I also like the Patriots.
Oh god, another one that's not my cup of tea.
And what's wrong with them?
I just think they are wayyyy overhyped.
I don't think so, but agree to disagree!
