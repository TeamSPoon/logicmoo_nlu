Do you like any movies that are going to come out this summer?
Not really at the moment.
How about Baywatch?
I think that movie is going to bomb.
I dont know what the expectations are.
Well The Rock is in it.
So what does that mean?
He usually doesnt do dud movies
Well no one knows a bomb until the box office hits them
He knows how to read a script
Will any of the originals be in it?
I dont think they are.
Zac Efron is
He has become a meat piece for movies.
Like he cant act?
He can but its his body they want.
That sounds absurd.
Its like reverse sexism in LA.
Well he does have a great body.
But needs to improve his acting.
