Do you think they will ever kill Luke off?
Well Mark Hamill cant work forever
Yeah and I mean his character will get old.
Thats a stranger way to go.
I think that they will have him get killed soon
He is in a self imposed exile.
I dont think thats how he will
So will he be fighting
Yeah I think theyll have him come back in that kind of role
Thats an interesting take
