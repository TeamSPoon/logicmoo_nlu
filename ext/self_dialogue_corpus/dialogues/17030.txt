What do you think about music in movies?
What do you mean?
Like the background music that plays.
I think it can get a little cheesy at times.
Oh yeah totally.
But, it's definitely necessary to make the movie more interesting.
I agree. Like if a movie was just talking, then it would be kind of boring.
What movies best utilize music you think?
Probably action movies.
Ah yeah. The action scenes need to have music to be more epic.
Can you imagine a fight scene without and music?
Yeah it would be punches and grunts.
Action music can be pretty enjoyable in my opinion.
How so?
Well it's intense, dramatic, and actually sounds pretty cool.
I wouldn't listen to it in my free time though
Why not?
It's kind of noisy, and like I said, a little cheesy.
To each his own.
I guess so.
