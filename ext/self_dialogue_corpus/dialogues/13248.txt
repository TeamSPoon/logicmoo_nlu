Who is your favorite Star Wars character?
Yoda, I love him.
Why do you like Yoda so much?
There are so many reasons, the way he looks and the way he talks are two of them.
I have never really liked Yoda.
Who do you like?
Chewbacca has to be my favorite.
I like Chewbacca, he is funny. I thought you would go with the standard Luke or Vader.
I tend to surprise people sometimes.
Just like George Lucas, you both have quite a creative mind.
