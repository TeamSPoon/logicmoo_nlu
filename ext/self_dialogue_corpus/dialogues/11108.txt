Did you see Miley Cyrus' dress at the MTV awards?
Oh my gosh, yes I did. It was crazy! But nothing like Lady Gaga.
You are so right about that! She wore a meat dress!
Right?! I could hardly believe it when I saw her.
Just waiting for Kate Hudson to jump out with her new "Fabletics" line.
That would have been amazing! I love her leggings.
They just look so comfortable.
I would wear those with just about anything.
Have you seen Kelly Osbourne?
Yes, I love her sense of fashion. She gets me!
She seems to know a lot about fashion, and what is all the trends.
Her dad doesn't have a lot of fashion sense though.
Speaking of dads, have you seen Suri Cruise? Well not about her dad.
I know, She is gorgeous. She could be a fashion model.
Her dad is quite stylish, albeit a bit strange. I do like a sharp dressed man.
You know who is a sharp dressed man, LL Cool J.
I love those shirts he wears. They really show off his muscles.
Yes, they do. He could be a model.
Isn't he a fashion model?
I really don't know. I wonder.
