I like NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET.
It was created by Wes Craven.
Freddie looks scary.
He has an ugly face.
And his fingers are metal.
The first movie is from 1984.
It is a horror movie.
There were 9 movies total.
They were slasher films.
There was a TV series.
And there were novels.
And there was a comic book.
A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET was the first movie.
Freddy Krueger stalks teens.
But only in their dreams.
But the teens were buried alive.
The movies are from an independent film company.
Yes, from NEW LINE CINEMA.
The films got mixed reviews.
But it was a success overall.
