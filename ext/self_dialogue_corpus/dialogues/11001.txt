How in the world did the Penguins lose to the Senators?
They just weren't ready to play.
They looked lackadaisical and sluggish out there.
Yeah, I was really disappointed in their energy level.
I tell you what, if they don't bring some intensity for game 2. This serious could be over quick.
I agree with you! They won't come back if they lose game 2
I really think this could be their year, if they can refocus
Yeah I do too, but if they drop that 2nd game then all bets are off.
They really need some leadership from Sidney Crosby.
I agree. He is their best player and he needs to step up
And they are playing at home, so they can't afford to lose this one.
They need to come out way more aggresively to even this series up.
Yeah,  you can't lose 2 games at home and expect to win this series
This team needs to get more shots on goal in order to be effective
I couldn't agree more. That aggressivenss needs to be established at the beginning of the game
Right. If they don't the Senators will really take it to them.
No doubt about it. The Senators are playing great as a team right now.
Exactly! The Penguins better get their heads out of their butts in order to turn this thing around.
If not, they will be watching the games on their sofas like we are.
You are so right! I couldn't have said it better myself!
