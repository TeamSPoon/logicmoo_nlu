Boston's doing awful this year.
They're abysmal with fielding.
They're great at hitting and nothing else.
They're going to get creamed.
They're already getting creamed.
Yeah, but harder.
They're going to get wrecked hard by a semi decent team.
They shouldn't be losing
They'll keep losing regardless.
They love to lose.
I wish I could have pride in them.
We all do.
I wish I could be a prideful Bostonian.
They're like the least terrible thing about Boston.
Cruel.
Real.
Boston is pretty okay.
Boston is a horror and the team reflects that.
They're boring but they're not bad.
They abysmal.
