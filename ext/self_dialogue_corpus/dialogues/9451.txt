Did you hear that Snoop Dogg changed his name?
Yeah, to Snoop Lion right?
No, he changed it back.
What do you mean?
He was going by Snoop Lion, but then he changed it back to Snoop Dogg.
What's the point of that?
I don't know, I guess it's to represent a shift in his character or his music.
It sounds more like a publicity stunt to me.
It seems like a dumb thing to do for publicity.
I don't know, it worked out for P Diddy!
