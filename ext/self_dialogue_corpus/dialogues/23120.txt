Guess what I went and saw last night?
What?
The Secret Life of Pets!  It was awesome.
Oh I've been dying to see that!  How was it?
I loved it!  It totally lived up to its reviews.
I'd love to know what my pets are doing and thinking during the day when I'm gone.
I know right? It really cast light into the mind of pets.
So was it as funny as it's supposed to be?
Oh yeah, even funnier.  The two dogs are hilarious.
What actors did the voices in that movie?
Well Louis C.K. is one of them.  He's hilarious.
Oh yeah, I love him!
And Kevin Hart was another one.  So they are two of my favorite comedians.
Yeah, that definitely would make for a great movie.
It is, you should see it.  It's got a lot of good adventure too.
Really?  It didn't seem adventurous in the previews.
I know.  I was surprised by that, but the pets really go out on a limb.
What about the cats?  They seemed funny too.
There are definitely some funny cats, and a whole host of other animals.
Okay, you've got me sold!  I'm going to see it tonight.
