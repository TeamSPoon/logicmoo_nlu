Have you heard the new Black Flag album
I haven't heard it yet.
We'll save yourself the trouble.
Is it really that bad?
It's awful and can't remotely compare to their classic albums.
Sadly not surprised, given how long they were inactive
Me either, though I did see them live and that was still fun.
I bet due to their older tunes, speaking of which what's your favorite?
Wow that's a tough one, but also been partial towards Nervous Breakdown if forced to choose.
Great choice, but I like Rise Above best.
