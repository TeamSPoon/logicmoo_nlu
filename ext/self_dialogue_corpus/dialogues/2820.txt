Would you say the NFL has gotten more or less fun to watch in the last ten years?
In my opinion it's a lot more fun to watch.
What do you think that's attributable to?
I think the game is just constantly evolving.
I agree. That has a lot to do with it.
I also think that players are constantly setting the bar higher for eachother.
I agree there, too. It seems like players are way better than they were ten years ago.
Also, coaches and their staff have a better understanding of the game than ever.
Definitely. I feel like NFL football is a lot faster paced than it used to be.
I totally agree. In my opinion it makes it more entertaining.
Some of the passes that they land seem completely unreal at this point.
Yeah, throwing into 3 man coverage and landing it perfectly.
Landing it perfectly from 60 yards back, too.
That's definitely not something you would have seen some years ago.
I think the plays and formations are becoming more unique too.
That's true. In some cases, teams are running completely different styles of play.
The Patriots have very interesting and unique offensive formations.
Yeah, the Colts do also.
Do you think the changes in game rules have made a difference at all?
Not much of one. The rule changes have been very minor as far as I know.
