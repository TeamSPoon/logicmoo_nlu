I've always loved Cinderella.  It's my favorite Disney movie.
It's a classic.  I love the characterizations.
Yes, the mice are so cute.
They're such nice sidekicks for Cinderella.
I love how they try to help her get her ball gown ready.
That's such an endearing part.
The stepmother is a great villain.  So hateful!
She is formidable.  Her daughters are so foolish.
I love that dance that Cinderella has with the Prince at the ball.
It's so romantic when they sing "So This Is Love."
