You listen to Train?
I do sometimes.  Their music is pretty good.
Have you heard their new album?
I've heard some of the songs.
Do you like the new single?
Yeah, the deejay one?  I love it.
Are the other songs on the CD good?
There are like three of them that have a throwback soulful feel.  I liked those the best.
They are usually so creative.
Yeah, they are fun to listen to.
