What's a girl like you doing in a place like this?
Oh wow! That's only the worst pick-up line I've ever heard.
What's your sign?
Ok. I take back my previous statement. That's the worst.
Sorry, sorry. Seriously though, can I buy you a drink?
What can it hurt. Sure.
What are you having?
I'll have a scotch.
Great. What's your name?
Wouldn't you like to know!!
Ok then. I really wish they would change the music in here.
I know, right. It's horrible.
Country is my least favorite genre.
Mine too.
What do you like?
I like the oldies, like the Beatles and Led Zeppelin.
You don't like any new music? Have you heard of Cage the Elephant?
No I sure haven't. Are they good?
They're great! I'll see if they have any on the jukebox.
Awesome. If not, play some Zeppelin.
