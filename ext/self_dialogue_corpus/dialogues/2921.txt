Are you getting the NFL channel this year again?
Of course, I don't want to miss good games.
Are you still Seahawks fan?
Yup, always!
Russell Wilson's good, but I think my team will beat you this season!
No way! Your QB's getting old.
Ouch! That's true though, unfortunately...
And I thought Larry is retiring.
No, he'll play another season. He can still play good.
I don't know...he's getting up there, too.
Sadly, yeah. We will be needing new QB and receivers...
You guys need a whole new team!
Nah, you saw David Johnson. He's young and super talented.
What position does he play?
He's a running back.
Oh, yeah, now I remember. Yeah, he is good.
Right? Besides we still have decent defense.
Still Seahawks will beat the Cards, for sure.
As long as the Patriots doesn't win I don't care.
Ugh! I know, I'm sick of them!
