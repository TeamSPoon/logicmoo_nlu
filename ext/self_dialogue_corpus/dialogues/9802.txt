Do you think that rap music is better now than when Tupac was alive?
Absolutely not better than Tupac!
Well, I agree that he was a legend in his time, but what about artists like Common?
I think Common is good but he's got nothing on Tupac.
Well, I think that rap today has some great artists who are more expressive in their music.
Yes, they are like T.I. but they are doing more than rap and that's like diluting the rap industry with other things.
But what you call diluting is actually more of creativity. Do you think Tupac wouldn't be diversifying today if he were still alive?
It's hard to say because he was specific to his genre during his time but he did venture into acting as well.
So maybe rap today would be better if he were still around?
I think it definitely would.
