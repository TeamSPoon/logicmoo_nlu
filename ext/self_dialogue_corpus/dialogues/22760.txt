what film do you think has a great dance number?
I really liked the dance scene in Get Smart.
It was funny but I mean a truly great dance number.
Well maybe in that case lala land.
I loved all the choreography in that film.
Me too. who was it done by?
Mandy moore.
That's right, she is great. what is your favorite?
I loved the very opening number.
That is such a grand scale undertaking.
Totally. They closed down the freeway even!
I am sure that made so many commuters mad.
Ya LA traffic is already awful.
I think it was worth it.
I agree,so epic and wonderful dancing.
I thought that movie was so great all around.
Yes, great script, dancing and acting.
That one song, city of stars is so catchy.
When I hear it I  end up signing it for like 3 days.
Ya it gets stuck in your head easily.
