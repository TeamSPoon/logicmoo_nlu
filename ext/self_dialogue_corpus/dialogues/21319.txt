Have you seen any new movies lately?
I saw the new Guardians of the Galaxy.
I haven't seen it yet, is it good?
Yeah, but not as good as the first one.
What are your top Marvel movies?
I really like Civil War, that's probably my favorite.
Yeah me too, either that or the first Avengers movies.
Iron Man is probably the next best.
I would say Winter Soldier and then Iron Man.
Did you like the other Iron Man movies?
Not really, the third one was OK but the second one sucked.
I liked all of them but the first one is definitely the best.
What did you think of Doctor Strange?
I liked it. It wasn't one of my favorite though.
Yeah it was kind of like Ant-Man, pretty good but nothing special.
I did like special effects a lot.
Yeah, I'd have to watch it again.
I'm really excited for the new Thor movie, the trailer looks awesome.
Yeah Avengers: Infinity War is going to be the best though.
Oh yeah, for sure!
