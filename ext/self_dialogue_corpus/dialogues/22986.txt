whats your favorite jim carrey movie
probably dumb and dumber
that movie was okay.
it was stupid but definitely funny
the second movie was not nearly as good
but thats exactly what you would expect
you can't beat the classics
did you see eternal sunshine
that movie is absolutely amazing
that is probably my favorite
the way he was running against losing his memories
i saw it with my girlfriend
did she cry?
she was about to honestly.
aw, thats pretty cute though,
the movie is a cult classic now.
it was a very deep sentimental movie
its pretty beautiful how they decided to give it a second chance
hopefully they dont do a sequel
they wont.
