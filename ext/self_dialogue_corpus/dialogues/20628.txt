Hey, what do you think of all these super hero movies lately?
I love them man, I'm a huge fan of both marvel and DC.
Me too, what's been your favorite one so far?
I think I'd have to go with Suicide squad, I know a lot of people didn't like it, but I loved it.
I liked it, but I wouldn't say it's my favorite one lately.
Well, what's your favorite one?
Wonder woman! It was so good.
I haven't seen it yet, it seems more catered to women.
No man, it's so good.  Gal Gadot did an amazing job and I was hype the whole movie.
Really?  I might have to go see it.
You won't regret it.  What's been your least favorite one?
I'd have to say Batman vs Superman, it was boring and makes no sense to me.
Well, the wonder woman part in it was awesome, but besides that, I'm going to have to agree.
Yeah, the wonder woman part was cool, but how can a literal super hero not beat a rich guy easily.
Haha, I know what you mean.  It doesn't really make sense.
Not at all, Batman has no super powers! He's just rich and has cool things.
He does have his boxes where he keeps the superhero weaknesses though.
That's true, and back to wonder woman, she has no weakness, so she's probably the best.
RIght? She's awesome.
Yeah she is.
