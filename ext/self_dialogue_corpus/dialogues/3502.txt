Hi have you seen the movie Get out?
Yes it was great! It took horror movies to a new level.
I know and the twist at the end was great!
Have you seen any other horror movies in 2017?
I seen rings and it was ok. It really explained why the girl is the way she is.
Really? I think that series is overdone.
Yes but not as bad as Saw, did you hear there is going to be a Saw 8?
How ? Jigsaw is dead?
I am not sure but the plot said the killings will point back to him.
I may wait for the DVD because most people know the horror sequels are not great.
