Okay if you had to pick a side, whose side would you pick, Buzz or Woody?
Are you talking about the characters from Toy Story?
Yes now pick!
The whole point of the movie is to not pick sides but to be friends and work together.
I know that, this is only hypothetical. I would pick Buzz.
If I had to choose, I would pick Woody since he is such good friends with all the other toys like Rex, Slinky Dog, Hamm, Mr. Potato Head.
Yeah but Buzz can fly!
Or is it "falling with style"?
Very funny! I love that movie. Its such a great idea and story.
You have to give it up to Disney and Pixar. They make such good movies!
