Have you ever seen Aladdin?
Yes I have. It is one of my favorite Disney movies,
Who is your favorite character in the movie?
The Genie is by far my favorite. He is probably the funniest character in any of the animated Disney movies.
Who is the actor that plays him.
It's Robin Williams. He does a fantastic job.
He really is full of emotion in that movie.
What would be your favorite Disney movie?
I really liked Beauty and the Beast.
I hope I can get to see the new version of that movie that isn't a cartoon.
