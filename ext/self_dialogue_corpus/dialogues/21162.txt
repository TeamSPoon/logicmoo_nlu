Did you know Tarantino will stop making movies after 10?
10 what? 10 movies?
Yes.
How do you know?
It was on reddit a while ago.
You can't believe everything you read on reddit.
Yes, but this is legit, he said it himself. He will quit after making 10 movies.
That's so stupid, why would he do that?
I think it has to do with how he sees himself as an artist.
So the hateful eight was his 8th film? That's kinda convenient.
Seeing as how it sucked.
The hateful eight was the worst of his movies. If he's an artist quitting after 10 movies, he's not doing that well.
But I think the package of a director that quits at the height of his success is what he's going for.
Well, again, his last movie sucked, so he's not really at the height of his career.
That's a fair point, but it did make a lot of money.
How much?
155 million.
That's not much at all Kill Bill raked in 333 million.
Oh, and he considered Kill Bill 1 and 2 as one single film. So he can still make more movies after 10 if he makes prequels, sequel, etc
That's one weird dude, you know that?
