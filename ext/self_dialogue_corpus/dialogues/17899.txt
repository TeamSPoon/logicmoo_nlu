Do you like Katy Perry's music?
A couple songs.
Which ones?
Roar was an instant favorite the first time I heard it.
Why is that?
It just hits home with our inner animals and what we're capable of.
That's true.
Also it says to me at least that we should all be heard and to roar so to speak.
That's a good point never thought of it like that before.
Lots of deep meaning in the songs now days.
I wonder why back in the day they used to just out right say stuff.
I think it's to keep the rivalries and peace in check.
Could be.
What's your favorite?
Dark Horse I think.
I like that one too.
I love how she tries to be unique with her music.
She does a fantastic job with her music videos.
I agree.
Love her uniqueness more than anything else.
