What was the last movie you saw?
It was the Lego Batman movie.
Was it any good?
It was really good.
Better than the Lego Movie?
If you like Batman then, yes, but overall I'd say the lego movie is better.
Who's the bad guy in the Batman movie?
It has all of them but Joker is the main bad guy.
Joker is my favorite bad guy.
They did him really good in this movie.
Did they make he more of a clown?
Not really they kept him pretty serious.
Isn't it a kids movie?
Yeah, so the Joker is pretty funny too, but they didn't make him a goof ball.
Anything they did different with the movie?
They made Barbara Gordon the chief of police.
Why did they do that?
I think it was so they could have a female character.
It sounds like they stayed sort of close to the comics.
They did the best they could.  Overall it's a really good movie.
