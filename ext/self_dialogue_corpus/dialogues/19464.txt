Mom, I think you should turn the music down.
Honey, this is Soundgarden, you can't turn it down!
But it's so loud!
It's supposed to be. This was Chris Cornell back in the 90's, his vocals were amazing!
Chris Cornell, the guy that died recently.
Yes. That's why I'm listening to it, to honor his memory.
Ok. But it's really loud.
Wait til I get to Spoonman. I'm going to turn it up.
Mom, no. People are looking at us at stoplights.
Good, they are probably thinking what great music we are listening to.
After this we'll blast some Temple of the Dog, and finish it up with Audioslave.
I thought we were listening to that Chris guy?
We are, those are other bands he was in. I am the Highway by Audioslave is one of the best songs ever.
Mom, please turn it down. People will think we're weird.
You know, I spent the first half of my life with my parents telling me to turn it down, and now you are telling me to turn it down.
Well, maybe you should turn it down. You know, you're outvoted.
Or maybe I should turn it up and let you get rides from Grandma everywhere.
Grandma keeps making me listen to Bob Dylan, she says he'll change my life. But at least it's not too loud.
It's such a burden being cooler than your kids. Oh listen, Black Hole Sun is coming up.
I should start taking the bus.
