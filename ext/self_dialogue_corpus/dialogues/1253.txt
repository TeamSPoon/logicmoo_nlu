What do you think the chances of the Buffalo Bills are?
I like what they are doing long term, but this is a rebuiliding year.
I don't know, I like their talent and depth, I think they are a darkhorse.
At least rex is gone, but i think they are one year away.
Mcdermott is for real, the team had playoff talent with terrible coaching, with a good coach, I think that will be enough.
If not at least we have that extra first rounder and can get a franchise QB.
I dont think we need that, Taylor is good, and we have two good young QB's behind them.
That is another issue, if taylor gets hurt or doesnt work out, Jones or Peterman are not experienced enough.
McCoy is always good, the the reciever group is better form top to bottom if Watkins stays healthy
I agree Zay Jones was a steal in the draft.
The only real hole on offense is right tackle and Dawkins may fill that void.
Defense is a bigger concern.
They arent the same since 2014 but I still like the talent.
Front 7 is good if Dareus donest get in trouble again.
Ill admit, the defenisve backs worry me.
Yeah me too, especially safety, after hyde, it is very thin.
Hopefully everyone stays healthy, going to training camp?
I wont be able to make it, but I think I can get to a couple regaular season games.
Me too, I always try to catch one, maybe we can go to one together.
Yeah that would be a good idea.
