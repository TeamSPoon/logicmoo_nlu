Have you seen Taken?
With Liam Neeson?
Yes.
I have seen the first one, is there not like eight of them?
I think there are three. What did you think.
Well, I think he is a bad parent.
How so?
He keeps letting his kid get abducted.
But, that is the whole plot.
Well, the same thing over and over. Kid gets taken, he kills bad guys, gets the kid, ending.
