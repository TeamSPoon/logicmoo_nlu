What's your favorite Disney movie?
It's got to be Aladdin.
Wow, I love that one too, but I never knew that was your favorite.
I just love the Arabian Nights theme and the Genie.
It's very cool, and yes it does have the connection to old literature.
I find myself getting lost in the story every time.
Were you a kid when it came out in theaters?
Yes, that movie is a part of my childhood, and I have fond memories of going to see it.
I'm a little young to say that, but I still enjoyed watching it years later at home.
It's still good that way, and I make sure to watch it a couple times a year.
