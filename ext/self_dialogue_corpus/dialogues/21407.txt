What is the last movie you went to see?
My husband and I enjoyed going to see Wonder Woman a week ago!
Was it really good?
It was excellent! And so interesting because Gal Gadot was actually pregnant when shooting some of the scenes.
Wow that is quite impressive.
We were really impressed with the movie, very well put together and great acting.
Did you ever watch that movie based on a story about Desmond Doss?
You mean Hacksaw Ridge?
Yes that's the one! It was so good, very interesting.
I agree. He had a lot of courage, that is rare to see in Hollywood.
You're so right, it really is.
Do you like war movies?
Sometimes but not necessarily a huge fan.
I enjoy drama movies the most or romance.
Have you seen Fifty Shades of Grey?
Oh of course! A really great movie and interesting story line.
I agree, it really sucked me in.
Yes it did, I was hoping everything worked out between them.
Me too, they were so cute together.
There really were! Christian Grey was cute too.
