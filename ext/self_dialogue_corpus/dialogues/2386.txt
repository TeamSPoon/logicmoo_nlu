What NFL division do you think is the toughest out of them all?
You have to go with the AFC West as the strongest.
Why do you say that?
There's four teams in the division that could make the playoffs this year.
You really think the Los Angeles Chargers are going to make the playoffs?
I thnk they'll be greatly improved from last year.
They might be better but making the playoffs is a very bold prediction.
So which division do you think will be the strongest this coming year?
I'm going to go with the AFC South as the toughest division in the NFL.
That's a good choice, I think the AFC South is the very strong as well.
Jacksonville kind of lowers the rating of the division but the rest of the teams are all going to be fighting for the division championship.
Who are think is going to win the AFC South in 2017?
My opinion is that the Indianapolis Colts will take it in 2017.
How do you think Andrew Luck is going to do this year for the Colts?
He should have his usual numbers but I like Indianapolis' offensive line protecting Andrew Luck.
Yeah not enough is said for a strong offensive line. The quarterback gets all the glory but the offensive line makes it all possible.
The thing I don't like about the Colts is their defense. Their defense was terrible last year.
The way I see it, they can't possibly be worse so if they're just slightly better, then the Colts have a good shot to win the division.
If the Colts don't win, who is your second choice to win the AFC South?
I'd probably go with Houston repeating as division champs.
