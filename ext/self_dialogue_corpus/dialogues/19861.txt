Have you ever heard of Queensryche?
What a strange name, and no I haven't.
You might have actually heard some of their songs.
Really? Do they have stuff that goes on the radio?
Every now and then I'm sure, but only a song or two.
What's some of their other stuff?
They have some really good albums with interesting sounds.
Like which ones?
Empire is really good, there's a lot of really high quality stuff on there.
What's that sound like?
It's like good 80's rock with some pop.
Ah I like that.
Yeah that's their most popular album I think. That one was probably their last good one.
That's a shame. What are their other one's like?
Operation Mindcrime is one of the best, if not the best, metal albums of all time.
Wow that's pretty impressive. What else?
Rage for Order is another really good one.
Some very interesting album names.
Operation Mindcrime is a concept album too, so definitely listen to that one at least.
With a recommendation like that I'll have to.
