Do you remember MC Paul Barman?
Yeah, I used to listen to him when I was a teenager.
What was your favorite song of his?
I loved "Anarchist Bookstore Part 1."
That's a great song. So is "Anarchist Bookstore Part 2" by the way.
I also like "Talking Time Travel." I found that song very amusing.
Did you know that Questlove says Paul Barman is one of his top five rappers of all time?
Seriously? That's pretty crazy.
I know, I couldn't believe it when I heard him say that.
Well, Paul Barman is definitely very unique. You have to give him that.
