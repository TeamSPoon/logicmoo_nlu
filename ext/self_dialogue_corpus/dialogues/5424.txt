Did you ever see Finding Nemo?
Years and years ago.
What was the name of the fish from that movie?
Flounder?
No, that's Little Mermaid.
Nemo?
Of course not.  That's the movie title?
What fish are you talking about?  The blue one or the dad?
The blue fish he befriends.
Oh!  That's Dory!  The Dad is Marlin, do I get bonus points?
