Hey who is your favorite band?
Right now I'm really into nothing more
Oh yeah they are great,  I love the song Jenny.
Yeah that's my favorite,  but it's really sad when you think about it.
Really,  why is that?
The whole sing is about the singers mother and her dealing with her daughter's drug addiction while terminally ill.
Dude, that is a bummer.
Yeah but the band is really positive about helping people with mental issues because of it.
That's cool,  what other music is similar?
Any alternative rock really,  as lions,  I prevail... all awesome.
I prevail,  I've heard of them,  they covered Taylor swift didn't they?
Haha yeah don't even get me started on her.
Why,  do you not like pop music?
I did,  but now it's all pretty repetative.  I like ed Sheeran though,  he's great.
Yeah me too, I like the song he wrote for Lord of the rings.
What's that called again? I know I've heard it.
It's called I see fire.
That's right,  it's really cool.  I like that he tries to do everything himself without a band.
Yeah he's really talented.   Like a current day michael Jackson.
Wow... Just, no.  They are nothing alike,  don't ever compare them.
