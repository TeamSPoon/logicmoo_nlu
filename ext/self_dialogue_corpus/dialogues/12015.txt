What did you think of Roque One
I thought it was pretty awesome
Yeah, it was really good, even thought you knew the end game.
They, based on the original movies you know everyone dies, but it was still good.
Did you like "The Force Awakens" also
Yes, they finally got back to what Star Wars really is.
I liked most of it.  Parts of it were stupid.
Which parts were that?
When the girl, who didn't know she was a Jedi and had never trained, beat up Kylo Ren
Yeah, that part was a little lame.
