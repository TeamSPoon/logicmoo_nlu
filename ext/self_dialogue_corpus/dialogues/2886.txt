Ok, here's a question for you: What is the most overrated and most underrated NFL position?
You mean like in the organization or on the field?
Let's go with field position for now.
Ok, I'll bite. I will say the most overrated position is the Wide Receiver
Wide Receiver? What makes you think so?
They are a great weapon in the QB's arsenal, and I'm not saying they aren't important, but they get a lot more publicity as a part of the team.
See for me I think it's the QB who's most overrated.
Why? They are part of every play!
Just like with the WR, I'm not saying they aren't important, but a lot of what they do is a result of what the other players do.
That's true, you put Tom Brady behind a rookie line and he'll look like a rookie QB
Exactly, that's why I think Offensive Line positions are the most underrated.
Because they give the QB the opportunity he needs to make the pass?
Exactly, Manning's last years with Denver show this. If he had time in the pocket and good routes, he was the best QB ever.
Exactly, but when the OL had all those injuries and restructures his rating fell bad.
I know, but they always act like it's all the QB.
Yep, and for me I would say Punter or kicker is most underrated.
Interesting, why those ones?
The punter makes the difference in a game so often by determining field position and a great punter can end another team.
Oh yeah, a punt followed by a safety is brutal.
Don't forget what a 50 yard field goal can do in a close game either and that kind of precision is not common.
