Do you like Bon Jovi?
Of course I like Bon Jovi! He's one of my favorite artists of all time!
I wouldn't go that far, but I think he's one of my favorite rock artists of the eighties at the very least.
That's fair enough, but Living on a Prayer was so iconic!
I think that was his best song.
Do you think so? I liked Shot Through the Heart.
I'd forgotten about that one. They used to play that at dances in high school, right?
I think so sometimes.
How do you even dance to rock music?
You bang your head up and down!
