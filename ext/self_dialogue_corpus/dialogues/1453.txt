Last year the Rams moved to LA. The Chargers moved to LA starting in 2017.
A move I hate, by the way.
Do you?
Yes, I would rather see other places get NFL teams than LA get two.
They nearly could have had three, but the Raiders will be going to Las Vegas in 2020.
That move I don't mind so much. Nevada didn't have an NFL team, so it's nice to see them get one.
OK then. If you could move two or three NFL teams or create expansion teams, where would you like to see them?
For starters, I would move either the Rams or Chargers back out of LA.
Move one of them to Oakland or San Diego?
Maybe, yeah. I'd also like to see old NFL teams revived, at least in spirit.
A lot of those defunct teams were in small towns that I don't think would be able to support a modern NFL franchise, though.
I suppose so, but I'm thinking dream teams, not the reality of how they would work. So, Akron, Racine, Louisville.
Canton had a team at one point too, yeah? That would be a great option for a team.
The Canton Bulldogs were a team in the 20s, yes. It would be nice to see the town with the Hall of Fame have a team now.
Outside of old defunct teams, where would you put a modern franchise?
Oregon, maybe. New Mexico. Oklahoma.
What about expanding outside of the continental US?
I've always thought a Hawaii team would be neat, but travel would be an issue.
I'd love to see a Mexican or Canadian team. International, but close enough so travel shouldn't be a huge deal.
Those would be really fun options.
