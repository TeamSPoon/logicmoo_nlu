What is in style this season?
I've been seeing a lot of shoulder baring tops lately!
Ah, kind of an 80s throwback?
Definitetly. I'm feeling those Flashdance vibes. I've also seen a lot of bright colorful stripes.
I love that color is in right now, I was so ready for it! I've also seen a lot of large bags on the runways.
YES, that is so great for those of us who carry around everything but the kitchen sink. Do you like the utilitarian trend?
Honestly, I don't like anything khaki.
Oh, me either. It's so boring. There are some interesting shapes, though.
I really love the statement t-shirts I've been seeing.
I do too, what a great way to show personality! It also helps that they are comfortable. And the big earrings!
I love a good statement piece. I can't believe platform shoes are back, though.
I know, it feels very 90s. Not my favorite style decade.
I agree - give me 70s inspired fashion anyday!
I'm more of an 80s gal myself. Those colors! I'm also really loving the exposed bra trend.
Me too! We spend so much on bras, it's time to show them off!
I'm not sure how I feel about the athletic wear trend, though.
I don't care for it - it definitely doesn't suit me. I think it would take an athletic person to look natural in those clothes.
It's definitely not for everyone, that's for sure. I'm just glad there are so many different things going on in fashion right now!
Me too, there's something for everyone. I'm going to be rocking the bare shoulders all summer.
I'll join you!
