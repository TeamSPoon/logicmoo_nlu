What is a key grip, anyway?
A grip is a person who holds up scenery and stuff like that. The key grip is the head one.
Who holds up the actors' heads?
Yes, that's exactly right.
Okay, so what's a gaffer? A really, really old grip?
They handle the lighting. There's some... historical reason for the term, that I forget.
Is that where we get gaffer tape?
Presumably, yes, as it covers all the stuff they do. They do all kinds of electrical stuff, but the focus is on lighting.
I get what a runner is. Uh, Foley?
A sound engineer who creates all of the "body sounds" you hear -- like clothes rustling, footsteps, bumping into stuff. Named after a prominent one -- Bob, I think?
So they don't do, like, laser blasts or explosions? Just people bumping into each other?
More or less. People make a ton of subtle noises, and it seems weird when we don't hear them.
What if a character were to, like, throw something?
That might count. Probably. I mean, it's not going to be that clear cut all the time. Depends on context.
So there wouldn't be a labor issue? Like, the lead sound engineer complains because the foley guy is doing his job for him?
No, probably not -- but, you know, it's hard to generalize. It depends on what's happening.
I know that sometimes people flip out if another crew member, like, moves a cup when they're not supposed to.
It sounds ridiculous, but it's kind of like civil litigation -- you need to protect your space or else other people will take it over and claim precedent for when you failed to stop someone before.
So you don't want a squatter doing grip work.
No, the squatters do something totally different.
