Do you like Adam Sandler movies?
Yes, I liked Happy Gilmore a lot
Yeah, that was probably his best one. I just saw it the other day on cable
How does it hold up?
It's pretty good. Some parts are out of date, but over all it's good
Do you remember Billy Madison?
Yes, that one was silly.
But really funny as well.
I haven't seen it in a long time.
Some great cameos in that one, including Chris Farley.
Wasn't he the bus driver?
Yes, and he kept getting upset about the kids in the bus. Almost loses it.
Something about a banana peel as well?
Yes, someone throws in out and then the O'doal family drives over it...
And they end up crashing.
Yes, that's it a random part in the movie
Yes, most scenes in that one were random
Which made it even more funny
I guess, depends on your sense of humor.
That's true. Which is all comedy in a sense.
