So the best movie series of all time will be airing this weekend on tv!
Oh yeah?  What is that?
The Back To the Future Trilogy!
Oh man, I love those movies!  When is it coming on?
It starts Saturday at four p.m. and they will run all Saturday night.
Those are truly the greatest.  I wish they would re-make them and we could see new versions.
You mean new versions of the same story, or like a continuation set in modern times?
I don't know, both would be cool!
I disagree!  I think the originals are great just like they are.
Well, Michael J. Fox really was amazing.  I guess they wouldn't be the same without him.
No, and the crazy thing as that they are set in the future which is like here now!
Oh yeah, it's wild to think that that was how they envisioned the world today.
Imagine if we had hovercrafts and those tiny pizzas that they warmed up!
Yeah, well we don't have those things but we do have lots of similar crazy technology.
Yeah, you're right.  Well those movies are timeless.
I can't ever get sick of watching them.  I guess if they made one now, it'd be set in the late 21st century?
Yeah, like 2050 or something like that.  It'd be bizarre.
It would have to take place on another planet because we probably will have destroyed this one by then.
Nah, it could still take place on earth.  Who would they get to play Michael J. Fox's role, though?
I don't know.  I can't keep up with all these young actors anymore.
