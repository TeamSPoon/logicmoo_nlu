What do you think of Taylor Swift?
I don't really have an opinion because I'm not much interested in country music.
Actually, I don't think she is a country music artist anymore.
What do you mean?
I mean her music is now mostly pop, I guess.
That's nice, I'm a big fan of pop music.
She's got a few new hit songs, you would probably like them.
Maybe, what's her new pop album called?
Her new album is titled 1989 and is the reason I've actually become a fan of her.
You think the music is that good?
No, it's because of the bonus tracks on the album where you can see some of her song writing process.
And why does that make you more of a fan?
Because I feel like a lot of pop artists now days aren't actually writing their own music in any way.
You mean they hire people to play the music?
To play it, yes, and in some cases to write the music and the lyrics even.
I guess a person who does that wouldn't be an artist, but probably just a singer.
I completely agree and I'm always excited to see some indication that artists are indeed artists, like Taylor Swift.
You talking about this makes me quite interested in hearing her new music.
I can let you listen to some of it if you like, then you can decide for yourself.
That would be great, thanks!
