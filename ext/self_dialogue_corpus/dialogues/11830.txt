I've been listening to the Beatles a lot lately.
Oh? What are some of their best songs?
Here Comes the Sun is one of the best. It is so cheerful and happy.
Oh yeah that is a good one. It always makes me feel happy.
Baby You Can Drive My Car is cute as well. What are your favorites?
Help! is such a classic. So is All You Need is Love.
Great choices. What about Yellow Submarine?
Also good, but not my favorite. Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da is probably my all-time favorite.
Oh I love how silly Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da is!
Me too. It always makes me lighten up when I'm being too serious!
