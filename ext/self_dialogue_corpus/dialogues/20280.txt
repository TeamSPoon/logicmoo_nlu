What was the most overrated movie you've ever seen?
I guess there's quite a few that come to mind.
Try to narrow it down to just one.
Just one?  That's not an easy task.
Well, enlighten me.
Okay, I'll say E.T.
Interesting choice.
I just don't think the film was that great to be honest.
It was a very 80's movie for sure.  Many iconic parts though.
You mean him saying 'Phone home?'
Not just that, but eating Reeses, the flying bicycle...
I know what you mean, but how much of that was deserved?
I don't consider it one of Spieberg's best films.
That's what I'm saying.
That being said, I don't think it was overrated.  It was just a good flick that others love more than us.
But that's the very definition of overrated.
Again, it's iconic though, not overrated.
I would much rather watch Alien if we're talking about extra-terrestrials.
Wow, now that's a 180 degree turn.
Just telling you how it is.
