Where you suprised that Aniken Skywalker is Darth Vader?
Totally. In revenge of the sith I can't belive he killed all of the Jedi recuits.
Yeah I was suprised. That is when I understoid why Jedis were not supposed to have romantic relationships.
Yeah someone that powerful would do anything for the person they love.
But would you ever be temped to go to the dark side?
Totally they have no rules. Jedis have too many rules.
I don't know. That's what keeps them in check.
Too many rules. If they didn't have all those rules Qui Gon Jin could have had a second apprentice and maybe Anikien would not have gone to the dark side.
That is very interesting. Do you thing Obi Wan was not ready?
Yes. They gave him a powerful boy who was too old.
