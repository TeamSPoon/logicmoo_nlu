It's nearly football season again
I can't wait
I know, I get all pumped up inside thinking about it
I need to place an order for some football gear pretty soon
Oh yeah, that's right.  I want a new Lion's hat.
HAHAH.  Lion's huh?  That's cute.
What?  They play every Thanksgiving you know.
Yeah yeah....and what's their record I wonder.
Well, I don't know, I don't follow them that closely.  My kid wants a fidget spinner too.
Yeah, I need to get a Brown's, Colt's, Patriot's, and a (shudder) Jet's fidget spinner when I place my order.
Wow...why so many?
All the kids.  They all want one, even the two adult children.  Can you believe it?
Hopefully they will include a season schedule this time.
For what?  The Pats?
Yeah.
Why don't you just download the app to your fancy phone?
I dunno.  I like looking at something I can keep in my wallet.
Yeah, but the app is cool cause you can set reminders and preferences.  It's handy.
I dunno.  Does it cost?
Nope...do it today!
