Did you know that Usher helped jump start Justin Beibers music career?
No, but I still love Usher's hit "Yeah."
True or False. The girl group named "The Ronettes" are sisters?
I think that's false. Did you know Sister Sledge of "We Are Family" fame had a lot of in group fighting.
I heard one the Sledge sisters recently died. I hope it wasn't the one who sang lead on "He's The Greatest Dancer."
It was Jonie that pass and it was "Kathy Sledge" that sang lead for the group.
Wow! Did you know Niles Rogers of "Le Freak" and "Chic" fame produced several Sister Sledge songs.
Yes I did know that. Nile Rogers also produced David Bowie on "Let's Dance."
I think Pharell recently did some Pop work with Nile Rogers.
Pharell got in some copyright trouble with that Thicke guy for their pop version of "Blurred Lines."
