What do you think of the Force Awakens?
I think it is a shameless rip off of A New Hope.
I completely agree. Even down to Kylo Ren killing Hans Solo.
And blowing up the Death Star by doing a jump shot.
Hey, at least they made Rougue One to explain why there is a flaw
Yeah, that was a really good movie.
And since everyone dies, we won't have any sequels.
Or ill-concieved prequels.
The Revenge of the Sith was ok.
It was seriously the only one they needed to make.
