What's your favorite part of an NFL gameday experience?
Oh that's a tough one, I love a bunch of things.
For me, it's the tailgating and the food.
Okay, that's definitely my favorite thing too.
There's just so many foods and drinks that I enjoy before I go into the game.
Yes, but I try to take it easy so I can still enjoy the ballgame.
One time, I ate so much at the stadium that I spent the whole game with a stomach ache.
Oh no, that would be no fun at all.
It wasn't fun, and it was an overtime game, so it lasted even longer and I couldn't go home.
I have to say that my second favorite thing about going to an NFL game is the crowd.
You really enjoy all those people?
Oh yeah. Why wouldn't I love being in a big crowd?
It takes a long time to park, drive, and get to your seat.
Yes, but it feels great to be a part of 70,000 people cheering or booing.
I guess it is cool and unique to be among a crowd with that sheer size.
You're not going to experience that feeling in a lot of other places, so you might as well enjoy it.
I went to a New York Jets game last year, and the crowd was rowdy and rude.
That can happen at certain NFL stadiums, but for the most part the people are really nice.
I guess when I go to a game this year I will have to learn to appreciate the people around me more.
Try it, because it creates a great sense of community and togetherness while cheering for your team.
