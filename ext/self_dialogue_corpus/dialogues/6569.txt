Do you realize that there is almost never a mother in Disney movies?
What do you mean, there is a mom and dad in Inside Out?
True, but what in Finding Nemo, the mom dies in that movie?
Ok, that true and there is no mom in The Little Mermaid either.
Yep, and in Beauty and the Beast we never see Belle's mom at all.
Yeah, I don't even know if she is supposed to be dead or what.
I think so. And there's the classics of course.  Cinderella doesn't have a mom.
Yeah and neither does Snow White.
And we can't forget the biggest one - Bambi.
Well, technically Bambi had a mom for a little while during the movie.
