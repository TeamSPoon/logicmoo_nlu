Do you think Snow White ever forgot any of the dwarves names?
Maybe at first. But they are all pretty specific.
There were seven dwarves right?
Yes and they all were named after different attributes.
Name all of the dwarves then.
Dopey, Sleepy, Grumpy, Bashful, Happy...
Can't think of the other two can you?
I can! They're on the tip of my tongue!
Doc and Sneezy!
I can't believe I forgot! I'm such a Dopey.
