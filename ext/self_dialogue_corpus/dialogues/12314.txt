its so weird that kylo was taught by luke
yeah, and he was the son of han solo
but he wants to be like his grandfather
who>
darth vader
oh yeah, his mom is leia
that is really strange
even vader would have told him to stay with the jedis too though
he is stupid and seems like he's in a rebellious phase
but its weird both the sith and jedi are in him
