Didn't Star Wars come out in the 80's?
Nope, 1997 to be exact.
Really?  I thought it was newer than that.
The visual effects were just that revolutionary for the time.
I disliked how they updated them on some of the newer DVD releases.
A lot of the old fans were turned off by them.
They just missed the nostalgia.
I'm fine either way.  I still have copies on VHS.
Wow, you are a true fan.
You know it!
