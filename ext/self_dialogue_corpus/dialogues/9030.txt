Do you listen to a lot of southern rock?
Classic southern rock?  Yeah.
Who do you like to listen to the most?
Well, lately I've been listening to the Allman Brothers.
Oh, they had some good music.  It's a shame Duane Allman died so young.
Yeah, he was an awesome musician.
What are your favorite songs by them?
I love Midnight Rider, even though that's cliche to say.
That's an awesome song.
Yeah, it's been covered a lot too.
