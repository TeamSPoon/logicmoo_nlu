Bambi was a really sweet movie.
Wasn't though, that was one of Disney's early movies.
Yea. I felt so bad for Bambi when he mom died.
Me too.
Disney animation is so superb.
ANd the colors are incredible.
Do you remember what year it came out?
Yes, 1942. My mom was only 9 years old at the time.
I find it amazing that Disney movies are always popular no matter how old they are.
Yea me too.
They really do stand the test of time.
My mother saw Bambi, I saw Bambi,my kids saw it and now my grandkids.
And it is still good!!
I love all the little animals in it too.
Especially Thumper.
Yea he was adorable.
I wonder what Disney will think up next?
I do not know but I am sure it will be a block buster.
Yea me too.
They usually are.
