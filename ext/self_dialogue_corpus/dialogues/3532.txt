Have you seen the trailer for the new Annabelle movie?
With that creepy little doll?
That comes to life. Yep.
That movie freaked me out!
It is a possessed doll.
In this one she like haunts an orphanage right?
Yep, and I think possess a kid or two.
Doll scary movies are always so scary!
Like Chucky.
And The Bride of Chucky.
