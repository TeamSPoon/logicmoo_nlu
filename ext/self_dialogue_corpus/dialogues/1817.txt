Who is your favorite NFL player?
Tough to say, current or all time?
Current first.
Wow that's really tough. I would have to say Odell Beckham.
Not a bad choice I suppose.
Why who would you pick?
Im joining the AP train.
Adrian Peterson? What has he done recently?
Just you wait and see.
We've all been waiting for a few years now, he hasn't been the same since the scandal.
He hasn't been on the right team either.
You think he is now?
I think the Saints are a better place for him to showcase his talents.
Maybe, but he is never going to be the same he used to be.
You don't know that, you only like Beckham because he's popular now.
That's not true, I like Beckham because he makes incredible plays look easy.
Almost none of those look easy.
The way he catches those balls they sure do.
At least Peterson is a tough guy who can take a hit.
Oh would you stop it, Beckham can take a hit too.
