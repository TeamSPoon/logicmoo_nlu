So, recently I saw the Spongebob Squarepants movie.
Which one?  Wasn't there two of them?
Now that you mention it yeah... I saw the more recent one... Sponge Out of Water I think or something like that.
What did you think?
I was really, really disappointed.  The trailer made it look a LOT funnier than it was.
Well, they can do that sometimes.
I mean, it has all these quick edits, had Antonio Banderas playing an over the top villain, Guns N' Roses "Welcome To The Jungle", all making it seem like a pretty exciting stuff.
Yeah, so what went wrong?
Oh, man, where to begin?  For starters, the part of them going into the real world does NOT occur until about an HOUR into the movie
Wow, that's a bit of  wait!
I know!  The trailer makes it seem like all (or at least most) of the film is going to take place in the "real" world, but it doesn't.
I think I heard someone mention that as well...
Yeah, and then get this, a lot of the jokes they had were edited so that they were less funny than in the travel.
What do you mean?
Well, there's a scene in the trailer where Patrick is on the beach and he looks up and sees a girl in a bikini eating an ice cream cone, right?
Yeah.
So, he gets hearts in his eyes and he's like, "Where have you been all my life!" And he jumps towards her and lands... right on her ice cream cone.
Oh, so it wasn't the girl he was looking at?
No.  But in the movie, they have that line, but they don't set it up like that.  They just have look at something off-screen, then cut to a ice cream shop.  Totally negating the joke.
Sounds like they dropped the ball on that one.
