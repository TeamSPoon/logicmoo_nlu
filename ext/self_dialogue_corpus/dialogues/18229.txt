Yes, do you remember any of their music?
Here I go again if I recall correctly.
That's correct.
Why do you bring them up?
I was just listening to some of their music and though of you.
Why did you think of me?
I remember we talked about music the other day.
That's right.
Also, they're one of my fovorites.
I do remember listening to them a long time ago.
Do you remember is this love?
No, I didn't know they had a song titled that.
