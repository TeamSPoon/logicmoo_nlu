There is a new horror movie out.
Ok those are rare, when they have good reviews, in modern times.
Yes that is true.
What is it about.
The guy from Key & Peele did it?
So is it a comedy?
It combines most every element of a film.
Ok that sounds great.
Yes it is a great horror film also, Get Out is the name.
Ok thanks for telling me.
