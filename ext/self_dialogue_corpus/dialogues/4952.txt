Did you watch the Pirates almost have a no hitter thrown against them the other night?
No I missed it, who were they playing?
The Diamond Backs, their pitch Greinke took a no hitter into the 8th.
No kidding, who finally got on?
Polanco finally hit a homerun in the 8th to end it.
Wow, they are doing horrible right now.
I know, they are having a severe batting slump.
McCutcheon has been struggling a lot.
I know, they all have.
They have some pretty young players right now, don't they.
Yeah, their pitching staff is very young right now but they have been doing okay.
Really?
Yeah, they are at least keeping them in close games.
Not getting blown out.
No, the games are close they just aren't hitting to score any runs.
I wonder if they will be able to turn it around.
I don't know, sometimes I can't bring myself to watch.
I know.
They have been making alot of defensive errors also.
I know, they suck right now.
