I going to Disney World for vacation, but I haven't seen any of the movies.
Well you certainly can't watch all of them now.  You'll never finish.
Which one should I watch first?
Well, if you are going to Disney World, I would watch CInderella.
Why is that?
Well, Her castle is in the middle of the park.
I guess it is also a pretty famous one.
It is a classic.  It has a beautiful story, and the music is amazing.
Isn't that where "A Dream Is A Wish Your Heart Makes" is from?
That's right.  It is a beautiful song.
