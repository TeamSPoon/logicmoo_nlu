Who was the better Mary Jane you think?
Well, I think Emma Stone was better, but Kirsten Dunst is cuter.
Nah.  Emma's got that deep voice that's perfect.
But Kirsten has a better figure overall.
No way!  She's got a snaggletooth.
Oh please.  Like that would stop you.
Listen, I know who I would want as my Mary Jane and it ain't Dunst.
That's fine.  You can have Emma and I'll have the real beauty.
You should watch the newer movies and you'd think differently.
Fat chance.
