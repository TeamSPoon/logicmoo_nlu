Do you want to go see Brad Paisley with me?
Yes, I love him!
Me too, have you seen his new music video?
Last time for everything? Yes!
Oh I was talking about Selfie.
Oh I haven't seen that one.
It's so freaking funny. You need to watch it!
Okay, haha
I love his videos! I will never forget the music video for online
Which one was that again?
it went: I'm so much cooler online
Oh yeah, I remember that one, that was forever ago wasn't it?
Like ten years ago I think
Damn, we're getting old.
Don't remind me.
Weren't there a bunch of really big actors in that music video?
YES! William Shatner was in it and the guy from Seinfeld.
I thought so.
I hope he plays it at the concert!
Me too!
