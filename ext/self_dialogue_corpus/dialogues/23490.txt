What;s the last good movie you saw?
I saw the movie Logan about a week ago.
Is that the movie about Wolverine from the Xmen?
Yeah, exactly.
How was it? I heard it was not the typical Xmen movie.
It wasn't anything like the typical Xmen movie. It was alot more graphic and gruesome.
Oh...I see.  Sounds like more of an adult Xmen movie.
Yes, even though the only characters from Xmen were Professor X and Wolverine (Logan).
I might have to check it out.  The last good movie I saw was Star Wars Rogue One.
I heard it was a good movie, even though it wasn't really part of the Star Wars Trilogy.
Actually it was a story from the time shortly after Anakin becomes Darth Vader.
I'm not really a Star Wars fan, so alot of the characters and lingo is lost on me.
Even if you not a Star Wars fan, you could still watch this movie and keep up without being too lost.
Yeah, I guess I can relate, because when I saw Logan I went with my girlfriend who has never seen an Xmen film.
Really? How did she like it?
She loved the movie.  She was able to follow along as if the movie had no ties to any of the characters being Xmen.
That's how Rogue One was.  Films like that make people who are not familiar with a particular movie series, interested in seeing the old films.
Yeah, I guess you're right.  I had never seen any of the Iron movies, until I started watching the Captain America films.
Exactly what I'm talking about. Iron man, Captain America, The Avengers, and now Spiderman all tie into each other.
You're right....I may have to go back and start viewing the old Star Wars movies
