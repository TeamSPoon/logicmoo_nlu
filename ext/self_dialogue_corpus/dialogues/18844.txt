Man this is crazy heavy
What is
Oceanos newest album
It is pretty awesome i dig it
I love it
Cool
I mean it absolutely crushes period
Its not as good as their first two though
Well yeah those are masterpieces
The breakdowns are heavy though
Its like an earthquake
I know right
I need to see them live
That would be awesome
One of the few bands i like i havent yet
Well next time they tour you should
Long as you come with
Sure thing
Cool man
Sounds promising
