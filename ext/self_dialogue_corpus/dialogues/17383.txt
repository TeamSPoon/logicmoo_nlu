Do you like The Used?
I cant recall who they are.
They are led by Bert McCracken.
Oh ok the mormon band?
They might be from Utah but I doubt they are mormon.
OK what was the slower song they had that kind of got big?
It was called Blue and Yellow
OK yeah I loved that song!
At the time, the lyrics were awesome.
What was the name of their first album?
Taste of Ink is what you are thinking of.
I thought that was their first single.
Yeah maybe it was self titled.
Either way, the song was great.
Yeah the lead singer used to date Kelly Osbourne.
Did he use that to get his band fame?
No they wrote a solid debut album.
The follow up wasnt bad but nowhere near as good.
Some bands cant outlast their debuts
They are a perfect case of that example
