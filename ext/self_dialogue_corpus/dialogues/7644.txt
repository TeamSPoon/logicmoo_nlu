So are you going to watch the Harry Potter weekend marathon?
I totally am!
I'm still sad about Snape's death in movie and real life.
Me too, Snape was a great character.
I always thought he was a dark character, but he had good in him.
So true, as the movies progressed we saw more about his struggles.
Exactly!
And by the Half blood Prince we saw why he seems to dislike Harry.
That was so sad that he was in love with Lily Potter but she didn't feel the same.
God I love these movies!
