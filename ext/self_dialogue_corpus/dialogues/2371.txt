What's the projection for the nest year? Who's the best team?
That's hard to say.
Guess. Or make an educated guess.
Now that's even harder. Educated guesses in this scenario require us to look at the team's strengths and weakness and whether or not the draft did anything.
I think Dak Prescott is going take the Cowboys to the Superbowl
Hah. No way man. Prescott is good, but not that good. I can see the cowboys winning their division, but probably won't get past the conference championship
Who do yo think will win the NFC then?
Either the Packers or Seahawks. Unless they both get a bunch of injuries, then Cowboys might win the NFC
That's a very real possibility.
yeah, but it's also very real possibility that Cowboys may suffer injuries as well. So...
Huh. man, I want the Cowboys to win the superbowl so bad, they haven;'t been to one in years
Last one was back in 1996. They've won that
That was the triple X game. That was hilarious.
Roman numerals suck. They should just change to numbers.
no way man, it's a tradition.
They didn't stick with the tradition for the 50th, now it's pointless
I don't know I think it's cool. Anyway. So who's gonna win the AFC? Pats again?
That's what I'm thinking. They got picked up Brandin Cooks to add to their receiving core.
I think Cooks is overated. he only ranks high because Brees loves to throw and Cooks is his favorite target
That just says he's a good receiver...
