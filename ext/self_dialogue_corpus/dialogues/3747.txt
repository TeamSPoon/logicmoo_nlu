Name your favorite thriller movie of all time.
It has to be the Sixth Sense.
Why do you say that?
It is what started it all for M. Night.
I agree. It also started the whole twist thing in movies.
Yes, the twist at the end was shocking.
It was one of the few movies I actually liked Bruce willis in.
I agree, he gave an amazing performance.
It was one of the more creepier movies I've seen.
I watched it as a child, and didn't sleep a week after that without a light on.
