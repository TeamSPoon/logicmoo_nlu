What do you think of Brittany Spears?
I think she had her days years ago.
She now struggles very hard to simply get by.
Not financially though.
No but her image was damaged all those years ago.
I think she is a respectable woman now.
I couldn't agree more she turned her life around.
Sadly people will only ever see that picture of her bald when they think of her.
Didn't she do that for charity though?
Yes but people didn't understand that at the time.
I wonder if she came out now if she would be popular like when she first started.
It's very likely, people still like her older music.
She knew exactly how to make sales in the music industry.
She was pretty and had a beautiful voice.
She was more than that though she was smart and determined.
That's true.
She was a good singer and likely still is.
Just wish her reputation wasn't so damaged.
All it takes it one mistake.
That's true.
