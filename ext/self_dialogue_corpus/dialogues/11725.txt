My mom once thought that Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds was an Elton John song.
Really?
Yeah, turns out he did a cover version that I hadn't known about. I had said it was a Beatles song. We were both right, in a way.
That's funny!
So do you have any good stories about Beatles songs?
Yeah. I made a friend on this online game. He sent me Here Today. It was cool. We lost touch because he got busy with college.
Do you miss him?
Yeah, he was going to teach me his native language.
Sorry about that.
It's okay, it was a long time ago.
