What kind of music did your parents listen to while you were growing up?
Why?
I'm writing a paper on how that influences musical taste.
Oh, okay. Hmm. Well, my mother was really into Jewel and Sarah McLachland
Wow. So I guess your road trips weren't so great as a kid?
Not really. My Dad was into classic rock though--The Beatles, Bob Dylan, that sort of thing.
Do you like that sort of music?
I still listen to Bob Dylan from time to time. I was happy when he won a Nobel Prize.
Okay. And what sort of things do you listen to now?
I listen to a lot of jazz. Miles Davis, Nat King Cole, that sort of thing.
That's very different from both of them!
I can't explain it.
Interesting. Well, this will be useful for my paper!
Have you asked anyone else about this yet?
A few people! They were all pretty interesting.
Which one had the weirdest response.
There was one girl who said her mom was super into Iron Maiden.
I can't imagine what that childhood must of been like.
And now she listens to ordinary pop music!
I guess she's being rebellious in her own way!
