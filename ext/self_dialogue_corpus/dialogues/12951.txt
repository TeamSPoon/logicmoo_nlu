Which character in the recent Star Wars movies did you like better? Rey or Jyn Erso?
That's a tough question. I really like both Daisy Ridley and Felicity Jones and both characters Rey and Jyn went through so much as children.
I think Jyn went through more. She basically was broken and angry, where I think Rey accepted her life and made the most out of it.
That's kind of true. I can see Rey less broken and just along for the ride and then learning about herself, while Jyn basically had her parents taken away from her and was battling a cause that was beyond her skills.
Don't forget Rey has the Force, she just doesn't know it yet. So in essence she has a guiding power that is watching over her. Jyn is a pretty normal human. Her courage and her bravery is what sets her apart from everyone else.
You make a compelling argument for Jyn there, so I'm guessing you like Jyn from Rogue One better than Rey from Force Awakens.
I like them both! They've been my favorite modern Star Wars characters to date.
Sad we won't get more Jyn.
Well we have Rey to look forward to, but I think Jyn definitely solidifies my ranking for her as my favorite character between those too but Rey still has a series to go to catch up for me!
I can't wait for the follow up to Force Awakens. The reveal with Luke Skywalker at the end of Force Awakens was so exciting and surprising!
