Are you a fan of Spider-Man?
Spider-Man?  Yea, he's one of my favorite superheroes.
Then I have a question.  Why's there another movie being made, with a different actor?
Well besides money, the main reason is that this will be the first time Marvel Studios makes their own Spider-Man movie.
I'm confused.  Aren't all the Spider-Man movies by Marvel?
'Spider-Man' the character belongs to Marvel, but Sony Pictures previously retained the rights to the movie franchise.
I see.  So Marvel's own in-house studio is making it this time.
That's correct.  Which is why Spider-Man can now exist in the same universe as the rest of the Marvel movie characters.
What do you think about the new actor?
Tom Holland?  He might be my favorite actor to have played Spider-Man.
Really?
Yea.  Not only was he great in 'Captain America: Civil War,' but he's also the first Spider-Man to actually be high-school age.
Good point.  Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield were both way too old to play teenagers.
Did you like the Spider-Man movies?
I wouldn't say I'm a big superhero genre fan, but I really loved 'Spider-Man' 1 and 2.
Those were classics.  They helped jump start the so-called "Golden Age" of superhero movies.
I hope they do a good job with this new one.
I think they will.  Marvel Studios hasn't had a flop yet.
That's a great point.  There's definitely consistency in terms of successes.
Let's hope that doesn't stop any time soon!
