Did you ever see the Disney movie Up?
I sure did and I'm one of the people who cried within the first five minutes.
They knew they were pulling on our heartstrings with that one.
The story of the old couple and how they grew up together was so heartwarming.
That's true, you could definitely understand his demeanor after seeing that.
I think Disney and Pixar make a great team when they get together.
It's the best alliance in Hollywood in my opinion.
That's for sure. Did you know they're coming out with a new The Incredibles?
It's about time! People have been crying for a sequel for years.
I'm one of them. I hope Samuel L. Jackson's character Frozone comes out in this one again.
