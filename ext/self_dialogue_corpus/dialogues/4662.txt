How about Chris Sale?
The guy is on fire right now.
He is still a headache to front offices.
Yeah but his talent.
He definitely has it but he pains people.
I think they look the other way.
I dont know eventually they wont do it.
8th straight 10 strikeout game.
Thats hard to pass up.
Think he gets the next mega contract?
I dont know I feel like hes going to have to negotiate his deal every year.
Yeah he might be one of those guys that only runs the 3 year deal every time.
He really talked his way into it.
I am sure the White Sox are glad hes not around anymore.
Not only them but the AL Central.
Well they only faced him every 5th day and the White Sox are good.
I am shocked Pedoria doesnt keep him in line.
Hes not a huge team leader.
I think he is
Not in the sense he would ruffle the pitchers feathers.
