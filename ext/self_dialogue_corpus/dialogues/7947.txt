Carly Rae Jepsen might be my favorite pop artist going right now.
Yeah it's really hard to argue with the greatness of Emotion.
Yeah I feel like a lot of people wrote her off after Call Me Maybe.
Which was a definite mistake, Emotion is a pop classic.
Her new single is sounding good too.
Agreed, do you know who is producing?
I'm not sure, I know I saw Jack Antonoff's name thrown around a bit.
I don't think it's him, but I know he worked with her in the past.
So did Butch Walker so she is on a roll with collaborations.
Can't wait for her new album in full followed by a tour.
