Oh my gosh, guess what?
What is it?
I just got two tickets to see a Dustin Lynch concert!
Dustin Lynch? Who is that?
He is one of the newer country singers. He is awesome!
Cool! Maybe I have heard some of his songs and just didn't know, what are some of them?
Small Town Boy, Mind Reader, Hell of a Night, and She Cranks My Tractor.
Wait a minute, is he the one that sings the song Cowboys and Angels?
Yes he is the one that sings that. I love that song!
Oh my gosh that is one of my most favorite songs. I had no idea who sang it.
Yeah he has a lot of other great songs. I can't wait to see him in concert.
What is your most favorite song if his?
He has one called Your Daddy's Boots and it is probably the best of all of them.
Wait, I think I have heard that one before.
You probably have heard a lot of his songs and you just didn't know that it was him.
Yeah, more than likely. So far I like everything that I know is his.
Would you like to come to the concert with me so you can check out his other songs.
Yes! That would be amazing.
Great! It will be such an awesome concert.
I can't wait to hear more of his songs and see him in person.
