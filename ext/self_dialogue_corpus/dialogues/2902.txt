How do you think the Miami Dolphins are going to do this year?
I'm not expecting much out of them as usual. They're always kind of mediocre.
Yeah it must be disappointing to be a Dolphins fan. It's like the organization doesn't even try.
From my experience, Dolphins fans aren't as passionate about their team as other fanbases.
Yes I've been to a game at Hard Rock Stadium and it almost felt more like a social event than a football game.
Miami has some pretty good player on their roster though. That's something for their fans to get excited about.
Ryan Tannehill is a really good, underrated quarterback in the NFL I think.
Don't forget Ndamukong Suh on their defense. He's actually the highest paid player on the team.
Of the three NFL teams in the state of Florida, which do you think is going to have the best season in 2017?
I haven't been following those teams too closely but I would actually say that the Dolphins will do the best in 2017.
Really? You don't think Tampa Bay will have a good year?
Like I said, I haven't been following too closely but I think that Miami has the stronger roster and a slightly easier schedule.
Miami and Tampa Bay actually play each other in Week One of the season.
That might be an interesting game. I'll predict that Miami will win by a touchdown.
Do you think that the Dolphins have a chance to beat the Patriots when they play later in the season?
Absolutely not. Unless New England has a lot of injuries, I cannot see any way that Miami wins that game.
So what is a game on Miami's schedule that you think they have a chance to upset someone?
I'll predict that they have a good chance to win when they play at Atlanta.
That's a bold prediction that they'll defeat a team that went to the Super Bowl.
I just have have a good feeling about the match ups in the game.
