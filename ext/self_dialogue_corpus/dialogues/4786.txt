who is your favorite mlb team?
the st. louis cardinals
me too!
what do you think of them so far this year?
well they have a winning record, but it is still very early in the year
yes, they are 21-17
Hopefully they a good series coming up
Yes, I think they will.  They are playing the Giants
The Giants are only 17-25 this year
it would be nice if they could sweep
who is your favorite player
Yadi Molina is my favorite player for sure, he is the heart and sole of the team
Did you see him pick off that runner at third base the other night
Yes, indeed that was a great play
they have a lot of other talent as well
yes they sure do
I believe wacha is coming back to pitch in the next game
oh really, I have not heard that,  that is great news.
I sure hope he is well rested and ready to pitch
yes, they sure can use some good starting pitching
