What is your favorite scary movie?
I really like movies with zombies.
Which one is your favorite?
I think my favorite would be Night of the Living Dead.
The old one?
Yeah, the original George Romero movie.
Oh.  Do you like any newer movies?
Have you ever seen "My Boyfriend's Back?"
What is that about?
It's another zombie movie.
Is it old too?
Well, I think it was the late 80s.
Oh, I've never seen that one.
Oh, it's pretty funny.
I thought you said it was a zombie movie?
Yeah, but it's hilarious.
Is it scary at all?
Not really.  It's kind of a zombie movie spoof.
I guess I'm going to have to check it out.
Yeah, you really should.
