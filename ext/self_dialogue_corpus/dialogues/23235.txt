I seen this movie last night in the handy thinking about you
Oh yeah what movie did you go see
No I didn't see it at the theater that's all at home
Netflix and chill
Yeah it was a pretty good movie I actually want to watch it again
You just saw that why would you want to see it again
Because I really only got to see the beginning half the other half we kind of got interrupted
Hey I want to see it with you
I'd even tell you what the movie is called yet
I really don't care what's it called what's the type of movie
It's more of a like a drama-comedy type movie
I really don't like drama but since his comedy in there I'll check it out
Alright sounds good how about you come over tonight around 9
That works for me you want me to bring one in the movies I like
Nah that's okay I have plenty movies over here if we get bored
Whatever type of movies do you have
Mostly comedy and action
Oh cool so what's the name of the movie anyway
The name of the movie Just Called Home
Well can't wait to see it
