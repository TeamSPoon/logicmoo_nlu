I watched Jaws again the other night.
Where did you catch it?
There was a revival house downtown.  It's such a great movie to see in the theater, you know!
Absolutely!  What's your favorite John carpenter movie?
Hmm, that's a hard one.  I love Escape From New York, but I'd have to say Halloween, hands down.
I never saw Escape From New York.  Who's in that?
Kurt Russell, Adrienne Barbeau, Donald Pleasance.
Isn't that the film about New York becoming a maximum security prison?
That's the one!  Carpenter is a master!
I love Tarantino.  I think he's an old school director.  Every one of his movies are amazing.  My favorite is Death Proof
I love Inglourious Basterds with Brad Pitt.  Great movie!
Yeah, that was amazing!
Did you see the trailer for Star Wars: The Last Jedi yet?
No, how does it look?
Mark Hamill looks like he's going to have a much bigger part than the last one.
The Force Awakens?
Yeah, that's the one.  He was hardly in that, but what a build up!
What do you think of the Marvel Superhero films?
I love The Captain America films.  I missed a few of the others.
Check out Guardians of The Galaxy.  The 2nd one is out right now!
