Hi, How are you doing today?
Good, I'm glad to see you.  It's been a while.
Have you listened to any good music lately?
I have actually. I have been listening to new pop music recently.
So have I.  I like that type of music because it always puts me in a good mood.
I think it is great how different music can put you into different moods.
It really can. I have even heard of music therapy.
Yes, music can really help people.
I saw a video on facebook where they were helping a man walk with music.
How so?
They used the beat of the music to guide his feet with walking.
That is wonderful.
I know that when I need to relax, soothing music can really help with that.
I like to listen to slow music when I want to fall asleep.
When I clean, I like to listen to dance music to help me want to move.
When I am sad, I listen to sad rock music.
Its nice to hear that you feel the same way I do about music and moods.
I'm so happy I got to have this conversation with you today.
Talk to you later!
Bye!
