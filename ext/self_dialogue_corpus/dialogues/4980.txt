Did you see Derek Jeter night last night?
Yea, it was a nice service.
I think that Bryce Harper will win MVP this year.
Me too, he is playing really well.
I think Judge on the Yankees will win rookie of the year.
Me too, he is playing lights out.
I think that Pete Rose should be in the Hall of the Fame.
Me too, he is the hit king.
I think that Barry Bonds is the best outfielder of all time.
He was good, but he was a cheater.
I think that the Cubs are overrated this year.
I disagree, they won the world series last year.
The Yankees look really good this year.
Yea, they could do well this year.
I hope that the Blue jays improve.
I think they will, they have a good roster.
I think that the Red Sox are overachieving.
I disagree, they have a good team.
I think that the all-star game is waste of time.
I agree, it is boring and not that good.
