Maleficent was such an amazing story
it really was, the costumes were amazing
I liked how she called the baby Beastly
and how she cursed her but took care of her because the fairies could not
I know she gave her food in the leaf that was sweet
and she always watched over her as she grew up
I liked it when the girl discovered her
I hated when Maleifcent's wings were cut off
that scene was so scary and traumatic for her I bet
I am glad she got them back though, very moving story
