Did you see Hacksaw Ridge?
No, but I want to.
Yeah, me too. I heard it was really good.
I also heard it was really violent.
Oh really? Like Saving Private Ryan violent.
Oh wow, that movie was really violent.
Yeah, this one takes it up a notch.
Who directed it?
Mel Gibson
Oh, then that makes sense. Some of his other movies are pretty grisly.
Oh really, like which ones?
There was one called Apocalypto that was really violent
What's that one about?
It's about ancient America, Aztecs and whatnot
Oh so there's a lot of war like violence?
Yeah, beheadings and whatnot.
Hmmm, not sure if I'd like that one.
Overall it was pretty good. Seemed very realistic.
Yeah, that's probably what he was going for.
Yes, authenticity.
