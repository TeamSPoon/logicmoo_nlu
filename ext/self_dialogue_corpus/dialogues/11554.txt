Have you ever heard any of the Beatles music?
Yes I own several of their records.  I got them from my mom who was an avid fan.
That's so cool.  What is your favorite record?
I really like the Sgt. Pepper album.
Me too it is on of their best.  It is amazing how they influenced music.
I know right? Just 4 guys from England who liked to jam out.
It is a shame that they had a riff and split.
Yes, but they all did go on and make some good solo music.
They sure did.  Sir Paul and Ringo are still going strong.
I hope to see Paul if he goes out on tour and comes through my area.
