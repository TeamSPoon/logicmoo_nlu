What did you think of The Jungle Book?
It was quite good. I'm surprised how old it is actually.
Oh, what year was it from?
1967. My parents were still kids when it came out.
It holds up well. Great characters.
Baloo was always my favourite.
And Sher Khan was genuinely scary.
As any Bengal Tiger ought to be!
It was originally a Kipling novel wasn't it?
Yep. But Disney did it best.
