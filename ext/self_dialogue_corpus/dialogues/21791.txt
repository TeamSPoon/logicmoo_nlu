What do you think of Sandra Bullock.
I absolutely love her. She's probably one of my favorite actresses.
She has been in so many movies! When did she start acting?
I think her first movie was in 1987.
Wow, that's before I was born.
Me too. I think the earliest I've seen of hers is When You Were Sleeping.
That is such a classic! I really liked her comedies.
Yes, Miss Congeniality was hilarious.
So was The Heat.
Oh I forgot about that one. She was a cop right?
Yes, with Melissa McCarthy.
She's another hysterical actress.
I know. Was her first movie Bridesmaids?
Actually no. She's been acting a lot longer than that. Her first full length movies was back in 1999.
I had no idea!
Yes, and she was in Charlie's Angels too.
As who?
Sandra.
I don't remember her. Then again it's been years since I've seen it.
Me too.
