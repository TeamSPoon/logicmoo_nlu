What was the last movie you saw in theaters?
The Princess and the Frog.
I love that movie. Oh man that really took me back to being a little girl.
Me too! There were like 20 of us moms there and we all felt like 7 year old girls wanting to be princesses.
Oh me too. Tiana was so pretty!
Yea and she could bake too. Those Beignets look amazing.
Oh I just wanted to lick the screen.
Oh me too. I loved Ray in the film.
Oh the firefly. He was so cute.
Yea him being in love with that star was adorable.
