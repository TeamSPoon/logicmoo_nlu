What is your favorite Star Wars Movie?
I think episode 5 is the best.
Really? I think episode 3 is the best.
Well, 3 is good but I don't like the older movies because of the visual effects.
Well sure the effects aren't as good but the plot is way better.
Well in Episode 5 the plot and the effects are good.
That's true, plus Luke makes a better protagonist than Anniken
Exactly! Aniken kind of sucked as a protagonist. He's a better villian.
Darth Vader is pretty cool. It's a shame he actually dies in the sixth episode.
Yeah, maybe he'll make a comback for revenge.
