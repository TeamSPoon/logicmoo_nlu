I was watching a children's show a couple days ago with my cousins. There was a parody of the Sgt. Pepper's Band.
Did they have the band uniforms on?
They did. Four of the characters had on the right color uniforms.
That sounds awesome. The Sgt. Pepper album is one of my favorites.
Mine too! Not only is the music great, but the art is fantastic as well.
I love the concept behind it. What's your favorite track on the album?
I love "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds"; but I also love "When I'm Sixty-Four", "Lovely Rita", and "Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite", too. It's too hard to pick.
"With a Little Help from my Friends", is my favorite. All the songs on the album are great, though.
It's hard to think that the album recently celebrated it's fiftieth anniversary.
It really is. Fifty years later and the music is still great.
