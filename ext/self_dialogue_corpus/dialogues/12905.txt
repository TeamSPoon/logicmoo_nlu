What was that place in the Star Wars movie with fun music and drinks?
You mean The Cantina?
Yeah. What episode was that in?
I believe it was Episode IV: A New Hope
I wouldn't mind going to a place like that.
I think they actually built a bar inspired by the Cantina somewhere in Hollywood
Really? We should check it out.
Perhaps. Was that your favorite movie?
I don't really have a favorite. How about you?
I like the last episode the best.
