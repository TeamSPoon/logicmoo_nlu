So, did you hear what Brady's wife said a few weeks back?
About the concussions?
Yeah. She said like he comes home with them or something like that.
Yeah, there was a story on NFL.com about it i think.
It seems that no one asked him directly about it.
And it seemed like either Billachek or the Patriots tried to cover it up.
I think they were moe like trying to sweep it under the rug like it never happened.
Well, he looks fine.
True and he seems coherent.
I guess it's really up to Brady to deal with this problem.
I thought there was a commission that looked into concussions.
I think there is.
Wonder what they think about this.
It's tricky. the NFL is a multi-billion dollar industry.
True but if you have no players.....
There will always be players.
Yes, but not good ones if you got to get new ones year after year.
Again, it really is Brady's problem. He knows when he is hit or not.
I agree, but he may just want to push thru the pain.
I dunno. It's a unique world in the NFL.
