Disney should make a new princess movie.
Totally! I love princess movies.
I wish they'd do the Princess and the Pea.
What about the Twelve Dancing Princesses?
I dunno. That's too complicated.
Yeah, but I bet Disney could do it.
I think they should remake the Little Mermaid as a live action movie.
They're doing a lot of remakes these days.
I know, because everyone loves them.
True. Anything princess is gonna sell.
