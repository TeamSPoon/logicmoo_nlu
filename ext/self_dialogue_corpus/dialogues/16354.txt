You wanna hit the club tonight?
Not really in the mood for clubin'.
Why not?
That dreadful music.
What else you gonna dance to?
I'd take a little Country Swing before that.
Now that's a pretty picture.
Hey, I can dance to just about anything.
So come out with us.
Gotta pass. I've had enough techno to last a life time.
I hear they have a new DJ.
Yeah, but the new one will play the same stuff I'll bet.
Yeah, same owner same club.
Give me some of that old time Rock 'n Roll!
Settle down there, Mr. Seger.
Ha! Well that song fits me to a tee.
I know, I know, ya old dog.
That's just hurtful.
Just messin with you. We'll miss you tonight.
Hope you have a good time.
