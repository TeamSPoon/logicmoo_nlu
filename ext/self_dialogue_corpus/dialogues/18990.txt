What do you think of artists that commit suicide?
I think it is sad and quite scary.
It makes you wonder what is so bad that they choose that.
Maybe the music industry is too much to deal with at times.
This is true, we never know what they are going through.
Some artists get mixed up with drugs and alcohol.
That makes sense, they have the money and the means to do it.
Just look at Micheal Jackson!
Good example, wasn't that a overdose on pills?
Yes I believe so.
Such a waste of a talent. He was amazing.
I remember when they announced his passing.
Me too, a lot of older friends had cried over his passing.
It was a huge loss to the music industry, but I do not think he committed suicide.
Chris Cordell just took his life.
He was the lead singer of Audioslave right?
Yes and also Soundgarden.
I loved their music.
As did I, I grew up listening to it.
He had such a unique voice too.
