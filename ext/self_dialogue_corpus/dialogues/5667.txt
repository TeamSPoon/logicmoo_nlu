Hey my daughter is having a play this weekend about "The Little Mermaid" do you want to go?
Yes absolutely, what part does she play?
Well she tried out for Ariel but someone else got the part
That sucks!
Yeah but she ended up getting a couple parts, her first part is the Mental Chef
Totally fitting for her
Yes and her second part is a manta ray
So kind of a cameo part
Yeah its a non speaking part
Still she will do very well in it
