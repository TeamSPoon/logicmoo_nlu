Guess who I saw in concert last night?
Who, I hope it was one of the greats.
Yes Tom Petty!
Wow, how was it?
It was great, the tickets were a bit pricey but definitely worth it!
What songs did he sing?
A lot of the classics and some new ones Free Falling, Running down a dream, and American Girl to name a few
Sounds great! Did he do any songs off the Wildflower album?
Yes actually, he did Wildflowers
That was one of my favorite Tom Petty Albums
Mine as well It did not seem to get as much recognition as some of the others but it is excellent
Another good one was Full Moon Fever, that one is AWESOME
Yea that was one of his early ones, American Girl, Full Moon Fever and other great songs
I think it came out in 1979. Boy I was sure young then..
Me Too. His latest is Hypnotic Eye. That one came out a few years ago.
I know that one has some good songs on it as well.
Maybe we can go see him together next time he comes around.
That would be great.
Do you remember the Traveling Wilburys?
Sure Tom Petty was in that too, as well as George Harrison and Roy Orbison.
