Do you remember the part in The Little Mermaid when Sebastian is stuck in the kitchen with the French chef?
Yeah, why?
That's my favorite part!
Haha!  Why?
I took French in high school, so when the French chef is saying things to him, I know what he is saying.
Really?  I never thought about it.  Like what?
Like he says "zut" which is French for "darn!"
Cool.
And the song "Les poissons" means "the fish".
Oh I get it now!  "Les poissons les poissons, how I love les poissons".
