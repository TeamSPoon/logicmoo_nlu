Did you like the middle three Star Wars films that I guess you would call the first three.
You mean episodes 1-3, the prequels?
Yeah man, little orphan Annie and all that.
The first one stunk, but Clone Wars and Revenge of the Sith were decent.
Yeah, those two were alright but just too much computer animation in all of them.
I agree, they didn't look anything like the original films.
I do though think Abrams did a good job getting back to the original look and feel of the brand with Awakens.
Me too, but he's not directing The Last Jedi, Rian Johnson is.
Yeah I know, but I like that dude, he's done some cool films and I think it will end up looking like Empire.
Man I hope so, Empire is still my favorite out of all of them.
