Have you heard of Ariana Grande?
Who is that?
A musician.
Maybe I know some of her music, name a couple songs.
how about side to side?
Never heard of it, another?
Bang Bang?
I like that song, didn't know the artist so it's cool to finally find out.
I'm a fan of hers plus shes cute.
She is?
Yep, how about One last time?
Heard that one too.
She has some good songs and some mediocre ones.
I don't know how I never knew her name.
She kind of flies under the radar most of the time.
Guess that's why then.
Want another song.
Yes please.
Love me harder.
I love that song.
