Who do you think the greatest QB in NFL history is?
Hands down - Peyton Manning!
Why Peyton?
He owns all the major passing records and he holds the single season TD record.
I'm going to disagree with you on that one, He only won two Super Bowls.
Yeah, that is low compared to others, but you have to look at all the records.
The records are nice, but winning is why they play the games.
Ok, who do you think? Bradshaw, Montana, Staubach?
Come on man! You didn't even mention Tom Brady!
Alright, as far as winning he would be the best.  But he always had great teams because of Belichek.
Your forgetting that Brady won his Super Bowls in the era of free agency.
True, most of the other quarterbacks never had to deal with constant turn over of players.
I think that's what makes Brady so great, he does it every year with different players.
Yeah, I agree.
The greatest pure passer was Marino though.
Yeah, he was awesome to watch.
Imagine the numbers he would have put up in today's game.
True, the rules favor the quarterback today more than in the 80's.
If Marino played today, he may have set records that would never have been touched by anyone.
Yeah, he threw a great ball.  Too bad they couldn't get some players for him.
