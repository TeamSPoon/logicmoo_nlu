Have you heard DJ Khaled's new album?
No, I haven't. What's the album called?
It's called Grateful. It has some awesome songs.
Which song is your favorite?
My favorite is I'm The One. It features Justin Bieber, Quavo, Chance The Rapper, and Lil Wayne.
That sounds cool. I really like Chance The Rapper, but I'm not a fan of Justin Bieber.
Why don't you like Justin Bieber?
I don't think his voice sounds good. Also, I usually only listen to rap, not pop music.
Is Chance your favorite rapper?
Jay-Z is my favorite rapper, but I do really like Chance's last album, Coloring Book.
Me too! I really like the first song on the album, All We Got, because of the choir in the background.
That is a really cool song, but I like All Night better.
That's also a great song. Every time I hear All Night, I want to stand up and dance.
I feel the same way. Whenever my friends and I go out dancing, we ask the DJ to play it.
Who is the other artist who is featured on that song?
It's Knox Fortune. He's not as famous as some of the other artists featured on the album, but he's good.
I've never heard his name apart from this one song. Do you know any other songs that he's made?
There's a song called Help Myself that came out this year.
What genre of music is it?
I would call it indie-pop, but it sounds similar to The Beatles.
