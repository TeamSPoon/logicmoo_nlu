Do you remember seeing A League of Their Own?
I loved that movie!
It really was great, wasn't it?
It was based on a real league, too.
I liked Tom Hanks in that movie.
Yeah, it was funny to see him as such a jerk.
There were a lot of big names in that film.
Yeah, Madonna, Rosie O'Donnell.  There were more too.
The red head that was in there.  What was her name?
Oh, that was Geena Davis.
