Did you ever see The Hunchback of Notre Dame?
Yes. I am a big fan of it too.
I saw it in theaters. It is a good Disney movie.
Do you think it's as good as the greats like Aladdin.
It's not as good as Aladdin, but it is good.
The animated films got a little worse after The Lion King.
I agree. I did not like Pocahontas that much.
Did you like Mulan?
Not really. I did not like Tarzan either.
Yeah, the classics like Lion King and Aladdin and The Little Mermaid are the best.
