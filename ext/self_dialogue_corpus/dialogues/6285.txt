They need to remaster One Hundred and One Dalmatians.
No they don't. It's a classic.
I know, but the animation is so dated.
Didn't it release in the '60s? There are older more dated Disney films than that.
You mean like Alice in Wonderland?
Sure, Alice in Wonderland. Also Bambi, Snow White and the Seven Dwarves, Cinderella, and Pinocchio.
You're right. They should remake them all.
Why would you want to remake all those classics?
I don't really enjoy the dated animations. I just want them to look more modern.
To each their own, I guess. But you're wrong.
