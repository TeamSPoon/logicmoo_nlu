What is your take on the whole revamp of movies?
The sort of not exactly sequels you mean?
Yeah. Like the new Jurassic Park films.
I am on the fence, what do you think?
I think there are too many, but I like some of them.
I like the new Jurasic park. It does not pretend the old films did not happen.
Like a sort of continuation. But not exactly
Yes. Maybe like the new Han Solo film.
That looks like it will be dumb.
Never the less, people will go see it.
I like when the remakes pay homage to the old one.
Like Days of Future Past?
Kind of, but then they just erased the whole plot of the old ones.
But it did move the story on .
Some of these not really sequels are just too much. Did you see the remake of Dirty Dancing?
It was actual garbage. Not even fit to watch.
I wonder why they remake so many movies like that.
I do not know. It was worse than the last remake of that film
There was a last one?
Yes, Dirty Dancing, Havana Nights. Not great.
