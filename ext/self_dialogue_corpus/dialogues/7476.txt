I just read something interesting about Harrison Ford and getting the part of Han Solo.
What's that?
He never auditioned for the part.
Then how did he get it?
He was helping other actors run their lines when George Lucas was casting and after awhile, Lucas realized that Ford was perfect for the part.
How lucky is that?
And do you know how much he got paid for A New Hope?
I have no idea.
Only $10,000.
That's nothing!
