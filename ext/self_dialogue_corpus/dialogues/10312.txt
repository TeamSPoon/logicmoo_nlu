I loved that movie, Die Hard.
The Bruce Willis flick from the 80's.
The first one was the best one but I didn't enjoy the sequels nearly as much.
The first one was very original and had a great cast.
Who played the villian in that one? I can't remember.
It was Alan Rickman.
That's right. He is a great actor.
I agree.
I wonder if there really is a Nakatomi building in LA?
I don't think so, but if there is, it sure took a beating from the filming of all those action scenes.
