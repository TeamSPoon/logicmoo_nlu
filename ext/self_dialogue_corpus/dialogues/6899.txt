Have you sen the new Cars movie yet?
No I haven't, but I can't wait to see it!
It looks really good, Lightening McQueen has a new rival.
Do you think they're going to have more of Mater in it?
I think I saw Mater in the preview.
My kids think Mater is the best part of the movies.
Mater is funny, but I don't think he was that special.
Well, obviously a lot of people liked Mater because Cars 2 was mostly just about him!
That's true. The new one is supposed to be about Lightening McQueen and a new character named Cruz.
Is Cruz supposed to be his new rival?
