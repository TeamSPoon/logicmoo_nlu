Have you seen Captain America: Civil War?
Yes I have.
I thought it was the best Marvel movie yet.
I agree. I especially liked how Spider-man is now portrayed.
The actor was great. I loved his interactions with Iron Man and the others during the big battle in the middle of the movie.
That was a great scene. Spider-man and Ant Man added a lot of humor.
Some of the superfluous stuff was boring though, like the scenes with Scarlet Witch and Vision.
I agree.
I know they needed something slow between the big action pieces, but it just felt unnecessary.
I agree with that. But it's still a great movie.
Yes it is.
The Spider-man was definitely better than the Garfield or Macguire portrayals.
I liked the first two Macquire movies and the first Garfield one, but the others were pretty bad.
Garfield was a good Spider-man but a poor Peter Parker.
Yes, he looks like he's 40 years old. Parker is supposed to be in high school.
Spider-man 3 had to be the worst, though.
Too many villains, too much indulgent garbage.
I'm glad Sony came to an agreement with Marvel for the character.
Agreed, now we can finally see Spider-man done right.
The upcoming movie does look a lot better than what we've seen in the past.
