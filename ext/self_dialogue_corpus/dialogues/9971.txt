What was your favorite Bond movie?
Old or new?  There's been so many.
I would just say ones that have been made recently, like the last 15 years or so.
So out of the Daniel Craig movies?  Skyfall.
See, I always thought that was a bit overrated.  I prefer Casino Royale.
Well, that was the first one with him I think.  They worked the kinks out in that movie.
I actually thought the plot was better than Skyfall.
We'll have to agree to disagree on that one.
One thing's for sure: Quantam of Solace was garbage.
Oh yeah.  Not a good film.
