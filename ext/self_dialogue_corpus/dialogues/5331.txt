Have you seen the live action remake of Beauty and the Beast?
No, I didn't get a chance to see it in the theater.
You should definitely rent or buy the DVD. It was amazing!
Did they use any of the original music? I love the music in that movie!
Yes, they did! My favorite remake was the theme song, "Beauty and the Beast."
I'm not sure anyone could do it as well as Angela Lansbury did.
She was amazing in the original, that's for sure. But this version was really good.
What was your favorite thing about the remake?
The costumes were completely amazing! You really have to see it to appreciate it.
I will definitely rent it, maybe even buy it. Thanks for the recommendation.
