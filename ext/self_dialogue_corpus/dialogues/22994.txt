You know what movie I love?  300.
Yes, that movie has made me want to learn all about Spartans.
I know what you mean.  It's crazy how they fought those odds.
Yeah, and fought long enough to repel the attack.
Yep, even though they all died.
Yeah.  That's what makes it so awesome though.
And the Spartans were crazy good warriors.
Yeah I wouldn't want to fight them either.
One of my favorite parts is when Leonidis fakes to kneel and cuts Xerksies.
I love it.  And the guy telling the story at the end.
You know what was not good though?  The sequel.
Yeah, I didn't care much for it.
Until the Spartans came at the end of course.
Of course.  Those guys are beast.
Yeah don't want to be on their bad side.
I liked the Spartan training in the first one.
Yeah, they make them weapons from day one.
Yes, and everyone is super fit.
I've heard that Sparta was a lot like that.
I've heard that too.
