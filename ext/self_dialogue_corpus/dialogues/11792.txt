A lot of people think Ringo Star was a bad drummer
Over time, that has been proven to be wrong.
How do you know that?
First of all,  before Ringo, drummers were measured by the drumming solo.  Ringo didn't do that.
He always was just in the background
Not really.  What Ringo did was drum as an integral part of the song.  Like in the song, from the album Help, people said that they knew what song was going to be played just by a few measures of his drums.
So he changed the role of the drummer by becoming one with the band
Except in the cases of the huge stadium concerts.  The screaming was so loud he could hear what the rest of the guys were singing
So what did he do?
He kept the beat going by watching how the other guys were wiggling their butts.
