what do you do for fun?
i like to drink and listen to country music.
doesnt that make you sad?
sometimes it does.
everytime i listen to country music while drinking, i cry.
yeah, that happens to me sometimes too.
whats the best way to avoid such an embarassing experience?
well, if you cant give up drinking and dont like other music... i suggest you just do it all when you are alone.
thats no fun to drink alone.
sometimes its best to just let it all out.
i guess you could be right.
i know im right.
i do always feel better after a good crying session.
if you dont have anything going on bad in your life, you probably wont cry.
sometimes i feel fine but after drinking and listening to country, ill think of past things that make me sad.
if you cry about it, chances are you wont cry about it again.
i guess youre right.
let them tears fall and move on with your life.
i like that.
its words to live by.
