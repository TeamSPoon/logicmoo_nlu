Have you heard the Blake Shelton song Neon Light?
Oh yeah, that's a great song!  I love his music so much.
Yeah, he's a spectacular artist.  I really think he's my favorite country singer of all time.
Wow, that's saying a lot!  I know you love country music.
Yeah, and I sure love his music.  Doin' What She Likes is also an amazing song.
I love that video!  It's so funny.
Yeah, he has the most romantic songs.  I love all his videos.
When did his first album come out?
Oh it was Austin in 2001.  That was his first single too.
I haven't even heard that one I don't think.
Yeah, that's a little known piece of trivia.  He's been around longer than you'd think.
He's gone platinum hasn't he?
Oh definitely, he went platinum long ago.  His music is incredible.
Yeah it really is.  Isn't he a judge on The Voice, too?
Yep, he definitely is!
He released If I'm Honest in 2016, was that his latest album?
I think so.  That's the one with Came Here to Forget, right?
Yeah, that song is on there.
I think so.  The latest I've heard is that Guy With a Girl song.
I'm not too wild about that one.
