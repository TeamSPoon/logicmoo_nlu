Do you think Eli Manning is better then his brother?
It is hard to make that decision.
I know, we need to see how the rest of his career plays out.
If he wins one more superbowl it is almost definitely Eli who is better.
It is crazy he already has two at this point in his career.
You can't leave out that both his Superbowl wins are against the Patriots.
Exactly Brady will always regret those games.
He could have seven rings at this point instead of five.
Brady is still a great player.
Yeah but having seven rings he could be better then Michael Jordan.
Do you think you can really compare Football to Basketball?
I guess you are right.
I know I am right!
Don't forget you actually have to win more games to win an NBA Championship.
More games means more chances to win.
That is a good point.
The NFL playoffs are single elimination so it is much harder to win a Superbowl.
That can be debated as winning 16 games is harder then winning 3-4 games.
We can continue this argument another time.
Sounds good to me!
