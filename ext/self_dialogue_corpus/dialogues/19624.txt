Do you listen to Malinda Kathleen Reece?
Not that I know of, who is that?
Have you heard of the google translate series?
No, what is it?
There was a viral video a few years ago where she translated "Let It Go" from Frozen in like 10 languages, then sung the translation.
And?
It was a mess, and really funny.
I think I saw that video.
Well, Malinda Kathleen Reece is the person behind the channel.
She goes by her full name?
Yeah, that's not unusual.
Yes, it is. It's really, really weird.
Anyway, she has her own YouTube channel.
Is it all just Google Translate over and over and over and over and
Yes, okay, I get it. But yeah, each one is pretty good.
How's that get funded? Seems like shooting videos independently is expensive.
She has patrons, and I don't think YouTube employs her.
She has patrons?
Yeah, people give her donations to make her music videos.
That sounds awfully like a mistress, honestly. But she sounds like a great kid.
