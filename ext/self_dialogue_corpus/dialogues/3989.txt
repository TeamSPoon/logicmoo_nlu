Have you seen 13 sins?
No I've never heard of it.
Oh, its my favorite thriller!
yeah?
its a remake of a korean film called 13 beloved
oh I think ive heard of that one.
Have you seen Nerve?
yeah.
okay so its really similar in story, but nerve is the watered down baby version of 13 sins. Its crazy and brutal
I liked nerve, so I'll check it out!
