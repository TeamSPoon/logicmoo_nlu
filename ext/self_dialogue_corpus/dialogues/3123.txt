Hi!  NFL football is about to begin again, I can't wait.
Me either! Who's your favorite team?
I love the Falcons.
Even after last years Super Bowl?
Yep, this is Matt Ryan's year!
Well I'm sticking with the Patriots.
You would! I like the Lions too.
Why? They aren't that good.
Yes, but I like Matt Stafford.
Oh yeah, he was UGA's quarterback.
Yep! Are you going to any games?
I hope so, I want to tailgate.
Me too!
I got tickets to the new Atlanta Mercedes Benz stadium.
Cool! I want to go with you!
Ok, you can come when they play the Saints
Wow, that will be a crazy game!
I know, they are the Falcons biggest rivals.
I can't wait for NFL football!
Only a couple more months!
