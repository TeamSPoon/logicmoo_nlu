Do you think the Browns will be improved this season?
I mean... they loaded up on draft picks. They should be better.
You would THINK they would be.
Yeah, it's hard to be confident in them though.
They always seem to do poorly every season.
It's because their old management staff kept messing things up.
Yeah, it'll be interesting to see how their new staff does.
We shall see. They can't do any worse than the old regime.
Only way they would be worse is if they went winless this coming season.
That's hard to do.
Yeah. I feel bad for the Chargers losing to them last season.
Suprise of the season.
Chargers also need a reboot.
That team is literally up and down every season.
Philip Rivers is a gun slinger.
He reminds me of Brett Favre.
Yeah, he chucks the ball.
He makes a lot of mistakes too. I like his hustle though.
You can't teach that.
That's for sure.
