Have you ever seen any movies adapted from Jane Austen books?
Yes, I have seen several.
They are some of my favorite movies.  I really like Sense and Sensibility, starring Emma Thompson.
Yes, that is a really good movie.
Emma Thompson wrote the screen adaptation, and she won an Oscar for it.
I really enjoyed watching her play Elinor.  Kate Winslet was good too.
I think playing Marianne Dashwood was one of Kate Winslet's first major roles.  She did an excellent job.
I wasn't a big fan of Hugh Grant as Edward, but Alan Rickman made an excellent Colonel Brandon.
Yes, I think Edward was a bit miscast.  But Alan Rickman was and excellent choice, and he and Kate Winslet played off of each other very well.
Did you know that the actor who played John Willoughby is actually married to Emma Thompson?
No, I didn't know that.
Yes, they met on set.  He first briefly dated Kate Winslet, but then eventually ended up marrying Emma Thompson, and they are still married today.
That is fascinating.  His character was such a jerk.
Yes, the way Willoughby treated Marianne was horrible.  He broke her heart.
Yes, but Colonel Brandon was there to put it back together.  I really liked the end scene where Brandon and Marianne get married.
That was a beautiful scene.  If you look closely, I think Edward and Elinor get married too; they walk out behind Brandon and Marianne.
Oh yes.  I think I saw that.
I also really love the scene where Brandon finds Marianne in the rain and carries her home.
Yes, that is one of the most dramatic parts of the movie.
You aren't sure if she will survive her illness, but she does and then goes on to marry Brandon.  It was so romantic.
