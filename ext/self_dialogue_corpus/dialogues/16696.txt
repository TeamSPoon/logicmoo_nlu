I'm trying to make a workout playlist. Can you help me add some songs?
Sure. Eye of the Tiger has to be number one.
Oh yeah good xall. What else you got?
I really like X Ambassadors The Jungle. It gets me pumped.
Ok I will add that. I heard it when Cub Swanson walked out for his UFC fight.
Yeah! Also, some music from Otherwise is always good.
I'm not too familiar. What song should I add.
Die For You is good.
OK, thanks. I just added Get the funk out by Extreme.
Good choice. How about some Buckcherry?
Yeah I like Anything, Anything from them.
That's a good one. From the movie Road Trip, right?
Yes! I also think I should add some Foo Fighters.
Definitely. Walk, Something From Nothing, and Best of You are must haves.
Thanks. I am putting Thunderstruck on their now.
That is the ultimate getting pumped song.
I agree. Anything else?
How about some Youth Gone Wild?
Skid Row, how could I forget them?
Yeah and maybe Here I Go Again by Whitesnake.
