Allirght, name you top three favorite bands, regardless of genre.
Well, my first pick would be Black Veil Brides.
Good, a little gothic, but more glam rock. Now, your number two pick?
Well, that would have to be Bon Jovi, been a big fan for years now.
Nice, Jon been around since big hair rock in the 80s, and he still keeps going.
Yes, he does. Now, my third pick would be Transsiberian Orchestra.
Transsiberian Orchestra, I've heard the name, but not the band. What are they like?
They do symphonic rock, mxing clasical music and instrumentation with rock and roll.
Okay, come to think of it didn't they do that rocked up version of the Carol of the Bells?
Yes, but now it's your turn what are your 3 top picks for bands.
Well, my first pick would be Sabaton, I like their style and subject matter.
Okay, I can see that. What's your second pick?
Well, my second would be Avatar, I love their song Vultures Fly.
Okay, they aren't too band, but who about something that isn't a Swedish heavy metal band?
Okay, for my third pick I'd go with Motorhead.
Still heavy metal, but not Swedish. So what's your favorite Motorhead song?
Ace of Spades, I'd have to say.
Me, I prefer Hail to the King.
Yeah it's good, but old Lemmy's great in virtually any of his songs.
True, true. Pity about him dying, rest in peace Lemmy.
