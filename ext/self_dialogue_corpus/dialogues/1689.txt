Did you ever watch Super Bowl VI?
No way, I'm way too young
But did you ever catch it on an old NFL Films tape
No, who played in it?
The Cowboys and Dolphins
Who won that one?
The Cowboys, big time.
Was that the start of the Cowboys' dominance?
Somewhat, it was their first bowl win.
Who was their coach back then?
Tom Landry
Oh yeah, I've heard things about him. Mostly good.
Yeah, he always wore a suit and hat on the sidelines.
Yeah, didn't he coach a long time?
Yes he did, but kind of had a bad ending.
That's too bad.
Yeah, Roger Staubach was the QB of the Boys back then.
Oh yeah, the Navy guy.
Yeah that's him
I heard he was a good playere.
