I am on a big power metal trip lately.
Oh really, like who?
I can't stop listening to Dragon Force lately.
I have heard of them but never really listened to them before.
They really get me going when I listen to them.
How is their music?
It is really fast paced electric guitar shredding. It is great.
I always love an electric guitar.
Then you would love them. Their songs are full of great guitar solos and sections.
What kind of songs are there?
Probably their most well known song is Through the Fire and Flames.
Oh yeah, I think I have heard of that.
It is one of my favorites. I could listen to it on loop.
I might look into them, any other songs you'd recomend?
Definitely check out Valley of the Damned and Fury of the Storm.
I am already feeling pumped.
The album Valley of the Damned is worth a look too.
Thanks, I'll look into that.
No problem, they have a decent many albums besides that too. It is hard to go wrong.
Alright, time to hop online and see if I can find a couple of them.
