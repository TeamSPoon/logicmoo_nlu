So, how do you feel about the world of sports these days?
I mainly just watch the NFL for the most part.
Do you have a particular team that you cheer for?
Yes, I am a huge Tampa Bay Buccaneers fan.
I thought you were! How have they been doing?
They had a pretty good year last year, finishing second in the NFC South.
Was that good enough to earn them a playoff birth?
No, but it was pretty good when you consider those nine wins were more than they had in the previous two seasons combined.
That is true. It is all a matter of perspective I guess.
My hope is that they can take it a step further this upcoming year and get in the playoffs.
They sure did not seem to give Lovie Smith much of a chance to be successful there.
Yea, he was fired rather quickly I thought. Although Dirk Koetter seems to have been a great replacement.
How do you feel about the quarterback position?
I think Jameis Winston is going to be a huge star!
You really think that he has what it takes?
Absolutely! I wanted him ever since the first time I watched him play at Florida State.
I saw him play against Auburn and win a national championship; he seemed to have star potential.
I think in a few years he will be considered among the best quarterbacks in the entire league.
Does he have any play makers around him?
Mike Evans is really good, and this year they signed DeSean Jackson as well.
