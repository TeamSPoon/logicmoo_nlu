What was the worst Star Wars movie, in your opinion?
I don't even need to think about that one.  It was 'Phantom Menace.'
What didn't you like about it.
Well, the most glaring thing was that there were way too many Senate meetings and boring dialogue.
You're right.  I remember even as a kid, those scenes made me want to fast forward.
Also, the dialogue was so badly written.  And the rules for the Jedi were poorly established.
Yea, the rules were always unclear to me.  For instance, why does romantic love lead to the dark side?
I have absolutely no idea.  Also, the age gap between Padm√© and Anakin was a bit disturbing to me.
You're right.  Even though they fixed it in the next movie, I'll always remember that child as Anakin.
They should have just began the prequel right from Anakin being trained as a young Jedi.  Without the backstory of Tatooine.
