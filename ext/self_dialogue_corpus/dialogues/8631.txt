Being a musician what rock era do you like the most?
Wow that's a hard one? If you want it from the adolescent me or the musician the answer may be different.
Tell me both. Adolescent first.
Growing up in the 90's I loved Kiss and glam rock. But Jimi Hendrix will always win out.
I can see that in you.
But as a musician I love metal and dissonance.
So who today is your favorite?
Steve Vai, Satriani and Jimi Hendrix. The best guitar players for my taste in music.
Yes those guys are all incredible
Don't get me wrong there are rock players like Carlos Santana and Clapton that are superb
