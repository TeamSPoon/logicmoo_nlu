So how stoked are you about the NFL fotbll this season?
Oh I am so ready!!!
Me too, I wish the season was longer!
Yeah now that would be great!
I am really looking forward to seeing what the 49er's are going to do this year.
You and your 49er's, come on Joe Montana has been gone for many years.
So you don't give up on your team just because the best quarterback ever retired!
Oh OK best ever right, WRONG!
Oh I forgot you are a Brady fan.
Look all the great players San Fransisco had are gone. Rice, Montana retired.
So what they still have a lot of great players and I know this is going to be their year.
Especially since they are getting a new starting QB
New talent is always a plus, it is about who plays well and who has the desire to win.
Your right, and with that I can say MY team is going all the way and you will be crying again.
Yeah Yeah I hear you trash talking, but the season hasn't started yet and you will see.
Ya I will see you crying when they do not make the play-offs.
Well we will see the Patriots do have a good team, but I think you are going to be surprised by a few teams, not just my guys.
You say that every year and every year my guys are Superbowl bound.
Well we will see, first game is at your house this year.
I know and I can't wait ti you see the new "sports room" with a new HUGE TV so we can see every play up close!
