Remember that Ashton Kutcher movie from 15 years ago or so?
Are you talking about The Butterfly Effect?
Right.  That was a pretty decent film I thought.
One of the better ones he's ever been in I guess.
Did you ever the see alternate ending?
Nope, didn't know there was one.
In the one they put in the director's cut, he actually kills himself in the womb.
What?  That sounds crazy.
It was actually a much better ending than the original, but guess they deemed it to extreme for audiences.
It actually sounds like a much more fitting ending.
