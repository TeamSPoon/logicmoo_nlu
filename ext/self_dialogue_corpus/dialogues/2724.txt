So it's that time of year again. FOOTBALL!!!!!!
I am ready. How about you?
You don't even have to ask. I called up the other guys. Everybody is coming over to my place this Saturday.
This is the year I win.
HAHAHA yeah right. You know in Fantasy football you don't have to be loyal to your favorite team.
The 49ers are doing it this year.
You are putting too much faith in Shanahan.
No I see a path with Shan and Hoyer.
Well there is always a chance.
All the pieces are there and this is the year they come together.
Like I said anything is possible. But in Fantasy football you should be playing the stats at least to some degree.
I am all in.
Yeah....and how has that worked out for you? I've won the two of the last four years and my favorite team is?
The Rams. Don't know why you like them.
It doesn't matter as far as fantasy football is concerned. And that is why I win and you don't.
But the NIners this year...
Your only chance with the Niners was 2012. Since then there hasn't been anybody on the team that I would pick.
Well that may be but I am a fan. And I will win or lose with them until the end.
HAHAHA that is fine with me. I don't mind taking your money. And you're okay to have around too.
Yeah yeah. I'll see you Saturday.
