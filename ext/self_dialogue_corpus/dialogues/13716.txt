Do you remember Bad Romance? That was such a great song.
Oh yeah, Lady Gaga! She's extremely talented with the piano, I love Poker Face.
Did you know she learned to play the piano when she was four?
No way... But then I can believe it, she's seriously an amazing artist.
Yeah but you know a lot of people judge her for her fashion choices.
Like when she wore that dress made of meat? I have to admit, that was a bit weird.
Artists sometimes do things that a lot of normal people wouldn't. That's just how show business works.
I think it has more to do with her personality, but I guess you're right.
Either way, I think we can agree that Lady Gaga has made some excellent music.
Too true. I really hope that she comes out with another song like Perfect Illusion soon.
