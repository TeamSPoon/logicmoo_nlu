I just saw Revenge of the Sith.
I saw it only once.
I think Padmé Amidala was once again, hot.
Agreed.  What else did you like?
I liked when Anakin killed the kids.
Very disturbing,  Hard to think of him as a hero thereafter.
I liked how Obi-wan cut Anakin up, though.
Yes, that was gruesome.
The saddest part was when Padmé Amidala died.
I loved the funeral scene.
