Who was your favorite Disney character as a kid?
I never really liked the human characters as a kid, so I think it must have been Simba.
Really? Mine was Aladdin.
That is a real rags to riches story.
What about any that aren't the protagonist.
Hmm. Cruella DeVille was a really good villain.
Yeah. But so was Jafar.
It sounds like you just really like Aladdin!
I guess I do!
We can watch it later, if you want.
