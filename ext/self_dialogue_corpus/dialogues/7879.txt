What's your favorite Harry Potter movie?
I really like The Deathly Hallows, part one. Although the ending is so sad.
I agree. I cry every time I watch it when Dobby says, "Dobby is happy to be with his friends."
It was crazy to me that Bellatrix threw the knife into their Apparation just at that last minute.
I know. And Harry was so sad when he was trying to find something in Hermione's purse to save Dobby with.
Which Harry Potter movie is your favorite?
I loved the Chamber of Secrets.
Really? I think that's one of the worst ones! The change in direction was not a good move.
I just liked that we're introduced to horcruxes for the first time, even if we don't know exactly what their purpose is yet.
That's true. Plus, we get to learn more about Ginny, even though she's one of my least favorite characters.
