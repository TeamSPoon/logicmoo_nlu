hey! its comparison Wednesday!
what does that mean?
its the day we compare two artists
i don't remember anything about this
we did this last Wednesday, ah never mind, who do you think is a better artist between 2-Pac and Drake
you did not just compare those two
yeah i just did, i need your opinion
you wanna know what my opinion is?
yes man bring it on
you can't just simply compare the two
why?
they're from two different generations
so again, whose better
2-Pac was king during his time Drake is soo talented
you haven't really given me a clear distinction
i'll go with 2-pac man, he was king,still is
even after listening to more life?
okay, i think Drake is talented musically
so drake?
yeah, drake it is
