Hey, do you like the marvel movies?
Those are great action movies! Can't wait for the new Thor one.
Black Panther is going to be great too, I hope that one does really well.
I hope it does as least as great as Wonderwoman, you know. Really break some records out there.
Wonderwoman was amazing! It really was directed well with plenty of great action near the end.
Reminds me of the feeling of Guardians of the Galaxy, really. That sense of loss then pulling out the win at the end.
Both did have that punch moment, true. It has the whole drawing you in and making you really feel.
Speaking of action movies, Pacific Rim was another great one.
I didn't like that one as much, but the concept was truly unique.
Come on, giant robots? What's not to like?
