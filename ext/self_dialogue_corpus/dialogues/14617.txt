Do you think Lebron is going to win the NBA Championship this year?
I am not sure, I do not think the Cavs have enough good players around him.
Yeah, but they added Kyle Korver and have been shooting threes great.
That is the key if they can shoot well I think Lebron can win another championship.
More threes than the Golden State Warriors at least.
You think the Warriors will make it to the Finals?
Yeah I think the Spurs will lose to the Rockets, and the Rockets cant beat the Warriors even with James Harden.
I would love to see that Western Conference Final of Harden against Curry.
Who do you think is the better 3pt shooter?
I definitely think Steph Curry is the best shooter in the game.
You think he will do better this year in the Finals if they play the Cleveland Cavaliers again?
Yeah that was a fluke for Curry to play that poorly last year.
I know I still cannot believe that they lost after being up 3 to 1 in the series.
That was an epic comeback from the Cavaliers to be able to do it.
There is no way that even with Lebron they come back without Kyrie Irving.
I agree Kyrie Irving was the most important and valuable player in that series.
If he plays like that again I think the Cavaliers would beat the Warriors in the Finals.
Not if Curry and Thompson play at the same level, the Warriors have to many weapons to only the Cavs Lebron and Kyrie.
Yeah but Lebron is like three of the Warriors players, he is the best in the world.
I agree he is the best in the world, if they play in the finals again it will be a great match.
