I really love Carlos Santana.
Yea Santana was a great band.
He is one of the greatest guitar players ever I think.
He was a Mexican American artist.
Yup and he had a Latin American rock sound.
He played at Woodstock.
And right after that his debut album came out.
I think Evil Ways was on that album.
That was a good song and so was Black Magic Woman.
You know I saw him on a tv talk show not too long ago.
Really, what was he up too.
He actually just put out a new cd.
Was he promoting it.?
I suppose so, and he was going out on tour.
Oh I would like to see him play again.
Oh have you seen Santana?
Yes in the early 70's, I think it was 1973 because I drove there.
That must have been a good show.
It was, they were the opening act for the Allman Brothers.
Wow, two great bands!!
