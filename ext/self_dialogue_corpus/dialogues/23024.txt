What is your favorite Disney movie?
"Lion King."
Did you know it was based off of Hamlet?
I did not but that makes so much sense.
Yeah, that's why I'm not a super big fan of it.
But you have to admit the sound track is incredible.
Oh, most definitely.
"Hakuna Matata" is one of my all time favorite feel-good songs.
What other Disney movie do you really like?
The Little Mermaid.
Aw, I used to watch that all the time when I was a little girl.
Me too! I loved Ariel so much.
I really looked up to her.
Same! There was a while I used to wish I could become a mermaid at every birthday for a while.
That's too funny.
What's your favorite Disney movie?
I know it's Pixar, but I really like Toy Story.
Aw, Buzz and Woody are friendship goals.
I have to agree!
The third one made me so sad.
