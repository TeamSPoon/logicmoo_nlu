So what did you feel about the force awakens?
To be honest I freaked out because it was so good!
How did you feel about the characters.
I really enjoyed Finn's character and Ray.
Yes! They fit well together.
And the action scenes with them kept me on the edge.
I was so shocked that Ray had the force.
I was as well. But even more shocked that she was stronger than Kylo.
And Kylo's light saber was so awesome looking!
That light saber battle at the end was so epic as well.
