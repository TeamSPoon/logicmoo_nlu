Is Toy Story considered a Disney movie?
Kind of. Disney bought Pixar. So, they do own the characters.
Toy Story is my favorite Disney movie. Lion King is my favorite too.
You can't have two favorites of any same medium. You have to pick one.
Okay. Frozen is my favorite Disney movie.
Frozen? You didn't mention that one before.
Sheesh! I have too many favorite Disney movies to count.
All Disney movies can't be your favorites! Only one can be your favorite.
Well Tom Hanks is Woody and Tim Allen is Buzz. Can't they just both be my favorites?
NO!
