I'm glad the British Invasion happened.
Me too. It brought out some of the best rock music ever.
Led Zeppelin led the pack in that era.
I liked The Who.
Didn't The Who make a musical?
Yes, it was called "Tommy".
My favorite Who song is Eminence Front.
That was one of the few songs that Roger Daltrey wasn't the lead singer on.
All in all I still think Led Zeppelin had more hits than The Who.
I think that you are right about that.
