How do you think Drew Brees will do this season?
I don't know but I'm excited to see.
Do you think this will be Drew Brees' last season?
Yeah. I think it's about time for him to retire.
Can the Saints go all the way this year?
I hope so. We have some pretty decent commitments so we'll see!
Do you think this is Sean Peyton's last year?
Without a doubt. He looks like he's ready to retire.
Do you really think the Rams and the Browns will lose every single game?
Based on their team and how many odds are stacked against them, yep!
How do you think Brandin Cooks will work out with the Patriots?
I think he'll be just fine. Still can't believe we lost him!
They're saying Aaron Rodgers is the best QB in the NFL. Do you agree?
He's great but I do think there's better. I'd love to say Drew Brees but last season was awful!
How do you feel about the rules to the Touchdown celebration dance getting more relaxed?
I LOVE it! I mean c'mon, half of those people will only do that once in their lifetime, let them celebrate!
I'm hearing the Cowboys are looking good. Do you think they will live up to the hype?
I hope not. The top 3 teams I despise are Falcons, Bucs, and Cowboys.
Do you think it's a good idea for Amazon to stream the NFL games?
I do. I think it will bring more business to Amazon and make the people who already have Prime happy!
