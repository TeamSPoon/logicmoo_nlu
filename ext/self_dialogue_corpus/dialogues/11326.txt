Who is your favorite Beatle?
I don't know, they were before my time so I only know the music.
Yeah, me too.  I really like their music.
Yeah, I like their later stuff more than their early stuff.
I like it all, their early stuff is fun.
Yeah, it is but Yellow Submarine and others are cool
This is true, I even like a lot of their individual stuff.
Me too, I think they all made some great music individually.
I agree.
Yeah, they were really good.
