Sometimes I don't know how to feel about Dumbledore as a character. He was awfully manipulative.
Yeah, but he make sure Harry survived, didn't he?
He took a lot of unnecessary chances though. He also lied to everyone around him, especially Harry and Snape.
Well, he was trying to keep Voldemort from finding out about what they were doing, wasn't he?
I guess, but his methods seem really harsh, especially where Snape is concerned.
Lying to him about Harry having to die and all that?
Yes, not to mention forcing Snape to kill him so that Voldemort would believe that Snape was master of the Elder Wand.
Is that why he did it? I thought it was because he wanted Snape to take over at Hogwarts and protect the children.
Well, that was part of it. But like everything he did, he had multiple reasons.
Yeah, I guess he was pretty tricky.
