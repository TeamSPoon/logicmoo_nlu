Did you ever hear of the band The Velvet Underground?
Yes, they were a band from the sixties
Yea they were, Lou Reed was the main man.
Oh yea he had some really risque lyrics for the time period.
Yes, now days that is nothing.
They were a pretty revolutionary band for the time with the loud music.
What songs did they do?
I heard her call my name, I'll be your mirror and one even called Heroin.
Wow, I guess they were pretty revolutionary singing about Heroin.
Yea, definitely.
They put out over 20 albums.
I know but I think I am only familiar with one of them.
Yea I did not listen to them too often.
Lou Reed played with other bands too.
I know and on his own.
Remember the song Take a Walk on the Wild Side?
Yes I do!
My dad hated that song.
Well, I guess the older generation would not like it maybe.
Yea I suppose so.
