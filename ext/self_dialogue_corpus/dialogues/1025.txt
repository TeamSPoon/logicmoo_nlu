I think this is the year the Raiders finally go deep in the playoffs.
Are you serious?
I am serious.  I think that Carr is good and so is their defense.
Well they did have a good season last year.
I think they are the trendy pick goign into the season.
Whatever happened with them moving to Las Vegas?
I'm not sure if it got approved.
It would be weird to see them in Vegas.
Well they did move a few times already.
That is true. The were in Los Angeles at one point.
Who is your pick to win it all?
That's a tough call but I'm going to say the Cowboys.
They sure looked great last year except for their defense is lacking.
I think they drafter some good rookies that can fill in right away.
Well drafting is smart because those players are cheaper then free agents.
The Cowboys like to pay big money to free agents, but I think they are changing that philosophy.
It would be wise for them to do so.
I agree building from within like the Patriots can lead to sustained success.
They are the NFL blue print that every team should follow.
Having Tom Brady isn't hurting them either!
