Hi Jack!
Hi Nancy, I wanted to ask if you wanted to go to the movies?
Thanks!  That sounds fun. What did you have in mind?
Well, I haven't seen the Guardians of the Galaxy yet.  Have you?
The second movie of the Guardians of the Galaxy?  No I haven't
Ok great, what do you think about seeing it?
Sounds like it would be fun.  Who is playing in it?
Chris Pratt, Vin Diesel, and Brad Cooper also play in it.
I think I would like it, it looks very fun!
And there is anotehr movie as well I think you would like, just to see which one we will decide on.
Okay, which other one were you thinking of?
King Arthur is playing as well.
Ah yeah, that one looks okay, who is playing in it?
That would be Charlie Hunnam and Jude Law.
I think the first one sounds best, let's go see the Guardians.
Ok, sounds good.
Do you want to go to dinner before the movie?
Sure, let's go to Taco Bell and then to the movie at 7pm
Sounds great!
See you!
