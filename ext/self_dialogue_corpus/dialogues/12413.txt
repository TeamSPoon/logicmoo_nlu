Don't you love Daisy Ridley
Yes, she's great in the new star wars movies.
I also love that harrison ford and carrie fisher were in the movies
I know that was wonderful
They really made up for how bad the prequels were
I think so for sure
George Lucas really messed those up
I did like Natalie Portman though
I hated her
Samuel Jackson is pretty great in those films too.
