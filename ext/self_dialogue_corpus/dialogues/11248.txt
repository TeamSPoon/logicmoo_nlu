Do you like my tie?
No it has too much going on.
How do you like my tie? It's azul
Blue is a nice colour on you it compliments your eyes
I think complimenting my eyes is important.
How else do you like to express your dress?
Well that is a funny way to say fashion
Suits and ties are not always fashionable.
Have you read the latest issue of vouge?
No I haven't
They have an excerpt on ties and how to successfully dress.
What did they say about complementing the eyes?
They said it was a very hot thing to do.
Well I am not sure if I would use the word hot
Right me niether
So what is the rest of the issue about?
Oh, you now ca-tour dresses from Spain and the latest happenings in paris
Wasn't it fashion week last week
I don't think so, I think fashion week is in the fall.
Oh that's right where is my sense for fashion
