You know Dallas is no 2 in term,s of rushing offense.
All Zeke and Dak. Dak has more rushing yards than his no 2 running back who is Morris.
Yep. Can't believe BUffalo is no 1 in rushing. LeSean McCoy and Tyrod Taylor.
And Tyrod has more rushing yards than HIS no 2 running back.
Dual threat QB in the NFL isn't always the best
NFL is so evenly matched, it doesn't really matter that much.
What, having a dual threat QB doesn't matter? or that rushing doesn't matter?
Dual threat QBs
Right, gotcha.
WEird thign is that the Pats are no 7 in rushing yards, and no 5 in rushing TDs, no 4 in passsing yards, and no 6 in passing TDs
How can they be the superbowl champions? it makes no sense.
it has to do with the points per game. That's the best stat.
Patruiots'  points per game is still only no 3. No 1 is Atlanta.
Funny thing is New Orleans. They're no 2, but haven't been to the Superbowl in years.
2009 was the last time.
And Drew brees is one of the better QBs in the league
And they do put up the numbers.
No 2 in points/game,  no 1 in yards/game, no 1 in passing yards/game, no 16 in rushing yards/game...
Maybe that's the key. Rushing yards per game
Not really, because top rushing team are Buffalo. Dallas, Tenessee, San Francisco.
