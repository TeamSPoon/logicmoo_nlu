They're having a sale at the record store downtown, do you want to go with me after we get off work?
Sure, I could use some new cds to listen to in the car. What's the sale prices?
It said 30% off of select artist cds and albums, and there were some cool rock band cds in the ad.
That sounds good, what kind of bands were they?
They had Imagine Dragons, Breaking Benjamin, U2, and Red Hot Chili Peppers in the ad.
OH, I really like Imagine Dragons. I was listening to a song on the radio the other day, Demons, and I loved the way they sang that song.
I listen to the radio in the car sometimes, but I got a new car cd player for Christmas, so now I've been listening to a lot of cds while I drive.
What cds have you been listening to?
A lot of old rock bands. I was jamming to AC/DC on the way to work this morning, singing yeah you, shook me all night long.
That's hilarious. We'll have to play it on the way to the record store when we get off work.
