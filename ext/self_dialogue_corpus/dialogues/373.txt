What is the most unbelievable scene in a superhero movie for you?
For me, it's anything where the human body doesn't crumble under physics: like Iron Man smacking into the ground.
Yeah, his insides should be mush after that.
Yours?
Everything about the pit in The Dark Knight Rises.
Why's that?
Well, we learned the medical technique of using ropes to repair a broken spine!
That's not all, though.
What else?
You can't actually break someone's back like that. It'll hurt but your spine will curve naturally.
