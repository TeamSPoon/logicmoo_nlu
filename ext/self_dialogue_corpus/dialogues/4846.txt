Hey did you see the baseball game last night?
What baseball game?
The home game between the Bears and the Wings!
No, I didn't even know they were playing.  When did the season start?
This was the opening game.
Oh wow, I hadn't even heard about it.
Yeah, the stands were packed.
Where was it?
It was at Armfield Park, the old ball field, remember?
Oh, I thought they were building a new stadium downtown.
They are but it's not ready yet.
Oh wow.  So who won the game?
The bears did.
Really?  I thought the Wings would win for sure.
Yeah so did I, they had a much better team last year.
Yeah that's what I thought
but that new coach they got apparently is no good.
really?  That Daniels guy?
Yes, the new one from Florida.
Oh, I had heard he was supposed to be great.  Hmm, that's really disappointing.
