Did you ever see the Disney movie version of The Sword in the Stone?
I think I did, but it's been years since I saw it.
I was just thinking about it the other day and how crazy it was.
I really don't remember much about it other than a scene where the characters turn into fish and sing a song.
I remember that! Do you remember the part where the characters are fighting and the witch turns into different animals?
I think so. It was such a fun movie from my recollection.
I think we should watch it soon. There aren't too many other movies like it out there.
I guess you're right. Not many movies have singing fish scenes these days.
I can't wait to see if it holds up to my childhood expectations!
We'll find out soon enough.
