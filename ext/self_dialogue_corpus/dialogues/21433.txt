Do you like Tarantino movies?
Yeah, I like his style.
What's your favorite movie from him?
I'd have to say Kill Bill.
What did you like about it?
I liked the effects and fight scenes.
Who was your favorite character?
The blonde one. I don't remember her name.
Oh, Uma Thurman, she's in a lot of his movies.
Yeah, she's very tall.
She did the fighting scenes well.
Yeah, she's pretty athletic.
I'm thinking of watching Kill Bill two. Is it good?
It's alright but not as good as the original.
How come?
There's a lack of scenery and fight scenes.
So you think it's less visually appealing?
Yeah, I like movies more for the visuals than the plot.
That's understandable thanks for your input.
Anytime, we should watch a movie later.
