I've been thinking--lately I've been feeling like heist movies are my favorite genre.
Heist movies? Why?
I think it has to do with coming up with the scheme. I really like those parts.
Those are always fun.
And then watching it play out is really exciting.
It is satisfying.
What kind of movies are your favorites?
I don't think I have a particular kind of movie I like best.
Really? What are your favorites then.
I really like The Virgin Suicides.
Didn't Sophia Coppola direct that?
Yeah. And the plot is really engrossing.
I've never seen it. Think I'd like it?
Maybe. What other kinds of movies do you like?
When I was a kid my favorite was Home Alone.
I think of that as a Christmas movie.
I also really liked Galaxy Quest.
All of these are either action or comedy. Maybe you wouldn't like The Virgin Suicides.
That's too bad!
You could give it a shot anyway if you wanted.
