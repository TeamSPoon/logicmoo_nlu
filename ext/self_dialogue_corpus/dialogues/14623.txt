Hey did you see the game last night?
Which game?
The basketball game between the Golden State Warriors and Utah Jazz?
Yes it was good, Steph Curry hit a bunch of threes.
Yes, he did they beat the Utah jazz 121 to 95.
Wow, can you say blowout?
It was such a good game there coach Steve Kerr is doing a great job with them
Yeah, I remember when he was on the Chicago bulls he was a good player as well.
I think the players on the Golden state warriors are all skilled.
Yeah, they all pretty much can shoot 3's and dribble really good.
Not only that, there defense is really on point.
Do you think there going to win the Championship this year?
I hope so, that would be cool being thats my hometown.
I think this is going to be an interesting season.
Yeah, they might get to do a repeat and play against Cleveland Cavilers.
Yeah, that would be awesome.
Hopefully the warriors can stop Lebron James Kyrie Irving
That team has a lot of talent but i think the warriors will beat them this year.
