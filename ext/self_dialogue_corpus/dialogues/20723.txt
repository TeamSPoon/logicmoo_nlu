Have you seen the new Fast and Furious movie?
Not yet.  I want to. I just don't know if I can.
Why not?
I think it will be too weird watching it without Brian.
Oh yeah.  I did notice the fact that he was missing.
Wasn't it too weird?
No. In fact, they made references to him in the movie.
Really, like what?
I don't want to spoil it for you.
Please tell me. It is ok if it is spoiled.
Ok. One instance is where Dom is talking about "the Buster" and how he would do his cars.
Awe. I loved the Buster. What else?
The only other thing is, and this is what really got me, is that Dom named his son Brian.
Oh, I bet I would cry at that moment!
I did!
Awe I have to watch it now!
Do you think they will continue to make the movies now that he's gone?
I hope so. They are hard to watch without him but I still love them!
I know! Love that Dwayne Johnson is such a big part of these movies now.
Me too. I love him!
