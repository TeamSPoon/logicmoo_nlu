Did you know they made a live-action He-Man movie?
I had no idea, what is it called?
It's just called "Masters of the Universe."
Huh, when did it come out?
It was released in 1987.
I see. Orko was always my favorite character in He-Man.
Oh they actually left him out of the movie since it was too hard to make him float.
That's too bad. Who all is in the movie?
Dolph Lundgren plays He-Man.
Wasn't he the Russian guy in one of the Rocky movies?
Yes, that's correct.
So was the Masters of the Universe movie any good?
No, it was actually quite bad. It's mostly in suburban 1980s Earth.
That is surprising. What are they doing there?
He-Man gets sent there by a magic portal but he loses it and some teens think it's a synthesizer.
That sounds kind of goofy.
Then they defeat the villains with the power of rock and roll.
That sounds very 1980s.
It really is. I saw it on Netflix though, if you want to check it out.
Thanks, I just might.
