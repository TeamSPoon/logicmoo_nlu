There, there. what was THAT call about?
Hang on. Let me see. Oh, it's a double dribble.
Double dribble. What kinda rule is that?
This is an NBA game and we get a double dribble call. ridiculous.
Ok. So what is it?
You can only use one hand when dribbling. If you use both hands to touch the ball, and don;t shoot but go back to dribbling, that's called a double dribble.
So what happens now?
Well, the ball goes to the opposing team at where the penalty occurred.
Well, that sucks
This wasn't even intentional, If you look at Hinrich right before the call, he fumbles the ball and drops it and accidentally touches it with both hands.
Yeah it looks like he tripped or something.
When they miss the calls is when you get really pissed
like what?
Like, when the referees missed that same double dribble call on Johnson during raptors and trail blazers game
And they didn't call it?
Forget not calling they didn't even notice. It was a ridiculously obvious too.
Well that sucks.
Wait until you catch traveling call in the NBA.
What's that?
Traveling is when a palyer carries the ball without dribbling more than 2 steps. Kimbal Walker walked 5 steps before dribbling the ball. it was ridiculous. There are a bunch more. Traveling is more common than double dribble in NBA.
