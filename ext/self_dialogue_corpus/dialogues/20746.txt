What do you know about the movie The Giver?
The one with Jeff Bridges and Meryl Streep, was predictable.
How so?
The boy that doesn't feel like he quite fits in, destined to be something great.
So you're saying he, Jonas, is the hero?
I don't think he is the hero as much as the person selected to start a new cycle of life.
Who do you think the hero in this movie is and why?
I think Jeff Bridges character is. He kept his moral compass north, to try to get a people to not be controlled.  He wanted to set them free.
Is this movie like any other movie you have seen?
It is like the movie pleasantville with Reese Witherspoon and Tobey McGuire. Seeing every thing in black and white and not feeling emotions, being curious or loving.
I also think this movie reminds me of Aeon Flux, with Charlize Theron because they are man made people that memories are supressed.
I agree, but with no killing and fighting.
Did the giver movie leave you with any questions?
I want to know who lives in the house at the end of the snow hill where he sled to. Some one has to because there are christmas lights hung, unlike in the memory that Jeff Bridges passed on.
If you had to guess, who would it be?
I think it could be Jeff Bridges wife.  Rosemary was his daughter and in order to know that he had to married and had a baby.
Why didn't Jeff Bridges just cross the boundry and give them their memories?
He said he needed to stay and wait, for when they do get these memories they will need someone to guide them and help them understand them.
Do you think that people were already getting some kind of emotion and feeling before he crossed the boundry.
Yes, because his friends fiona and Asher were trusting of him and would do anything he asked.  Even if it was breaking the rules. His dad took the baby Gabe to try to save him and give him a chance at life.
