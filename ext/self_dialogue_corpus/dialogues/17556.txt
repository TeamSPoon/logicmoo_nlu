Hey how's it going. What are you listening to?
Skillet.
What in the word is Skillet?
Haven't you heard of them? They are great.
No I have not. What kind of band are they?
They are considered Christian Rock.
Christian Rock. I always thought Christian music was old people music.
No way. Christian music has all genres now. Rock and alternative Christian are my favorites.
Wow that is cool. What kind of songs do they have?
I am listening Hero right now. Want to listen?
Sure. Oh this is good.
Yeah, and they are a husband and wife band which is really awesome.
Really husband and wife? That is really neat.
Yeah they formed in the mid 90s and have really grown in time.
That is neat. What are some other Christian Rock groups?
Well Mercy Me is a really good band. They are classified as Rock, but I think they're more alternative in style.
Not a huge fan of alternative. What are some others?
You may like Switch Food, or P.O.D. I do not have any of theirs downloaded though. Sorry.
Oh no worries. Which of those is your favorite.
It would be P.O.D. To be honest.
