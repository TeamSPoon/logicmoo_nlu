I have been listening to a weird mix of music lately
From  a lot of genres?
Yes. like Paul Simon and then Chance the rapper and then Brandi Carlile
I feel like a lot of people have mixed tastes these days.
It's just so easy to get music on spotify
Right, I can't choose.
I end up sampling a little bit of everything.
I even started listening to orchestral music!
Have you heard room full of teeth?
I have. She's a genius.
Truly. I also like acapella music.
Eh, I never really got into that all much.
I understand. it can be corny.
Pentatonix is pretty talented though.
I like their Dolly Parton cover.
That was good.
I also liked the Dixie Chicks playing with beyonce.
Oh yes that was amazing
I can't stop listening to lemonade.
It is amazing.
