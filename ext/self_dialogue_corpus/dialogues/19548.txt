Oh, I really like this song - turn it up.  Who sings this?
Its the singer Ms. X, she's been around for a while now
She has?  I've never heard of her before.  She has other songs out?
Yeah, shes actually from Country XYZ, so she's really big over there, but this is her first song in English, I think
Oh wow, I didnt know that.  How did you first hear about her then?
remember that exchange student from last year?  He listened to her and introduced me to her.
I wish I know what she was saying because I really like this song.  it seems like a cool mix of styles.
Yeah. I think her father is from Country ABC and her mother is from DEF, so it's an interesting mix of cultures.
Oh, wait - her voice sounds familiar, didn't she do that song that was in the commercial recently?
Yeah, I think so, I think they used that to begin her cross over appea
it think it must be so hard for singer to cross over and begin singing in a completely different language
Well, I think I read  from another interview that she grew up speaking a little English, but she didnt really write any songs in English, so this was her first time.
Oh wow - do you know if the complete album is out now or just the single?
I think I saw her on some late night talk show saying that her album is coming out next week, I think
Nice.  I may have to get it - will her songs be in both languages?
Yeah, I think so - that would be awesome.
Is she touring now?
I looked it up and looks like shes opening up for a few major acts at this years music festival
i've been wanting to go to that festival, lets try to get tickets and see her live.
that would be really good, but lets buy her album before we see her live, though.
