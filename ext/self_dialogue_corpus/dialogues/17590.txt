Have you listened to the new Katy Perry album?
No, I haven't yet. What's the name of the title?
It's called "Witness."
What's the first single from the album?
Her first single was called "Chained to the Rhythm."
Is it any good?
To be honest, I like her older music better.
What's your favorite Katy Perry single?
There are a number of sappy good ones, but I would have to go with "Firework" as my favorite.
Are there other musicians that sound like her?
At the risk of sounding old, I think that a lot of artists sound the same today. But you can't talk about Katy Perry without mentioning her supposed rival, Taylor Swift.
Really? Doesn't she sing country music?
She started in country, but her music always had a poppy feel to it. A couple of years ago she went ahead and crossed over to pop music.
Has she been successful?
Very much so! She seems to be taking the mantle of pop princess.
Why are they rivals?
It's kind of complicated and silly, but apparently revolves around a backup dancer.
Does Taylor Swift have any good singles since going pop?
It seems like every single she releases is a hit, but her single "Shake it Off" was pretty big.
Wow, I heard a cover of that song by the band Screaming Females for the Onion's AV Club!
