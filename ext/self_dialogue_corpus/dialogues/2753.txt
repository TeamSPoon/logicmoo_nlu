Who do you think are the top 10 running backs of all time?
All time? Or do you mean in recent history.
All time. The best ever.
Ok, easy, Jim Brown.
Yea, but Jim Brown is going to be everyone's number one.
Ok then, my number two pick would be Barry Sanders.
Yea! Barry Sanders was awesome.
Yes he was.
Ok who else?
Hmm, I guess Emmitt Smith.
Emmitt Smith was a beast.
Yea, and he can dance to.
What do you mean?
I think he won Dancing with the Stars.
No way! Really?
Yea, you should watch it on youtube or something.
That's funny. Hey what about Walter Payton?
Oh yea, I forgot about Walter. I might have to put him above Emmitt.
Yea I definitely put him before Emmitt.
Walter was amazing, plus I heard he was the nicest guy in person.
