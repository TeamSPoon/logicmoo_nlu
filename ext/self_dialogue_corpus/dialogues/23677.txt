I've been wanting to see Donnie Darko.
Have you ever seen it?
I think I had seen bits and pieces of it a while back, but I actually want to see it now.
What is it about?
It's about this guy and I think he's having hallucinations.
Is he on drugs or something?
I don't remember.  I think he's just mental.
Wow, that sucks.  When is this movie from?
I want to say early 2000s.
I don't know if I remember it.
The theme song was "Mad World."
I think I know the song you are talking about, but I'm not sure of the show.
The guy kept seeing this weird rabbit.
Seeing a rabbit?
Well, it was a person dressed as a rabbit.
Oh, that kind of rings a bell.
Yeah, he's going crazy seeing a rabbit person everywhere.
What happens to him?
I don't remember.
Sounds interesting.  I guess that's why you want to see it.
