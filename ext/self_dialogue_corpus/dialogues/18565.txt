Did you know that Debbie Harry has a new song?
Do you mean Blondie?
Yes.
No, I didn't.
It's pretty good.
She's got to be old, isn't she?
She is 71 I think.
Wow, and she's still singing.
Her voice is still great.
So she has a new album. What's it called?
Pollinator.
Weird name.
Yes. I heard a single from it. I can't remember the name.
You said it was good though.
It is. Her voice is still amazing.
How does she look?
Sort of the same , just older.
She still have that blonde hair?
Of course, she's Blondie.
Stupid question I guess.
