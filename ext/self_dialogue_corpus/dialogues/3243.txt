What is your favorite movie?
I like The Revenant.
Oh yeah that is a good one.  Leo is so good in it.
Yeah he won the Oscar for that role I believe.
Yeah he did.  It took him forever to win one.
Yeah but at least he won it for a good role instead of being given one later just because.
True.
So what is your favorite movie then?
Mine is The Prestige.
Oh I have never heard of that one.
