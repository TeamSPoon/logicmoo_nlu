Any thoughts on the upcoming NFL season?
Yes,it's going to be fun.
Right,if you're a New England fan.
I know what you mean there.
They should be right at the top again.
They are every year.
It doesn't seem to matter who they get or who they lose.
It's a great organization with a great coach.
And a great quarterback.
That's for sure.
Do you think Tom Brady will ever slow down?
He's showing no signs of it.
He says he wants to play ten more years.
Won't he be around fifty?
He will be fifty I believe.
If anyone can he can.
I suppose your right.
It's possible Denver or the chiefs can make a run at them.
If things break right,yes.
I know New England will certainly be in the hunt again.
