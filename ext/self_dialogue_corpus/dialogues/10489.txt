Hey, how are you today?
Hi, I'm good. The weather is great.
I agree, have you had a good month?
Yeah, it's been pretty good anything new with you?
I'm going to see Kasey Chambers next week, pretty excited about that.
Never heard of her, what's she sing?
She's not very popular so not many people have heard of her, country folk music.
I thought you didn't like country?
I don't but her music just spoke to me at the right time.
What do you mean by that?
Well one of the lyrics was "we're all gonna die someday."
That sounds really dark.
Nah, it's a really cheery song you should listen to it sometime.
Maybe I will, it sounds interesting.
In that song one of the lyrics is "it hurts down here cause we're running out of beer, but we're all gonna die someday."
That's a really funny lyric. Sounds like I might like the humor in it.
Even if you don't like country you'd probably like her, just like me.
I'll be sure to wear my cowboy hat when I listen to her.
You know I'll be wearing mine at the show!
Yee haw! Go get 'em cowboy!
