I'm thinking of going to see a movie this weekend.
That sounds like fun! What are you going to see?
I'm thinking of seeing Baby Driver. Would you like to come with me?
I'd love to. I haven't heard of the movie, though. What's it about?
I have been trying to avoid spoilers, but as far as I understand, it's about a getaway driver who wants to get out of the lifestyle.
That could definitely be a good time. Who's in it?
Ansel Elgort plays the driver, Baby. It also stars Jon Hamm, Jon Bernthal, and Eiza Gonz√°lez.
Cool. I don't know of Ansel Elgort, but I know I love Jon Hamm in just about everything he does.
Yeah, I agree, he's a great actor.
Do you know who directed Baby Driver?
Edgar Wright directed it.
I think I've heard of him, what else has he done?
You'd probably know him from Hot Fuzz and Shaun of the Dead.
Oh yeah! I loved those movies. I knew I'd heard of him. He directed The World's End, too right?
Yep. And did you know he also did Scott Pilgrim vs. the World?
No, I didn't. That's crazy! I love that one too. Wow, I didn't realize he'd made so many good comedies.
Yeah, I'd say he's probably my favorite comedic director working right now.
I can certainly see why.
That's why I can't wait to see Baby Driver this weekend!
Now you've definitely got me excited, too.
