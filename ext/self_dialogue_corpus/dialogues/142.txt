Do you think they will make another iron man sequel?
How many have there been 2 or 3?
3, did you not see them all?
I think i just forgot, I know I saw 1 and 2 not 100% on the third installment.
Oh man ,you are missing out if you haven't, it was really good.
Well I am guessing he doesn't die off if you think they could make yes another sequel.
Ha sorry if that was  a spoiler for you, you should still watch it.Don Cheadle is great and gwyneth paltrow as well.
I always did like pepper potts, paltrow's character. I think Cheadle is always an entertaining actor on screen.
I hope they are both in the next sequel if there really is one to be made.
I wonder if Downey will do it again, he must be getting tired of this role a little with all the iron mans and aveneger's films.
