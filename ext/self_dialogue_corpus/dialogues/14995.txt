Do you like the comedy movie Baywatch?
I'm not sure, I have not seen it.
Do you plan on seeing it?
Maybe, how was it?
It was awesome, the Rock is a great actor.
I know he is, I really enjoy his movies.
When do you plan on going to see it?
Maybe this weekend since you like it that much.
You really should, it was amazing.
Thanks for the advice, I will go see it soon.
