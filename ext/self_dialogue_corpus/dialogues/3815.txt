Did you ever end up seeing "Don't Breathe".
I'm not sure I know what movie that is.
It's the thriller movie where they break into a blind veteran's house.
Oh, now I remember. Was it any good?
It wasn't that great. It's a shame because I thought the concept was amazing.
Yeah, the trailer looked like it had some intense moments.
There were a lot of "jump scares" in the movie. The acting was pretty bad, though.
Yeah, scary movies sometimes suffer from that.
It was cool to see the main villain have a handicap like that, though.
Yeah, usually they're just super powerful. It sounds unique in that way.
