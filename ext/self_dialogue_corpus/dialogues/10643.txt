Tyrese has to be my favorite character in the Fast and Furious series. He's just so funny.
Roman Pearce! He's got the best one liners. He's pretty much the comic relief of the series now.
I love how he makes light of the situations they get in and he's always the one who has to struggle through.
The last one, Fate of the Furious, he was hilarious in that.
I loved when he took the Lamborghini out to the ice and everyone looked at him like he was crazy for taking that type of car out to that environment.
That scene was wild. I loved the craziness that was the submarine they were trying to out run.
I've never seen a car chase involving a submarine before. A first for everything!
I mean it was great because it was a submarine, but that submarine was also launching torpedoes at the cars!
I'm trying to think of another scene in the series or any other movies that had something that outrageous.
I'm drawing a blank, but Fate of the Furious had a lot of over the top moments!
