Are you excited to see the new Marvel movie?
Which one? There's a few coming out.
Spider-Man Homecoming is the one I was talking about
Oh! I thought you were thinking about Black Panther.
I forgot that it's coming out actually.
Yeah it's not till next year unfortunately.
Well if your interested in seeing some Marvel movies would you want to see Spider-Man Homecoming with me?
I think so, who's in it?
Tom Holland, Robert Downey Jr., and Michael Keaton are the main actors.
I don't know much about Tom Holland, has he been in anything big?
Nothing huge, this is going to be his first big blockbuster.
Wow that's great, I hope it goes well for him! I'm a huge fan of Robert Downey Jr. so I'll go for him alone.
Me too! Ever since Iron Man I've been following his work.
I love Iron Man!
Ever Since Iron Man 2 I knew Marvel movies were going to be huge.
Yeah I agree, I'd even say it started with the first Iron Man.
Possibly, it was definitely the movie that got superhero films into the spotlight.
I agree, I hope that Marvel keeps pumping out good movies.
Me as well, I'm hoping that Spider-Man will be good.
I'm sure it will be, I'm excited to see it with you!
