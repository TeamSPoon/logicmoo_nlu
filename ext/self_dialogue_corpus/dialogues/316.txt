The incredibles was such a fantastic superhero movie
Oh yea, it came out of nowhere too.
The CGI was grea, the voice acting was good.
I really liked the storyline of how superheros were seen and how they lived
Do you think we will ever see a sequel?
It would make so much money, I don't know why they wouldnt.
Sometimes it's good to keep a great movie without potentially ruining it with sequels
There are a lot of bad sequels to good movies
I'm sure if they made a sequel it wouldnt be bad at all.
Here's to hoping Samuel L Jackson gets some more voice acting work with Pixar
