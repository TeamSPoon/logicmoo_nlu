Have you seen the new Wonder Woman movie?
No, I'm not really in to super heroes.
Why not?
It's just so unrealistic
Well, isn't that the point, to escape reality?
Yeah, I get that, but there are just too many super heroes.
Do you like Batman?
Yeah, I actually can handle Batman.
Don't you think he's a superhero?
Not really, he's just a rich guy with gadgets.
So you just don't like super powers?
Basically. I think it's a cheap way to tell a story.
But didn't you always wish for a super power?
I guess it would be cool, but I can't have one so I don't care about the movies.
What type of movies do you like?
Give me a comedy any day.
Any reason for that preference?
I like to watch a movie to escape the world and laugh a bit.
What's your favorite comedy then?
I definitely love Wedding Crashers.
