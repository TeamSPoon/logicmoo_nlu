I am loving the new Suffocation album
How good is it?
It is heavy as can be like feels like mountains falling
I did not like their last one though
It is much better than their last album light years better
I might get it if i can listen to it beforehand this time
Yeah just check their channel
Their youtube channel?
Yeah they posted some songs on their so you can get a taste
That might work to help secure my choice
It would definitely be helpful for you choose
I never knew they went ahead and posted their music on their
Many bands are doing that now adays
Well shoot i might need to check that out before i start  buying albums
it is what i use before buying albums
So do they post the whole album?
Usually it is just a few tracks is all
So never the whole thing then?
Sometimes they do but not often but usually a track or two is enough.
Well you just opened my mind up gonna give those tracks a spin now.
