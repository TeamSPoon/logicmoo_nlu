What do you think of the Pixies?
Who are they?
They were an indie rock band, active around the late 80s and 90s.
You mean like grunge?
Not really, they came before Nirvana, their sound is more unique I think.
Really? What do they sound like?
Someone described their sound as Loud Quiet Loud.
Haha, that sounds funny. But is the music good?
I love them. They have great tunes, very catchy, yet with weird lyrics and weird sounds.
What songs would you recommend?
I love Gigantic from their first album. And Monkey Gone to Heaven is another great song.
Right, I'll check them out on Spotify. What other bands are like them?
Well have you heard the Breeders?
No, who are they?
Kim Deal, one of the members of the Pixies, formed her own band, The Breeders, with mostly women.
Do they sound like the Pixies?
Sort of, but with a more female edge. But both bands really rock.
What album do you recommend?
Last Splash, that's the classic.
Great, thanks!
