What a season the Giants are having!
Yeah, unbelievable, and not in a good way.
After they got Melancon, it seemed like their troubles were over.
Yeah, spring was full of promise...
Until they hit the windshield like a bloated horsefly at 80 MPH.
Then the Bumgarner thing!
Yeah, what was he doing, somersaults on a dirt bike?
Dunno, but his contract's up this year.
Not a good for him heading into negotiations for a big payday.
He's been so cool about it though, never complained.
He'll still do pretty well.
Yeah, but not as well as he would've. Really bad timing.
You know when he's coming back?
It was supposed to be after the All-Star break, but now the Giants are talking August!
Figure if they lose 10 games they might've won with him pitching, there goes the playoffs.
It's going to be tough...
But lately they've shown signs of life.
Reverting to the mean, to some extent.
They couldn't keep losing the way they have.
It's good to Melancon earning his money, too!
