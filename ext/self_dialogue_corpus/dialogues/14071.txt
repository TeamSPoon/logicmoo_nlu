What's your favorite Lady Gaga song?
I like Poker Face the most
That's one is pretty classic. And so catchy!
I also like Bad Romance, one of her most famous songs!
I miss the old music she made
It was so edgy and controversial sometimes
Yeah, her lyrics and her costumes were crazy
Do you have any other songs you still listen to?
I still like Just Dance, it makes me want to dance!
I miss her old stuff, but I like anything she makes too!
