Yeah, I would definitely consider myself a Beatles fan. And by that I mean a fan of their music, not necessarily the guys themselves.
I know... I feel the same.
What is your favorite Beatles album?
Oh wow. Good question. I don't know... The white album maybe, or Sergeant Pepper's.
Good choices. I love those. And Abbey Road. Love it.
Abbey Road. Yes. Actually you're right. I like it even better than Sergeant Pepper's. I Want You was one of my first favorite songs ever.
Oh yes! It's such a trippy, heavy, slightly desperate song. Beautiful.
It's true that there is a bit of discreet desperation, or at least deep, sad, longing in many of the songs of that album.
Yep. Oh Darling comes to mind. Or Because.
Or You Never Give me Your Money. I guess they were starting to feel that fame and success was not all that it cracked up to be.
