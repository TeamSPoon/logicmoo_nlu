Do you enjoy watching thriller movies?
Yeah, the scarier the better. I especially like movies taken from Stephen King books.
Did you see the Stephen King movie "It" that came out on television in 1990?
I think so, wasn't that the one with a clown named Pennywise?
Yes, that's the one. It's the reason I don't like clowns.
Kind of like Stephen King's Cujo. That's the reason I'm afraid of Saint Bernards.
There's a few thrillers about to be released, some might be pretty good.  I'm looking forward to The Mummy.
I saw a recently released thriller called Split. It was pretty good.
I saw Split, didn't think I'd like it, but it turned out to be really good.
I think the thriller I'm most looking forward to is 47 Meters Down. It'll be interesting to see how good of an actress Mandy Moore is in a movie like that.
