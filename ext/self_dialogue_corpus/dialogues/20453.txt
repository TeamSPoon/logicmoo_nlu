What film would you rate a 10/10?
I would have to go with Princess Bride.
Why would you say that?
It is the perfect mix in one movie.
How so?
It has romance, comedy and just enough action to keep you interested.
I did enjoy Andre the Giant in that movie.
I loved when he and Indigo Montaya would create ryhmes.
I like the start when they talked about the Dread Pirate Roberts.
What film would you give a 10/10?
I would have to go Spinal Tap.
I think IMBD only gives it an 8.
It deserves a 10, for sure.
I think that movie went a little far with the dark jokes.
That was the point.
What other films would you give at least a nine out of ten to?
The Good The Bad and The Ugly.
The music alone in that film, makes me give it a 7 out of ten.
I think that one is so similar to Once Upon a Time in the West.
One of the first moves away from the spaghetti westerns that were popular in the sixties.
