Have you heard any new Lady Gaga music lately?
No I haven't. I did hear Bad Romance the other day.
Oh, I like that one. It makes me want to sing along.
Me too. And I did. Even though I don't know all the words.
I don't either, I just stumble along with it.
I think my favorite one is still Paparrazzi.
Yeah, was that her first one?
No I think Poker Face was.
Oh yeah Poker Face, still a good sing-a-long song, too.
I really can't think of a song of hers that I don't like.
