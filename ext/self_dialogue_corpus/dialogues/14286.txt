The San Antonio Spurs are getting killed in this series.
Yeah it is 3-0. They might get swept.
I think they will get swept for sure.
I mean they just don't have enough firepower.
Also with Kawhi Leonard out this series has been a joke
Yeah this has been too easy for the Warriors
I mean after game one this series has not been competitive
Well without Kawhi there almost no point in continuing this games.
Yeah I know. But at least this series will be over after game 4
Yeah the Warriors have been cruising.
I mean almost their entire starting lineup will be in the hall of fame one day
When you look at that roster, it is so unfair
I mean this team was good before they added Durant
Absolutely. Now they are a freaking all star team
I couldn't agree with you more
This Warriors team is going to win the championship
Yeah there is no doubt in my mind
They are undefeated in this post season
And most of the games haven't been close
Yeah they are making a mockery of the league
