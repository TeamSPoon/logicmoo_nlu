Can you name any famous singers that sang for Disney movies? Like Billy Joel sang for Oliver and Company.
Yes, I think Bette Milder sang in that one too. Let me think about it for a minute.
Okay, I will name another while you are thinking. Donny Osmond sang for Mulan..
Peggy Lee sang for Lady and The Tramp.
Really, I did not know that. Mandy Moore sang for Tangled.
Nice, how about Shakira sang for Zootopia.
Let's see, Tevin Campbell sang for A Goofy Movie.
I don't know who that is. I guess it is my turn, Cliff Edwards sang for Pinocchio.
My personal favorite is Phil Harris for The Jungle Book.
That is the cool thing about singing in a Disney movie, it will last forever.
