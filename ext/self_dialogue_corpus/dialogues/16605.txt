Do you like movie music?
You mean the music you hear while you're watching the movie? Sure.
Yes, but I mean listening to like soundtrack albums and stuff.
For certain movies, yes. Like I like when a movie has a bunch of cool songs in it. I'll buy those albums occasionally.
Yeah, me too, sometimes. But I really like the orchestral music. You know, like the love theme or the chase theme or the hero's music.
Oh. I guess so. I mean, I've never bought one of those albums.
I have a bunch of them. People think it's weird sometimes but I just listen to them whenever. If I'm studying or cleaning the house or just doing anything.
Why do people think it's weird?
I don't know. Sometimes they think it's strange to be listening to suspenseful music, for instance, without anything suspenseful going on.
It's just music. How is it different than listening to classical music?
I know. Exactly. But some people think it's odd if you're not listening to songs all the time.
Well, those people are boring.
Ha ha. That's what I think. But yeah, I love stuff like John Williams music or James Horner or older stuff like Henry Mancini or Lalo Shifrin.
Yes, I would listen to them. I've just never really thought about it.
The way I look at it is, if you like music, why wouldn't you like them?
Some people have weird standards. By the way, I take it back: I did buy a soundtrack once.
Oh, you did?
Yes, long time ago. I bought the Star Wars album.
Right, right. That's a good one. A lot of people bought that one.
Yeah, that Darth Vader march is one of my favorites.
