Do you like Steven Spielberg movies?
I do. I'm a big fan of thrillers so I like his thrillers the best.
Oh really? Like which ones?
Well, he did a TV movie called Duel a long time ago with Dennis Weaver. It was one of his first films.
Is that the one about the guy being chased by the evil truck?
That's the one, for sure. Pretty suspenseful. Also a good reminder to keep your road rage in check.
And I think Catch Me If You Can is a thriller too, kind of.
Yeah, I agree. Kind of a thriller/biography.
And War Of The Worlds. Would that qualify?
I suppose. A science fiction thriller, for sure.
