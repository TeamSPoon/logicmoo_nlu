Yesterday I had the opportunity to see Finding Dory.
I saw it months ago. It was very funny. Did  you like it?
A lot! I want to see it again.
By the way, last week Ellen Degeneres in her show was talking about how wonderful was to work in this movie.
She wanted this movie since years ago. She did a nice job.
I think all the cast did a good job. The movie earned thousand of millions in a few weeks.
It's well deserved. It was not the same with The BFG movie. I saw it yesterday too.
The BFG was not the best movie from Steven Spielberg but I did like it.
It was good, but I prefer Finding Dory.
I prefer that too.
