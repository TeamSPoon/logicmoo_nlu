Have you seen the new Fast and Furious movie?
No, you mean The Fate of the Furious?
Yeah number 8. Without Paul Walker. So sad.
Yeah it still kind of pulls at the heart. But no I haven't seen the new one.
I just can't bring myself to see it yet. I will probably wait until it comes out on DVD so I can cry in peace.
Well I don't know about cry, they are usually so action-packed that you don't have time to do much more than eat your popcorn and watch the screen.
You could be right. I just wish Paul Walker was still here. I hate it that he died like that. Well I do think the send off at the end of the last movie was touching and sweet.
It was. When he rode off into the sunset I think that said it all. It had to be hard to come up with an ending that would do him justice. I mean him and Vin Diesel were the movie.
Yeah, family. And in real life too. But I can't wait to see The Fate of the Furious. They have some new people in it like Charlize Theron that should be a good time.
I agree, maybe we'll see it together. Pop some popcorn and get some M&Ms and do it right. RIP Paul Walker.
