Have you seen the new Beauty and The Beast Movie?
No, was it good?
Yes, it was. It was very true to the story.
That is great that they didn't take many liberties with the story line.
Emma Watson wouldn't have been my first choice and I was nervous.
Did you do well?
Yes, I still think she doesn't have a lot of facial expression variety.
Really? That is too bad, what do you mean?
She has the same expression if she is happy, mad, sad or any feeling really.
That is too bad.
Other than that I was extremely impressed.
How were the animated objects?
They were amazing!! I couldn't believe how amazing they were.
Was the movie the same length as the animated version?
Yes, I don't think it was much longer.
That is nice. I don't like movies that are too long.
Me either, the beast was amazing.
How was his transformation?
I loved it, it may have been one of my favorite parts of the movie!
Wow, I will have to see it!
