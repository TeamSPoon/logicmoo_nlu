What's the last Angelina Jolie movie you watched?
I think it was Changeling.
That movie was so sad.
I know. Wasn't it directed by Clint Eastwood?
I think so.
I can't believe he is still directing movies at his age.
Me either. Didn't he just direct Sully?
Yep, that's right.
I loved Tom Hanks in that movie.
He was even better in Captain Phillips.
Oh, I know. That movie had me on the edge of my seat.
The scene where Captain Phillips is rescued is so touching.
I know. Tom Hanks' acting was superb.
Did he win any awards for that role?
I know he was nominated for a Golden Globe.
It's a shame that he didn't win.
I agree. I thought the acting by the main pirate was great as well.
Me too. I can't remember the actor's name that played him.
Me either, but I am sure he received a Golden Globe nomination for best supporting actor for his role.
Wow. That movie must have received a lot of nominations.
