Do you remember that movie about the bed that could take you anywhere?
Bed Knobs and Broomsticks?
Yes, that's it... what a crazy movie that was.
Why would you decide to make a magic flying bed, I mean it's not exactly inconspicuous.
No, I agree.   When they travel to Portobello Road and end up in the middle of the market, surely someone would notice.
Is that the scene where they find part of the book?
Yes, and then realise it's only half of it.  They need to travel to the Isle of Naboombu to get the other park from King Leonidas.
I wouldn't like to have a game of that football match.
No, nor me.  I like my legs in one piece!
What a classic, Treguna, Mekoides, Trecorum, Satis, Dee!
