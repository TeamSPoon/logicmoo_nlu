What did you think of Qui Con Jin?
Obi Wan Kanobi's mentor?
Yes, the one that Liam Neesin plays.
I do not  think they explored him as well as they should have.
I think he was a real strong guy, really intense.
He was the last of the old Jedi. I liked when he fought the SIth.
In the moving doors, yes, so much patience in his fighting.
It was more like a dance. I think it was foreshadowing.
Of what?
Of what would happen to the Jedi if they lost their patience, how they would be killed.
