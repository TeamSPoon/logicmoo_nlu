Did you get a chance to watch the live actions Beauty and the Beast remake?
Yah I watched it. I didn;t really care for it unlike everyone else in the world.
What!? It was exactly like the original. What was wrong about it!
The songs just felt so artificial and there were too many of them!
Yah they did add some unnecessary song in there. I walked out on the Beast's song to use the bathroom.
And the moving objects looked creepy especially the wardrobe with its dead eyes.
Wasn't the dress scene amazing though! Emma Watson looks gorgeous in that iconic gown.
She did I'll admit, and that scene was done well. But everything in that movie I liked better in the animated version.
What about the Gaston song? They added more to it compared to the original.
I don't know! I guess I just was not feeling the whole movie. It could just be me.
