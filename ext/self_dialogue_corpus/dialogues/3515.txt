What is your favorite Lovecraftian horror movie?
That's a tough question to answer, I have so many as that's my favorite sub genre of horror. I think I would have to say Hellraiser and for a guilty pleasure The Midnight Meat Tran.
The Midnight Meat Train is the one with Bradley Cooper and Vinnie Jones right? Vinnie plays the butcher on the subway train that brutally murders passengers?
That's the one. That movie also stars Leslie Bibb and is based off a short from Clive Barker.
I didn't know Clive Barker did a short on it. I remember enjoying the movie as it was very brutal and so bizarre.
That's why it's one of my favorites. You start off thinking Bradley is just trying to get a good shot, as his character was a struggling photographer, then he becomes obsessed with Vinnie Jones character of the butcher that he starts to lose himself.
I had no idea it would turn into a love craft theme horror until that stretch.
I know, not a lot of people understand this specific genre of horror is considered inspired from the books of HP Lovecraft.
I try to explain to people what lovecraftian or love craft horror is by telling them it involves demons, time and space, and just cosmo like elements and they still can't get a grasp of it.
It's somewhat of a tough sub genre to explain because what happens in these movies are so bizarre. It's supernatural but more from the universe rather than straight up aliens, or supernatural demons and ghost.
