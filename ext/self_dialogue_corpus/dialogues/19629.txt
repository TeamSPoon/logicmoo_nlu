Man this is exhausting
What is exhausting?
The practice i am doing
Why is it exhausting?
It hurts my arms a lot
What sort of practice are you doing
I am practicing on my new guitar
you got a new one?
Yeah just got her this week
What sort was she?
A 8 string Ibanez
Sounds fancy
It is quite the fancy one
Did it cost a lot of money
It costed several hundreds to be honest
Whew that makes my wallet hurt
We should get together and make some music sometime
Yeah we most definitely should
Wanna make some plans then
Sure lets do that
