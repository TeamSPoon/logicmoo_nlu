What's up with the Raiders new colors?
The owner is batshit crazy!
that he is!
I heard he want to add Gold to the black and sliver!
I really starting to hate the NFL owners!
me to! theyre so greedy
yup
After the San Diego Chargers left I think this will be my last season as a fan
I hear yah
Im not sure whats going on with the Chargers
I wonder if they are sharing the locker with the Rams?
All I know is Spanos is a ahole!
All he wants to do is sell the team for more money
Its like the owner from Oakland, he looks like Moe from the 3 stogges!
I think all rich NFL owners handle large amount of cash and the ink has seaped into their blood stream
GOLD is he crazy! How many years the Raiders have been Black and Silver?
for ever
yup
I really hope he doesn't change anything!
ONLY TIME WILL TELL!
