Have you heard of the band, First Aid Kit?
I haven't. Do you think I would like them?
I think you would. They're two sisters from Sweden, who are in an indie folk band.
It does sound like I would like them. What are some of their albums?
They have three albums out so far, The Black and the Blue, The Lion's Roar, and Stay Gold.
Which one should I listen to first?
The Lion's Roar, it's the one I like the best. My favorite songs are on it, "The Lion's Roar", "Blue", "This Old Routine", and "Wolf".
I'll make sure to listen to them. Can you recommend any other indie folk bands?
I certainly can. I really like the bands, Gregory and the Hawk, Mumford and Sons, Ingrid Michaelson, and Bright Eyes.
I love Gregory and the Hawk! I can't tell you how many times I've listened to "Boats and Birds".
Same here, except for me it was, "The People Who Raised Me".
What songs did the Bright Eyes release? Their name sounds familiar but I can't remember any of their songs.
I haven't listened to their more recent music. I like their older songs, "First Day of My Life" and "Bowl of Oranges".
Oh, I remember them now! I used to listen to them all the time in high school.
So did I!
They sort of remind me of the band, Never Shout Never.
Yeah, I can see that. I only remember a two of their songs though.
Which songs do you remember?
"On the Brightside" and I think the other one is "Big City Dream".
Those were two of my favorites, and you were close. It's "Big City Dreams".
