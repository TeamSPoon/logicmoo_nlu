Do you think that the Redskins will have a good year this upcoming season?
They should certainly be competitive
Do you think that they will win their division?
They certainly have a chance. All the teams are just about even across the board
I like that the Redskins got Terrelle Pryor and DJ Swearinger in free agency
Yes. They are both very good players and will be starters
Their season will certainly rest on the shoulders of Kirk Cousins
Cousins will certainly have to have a big season if he expects the team to sign him to a big contract
The NFC East is going to be tough. The Eagles are being heralded as the favorites.
It is because they done real good in free agency as well this offseason
Who were some of the players they signed?
LaGarrette Blount, Torrey Smith, Jeremy Maclin, Alshon Jeffrey
Their offense then should be very good.
Yes it will. Plus, it will be another year for Carson Wentz to mature.
The Cowboys should be good as well.
The only problem with Dallas is that their defense is lacking.
The Cowboys offense should be just as good as last year.
Prescott and Elliot will certainly be the key. It is just their defense is going to be their obvious weakness
You certainly cannot forget the Giants.
If Eli can keep the interceptions down, the Giants could certainly be in contention.
