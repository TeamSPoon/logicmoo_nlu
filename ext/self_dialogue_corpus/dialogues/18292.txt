What's your favorite Beastie Boys album?
That's a tough one. I like all of their sounds from hardcore, to the hip hop, to the instrumental stuff.
Well, if you had to pick one.
Maybe Pauls Boutique.
Good choice. Why that one?
It has so many tracks.
A pretty diverse collection of them as well.
B-boy Bouillabaisse is like ten songs in one spliced together.
The whole album is so creative.
Shake Your Rump was such a crazy choice for s single after their Licensed To Ill Album era.
A lot of fans were not happy with what they thought was the albums new sound.
Didn't they have co-producers on Pauls Boutique?
The Dust Brothers.
Did they have any other real singes from the album?
Shadrach, Looking Down The Barrel Of A Gun, A few.
I can't believe how many samples they got away with.
Yeah. It samples The Beatles, Bob Dylan, Public Enemy...
I have The Shake Your Rump and Hey Ladies singles on vinyl.
Anything else on it?
Two sort of remix instrumentals not on the album.
