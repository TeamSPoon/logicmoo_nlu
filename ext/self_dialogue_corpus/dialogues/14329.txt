Who do you think will win the NBA Finals this year?
I'm not sure. Who's playing in it again?
The Cleveland Cavaliers and the Golden State Warriors are in the finals.
Again? That's crazy.
They're the best teams in the league by far.
I think the Warriors will win this year.
Why do you say that?
They have the best team, I think. Curry is unstoppable.
But what about LeBron James?
Well, the Warriors have Curry, Durant, and others. Cleveland can't rely on just LeBron!
That's true. But I think the Cavs will repeat this year.
It's possible. Whoever wins, it's sure to be a great series.
I think it was smart of LeBron to leave Miami and come back to Cleveland.
I think so too. He made a lot of fans angry when he left the first time.
He wanted to win a championship and he couldn't do it in Cleveland.
That's true. But now the Cavs have a team that could win.
You're right about the Warriors though, they have a lot of talent on their team.
Yeah, but they need to make sure to put pressure in the key. They can't rely on offense.
The Cavs too. Basketball is so offensive these days.
Yeah, every team could stand to learn better defense.
