What is your favirote funny movie?
You mean of all time?
Yes! I know it is tough to choose.
I would have to say Zoolander.
Is that the one with Ben stiller?
Yes it is. It is so funny!
I have wanted to see it forever.
You really should watch it. It will be worth your time!
Is Owen Wilson in the movie as well?
Him and Will Farrell both are!
