Not really. The members have moved on to other bands.

His name is Andrew McMahon.
And he has joined another band too?
He did indeed! His band is doing very well.

The name of his new band is Andrew McMahon In The Wilderness.
That is an odd name.
I agree. It is. But the music is fantastic.

They play indie and alternative music.
That is one of my favorite genres.
You should check out the band in that case. They have been getting a lot of radio play lately.
I will listen for them next time I am in the car!
