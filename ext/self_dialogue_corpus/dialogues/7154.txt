I just read that Disney is making another The Incredibles Movie.
Yes I heard about it but didn't know is it was just a rumor.
No it's not. It was one of my favorite Disney movie. My brother saw it a million times. He wanted to be Mr. Incredible
I did too! It was a cool family with superpowers.  I was Elastigirl. When is it coming out?
It's coming out June of 2018. And it will be in 3D
Oh Gosh, I hope I'n not the only adult without kids watching at the theater. Because I will not miss it.
We should make it a friends night out. I have to see it!
Lets do that! it will be less awkward for the other people there.
I wonder what it will be about. I just hope they can bring the same voice cast from the original movie.
Me too. It has to be better than the original, and knowing Disney movies, it will be.
