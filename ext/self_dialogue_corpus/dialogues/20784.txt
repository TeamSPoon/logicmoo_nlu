OK. Do you love Pokemon: The First Movie?
Absolutely. I watched it growing up.
Who was it directed by?
I think... I don't know actually. That's a good question.
The promotional website was www.pokemonthemovie.com
Is that so? I don't remember seeing it.
Is the site still active?
I have no idea. I'll look it up.
Is it active?
I don't know, it's still loading. It would be crazy if it was.
It doesn't look it is. It still hasn't loaded yet.
When was it released?
It was on VHS by 2000. I have a huge collection of VHS cassettes.
I don't. I like online videos and movies.
I know, the quality is probably better.
Yes, and the sound quality too.
And the site won't respond, so it's probably dead.
That's a shame. I wonder what it looked like.
Like any other movie site I guess.
Just promotional I'd assume too.
