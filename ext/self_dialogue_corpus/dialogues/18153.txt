Do you like any rap artists?
I am actually a big Lil Wayne fan.
That's funny, most people just meme on Lil Wayne today.
I know, its rough being a Lil Wayne fan these days.
I don't mind him myself.
Well I've listened to him since I was like 14 or 15 so I grew up with his music during his hay day.
What are your top three favorite Lil Wayne songs.
Oh that's a tough question, I'd have to think about it.
Well they can be from any of his albums or any mixtapes and singles.
I would have to say Leather So Soft, Sky is the Limit, and 3 Peat.
Nice, I like all those as well.
Who is your favorite hip hop artist?
I am into some of the newer artists, I think I'd have to go with Lil Uzi Vert.
I like him too. What is your favorite song by him?
I would have to say 'All My Friends Are Dead' is my favorite song of his currently.
Nice, I saw that song on YouTube recently and it had half a billion views.
He has really caught on lately.
The only thing I'm afraid of is that when people become this popular so quickly they often fade away just as fast.
Yeah I'm hoping that doesn't happen with Lil Uzi Vert.
I don't think it will, I'm just saying it happens sometimes.
