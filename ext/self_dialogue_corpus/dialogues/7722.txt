How do you think the harry potter movies compared to the books.
I think overall they did a really good job with the basic plot, but they could have done better in some of the finer details.
True.  I know they had to cut some stuff due to the length of the books, but some of the changes they made didn't make sense.
Yeah, i have always hated their ending of the 8th movie.  Voldemort just kind of disintegrated.
And i liked harry repairing his wand with the elder wand in the book better than him just breaking it in the movie.
and in the book the portrait of dumbledore in the office was a nice thing to see.  the movie skips that completly
I really wish peeves had been in the movies as well.  he was such a funny character.
Yeah, i was really surprised when they excluded him from the movies.  he played an important part in some of the scenes in the books.
I am really looking forward to the fantastic beasts trilogy.
Me too.  it will be nice to see some of dumbledore's back story.
