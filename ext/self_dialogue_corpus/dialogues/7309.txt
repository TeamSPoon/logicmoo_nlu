Do you ever just think about Disney's classic Cinderella?
Yes, I do actually.
Imagine talking to animals, or thinking that you're talking to animals.
I wouldn't mind having birds and mice that are tame enough to let me dress them up.
That would be adorable, wouldn't it.
I wouldn't want to talk to animals if it meant I had to live with that family through most of my adolescence.
That's true but I supposed at the end of it you end up rich and with someone who wants to take you away from it all.
Even then I don't find it worth it.
You know what's really not worth it, those glass shoes. That would hurt!
No kidding!
