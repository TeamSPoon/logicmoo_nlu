What's one of the weirdest movies you've ever seen?
I would have to say Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas.
Oh yeah!  That's definitely a strange movie.
The one based off the Hunter S. Thompson book.
Well yeah, that's the only one I believe.  When did you see it?
It's been a long time!  I think it was in 1998 when it came out.
Yeah, I saw it in the theatre too.  What a bizarre film.
It was a pretty accurate depiction of the book though, which was also completely bizarre.
Yeah it definitely was.  Who was in it, I've forgotten?
It was Johnny Depp and Benicio Del Toro.
Oh yeah!  Johnny Depp was perfect in that role.
Yeah, he plays quirky characters really well.  I think it's one of his best for sure.
Yeah, no doubt.  Did you ever figure out the plot of the movie?
The plot's a little hard to follow, but in general it's about a journalist and his lawyer who take a trip to Las Vegas.
I thought there was more to it than that.
No, that's pretty much it.  They have a bunch of bizarre escapades while they're there.
Yeah, some scenes stand out in my mind for sure.
Yes, mine too.  Have you read the book?
No, I never did.  Is it good?
I'd say it's better than the movie for sure.
