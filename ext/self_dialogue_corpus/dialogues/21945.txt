Have I ever told you about my favorite movie, True Romance?
No!  I didn't know that was your favorite movie.
It totally is!  I actually own a copy which is rare because I don't usually buy movies.
I don't remember what that one was about.  It was a Tarantino movie, wasn't it?
Well, I don't think he directed it but I think he wrote it.
Yeah, I remember hearing something like that.  Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette, right?
It definitely has one of the Arquettes.  I think it's Patricia.
So what did you like about it so much?
Well I love the romance between Slater and Arquette.  I also love how there are so many different villains all after each other.
Typical Tarantino plot!  Multiple villains in multiple crazy situations.
Yeah it is definitely that.  And the humor is great, as well as the action.
Could I borrow it so that I could watch it again? I know I saw it but it's been so many years I can't remember.
Yes of course you can you just have to bring it back!  I would be so upset if I lost it.
For sure I will!  Whatever happened to Christian Slater anyway?
I think he's still acting.
I haven't seen him in anything lately though.  What has he been in?
Well I know he was in something called the Adderall Diaries a few years ago, but I haven't seen him in much recently.
I wonder what he's up to.
You never know.  Maybe he's just burnt out?
He is getting a little old.  I guess that's possible.
