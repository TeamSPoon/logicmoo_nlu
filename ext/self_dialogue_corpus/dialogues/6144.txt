Which prine do you find most handsome in disney movies?
Well I have always liked prince Eric.
He was cute with his big blue eye's and dark hair.
Totally, also max the dog adds to his appeal.
He is like a classic idea of a prince.
Yes but most disney princes our.
Well not in Beauty and the Beast.
That is a good point. I never think of him in the human form.
He doesn't have much screen time as a human does he.
Also do we ever find out his name? Like is belle going to call him beast forever? wish they would have said it.
