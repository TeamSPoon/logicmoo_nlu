Do you like blues music.
Yes I do.
Do you have any favorite artist.
I love Bb King.
He was the best.
Him and his guitar Lucille.
Man he could pic it.
I think ERIC Clapton is close second.
Clapton is awesome.
Old slow hands himself.
Have you ever seen either one live?
Yes both of them.
I've seen Clapton but not BB.
I saw BB King live at Carnegie Hall.
Wow no kidding.
Yes,back in the early eighties.
The sound had to be phenomenal.
When he did,the thrill is gone,I've never heard it sound so good.
What is your favorite Clapton song.
Probably would be Layla
