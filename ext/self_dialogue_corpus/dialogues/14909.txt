I like movies that make me laugh.
Me too, if I'm in a bad mood I like to watch a funny movie.
What is your favorite movie to watch to get you out of a bad mood?
I think Superbad is one of my favorites.
Yes, that is a hilarious movie.
Jonah Hill and Michael Cera are both really funny in it.
I like the third guy, I can't remember his name.
McDreamy?
Yes, that's the one. His hijinks with the police are so funny.
I could watch that movie over and over again.
