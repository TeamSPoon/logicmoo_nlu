Did you see the movie Takers?
Yep. That was my joint.
Which do you think was better, Takers or Heat?
You mean Heat with Al Pacino and Robert Dinero?
Yeah, that's the one.
I think Heat was better.
Me too. Why you say it was better?
Because it was more realistic. It had me thinking about that bank robbery out there in California some years back.
I know right. Takers seemed a little bit unrealistic.
You must be talking about when they blew the hole in the street?
Exactly. You know dang well ain't nobody blowing up no street in the middle of the day.
I know right. Plus T I was a little creepy dude, little scheming snake.
What you mean?
You ain't going to prison and running your mouth to the Russians and then planning a big heist like that.
I know right. And for him to even be dealing with them, he was selling his boys out.
All because he went to jail and his man took his girl. Dudes always trippin' over a woman.
In Heat, you see the bull Chris had a rider. They went to get him and she secretly let him know that it was a setup.
Now she was a real rider.
But really though, I watch either one of them whenever I see they are on cable.
Me too my dude.
