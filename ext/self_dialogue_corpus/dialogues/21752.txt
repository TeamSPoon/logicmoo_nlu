I hate movies where they force people to interact with a clearly CGI character who isn't there.
What's wrong with that?
I guess nothing when it's done right, but I'm thinking more like those Smurfs movies or the Chipmunks.
Oh, you mean those 'cartoons in real life' type genre. The only one that ever did it well was Space Jam.
Which is funny because Space Jam used actual, 2D cartoons and had them interact with people!
They tried it again in Looney Toons: Back in Action. It's a funnier movie, but I don't think it's as visually impressive.
Actually, come to think of it, the only time humans interacting with CGI characters was back in the early days.
Oh, yeah, like when?
Like Star Wars Episode I and Steward Little. As much as people hated Jar-Jar at the time he looked amazing, like he was really there!
I guess maybe we're so used to seeing CGI characters now, that we just know it isn't really and somehow it looks more fake even though the CGI is better.
To be fair though, even back then there was some bad CGI characters. Like Scooby Doo in the Scooby Doo movie.
Oh, actually, speaking of that, did you know originally that movie was going to be rated R?
What, no way! Impossible!
Seriously, James Gunn who directed the Guardians of the Galaxy films wrote part of the script way back when, and he confirmed it.
I can't picture it. An R rated Scooby Doo movie?
I guess it was supposed to be more of a parody of Scooby Doo than a plain Scooby Doo movie.
Well, what happened to it?
I guess the executives realized it was a dumb idea, so they cut it down to PG-13. Supposedly there's a fully filmed R-rated cut of the film out there somewhere.
Shoot, I don't care how bad the CGI is in it! I just want to see it!
I think everyone would. Too bad no one probably ever will.
