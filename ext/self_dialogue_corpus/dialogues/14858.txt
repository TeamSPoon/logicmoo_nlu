Have you seen any good comedies recently?
I seen the new Kate Mchinon movie, Rough Night.
Was it funny?
It was very funny.
Is that like a romantic comedy?
Not really, it was more like a buddy comedy.
Did it have a lot of jokes?
Lots of slap stick and some nice and raunchy stuff.
It is about the guy getting killed right?
Yeah, but it is really funny. Situational humor.
