What was your favorite battle in the 'Star Wars' universe?
This is a controversial answer, but I loved the final battle in 'Attack of the Clones.'
You're right, it is controversial!  What about it did you like?
I just thought it was so cool seeing that many Jedi together, fighting along each other.  It was the first time anyone saw that.
It was rather large scale.  Definitely unique at that point in time, because other movies showed two Jedi at most.
What was your favorite battle?
I loved the battle on 'Hoth.'
Which one was that?
It was the one on the ice planet.  The scene where Luke destroys the AT-AT was phenomenal.
You're right, that was a cool scene.  I'm changing my answer to that one as well
