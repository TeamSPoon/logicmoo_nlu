That last run for the TD seemed sketchy
Uh, what? Which last run?
The one from the Superbowl.
Oh White's run? yeah His knee seemed down before the ball crossed it seemed
Sketchy
Well, even if it was true that White didn't make it, what were they supposed to do? They had already shot off the confetti, fans were on the field.
Fan are not a reason to not overturn a call.
Well logistically it was impossible. Might as well just give it to them. And Falcons agreed
How do you know?
because if it was that important to them which it was, they would've asked for a challenge
But they didn't so they must have went with it?
Yep. besides, it was a difficult call, there were hardly any angles from which you could see the ball clearly as his knees went down
That sucks that we can send people to the moon, but still haven't figured out a way to view a TD unblocked.
Well, a blocked view is a blocked view regardless of the technology we have. It says nothing of our abilities. We can't physically see through people
Or can we? We do have the x ray technology
Um, yes, bombard our athlete with x rays so we can view the ball, That's the dumbest idea ever
Or is there any other technologies to see through people?
No. infrared will light up the people, but not the ball. X rays will kill peple
What about radar?
No. There is no way. A blocked view is just that. It's blocked.
