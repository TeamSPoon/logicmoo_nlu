What kind of fashion are you into?
I'm into minimalist fashion.
Oh, what's that?
You just own a couple pieces of clothing and make a lot of outfits.
Oh that's cool. How small is your closet then?
It's normal size, just not very full. I have like 5 shirts, 2 pairs of pants, and 2 pairs of shoes.
I could try minimalist for a while, but I really like owning a lot of clothes.
Yeah that's cool. What kind of fashion do you like?
I like avant garde fashion. No rules!
What is the heck is that?
It's like the frontier of something. I like to explore and be adventerous.
So what do you wear?
I try to break norms with my fashion, mismatch and try new things.
What else do you do for that?
I make a lot of my own clothes or alter my old ones.
Like cut them up or sew stuff on them?
Exactly, that's very avant garde!
Who are your favorite designers?
I like Alexander Mcqueen pretty much.
I"ve never heard of him but I'll look him up later!
