What do you think about the 49ers this season?
That's a tough question.     Division-wise, not much.
What makes you say that?
Well, they came in last place in the NFC West last season.
I understand that, but didn't they improve?
Kyle Shanahan and John Lynch know what they are doing, yes.
So how will that knowledge show up?
Well, they will win more than two games!
What is your prediction on wins?
It is early, but 8 wins (a 0.500 season) would be a challenge.
Where would that leave them in the division.
Still last, probably.
Which team do you expect to win?
I think Seattle is a lock.
What about the rest.
The Cardinals and Rams may keep San Francisco in the picture.
That's difficult to hear.
Actually its a good thing, as the 49ers are improving quickly and may have a shot in a couple of years
I guess that is reason for optimism.
True, but there are always the Patriots as most likely AFC opponent.
