What action movies do you recommend me to see this summer?
Personally I'd recommend Wonder Woman.
I'm a bit skeptical when it comes to that movie. I really feel it's over hyped because it's a chick.
Honestly the movie is good, I won't lie to you it does a bit of the whole "girl power" crap but not so much where you get turned off.
So what is the movie about? Origin story or something else?
Yup it's basically just like the comics. Set in world war 2, meets that stranded pilot,etc. You know how the story goes.
So she helps end world war 2?
Yeah, well she basically ends it herself, but the guys help too.
Seriously? If it's overdone just let me know now so I don't waste my time.
No it's very enjoyable. You won't even think about all the girl power junk in it if you are a fan of the comic and character.
