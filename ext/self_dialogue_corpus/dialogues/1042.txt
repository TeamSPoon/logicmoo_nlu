What did you think of the draft for the NFC east teams?
It was interesting what some teams did.
The Cowboys went heavy on the defense.
Yes,they needed help.
I still think they're defense isn't going to be good enough.
They're not too deep.
Going to take a hit losing Damien Wilson too.
That's right he was arrested for domestic violence.
Yes,another cowboy arrested.
How about the Giants picking a tight end.
Yea,I never heard of the guy.
I never did either.
Wasn't it Evan engram from Mississippi?
Yes,he's very athletic from what I read.
Not your typical tight end.
The Cowboys needed help on the edge but went with a run stopper on the defensive line.
Right,taco charlton.
I can hear the nicknames now.
Oh they'll be a lot of Taco Bell references.
Probably be an endorsement.
