What's the best scene in any Star Wars movie?
The best character moment is the dinner scene in Empire.
With Han and Leia on Cloud City?
Yep. Han sees Vader at the table and immediately draws his baster and stars firing.
Haha yeah, pretty good. No preamble, no witty dialogue.
Nope. Just immediately tries to ice the baddest dude in the galaxy.
Like when he shot Greedo under the table in the cantina.
RIght! And that was why the Special Edition was terrible; it changed him to shooting second.
Yeah, it really undermined Han's character.
They didn't need to! We like him *because* he's a scoundrel!
