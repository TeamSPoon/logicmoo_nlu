What's the last band you saw in concert?
Actually I think it was Britney Spears.
I bet that was a great show.  When did you see her?
It was about a year ago in Las Vegas.  It was a really good concert.  She performed a lot of her hits from Circus.
My favorite song from that cd was Womanizer.
Didn't she release that album around the time she went kind of crazy?
I think it was right after that.  She certainly came right back into the spotlight though.  That album had a lot of good singles.
I know. It had Womanizer, Circus, Kill the Lights, If You Seek Amy. It was just a good album all around.
I think it might have been her best one yet.  I liked In the Zone but Circus was really just a little better.
Really you think so?  I loved that song Everytime.  It really showed that she could do ballads and not just pop.
She is very talented there's no doubt.  I'd say she rivals Madonna as the "queen of pop"
But there's so much competition for that title.  Madonna, Kelly Clarkson, and Lady Gaga.
I think Kelly Clarkson has done really well for herself.  She won American Idol back in 2002 and she's not stopped making really good music.
Did you hear that song Piece by Piece.
Yes!  It's so emotional.  I saw a live performance with her singing it on American Idol for the finale and she got tears in her eyes and had to stop singing for a second.
I saw that too.  Keith Urban was just crying and it made me tear up too.
She really is a great artist.  She has a ton of cds but all of them have some good songs on them.
Yeah, not like some artists where their cds are kind of hit or miss.
Did you know she was born in Texas?
I didn't know that.  She really doesn't have an accent though.
