Have you ever listened to Lady Gaga?
Of course, she is one of my favorites. Do you have a favorite song by her?
One of my favorites is Born this way because of the meaning of the song. What is your favorite song?
My favorite is Million Reasons I just like the song for so many reasons. I always have it on repeat.
Did you know she is on tour this year?
Yeah she's doing a world tour I heard it was pretty awesome.
She's always put on a great show she's such a great performer.
I wish I could afford to see her one day.
Her tickets are real expensive but that's because of the venues and cost of her stage props.
I understand that hopefully one day I can go enjoy a show in person.
