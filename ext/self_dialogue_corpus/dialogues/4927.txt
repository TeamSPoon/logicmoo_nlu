So how often do you play baseball here with your friends?
Whenever they can come out.
And how often is that?
Pretty often; only Josiah was out today, though.
What's your favorite baseball team?
The Boston Red Sox.
I thought so; I've seen you wearing a Red Sox shirt sometimes.
It's Josiah's; they're his favorite team, too.
Who's your favorite player on the Red Sox?
Heath Hembree.
Why Heath Hembree?
He's really fun to watch; he's a really good pitcher.
Do you want to play for the Red Sox when you grow up?
I'm not sure; I just like to do it for fun; I know they make a lot of money, though.
Did you watch the game last night?
Yeah, it was fun although they lost. Did you see the whole thing?
No, I saw it the next morning and people were talking about it at work.
I hope the Red Sox will win more games this year.
The season's still young, I think they have a good shot.
I hope so.
