Hey! Are you a fan of Ed Sheeran?
Yeah, I love him! I have all of his albums.
Great! I actually have tickets to see him next Saturday if you want to come with me.
That would be amazing, I would love to come! Do you know who's opening for him?
I know James Blunt is playing too, but I don't know if he's opening. I'd assume so.
I've never heard of him.
He's an English singer-songwriter. He's pretty similar to Ed Sheeran, I would say.
Do you think I would like him?
IF you like Ed Sheeran, then definitely.
Awesome! I can't wait!
