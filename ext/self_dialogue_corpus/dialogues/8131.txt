What was that weird album by Fiona Apple?
Tidal?
No, the really strange album name.
Oh, the super snobby artsy one?
Yeah, that one. The one that didn't succeed.
When the Pawn Hits the Conflicts He Thinks like a King What He Knows Throws the Blows When He Goes to the Fight and He'll Win the Whole Thing 'fore He Enters the Ring There's No Body to Batter When Your Mind Is Your Might so When You Go Solo, You Hold Your Own Hand and Remember That Depth Is the Greatest of Heights and If You Know Where You Stand, Then You Know Where to Land and If You Fall It Won't Matter, Cuz You'll Know That You're Right.
Right, did that succeed at all? That was mean of me.
Spin called it the #100 album of the past 25 years or so. It just didn't get much airplay.
What was the big hit from it?
I think it was Fast as You Can. Hit the top 25.
