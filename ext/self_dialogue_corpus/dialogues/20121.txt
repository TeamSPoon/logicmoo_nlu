Do you have a favorite movie?
I have several favorites and the answer changes with my mood. Do you have a favorite?
I think my current favorite is Sense and Sensibility. Have you seen it?
I think so. Does it have Alan Rickman in it?
Yes, he plays Colonel Brandon.
Oh that's right! I do like that movie.
I think my favorite character is Marianne Dashwood. She is such a romantic.
Yes, I like her character too but there are a lot of great actors in that movie.
Kate Winslet, Hugh Grant, and Alan Rickman are the only ones I can think of. Who else?
Well, Emma Thompson played Marrianne's older sister. What was her character's name?
I think they just called her Miss Dashwood. Who else?
Hugh Laurie was in it too. He was Mrs. Jennings' son in law.
Who was Mrs. Jennings?
She was the lady that took in the Dashwood's after their brother took their inheritance.
Was she the lady who was always trying to get Marianne to tell who her sister was in love with?
Yes, I thought she was so funny!
Who played her character?
Elizabeth Springs is her name but I've never seen her in any other movie.
I'm sure she has done quite a few movies because she is really good.
I bet you're right. Let's look her up and see what other movies she's done.
