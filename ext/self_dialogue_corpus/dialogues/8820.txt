I miss the rock bands of the 90s.
Me too. Which one was your favorite?
I didn't have one particular favorite. They were all so good, you know?
Oh, I know. I especially liked the grunge era.
Same here! I couldn't get enough of Soundgarden, Pearl Jam, and Alice in Chains.
Speaking of Soundgarden, did you hear that Chris Cornell passed away?
Yes, and I'm so sad about it. He was far too young.
Not as young as Kurt Cobain or Layne Staley when they died.
That's true. I guess the bright side is that their music will live on forever.
That's a good way of looking at it.
