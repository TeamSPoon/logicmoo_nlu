What's the first Disney movie you ever saw?
Whoa, that's a hard question! Do you remember what you first saw?
I don't know if it's technically the first movie I saw, but the first one I remember seeing is Bambi.
Oh, that movie is so sad!
I know, especially for a little kid, right!?
It's been awhile since I've seen that movie, but I still remember the line "If you don't have anything nice to say, then don't say anything at all", or something like that.
Thumper, right?
Yup, I think it's what his mom taught him.
A lot of DIsney movies involve talking animals, don't they?
Yeah, I think a lot of them do.
