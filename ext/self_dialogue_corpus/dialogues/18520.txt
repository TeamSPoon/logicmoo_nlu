What is your favorite television theme song? It doesn't have to be an original song.
Well, does the "Breaking Bad" music count? I had warm feelings whenever I heard it.
I liked that too, but that's not really a theme song. What else?
I always like the theme song for "Alice". Are you too young to know the show Alice?
Do you mean "Kiss my grits" show? I'm not that young.
Linda Lavin is an accomplished singer. She was slumming coming to television.
I always loved "WKRP in Cincinnati". Do you know who produced that?
I have no idea. But I also love the music from "Barney Miller". That's good music.
Do you think the writers of those theme songs get royalties for all that use? They'd all be rich.
That would be great. Most likely they were robbed.
So tell me more about television themes past the nineties. Do you have any more recent music you like?
Well I loved the theme song for "True Blood". I bought that and still play it.
That was a winner. I wonder where they found that. Or if it was recorded for the show.
I don't think it was recorded for the show. I think they found and it matched.
I think one of the best is the theme from "Mad Men". It's such a contrast to the time of the show.
Yes. However it works perfectly. Actually all the music on the show was expertly picked.
I can't stand the theme music for "Orange is the New Black". I must mute it.
it has the same affect on me. It's jarring even though it matches the feeling of being in jail.
You're funny. My favorite is the theme song for "The Young and the Restless".
I love it too. That music is haunting and a classic. I think the composer didn't think it was going to on a soap for forty years.
