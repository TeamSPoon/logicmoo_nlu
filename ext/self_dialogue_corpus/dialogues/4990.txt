Will we ever see a hitter hit 400 in a season?
I think the time to do it was the late 90s and it did not happen
Yeah I tend to agree with you because the pitching is so much better
But to counter my own argument, players are hitting alot better than they were.
I just think that its too hard to maintain it all year.
Hard to believe its that big of a deal to hit less than half the time.
Well its a tough game
You would have to go 2 for 3 almost every day because if you go 1 for 3 its still good but not near the 400 level you are aiming for.
I think its harder to hit for the triple crown
Its fun to watch guys get close.
Is there a stat youd like to see eliminated?
I think RBI.
What? Thats how baseball exists!
I just dont see how thats a stat though, you cant control guys getting on ahead of you.
Yeah but you can control whether they cross the dish
Thats true but still doesnt change the fact that you did nothing to get them on.
Sometimes thats not true
How?
Guy could be a terrilbe hitter so they walk players to get to him and then he hits a grand slam
That almost never happens
