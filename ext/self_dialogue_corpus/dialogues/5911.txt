I'm so sad that Robin Williams died.
Yeah, him playing the Genie in Aladdin was a big part of my childhood.
That was the perfect character for him. He was really larger than life.
I still have all the songs memorized.
Should we do an Aladdin movie night.
Sure! I have a copy. I even have the sequels.
There are sequels?
Yeah, a couple of them.
Are they any good?
I mean, not really but they're watchable.
