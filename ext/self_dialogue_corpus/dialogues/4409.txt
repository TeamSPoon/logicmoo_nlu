Have you ever seen Shutter Island?
No I haven't , it looks great.
Yes Shutter Island is a mystery thriller with Leonardo DeCaprio in it.
Who also plays in it?
I think Mark Ruffalo plays in it too.
That one came out in 2010 didn't it?
Yes, but I watched on TNT the other day.
What is the main plot?
Detectives investigate an island asylum for the insane and find not everything is as it seems.
Sounds pretty good, I hope it shows again soon on tv.
