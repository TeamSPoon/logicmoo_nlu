Do you like the Beatles?
Who doesn't like the Beatles? They're the most famous band ever!
yeah. Do you have a favorite song?
I like Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds.
Any reason why?
I like how serene it is and carefree it makes me feel
Do you know what it's about?
I have no idea!
That's funny, I guess a lot of their songs are nonsense
Yeah, but they're happy and catchy!
