Oh I thought it was pretty good, though could have been better.
What did you like about it?
The story of how they came to be with there super powers was very well done each felt impactful and real.
Yeah they did do a great job with the story.
Also the characters personalities were pretty on point with the comics.

Probably The Thing.
Why him?
Well he's this big rock guy but he has sensitive feelings but is not afraid to kick some butt.
