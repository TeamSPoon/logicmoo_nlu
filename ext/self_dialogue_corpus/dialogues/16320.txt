Do you remember that band called Nightwish?
Yeah, i love that band. I stopped listening to them when their singer Tarja left though.
I did too for awhile. I tried to get into the songs of their new singer after Tarja, but Christine could not reach the pitches Tarja did.
My thoughts exactly. did you know the band fired Christine and replaced her with a new singer now?
Oh! I love the new singer, Floor is amazing. She sounds just like Tarja. She has some lungs to carry a tune.
True. I see that Nightwish is actually selling out more concerts and tours these days with Floor as lead.
They are coming to the States sometime next year, I plan to save up enough and buy tickets for myself and my boyfriend.
I would love to go to a Nightwish concert. Has always been my dream sans Christine as lead singer.
Me too. And I always wanted to see Tomas and Marco up on stage doing their thing. Marcos voice drives me insane. I love that guy!
Oh yeah, which reminds me...did they replace the drummer?
You mean Jukka?
That's him, I heard that he was leaving the band awhile back but never got to check out what happened.
No he only left for one tour but he came back after. Someone named Hahto took over for him during that time. But it was only temporary. Hahto was a pretty good drummer just not as epic as Jukka.
I have heard of Hahto then, he is originally from a band called Winter sun. Well, I'm glad Jukka is back and not gone permanently.
That would make me a whole lot of sad if that were so.
In any case, you know what I wish would happen?
What do you wish would happen?
I wish that Tarja and Floor would lead a Nightwish reunion and duet some of their songs together.
Dream on, sister, dream on.
I'll be happy with what Nightwish gives me.
