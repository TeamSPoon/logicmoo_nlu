I watched a really disturbing movie the other night.
What was it called?
It was called We Need to Talk about Kevin.
I haven't heard of that one.  Who is in it?
Tilda Swinton and John C. Reilly.  It came out a few years ago.  I think it's based on a book.
Why was it disturbing?
Well this lady has a baby and she doesn't really connect with him and he's really unruly.  Long story short he grows up and does something really terrible.
That sounds like something I'd like to watch.
It made me want to go hug my son and tell him I love him.
Wasn't Tilda Swinton in that new Marvel movie?
Doctor Strange?  Yeah, she was in that movie.  She hardly seemed like herself though.
I know at first I didn't even know it was her.
I thought that movie was kind of weird.  I think they're planning to make more.
I think they are.  Did you see the scene after the credits?
No, what was it?
He was sitting there with Thor and asking him to leave Earth and then they hinted that Doctor Strange would help Thor.
Out of all the Avengers movies, I liked Thor the least.
Really?  I thought Captain America was not great.
That's true.  He's sort of a stupid superhero.  I mean he has a shield.
The whole thing with him and Bucky was really annoying.
