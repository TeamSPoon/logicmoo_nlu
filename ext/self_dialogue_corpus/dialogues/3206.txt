Did you get season tickets for Titans this year?
No, I was thinking about that, though. I have a good feeling about them this season.
Yeah especially if Mariota comes back healthy.
At least he's not old like some other QB's.
I know some of them are getting up there though.
Right? Like Brady and Palmer...They are gonna need some new QB's.
Arizona has been struggling with getting good QB's it seems like...
Well, they had good ones, Kurt Warner, and Palmer's good, too. Just they seem to get them at the end of their career.
Isn't that the truth! Speaking of getting old, I think their Wide receivers are getting old too.
You mean Fitz? Floyd isn't that old yet, is he?
He's no spring chicken, but got some years left on him. Not sure about Larry' though.
He was slowing down a bit then made like massive comeback last couple of seasons.
Well, back to the Titans, we can share season tickets maybe.
Not a bad idea. I can only make it to about half the games anyway.
Sounds good, I'll check on the prices and such. I'd like to see who's playing here next season.
I'd like to see Raiders or Arizona.
Not Browns? Ha ha! they were horrible last year.
Yeah, to the point it's embarrassing!
I wouldn't mind watching the titans beat the Browns.
It may be a boring game though...
