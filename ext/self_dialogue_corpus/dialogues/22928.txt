If you like '80s movies, you'll love The Breakfast Club.
I've always meant to see that, but haven't gotten around to it.
You've got to see it.  It's set in high school, but all ages should enjoy it.
What happens in the story?
It's about a group of students who have to go to detention on a Saturday.
Does the movie occur in one day?
Yes, it does.
I like movies that are about a short span of time.
Yes, the writing is really great, too.
That's good to know.  That makes a movie for me.
John Hughes movies are usually well-written.
He's a good writer and director.
He certainly is that.
The cast is pretty strong, too, isn't it?
It's a great cast.  They really fit their parts.
Isn't Judd Nelson in the film?
Yes, he's really the best in it in my opinion.
Isn't he the bad boy in it.  That's always the best character.
He's from the wrong side of the tracks, and he's got a lot of problems.
I'm sure I'd find his performance a high point of the movie.
