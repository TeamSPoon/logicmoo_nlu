what is your favorite rock band.
Journey. Hands down best band.
Why did they break up?
I heard it was because the lead singer needed to have surgery and they didn't want to wait for him to heal.
I'm sure there was more to it than that.
There always is.
I think him and Neal Schon had a falling out and they didn't want it made public.
Yes there did seem to be a lot of bad blood there.
I don't think it's cool that they keep trying to replace him.
Yes, he was the voice of Journey.
