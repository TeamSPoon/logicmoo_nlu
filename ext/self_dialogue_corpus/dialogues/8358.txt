Who's your favorite live pop performer?
That's tough, but Lady Gaga always puts on a great show.
Did you see her Super Bowl performance?
Yeah, I thought it was good but not as spectacular as I expected.
Me too. What is your favorite halftime performance of recently?
I think Beyonce's was probably the best. I still remember it and it was years ago.
And they brought her back for last year's too didn't they?
With Bruno Mars and Coldplay? Yes, they did.
Beyonce is a once in a generation performer, though.
Her vocals live are exactly like the record. She's so talented.
