What do you think about the new Foo fighters song?
It was just ok, I was hoping for somthing better.
It was a little slow to start, but overall I really liked it.
It just wasnt foo fighters normal stuff. It wasnt as upbeat as I would have hoped.
really? It did start slow but it picked up pretty great.
I wonder if the whole album will be the same?
Kind of like when linkin park completely changed.
exactly how they changed. Its like it wasnt even the same band.
That was pretty disappointing. I dont see that happening with Foo fighters.
I would hope not, I cant wait to listen to the rest of the ablum.
You think Dave Grohl would be who hs is now without nirvana?
oh wow Im not sure, Nirvana was really the big stepping stone that he needed to be successful.
Dave Grohl is great, did you see him in the Pick of Destiny?
That was a funny movie, Dave Grohl can do no wrong.
You should give Run another chance, im listening to it now and its really great. Classic Foo
Maybe I will, they are one of my favorite bands of all time.
Their catalog is pretty great, Echoes, silence, patience & grace was the best one in my opinion
That was the one with the Pretender? that was a good album
It really was, The colour and the shape was great too. have you heard of that one?
Of course I have! 1997 classic Foo fighters is the best.
