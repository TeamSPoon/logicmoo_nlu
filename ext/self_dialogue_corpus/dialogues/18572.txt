Do you like U2?
Sure. Well some of their stuff is good, some is so-so.
What's your favorite album?
I have to say The Joshua Tree. That's a classic.
Yeah, I like that. But Achtung Baby is my favorite.
Yeah? What song do you like?
"One" is great. Just classic.
OK, it was good, but overplayed. I prefer Who's Gonna Ride Your Wild Horses.
Yeah, that's good too. That album is full of great songs.
For sure. I love Acrobat, too.
Yeah, that's an underrated gem, I think.
But do you like Rattle and Hum.
I liked it when it came out, but I got sick of it after a while.
Same here. What about the latest album?
It's OK I guess. It just sounds pleasant but forgettable.
Maybe we're just too old and jaded.
Nah man, it's Bono who's old.
You make a good point. I do like their early albums better.
Yeah, the Unforgettable Fire is a good one too.
Yes, we're just nostalgic old geezers, aren't we?
