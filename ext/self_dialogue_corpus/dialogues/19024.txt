Did you hear that Beyonce had her twins?
Wow, everybody is having twins these days.
Well, you know, babies are a very popular accessory this season.
That seems a little harsh.
Anyways, back to Beyonce.  Do you like her music?
I'm kind of crazy in that I like her Destiny's child stuff.
You are a minority.
Yes.  I like mindless pop music.
Why?
I don't want to have to censor my music when I'm around the kids.  I don't want them to hear cursing and hypersexualized things.
I think they get a lot it already in music that they already hear.
Do you know anything else about Beyonce's twins?
No, I think everything is hush hush right now.
What do you think they will name them?
Who knows.  Anything goes these days.
Well the Clooneys had twins and they chose very traditional names.
Well Amal is British.
Beyonce lost her bid to trademark Blue Ivy's name.
Is that weird that she's trying to trademark it?
I guess she's just trying to protect her.
