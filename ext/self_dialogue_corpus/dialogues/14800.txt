Hey, glad I caught you! I heard there are going to be some Marx Brothers movies on tonight. They're hilarious!
I really don't like the Marx Brothers.
What do you mean  you don't like the Marx Brothers? Everybody likes the Marx Brothers!
I guess I'm the exception that proves the rule!
What don't you like about them?
I just don't really care for all that slapstick comedy. Not my thing.
But they're so funny when they do stuff like that!
I know lots of people like physical comedy, but I don't.
Well, I love that kind of stuff, pies in the face and all that.
Then I'm sure you're going to enjoy the movies tonight. Have fun!
