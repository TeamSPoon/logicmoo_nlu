So what do you think about rap music today?
I think the lyrical content isn't the same.
I agree it's not like the early 90s.
However, the beats are much better.
Yes the drum machines back than were quite simple.
I hate how the lyrical content is not so much poetry.
Yes it seems to be alot about money and women.
I am sure there are artists that are Underground who change that.
Definitely I know a female MC named Jean Grae.
She is amazing, I've heard of her.
I also like the return of Remy Ma.
Yes Remy Ma is great.
What about when it comes to old school?
I love Nas, and Tupac.
I love a Tribe Called Quest a lot.
Wow that is really bringing it back early.
I also love Method Man and the Wu tang clan.
One of my other favorite artists include the Fugees.
Yes, what about artists today?
One that has great beats and okay pop catchy lyrics is FloRida.
