Have you ever seen a movie called The Thing with Kurt Russell?
Yes I have and incredibly I didn't see it for the first time until 2 years ago.
Really?! It's a classic, one of the best horror movies ever.
I know that's why I'm surprised I hadn't seen it before then.
Kurt Russell was good in that. I also loved him in Overboard and Big Trouble in Little China.
Classic 80s flicks. That was the best time for movies.
I know. They were innocent but at the same time not.
Kurt Russell came back after a while when Tarantino put him in Death Proof.
Oh yeah I saw that. It was definitely classic Tarantino style.
Right and now that I'm thinking of Goldie Hawn, I just saw her in Snatched.
Oh right, the one where her and her daughter get kidnapped on vacation.
Yes that was hilarious. There's a tapeworm scene in there that made me squirm all over the place.
Oh yuck! Yes I could barely handle that. I had to cover my eyes and look away from the screen.
There's a movie called How to be a Latin Lover that I think is going to be funny.
I haven't seen a trailer for that one. Have you seen the new Alien yet, Alien Covenant?
No I haven't seen it but I heard the reviews were bad.
I heard that too but I don't like listening to reviews. I don't always like what the mainstream does.
Right. And Prometheus was great, that was the prequel for the Alien franchise.
Yeah that's a great example. They trashed that one but I absolutely love it.
I love sc-fi movies in general. The Fourth Kind is one of my favorites.
