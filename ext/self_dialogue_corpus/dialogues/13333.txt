Episode 7 was the Han movie.
Right. And Episode 8 should be the Luke movie.
Episode 9 was supposed to be the Leia movie.
Such a bummer Carrie Fisher won't be around for it.
I know. But it's better not at all than CGI like on Rogue One.
I thought she looked fine in that.
She did, but it wasn't just her. It was another actress with her face.
She looked better than Tarkin did.
I appreciated that they were tying the film to Episode IV. Tarkin was a mistake though.
The technology isn't there yet.
