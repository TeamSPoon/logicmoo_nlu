Do you ever think a no. 16 seed will beat a no. 1 seed in the tournament?
No, of course not.
Why is that?
I'm totally on board for the no. 1 seed to lose to an 8/9 in the second round, but there is too much discrepancy.
Everyone keeps getting better, though.
Yeah, but the rich keep getting richer. And the committee makes it nearly impossible for the small guys to win.
It's even more apparent in the women's tournament.
How so?
Well, in the mens, there are usually 8-10 teams who could realistically win the whole thing.
And in the womens?
It'll be UConn, Stanford, Notre Dame, or South Carolina.
Every year?
Close enough. Since 2000, UConn has won 10 champsionships.
Who else has won it all?
South Carolina this year, Baylor, Texas A&M, Maryland, Tennessee, and Notre Dame.
So 7 different champions in 17 years, that's not good.
No, it's not. They're all top seeds, too.
How's that compare to the men?
Lots of top seeds, but more variety: UNC, Villanova, Duke, UConn, Louisville, Kentucky, Kansas, Florida, Syracuse, Maryland, Michigan State.
And, lower seeds, too. Got it.
