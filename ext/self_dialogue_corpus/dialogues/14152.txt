Would you go to see lady Gaga live?
Absolutely I would.
Based on her SUPERBOWL performance it would be some show.
Isn't that the truth.
How about starting the show with god bless America.
No one saw that coming.
Then swinging down from the roof the stadium was incredible.
I couldn't believe what I was watching
Then to sing this land is your land continued to amaze me
She surprised a lot of people
