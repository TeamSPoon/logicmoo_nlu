It's funny how I never believed Episode III was the last Star Wars film.
Too much money to be made.
Too much merchandise to sell.
George Lucas was  a genius to make as much off of that as he did.
It's his fault, though, that we get all these films trying to copy the Star Wars formula now..
Oh yeah, I mean now every movie has to be a blockbuster.
That's why Disney bought  Star Wars though. They wanted to make a ton of money.
I just feel like they should have left the original three movies alone.
I wish they left Han alive instead of wasting his death on Kylo.
I do too.
