Would you rather go to a movie at the theater or rent a movie and watch it at home?
Nowadays, I prefer to rent a movie and watch it at home.
Why is that?
Well, for one, I can skip the twenty minutes of previews and insane ticket prices.
Those are good reasons, but what are your others?
I have a clearplay dvd player at home and it will filter out all the raunchy stuff, making it a much better experience.
Oh, aren't movies just crammed full of sexuality these days?
Yes and I'm continuously confused as to why the movie makers feel they must include sex scenes.
You would think they would figure out that they are cutting out a huge portion of their audience by including stuff like that.
Yes, it is disappointing that the industry leaders have not figured that out.
I know that my husband is recovering from a sexual addiction and he has flat out told me he can't watch most of the movies out these days.
And then there's the language that I hate my teenagers hearing and becoming desensitized to.
I know, it's almost like our culture wants to force us to become cursing, violent sex addicts.
Thank goodness for the few who do create movies that are wholesome.
Yes, but they tend to be pretty cheesy.
That's true, but they definitely have gotten better.
Yeah, like Facing the Giants?
That was a great one, and so was Friday Night Lights.
Oh I love that one and love Jim Caviezel.
He is a superb actor.
