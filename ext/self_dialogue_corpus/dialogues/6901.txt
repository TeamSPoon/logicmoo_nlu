I feel like some of the Disney movies lately are hit or miss. What about you?
I feel like they are as well.
What are some of your favorite Disney movies? I prefer Tangled and Big Hero 6 as well as Wreck-It Ralph over Frozen.
I would have to say those are my favorite as well. Frozen was just too generic.
Did you enjoy the live action Beauty and The Beast Disney movie?
I liked it but I felt like there were some aspects that were better in the animated version of Beauty and The Beast.
What about Disney's Cinderella Live Action?
That one was alright. Cinderella was never my favorite fairy tale though.
I found the Malificent movie though to be a bit refreshing.
I did enjoy that movie a lot although it would be nice to see Maleficent get a romantic true love.
