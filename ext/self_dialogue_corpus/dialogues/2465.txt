Do you know when the football season starts?
I think it's in the beginning of September.
I can't wait. It's been too long! I think I'll go and see them at training.
Who?
Cardinals. They train in Flagstaff.
It will be nice to get out of the heat and watch them practice.
I want to get some autographs too. Especially from David Johnson.
He is the new Running back, right?
Yeah, he is an awesome player! He's fast and smart player, too.
It's good that they have a good offensive players.
Now we will have to start looking for a quarterback and wide receivers, too, though.
I guess you are right. I'm thinking Palmer and Fitz will play another season or two at the most...
My thoughts exactly!
We'll see how they do at draft.
Ugh, I get so intense watching the draft...it's nerve wrecking...
Don't worry, Cards is a great team.
I know and I love the way they play. Not dirty like some other team...
Yeah, I really like Bruce Arian, too. He is a great coach.
Let's hope we beat the Seahawks!
Oh, I know! I hope so, too.
