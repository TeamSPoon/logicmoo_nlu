I plan on watching the Star Wars films for the first time this weekend. Which movie should I start with?
Wow, you're probably the only person I know that hasn't seen Star Wars before.
My co-workers tease me about that all the time. I must be the only person in the world that still hasn't seen those movies.
Since you're new to the series, you might want to start out with Episode I: The Phantom Menace.
Wait. Someone else told me that I should watch episode IV first. The one from the 70s.
Don't listen to that guy. Trust me, you're better off watching the prequels first.
So, that's Episodes I, II, and III, right?
Yeah. Then you should watch the original trilogy in order.
Gotcha. But when should I squeeze in Rogue One?
Whenever. It's a side story, so it doesn't matter when you watch it.
