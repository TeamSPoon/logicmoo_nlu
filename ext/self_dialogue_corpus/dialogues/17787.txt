This new Chevelle album is really rocking out.
I've never really gotten into Chevelle...
Why not if you don't mind me asking, you like the Deftones?
I don't know, they sound like Tool wannabes to me
Well, they are a Tool tribute band, so that's sort of the point?
Really? I didn't know that!
Ok, check out some of the earlier tracks like "Comfortable Liar"
I'm looking it up...I do like their track "Here Come the Gunmen"
That's a classic on of theirs up there with "Hats off to the Bull"
That one I'm not so into, I like the Red ok, but that's about it.
Are you listening to "Comfortable Liar" yet?
Yes, I pulled it up on Youtube...stupid ads...
Ok, well this is more the flavor of what they do in Omen, their new album.
I can see tracks, but not albums, what's their best ones?
Ok, well the good ones here for me are "Warhol's Showbiz" and "Door to Door Cannibals"
This song is awesome!
Which one? The ones I was just talking about or Comfortable Liar?
Comfortable Liar, it has great guitar parts and drive.
Oh yes, but the best one is Joyride, just don't drive to that one or you will get pulled over.
This is really cool, I'm gonna give Chevelle another shot.
