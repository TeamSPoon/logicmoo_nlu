Ever heard of the movie Alpha Dog?
I believe so, who is in it?
Justin Timberlake is one of the actors.
Oh wait, is that the movie about the kid who was kidnapped?
Yes! It is based on a true story.
I think I have seen a few parts of it, it looked really good.
It is, you must watch the whole thing, especially the ending.
Isn't Bruce Willis in that movie as well?
Yes, he plays the father of the head drug dealer that stole the kid.
And Sharon Stone too right?
Yes, she is the mother of the kid that is kidnapped.
I have heard a lot about it, but have never seen it all the way through.
You must watch it all the way through, it is such a great movie.
Is it sad?
Well, I can't say much more without really giving away what happens.
From what I saw, the kidnappers are young themselves.
Yes, they kidnap the kid because the kids' older brother owes a drug dealer money and they hold him as ransom.
And this is based on a true story?
Yes it is, that is what makes it sad.
Cone watch it with me, I am going to go rent it now.
