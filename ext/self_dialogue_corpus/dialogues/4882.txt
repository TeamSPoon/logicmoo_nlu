Will any pitcher come near Nolan Ryan's record for no hitters?
No way its untouchable.
We have seen an uptick in No Hitters lately.
But those are just isolated starts. Guys dont come near them.
Yeah I think its tough to throw them nowadays
Plus guys are singles hitters now
So you think the hitters have evolved?
Its just that theres more contact going on in baseball
But the power numbers are down.
Yeah and if pitchers dealt with that it means more flyouts.
So no one will break this record?
No, not in my mind. Just like DiMaggio's record.
It is amazing that no one has even come close to it.
Yeah its just too hard as well.
we are in a pitching era right now.
And that will end eventually because everything is cyclical
I think that we will see it turn quicker but who knows.
It goes without saying in my opinion
Its such a great sport with so many records.
But you do want to see them get broken
