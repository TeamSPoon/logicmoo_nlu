Have you heard Andy Black's new album?
No, wasn't he in a band?
Yeah he's in Black Veil Brides but made a solo album.
Is it the same type of music as Black Veil Brides?
No, his solo album is more alt-pop.
Is it any good?
Yeah, it's pretty good. He collaborated with a lot of different artists like Gerard Way and Patrick Stump.
Sounds interesting. Is Black Veil Brides breaking up?
No, they are just taking a break. He wanted to try a different sound.
I really like his voice. His new album must be good.
Yeah, it has a lot of catchy tunes and cool songs.
Do you know if he's going to be touring?
I know he's doing the Vans Warped Tour.
Have you seen him in concert?
I haven't seen him perform solo but I did go to a Black Veil Brides concert once.
I did too and it was awesome.
Some of his fans from Black Veil Brides think he's a sellout for going pop, but the majority really like it.
Yeah the band has changed a lot since they first started. They don't wear makeup anymore or have crazy hair.
Yeah Andy said they have evolved and that's why his new solo album has a different sound.
I'm going to download his new album.
