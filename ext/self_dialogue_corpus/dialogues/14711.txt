Hey! Do you like basketball?
Yeah, I'm a huge fan of the NCAA!
Nice, me too! I prefer the ACC bracket.
Oh, I bet you're a Duke fan.
Definitely not! I'm a Tarheel basketball fan through and through.
I bet you were happy with the March Madness winner this year then!
Oh yes! That game was ugly though.
Yeah, both teams were pretty sloppy.
Justin Jackson didn't hit a single three, and that really hurt us.
And then their big guy fouled out, so that helped you guys a lot.
Well, our big guy had hurt both ankles, so the way he played was really impressive.
He won best player for the tournament, didn't he?
Yeah, Berry had 22 points in the final.
And he made some kind of steal at the end, right?
Yep! He made the big steal at the end that got the ball to Jackson.
The game was pretty much over at that point.
I was so excited, they'd worked really hard.
You gotta feel bad for Gonzaga, though.
For sure, that team played really hard.
Their coach is really a stand up guy too.
