Were the Cleveland Indians once an NFL team?
Yes, there were several teams with that name in the early days of the NFL.
How did that come to be?
The baseball team named the Cleveland Indians started in 1915. The football team wanted to keep the tradition alive.
So, they named their football team similarly?
Yes, but that's not the only reason.
Why else?
Many early professional football players were Native Americans.
Why was that?
I'm not sure. But, it probably relates to the fact that Jim Thorpe was from the Sac and Fox Nation.
Wow, that's interesting!
Yes, and at one point, Thorpe had an NFL team comprised entirely of Native Americans.
What team was that?
They were called the Oorang Indians.
Where were they based?
It was in LaRue, Ohio.
Where's that?
It's near Marion, Ohio. Marion is in between Toledo and Cleveland.
I never heard of it!
Yes, it's the smallest town to ever have an NFL franchise.
