Hey have you seen the movie Hell or High Water?
No, is it new?
Yeah, I think it just came out!  It was awesome!
Oh wow, what is it about?
It's about these two brothers who are bank robbers.  They keep committing different heists to try to save their family farm.
That sounds interesting.  I love a good bank robber movie!
Yeah, the suspense is great.  Plus the scenery in the movie is beautiful.
Is it set in modern times, or is it in the olden days?
No it's modern.  I think it's somewhere down in Texas or something.
Sounds great, who's in it?
I can't ever remember the names of actors but you would probably recognize them.
So what ends up happening, can you tell me?
No, you will have to watch it!  I promise you will enjoy it though.
I'm always looking for a good movie.  We watched Desperado the other night, do you remember that one?
The Tarantino movie?
Yeah!  It's old but still a great movie.
Of course I remember that movie!  It was my favorite Tarantino movie.
Yeah, well my husband had never seen it.  I love Antonio Banderas.
Oh yeah, he's great in everything.
You should re-watch that one when you get a chance.
