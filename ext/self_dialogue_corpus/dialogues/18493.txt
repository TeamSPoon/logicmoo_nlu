Let's play a game.
What kind of game?
I'll name a song and you tell me if you know the singer.
Okay, go ahead.
"Falling", that's the name of the first song.
I'll have to think a second, hold on.
Okay let me know if you figure it out.
Would it be Alesso?
Yes you are correct! Good guess. Wow.
Okay my turn, I need to think of a song.
Anything will be fine, I know a lot of music.
"Must Be Nice" is the song.
Can you give me a clue?
It's a male singer, he's an R&B artist.
Okay I should know this.
Do you give up?
No no I can guess. Wait, is it Lyfe?
You got it! Great job.
Thanks. I try to learn a wide variety of music.
Me too, I think it helps me to be well rounded.
