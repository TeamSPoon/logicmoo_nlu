Have you see any good comedies lately?
Not in the theatre. I did watch Major League on the television the other night.
That was a funny movie.
Yes it was. I like all the baseball players.
Charlie Sheen was so young in that.
Yes he was. He looked funny in those black glasses.
It was kind of funny that they would play Wild Thing when he walked out when he looked like a dork.
It was. I liked Jake Taylor.
Who played him?
That was Tom Berenger.
Okay, I thought so.
Not a big fan of Rene Russo.
You mean her character or any of her movies?
Any of her movies. She sort of plays the same kind of woman in them all.
She actaully does, now that you mention it.
Even in serious movies. She's just not a likeable character.
I agree.
Corben Bernsen is good as an actor.
Yes, he is. Did he start on a televison show?
I think L.A. Law.
