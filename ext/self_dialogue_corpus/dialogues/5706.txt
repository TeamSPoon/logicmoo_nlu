My favorite Avenger is Captain America!
Why?
He's awesome! He's all about freedom, and fighting Nazis, and his shield is really cool!
I like Iron Man. Tony Stark can be a bit rough around the edges, but he's got brains! He fights with what he makes himself!
He kind of took the wrong side during Civil War.
He had a point, though, it's easy to go too far. When you fight monsters, you have to make sure you don't become a monster too.
That's true, but who decides what's right? The Government? If the law says you have to hurt some people and you know it's wrong, you have to go against the law to do what's right.
That's a good point.
That's why Captain America fought against Iron Man. Tony was going overboard to protect everyone because he was scared and it was compromising everyone's freedom. Plus, Hydra had taken over SHIELD.
Man, Marvel's pretty deep.
