What movie would you recommend to watch tonight?
My Mom's a Werewolf
What is that about?
A lady who gets bitten by a werewolf and then turns into a werewolf.
So, the basic storyline?
Yes, but there are tons of other things going on. She has a daughter who starts figuring out what's going on.
Who is the main character?
Tina Caspary. She is not in much else, but she is amazing in this movie.
Is it a well known film?
Not at all. It would probably be called a B movie.
I love those kinds of movies.
Me too. Have you ever seen They Live?
No is it good?
Yes. John Carpenter directed it and it's amazing.
I am a big fan of John Carpenter. I love Halloween (1978)
Yeah, Jamie Lee Curtis was great in that.
Did you know her mom was in Psycho?
Really? Wow, that is awesome.
Yes and her dad is Tony Curtis from Some LIke it Hot (1958)
You know a lot about movies.
