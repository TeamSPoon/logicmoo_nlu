What is the last pop song you've heard?
I think it was a The Weeknd song called, "I Feel it Coming".
Oh, really? I'm not sure I've heard that one.
Yeah, I just so happened to see a bit of the music video the other day.
Is it good?
Oh, it's alright. It sounds like every other pop song. He tries too hard to sound like Michael Jackson.
Oh, I think I know who you're talking about now. The guy with the wacky hair?
Yeah, that's him. All his songs sound pretty much the same. So, if you've heard one, you've heard them all.
Well, I guess I won't be checking that song out.
I wouldn't bother. It's not unpleasant like some songs on the radio. It's mediocre.
