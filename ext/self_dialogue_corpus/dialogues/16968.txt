What is your favorite 80's band?
I don't know. I went through so many that were my favorites.
I know. When I was younger I liked Sting for a while.
Yes I thought he was cute as well.
I loved the Dream of the Blue Turtles album.
I loved the cover of it myself.
Some of the songs I liked but didn't really get the meaning of them at the time.
Yes, he is pretty deep.
Like the one about the Russians.
Oh yes, with the lyrics :I hope they love their children too.
Yes. I didn't really hear the lyrics when I heard the music.
Same here. I kind of just listened to the music itself.
The lyrics almost seemed an after thought.
Yep. You could just sing them without really taking in their meaning.
I liked that he incorporated jazz style music in the album.
And I loved the back up singers style of singing.
What was your favorite song on the album?
Probably the first one he released which was Fortress Around Your Heart.
Oh yes, that is one of the songs where I loved the melody, but didn't get the lyrics at the time.
Ha ha yes. Totally agree.
