Do you want to go to the movies this weekend?
Sure, what are we going to see?
I am not sure, lets look and see whats playing?
lets look for action...Oh "Transformers: The Last Knight" is playing
ok, if you want action, that is the right choice
I hear optimus prime is the bad guy in this
no way, how does that happen I wonder
I dont know, we will see this weekend
I cant wait
me either, I love a good action film
