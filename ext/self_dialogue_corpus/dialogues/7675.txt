The Harry Potter books are some of my favorites, though I really like the movies as well.
You didn't think they deviated too much from the source material?
No, not at all!
Well, they did change a few things.
Yeah, but that's going to happen with any screen adaptation. I think they stayed very true to the story's overall theme.
You mean love triumphing over hate and all that?
Yeah, that was really the most important part, you know?
I can see that. I just wish a few of the scenes hadn't been cut out.
True, but you never know. They might be released on extended editions someday.
I hope so!
