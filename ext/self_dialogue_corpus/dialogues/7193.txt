Wasn't Tom Hanks in Toy Story?
I think so, was that the movie with the cowboy and the space explorer?
Yeah! They were toys that came to life at night. I think Tom Hanks was the voice of the cowboy.
You're right, and Tim Allen was the voice of the space explorer, Buzz Lightyear!
I remember watching that show as a kid and being so afraid of the neighbor boy, Sid.
He was such a bad kid!
I was so scared when the toys were stuck at Sid's house, but the best part was when they escaped.
With the help of the other toys! The barbie doll legs with the hook head and the baby that had spider legs.
They seemed scary at first but were actually good!
I know! Those toys just had bad luck being with Sid.
