I finally saw Wonder Woman this weekend.
What did you think?
I loved it. Gal gadot did a really good job portraying Wonder Woman.
I liked Chris Pine's character. He brought some good humor to the film.
I was reading where Wonder Woman is breaking a lot of box office records.
It holds the record for being the biggest grossing action movie directed by a female.
I think it's good that there was finally a female superhero movie.
I think there have been a couple in the past, like Catwoman, but they didn't do well at the box office.
I think it helped that her character was introduced in Batman vs Superman.
I agree. I think a lot of Batman and Superman fans watched Wonder Woman because of that.
Do you think there will be a sequel?
Probably. Look how many superhero movies get sequels.
True. The newest Spiderman movie is coming out soon.
Thor also has a sequel that will be out
It's called Thor Ragnarok and it's coming out in November.
Are you planning to see it?
Most likely. I usually see most of the superhero movies.
So do I. I'm looking forward to Justice League.
So am I. We should see it together.
Sounds like a plan.
