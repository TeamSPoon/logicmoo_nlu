James Bond, yes or no?
Hmm...I'd say maybe
I liked the original ones, not so much the new ones
Really?! I prefer the new ones with Daniel Craig
I don't know, kind of too serious for me. I liked Roger Moore.
Roger Moore! Those were way too corny
Well I liked the tongue in check humor
But they were so unbelievable!
Um, aren't all James Bond movies unbelievable
Good point.
