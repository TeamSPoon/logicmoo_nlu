I haven't seen any movies in ages.
Yeah. I think it's been a few years since I actually went and watched a movie in a theatre.
Do you watch DVDs at all?
I do. I watch DVDs and watch movies online.
Have you seen any good ones lately?
I've actually just been watching older movies you've probably seen. I recently watched Along Came Polly.
That movie was hilarious.
Ben Stiller and the guy who played Sandy were hilarious in that.
That was Phillip Seymour Hoffman.
He was hilarious. There's a lot of good physical comedy in that movie.
There is, such as the basketball scene.
There's also that scene where Ben Stiller's character is using the bathroom in the girl's apartment.
I almost died during that scene!
One of the guys who does a Simpsons voice was in that.
Which guy?
Hank Azaria.
Who did he play?
He played that guy on the beach with the accent. This was in the beginning before Ben Stiller's character gets divorced.
"Are you for scuba?" Are you talking about that guy?
Exactly. That's him.
