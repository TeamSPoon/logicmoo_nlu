Have you seen Rogue One?
Yeah, it was awesome.
I think it may have been in my top 3 favorite Star Wars movies.
Me too!
It fills in one of the biggest plot holes of the series.
Oh yeah?  And what is the biggest plot hole?
That you would build the ultimate space station, capable of easily destroying a planet that can be blown up so easily.
You know, I never thought about that but its true.
It just doesn't make sense.
You're right, man.
