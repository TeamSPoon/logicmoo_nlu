What kind of movies do you like?
I like horror movies or thrillers.
Me too!  What is your favorite movie?
I like the old Nightmare on Elm Streets.
Me too! There is something about those older movies that nobody can seem to recreate.
I agree.  I know they redid Nightmare on Elm Street and spin offs like Freddy vs. Jason, but they just aren't the same.
I know.  You can't beat the originals.  Halloween is another good one.
Oh, I love that one.  I like how when the did revamp it, they still included Jamie Lee Curtis.
That was pretty cool.
I don't mind the newer remakes of the movies, but they will never be as good as the originals.
What original horror movie would you want to recreate?
I think it would be cool to redo Friday the Thirteenth.
Oh it would be!  I loved those movies when I was a kid.  Who would you cast as Jason?
That's a good question....I'm not really sure.
That would be tough to cast that role.  Do you like comedies?
I do. I love anything with Will Ferrell.  He's a riot!
I like him in Step Brothers.
I really like Zach Effron and The Rock too.  They're so funny together.
Yeah they are!  I can't wait to see them in Baywatch.
Yeah...that should be coming out soon.  I'm not missing that one!
