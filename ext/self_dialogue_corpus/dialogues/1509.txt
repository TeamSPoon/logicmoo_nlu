What do you think about this year's NFL Draft?
I didn't watch a lot of it. It takes way too long.
I mean the picks.
Well, the first pick wasn't surprising. I expected Myles Garrett to go first.
From what I read, I think he did too!
I think you are right. The most surprising to me was that Mitchell Trubisky ended up going second.
That seems like a big risk for the Bears.
I think so. But clearly they saw something in him!
What do you think about Jabrill Peppers?
Personally, I recognize he is an amazing athlete, but I think he's overrated.
Really? He can play all sides of the ball.
Which may be great in college, but will that work for the NFL?
I don't know. I guess the Browns will find out.
The Browns need all the help they can get!
They've been so bad the last few years. How many picks did they have this year in the first round?
I think they ended up with three first round picks.
Their quarterback situation is still such an unknown.
That is the truth! They have Osweiler who himself is a big question mark.
I know and I don't know that their backups will offer much.
Well, I don't even think they know who their backups are yet. They haven't picked a starter.
