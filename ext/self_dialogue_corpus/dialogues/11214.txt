Which designer designs the best handbags?
It is hard to say. I like so many of them.
Yeah, so do I. I really like all of Dooney & Bourkes hand bags.
So do I but Anuschka's hand painted leather bags are so unique.
Aren't they? I have never seen anything so stunning.
The pretty one with the pink flamingos. I really need that bag.
But the white, square shaped one with the butterflies and the short handle.
Yeah, the one with roses.
Exactly. The purple and pink roses.
That handbag is killer.
The Givenchy Antigona Bag with leopard print and beige handles is nice.
The one Jada Pinkett Smith owns? I know exactly which one you are talking about.
That bag is expensive and the plus it too box like to me.
You want to talk expensive. The Fendi Petite 2Jours is expensive and box like.
I know it. It looks like you are carrying  a small box.
Most of Fendi Petite 2Jours look like boxes on your arms.
Now, they have some cute colors.
True. But I refuse to pay that kind of money for what looks like a small box hanging from a strap.
Yeah. Tell me about it. Although the owl looking ones so gorgeous.
I know. I especially like the one with the pink beak.
