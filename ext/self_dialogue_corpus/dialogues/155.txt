What are your thoughts on the Spiderman relaunch?
I hated the Amazing Spiderman.
Me too.  But the new one looks good.
Oh, you mean Iron Man 4?
Ha ha.  Hey, I like Robert Downey, Jr.
It looks OK but I am super done with Spiderman.
I agree with you.  I think I'd like more movies about other people.
But TV does superheros so much better.
Yes, it does.  I am not looking forward to the movie of the Flash.
Eh. Yeah, no.
