Who is your favorite singer ever?
I am a big Elvis Presley fan.
What is your favorite song of his?
There are many, but I love "That's All Right Mama".
Wasn't that his first single?
Yes it was.
Do you like any other singers from that era?
I love Jerry Lee Lewis too.
What do you like about him?
I love his piano playing.
I also love his energy!
Yes, he is one of a kind.
He is still touring I hear.
We should catch a show next time he's in town!
I heard he is Jimmy Swaggart's cousin.
He is also Mickey Gilley's cousin.
That's three great pianists from that family.
I would say so.
I heard he married his own cousin too.
That's a bit weird.
