Did you see the new Jungle Book movie?
The live action one, you mean?
Yeah, the new one that came out recently.
No, I haven't watched it.
I saw it yesterday. It was really cool!
Honestly, I was deliberately avoiding it.
Why would you do that?
Well, the original Disney Jungle Book animated movie was one of my childhood favorites.
Mine too! But that made me want to see it more.
It works the opposite for me. It make me worried that the new one could never live up to the original.
Ah, I see where you're coming from.
Yeah, it just seemed like if it can't live up to the first one, I'm just going to be disappointed.
I don't think you would be, though. The visual effects were stunning.
Maybe, but give me the good old animation, and I'll be happy.
You can't imagine how cool and dynamic all the animals were.
I'm sure that's the case, but it still wouldn't be the same.
I guess I can't really convince you that you're wrong, but I think you're making a mistake not seeing it.
Possibly, but I'll survive!
Haha, I guess so. Just in a slightly less Jungly world.
Maybe I'll go watch the original movie again!
