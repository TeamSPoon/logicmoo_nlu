Hey, what's the best movie you've seen lately?
Gosh, that's a hard choice!  I watched a good kids movie recently.
What was it?
Barbie: The Princess and the Popstar.  It was actually really good.
Are you serious? It sounds corny.
I know, I know, but it wound up having a good story.  The songs were great, too.
I guess a lot of those Barbie movies are pretty well done.
Yeah, they are.  The graphics are good and the storylines are usually pretty interesting.
My older daughter watches a lot of them.
Yeah, I watch them with my daughter.  There's another called Barbie In the Pink Shoes that's good.
What's that one about?
It's about ballet and dancing.  It has some really funny parts.
I saw one about Mermaids? It think it was called a Mermaid Story?
Barbie and a Mermaid Tale.
Yes, that's the one.  It was pretty good too.
Yeah, it had the surfer girl.  I liked it allright but I think the Princess and Popstar one was the best.
Well maybe I will check it out.  What was it about?
It's kinda like the Prince and the Pauper.
Oh, so it's a remake of the old story?
Something like that.
