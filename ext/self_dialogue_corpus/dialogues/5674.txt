What do you think about the movie Beauty and the Beast?
Are you talking about the cartoon or the live action movie?
I rather talk about the cartoon.
Oh I love it! The songs are amazing.
What is your favorite scene?
It has to be while everybody sings and dances Be Our Guest.
Other than Belle, who is your favorite character?
Of course it has to be Lumiere, he is hillarious.
What do you think about Gaston dying?
I think they should have just banished him, and maybe they could have made another movie about his revenge or something.
