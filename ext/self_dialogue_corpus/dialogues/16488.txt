What do you think of Taylor Swift?
Hmm, I guess I never gave her too much thought.
Are you familiar with her music?
Well, yeah, I know her hits.  They never stop playing them on the radio.
That's true.
I know those songs but until you asked, I never really sat down and thought long about it.
Well, now is your chance.  Thoughts?
I suppose some of her music always came across to me as derivative.
How so?
Just that she sounds like every other pop artist out there, in my opinion.
I guess you have a point that pop music does sound similar in a lot of cases.
Yea.  Though I do have to say that despite that, she does know how to make catchy songs.
Yea.  They may not be the most complex songs, but they'll stay in your mind for weeks.
Whoever produces her music is really good at what they do.
I agree.  'Take it Off' is still stuck in my head, and I think I've only heard it a handful of times.
That one, I like too!
Do you think her pop music is better than her original "country" music?
Yes, for sure.  I never really saw her older stuff as country.
You and me both.
I'd say that's pretty universal.  Definitely prefer her stuff now versus before.
