What did you think of Alice Through The Looking Glass?
I thought it was very good. I liked it even more than Alice in Wonderland.
Really?
Oh, yes. The backstory on the Red Queen and White Queen explained why the Red Queen was so mean.
Why was she so mean?
When they were little the White Queen blamed her for eating the treats, so the Red Queen ran away.
Ran away! Where to?
She ran outside but she hits her head, so the White Queen is to blame for how big her head is.
Wow. I never would have expected that from the White Queen.
I know. She's not as innocent as she appears to be.
What did you think of Anne Hathaway's portrayal of the White Queen?
Honestly, I didn't think it was very good.
Me too. It just feels like I'm watching Anne Hathaway play dress up.
I agree. The difference between her performance and Johnny Depp's performance is astounding.
Johnny Depp does a good job as the Mad Hatter, but I honestly thought his performance was a little lackluster in Alice Through The Looking Glass.
Maybe it was just the plot.
You're right. He really wasn't his normal self for most of the movie.
Exactly. The Mad Hatter's family was missing after all.
Well, I thought Mia Wasikowska had a great performance as usual.
I've only ever seen her in the Alice in Wonderland movies.
