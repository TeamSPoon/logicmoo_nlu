Lady Gaga is so unique.
She really is!
She has a beautiful voice.
I like when she sings live and plays the piano.
Me too! Like when she sings You And I live?
Yes! How did you know that's one of my favorite?
DId you see the performance of You and I where she dressed in drag?
No way! She did?
Yeah. She had on a suit and it looked really awesome.
I want to see that!
