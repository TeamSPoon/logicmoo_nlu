The Texas Rangers have got to do better on the road.
How bad is their record?
They are 6-12 on the road right now. That's not going to get it done.
Yeah winning only 33 percent of your road games is receipe for disaster.
I mean think about it. They are awful on the road, but they are in 2nd place in the division.
So just imagine if they could at least play .500 ball on the road they could give themselves a real shot.
You would think so. You have to think that the Astros won't continue to play this well right?
Yeah they have to come back down to earth.
So if they could start picking up the pace on the road this could be an interesting divisional fight.
True, but something about the Rangers always worries me.
I know. They can never seem to get out of their own way.
I would probably give the Angels a better chance than the Rangers
I mean you could be right, but both teams have had their screw up moments
I can't disagree, but the Angels have Trout and the Rangers do not.
Point taken but the cupboard is not bare in Texas. They got some good hitters too.
No doubt. Both Joey Gallo and Nomar Mazara are having some good years
Yeah they just need more consistency away from their home confines.
Well the good thing is they have time.
Yeah but they are already 8 games back. You don't want to fall further behind.
True but they are in contention for one of the wild card spots if all else fails.
