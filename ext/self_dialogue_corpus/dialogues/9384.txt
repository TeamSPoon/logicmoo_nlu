Who is your favorite female R&B singer?
I love Jhene Aiko. Do you know her?
Wasn't she the one who sang "The Worst?"
Yes, I love that song because it is so relaxing. I love the album "Sail Out" where that song comes from.

I love "Bed Peace." Childish Gambino is in that song.
What do you like about that song?
The song is for light listening even though some of the lyrics is for adult.
What do you mean? Can you explain?
Well, why don't you just listen for yourself? Haha!
