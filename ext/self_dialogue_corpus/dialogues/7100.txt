What is your favorite animated Disney movie?
Snow White, hands down.
Why Snow White?
I saw it as a child and then again in the 1980s when it was re-released in the theaters.
What about it makes you like it?
The art of the animators. The scenery looks so lifelike.
Yeah, I do recall being impressed by that, too.
The water in the waterfall looks real.
What else do you like about it?
The music. I remember in the 80s when the first notes of Hi Ho were sung I got chills and teared up a little. It's such an iconic movie.
