Have you ever seen the movie Wanted?
Is that the movie with Morgan Freedman?
He's in there, yes, but there are plenty of other famous actors.
Like who?
Angelina Jolie is in there as the romance interest.
Oh, that's pretty cool. She's gorgeous.
Yeah, she's a looker definitely.
Was the movie any good?
I thought the idea was really good, but a good portion of the movie just felt so predictable and cliche.
What's the idea about?
It's kind of like The Matrix where a bunch of hyper-unrealistic shooting and fighting happen with an organization.
What's unrealistic about it?
Well, they shoot wings off of flies and get in cars while they're flipping over.
Wow, that's pretty crazy.
It sounds very cool, but is really kind of silly to watch.
Does it have a good ending?
It does, on paper anyways.
How's the ending go?
The organization turns out to be a fraud and corrupt, and the main people that are in it decide to destroy it.
Whoa, that's neat. I'll have to watch it sometime with you.
