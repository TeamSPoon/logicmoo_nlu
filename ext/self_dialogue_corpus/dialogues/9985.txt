Have you seen any good action movies?
I seen Wonder Woman, had a lot of action.
That movies was the best! How about some older action movies?
There is one called "Last Action Hero".
With Arnold Schwarzenegger?
Yes. Early 1990's. Action and comedy.
I thought I was the only person who ever saw that show.
It was silly, but the action was amazing!
I liked when the bad guys came out of the screen.
The one guy with the smiley faced eyeball? Scared me!
