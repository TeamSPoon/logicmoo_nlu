I'm not sure if I want to see 'Dunkirk' or not.
What's it about?
It's about soldiers from different Allied armies during World War II engaged in a pretty heavy battle in Belgium.
Sounds intense.
It could be, though I don't know if it'll be like 'Saving Private Ryan' or 'Black Hawk Down.'
Wow, those were really hard to watch.
They were. I'm okay if 'Dunkirk' isn't as tough. Sometimes hard scenes like that are impressive but can make the movie as a whole hard to watch.
That's true. Sometimes they overdo it even though it's more factual.
Christopher Nolan directed this one so you can be sure it'll be dark.
And take itself as serious as a heart attach.
Most likely. But it has an amazing cast.
I heard Tom Hardy is in it.
He is along with Kenneth Branagh.
I heard one of the guys from One Direction is in it.
Yeah, Harry Styles. It's his first film I think. We'll see how it goes for him.
It'll either be like Justin Timberlake or Vanilla Ice.
That's a huge spectrum. I think his part is small enough that it won't affect the outcome of the movie though.
When does it come out?
Next month. Not sure if it'll be a huge box office draw or not.
Let me know if you go. I might want to join.
