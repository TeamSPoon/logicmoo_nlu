Do you think Vader would have stayed good, had he not died in Star Wars?
I do not know, I think for a time.
He was so powerful, so much force was in him.
Yes, and it went dark, but Luke was powerful too.
There was a scene, when he confronts Jabba, where he is wearing black clothes and looking murderous, do you think that showed he will turn bad?
I think it shows he has the capacity. It is a tight balance, good and evil.
I wish he would, maybe start a new line of siths.
Darth Maul, maybe he could be the new him. Luke Maul.
I am serious, then he could be in control of the balance.
I do not think one man having that much power is any control of the force.
