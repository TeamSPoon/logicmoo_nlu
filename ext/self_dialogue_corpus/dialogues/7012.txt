Hey my daughter wants to watch something called Frozen, is that a good idea?
Yeah, how has she not seen it? Everyone has seen it.
Well not my daughter, what is it about?
Its about a girl who can freeze things with her hands, and some other stuff too.
Oh yeah, is this the one with all the ice in it?
Yeah thats the one, in the sort of fictional Scandinavian country.
Is it funny?
Yeah there's a lot of humor in it, both for kids and even a bit for adults?
Its a Disney movie, does anyone die?
Yeah, the parents drown in the ocean after their ship sinks, so, there's that.
