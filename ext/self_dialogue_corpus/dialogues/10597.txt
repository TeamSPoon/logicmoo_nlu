How well do you think The Rock fits into the Fast & Furious movies?
He is the only person I can see playing Hobbs in those movies.
He does bring a certain level of awesome to the film.
Totally, he's strong enough to be menacing but still able to make the jokes seem realistic.
He usually does play big goofy guys that still ends up kicking your teeth in.
What was your favorite Hobbs moment, any film?
It would have to be when he was in prison with Statham.
When Jason was saying how easy it would be on to beat up The Rock?
Yeah, then Hobbs just ribs the bench out of the wall and starts lifting it like weights.
The look on Jason's face was priceless; of course, The Rocks face was just as good.
