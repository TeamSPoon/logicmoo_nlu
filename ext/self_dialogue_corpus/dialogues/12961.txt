Can you believe they killed off Hans Solo?
Yeah what a major surprise!
Wonder why they did it?
I think for a few reasons.
Which are...
Kylo Ren gets positioned as a villain.
Mmm hmm. What else?
The new trilogy can go in a different direction.
That'll be interesting.
Plus maybe Harrison Ford was done.
