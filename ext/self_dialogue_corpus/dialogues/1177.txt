How do you think the Patriots will do this season?
They'll probably do great like always.
Yeah, Tom Brady still seems to be in his prime.
It's crazy.
What do you think their record will be?
Probably 12-4.
Yeah, I'm guessing 11-5 or 12-4.
They lost their RB, but I think they'll be fine.
They seem to just plug players in.
They could make a paper bag look decent.
They have the best coaching staff in the league.
Bellichek is a football genius.
He knows how to win that's for sure.
It'd be interesting to see how he would do without Brady.
Yeah, I'd love to see what he would do.
I think he'd still do decent.
I definitely wouldn't bet against him.
I'd be scared to personally.
Yeah, hard to go against a proven track record like he has.
That's for sure.
