Did you like Yoda as a character?
I didn't, not as much as some do.
Why not?
He was irritating and took up a lot of time.
He was irritating on purpose, though, in order to train Luke.
Why couldn't he have just introduced himself?
He didn't introduce himself so he could judge Luke's reaction.
He acted foolish.
But it was an act. He had great wisdom, like rejecting the title of a "great warrior."
I spuppose he did come off as wise.
