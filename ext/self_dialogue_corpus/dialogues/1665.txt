Hey I gotta extra Miami Dolphins jersey, you want one?
Sure, I'll take one.
I have so many extra football jerseys, brand new.
Do you have Dan Marino?
Yeah, I got him and all the rest, I got other teams too.
I like the Bulls.
Yeah they actually made it to the playoffs last year.
When you gonna send me that Dolphins jeresey?
I can send it to you first thing tommorow morning.
Okay, that would be great. I'll wear it when they play.
Dan Marino is doing Weight Watchers.
He is on Weight Watchers?
He's now working for Weight Watchers.
He doesn't ball anymore?
He retired a while ago. :(
I love the way he would throw that ball
Yeah, he did have a unique spin on it.
He should make a comeback.
If we get a tight team we can get a championship next season.
Yes, but the team management has to know what they are doing in order to get a tight team going.
