What do you think about the BFG?
The big friendly guy?
haha, yes
oh, now I remember, sophie, the orphan that had quite an amazing adventure in the realm of giant
yes indeed, she encountered the giant and helped him from being bullied by those savages
yeah, the brave little girl led the giant to see the queen in the palace, and they tried to serve the giant
oh that scene was hilarious, the giant brought over his own green potion that has bubbles going from top to bottom, remember?
yeah, it made them all fart quite dramatically
it's so funny
I could see myself seeing that movie again
