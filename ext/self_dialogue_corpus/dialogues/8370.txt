Who's your favorite pop artist?
I like Taylor Swift!
Cool. Isn't it funny that she started off as a country singer?
Yeah, but even then she wasn't super country. She is better as a pop singer for sure.
I liked 1989, but haven't really followed her, even though she seems to be everywhere.
That's a great album! Who do you like?
I'd have to say Madonna!
She rocks!
Yeah, I've been singing her songs since I was a toddler. I remember dancing to Vogue.
I think my favorite song of hers is Frozen.
