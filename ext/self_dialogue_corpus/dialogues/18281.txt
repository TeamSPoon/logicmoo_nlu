Do you enjoy listening to AC/DC?
I do once in awhile.
When would be an ideal time.
When i'm alone and just want to let loose.
What would be your ideal song to listen to?
Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap.
I haven't heard that song in years.
The lyrics are catchy.
So is the rhythm of the song all together.
It's very well done.
Also gets you in the mood to let loose like you said.
What about you when do you listen to the artist?
When i'm hosting a barbeque or another get together.
Really, seems odd since most people don't like the music.
Well it has the same affect of people just letting go of their normal lives for a bit.
I see, that's a good reason.
Usually play T.N.T at the event multiple times and other songs.
That's a good choice.
T.N.T. is my favorite song of theirs.
It's a good one.
