Did you think Attack of the Clones was out of place?
In the timeline?
I just feel like it was a half hearted movie.
It was an improvement over The Phantom Menace.
Darth Tyranus was pretty cool
I guess you could say that but some of the plot was boring.
Could you see them maybe going back to those years and doing more.
No I think most of the characters are now too old to do that.
Yeah but visual effects can change that.
Plus I think the character of Darth Sidious would be ruined.
