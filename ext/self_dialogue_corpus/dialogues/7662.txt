I finally got my kids to watch some of the Harry Potter movies!
Oh really, what did they think of them?
Well the youngest fell asleep during the first movie. The oldest stayed up almost all night with me watching two of them.
What did she think of them?
She loved them, she wanted to know what happened to the boy with the "scarf on his head and the man with no nose."
That's funny, you've got her addicted to them then?
Yeah, you can say that, she keeps asking me to watch more of them.
Good job, starting her out young, now you need to plan a movie night and have her watch the rest!
Oh I know, she will be so excited to watch them, pop corn and movie night with Mommy!
Sounds like fun!
