Did you ever see Oldboy?
No, what is that about.
It is a South Korean film that is intense.
What is it about?
A guy spends time in prison and searches for someone, its great.
That sounds exciting.
Yes it is a suspenseful thriller, for sure.
I like this genre.
Me too, you should watch it, it is a complex movie too, its great.
