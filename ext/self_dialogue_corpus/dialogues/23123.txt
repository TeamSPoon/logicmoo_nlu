Have you seen the Ring?
The movie?
Yes sorry I should have been specific.
Yeah I've seen it why?
What did you think of it?
I thought it was the most interesting and mysterious thriller/horror film i've ever seen.
That's a good thing.
Yeah it was a top notch well thought out movie.
I couldn't have put it any better.
The whole concept of the idea of this little girl being hurt was intrigueing.
Yeah that's pretty much the start of the encounter.
Then she seeks revenge and punishment on pretty much anyone who watches the film.
I think she was just trying to get people to help but in a weird way.
Help her how?
Well I think she just wanted to be found and understood.
That's very true.
Do you remember when she came out of the TV.
Do I , that is the most memorable part.
That was scary.
Yeah it was.
