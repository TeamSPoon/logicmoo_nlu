Hello. I want to see a good movie, which one do you recommend?
What type of movie do you want to see?
Well, I´m going to have some nephews over, so probably something kid friendly.
Then you´ll defiantly want to see a funny cartoon. Why don´t you watch the Simpsons movie?
The Simpsons? Aren´t they like old?
Yes, but they made a modern movie on 2007, which is hilarious.
Do you know what rating does it have?
Let me look it up on rotten tomatoes. It´s certifies fresh, with a rating of 88%.
Wow! Then it´s definitely a good one. I want them to have some choices, do you know of another one?
One came up to mind, which is funny, cute, not very recent one, but a must see with the family.
Really? Which one?
It´s called Over the Hedge, it´s from 2006.
What is it about?
These cute animals, which are obsessed with food and they have a hard time getting it and have to deal with humans.
Oh really sounds very interesting.
It will leave you with a warm feeling. Plus the voices are made by famous people.
Seriously?, Which ones?
It has Bruce Willis, William Shatner, Steve Carell,  Wanda Sykes, Avril Lavigne, etc,
Oh then I must be a very good one like you said.
It is! Plus it has very cool music, I think you and your nephews will enjoy it very much. Let me know what you think.
