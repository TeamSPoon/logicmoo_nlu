What's the best Bruce Willis movie?
He has a number of good ones!
If you had to just pick one, which would it be?
I would either say, "12 Monkeys" or "The Sixth Sense"
I haven't seen either of those.
Then you are in for a treat, because I have both on DVD!
Which should I watch first?
The Sixth Sense, unless you are a big Brad Pitt fan.
Why The Sixth Sense first?
Because moments after Bruce Willis drops his wedding ring, you will call me!
