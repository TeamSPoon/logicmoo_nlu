Since you love the Sgt.Pepper cover,than who are your favority celebrities on it?
Let me think a minute.
It sure was a work of art that cover/
Shirley Temple,Maryln Monroe,Huntz Hall and H.G.WELLS are my favorites.
I kind of like the more obscure ones like Fatty Arbuckle,and Tom Mix.
Yeah,those guys actually were not obscure in the 1960s.
Really?I didn't know that.
Yeah Fatty was the king of silent comedies in the 20s whose career was ruined by scandal,while Tom Mix was a popular singing cowboy who got killed in a car accident.
The albums just is amazing piece of pop culture.
Maybe the best album cover of all-time.
