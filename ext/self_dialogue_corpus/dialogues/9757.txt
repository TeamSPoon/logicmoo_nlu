Remember when Ice Cube used to be popular?
I know him, wasn't he in the rap group "C.I.A"?
Yes he was actually.
He's pretty talented.
I know, he's in quite a few movies now too these days.
Wasn't he also in another rap group?
He was actually, "N.W.A".
I thought so. He didn't stay with them for long though.
No, his first movie he acted in was "Boyz n the Hood."
I've never seen that. I'm a fan though so I'll look it up.
