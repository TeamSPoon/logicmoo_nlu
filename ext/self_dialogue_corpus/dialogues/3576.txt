We decided to watch all of the Nightmare on Elm Street movies this weekend.
Oh wow! Those are scary.
I know they had me scared to go to sleep.
Yeah because Freddy might get you.
Well I didn't want to have a nightmare.
Those movies really make your mind play games.
I saw them when I was younger but really never let them affect me.
I think as we get older we know that more dangerous things happen.
That could be it and our imaginations are more vivid.
Yes and with those movies it is all about imagination.
