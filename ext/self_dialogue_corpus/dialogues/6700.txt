What is your favorite Disney movie?
I like Cinderella
Cinderella is the best
I liked the part when the glass slipper fits her
Yeah, it was funny that the sisters couldn't fit it on their foot
Cinderella should have gotten out of that situation
I would not have put up with it
It was a nice house, but not worth it since she was treated worse than a servant
The stepmom was the worst
She was lazy
