What did you think of the new Jungle Book movie?
I thought it was amazing!
Really? I thought it was pretty good but I preferred the classic animated version better.
I actually preferred it to the animated one, the special effects were top notch.
Ya, but it seemed like they attempted to force in the classic songs at times.
I disagree, I actually think they were worked in pretty cleverly.
I will say that Shere Khan was pretty fierce.
The big gorilla was pretty intense too. It definitely had a darker feel than the original.
Ya, it scared my 4 year old though. I'm going to have to stick with the animated one for him for awhile.
Oh ya, I can see that. There were definitely some frightening parts.
I've heard they are remaking more of the disney movies as well.
Ya, like Beauty and the Beast and I've heard the Lion King is coming out in a year or two.
I'm definitely looking forward to that one. I'm curious how they'll make Scar.
Disney is definitely going to milk the money out of those.
Maybe my son will be able to handle those in a couple years.
Those should be fun to watch as a family.
Ya, as long as they don't get too intense though. I would think the Lion King could get pretty frightening.
Especially since they are more realistic than the animated ones.
For sure, we'll have to see how those go.
As long as they are like the Jungle Book, I'll keep watching them.
