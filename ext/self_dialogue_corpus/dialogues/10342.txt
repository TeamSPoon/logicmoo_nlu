Did you ever see Speed?
The movie from the 90's?
That's the one.  Keanu Reeves was in it.
Also had Sandra Bullock I think.  Launched her to stardom.
That movie had tons of great set pieces.  It was original too.
Dennis Hopper was awesome in that movie.  He played a truly good bad guy.
It's too bad they ruined it with Speed 2.
Never saw it.  Weren't they on a cruise ship?
Yep.
Yeah, I'll never watch that.
