HAVE YOU SEEN THE LION KING
YES. I HAD WAITED FOR WEEKS FOR ITS RELEASE
WAS IT EVERYTHING YOU EXPECTED
YES,AND EVEN MORE.
WHAT MADE IT SO SPECIAL WAS THE SONGS
YES,ESPECIALLY AT THE FIRST OPENING SCENE
YOU MEAN THERE ON THE MOUNTAIN AND THEM PLAYING THE CIRCLE OF LIFE
YEP. THAT PUT IT OVER FOR ME
I BELIEVE I COULD SET THROUGH ANTHER SHOWING
I KNOW I'LL HAVE TO WITH MY TWO YOUNGEST HAVING NOT GOTTEN TO SEE IT THIS TRIP
