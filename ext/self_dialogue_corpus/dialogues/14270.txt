Did you go to the game last night?
The basketball game?  Where was it?
At the high school.  It was a home game.
No, I had to work.
Oh, you totally missed it.  It was awesome!
Oh, yeah?  We won?
Yeah, the score was 87-42.
Wow.  That means the team is heading to the playoffs, right?
Yeah, the first round is next week I think.
Well, I'm going to have to make sure to take off for that one.
Yeah, that one is an away game, but we can ride together.
That sounds good.  So, I guess they buckled up on their defense?
Well, yeah.  The score at halftime was 42-30.
Seriously?  So, they only allowed 12 points to be scored in the whole second half?
Yeah, that's why I'm telling you it was awesome!
Wow, the other coach must have been livid!
Oh, he was, you should have heard him!
Those poor kids on that team though.
Well, at least their season is over and he won't be yelling at them anymore.
I guess if you look at it that way.
