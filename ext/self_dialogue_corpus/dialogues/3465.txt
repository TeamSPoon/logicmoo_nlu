Have you seen The Conjuring?
That is one of the best modern horror movies I've seen.
You're right. Really tastefully done, well made, and actually scary in parts.
Did you know Ed and Lorraine Warren were actual paranormal hunters?
Yes I did know that. They were involved in the case with Annabelle also.
I saw that movie, it creeped me out. I heard they still have that doll housed with the cursed objects.
Me too and I heard the Warrens visited the house in Amityville Horror when the family was living there.
I saw that documentary with the son, who actually lived there. She was speaking about the experience.
Yes and she said she carried a piece of the True Cross into that house with her.
Right. The Conjuring did their story justice. Not as many people would have known about their bravery if not for that movie.
