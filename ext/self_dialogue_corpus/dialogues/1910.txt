The NFL season begins on September 07, 2017 this year, and I can't wait.
Oh really? Do you know which teams will be playing?
Of course I know who is playing. It's my favorite team that won the Superbowl last year.
Are you talking about the Patriots?
Absoultely!! They will be playing against the Chiefs. I will be watching front center row.
Yeah the Chiefs are a good team.
But the Patriots are number one in my book, they have been my favorite team since the beginning. Who is your favorite team?
I am a fan of the Greenbay Packers.
Greenbay? They haven't won a superbowl since 2011 when they played against the Steelers.
Yeah that is true but the Packer played a good season that year and last year.
Hmm. What was the score when the Packers played against the Steelers in 2011.
It was pretty close. The score was 31-25
I guess Green Bay is alright but they are no match to the Patriots.
Oh man here you go with that again!!
Well I could actually brag. The Patriots won the super bowl in 2015 and 2017.
Yeah so what. You can't deny that the Packers played a good season last year.
Yeah I hear what you are saying.
I can't wait for the Packers first game this season so they can show you what they are made of.
Yeah we will just have to see about that. When do they play?
The Packers first game is September 10, and they are playing against the Seahawks.
