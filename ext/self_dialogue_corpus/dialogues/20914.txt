What kinds of movies do you like?
I'm an 80's movie fan. The comedies mostly.
Same here! I love the 80s. Especially the Brat Pack movies.
Yes, those are the best. What are your favorites?
Definitely Breakfast Club, Sixteen Candles, and St. Elmo's Fire.
Oh my gosh, Sixteen Candles is my all time favorite movie! It's hilarious!
It really is. Anthony Michael Hall was hilarious in that!
He really was. I like the two geeks with the dark hair.
Yes, they're funny. John Cusack played one of them.
That's right! His sister Joan was in the movie, too.
Yes, she was the awkward girl with the neck brace.
When she drinks from the fountain and wipes her mouth with her shirt! I couldn't stop laughing!
That part was funny. I love Long Duk Dong!!
Yes! Gedde Watanabe played his character. I love when he comes down from the bed and scares Molly Ringwald.
He says, "What's Happenin' Hot Stuff!" So, so funny!
I really enjoyed Michael Schoeffling in that film, too. He made a great Jake.
I thought he and Molly Ringwald were cute together.
I loved that they got together at the end. And the kiss on the kitchen table was so romantic.
The people he had over totally trashed his house. It was destroyed.
Yeah but that was more Caroline's fault for bringing everyone there. I couldn't stand her character!
