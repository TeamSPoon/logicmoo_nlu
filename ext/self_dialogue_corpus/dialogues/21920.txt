What role would you recast?
Katniss Everdeen in Hunger Game Series.
You don't like Jennifer Lawrence?
I love her, just felt she was wrong for the role.
How so? Isn't katniss kind of stoic?
I am more bothered by how far from the book version she seems.
What is so different to you? I don't get it.
Well Susan Collins wrote that Katniss was almost emaciated. Super skinny,
Jennifer is not fat by any means!
Not at all, but she is not malnourished. Especially before losing a little weight.
She does seem to have slimmed down the longer she is in Hollywood.
Overall just felt she was not true depiction of the character,I would have cast some waif actress.
Who could have been strong enough though, acting wise?
Isabelle Fuhrman maybe would have pulled it off more for me.
Wasn't she cast as Clove in the film?
Yes, I would have switch the two actors roles.
I think Jen was to biga star to take that role.
Probably true but Isabelle Fuhrman is a strong actress.
I think she was in the running for Katniss at one point.
Yes. If you saw her in Orphan, she proves she has some acting chops.
