Did you see that Houston/Spurs game?
Yeah, James Harden played terribly.
Do you think it will hurt his MVP chances?
I would imagine so. You going to watch Warriors/Spurs?
For sure, I think it will be a great series.
Me too. The Spurs have a shot.
Do you think they could win?
I don't know if they could win, but I think they can win a few games at least.
Only if Kawhi Leonard is okay, I think.
His ankle is fine, so he'll be playing.
Oh really? I hadn't heard.
Yeah, the coach said he will play game 1 on Sunday.
That's good news for the Spurs. Do you think they could win without him?
Win the series? Not a chance.
Agreed. They could win a game or two but not the series.
Do you think they could win the whole thing?
I'm not sure. I think it will be a Cavs/Warriors final again.
Me too, which is a shame.
Why is it a shame?
I just miss when the league was more competitive.
