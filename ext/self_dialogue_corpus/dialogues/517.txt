Hey, what do you think about football?
American or European?
American
It's fun to watch!
What's your favorite team?
Oh I don't have one
Not a huge fan then?
Nah, I'm from Germany and it's not common over in Europe
Fair enough
But I know that they are starting to have some games over there
Yea they're trying to get Europe more into football
Oh we're into "football"
Yea, but that's not "our" kind of "football"
Haha! I know, I know!
Did you watch the game when they played in Europe?
Nope!
Why not?
Too far away for me
Oh, yea I guess that might have been a bit far for you
Yea, maybe next time
