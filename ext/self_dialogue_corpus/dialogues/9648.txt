So what do you like better, the old Snoop Dogg music or newer Snoop Dogg?
That's a really tough call because all his music is great!  But I guess I'd have to say Doggystyle was his best.
Yeah, I can play that entire album over and over again.
Oh, I do, all the time.  His newer stuff has slightly more complex beats.
It seems a little different, yes.  He branched out in another direction.
But it's still great.  I love everything he's ever done.
He's definitely one of the best hip hop artists of all time.
Along with Tupac for sure.
Yeah, I wish they had done more music together.
Yeah, they would make a truly amazing duo.
