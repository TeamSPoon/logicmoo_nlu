Cars the original is a great movie.
I saw that.
The music is great.
There were lots of song I liked and knew.
I like it when they use songs like that and not just movie music .
It was rocken.
The characters wee also super.
I have watched it a bunch of times and each time the characters get better.
Filmore the hippy bus!
Love him.
Then there is Mater.
Love that Mater, tomater.
He really makes the movie, carries the Lightening Character some times.
The female characters were also pretty good.
There was Flo.
Yes that was who I was thinking about.
I liked Flo.
She was strong and pretty. Smart and careing, she held the falling community together.
The women holds it together and becomes the love interest, pretty classic theme.
And one that works.
