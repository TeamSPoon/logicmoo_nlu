I wished rap music could be like it used to be.
I agree, it seems so watered down these days.
I used to love Bone Thugs And Harmony.
I did to, they had some great songs.
What was your favorite song of theirs?
I would have to go with Crossroads.
I used to listen to that song all the time.
What about you? Did you listen to any of their other songs?
Yes, I used to love First Of The Month.
Yea, they do not make rap music like that anymore.
