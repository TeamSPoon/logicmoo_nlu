How do you feel about Lady Gaga's music?
I don't actively seek out her music, but when it comes on the radio, I don't turn it off.
Yeah? What song do you like most?
I've actually heard Paparazzi a lot lately and have found it stuck in my head.
Ha, that's funny. Are you aware of her support of LGBT rights?
Yes, I actually saw her recently on RuPaul's Drag Race.
I saw that too. I just wish they would have played some of her music during the episode. I kept seeing her and wanting to hear Poker Face or Bad Romance.
I agree. It was strange seeing her for that much of an episode, but not hearing any of her music.
Does she have any new music coming out?
I'm not sure. I think she just had an album come out last year, so probably not.
