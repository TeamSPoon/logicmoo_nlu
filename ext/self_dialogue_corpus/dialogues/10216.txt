If you haven't seen Edge of Tomorrow: Live, Die, Repeat you should go see it.
Who directed that?
It was Doug Liman.
He made a couple of the best Bourne films right?
Yeah, his Bourne films were really good.
What is it about?
A soldier keeps waking up over and over again and having to fight the same battles to get out of being stuck.
Kind of like Groundhog Day.
Yes, the same concept.
I like that kind of storyline.
