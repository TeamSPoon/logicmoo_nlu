I'm not a fanboy but I liked the song Heathens.
You know,not bad for a pop song.
Yea,a lot of pop songs sound the same.
Too many sound the same
I know what you mean.
I guess it came off the,Suicide Squad album.
Yes it did.
Big album for them.
As a pop band they're not bad overall.
I can stomach some of their songs
