Are you into scary movies?
Yeah, but it depends. I don't like cheesy scary movies.
Well, have you heard of the movie It Follows?
No I haven't.
Are you interested in hearing what it is about?
Sure, go ahead and tell me.
It is basically about a mysterious being that follows a person around and if it gets close enough it kills them.
That sounds interesting, and scary.
It really is, its one of the best scary movies I have seen recently.
So what determines who it follows?
Well I don't know what started it, but its passed along through sex from person to person.
So it comes after anyone who has sex with the carrier?
Well it goes down the line one by one whoever was the last person to have it.
So your saying if the person its following gets killed it will go after the person they last had sex with?
Yep, pretty much.
Man that sounds really scary.
It is especially scary because they never really know if its gone for good if they have sex with someone.
Yeah, its like they could get killed and it would come back for them.
That's pretty much what happens in the movie, but they try to kill it at the end.
Wow that's crazy, I'm gonna have to check it out.
