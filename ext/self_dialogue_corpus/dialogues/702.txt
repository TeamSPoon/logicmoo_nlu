Hey, what do you think about football?
As in the NFL?
I love it!
Oh, yea?  What is your favorite team?
Seahawks!
Really?  Why's that?
No specific reason.  I've just always liked them
Oh okay.
And your favorite team?
Patriots
Classic
Yea they are probably the most liked team in the NFL
... Or the most hated...
Haha! Lots of hate come when you're good!
I don't know about that
Still sore over the end of that one Superbowl game?
I guess you could say that
It was an amazing finish though
I can agree to that!
Talk to you later!
