hi jarry,whats good?
not bad man, how's it going at your end?
am doing great as well mate
alright cool
please i and francis is having a bit of an argument here so wanted to ask your opinion,got some time?
sure, what's it?
so can you classify rnb music as soul music?
well in my opinion i would say no, those two are two different genre of music.
great,so i thought but francis thinks otherwise
that they are same ?
yes
nah, because that's like saying beyonce does soul music and sade adun does rnb
exactly my point because rnd has some pop element infuse in it but soul music is pure soul music
same way i see although this topic can be tricky.
i don't think say its so straight forward,i had seen sade adun on interviews say she is a soul singer and had also seen mariah carey say she does rnb music, which shows they bot different.
hahaha you should be telling that to francis.
i'm but he's just not buying it.
then you have to leave him to his opinion.
true talk,would chat you up later.
alright mate.
