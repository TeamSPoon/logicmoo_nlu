Did you hear about the Beauty and the Beast Remake?
No, when did it come out? Is it new?
It just came out in 2017, but it is very different from the first one.
How is this movie different?
It is live action, not animated.
Who plays Belle?
Emma Watson.
The girl from the Harry Potter movies?
Yes, but she looks more grown up in this film and plays the perfect Belle.
Who else is in the new movie?
Dan Stevens plays the beast, Luke Evans plays Gaston, Kevin Kline plays Belle's father Maurice.
Who is Dan Stevens? What else would I have seen him in?
You may have seen him on Downtown Abbey, that show was very popular.
Who plays the enchanted characters in the movie? Like the clock and the candlestick?
Oh lots of great actors, Josh Gad, Ewan McGregor, Stanley Tucci, Ian McKellan, and Emma Thompson plays Mrs. Potts.
Is this a musical like the first movie?
Kind of, more like partly a musical because they only kept half the songs and went for a more serious tone.
It sounds very different, but will I like this new version as much as the original?
It is different but it has the spirit of the first movie. You should definitely go see this movie!
I will! Thank you!
