Who is the first head coach to go this year?
I mean is it always Marvin Lewis?
I know what you mean but I think he has the best job security
Why do you say that?
He should have been fired years ago.
Yeah besides him though who do you think gets fired first?
Its a tough one because I think the league is trending on patience.
Pederson in Philly?
They definitely give him the year.
When do you think they would fire him?
Midseason next year
Thats a rough time to fire a coach.
Yeah but they need to see what he does when Wentz has weapons
Well what happens if he does well but the defense still plays poorly
Then the defensive coordinator gets fired.
And Pederson is off the hook?
Until they miss the playoffs, yeah
Thats an easy out I believe
Not really you want to stick with a head coach and franchise quarterback
Yeah I guess I never think they are patient enough in the NFL
