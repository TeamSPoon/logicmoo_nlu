Do you want to go to the Mets game tomorrow?
Who are they playing?
The Yankees. It's supposed to be a good game!
Sure sounds like it. It will be the battle of New York.
You should definitely come. It's bound to be a good game, especially after the way the Mets played last night.
Who did they play?
The White Sox. It went into 13 innings.
I saw something about that on Sports Center this morning. The game sounded incredible.
It was. The White Sox won the game in the bottom of the thirteenth with a grand slam.
Did Wheeler start at the pitcher's mound again?
Yes. He's really turning into quite the pitcher.
I agree. He's got quite an arm.
So you'll come to the game tomorrow?
Of course. The Mets are going to be coming in with a lot of energy after that game last night.
Very true! I have tickets for behind third base.
Perfect. Have you always been a Mets fan?
No, believe it or not, I actually used to be a Marlins fan.
Why did you switch teams?
I moved up here to New York.
Oh gotcha. See you tonight!
