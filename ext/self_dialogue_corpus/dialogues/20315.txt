I want to go see Alien: Covenant.
I'll go with you.
We should get together and re-watch all the other movies first.
All you really need to see is Prometheus since that is the prequal to the others.
That's all you need, but why wouldn't you want to watch Alien, and Aliens.
I like Aliens, more than Alien.
I go back and forth. I love Bill Paxton in Aliens.
I know! Hudson was aweswome. "Game over man, game over!"
And Paul Reiser was perfect as the slimy Carter Burke.
An let's not forget Sigourney was way better in the sequal than the original.
In the first one she was just frightened.
In the second one she was ready to kick butt!
And save that little girl Newt because her own daugher died while she was in stasis.
That was really sad.
What was the androids name?
Bishop.
I thought he left her behind.
I did too.
It was a great idea to have him actually be a good guy.
It was a redeeming moment for all A.I.
