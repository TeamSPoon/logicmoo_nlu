Did you see the new Wonderwoman movie that just came out?
Yeah it was awesome! What did you think?
Well a stupid friend of mine asked, "does she even twirl?" which I thought was funny, but yeah, I LOVED it!
Me too, it was so amazing to see her presented as an Amazon warrior.
Yeah, you could totally tell it was directed by a woman.
Amazing job, just amazing.
What did you think of the CGI?
I thought it was great.  Well balanced and not too over the top like other action movies.
Yeah, the fight scenes, and the trench warfare were insane.
Do you remember when she just walked across no man's land while all the Germans were shooting at her?
I know right? talk about one bad ass woman!
She was such a bad ass.  And such a cute little girl too.
Aww, the young Diana was so cute doing her little fighting moves.
Didn't take long to grow up though.
Yeah, and when she rescued the hot hunk of a soldier...
Oh my god was he fine. "Bigger than average" apparently too.
Oh he was so sexy in that weirdly blue lit pool, water dripping off his naked body.
Yeah and when they were upstairs together.
Oh my, the director better left it unseen
I know right! Isn't the imagination much better at filling in what might have happened up there?
