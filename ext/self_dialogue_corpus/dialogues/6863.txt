I love watching Disney movies, do you?
Oh yes, one of my favorites is The Little Mermaid.
I enjoyed that too as a kid.
Another one that I love is Beauty and the Beast.
Me too! Have you seen the new version of that?
No unfortunately but I have been meaning too.
You need to watch it, I think it has Emma Watson in it. It's excellent.
I did hear good things about it!
Maybe one day they'll remake the Little Mermaid.
That would be pretty cool. I would enjoy that.
