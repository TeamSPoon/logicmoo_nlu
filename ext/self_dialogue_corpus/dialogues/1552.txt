Are you a football fan?
Not really, but I used to be a huge fan.
Why don't you follow it closely anymore?
I'm a Cincinnati Bengals fan.
What does that have to do with it?
I couldn't watch them lose in the first round of the playoffs every year anymore.
They used to be so bad, though!
I know. I started watching on a weekly basis in 1995 and considered myself a diehard fan until the second playoff loss to Pittsburgh.
How are they looking this year?
I don't know that much about them anymore, but I know they have offensive line issues that will make it hard to compete.
What do you think of Marvin Lewis?
He's made things much better than the 1990s but it's clear to me they won't be able to take the next step with him at the helm.
He's been there forever.
I know, he will never be fired. This is his 15th year coming up.
What do you think of Andy Dalton?
I think he's solidly a slightly above-average QB. His performance will hinge upon whether they can protect him, which is the team's main issue headed into 2017.
What about AJ Green?
AJ Green is truly great. It's been really exciting seeing the Bengals have a league-best talent, it's been really rare. With him and Geno Atkins it's been really cool to see.
Are you going to follow the Bengals in the upcoming season?
We'll see. I'm thinking about it right now.
