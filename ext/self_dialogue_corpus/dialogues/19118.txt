Do you still like Miley Cyrus and her music.
I still like her music.
Do you still like her as a person?
Somewhat I do though I find myself embarrassed for her sometimes and what she has done the past couple years.
She has definitely gotten more wild. Though I think lately she is getting better.
I like her new hair and didn't much appreciate her old hair.
Her new song called Malibu is great.
I haven't heard it yet. How is it?
It is a wonderful song that really shows she is still talented and can still make great music.
I will definitely have to listen!
She apparently wrote the song while in an Uber ride.
That is incredible she must be talented to have done that!
I know I can't do anything while I'm in the car and she writes a hit song!
Have you noticed Katy Perry is becoming like the old Miley?
I agree completely. She now has the same hairstyle Miley used to and is being inappropriate on livestreams.
I hope that Katy Perry can go back to being normal eventually. She is such a beautiful and kind woman.
She definitely is a great person that has been wild lately.
I guess every or most artists go through a wild phase.
They definitely do though I'm sure there are examples of artists who haven't.
Well I admire any artist who was able to keep writing great music without going wild or crazy.
