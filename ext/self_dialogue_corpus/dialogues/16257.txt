You know, for as much as I like music, I realized that I am terrible about knowing artists' albums and what songs are on each one.
Oh, I don't know any of that either. The only artist that I can tell you detail about the albums is Bruce Springsteen?
Really? Bruce?
Yes, he is my all time favorite and over time, I guess I just learned most of his albums.
I think I could name maybe four songs by him.
Let me guess: Born to Run, Born in the USA, Dancing in the Dark, and Badlands.
That's really funny. I think that pretty much covers it. How did you know?
Those are pretty much the songs that most people know. He has so much more though.
I would think so. He has been around a long time.
Forty-four years since his first album with the E-Street Band.
Are you serious? His first album was in '73?
Yes, Greetings from Asbury Park. And he played with other bands before that but nothing that had any commercial success.
That is a really long time. There aren't many other artists who have that kind of longevity.
What is really impressive about him too is that he doesn't just rely on his older music. He still write and records new albums.
That is impressive. So different that Billy Joel.
I know. He is another artist with longevity and commercial appeal, but his last album came in what? 1991?
River of Dreams was 1993. He technically had one in 2001, but it was his classical compositions, not actually him singing.
Well, I don't count that then!
Oh I know. It's just that most people don't know about that one.
I certainly didn't.
