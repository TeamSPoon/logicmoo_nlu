I am in the mood to watch an exciting movie!
Yea that would be fun. I have not seen a good one in a while it seems like.
What type of movies do you normally enjoy watching?
I can usually watch just about anything. I love action movies myself.
Yea, you can not beat a good action movie in my opinion.
Who would you say is your favorite actor?
I think I would have to say Samuel L. Jackson is my favorite.
He has put out a lot of good movies over the years.
I love so many of his movies. It seems like he sticks true to making great action films.
I know what you mean. What is your favorite movie from him?
I do not think I could narrow it down to one! I love just about all of his films to be honest.
I know what you mean; I always loved that movie Snakes On A Plane.
That was a great movie! I have watched that one at least four times.
Yea it is one of those films that you can watch over and over again.
Have you ever seen Coach Carter or Changing Lanes?
I have seen Coach Carter, but I do not think I have watched the other one before.
Changing Lanes is a suspense thriller that stars Jackson and Ben Affleck.
I think I have seen the previews for that one before, it looks really good.
You should watch it! It was really good in my opinion.
I will do that! Anything with Jackson in it will most likely be pretty entertaining.
