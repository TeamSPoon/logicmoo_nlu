Hey, have you seen the new Disney movies?
Only the 2016 ones, I haven't see any 2017 Disney movies.
So, which one did you see?
I saw Zootopia and Moana
I saw those two movies too, they were very popular.
What you think of them?
I only watched Moana for Dwayne Johnson...wasn't as magical as previous Disney movies, but not bad.
What about Zootopia?
Ehh, not as wonderful as I though it would be, but still a good quality movie.
I think there's a little propaganda in there. But that's everything nowadays.
