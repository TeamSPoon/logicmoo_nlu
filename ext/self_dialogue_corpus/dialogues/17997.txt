When my high school sweetheart broke up with me, he used the lyrics of an old Fall Out Boy song.
That's rough.
Yeah. Whenever we'd get in a fight, he'd post lyrics to a sad song on his Myspace.
I definitely did my share of that.
Same. Now whenever I listen to music like Fall Out Boy or Panic! At The Disco, I get nostalgic.
Nostalgic for teenage heartbreak?
Kind of. Emo music will always have a place in my heart.
What kind of music do you listen to now, though?
Mostly '80s new wave music.
Like Joy Division?
Yeah, or New Order.
What's your favorite New Order song?
It's called "Ceremony." Have you heard it?
Yes, but I like "Age of Consent" much better.
I didn't know you were a fan of new wave.
Yes, I am actually a very big fan of New Order.
What other songs do you like by them?
"The Perfect Kiss" is a classic.
Have you heard the version called "Kiss of Death"?
No, I'll have to look it up.
