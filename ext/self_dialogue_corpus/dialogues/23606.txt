Have you seen Alien: Covenant yet?
No, not yet--don't spoil it for me!
I'm not going too, I can't, I haven't seen it either.
Good, I'm really looking forward to it.
Me too; I really liked Prometheus.
I did too, even though some of the critics were hard.
The critics are beating up on this one a little, too. They say it is real slow.
I don't mind, as long as they show what happens with the engineers and the woman from the first one.
I think the android David kills all the engineers, or something.
Don't spoil it!
Don't worry, I'm not sure it's right. Besides, it was all over the internet before the movie came out so it's probably wrong.
Good, I don't want it spoiled.
I wonder if they will show how the Xenomorphs are created?
That wasn't really clear in Prometheus.
No, it wasn't.
Prometheus raised more questions than it answered.
I agree! I hope to see it soon.
We should see it together! What are doing Friday.
I'm free! Let's go.
It's a date.
