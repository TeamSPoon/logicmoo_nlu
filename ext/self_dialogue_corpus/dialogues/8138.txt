Did you ever listen to Britney Spears?
I never was a fan, but I know all about her.  Pretty much everyone does.
Why didn't you like her?
She kind of had a nasally voice.  I just didn't care for it.
Did you know her sister is still in the music business?
Oh, is she a singer?
I think she used to be, but she's writing music now.
Really, anything good?
I know she's had some country hits.
Well, I wouldn't have expected that.
