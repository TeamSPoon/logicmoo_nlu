Do you like pop music?
Yes, I don't mind it. It isn't my favorite genre but it is catchy.
Anything in particular that you like?
Well, I grew up in the 90s so I'm partial to the late 90s/early 2000s pop.
Oh, so you are into the boy bands and the teen idols.
I guess you can say that. I mean, who can really turn down Backstreet Boys or N*Sync?
If you say so! I like the more recent music like Bruno Mars, Pharrel, and Ariana Grande.
That's definitely not my style. Give me some Spice Girls and Britney Spears, though, and I'll be happy.
I'd love the Spice Girls to make a return.
That would be amazing. They did it once, but unfortunately just for a short time.
