Hey Fred! Did you watch the Nuggets game last night?!
Yea man, that was a nail biter but Gallinari sure sunk a sweet one for the win!
Yea he did! I wish I could have been at that game. You goin to any games soon?
Actually I am. I'm going when the Suns come to town. I have some really good seats. You wanna join? I have an extra ticket.
I would love to join! I never miss an opportunity to go to the Pepsi Center and see our boys live!!
Fantastic! Nuggets vs Suns here we come!
I can't wait! I'm hoping our young team can really come together this season. A lot of promise there.
Yea they really have to come together cause our Western Conference opponents play some fierce ball.
We'll see what these guys have in them. I know that the individual development I've seen is pretty impressive.
They really have to focus on road games. That's an area needing serious improvement if they want to see the playoffs.
Absolutely. 15-26 on the road is not playoff material.
Seven of our last nine are on the road! That is going to be crucial.
I think Beasley is going to be a huge factor. And you can see him shake that rookie mentality/play now that it's his second year.
Agreed. And you can really start to see the team build around Jokic.
We are making progress that's for sure. Probably won't be this year but watch out next year!
Yea I think we will make the playoffs but won't go anywhere. Still need time to build.
Yea. Did you see Bradley's jersey got retired at his high school where he played.
No I didn't! That's awesome. The kid definitely showed his talent from day one.
Murray is having a speedy recovery too which is nice.
Yea Coach Hess is really focusing on him and his recovery. A lot of special workouts and PT. Well, I'll catch you later. Don't forget about the Suns game!
