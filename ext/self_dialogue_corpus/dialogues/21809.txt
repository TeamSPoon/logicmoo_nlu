Hey have you ever seen Natural Born Killers?
I love that movie! Woody Harrelson rocks in that!
Yeah I love him and Juliette Lewis. I loved her in Cape Fear.
Oh now that's a great movie! Did you ever see the original with Gregory Peck and Robert Mitchum?
I did but it was after I saw the remake. I like the remake better.
Martin Scorcese is one of the best directors that ever lived.
Oh he's awesome. Casino is one of my favorite movies that he directed.
That's one of my favorites and also Shutter Island.
That was with Leonardo DiCaprio right?
Right. One of his best roles in my opinion.
Did you ever see Leo in What's Eating Gilbert Grape?
Wow yes he did an outstanding job in that. I liked him best in Titanic though.
Oh everyone loved Titanic. I saw that three times at the movies when it first came out.
I actually didn't see that until it came out on dvd later.
It's a different experience watching it in theater.
I bet, with all the special effects on the big screen.
Yes it's amazing, like watching Star Wars on the big screen. Nothing compares to that.
Are you a big Star Wars fan?
Yes I am, seen all of them at least 10 times each.
I still have not seen one Star Wars movie to this day.
