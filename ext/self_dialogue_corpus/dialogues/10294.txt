What did you think about Suicide Squad?
On a scale of 1 - 10?  Maybe a 5.
That seems a bit low.
A few reasons for that.  For one, it definitely didn't focus on the Joker enough.
Okay.
And two, it was way too easy to kill the end guy.
It did take the fire gangster to do it though.
That's my point.  They should have just sent him in alone.
But then you wouldn't have a squad at all, just a guy.
I'm just saying.  Kind of made the ending weird in my opinion.
