Have you seen the new Beauty and Beast movie?
Yes, It was great! What did you think?
I loved it. Maybe even more than my kids!
Was that really Emma Watson singing?
Yes! I never knew she could sing.
I think she was great as the role of Belle but I counldn't help but think about Harry Potter!
I agree. I think they did a really great job recreating it.
It was actually better than I expected.
I am glad I bought a copy of my own. We have watched it several times already.
I will probably go get a copy for my collection too.
