Okay, I hate to do this.  But I'm going to do it anyway.
Alright, let's hear it.
The Beatles or the Rolling Stones?
Okay, here we go; Beatles ALL the way.
I knew you'd say that.  No way, definitely the Stones.
How?!  The Beatles are the most influential musicians of the last century.
Three words: "Paint. It. Black."
That's everyone's answer.
Doesn't make the song any worse.
Way too much grief and death in that song.
But that's what makes it so exciting.  Very edgy, but exciting at the same time.
It doesn't really do it for me.  I preferred "Gimme Shelter"
That's my second favorite.  Let's hear your 'Beatles' pick now.
"Hey Jude"
Great pick.  Though songs like "Sympathy for the Devil" and "Midnight Rambler" top anything by the Beatles.
Agree to disagree.  At the end of the day, I love them both.
Yea, both bands had their own style but it worked for them.
And they contributed so much to music.
I agree.  Let's listen to some music.
Only if we start with the Beatles!
