Wow! The new Burial album is just incredible!
Who is Burial?
You don't know who Burial is?
I've never heard of him. Tell me more.
Burial is the pioneering artist of Future Garage music. It features scattered broken beats, dark bass-lines, and soulful vocals.
Sound pretty interesting!
It is definitely my favorite music genre, and Burial is probably still the best.
What albums are a good place to start? I am really interested now!
Personally I would recommend the album, "Untrue" because it really has something to suit most tastes in music, and is a really solid work of art.
You had me when you mentioned "soulful vocals". What are some stand out tracks from this album?
The one that most people know and love is called "Archangel", which is a great introduction, but my personal favorite is Ghost Hardware because of the dark atmosphere.
Dark music is something that I have always gravitated towards. Are the songs similar to say... Massive Attack?
In certain ways Burial reminds me of Massive Attack, but only a little bit. His sound is unique and unlike anything you have ever heard.
Fantastic to hear that because I am a big fan of music like that.
Now that you mentioned it, there is a Burial collaboration with Massive Attack called Paradise Circus.
Oh my god! Why Have I not heard of this?
It's not really very well known, but I think that is one that you should look for.
Thank you so much for the recommendations!
I'm always happy to help someone find new music.
And I am always happy to discover new things!
