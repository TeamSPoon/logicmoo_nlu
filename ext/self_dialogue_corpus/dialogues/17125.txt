Who is the best rock and roll band of all time?
Easy: Van Halen.
No way. Van Hajen is good but they aren't the best of all time.
Ok, then who is?
The Beatles.
Look, I know everybody worships the Beatles, but I don't think they're the best of all time.
Ok then, who is?
Well since I can't answer Van Halen, I'll say AC/DC.
They might be the best heavy metal band of all time, but not the best rock and roll band.
Oh please. Then who is the best rock band of all time?
The Rolling Stones.
Ok, now you're talking. I could agree with that.
But I'm not sure the best heavy metal band is AC/DC.
If not AC/DC, then who?
KISS.
Look, KISS is legendary, but I wouldn't call it heavy metal.
Why not?
Remember "I was made for loving you"?
Oh yeah. I guess they would be considered rock.
Exactly my point.
