Did you hear Chris Cornell died?
Oh no really?
Yeah, apparently he performed a concert in Detroit and then was found dead in his hotel room.
That's a shame.  I loved both Soundgarden and Audioslave.
What were your favorite songs?
I loved Black Hole Sun by Soundgarden and I have to say I Am The Highway was my favorite Audioslave song.
Like a Stone was probably my favorite Audioslave song.
He basically helped pioneer the whole grunge rock thing in the 90s I feel like.
Definitely.  Him and Nirvana and Pearl Jam.
Those were some great days for rock music.
