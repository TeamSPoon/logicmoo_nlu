Did you hear about the old Los Angeles Coach?
No! Which One?
Hall of famer Tom Lasorda!
No what happened?
They said he's been hospitalized.
For What?
The club didn't provide any details. It just said that he's restin comfortably.
I wonder what happened.
I think maybe its his age.
How old is he?
Old man Lasorda is 89 years old.
He did a lot for the Dodger's organization.
Yeah! he spent over seven decades with them.
He has been a pitcher, coach and manager for the Dodgers, and guided them to their last World Series championship in 1988.
I hope everything will be fine.
Yeah, I know. But old age catches up to you.
Lasorda makes numerous appearances on behalf of the Dodgers.
He is a staple in that organization.
I might go watch some old Dodger's tapes.
I think I might just join you.
