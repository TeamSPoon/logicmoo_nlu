We watched a great scary movie last night.
Which one?
The Conjuring Two.
I didn't see that one. I heard it was good.
Did you see the first one?
Yes. I liked it.
The same people were in it, only it was in England.
Those were real people.
You mean the investigators right?
Yes. They did a lot of paranormal investigating.
Yes. They were Real.
Do you believe that stuff happened?
Yes, actually I do.
Was the second movie as creepy as the first?
Yes, Especially with the Nun.
I saw a picture of the Nun. It was creepy looking.
I thought it was well done.
I'll have to watch it.
I recommend it.
I'll watch it on HBO.
