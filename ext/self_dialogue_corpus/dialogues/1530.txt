Do you think anyone can beat the Patriots this season?
I'd like to think so, but they always seem to come through.
True. That huge comeback against Atlanta in the Super Bowl was infuriating.
Yea, Tom brady isn't going anywhere any time soon, either.
Nope, and they should have Rob Gronkowski back at tight end, also.
Yep, plys they added Mike Gilleslee from the Bills for backfield help.
Yeah, I am not sure anyone in the AFC can challenge them.
Definitely not in the East. the Dolphins may win 9-10 games, but the Bills should only win 8 and the Jets may win none.
Right. And other than the Steelers, there's no one else who could post a threat in the conference.
Well, maybe the Raiders could. if Derek Carr didn't get hurt before last year's playoffs, they may have beaten New England.
Probably not. But with Marshawn Lynch getting some carries now, they could maybe do something.
It would be hard for Brady to get away from Khalil Mack on the pass rush.
Yep. But no one else has the talent to beat them in the AFC.
And who knows if the Falcons can soar again in the NFC?
Yeah, that felt like a lucky run. Dallas and Green Bay could emerge from that conference.
True. And the Buccaneers are vastly improved. But could the beat the Pats?
I doubt it. As annoying as it is, we may be loking at another New England Super Bowl.
Unfortunately. Kinda takes some of the fun out of the season.
But at least there won't be any more Deflategate stories this season.
True, but I'd just assume never hear about The Hoodie again.
