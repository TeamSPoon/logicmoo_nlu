They are pretty solid
What sorta music are they?
They are mid beat Deathcore
Is deathcore that chug chug genre?
Nah it is not all like that
What does that mean
It means their is alot of break downs which their is
What is a break down
It is when the music slows itself and instruments play in parts hence breakdown
Sounds interesting.
