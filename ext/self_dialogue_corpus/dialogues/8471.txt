How do you feel about Justin Bieber?
Honestly, I made fun of him a lot when he first started out and was young.
Well, his voice was really high.
Yeah. I like his music a lot now actually. Especially post Selena.
I've always loved his music, even when he was young!
What's your favorite old song of his?
I liked One Less Lonely Girl. It was so cute!
What's your favorite recent song?
I love his song called I'm The Only One.
That one is really good.
