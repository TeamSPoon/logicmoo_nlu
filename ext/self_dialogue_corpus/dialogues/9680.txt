Did you ever listen to Snoop Dogg's music at all?
I did a little bit. I like his voice.
Remember that song he rapped called "Murder" or something like that?
I do! It was kind of a different song.
I think he wrote that because he was accused of murder.
You're right I remember that. He was acquitted though.
Yep. I watched part of the trial.
I was a huge fan of his song "Gin and Juice" also.
Me too!
I wish they still rapped like they used to.
