Do like star wars movies?
I do, but the originals are my favorite by far.
I love the originals, george lucas is great. I did like the newest ones too. Did you not like them?
I did enjoy them, just not as much as the originals. I liked how forward the females were in the last two.
Ya , it is an interesting thing to see how differently the females are being portrayed now. I liked having the female hero.
Me too, but I worry now that it seems to be repeating itself. anything done too much gets boring.
I suppose I agree, it could get played out . But then again look how long males have been typically the lead. Decades with luke, han, darth...
True, perhaps this is just where all movies must go now to change up what has become played out. I wonder what george think of this, do you ?
I do wonder sometimes if he approves of these new disney versions. I honestly think they are much better than the ones he did in between.
Agreed, the cgi was not a good choice, and jar jar was so annoying. I am glad the star wars franchise has redeemed itself. Looking forward to the next one.
