Did you ever see the original Alice in Wonderland by Disney?
I've seen Alice in Wonderland, but I don't know if it was the one you are talking about.
Yeah, there are so many versions of the story.
Yeah, but I think Disney really popularized it as a movie.
They probably did.
I'm sure the one I saw was the original.  It had the look of it.
Didn't Disney redo Alice in Wonderland recently?
Yeah, I think they did.
I actually didn't see the newer one.
I didn't either, but my sister said it was awesome.
