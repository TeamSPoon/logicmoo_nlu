Have you seen the latest Harry Potter film?
WHich one are you talking about?
Fantastic Beasts and Where to find them.
I did not even know that was a Harry Potter movie
Well it does not have Harry in it, but it is based off the the Harry Potter books.
Oh I will have to check it out, If the original cast is not in it, is it set at Hogwarts?
No, it is kind of a prequal, taking place years ago before Harry
Is it magical too?
yes, filled with magic and creatures
it is set in England
No actually in the US
sounds fun and interesting, I will check it out.
Do you know if there will be another Hunger Games movie?
well the others were based on the books, unless she writes another I so not see any more.
oh the author of the books is a woman?
yes her name is Susan Collins
I love all of those movies
I like them too, such an original story
But I dont like they made the last story into 2 movies
I agree the book was not that long to make 2 movies out of it but it was still well done
