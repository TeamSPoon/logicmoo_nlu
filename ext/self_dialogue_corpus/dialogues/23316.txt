What did you think of Allied?
I thought it was ok. There were a lot of cool elements, but it was not as good as I expected.
What do you mean?
I guess I wanted more of a fun, spy type of thriller. It was that in the beginning, but the second act just turned into a melodramatic love story.
Yeah, I can see that. It was kind of a downer, Hallmark ending.
I know. I wanted Marion Cotillard's character to not be the bad guy in the end. Or at least if she was, that she be a cooler character.
Yes, I could have done without the whole part where she had a baby and their family life. That was boring.
I agree. I just wanted more action. There were some cool visuals, though.
Yeah. I liked the party scene where the the plane came crashing towards the house. The tracking shot in the party was good, too.
I know. Robert Zemeckis alwasy does cool shots like that. I like his atmosphere.
Yeah, it reminded me a little bit of What Lies Beneath.
Yes, that was a good movie. Marion Cotillard was really good in it, though.
Yes. She's great in whatever she does. Brad Pitt was good, but kind of wooden.
Yeah. He looked like he was melting during the whole movie.
Lol. Yes, he's starting to show his age. Still hot, though.
Totally. I think he could have showed some more intensity and range in the part.
Yes. He didn't have a lot of good material to work with though...with dialogue, anyway.
Yes. The character was written in kind of a flat way.
The love scene in the car was good.
Yes! Very passionate.
