Are you ready for some football?!?
Hell yeah!
What are you looking forward to the most this season?
Honestly, I'm more into the fantasy football aspect of it than anything else.
Oh really? Big gambler?
We don't even place money. Just general competitive spirit.
Oh that's cool. I'll occasionally play but I like to put a little extra money on it to keep it interesting - at least lose buys lunch sort of thing.
Ah I could get into that. Might have to play with you this year.
You should. Where do you play now?
One of the online communities I belong to sets up a league each year.
So you're not into it at all for the actual sport?
Oh I am it's just not my biggest reason for following. I used to watch college football and basketball almost religiously.
Oh? Who'd you follow?
University of Oklahoma, of course!
Really? Thought most from your town were Oklahoma State fans.
They are... but they don't know any better. Actually my whole family supports OU so I just sorta grew up into it.
Cool cool. My family were big Kansas State fans so I guess it's pretty much the same for me.
Gotta love family. I actually follow pro more now and the Kansas City Chiefs are on my top three teams.
Shouldn't be a surprise but they're my number one pro team. What's your other two faves?
Dallas Cowboys because of similar family reasons, but it's a close tie between Denver Broncos and Atlanta Falcons.
