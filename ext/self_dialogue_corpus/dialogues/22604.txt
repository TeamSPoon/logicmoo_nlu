Have you seen any good movies?
I just saw Fight Club.
That is an old movie.
Yeah, but it's good.
I love that movie.
Brad Pitt is awesome in it.
How long until you figured out Tyler Durden was his alter ego?
I didn't know until the very end.
Did you see all the hidden Tyler pictures?
I saw a couple of them.
They are all throughout the movie.
So was Marla dating Ed Norton or Tyler Durden?
She thought she was dating Ed Norton.
That was the strange part to me.
What's that?
That Ed Norton's character didn't know he was dating Marla.
Yeah that was a little strange.
Did you read the book?
No, I heard it was good.
I read it before I saw the movie.  I liked the movie better.
