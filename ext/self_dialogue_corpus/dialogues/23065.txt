Hey, did you recognize the blonde guy in Saw?
I think so, but I couldn't place where I knew him from. It bugged me the whole time.
What if I said, "as you wish"?
Oh my gosh!
Now you recognize him, huh?
It's Westley!
From the Princess Bride!
Why didn't you point him out to me sooner?
I figured you'd get it eventually. Plus I didn't want to ruin it for you if you'd picture him as Westly and not this character.
I probably would have at that.
Isn't it weird to see Cary Elwes in such a different role?
Yeah, that's probably why I didn't recognize him.
He's still just as good looking even as the participant of a macabre game.
If not more so. At least in this role he looks more approachable and normal.
Yeah I get what you mean. And not playing the outlandishly suave dread pirate Roberts.
I'll still take him as the masked sword fighter any day.
Who wouldn't?
Well now I'm curious what other movies he's been in.
Well, not a movie, but I remember him being in Psych as an art thief.
I can picture that.
