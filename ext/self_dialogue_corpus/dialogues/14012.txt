Did you buy Lady Gaga's Joanne album?
No, I was going to.
Well what happened?
I bought ARTPOP when that was released.
What does that have to do with Joanne?
After ARTPOP, she fired her manager and I don't think that her sound would be the same.
Well I bought the Joanne album and I like it.
What's your favorite track off of Joanne?
I like Perfect Illusion.
I like that too but didn't know it was on the Joanne album.
