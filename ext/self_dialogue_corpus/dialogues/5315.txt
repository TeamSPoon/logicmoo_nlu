Haven't you watched Finding Dory yet?
No, i'm dying to, how was it?
It was awesome, Disney really scored a perfect 10 with this one.
Really? Even more than Finding Nemo?
Well, I loved Finding Nemo, but i think this one has more characters which makes it more interesting.
Does Ellen still do Dory's voice?
Yes, and i think she's pretty hilarious.
I know, Dory is actually my favorite character.
Oh, Dory is so loveable.
I know, i can't really wait to see it!
