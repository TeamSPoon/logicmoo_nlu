Have you seen the Dark Knight Rises?
Yeah, it was great.  I like the way Health Ledger was the Joker.
In my opinion he was the best Joker.  Too bad how he died.
I know, it was.  But the movie was still amazing.
I loved the part where he always said "Do you know how I got these scars?"
I know, and it was always a different story.
Most under appreciated part of that movie was Two Face.
Yeah, he was awesome.  He should have gotten his own movie.
That would have been ideal. But not every villain can have a movie.
Changing subjects who do you think was the best Batman?
I liked Bale.  I mean Keaton was good too but Bale just had that Batman violence to him.
I know, and he was the perfect Bruce Wayne.
Imagine if you could combine Keaton as Batman and Bale as Wayne.
That would be a perfect Batman.
I'm going to miss Keaton and Bale but Aflick seems to be pretty good so far.
I know, and that was the part I worried about.  I can't believe he was awesome and the rest of the movie struggled.
So here's how I rank movie Batmans.  Bale, Keaton, Aflick on top, then Kilmer, and finally Clooney.
Don't forget West did a movie too.
Yeah, he was more comedic though.
I know, too bad he died recently.  That was nice how LA put up the Bat single.
