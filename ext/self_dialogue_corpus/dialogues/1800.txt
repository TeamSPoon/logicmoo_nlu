So how are the Steelers going to do this year?
I think they have a chance to be really good.
Do you think they're better than last year?
I think so, as long as Martavis Bryant comes back strong.
So you think he can be a big difference maker?
Definitely, they lacked that strong number two receiver last year.
He stretches the field too, doesn't he?
Yeah, you have to respect his deep threat at all times.
But how do they beat New England?
They have to start playing man-to-man.
Do you think they have the players to do that?
Probably not, but Brady is going to burn you either way.
But doesn't man-to-man make it worse?
Death by 1000 cuts is no better than losing to quick strikes.
You're looking at a blow-out then though.
Not if the offense can keep up and the aggressive defense creates a few turn-overs.
So do they make the Superbowl?
Most likely not.
How far do they go?
They'll probably lose in the AFC Championship to New England, haha.
