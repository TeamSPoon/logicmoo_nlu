The music in Spike Lee's films is always so good.
I haven't really paid attention to it, well, I guess I've only seen a few of his films.
Did you ever see Do the Right Thing?
Yeah, I remember Public Enemy in that.
Yes, but his father was a jazz musician and he did parts of the scores to many of Spike's movies and there is always great music in each scene.
I remember Mo' Better Blues.  That was kind of jazzy.
Yeah, jazz and blues, his father had some influence on that but I think it was the Marsalis brothers, Wynton and Branford, that arranged it.
I don't remember the songs.
I was thinking of Crooklyn, especially.  There was a lot of 1970's soul in that film, because it took place in the 70's.
What songs were in Crooklyn?  I don't think I've ever seen it.
Pusherman by Curtis Mayfield, Mighty Love by the Spinners, Thin Line Between Love and Hate by the Persuaders.  Just fantastic.
I love Curtis Mayfield and The Spinners.  I'm going to have to check out the soundtrack.
Speaking of soundtracks, do you have a favorite?
Actually, my favorite soundtrack of all time is from Twin Peaks.  It's cool to see the new Twin Peaks, and the new music David Lynch has chosen for it.
That Julee Cruise song I remember, was really good.  What was it called?
Falling.
Yeah, it was kind of spooky.
I heard that This Mortal Coil is going to cover it for the new Twin Peaks.
I love this Mortal Coil.
Yep, "Song to the Siren" is one of my favorites.
