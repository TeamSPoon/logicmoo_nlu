I heard that they're making live action versions of a lot of old Disney movies!
I heard that as well! I love the cartoon versions but can't imagine how they are going to re-create some of them.
Have you seen the most recent Beauty and the Beast?
No, I haven't but I would like to. I really like Emma Watson.
I wonder who they would cast for the live action Ariel in the Little Mermaid!
I have no idea! What about Sebastian the crab?
I don't know that either.  I was thinking maybe someone like Ariana Grande for Ariel. She has a lovely singing voice.
She could work... She would have to wear a red wig though. I bet the songs would be beautiful with her voice.
She sang a song on the Beauty and the Beast soundtrack.
Yes, I heard the song! It was great!
