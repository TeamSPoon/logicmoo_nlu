Are you a season ticket holder for any NFL teams?
Yes, I'm a big Dallas Cowboys fan - I go to most of their games.
Hey, how about that - I live in Austin and I'm a Cowboys fan too - great franchise.
Yeah, it's a family affair with the Cowboys - we've been going since I was a kid.
AT&T Stadium is a great venue for them to play in.
Yeah, I preferred it when they called it Cowboys stadium, but I guess you have to have corporate sponsors of some kind.
I really like the dome - makes the games fun to watch in any weather condition.
True, and the screen is enormous - I think that it adds a lot to the Cowboys experience.
It will be interesting to see how Kellen Moore performs as Quarterback.
Yeah, too bad Tony Romo left, but I always have high hopes for the Cowboys.
Terrance Williams is a great wide receiver and I think the new contract was a smart move.
Jason Garrett is a great head coach - makes great decisions for the team.
Did you know that Kellen Moore is the only left-handed quarterback in the NFL?
Really - how about that?  I wonder if that has an advantages for a quarterback?
Which match up are you looking forward most this season?
I think Cowboys versus Packers will be a great game.
Yeah, I will have friends over for that game - they are die-hard Packers fans!
That will be a fun day!
Super Bowl XXX in 1995 was the last time the Cowboys won the championship - I hope they can do it again.
Me too - I will be the first in line for Super Bowl tickets!
