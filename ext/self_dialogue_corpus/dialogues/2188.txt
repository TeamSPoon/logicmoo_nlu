Who you got this year in NFL?
Honestly, not sure, it seems wide open.
Well, I certainly don't have the Bears.
Haha, no kidding, what a disaster that has turned into.
Yeah, they already have a QB controversy and they'll still be terrible.
Just a poorly managed franchise.
Yeah, they're giving the Redskins a run for their money.
Haha, very true. The Redskins missed their opportunity.
They looked fine with Cousins and should have built around him, but, now, there is all this drama.
Yeah, they always seem to have issues.
Plus, the division they're in will be brutal this year.
Yep, Giants, Eagles and Cowboys all look good.
Definitely gonna be a tough division.
Probably the toughest with the AFC South being the weakest.
Yeah, it's Titans or Texans there fighting it out for most mediocre.
Titans could be good if Mariotta stays healthy.
That's a big if though.
That's true, unfortunately. He's injury prone.
I think the Bucs made the right decision with Winston in that draft class.
Definitely true.
