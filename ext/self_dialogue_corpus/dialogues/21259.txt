What's your favorite comedy of all time?
omg tropic thunder!
mine too!
there are so many quotables in that movie...
STOP TAILING ME YOU PASTY TEABAG
THEY ONLY LOVE ME FOR MY FARTS!
i like how there's different parts of it too
...like the separate trailers?
yeah, like Simple Jack
"you mah mah mah make me haaaappy"
hahahaha yes! and the dude that's playing a dude disguised as another dude
"you're australian. be australian!"
I could seriously watch that movie forever
I actually did, probably like 6x in a weekend
yeah I really can't get tired of it
thing is, every time I watch it, I catch something that I missed before
yep, that's the sign of good writing, and how about tom cruise?
plaaaayaaaaaa

everyone does, great, great movie.
