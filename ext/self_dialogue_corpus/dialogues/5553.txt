The Princess and the Frog is an important movie.
Why do you think that?
Because it starred the first Black princess.
I love Tiana--such an ambitious character.
She's good role model for young girls, especially for young Black girls.
And boys! It's good for them to see positive representations of Black women.
Everyone likes to see themselves on screen some time, and Tiana is a great character for children to see themseleves in.
Honestly, she's a great role model for adults as well!
Good point! Maybe if I try to be like Tiana, I won't be such a disaster in the kitchen.
Maybe I'll learn to play jazz!
