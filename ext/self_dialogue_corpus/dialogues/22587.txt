What is your favorite movie ever?
I would say The Butterfly Effect
Who is the star in that film?
Ashton Kutcher.
I think I remember it
It was about a series of decisions you make and how it effects people
OK I definitely remember it, was Amy Smart in it?
Yes she was his love interest
OK and he chose paths that would affect the both of them right?
Yeah he could determine their fates
I definitely remember this movie.
It was really good for the time.
I think it still is good.
Yeah Ashton did an awesome job.
The film had so many twists
Yeah well each decision changed the plot of the movie.
I did not like when they beat up her brother though

You almost felt bad for the brother
Thats why it was so good
