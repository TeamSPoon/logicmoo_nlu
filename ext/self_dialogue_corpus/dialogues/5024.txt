Have you ever notice hour slippery a new baseball is?
No, I've never thought about it.
Last week, I was at the game and the ball boy told me they cover the baseballs with a lite coast of mud.
Really?
Yes, they cover over 500 baseballs for every game.
Why do they do this?
If they played with a fresh ball, the pitchers would not be able to pitch the way the do.
So it gives them a grip?
Yes.
I'm going tonight to see the Dodgers play the Yankees.
Awesome, if you get there early, ask around. Try to see batting practice. The players will tell you.
I will, plus it's a good give away tonight.
I read that in the paper this morning.
I know, this is the first time there are  away a dodger radio.
Did you see the game yesterday?
Yeah, I can't believe they had a team fight.
You never see that anymore.
I hear both teams for a fine.
Yup, 300,000 each team.
That's really money to pay.
