Hey, have you heard any good music lately?
Ya I usually listen to good stuff!
Who have you been listening to lately?
Mainly Rihanna. I have really been enjoying her stuff lately.
Oh wow. I never have really listened to her stuff before.
Really? I'm sure you have to have heard som eof her songs before.
Well maybe the ones that I have heard on the radio but I have never actively sought out her music.
You should really check out her albu, "A Girl like Me".
OK I will check that one out. Is that album packed with hits?
Ya that's her first album that she put out. I always thought that one was the best.
Awesome. I will be sure to get that one first.
You should check out the song Break It Off. That one was really good!
Thanks. Are there any other people that she has collaborated with?
For sure. She has worked with almost all of the big names in the business.
Like who?
She has worked with Sean Paul, Chris Brown, Little Wayne as well as a lot of others.
Wasn't she in a relationshipo with Chris Brown?
Yea she was but that turned out bad.
Oh that sucks to hear. Hopefully she is doing well now.
Ya she's doing awesome as far as we know.
