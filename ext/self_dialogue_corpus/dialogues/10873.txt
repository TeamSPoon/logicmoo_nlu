Do you like the first Fast & Furious movie?
Yes, it is my favorite.
It is my favorite as well.
What is your favorite scene?
I love when they are robbing the trucks.
Yeah, that is pretty action packed.
I think the other movies are good but the first one is the best.
I would have to agree.
I think I have seen the movie at least ten times.
I have as well.
