What movie did you watch last night?
I watched the Batman Lego movie with my grand son.
Did he like it?
Yes, he sat and watched all of it!
That is pretty good for a three year old!
He did get up and walk around during the last 10 minutes, but he enjoyed the movie.
Didn't Will Arnett do Batman's voice for that movie?
Yes, he did, and Ralph Fiennes did the voice of Alfred Pennyworth, the butler.
What villains were in the movie?
The Joker was the main villain.
Were the other villains?
Yes, the Riddler, Harley Quinn, Scarecrow, and Bane.
I thought Two-Face was also in the movie.
Yes, Two-Face was also in the movie.
Was Robin in the movie?
Yes, I felt kind of bad for Robin.
Why?
Robin gets pushed aside and left out for much of the movie.
That's too bad.
But he wins out  in the end and saves the day!
