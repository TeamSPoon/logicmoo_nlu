What type of music app do you use for you phone?
I use Google Play Music. They offer a free month trial.
Oh wow. That is so awesome!
It is a great way incentive to attract new customers.
What type of music does Google Play Music have?
They have all types of genres.
If I wanted to find an oldies classic from the 1980's, I would be able to?
Yes! You can even save your songs and create your own playlists.
That sounds really nice. I might sign up for Google Play Music.
You should. You can literally find any song that you want.
How much do you pay a month once the free trial ends?
It costs 9.99 a month but that includes access to unlimited music and artists.
Can I play the music on any type of platform?
As long as you have access to Google Play you should be able to play it on any platform.
What types of playlists do you have on your Google Play Music app?
I have all types. However, most of my playlists are rap and hip hop.
Well, I don't care for rap or hip hop but I do love Eminem.
Eminem is too old school for me. I prefer the newer artists.
Well, I might just create a playlist with some Eminem songs.
Sounds great! That is what Google Play Music is for!
