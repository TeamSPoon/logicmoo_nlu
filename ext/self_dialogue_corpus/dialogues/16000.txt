How do you feel about Alkaline Trio?
I love Matt Skiba
I have no problem with Dan either
Yeah they mesh well
I love the conflicting vocals they have
Some songs they dont blend them together
Yeah I mean Matt gets the majority of the tracks
Isnt he in Blink 182 now?
Yes but I still think the Trio will make records
Hard pulling that double duty
Well he doesnt have a family
Yeah but still you never get a day off
I think as a musician you dont mind that
Yeah but hes getting older
I loved From Here to Infirmary
I think that was the best record
Even Dan's songs were energetic
Now he seems to kind of go at the slow pace
And thats what I love about them mixing stuff up
Yeah I agree its a cool element about the band
