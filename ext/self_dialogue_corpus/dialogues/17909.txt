how did you like danger days
from my chemical romance?
yes. their last album
i did not love it to be honest
it was way too sunny
it felt so different.
it was like a different band
they should have left mcr with black parade
apparently gerard way wanted to do that
he did?
yeah, but the rest of the band wanted another album
that album ruined the gothic vibe of my chem
it wasnt as good in any way either
it was so poppy
and they wore all those weird colorful outfits
it was hard to believe
i was so disappointed to be honest
i was too
my chem were great before
yeah
