I love the Beatles' music so much.
It is timeless.
I can't think of another group so inspirational.
Yeah, they inspire all ages.
I love Hey Jude.  What is your favorite?
I am obsessed with Twist and Shout.
They don't have any bad songs.
You're right.
They also had such incredible voices and cohesion.
I love to dance to their music.
