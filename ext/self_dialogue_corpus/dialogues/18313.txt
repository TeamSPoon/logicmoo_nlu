Are you a Billy Joel fan?
Of course! I'm not sure if I know anyone who isn't.
What's your favorite song by him?
"Uptown Girl." It just puts me in such a great mood.
It puts me in a good mood too! It makes me want to dance around the house.
I just want to strut down the streets of Manhattan after listening to it.
I want to go to one of his concerts at Madison Square Garden.
Me too! I hear they're absolutely incredible.
I heard there's nothing better than hearing him singing in front of his home crowd.
I heard the exact same thing.
We should go!
Definitely. I would love to hear him sing "Piano Man" live.
That would be a dream come true for me.
I also want to hear "We Didn't Start the Fire" live.
I've tried so many times to memorize the lyrics to that song but I just could never do it.
I heard even Billy Joel forgets the lyrics to it sometimes.
Actually? That's crazy.
Yeah but it makes sense because there's just so many random events thrown one after another.
True but he was the one who wrote it.
I guess but it's also like a five minute song.
