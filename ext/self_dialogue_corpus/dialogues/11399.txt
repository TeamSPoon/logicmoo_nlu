Are you a fan of Beatles music?
Oh yeah!  John and Paul are my favorites.
They are really talented.  Whats your favorite album?
It used to be Sergeant Pepper.  I used to listen to it over and over.
And now?
Well now my tastes have changed and I prefer Abbey Road.
Oooh, love that album!  The cover is cool too and the music is awesome.
Yep, someday I want to cross Abbey Road barefoot.  I love every song.
Me too.  No bad music on that album.
You got that right.
