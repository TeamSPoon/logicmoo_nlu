I just found my collection of Disney movies at my parents house, do you want me to bring some over for the kids?
Oh, that would be so great! I appreciate it.
Of course, I'm happy to help.  My favorite was the Little Mermaid when I was young, do the kids like mermaids and princesses?
Oh yes, they are definitely in the princess stage. They love Aladdin and Princess Jasmine, if you happen to have a copy of that one too!
I think I have every Disney movie ever made. I even have some of the new ones they might not have yet!
Oh, excellent, thank you so much! They haven't seen Princess and the Frog yet, but they keep talking about it.
I have that one too! i'll add that to the pile, and it was a really good movie for little girls to watch, I think.
Perfect, I love Disney movies but I'm glad their newer ones are more focused on female empowerment.
I agree, the classic movies will always be classic, but they do seem to have more female heroes lately!
Disney is such a classic part of childhood, thanks so much for bringing over those cute musical movies!
