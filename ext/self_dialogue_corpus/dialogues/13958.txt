So how did you hear about Lady Gaga's most recent album?
Can you jog my memory? What was the name?
Sure. It was called Joanne.
Oh now I remember it came out in 2016 I think I have only heard the two singles released from that album.
Oh yes I loved those singles "Perfect Illusion" and "Million Reasons"
I first heard "Perfect Illusion" on this show she played a role in called American Horror Story. But never considered buying the full album.
I am familiar with that show. I actually purchased the single on Itunes prior to buying the album
Wow can you tell me what the album focuses on and the sound?
I definitely think it is a softer side to Lady Gaga that focuses more on family she dedicated it to her Aunt that had passed away.
Wow that is a new turn for her music which is usually rather upbeat and focused on a pop sound.
