Will Gaga ever top Bad Romance?
I though she would, I loved Judas and Born This Way
Me too but then she went and did all that jazz stuff
Yes and her latest solo album was really slow and acoustic
No dance music at all
Maybe she's sick of it or never liked it
I saw her at Coachella and she performed the old songs really well
That's nice, maybe she'll go back to her roots
I hope so
Me too but Million Reasons was sort of catchy
