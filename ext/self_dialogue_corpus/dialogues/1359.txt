What do you think was the best defense in NFL history?
I would have to say one of the Steelers 1970's teams. But, I wasn't around when those defenses played.
I would definitely agree. They had many Hall of Famers on that roster.
Jack Ham, Lambert, Mean Joe Greene. Yes, they were a great bunch.
What is the best defense you have seen since watching football.
The 2000 Baltimore Ravens and it isn't even close.
That defense was insane.
It definitely was. It was so insane that they went 5 games without scoring a touchdown, and won 3 games during that stretch.
Did they really go 3 and 2 without scoring a touchdown.
They did. I believe that was when the coaching staff made the switch at quarterback to Trent Dilfer.
Who was the quarterback in there before the switch?
Tony Banks, I believe. He was atrocious as well.
I remember him. He was pretty bad.
That offense was inept at best. Amazing that a team could have that bad of an offense and still win the Super Bowl.
Goes to show you how good that defense really was.
It wasn't a very young defense either.
No, it wasn't. Ray Lewis was a lot younger, but they had veterans all over that defense.
I was so happy to see Rod Woodson get a Super Bowl ring.
The guy had a great career and he deserved to be a part of that special team.
He definitely did. He's still a Steeler at heart, though.
