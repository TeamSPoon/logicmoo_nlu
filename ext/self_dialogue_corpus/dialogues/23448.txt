Have you seen the new james bond movie yet?
There is a new james bond movie?
Yeah! It just came out on friday!
Wow, I feel old. Who is even playing bond these days?
Thats the thing, in this one, they get all of the bonds together!
What, like time traveling?
Yeah! They team up to fight a super villain.
That seems absurd.
Its awesome!
James bond has jumped the shark.
He has you know.
Really?
Oh yes, back in the 80s, he did it with a jet ski!
Thats intense, which actor was this?
I think it might have been sean connery?
He really was the best bond, wasnt he?
Definitely, you should see him in the new film.
Im not sure I want to. Did they really get him to do it?
I am pretty sure they just made a 3d actor digital double of him. Looked too weird.
Movie magic!
