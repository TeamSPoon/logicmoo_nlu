Hey, have you heard Chance the Rapper's new song with DJ Khaled?
Yeah, the one called "I Love You So Much"? Chance has a whole verse on it that is literally just the alphabet.
I know! That's what I was going to say! It's crazy, but it sounds good. That man can make anything flow good.
I hear that! I've been so happy to watch his career grow! Especially after his latest album, Coloring Book. Have you listened to it?
Yes, I have. It's such a different sound than his earlier work. I can't decide whether I like it or not.
You mean all the gospel stuff?
Yeah, it reminds me of being in church when I was little
I think that's the point he's trying to make! Haha
I guess so! His verses are still amazing though. And the features are great. I just kind of miss Acid Rap Chance.
Me too, but artists are humans too. They grow and evolve. Chance is a daddy now. He can't be doing acid all the time any more!
