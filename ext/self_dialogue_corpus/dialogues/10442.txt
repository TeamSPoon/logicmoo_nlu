Hey man have you seen the new Alien movie yet
You mean Alien Covenant?
Yeah!  That one!
No, I haven't had a chance to yet.  I take it you have?
Absolutely!  I went opening night.
How was it?
It was amazing.  Much better than the last.
Where do you put it in the ranking of all the films?
I would probably put it at about number 3.
So what are your top 2 in the franchise
Obviously the Original followed by the 1st sequel.
I always liked Aliens better than Alien
Oh really?  Why is that?
It just had more action and was all around a better movie.
I will agree it had more action.  But I don't know about a better movie.
Well to each his own.
Very true.  If you didn't like the original, you may not like Covenant.
Why is that?
It has the eerie similarity to the original.
Oh well. I will still go see it.
