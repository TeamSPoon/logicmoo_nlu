What's up?
Nothing at all, what's going on down your side?
Same, I've been just listening to music all day.
What've you been listening to?
Old rock ballads.
Like the big hair bands from the eighties?
Exactly, I can't get enough of them.
I remember my dad used to take me around in the bed of his truck listening to them at night.
That sounds chill.
It was, it was always really fun and relaxing.
What was your favorite song?
I think Bed of Roses, by Jon Bon Jovi?
That's a good hit, I almost forgot about it.
What was yours?
Carrie, by Europe. I think all those old ballads are just so chilling.
They really are; I get chills every time I hear one.
Especially 'When the Children cry'.
Oh, yes! Who is that by, again?
White Lion, they were so good.
Yeah they were.
