have you ever seen Lady Gaga in concert?
yeah, I've seen her three times!
how was it?
it was amazing! I had a blast.
wow, I am so jealous.
she sounds even better in person than she does on her albums.
What was the audience like?
everyone was really into it.
I hope I can see her live some day!
it was so totally worth it.
