Hey did you see the trailer for that new movie about emojis ?
Yeah. It looks kind of weird. Like it will be forgotten as a movie pretty soon
That's doesn't mean it will be awful. Aren't there any obscure movies you like?
There is a few. Have you heard of I Married an Ax Murderer?
No. Is it a good show ?
One of the best I've seen. Do you have any you'd like to share ?
Maybe Odd Thomas. It's dark but funny.
I liked that show! Did you see the one with the last Anton yelchon, Charlie Bartlet!
I have not. Is it a sad show ?
No it's a comedy. It is really clever.
I would like to see it. Have you ever seen Nick and Nora's infinite playlist ?
Yes! They are very similar !
I like a lot of films like that. In a weird way, Zach and Mira make a Porno is similar.
Is it a bad movie ?
No its juts silly. But very funny.
Do you like Superbad? It's silly and funny.
Loved that. And Adventureland, kind of similar.
I seen that I really enjoyed it. Do you think it is better than Superbad?
No way. Superbad is Superiour.
I agree. Are there any others?
