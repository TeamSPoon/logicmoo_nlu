So what do you think about video game movies?
I've never really seen any, so I'm not sure I can really give an opinion on them.
That's good. Trust me when I say that you're not missing out on much.
Are they that bad?
Yeah, they're pretty awful.
What are some examples?
Off the top of my head, there's the Super Mario Bros. movie.
Okay, that already sounds silly.
It is. Mario and Luigi are two Italian immigrants living in a dystopian city, and the goombas are essentially dinosaur people.
What? Now that sounds just plain bad.
There's also the Mortal Kombat movie series.
Series? There was more than one?
Yes, and one was bad enough. Laughable costumes, cheesy acting, and absolutely awful special effects.
You're really not giving me much to look forward to.
Like I said, you're not missing out on much.
You'd think that they would just go off of the stories in video games.
Yeah, but they don't. They always try to change it up.
Seems typical for Hollywood.
To always try to change something to fit the ideas of directors and producers instead of the source material?
Yes, this exactly.
