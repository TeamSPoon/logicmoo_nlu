Did you catch the latest Star Wars movie?
which one, the Force Awakens or Rogue One?
Rogue One
I haven't seen that one yet, I did see Force Awakens
What did you think of Force Awakens?
I thought it was okay, not as good as the original ones
Yeah, it was kind of a mash-up of the original three movies
Yeah, there wasn't much of a new story line
And Carrie Fisher was really bad in it
Yeah, her acting has gone way down, hasn't it?
Yeah, it's too bad because she was really good in the original ones
Oh, do you remember her in Blues Brothers?
Oh yeah, she was Elroy's estranged wife?
I think so, I just remember her shooting the machine gun at them at one point
Yeah, that was a classic moment
Well, anyway, at least the Force Awakens was better than the prequels
Oh man those were horrible
Yeah, really bad
You should check out Rogue one; it's good
Okay I'll try checking it out, thanks.
