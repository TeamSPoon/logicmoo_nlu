Do you remember the Evil Dead series?
Those campy B rated horror movies, yes, they were fantastic.
Yeah, and then the army of Darkness sequal.
Bruce Campbell was the best, with his chainsaw hand.
"This is my boomstick" is one of his best lines.
As goofy as they were, they scared me a lot.
Well, thats what made the goofyness of them so much fun, cause you'd go from laughting to screaming.
I used to watch them under a blanket.
Me too, I feel like renting Army of Darkness now and watching it.  Wanna join me?
Yeah, I could use a good scare.
