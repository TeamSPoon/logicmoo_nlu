I cannot stand pop music it is so bland
I mean i can sort of agree it is not the most inspiring thing to exist and is a little bland.
It has never been good since it came around to be frank
I can sorta disagree it is not good now adays though
No it always has been
In the past it was good though
What do you mean that synth pop stuff in the old days
Yeah that stuff was good and not that bad,
Nah i found it to be horrible to listen to
I actually quite loved it
It is actually worse than modern stuff in my eyes
Gotta be less harsh on it it is actually very catchy
Catchy does not equate good though.
well not but it does help
no way to me it makes it worse
Well i guess we gotta agree to disagree
I am still suprised you like any pop you do not strike me as that person
I have a diverse taste i like a lot of music
Well i guess you are right their for sure.
Well maybe we can get you into some new music one day!
