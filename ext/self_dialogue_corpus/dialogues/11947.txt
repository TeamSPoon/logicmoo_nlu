I'm looking to buy a CD for my dad's birthday. What do you think I should get?
Get him a Beatles CD.
Do you really think he will like that?
Of course! Everyone his age would. They were legends back in the day.
Great idea! I actually like them too.
I like them, but I can't say I really know much of their music.
You must know at least Hey Jude.
Yea, I think everybody knows that one!
True. In any case, my father will know all!
All of his baby-boomer friends will want to borrow his CD!
