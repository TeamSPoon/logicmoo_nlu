What is one of your favorite Disney movies?
I have to say Beauty and the Beast.
That movie is a classic.
Who is your favorite character from that movie?
I really like Lumiere.
Yes, he is quite charming.
My favorite villain is Gaston.
I know, I love how he has such a big ego.
Gaston would probably be an attractive person in real life.
I have to say the real life action movie was well cast for Gaston!
