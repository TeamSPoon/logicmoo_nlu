Ever seen the mvie Dispicable Me?
Yes, I love that movie.
Not your typical villian.
No certainly not.
I love how the three girls just end up wrappinghim around their finger.
He becomes so incredibly caring with them.
He writes them stories and does the ballet.
Only after a while.
The minions also make it so special.
I would think I would have hated them but I thought they were so funny.
I liked the sub plot of always trying to please a parent.
He steals the planet and she is still not proud.
they all need something from one another.
That all works out in the end.
He is so much bigger then the smallest girl
you can see him as her protector both physically and emothionally.
They were lucky to have found eachother.
Very lucky.
Not everyone is so loved and accepted as they are with one another.
Part of what makes it so great.
