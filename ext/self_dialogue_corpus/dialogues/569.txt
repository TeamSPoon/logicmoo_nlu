Who do you think is the best NFL franchise?
That's a tough one.  Who's your favorite?
I would say the Patriots.
They have been good for the last few years, but not all time.
So who do you pick?
I would go with the Steelers.
They are always a good team.
That's why I would say they are the best franchise.
Did you know the Steelers have only had 3 coaches since 1969?
Yeah, Chuck Noll, Bill Cower, and Mike Tomlin.
That is super rare for a franchise to have a coach that long.
I would also say the Cowboys are an all time great franchise.
The Cowboys haven't been good for years.
The Cowboys are good but they are not Super Bowl good.
I guess that is fair.
I would say for the history of the NFL it's got to be the Steelers.
How many championships have the Steelers won?
The Steelers have won 6 Super Bowls.
Who's won the most Super Bowls as a team?
It's the Steelers with 6.  The Patriots have 5.
