Have you watched the Lions lately?
I have.  They honestly aren't that good.  I miss the days when Barry Sanders played.
He was a football legend!  What players do you like?
I don't really like any of the Lions players, though Johnson did okay.
He's pretty good.  I like some of the guys on the other teams.  Tom Brady is pretty amazing.
He is excellent. Didn't he play for University of Michigan before he went pro?
Yes he did.  How do you feel about the Manning brothers?
I think Eli is obviously better.
What team is your favorite?
I love the cowboys!  You?
I have to support the Lions because I'm from Michigan, but I also love the Patriots....Brady is the man!
Who would you like to see in the superbowl?  Like what would be your dream match?
Hmmm..I'd love to see the Lions finally make the superbowl for once!  I don't care who they play!
Lions have never played in a superbowl.
I know!  I wish they could just get it together and play well enough to have the chance at a superbowl title.
I doubt that will ever happen.  Lions are too inconsistent!
Who would you want to see?
I have to have my cowboys.  I'd like to see them beat the Lions!  It would be  a sure bet that the Cowboys would beat Detroit Lions!
If you say so!  Lions sometimes surprise me and they have beat the Cowboys in the past!
True.
