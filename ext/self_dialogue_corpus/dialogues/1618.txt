The Jets are going to be so bad this year!
Worse than the Browns last year?
Yeah, definitely.
Why do you think that?
They have no quarterback!
They have Mccown!
Who was the quarterback of the horrible Browns!
That is true I suppose.
On top of that they have gutted their entire team.
Who did they lose for this season.
Well, first off Revis.
He was getting old anyway.
Yeah but he still had the smarts at least.
Yeah, I guess. I think he was only in it for the money.
Duh! But then again most players are.
Yeah.  Who else is gone?
Mangold was so good for them for so long and he is gone too.
Oh man, that is a shame!
Yeah, this season is going to suck. Being a Jets fan is difficult.
You've got that right!
