Do you know how the Dodgers are doing this year?
They got off to a slow start, but they're slowly gaining momentum in the NL West.
They had the Rookie of the Year last year, didn't they?
Yeah, Corey Seager. And they have another bright prospect making news this year.
Is he any good or just a flash in the pan?
Yeah, he's tearing up the place... there's no way they're going to send him back to the minors now.
What's this rookie's name?
Cody Bellinger, and he's in line to replace Adrian Gonzalez at first base.
The kid must be really good to replace Gonzalez... what's he been doing lately?
He has five home runs in those 11 games, and just hit a grand slam against the Padres.
That's incredible! Do you think he's a Rookie of the Year candidate?
Most definitely. The Dodgers have a history of cranking out Rookies of the Year.
I remember in the 1990s they had five in a row.
Yeah, one of them was Mike Piazza, who just got elected to the Hall of Fame last year.
This could be the start of another streak for the Dodgers rookies.
No doubt... people criticize the team for buying high priced talent, but they've got quite a few farm players in their line up.
Anyone I've heard of?
Joc Pedersen, Yasiel Puig, and Corey Seager are all everyday players, not to mention Clayton Kershaw.
Kershaw is a pitching machine, isn't he?
No doubt... he'll lead the Dodgers to the World Series within the next three years.
