hey do you know when the new incredibles is coming out
no, i really dont think they will make one
i know it has been a while but im still hopeful
the first one came out so long ago, i doubt a second one is coming
true but how the first one ended it set up a sequel
that is a good point, but dont you think it would of been made  by now?
Yeah, but sometimes you have to wait for the really good ones
Talk about really waiting, because it has been ten plus years
Well i am going to keep the hope alive and ill message disney myself
good luck with that and let me know how it goes
