Do you know of any good new music?
There's a lot of new music out right now. What genres do you like?
I'm really into anything electronic.
Do you mean techno? Or are you into the more hip-hop stuff.
I'm not really into techno or house. I like the hip-hop style.
You might like Cashmere Cat then.
What's do they sound like?
It's like really calm hip-hop music. It's very stylistic.
That sounds right up my alley.
He has done some beats with The Weeknd and Kanye West.
That's awesome. I'm surprised I haven't heard of him before.
He's not very well known yet. I think he will be, though.
What song should I listen to by him?
Listen to his song called "Adore" with Ariana Grande. It's good.
Okay I will do that. Are there any other artists you could recommend?
Sure, Jai Wolf is another artist that does a similar style.
I think I have heard that name before.
He's pretty well known. He is touring a lot right now.
Awesome. Is there a song I should listen to by him?
"Indian Summer" is by far my favorite track that he has.
