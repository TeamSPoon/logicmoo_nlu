Hey, who are you most looking forward to seeing play this year?
I think this might be the Cowboys year
Really? It seems like they always figure out how to screw it up.
That is true, but they have all the pieces in place. I wish they would stop blowing draft picks on thug players though.
Yeah, Greg Hardy was a disaster of a pick - and to take him so early could be a disaster. They've gotten through it though before.
They are getting around him with their most recent draft pick too.
Very true. It'll be interesting to see what the Patriots do too.
Yeah, like most Americans, I'm pretty sick of them winning every year. I think it's become a thing to cheer against them.
I certainly do that as well. The lack of interest in watching the same teams win over and over is real.
I am very interested in seeing the new teams and the relocation teams though.
Yeah - I was shocked that the Raiders are actually moving to Vegas and the two teams playing in Los Angeles.
I don't see the two in LA as a feasible thing forever. I don't like that and I'm sure they don't either.
But there are the two teams that play in "New York" - but actually play in New Jersey
That's true, they share a stadium and such, but the Jets aren't good.
That's also true, but the Rams haven't been good for a very long time either. The Chargers aren't good either right now.
The Vegas move shocked me because they have one of the most reputable fan bases in the world.
Yeah, Vegas just got a hockey team too, so I'm not really sure what is so big about Vegas, the city doesn't impress me that much.
I suppose it is good for the Raiders, because they will sell out every game with tourists from elsewhere, but they do abandon one of the most blueblood fan bases and loyal fanbases too!
I guess we'll have to see what happens when it happens.
Very true. Can't wait.
