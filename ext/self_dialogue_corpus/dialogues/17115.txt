do you like the beatles
i do but im not a huge fan
you cant deny their influence
they are the most influential band of all time
they really are
every band was inspired by them
they did a lot for music
they experimented a lot
sgt pepper was my favorite
i liked revolver better
that was their most psychadelic album, right
yeah, pretty much
sgt pepper was so good with their concept though
thats a huge album
its a lot of peoples favorites
revolver is a bit underrated
they are both good though
every beatles album is pretty good
yeah that is true
yup
