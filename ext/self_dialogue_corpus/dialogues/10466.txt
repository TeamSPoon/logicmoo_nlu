Hey, what's going on?
Oh, not much. What are you up to?
Nothing much. I was thinking about maybe going out tonight.
Oh, really? Do you mean like a movie or something?
Yeah. I was thinking about going to a movie because everyone else went to that concert.
What were you thinking of seeing?
I don't know. I'm not really sure what's out.
Yeah, I haven't seen anything lately. I hear that Aliens movie is supposed to be good.
Oh, really? Which one is that?
That's that one that's based on an old movie with Sigourney Weaver.
I never heard of it.
Well, I'll avoid spoiling anything for you.
I appreciate it. You could tell me a little about the old one I guess.
Well, basically they're on a spaceship and they find out there's an alien on it.
That's it?
It's actually full of suspense, drama and action, though.
Do they just fight the alien the whole time or something?
It was more complex than that. Without giving too much away, there's a bit of mystery involved with finding out about the alien.
Oh, wait. Was that the one where an alien pops out of someone's stomach or something like that?
Exactly. It was really well done and really drew the viewer into the experience of being on the spaceship.
