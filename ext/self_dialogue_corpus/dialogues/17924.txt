Hey, Maxwell, I have a music question for you.
Ok, Enrique, let's hear it.
Who is your favorite member of the Beatles?
Wow, that's a good question.  I love the Beatles.
I know you do, that's why I asked you!
Well, I know that most people would vote for either John or Paul, but not me.
Don't tell me that Ringo is your favorite!
Ha, ha, of course not.  Don't be silly!
Whew, you dodged a bullet there! So your favorite is George?
Yeah, good old George Harrison.
Why do you choose George?
Well, I just appreciate George's attitude.
What do you mean?
He was a brilliant guitar player, and an excellent song writer, but he kinda stepped back and didn't interfere with the chemistry of the band.
Interesting thought there, I do enjoy listening to his guitar work.
Same here, he also has a pretty good singing voice.
Did he sing much with the Beatles?
He sang some, but again Paul and John got most of the attention. You should listen to some of his solo work.
I will have to check it out.  Thanks for the answers!
You're welcome, enjoy some George Harrison today!
