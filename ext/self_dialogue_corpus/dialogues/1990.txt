Which team do you think is going to be the surprise team this year?
There are a lot to choose from but I would have to say Tampa Bay.
They do have a lot of good young players.
Yeah I think Winston is going to be hitting his prime this year.
He has Evans to throw to as well, plus didn't they add a new receiver?
Yeah they got DeSean Jackson this offseason.
That should help Evens get open more for sure.
Plus they drafted OJ Howard, he should be a big target.
They need to find a better running back though.
They still have Doug Martin.
He's suspended for the first four games though.
Yeah but maybe he'll come back rested and ready to go.
Think Houston is going to be a lot better?
If they get good play out of Savage maybe.
They have that great defense and a few big pieces on offense as well.
JJ Watt being back should make that defense even more scary.
Yeah if they can score 20 or more points a game they should be ok.
They are probably going to give the Colts a run for their money.
Don't count out Andrew Luck though, he's been pretty good ever since he got into the league.
He's good for sure but it might not matter if he's being sacked four times a game.
