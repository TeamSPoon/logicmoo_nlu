What do you think of Green Day?
One of the most important groups from the 90's.
Yeah I grew up listening to them.
One of my favorite songs from them was Boulevard of Broken Dreams.
Yeah, that's one of my break up songs.
Yeah, it is a little depressing but It's also good that it has that alone feeling to it.
Yeah, it kind of helps in a way.
What about Wake me up When September Ends.
Good song. Nice rock ballad.
Some of their fast stuff is good too like American Idiot.
Yeah I like that one.  Basketcase too was really good.
You know they started in like the 80's.
No way?
Yeah 1989.
Wow, that was a long time ago.
Yep.  1000 hours was in 1989.
Crazy.
Another good rock ballad by them.  Time of your life.
Yes!  Good wedding song too.
Yeah, I've seen it used like that.
