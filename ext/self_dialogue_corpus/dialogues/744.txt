I just read that the NFL cheerleaders only get paid $150 per game.
Seriously?
Yup, that's crazy.
$150 per day? I'll take that.
It's a really small amount of money. Times that by 16 games and it's barely above $2000, pre-tax.
Multiply.
Huh?
Times is not a verb. Multiply is.
Oh shut up. What do you think about the wages?
I think they're completely fair yet unfair.
Like how?
It's fair because no one notices the cheerleaders anyway. They are paid $150 to look pretty.
Yeah they don't lead cheers, do they?
I know they put a ton of time into it, and I think they have to pay for their own uniforms, too.
Do you have a solution?
Of course! I am wise beyond your years.
Tell me.
Pay them $1,000 per game. That's $16,000 per year.
That's a lot!
Pay the concessions people the same, too. It's nothing when compared to the insanely overpaid players. $1 million less from the team salary is unnoticeable, but would greatly improve others' llives.
