What sort of idea do you have
Well i have an idea for a comedy movie
Well is it a good idea
Yeah it is a pretty amazing idea
Well lay it on me
My idea is that we should mix stand up with a movie and make it intermix
So sorta like seinfeld
More than that
Like how
Like make it a regular thing between going back and forth not just at the start of the movie would be a brilliant comedy.
