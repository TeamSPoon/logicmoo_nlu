Did you know they are making a Toy Story 4?
Really? I thought they were finished with just only three movies for a trilogy.
Yeah it comes out in 2019.
Wow. I can't believe they are.
I am a little excited to see it cause they are gonna try to find Bo Peep.
That is kind of cool but I just don't know if I want to see it.
How come?
Well I feel like the series ended on a good note and there is nothing more needing to be said.
Well yeah it is cool Andy gave them a good home and all but that doesn't mean their adventures have to end.
True I suppose you are right.
