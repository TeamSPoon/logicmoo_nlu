Have you heard Harry Styles new song?
No, how is it?
I just don't like it.
Really?
Yeah, his voice is good but the song is not.  Just not for me, I guess.
Have you heard Liam Payne's new song?
Yes, it is bad too.
I know, they were much better as a group than individuals.
I agree
Liam's song is so recycled ideas, it is not original at all.
