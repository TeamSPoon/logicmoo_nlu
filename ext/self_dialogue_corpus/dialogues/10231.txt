Do you think bruce willis is a good actor
he is good in action movies
I think he is pretty meh in every other role
I mean he does play the action role perfectly
I have not seen anyone perform it as good
I know right
I honestly wish he would do more movies
It would be pretty cool
Maybe he can do with a good role
It would be nice
