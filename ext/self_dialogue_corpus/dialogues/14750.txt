Have you seen any good comedies lately?
Yeah. I finally got around to seeing Knocked Up.
I've never heard of that one. Who's in it?
The main characters are played by Seth Rogen and Katherine Heigl.
Oh. Seth Rogen is the guy that played in Pineapple Express, right?
That's right. He's pretty funny.
He's been in quite a few movies with James Franco.
I think the best one they starred in together was This Is the End where they basically parodied themselves.
That one was so funny. It was cool to see all the cameos in that movie.
I know. I thought it was hilarious when Rihanna slapped Michael Cera across the face after he touched her butt.
