Did you see the last Spurs game against the Warriors?
Yeah I did, do you think that the Spurs are going to go on to the next round?
I really hope so, the Spurs are my team but it seems like they can never beat the warriors!
Yeah I know it, especially since Tony Parker is out for the rest of the playoffs.
Last year in the playoffs the Spurs put up a good fight but they just couldn't get past those warriors
Last year they had Tony Parker and Tim Duncan playing in the playoffs and they couldnt beat the warriors.
I was at work last night so I couldnt catch that game, was Kawai in the game?
No he didnt play, hes still out, I even heard that hell be out for this whole round in the playoffs!
What, they are going to keep him out for that long!
Thats what I read this morning, I guess ankle injuries are pretty serious so it would be easy to do further damage if he plays too soon.
Oh my gosh thats terrible! What are they going to do without Tony and Kawai?
So I guess you didnt hear about David Lee either?
No I didn't what happened to Lee?
Well he fell in the first quarter and injured his knee, it looks like he will be out for a while too!
So this means we have lost to the Warriors three times in a row, if we lose one more time we are out of the finals!
Thats right, and the past two games they've beat us pretty bad, 100-136 and 108-120.
The first game wasn't so bad, I think we only lost by two points.
Your right but we had Kawai was in that first game up until the third quarter.
I read that Zaza Pachulia from the warriors purposefully slid his foot under Kawais foot to make him fall and injure him.
I heard the same thing too but I hope that its not true, talk about bad karma!
