Are you still a rap fan?
Yes but not any of the new stuff. Classic hip hop all the way.
Why?
It's just not as good now, the lyrics are all the same, the MCs all dress the same.
I remember you used to love Eve, LLCool J, Dre
Yeah still do. Eve and Ja Rule were the bomb, they still tour
Have you been
Yep I say Ashanti, Eve, Ja Rule in Philly last year.
That's good, shame you don't like the quality now.
There's a really small few like Common that still have a message.
