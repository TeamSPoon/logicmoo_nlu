I'm tired today because I was up late last night looking online for ideas on what to buy some of the people on my Christmas shopping list.
I pretty much know what I'm getting everyone. Who were you shopping for?
One of the hard ones is my seven year old niece. She's the only niece I have, so I like to get her something special.
I have a ten year old niece, and I already ordered some great stuff for her on Amazon.
What did you buy?
She loves that Disney movie Finding Nemo, so I ordered this cute Finding Nemo blanket, and some stuffed animals, Nemo and Dory.
Oh. That's a great idea. My niece loves the Disney movie Frozen, I bet I could find some Frozen stuff like that.
You could probably find Frozen clothing and costumes too, she would probably like a Frozen nightgown or something.
That's an awesome idea! You just made my shopping a lot easier.
No problem, you know how I LOVE online shopping!
