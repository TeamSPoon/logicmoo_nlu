Aren't you a great fan of Chris Hemsworth?
Yes and so are you!
Well, good news for us. His new movie Thor: Ragnarok releases in October 2017.
That's great. In time for your autumn break.
You haven't heard it all. From what I read, he is sharing screenspace with Hulk.
I'm not much of a fan of Hulk.
I don't mind him, but Thor is Thor!
True that. I cannot wait for October and the movie to be released in movie halls.
Can you put a reminder in your calendar to book tickets for the movie?
Consider it done. There is still time for the release and I'm getting all excited right now.
