Do you listen to edm?
Is that a band?
No, electronic dance music.
Oh, you mean the kind of thing they play at raves and whatnot?
Yup.
Not really but Im not that familiar with it.
I used to be unfamiliar but I've been listening to it more recently and its growing on me.
Really, are you going to clubs or something?
Not really, but that's what kicked off my listening to it more.
So you heard it at a club and liked it and decided to explore it more on your own?
Yup.  And its better than I thought.
Do you listen to, what are they bands or djs or?
Its a bit of both as far as I can tell.
What's the difference?
Im not totally sure yet in terms of the music.  I think DJs are more the live stuff that combines and mixes music made by others.
Maybe we should go to a club together.  I wouldnt  mind learning more about edm.
Sure man, any time.
This weekend I saw there is some big DJ playing t this club downtown.
Well I'm game.  Get the details and we'll go.
Will do.  EDM here I come.
