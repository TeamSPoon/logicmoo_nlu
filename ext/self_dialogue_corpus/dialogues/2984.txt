Do you think the jets will play.500 ball this year?
I don't think they'll win 5 games.
You think they're that bad?
I know they are.
Who's the starting quarterback?
I don't believe they even know.
Do you think josh McGowan will start?
I don't know.
He has the most experience.
That's about all he has.
Yea,he's a journeyman.
To say the least.
Do you think Bryce petty will be any good?
It's possible he can turn out ok.
Bad organization to start your career with.
I don't understand why they released Brandon Marshall.
He was their number one receiver.
The Giants snatched him quickly.
He'll do well with the Giants.
I think so too
