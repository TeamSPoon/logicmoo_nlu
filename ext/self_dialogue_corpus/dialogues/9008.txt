So what is your favorite rock band?
I think my favorite has always been the Eagles.
Yeah, I always liked them too.
I was so heartbroken when Glenn Frey died.
I know, I loved his voice. I really liked his song Boys of Summer.
Oh yeah, that was a great one.
It just want be the same without him in the group.
I know, but I heard they are recruiting his son Deacon Frey to sing in his place.
That would be awesome. I heard he sounds just like his dad.
He does, I've heard him sing. He is awesome.
