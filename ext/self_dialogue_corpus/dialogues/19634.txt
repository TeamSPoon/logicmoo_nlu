Morning.
Hi.
What's happening?
Not too much today.  How about yourself?
Yeah same here.
What are we supposed to be doing?
We're supposed to talk about music.
Oh okay.
Whose a band you liked when you were growing up?
That's a good question.
Take your time.
Don't judge me but I liked Hanson a lot when I was a kid.
Haha that's great.
Yeah well...
I'm serious that takes me back.
What about you?
I like nirvana a lot, pearl jam.  A lot of grunge.
Oh you must be older.
Yeah I guess I have dated myself with that.
Not too much older than me.
