What do you think of the new movie coming up, War for the Planet of the Apes?
I am very excited for it! I love the Planet of the Apes!
Me too, it definitely looks like a great summer movie.
I love how they can always come up with new story lines for this movie.
The creators are so smart with making the apes more civilized.
I completely agree! I can't wait for it to come out.
What about Logan? Did you get a chance to see it?
No I didn't! I wish I did though, was it good?
It was amazing! I always love the X-Men series.  Logan is definitely one of my favorite science fictions.
Now I definitely need to go see it!
Hugh Jackman never ceases to impress.  The other characters were very good as well, and so much action packed.
Really? I love a great action movie.  I'll check it out tonight in my Apple TV.  You've convinced me!
What about the new Guardians of the Galaxy? Did you see that one?
I did see it! Did you get a chance?
Uh yes...I wouldn't miss it even if my life depended on it!
It was to die-for! Chris Pratt is becoming one of my favorites.
Me too! I really liked the other characters as well.
They all did fantastic! So much action, I was at the edge of my seat.
I'm going to pick up my copy in blu-ray when it comes out.
I'll be counting down the days.
