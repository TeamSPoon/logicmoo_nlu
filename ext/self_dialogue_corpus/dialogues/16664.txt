Have you heard of Postmodern Jukebox?
No, what is that?
It's a group that got famous on YouTube. They take current music and re-do it in the style of older styles.
Sounds like something they'd have at a hipster restaurant
Yeah, they seem to be obnoxiously self-loving in their videos.
I can't stand that. Do they make it work, though?
Their music rocks. They always have seamless blending. It's just a matter of who is performing.
Do you listen to anyone else on YouTube?
Of course. I love Malinda Kathleen Reece.
Who is that?
She's the one who does the "Google Translate" series.
What's that?
She takes songs and puts them through several layers of Google Translate, then sings the results.
Ha, that sounds odd.
Yeah, but somehow she makes it work. She speeds up and slows down to make up for it.
Sounds like it gets funny. How often does she write music?
She'll upload once a week with a translate or a cover.
DIdn't she do that Frozen song?
Yup, that's her!
That was fun, but seems like it'll get old after a while.
