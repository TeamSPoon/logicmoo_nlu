Did you ever see Shawshank Redemption?
Yes, it was my all time favorite.
That movie has so many good scenes in it.
Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman both do a great job in it.
Was that based on a true story?
No, but it is based off of a Stephen King book, you should read it.
Side characters are great in it too/
Yeah, I always felt bad for the old guy Brooks,
Imagine being in prison for over 50 and havign to adjust to normal life again?
No, i definitely couldnt.
The young kid and the warden are interesting characters too.
Agreed, I remember thinking that Dufraine may actually get proven innocent and get released
And then the warden gets the young kid killed.
BUt at least that leads to the escape scene.
Yeah, crazy how the guy has a hole in his cell wall and no one ever notices.
Yeah, coudl you imiagine havign to crawl through a mile of sewage?
Not at all, but I like how he creates a whole new identity and gets the warden busted.
Yeah great endiing to when Red and Dufraine meet at the beach in Mexico.
THat was, great to see things work out well for both.
Definitely would watch that movie again anytime.
