Okay, who is your favorite Country music star?
Well, for me I would have to be Carrie Underwood.
Okay, any particular reasons why.
Well, she's beautiful and she has a excellent voice.
Okay, what's you favorite song by her?
That would have to be Blown Away, though Church Bells is a close second.
Those are very good songs, and both have great music videos
Yes, but now its your turn, who is your favorite Country music star?
For me, that would be Trace Atkins.
OKay, he's good, but what do you like in particular?
Well, his songs are fun and sometimes even funny as well.
Could you give me a for instance.
How about Brown Chicken, Brown Cow?
I haven't heard that one, what's it about.
The title is a pun on the phrase "Bow chick wow wow" and is about the activities of a farmer and his hot girlfriend in the farmer barn., as seen by the farm animals
Okay, now I get it. It does sound funny.
Yes, and the music video features both muppet style farm animals and even a muppet version of Trace.
A muppet Trace Atkins?
Yes, complete with black cowboy hat and black shirt.
Okay, I might give that one a gander later. Nice talking with you.
