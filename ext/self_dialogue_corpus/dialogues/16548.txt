Do you like Kelly clarkson?
Yes I love her
I watched her when she was on American idol
Me too i voted for her so much.
I was happy she won
Did you like that song she sang with reba
Yes it was amazing.
I wished they would do something else like that.
She has so much talent, but in her cd all the songs sounded alike.
I know, I don't know why she didn't show all she could do on her album.
That's probably why you don't hear much from her anymore.
I think so
Do you watch the voice
Yea I love it.  I heard they were bringing American Idol back.
That should be interesting.
Yes, I wonder who the judges will be.
Maybe they will be the same.
It's possible. I didnt love Simon though
I dont think anyone does.
No i dont think so.
