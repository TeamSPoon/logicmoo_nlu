Who do you think is the best QB in NFL history?
Oh thats a tough one.
I would say its got to be Tom brady.
No way, there have to be so many more that are better
Like who? Brady has so many rings, so many awards.
Montana, Elway, Kelly, Marino just to name a few.
Marino? you're nuts he never even won a superbowl.
Is that the measure? Because statistically hes one of the best.
Well that has to be part of the conversation. If you can't win a championship how good are you?
Ok, lets exclude Marino, Then who?
Well Elway won a couple superbowls, so did Montana.
Ok, I'll agree with you that those are top level QBs and certainly among the elite but not better than Brady.
They were dominant as passers in a league that favored running. Put them in the league now and they are at the top.
Yeah but so is brady. No other QB has done more with less.
Less? Brady has had elite talent all career. Moss, Welker are all unbelievable recievers.
Well then Montana had Rice. Who you cant dispute is the best Reciever of all time.
Fair, But you could plug anyone into the New England system and they could have success
Oh youre just out of your mind now its not even worth arguing.
I'm telling you, Brady retires then the next guy is almost as good.
I suppose we will find out soon.
