Which disney film has the best musical score?
I say Aladdin. there is gotta have a friend like me, whole new world.
Whole new world is such a good one. I love singing along to it.
I also really loved the opening market song in Aladdin. So entertaining.
Aladdin is a good call, but I think Lion King had a stronger soundtrack.
I do also think that is a top choice.  Circle of life is amazing.
It is so deep when you think of the message, and so very true.
Lion king was incredible for so many reasons. Original story as well.
Musically it is my favorite. Can you feel the love tonight won an oscar even.
Elton john is a pro. Disney was so wise having him in on this film.
