Hey bro! Ready for the season?
Yeah I am!  The Eagles are looking good this year.
Yeah they are, we made some good pick ups this year.
Yes sir, I'm excited to see how Alshon Jeffrey does.
Me too man, between him, Jordan Matthews, and Green-Beckham, I think we're looking solid.
Can't argue with that, our Running backs are looking pretty good too.
You're not lying, Darren Sproles is a little beast for his age.
What do you mean for his age?  He's a top 10 running back in the whole league.
Alright, I guess you're right.
You know what was most surprising to me?
What?
That we picked up Foles again.
Really?  I didn't see that, when did that happen?
In March man! How'd you miss that?
I have no idea.
Get with the program man, he's probably going to move in front of Daniels.
That's not saying much, I don't think we'll need anyone besides Wentz.
He's definitely the best QB we've had in years.
Yep, every since good old Donovan Mcnabb.
The greatest Eagles QB of our time.
