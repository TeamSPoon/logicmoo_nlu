I was looking for a  movie to watch and I remembered  Flight of the Navigator. I loved that movie1
So much fun to watch. Makes you wish you could fly that ship!
Heck yeah it does! Even as an adult I still get lost in that movie like a little kid.
There are quite a few famous people in it as I recall.
It is a Disney movie and how they made it for  9 million is unbelievable considering the cast.
Well think about it that some of the famous people weren't but kids then so they didn't have to pay them much.
That's true. Like Sarah Jessica Parker and a few "B" rate actors like Cliff DeYoung and Howard Hessman.
Howard Hesseman  he's Johnny Fever from WKRP in Cincinnati  tv show!
Paul Reubens  is in it too.
I love Pee Wee Herman!
It seems like he played an alien in this movie but I could be wrong.
The space ship the kid flies is so cool because it looks like liquid metal.
The ships navigation helper is hilarious caling him Davie.
Angela Cartwright plays his frantic mother.
No it's Veronica Cartwright her sister that plays his mother.
Your "WRIGHT" (ha ha ) Angela Cartwright played Penny in "Lost in Space" tv series.
I guess I need to school you in your "b" rate movie actors.
For sure you never know when it make come in handy at trivia night.
Take care I'll see you tomorrow.
May the farce be with you..
