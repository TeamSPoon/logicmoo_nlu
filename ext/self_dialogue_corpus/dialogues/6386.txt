Have you seen the movie Cinderella?
The Disney one?
Yes! It is my favorite.
I watched it as a kid, but not recently. I remember loving it!
I just watched it with my niece and I forgot how much I loved the little mouse, Gus Gus.
Oh yeah! He was very cute! When I was a kid I named my dog Gus Gus.
That is so funny! I had a cat named after Malifecent from Sleeping Beauty.
Awe! Was he a mean cat?
He could be a bit grumpy at times!
Well at least the name fits!
