Did you see that Beauty and the beast is now out on Blueray and DVD?
Yes, I can't wait to see it again!
Did you see it in the theater?
I did and it was amazing!
My family just watched it the other night. It was my first time seeing it.
What did you think?
I thought it was very good.
What did you think about the actress who played Belle?
I thought she was wonderful. It was nice to see a more down-to-earth Disney princess for a change.
I felt exactly the same. Belle was my favorite character in the movie.
