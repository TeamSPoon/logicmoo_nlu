What movie won Best Oscar last year?
Oh, it was that movie about the guy growing up.
That's not helpful enough.  Remember anything else?
He was homosexual, African-American...
Oh, Moonlight.
Yeah, that's it.
I watched it the other day on an airplane.  It was okay, but seemed just that.
It was an interesting character study for sure.  Certain parts were stronger than others.
Agreed.  I liked the first part when he was a child.
Where he befriended the drug dealer?
Right.  To me, that was the emotional core of the film.
I also thought it was the best part.
It really introduced the problems he would encounter later in life.
It did, though it was kind of disappointing that the best part was in the beginning.
The ending was somewhat ineffective to me.
It didn't match the same pace that he did as a child or at school.
Yeah, way too much talking.
Especially in the diner.  It just felt the air was let out of it a bit.
I actually think it's a movie that would have been better being told in reverse.
Hey, that's a very interesting idea.
