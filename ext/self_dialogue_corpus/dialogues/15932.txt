Do you know Bryan Adams?
Do I know him? I'm a huge fan!
Have you seen him live?
No, just from his in-studio albums.
Does he still tour?
I don't know honestly. I liked his "Reckless" album.
I enjoyed that as well. Was the cover a black and white portrait?
Yes, I believe it was.
I think "Summer of '69" was on that album.
I do believe it was. What a great song that is, don't you agree?
I agree one-hundred percent.
What else even was there on that album? No great great hits.
Well it's hard to match "Summer of '69" with anything.
I guess. I mean "Ain't Gonna Cry" was great too.
You can't seriously be comparing "Summer of '69" to "Ain't Gonna Cry," are you?
I most certainly am.
That's insane.
No, "Ain't Gonna Cry" is just a great song from a great album.
That's one thing we can agree on, that "Reckless" was a great album.
Agreed.
