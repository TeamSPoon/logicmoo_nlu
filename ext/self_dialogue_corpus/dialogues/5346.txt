I can't wait to see the new Beauty and the Beast live action movie on blue ray.
You didn't see it at the movie theater?
No, the timing just wasn't right. Did you see it?
Yes, and it was amazing. Seeing it on the big screen really brought it to life.
Was it as good as the original?
It was even better. Emma Watson was amazing!
How did the musical score compare to the animated version?
It was every bit as good, if not better. The  title song by Ariana Grande and John Legend was amazing.
I'm so excited to watch it tonight. I can't wait to see Emma Thompson as Mrs. Potts, she's one of my favorites!
You won't be disappointed! Don't forget the tissues!
