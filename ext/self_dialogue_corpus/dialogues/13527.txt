Do you like the Star Wars Movies?
Yeah‚ I enjoy them but I'm not a superfan or anything
Yeah‚ I know what you mean
Some people are just fanatical about them
Do you prefer the original ones‚ the last lot or the current ones.
I enjoy them all really‚ no real preference for either series.
Do you prefer one side over the other‚ are you a fan of the Empire or the Rebels?
I'm pro-rebel all the way‚ the Empire is evil!
Would you ever dress up as a character from one of the movies?
Oh hell no‚ that is not my thing at all
