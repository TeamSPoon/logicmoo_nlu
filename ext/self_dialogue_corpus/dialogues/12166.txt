So which one do you think is the worst?
It's gotta be Phantom Menace.  Everyone agrees on that!
I don't know - isn't Attack of the Clones worse?
But The Phantom Menace has Anakin as a kid.
I know, he wasn't very good...
Remember all the times he said "Yippee!"?
I paid more attention to that annoying Jar Jar.
I don't think the kid could act at all.  And Jar Jar?  The worst.
Well, yeah, and he was in all three of the prequels, so they all kind of stink.
The Phantom Menace has the most Jar Jar.
