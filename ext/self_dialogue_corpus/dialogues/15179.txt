Hey, I heard you're a King Crimson fan!
Oh, yeah, totally. Early period, of course.
What's your favorite album?
Larks tongues. I'm a total fan of Jamie Muir!
Oh yeah, same here. He was amazing! I always figured Fripp got rid of him because he took the Limelight.
Well, how couldn't he? He played like a madman! And he was so incredibly
My favorite is lizard. I just love the horns!
Same here! I never really liked horns that much until I heard the album. Now I'm crazy about them!
I think Fripp is crazy to take down his albums when people post them to YouTube. I totally think people are more likely to buy them if they get to hear them. It's not like you get introduced to King Crimson randomly.
I agree! I have sent links to their albums to people, and they have told me that they actually went ahead and bought them.
Whose lyrics do you like best? Sinfield or Palmer James?
I love them both! I think sinfield was a great producer, and they should have had him produce all their albums.
I totally agree.
Do you totally love Fripp's guitar playing on Eno's albums?
Oh, man, I do! His solo and Baby's on Fire is just beyond words!
I completely agree! I really regret getting rid of all my albums. Those King Crimson albums were so well made period the covers were so beautiful, and they simply don't look as good in CD format. They sound better, but they don't look as good!
You got rid of your albums? I was going to, but luckily, my husband wouldn't let me. If it weren't for him, I wouldn't have mine anymore.
Lucky you! My wife and I were reading a lot about Japanese tea houses, and we were seriously going in for minimalism in 1992. Still are, but I regret getting rid of some of my albums.
I can dig that. They do take up a lot of space. I should probably get rid of at least some of mine.
I if you get rid of it you wish you still had it. If you don't get rid of it, you will never need it or want it again! Anyway, Crimson is awesome! So cool to meet another fan!
