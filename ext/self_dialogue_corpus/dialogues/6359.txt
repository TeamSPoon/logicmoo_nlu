What is your favorite kind of Disney movies?
I enjoy movies that teach a lesson.  What about you?
I like those kind too, but I really like the ones that are funny.
Me too!  I like those better than my own kids.
Really though, it seems like the jokes are for more of a mature mind.
I agree, it goes right over my kids heads.
Why do you think they make the jokes so hard for kids to understand?
They probably do it for us parents.
Yes, you're probably right.
They probably do it because they know that we will have to watch it a million times.
