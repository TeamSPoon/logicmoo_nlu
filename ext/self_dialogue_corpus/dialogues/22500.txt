What is the best action movie of all time? It has to have everything.
Well that's simple its True Lies. Arnold brought it.
I don't usually tear up but One Day with Anne Hathaway got to me.
Yeah, that final scene with that music piece was emotional.
That It trailer mest me up. I couldn't sleep last night.
Don't remind me! You know how much i hate clowns.
So what are we seeing this weekend?
I'm thinking sci-fi. Maybe Alien: Covenant?
Is Goodfellas like the best gangster movie ever? Seriously, Joe Pesci was incredible.
Almost. You forgot about The Godfather.
Just saw Black Hawk Down. Sad now.
I know. It's one of those movies you only want to see once and forget.
Happy to see Emma Stone win Best Actress.
Yeah, she was great in La La Land.
Who wins? Maximus (Gladiator) or Achilles (Troy)?
No brainer, Achilles. He's in his prime.
Dude, have you seen the Raid? I just saw the best fight choreography ever.
Whoa, really? I have to check it out now.
Don't watch the Conjuring!
Why? Is it that scary?
