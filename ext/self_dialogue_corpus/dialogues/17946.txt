Do you like Sonic Youth?
Who are they?
They're an indie noise-rock band from New York. Started in the 80s, still going strong.
Sounds interesting. What's their sound like?
Noisy but beautiful. Sometimes a little strange, especially with the guitar tunings.
Cool! What's your favorite album?
I really like Daydream Nation. That's an early classic.
Any well known songs from that one?
Teenage Riot is good.
Alright. What about their more recent stuff?
Some of it is more mellow, but still edgy.
What recent albums are good?
The latest album I've heard is The Eternal. That's good.
Nice. Have you seen them play live?
Oh yes. They're really good live. Some improvisation.
Oh that sounds up my alley. Are they grungey?
They influenced Nirvana and other grunge acts, I think. But their music is beyond that.
Pretentious, arty stuff?
Haha, yeah sometimes. But they still have an ear for a catchy tune.
Good good!
