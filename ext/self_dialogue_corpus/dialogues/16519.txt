Did you hear about Meatloaf's new album?
He has a new one? What's it called?
Braver than We.
Have you heard any of the music?
Yeah, there were some clips on Amazon.  He still has the golden voice.
Sounds great! Did he work with Steinman again?
Yep! And you can hear the signature style in some of the songs.
That's great.  I was a little disappointed with Welcome to the Neighborhood.
I know. I mean, it had some great tracks, but it just wasn't the Steinman sound, was it.
Exactly.  Speaking of Steinman, did you know that he did a womens group project?
No, I didn't.  What was it.
Pandora's Box.
So, he wrote a bunch of songs for some women?
Yeah, and for the singers, he picked women that had operatic training so that they could hit the notes.
That sounds amazing.
It is.  There's one song, "The Future Just Ain't What it Used to Be" that is so sad and yet hopeful, you know?
You mean kind of like that old song, "Hello Marsha"?
Yeah, a little, but in Future, it has this super powerful vocal, and it's almost like the sound you would expect in a southern church.  The vocalist really belts it out.
Like Halestorm?
Kinda, yeah.  Strong vocal and completely unapologetic.
