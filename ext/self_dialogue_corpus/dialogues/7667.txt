I just saw Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire.
Oh, yeah. How did you like it?
I thought it was great. Especially when Twilight died.
Ha. That was pretty good. However, there was so much missing from the movie that was in the book.
I know. It was the first movie that really broke away from the book.
Of all of the movies, I think that Goblet of Fire was the one that should have been split in two.
Really? I think Order of the Phoenix  is the one that should have been split up into two movies.
I disagree. What would they have done, had them at the house for most of the first movie.
That's true. I guess it would have been rather boring to watch since move of the movie was just "mundane" stuff happening.
Yes. Then again, it would have given Creature more film time.
