Hey mom did you by chance see my blue button up I always wear?
I haven't seen it recently no.
I really need it today, I am going to my high school reunion.
Oh than I will surely help you look, I want you to look nice.
Thank you mom, I am excited to see some old friends.
Are you gonna see any girls you missed your chance on?
I hope so, and I want to see my old football buddies.
You had so many friends that came over back then to watch the games.
There is a Seahawks game today, I may invite a few people over.
That is such a coincidence, I was reading today that former Seahawk went to your high school.
A player went to Hamilton, who was it?
I think his name was Warren something..
Warren Sapp?
No, it was Warren Moon!
Oh yeah, he was a great player.
It was just cool seeing that someone famous went to your school.
That is cool, Shia Labeouf went to my school too!
Impressive!
Anyways I am gonna get going.
See you later for the game son, I love you!
