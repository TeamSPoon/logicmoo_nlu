Do you know who won the most recent Super Bowl?
Are you kidding me?
No, do you?
Of course I do! It was the Patriots. They came back from 25 down over Atlanta.
Oh, that's right. It was all over the news at the time.
Exactly. How could you not remember?
Well, I don't follow the NFL that closely.
Oh, I do. I'm a huge fan.
Of any particular team or in general?
Well, I'm actually a fan of the Patriots, but I like the game in general.
No wonder you remember the Super Bowl!
Being a Patriots fan helps, sure, but it was also a historic game.
How so?
Because in the Super Bowl no other team had been down more than ten points and won.
Oh wow, and they were down 25?
Yes, and in the third quarter.
Ok, I guess that is impressive.
It was quite the game to watch.
I usually only watch for the half time show and commercials.
As a football fan, and a Patriots fan, that just hurts!
