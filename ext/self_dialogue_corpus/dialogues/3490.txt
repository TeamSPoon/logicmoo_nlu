A friend of mine wants me to find a really horror movie that's in black and white. Something from the old days.
Has she heard of Dead of Night?
I don't think so. What's that about?
Some guy meets a group of people in a spooky old house where they share nightmares and crazy stories.
Doesn't sound all that scary.
You have to see it for yourself. There's even a crazy ventriloquist and his even crazier dummy.
Okay, ventriloquists and those dummies are always scary to me. I'll look it up. What year was this movie made?
1945.
Any good actors in it?
Ralph Michael is in it and it was written by H. G. Wells.
