So I think they should have stopped making the movies when Paul Walker died.
I don't know man, I think that's unfair to fans who didn't have him front and center, other characters have strong followings too.
Well, I don't see how it's not going to be on everyone's mind when they watch any of them from now on.
I think the character Dom is strong enough, and the fan base big enough they will be fine.
I guess but I still feel it's a bit tacky.
It's business, and the movies are mostly about the cars and the mods and hey, in that lifestyle, people die.
We'll see, I guess ratings will drop if people agree with me more.
I'm still going to go see every one they make.
Are they making another one?
Talking about it or a spin off series.
