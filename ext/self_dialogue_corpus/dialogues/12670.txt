All right, name the most memorable droids in Star Wars. I'll start with R2D2
C3PO, of course.
Ah, I see you C3PO, and raise you BB-8.
Okay, how about the Imperial Probe Droid.
That's memorable alirght, but GONK is more memorable.
Who?
The square droid from the sandcrawler in a New Hope, say's Gonk followed by some more gibberish
Oh, now I remember, but what about EV-9D9?
You lost me there, which one is that?
The droid in charge of Jabba's droids, the one that is having all those other droids tortured?
