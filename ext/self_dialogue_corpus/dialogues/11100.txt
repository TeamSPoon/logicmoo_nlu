Did you see the pictures from the MET gala?
Yes I did. There were some great outfits this year?
Who do you think had the most creative dress?
Rihanna's dress was really artistic and captured the theme.
I think Traci Ellis Ross had a dress by the same designer.
Yeah I think her dress was great too.
Who do you think was the worst dressed?
Well Selena Gomez's dress was really simple and boring. It looked very off-the-rack.
I agree. I don't think any of the men's outfits were very interesting either.
Do you think high-water pants are appropriate for a tuxedo?
You're right. I saw a lot of ill-fitting pants. With men's pants, tailoring is really important.
I know. Did you see Joe Jonas' outfit?
Was he wearing corduroy?
I think it was corduroy or velvet.
Well either way, it looked really silly.
He looked like a red carpet.
Ha ha ha. You're too funny. His brother's tuxedo was nice though.
I agree. Some of the designers dressed multiple people, but some celebrities looked better than others.
Like Zac Posen?
Yes! I can't believe the dress he made for Amy Schumer. She looked like a trash bag. Meanwhile Katie Holmes looked stunning.
