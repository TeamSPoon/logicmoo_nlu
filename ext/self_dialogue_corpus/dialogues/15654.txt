What is your favorite type of music? Mine is classic rock.
I like a lot of music but pop culture is my favorite.
Who is your favorite singer in pop culture?
I really like Katie Perry but I also like Taylor Swift.
They don't like each other much do they?
It is actually really crazy at how much Taylor Swift doesn't like Katie Perry.
My all time favorite pop singer is Byonce and I loved her half time performance.
I wonder if we will get to see Byonce's twins any time soon.
I like Lady Gaga too because I love her "Born This Way" song.
Yes she is really powerful when it comes to music and feeling the music.
Yeah and not to mention she is way supportive of equal rights for everyone.
Who is your favorite Classic Rock Group?
I would have to say Journey is my ultimate favorite but I also like Chicago.
What do you think of the young asian kid that is now the lead singer of Journey.
He is actually really good. I saw them in concert a couple of years ago and he sounded really good.
I saw them recently and the hardest part was seeing him on the stage instead of Perry.
Yes, I just laid back on the lawn and listened with my eyes closed.
Do you like any type of country music?  I love Carrie Underwood.
She is great and to come from the reality tv show is awesome.
It really is and shows that those shows can find real talent that can make it.
