What do you think about the STORM TROOPERS.
I think they are in all the STAR WARS movies.
I think they get upgrades.
They look more modern in the newer movies.
But they still look mean.
They would get into all those blaster fights.
They were kind of like soldiers.
They would just going in and blast away.
But they had their Tie Fighters also.
And blast in space!
