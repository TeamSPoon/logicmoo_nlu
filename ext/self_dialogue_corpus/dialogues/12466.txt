Do they ever show Darth Vader's face?
Yes
When?
At the end of Return of the Jedi
Cool. What does he look like?
He is old and bald
Interesting. Is it true that they replaced him?
Yes. The ghost scene in one of the new versions took him out and replaced him with another actor.
That is kind of mean.
I agree
