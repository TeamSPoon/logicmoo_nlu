Okay, who did Uptown Funk better, Bruno Mars or Rick Astley?
Wait, Rick Astley did Uptown Funk?! I must find that on YouTube. Now wait.
Okay, did you find it?
Wow, Okay, I have to go with Rick Astely.
No way! Nothing is better than Bruno Mars.
Oh no, everything Rick Astley does is awesome.
Really? Okay, well I'll stay in this century with Bruno Mars.
Oh, Bruno Mars is great. But come on, it's Rick Rollin' Astley.
Agree to disagree.
Okay.
