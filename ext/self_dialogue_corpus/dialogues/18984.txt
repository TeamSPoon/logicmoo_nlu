Have you been listening to Country music lately?
Sometimes, why do you ask?
It just seems to me that Country music today doesn't seem like the Country music of old.
What do you mean?
Well, many of the songs you hear on the radio today almost seem like rock or even rap hybrids.
Do you mean like Brantley Gilbert or Sam Hunt?
They are two examples.  I like their music, but it does not represent what Country music really is.
You mean like Randy Travis, Alan Jackson, Garth Brooks and Alabama?
Yes, some of the good old country music artists.
You're right.  The music definitely is not the same as it used to be.
That really disappoints me, since I really liked Country music how it used to be.
Well why don't you just turn off the radio, and listen to what you want to listen to, from YouTube.
I should really do that.  It's just sad the radio stations buy into the latest fads.
I know, it would be really nice if their were some Classic Country radio stations out there.
We had one in our area, and they took it off the air, replacing it with an Oldies Station.
I wonder what they were thinking.
I have no idea, but it was really a bad choice on their part.
You know who I think is one of the greatest Country artists of all time?
I can't wait to hear what you will say.
Brad Paisely.  He has to be the best guitarist ever!
