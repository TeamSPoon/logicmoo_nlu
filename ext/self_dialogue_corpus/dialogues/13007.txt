How great of a character was Yoda
He was inspirational for many people.
I think that he should not have died.
Well some of the story would not make sense then.
He was wise but I think that it would keep going.
Do you think a Yoda reprise is in the works?
I think they will come out with a similar character but not actually name it Yoda.
You would think it could exist in some manner.
I think eventually you will see flashbacks.
With today's technology it should not be a problem.
