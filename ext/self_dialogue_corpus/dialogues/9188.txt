I saw a cute story online about Dave Grohl from Foo Fighters.
I love Foo Fighters. What happened?
Apparently he has an 8 year old daughter who takes after him and wanted to learn to play the drums.
Not surprising. I think kids inherit things like musical ability.
He was playing a gig in Iceland and called her onstage to play the drums for a song.
That is funny! What did she play?
She played drums for the song "We Will Rock You" while the rest of the band played along.
Oh how cute. Was she any good?
Apparently so. The crowd supposedly loved her.
Maybe she'll join the band when she gets bigger like Eddie Van Halen's son joined Van Halen.
