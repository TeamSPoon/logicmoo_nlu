carly rae is so good
she really is so underrated
she should have had the best pop album
yeah, instead of taylor swift
it was full of those 80 vibes
80s is coming back now
i think 90s is too
both of them, i suppose
carly has such nice infectious pop music
its hard not to like them
cut to the feeling is the new single
it is so good.
emotion was such a great album too.
i hope she comes out with a new album soon
i think she is
thats probably why she released cut to the feeling
yeah, just a little teaser
she is fast with making albums
she had that bonus thing of emotion last year
yeah, every year new material
