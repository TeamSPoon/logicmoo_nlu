I just saw that new Disney movie, Moana.
Is that the one with Dwayne Johnson?
Yea. He's a really good voice actor.
Nice. So how was the movie?
Really good! It's about a chieftainâ€™s daughter who wants to venture out into the sea which is against their customs.
Who does The Rock play.
A demigod named Maui. His song is actually my favorite.
I'll have to check it out. Is it anything like the little mermaid?
No, but the Directors are Ron Clements and John Musker. The same ones who directed The Little Mermaid.
Wow, I'll definitely have to watch it now.
