I told you earlier about one possible Return of the Jedi ending, want to hear another?
Sure, why not?
George Lucas toyed with the idea of killing Han Solo at the end and leaving the rebels broken?
That would have been a downer of an ending.
He apparently nixed the idea as he worried about toy sales.
Probably a smart move on his behalf.
So he decided it would be better to just have a big old Ewok party.
And party they did!
Toy sales really drive so much added volume that you have to account for that factor.
Merchandising, merchandising, merchandising!
