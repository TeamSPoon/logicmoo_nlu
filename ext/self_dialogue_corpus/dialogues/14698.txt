Did you watch the Lakers and Celtics game last night?
Yeah! The Celts really stuck it to them!
I wonder what Kobe was thinking at the end of the game?
Probably something like "get me outta here, this is awful!"
Probably so! What do you think the chance is for the Celtics to go all the way this year?
I think if Pierce and Rondo stay healthy, there's a good chance.
I'll be keeping my fingers crossed. I'd love to see it.
Me too! We should totally have a watch party when the playoffs start.
Absolutely! We would have fun doing our own game analysis.
Definitely! I love looking at how teams call plays.
Who do you think is the best rebounder the Celtics have?
Probably Pierce, even though he's not a big guy.
What's the big goofy guy's name, who's always awkward handling the ball?
You know, I can't remember.
Hmm. Okay. What do you think about Lebron this year?
I think he's doing well, but he's a little overrated this time around.
Why do you say Lebron is overrated this year?
He just hasn't put up the scoring numbers.
Fair enough. Do you think he'll ever be considered as good as Michael Jordan?
No way! Michael Jordan will always be the greatest!
