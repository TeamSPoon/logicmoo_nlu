What happent to the Bothan spies in Rogue One?
What do you mean.
"Many Bothan spies died, to bring us these plans."
That was Return of the Jedi.
Huh?
Roge One was a prequel to A New Hope.
Oh. That's right.
Yeah. The Bothan spies brought the plans for the second Death Star.
How did I get that mixed up.
I did the same thing, at first.
