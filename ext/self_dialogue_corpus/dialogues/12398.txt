Why did Finn turn on the stormtroopers in The Force Awakens?
Because of the atrocities he'd witnessed. He wanted to escape it.
But didn't he grow up with them? Why was he the only one who objected?
As a fluke, his training and conditioning didn't take.
I would've liked to see Finn express more remorse about it, though.
Why? Finn isn't an evil person.
But he turned on everyone he knew. He killed people he used to serve with.
He did it for the greater good, though.
That doesn't make it emotionally easy.
Perhaps he's just stoic. He's burying how he feels because there's work to do.
