I hate most things to do with racing
Why it is so boring to me to be honest
Then why do you seem to be into the fast and the furious so much
Because Vin is awesome
Well i guess i cannot disagree with that
He is one of the more real actors out their
What do you mean real
Like he is relatable and understandable
Well yeah he is down to earth guy in interviews too
He is really calm and hilarious
