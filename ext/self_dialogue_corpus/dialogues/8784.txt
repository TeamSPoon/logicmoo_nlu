Hi.
Hey.
Do you like live rock shows?
Yeah sure.
When was the last time you saw a live band play?
I saw a local rock band a few nights ago.
How was it?
It was pretty great actually.  I wasn't expecting much but they were really good.
What kind of music was it.
They were a blues band that was really together.
