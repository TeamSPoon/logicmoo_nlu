Have you seen any great movie classics lately?
Not really. How about you?
I just saw the Sound of Music for the first time today!
You have never seen it before? Isn't it great?
It really is. Julie Andrews is amazing.
What other movies is she in?
I know she is in the Princess Diaries movies.
Oh, right! She plays Mia's grandmother!
Yep. Those are great movies.
Isn't she in an animated movie as well?
Yeah! She plays the voice of Fiona's mother on Shrek.
Oh I didn't realize that was her. Do you like the Shrek movies?
I really do! I love the soundtrack to the original Shrek.
Is that the one with Accidentally In Love?
Yeah! Such great music.
I'm a Believer is also in the movie.
What has Eddie Murphy done since he was the donkey in Shrek?
I really don't know actually. I can't think of anything
Cameron Diaz was also in Shrek, I think.
Yeah, she played the voice of Fiona.
