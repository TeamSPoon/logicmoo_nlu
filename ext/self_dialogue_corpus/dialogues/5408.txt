Have you watched Moana?
Yeah! It was cute, but I thought it was a little inapproapriate.
Oh, really? Why is that?
I think it glamorizes tattoos and exposes children to them at such an early age.
Yeah, I saw most of the male characters had tattoos, but they were tribal and part of their culture.
That's true. It still isn't something I want my kid looking at and wanting to get.
I understand. You can probably just tell your kid that some culture norms are different and even though they have tattoos in theirs, doesn't mean it's acceptable in yours.
Well, I'll just tell my kids to not get any funny ideas and stick to the movie plot. Which was excellent, by the way.
I know, I love how wacky the demigod Maui was!
Oh, I particularly loved that he resembled Dwayne Johnson so much, my favorite actor!
