So be honest, before you knew they were brother and sister, did you think Luke and Leia would get together?
No, I really didn't. They always had that good friend chemistry, plus I kind of suspected something was up.
I agree. I think they seemed as though they could be close friends.
I think she ended up with the right guy in the end.
Yep. I guess she was drawn to Han's bad boy appeal.
I guess he had that, though he did plenty of good too.
I just mean that his whole attitude was kind of like that, even while doing the right thing.
I think he was a great person at heart, just a little rough around the edge.
I agree, but I can see where a couple of things go differently and he has a completely different story.
I could see him working for the Empire if a few things went differently I suppose.
