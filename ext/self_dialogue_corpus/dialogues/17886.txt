Do you like 80s music?
Some of it.  Do you?
Yeah, it's by far my favorite genre. Have you heard of the Psychedelic Furs?
I don't think so, but what do they sing? Maybe I'd recognize a song.
One of their most widely known hits is "Love My Way."
Oh, I love that song! Didn't know it was by them.
My personal favorite song by them is "Heartbreak Beat." You should check it out.
I'll do that. Meanwhile, you like country music?
Not really. Why?
I'm a big fan of it, that's all. Check out Brantley Gilbert if you get a chance.
I'll do that right now.
Heartbreak Beat's a great song, by the way.
Glad you liked it! What's a good song by Brantley Gilbert for me to start off with?
I like Bottoms Up. It's a great song.
Not bad, but not really my cup of tea. Sorry...
No worries. But please tell me you like the Red Hot Chili Peppers.
Of course! Who wouldn't?
I know, right? Love their new album, The Getaway.
That's a great one. Dark Necessities was the only song I listened to for days once I heard it.
Oh yeah. One of my favorites from them in a while.
