What do you think is the greatest movie of all time?
Well, the experts say Citizen Kane.
You know what, I've never seen it. It sounds boring.
You have to see it in most film classes.
I sat through the Seventh Seal once.
Ingmar Bergman, right.
Yes, I still have no idea what it was about.
Lol, sounds like most great movies....
I walked out of a movie called The Tempest back in the 80s.  It was based on Shakespeare.
I'll remember never to see it.
Seriously, of movies I've seen and like I think The 10 Commandments has to rate up there.
That movie had a huge production budget.
People like Hitchcock's Vertigo.
It was good, but I like North by Northwest even better.
How about Kubricks 2001 A Space Odyssey.
Interesting, but I was young when I saw it and got bored.
Hey, let's not forget the Godfather.
That spawned a lot of pop culture.  And Brando proved his greatness.
I don't usually like thrillers but Psycho is a classic.
Isn't Bates Motel loosely based on that?
