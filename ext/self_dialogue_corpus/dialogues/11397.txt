Their debut album please please me was released by Parlophone which was founded in Germany, actually
Yep, it started in the great britain as a jazz label in 1920s
Kinda funny how that's now EMI
Well, companies merge all the time. But EMI's label manager George MArtin is the one who signed the Beatles.
You know what they shold've done?
What theyshould've done... about... what?
They shold've released "I saw her standing there" as the single.
I was gonna say "Love me do," but ok.
That's good too, but "Please please me" is ranked lower than "I saw her standing there"
Rolling stones rankings meaningless. It's a popularity contest. That's all.
