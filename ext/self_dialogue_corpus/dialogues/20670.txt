What's your favorite Studio Ghibli movie?
Definitely Castle In the Sky. How about you?
I've never seen that. I'd have to say either Spirited Away or My Neighbor Totoro.
Spirited Away was amazing, but I think I might have been too young when I first saw it. Yubaba wa terrifying.
Nah, probably not. Yubaba still terrifies me.
Hahaha. I love the animation, though.
Me too, all of it, the people, the food, the spirits, even the water in the bathhouse.
Oh my God, that food made me want to eat it. I didn't even know what half of it was, but it made me hungry.
I think that was the point. It was supposed to look really tasty.
It did.
It was the pigs that scared me. That part freaked me out.
Yeah, me too. It was really well done.
I loved the soot sprites.
Me too, they were so cute. Did you like No Face?
At first he scared me, but I did later.
Same. I felt the same way about Haku.
Yeah, me too. It was hard to tell at first who was an enemy and who wasn't.
I think it was supposed to be like that.
Now I want to watch it again.
We should have a Studio Ghibli marathon day. My sister has Spirited Away, Totoro, Castle in The Sky, Princess Mononoke, and Kiki's Delivery Service on blue ray.
