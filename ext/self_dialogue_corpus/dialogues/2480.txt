Hey are you going to watch the Chiefs and the Patriots game?
Probably so, when is it?
September 7th
Oh..where are they playing?
Gillette Stadium!  I wanted to get tickets.
I don't know, I'm not a huge fan of the Chiefs.
Me neither, but the Patriots are awesome.
Well they're both good teams, I just don't like watching the Chiefs.
Why not?
I'm not a fan of Alex Smith.
Oh, I don't even know who he is.
He's their passing yard.
Oh.  That's Tom Brady for the Patriots.
Yeah, I like him a lot better.
He is a great player!  I think he does better than that Smith guy.
Well his stats are definitely much better.  He had almost twice as many touchdowns last season.
Wow, that's impressive.
I wonder what new players they will have this year.
I don't know.  I'm hoping to find out at the game.
Well maybe I will watch it after all.  I don't know.
