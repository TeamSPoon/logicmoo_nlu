Have you heard of Beck?
Beck the beer?
No, Beck the musician
Oh yeah, I like his work
Great mix of folk and rock
Yes, but definitely classifies as alternative rock
Yes, I agree
What's your favorite Beck song?
Well I'm always a fan of his early work like Where's It At and Devil's Haircut
Yeah, those are classics. Also I'm A Loser Baby
And his new work holds up. I liked Morning Phase.
Yeah, I really didn't like that one.
It won a lot of awards
Yeah, but I still wasn't really a fan.
I think he has another album coming up
Well did you hear his release WOW?
Yes, that was awesome.
Yes, it's a single from his upcoming album.
Oh man, that implies some good things to come.
Yes, for sure.
