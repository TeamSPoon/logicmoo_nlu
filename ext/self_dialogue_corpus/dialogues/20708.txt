What is your favorite Batman movie?
I love the Dark Knight.
Is that the one with Joker?
Yeah, Heath Ledger killed it.
He was a really good joker.
Do you think Jack Nicholas was a good Joker?
He was for the role he played.
What do you mean?
His Joker was more like the comic book.
Wasn't Heath Ledgers Joker like the comic book?
That's the thing with Batman there are so many different versions of the comic book.
Wasn't the Dark Knight movies based off the comic books?
Yeah it's an actual series called The Dark Knight.
Did you like the 3rd movie?
It was okay.
It was too long to me.
Yeah, 3 hours is a long time for a movie.
Batman isn't even in the first hour.
I did like Bane.
Bane was good but he was hard to understand when he talked.
