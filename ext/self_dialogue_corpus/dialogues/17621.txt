What do you think about solo instrument music?
Like solo piano, guitar or violin. I enjoy it because it can be really relaxing, especially solo piano.
Who's your favorite solo pianist?
Yiruma. His music is so captivating and beautiful.
What's your favorite Yiruma song?
River Flows in You. It's a very peaceful song that you can just sink into.
Do you think solo instrument acts should get more attention in the mainstream?
On one hand, yes, because there are many great solo artists who deserve the attention, but on the other hand that type of attention tends to ruin specific areas of music.
Just because a song or artist becomes popular or mainstream doesn't necessarily mean they'll eventually become bad.
True, but it's a longstanding pattern that has happened with many genres and artists.
Do you believe solo drums or percussion artists are just as good as any other solo instrument?
There are many amazing drummers and percussionists out there that can do great work without other instruments on the track.
Many people find that the sounds of drumming or percussion alone sounds incomplete or even annoying as a song.
I can see how they'd think that way, but you can make some great music with drums and other percussion instruments alone. You just have to find the right artist.
Who is your favorite drummer from a band?
Keith Moon. Some of the work he did with The Who was fantastic.
Who is your favorite solo drum or percussion act?
Phil Collins. It's simply incredible what he can do on his own with such a wide variety of percussion instruments.
Outside of drums, what is your favorite percussion instrument?
It may sound silly, but the xylophone. Many people think it's a goofy or childish instrument, but, like any instrument, you can make great music with it.
