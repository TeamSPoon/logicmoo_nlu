Do you want to see a rematch in the Finals?
Not really. I would rather it be Spurs and Wizards.
Hate LeBron that much?
I just am bored with Warriors and Cavaliers
The NBA needs a rivalry like this.
They do but I hate these superstar teams that has become the NBA.
I think that if you go passed that, its good for the NBA
Not really because if youre a team that is middling, you can never be great.
Sure you can, go through Free Agency.
Well if you have an owner that does not like to spend.
Well then he or she shouldnt be owning a team.
The goal is to win championships.
Yeah and that cost money at times.
I agree with most of what you are saying.
So say its Wizards and Spurs. Who do you want?
Spurs just to have Pop show he can win with anyone.
He might be the best coach of all time.
I dont know hes definitely up there though.
I would like to see him coach the 76ers.
Even he couldnt do that, he is not Jesus.
