What do you think about Eric Clapton?
He's one of the best guitarists alive right?
Yeah, what are some songs you like of his?
I like "Cocaine" and "Wonderful Tonight."
Personally, I like some of his work with Derek and the Dominos: "Thorn Tree in the Garden" and "Layla."
The guy's had a rough life, hasn't he.
Yep. He's in concert later this year in Los Angeles and New York.
Wow! We should go see him. How much are tickets?
Tickets start at $100 each and go all the way to $3000 a seat.
It might be worth it if we're in the area!
Yeah, I think so. These might be some of his last live performances.
How old is the guy?
He must be about seventy or so by now.
When was he at his peak popularity?
It must've been in the 1970's or 1980's, if i remember correctly.
There were so many amazing guitarists in rock at that time. Ever heard of Jimi Hendrix?
I definitely have. Such a shame what happened to him.
Yeah, I agree.
I must have over a couple hundred songs from the rock era.
Me too!
