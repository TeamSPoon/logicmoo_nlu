Did you ever watch the two Conjuring movies?
I didn't know there were two.
Yes, the same people were the paranormal investigators.
I think Vera Farmiga is a great actress.
She is, she really takes on the roles.
I wonder if the actors get scared doing those parts.
Like when she has to face the demons in the people?
Yes. It must seem sort of real.
I'm sure a lot are special effects.
Yes, but, the scene itself is creepy.
I know, like when they were in the basement with the mother in the first movie.
Yeah. With the sheet over her head.
The actresses voice had to be creepy.
I like Patrick Wilson too.
I love that actor.
He played his part good too.
The Warrens were actual people.
I know, they actually did those things.
I wish I had the gift to see dead people.
Me too in a way.
