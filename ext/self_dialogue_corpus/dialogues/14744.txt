Have you seen Why Him?
No I haven't? Whats it about?
It is about a family visiting their daughter and her eclectic boyfriend for the holidays.
That sounds interesting. So I'm assuming there is some crazy stuff that happens.
Oh ya. When I say eclectic I mean it.
Who plays in it?
It stars James Frano and Bryan Cranston.
Oh that has to be good then. They are both hilarious.
Ya it is. It is definitely not to be watched with children though.
Oh ok. Thanks for the heads up.
