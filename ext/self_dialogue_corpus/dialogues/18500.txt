Have you heard that song by George Micheal called"Amazing".
No, is it good ?
The song is Okay, I like someof his older hits.
I think he did his best work in the 80's
Yeah!, I agree, I have not listen to his music lately.
I wonder what happen to the group  Wham?
I think George Micheal went on to become a single act.
Wham, was such a cool group, and they made some great music.
His first solo album had the single called"I want Your Sex" on it.
Yeah, I know that song and I like it.
He is a great pop and R&B singer.
The song called "Everything She Wants" came out in 1984.
Yeah!, I like the video he made to that song.
I also like the song the called"Father Figure" a huge hit.
Do you remember that song called"Careless Whisper"?
Yeah, That is a huge hit too and a very romantic song.
The song "Everything She Wants" is one of my favorite songs.
His song called" Last Christmas" is pretty good .
Wham was a popular music in the 80s'
George Micheal is a talented singer and an 80's icon in my opinion.
