Did you see the latest Star Wars movie?
Oh, Rogue One, you mean?
That one, yes. The one with no stars or recognizable characters in the plot.
Well, I'm guessing by your tone that you didn't care for it much.
No, I can't say I cared for it much at all. I think it may have been the worst Star Wars movie yet.
I can't agree with you there, bro. If you watch it without caring about the rest of the Star Wars movies, it's really a great flick.
So what you're saying is it's a great movie that has nothing to do with Star Wars?
No, I just mean it's not directly connected to the main story you are used to by any major characters.
Okay fine. But I still wasn't drawn into the movie in any case. I mean that movie before it, the one with the droid shaped like a ball, was pretty good, and it wasn't filled with familiarities.
It was the Force Awakens, mister non-fan.
I don't have to be a fan to appreciate a good movie. Maybe you being a fan clouds your judgement, though.
No, I'm pretty sure you are just a Star Wars hater. Do you hate Star Trek, too?
I love Star Trek. Especially the Next Generation.
Wait, you like TNG more than the original series?
Yes, it was so much better. I assume you prefer the early crap?
Crap? Whoah, dude. You have just sinned and you must leave my house immediately.
HAH! Yeah yeah, I get it, you love the original Star Trek.
Dammit, Jim, I'm going to kill you.
What about Deep Space Nine, though?
Scotty, beam him out of my face.
