Hey, I just got offered box seats for next seasons 49ers games
Wow that's awesome! How much are they?
The guy said he's not going to be using them and he won't charge us.
Well are you going to take them?
I don't know. We don't really know too much about football.
You're right. I don't even know the name of any players on the 49ers.
Me neither. But if we had box seats for all season we would learn.
That's true. And it's nice to go to the park.
Yes, I do enjoy the excitement of the competition and the crowds
Ok. Let's do it. Maybe we'll become huge 49ers fans
I suppose we could do some research before we go. Maybe read up on the team
True. We could check their website and learn the players and coaches names so that we would look like we know a little.
Right. And maybe we could get some jerseys so we fit in.
You know I like clothes shopping. Yeah, let's get into the SF 49ers fashion
Ok. But I don't want one of those jerseys with the players name on the back. Someone will inevitably ask me something about them.
And you won't know who that is! How hilarious
Well I'm going to tell my friend that we'll take the tickets
Ok, I'm on the 49ers website right now. Let's see, who is the quarterback?
At least you know the names of the positions!
That's true. So, what's your favorite postion?
