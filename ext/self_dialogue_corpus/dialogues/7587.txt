Who do you think the most over rated wizard in the Harry Potter movies is?
That's easy, all the Malfoys.
Yeah, especially Luscious.  I mean everyone was terrified of this guy and he hardly did anything except spew threats.
I like the Mr. Weasly stood up to him and he seemed to back down.  Gives me the impression that maybe Malfoy was all talk.
Voldy seemed to have esteem for him at one point.  But he turned out to be a punk.
Yeah, you can see at the end he looks like hell.
Might have been interesting to see him fight.  Although it seems his wife might be stronger than him, at least mentally.
Any Draco, although he was like his dad.  All talk and no fight.
Always claiming how tough he was and never really fought anyone.
I wish Harmine would have turned him into a toad.
