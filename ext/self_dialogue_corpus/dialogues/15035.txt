Have you seen 'The Hangover' movies?
Only the first one, which I thought was pretty good. Not the others, though.
I've seen all 3 and I agree, I think the first one is my favorite.
So you wouldn't recommend the other two?
Not really - if you've seen the first one that's kind of all you need. Zach Galifanakis is just so funny.
He was the main reason I watched the first one, actually.
I'm glad he's getting a lot more movie roles. I always loved his stand up comedy.
Me too, and he somehow brings that weird sense of humor to mainstream movies.
He's one of the few actors where I know I'll laugh, so I'll see a movie just because he's in it.
Same here - him and Will Ferrell are guaranteed to make a movie funny.
