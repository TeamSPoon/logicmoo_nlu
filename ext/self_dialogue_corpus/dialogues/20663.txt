You know the movie I'm looking forward to?
No, what movie?
I can't wait to see National Treasure 3.
You must be kidding, right?
No, I really liked the first two.
I felt like the first one was good in a cheesy kind of way, but the second one was just awful.
I think they're just fun movies. Nicolas Cage was made to play characters like that.
Characters like what? Ones who have crazy conspiracy theories?
He just is good in action movies I think.
You consider National Treasure an action movie?
To some extent, I suppose it is.
I consider National Treasure a kid's movie. It's rated PG.
That makes it fun for the whole family though! And you kind of learn history while watching.
I wouldn't call what's in those movies history exactly.
You know what I mean though. They go all over Washington DC and Philadelphia searching for cool history clues in the movie.
I'm not sure how accurate the clues are though.
Maybe they're not accurate, but the movie sure is entertaining.
Maybe to some people, but not to me.
I guess I won't invite you when I see National Treasure 3 at midnight.
Yeah, it probably wouldn't be a good idea.
