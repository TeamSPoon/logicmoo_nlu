I know it's not technically a 'princess' but my favorite Disney (non) princess is Pocohontas.
I saw that when I lived In Zurich, Switzerland.
Disney is beloved everywhere.
This was a really cool showing. It was in a park in downtown Switzerland and hey showed it outside like a drive in movie.
That must have been fun.
Oh, it was. For a mere 10 Swiss Francs we got to see the movie, were issued a heavy cardboard 'stool' that we all put together ourselves, and a box of popcorn.
That's a lot for 10 francs.
You bet is was. And the funniest thing happened 1/2 way through the movie.
What was that?
The ground was soft from an earlier rain so half way through the movie, one by one people's cardboard stools collapsed and you'd just see heads disappear. It was funny. I fell, too.
