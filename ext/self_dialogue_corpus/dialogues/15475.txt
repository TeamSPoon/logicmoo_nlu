Have you discovered any new bands lately?
Yeah there are a few I have gotten into.  Mainly discovered them on Pandora
Like what?
Horsefeathers and the 1975 are two I've been into lately.
I've heard of the 1975.
Yeah apparently a song of theirs is popular on the radio now.  I didn't know that.
FUnny how that works.  You just hear it on the radio one day.
Yeah I almost get mad like, I thought they were a secret.
Haha...yeah I've had that happen before.  What is Horsefeathers like?
They are kind of folk sounding.  Kind of mellow but really really good
That's cool, would you compare them to someone?
Hmm maybe Nicklecreek in a way?
That sounds like something I may like.
YEah you should check them out.  THeir station on pandora is really good.  I've also gotten into some older stuff.
What do you mean older?
LIke, classics... Jim Croce is one.
Oh that would be really good!  I bet his station pulls a good variety.
For sure.  The older I get the more I like some of the older sounds. Neil Young, James Taylor.
Aw man that sounds cool, I'm going to add some of those to my mix.
Yeah it's fun to switch it up for sure.
