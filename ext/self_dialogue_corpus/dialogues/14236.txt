What do you think of Lady Gaga's music?
I think it is wonderful.
I wish she came out with more albums.
She just came out with one though recently.
Yeah but that is not yearly though.
What is your opinion of the new music?
It is good but not as good as the old.
I agree on that.
She should go back to her old sound.
She needs to be more club music.
