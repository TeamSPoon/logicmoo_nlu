What do you think about the Steelers chances this year?
I think they have a good shot at winning 10 or more games and making the playoffs.
Why is that?
Well one thing is that Martavis Bryant will be back.
Yes and also placing the franchise tag on Le'Veon Bell helps.
Correct, if he had gone to another team that would be bad!
Do you think Ben Roethlisberger can stay healthy?
Well at his age that is hard to say, but when he gets hurt he is often able to come back quickly, even playing injured.
And signing Antonio Brown to an extension is good since he's probably the best wide receiver in the league.
Right he's the highest paid receiver for a reason.
What do you know about TJ Watt?
It's tough to predict which college players will do well in the NFL especially towards the bottom of the 1st round but he has a pedigree through his brother.
Do you plan on watching the Steelers game again this year at the local Steelers bar?
Of course!
It looks like the first game won't be on TV here in Philadelphia since the Eagles play at the same time on the same network.
Ok we will go to the bar then.
What do you think the score will be?
Well even with Myles Garrett the Browns are still pretty bad so even on the road I think the Steelers win by something like 28-17.
Yeah that is what I thought too, a relatively easy Steelers win.  Talk to you later!
Good talking to you.
