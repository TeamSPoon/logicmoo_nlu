How do you feel about symphonic metal?
I've only heard a bit. It's rather like gothic metal, isn't it?
Sometimes. I'd say it depends on the artist.
Could you recommend a symphonic metal band, in that case?
Nightwish is one of the more well-known bands. Leaves' Eyes is good too.
I think I've heard of Leaves' Eyes. I thought they were more of a viking metal band.
They are also called that sometimes. They are also a bit operatic sometimes.
So which of their songs would you recommend, then?
Symphony of the Night is a good one. It's from an album of the same name.
Sounds interesting. Any other songs?
I believe Elegy and My Destiny are also some of their most popular songs.
Thanks. I usually listen to pop and a little rock, so its interesting to find other music to look into.
What kind of pop?
Rihanna and Britney Spears for the most part, then individual songs from other artists.
So you mostly listen to those two and bits of other things then? Like some rock and such?
Yes. I actually listen to a bit of most music genres. I like most music.
So you aren't picky about music then?
I guess not. I mostly like songs though, not so much bands.
I usually listen to all of a particularly band or artists work, so I'm very different then.
Well you probably hear more obscure or less popular songs from a band that way.
