Did you see last night's basektball game?
I did. I thought the Spurs were going to win.
I thought they were going to win also until that guy got hurt.
Who was it that got hurt? I didn't see the play.
It was the big guy that plays center, David Lee.
Oh! What happened to him?
He was going up for a shot and he landed on some guys foot, hurting his ankle. Do you know how many points he had?
I heard he had ten points. What about Durant? DId you see him?
Yeah, he was amazing with all of those rebounds.
And he had 30 points and 10  assists in the second half.
No one on the Spurs could guard him.
What do you think are the Spurs chances of winning the series?
I don't think they will win the series, I don't know if they will win one game.
So it will be another Warriors/Cavs finals?
Yes! for sure. I think the outcome will be different from last year.
So you think the Warriors will win it all?
Definitely! They have much better players now
I think you are right.
Warriors in 6 games.
I think the Cavs will win in 7.
