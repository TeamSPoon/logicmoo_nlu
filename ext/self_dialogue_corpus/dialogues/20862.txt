Did you ever see Prom Night?
I'm not sure. Is it old or new?
It's from the 80s.
Ho, I don't think I saw it. Who was in it?
Jamie Lee Curtis and Leslie Nielsen.
Was it a comedy?
No, a horror thriller about a murdered schoolgirl.
I thought Leslie Nielsen was only in comedies like those old Naked Gun movies.
I used to think that too, but apparently he did some dramas too.
Was it good?
Yes, very good. These grade school kids killed their friend and someone is getting revenge 6 years later on prom night.
Sounds like my kind of movie. Jamie is a cutie too.
Yes, I ike her a lot.
She was great in Halloween.
Did you see She's in the Army Now?
Yes I did. It was another one of her great roles..
She was really funny. I've seen it a few times over the years.
She's very easy on the eyes!
Absolutely! Did you see her in Forever Young?
Yes. I'm not really a big Mel Gibson fan, but that was a good movie.
