Heard any good rock music lately?
Not really any new stuff. I mainly listen to my old Metallica tapes.
I love Metallica. The Black album was my favorite.
I can listen to that for days. It takes me back to a better time in my life.
Rock music can do that. It can bring up so many memories.
I've actually seen them in concert a few times and they were fantastic.
I've always wanted to see them live but never had the opportunity.
They're actually still touring. They did a bunch of shows last year.
I had the opportunity to see them and Guns N' Roses together about twenty years ago but couldn't make it.
That would have been incredible. Those are my two favorite rock bands.
