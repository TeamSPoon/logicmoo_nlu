Did you know Lady Gaga is touring again?
Yes! I am so excited. I've always wanted to see her.
You got tickets for her show?
Yes, I was able to get tickets for the Philadelphia show.
That's awesome. I love her dance music.
I like that, but I actually really like her new stuff even better.
I guess I haven't heard much of it. Is it a lot different?
Well, it is still pop music, but it is much less electronic.
That's probably a nice change.
It is because you can really hear her talent because her voice doesn't sound like it is as manipulated.
