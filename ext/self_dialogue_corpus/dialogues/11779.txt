I wanna hear that song "I Wanna Hold Your Hand".
Cool
Who did that song?
I'll give you a hint. They are from Liverpool.
The Beatles?
Yes.
Wow, that is a great song. I never knew who did it.
The Beatles are one of the best bands ever. They have tons of good songs.
Can you recommend another for me?
Girl. John Lennon sings that one. It is great.
