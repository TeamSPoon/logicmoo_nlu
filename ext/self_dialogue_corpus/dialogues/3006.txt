Who do you think the top five NFL teams will be this year?
That is a hard question.
It is.  I would start with the returning Superbowl champs.
The Patriots?
Yup.
Then I would include the Falcons.
I would agree with that.
Then who do you think number three would be?
I think the Raiders.
I would agree with that.  Seems odd.
Why do you think it is odd.
Because they had not been good for many years.
Yes, they had a rough stretch.
Then what about the number four team.
I think I would go with the Steelers.
That is probably a good choice.
And at five?
I would say Packers.
Yup, Green Bay has been good for a long time.
Rogers helps them with that.
