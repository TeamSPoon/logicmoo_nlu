Hey, so do you listen to the Rolling Stones?
A little bit, but I don't know too much about them.
You should really explore their music!  I think they're one of the best bands ever.
What's so great about them?
Mick Jagger, the lead singer, is an amazing artist.  They were formed in London in 1962.
Wow, I didn't realize they were so old.
Yeah, almost sixty years ago.  Their music is still popular.
I guess that timelessness is a sign of greatness.
Well if you listened to them, you'd see.  They weren't in the Rock Hall of Fame for nothing!
So what are some of their best songs?
Well, Brown Sugar is pretty awesome.  You Can't Always Get What You Want is great, too.
They were from the same era as the Beatles, are they similar?
No way.  I would say they have a completely different sound.
That's good to hear.  I hate the Beatles.
Yeah, I'm not a fan either.  The Rolling Stones are more rock with a little blues influence.
Oh okay.  I didn't think they were similar but I had to ask.
You should check out I Can't Get No Satisfaction too if you're going to listen to their music.
Maybe I'll just check out their greatest hits.  I'm sure I can find it somewhere.
Yeah, there should be a greatest hits album.
Thanks for the recommendation, I will check them out for sure!
