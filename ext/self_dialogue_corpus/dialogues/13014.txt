Have you seen any star wars movies lately?
Yeah I saw the Empire Strikes Back.
I really liked Marc Hamil's perfomance in that movie.
Me too. He really stood out especially against vader.
What did you think of Carrie Fisher's character?
Well she also does an amazing job.
I agree.
What was your favorite part?
When Vader tells luke he is his father.
That was classic.
