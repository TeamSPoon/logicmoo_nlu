Have you seen that movie, Planes, Trains, and Automobiles?
No, I have not, never heard of it.
It's an old movie with Steve Martin in it.
Is it good?
It is laugh out loud funny!
Is it on Netflix?
I think it is.
Sounds like a good movie.
It is, I saw it at the movies theatres and was embarrased how loud I laughed.
Who else is in it?
John Candy, he and Steve Martin are really the only two in it, besides extras.
John Candy was a great actor. I love his movies.
Maybe we can watch it together.
That sounds great!
Want to do it tomorrow night?
Yeas, I'm free tomorrow.
I'll bring the popcorn
I will get some soda, and candy!
It will be like going to the movies, only more comfortable.
Okay see you tomorrow at 7:00!
