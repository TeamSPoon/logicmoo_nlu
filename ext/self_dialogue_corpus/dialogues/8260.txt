If Aretha Franklin is the queen of soul, who is the queen of pop?
That is a no brainer, it has to be Madonna.
Oh, I never thought about her. She had a lot of songs in the 1980's.
Not only the 1980's but she ruled in the 1990's.
What is your favorite Madonna song?
I have a lot of favorites. I love Express Yourself, Vogue, and Like a Virgin.
Sounds like you are a huge fan. Does she still make new songs?
She came out with some new ones in 2014 like Devil Pray and Living for Love.
I love it when a musician really devotes their life to their music.
I don't think that girl will ever retire.
