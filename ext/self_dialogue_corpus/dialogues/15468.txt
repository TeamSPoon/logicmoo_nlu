Do you ever think about how music can affect your mood?
Yes, I've thought of that before.
I feel like listening to something like Enya could be good for stress.
Anytime I'm stressed out I listen to Slow Magic, or Flume.
I love Flume so much.
I do too. His newest album "Skin" is absolutely fantastic.
I've had it on repeat since it came out.
I've played that song he did with Tove Lo so many times.
Have you heard Illenium's remix of that song? It's great.
No, I'm not sure I know who that is.
His music is similar to Flume's in a lot of ways.
I would probably love it then.
That type of EDM is getting really popular right now.
Yeah, I know. They call it "Future bass".
I always wondered if there was a term for it.
I'm okay with it getting more popular. It's so calming.
It is, but you can also nod your head to it.
I agree, it's a really good mix of styles.
All of the sounds they use to create it are truly mesmerizing.
Definitely. I feel like it really is the future of music.
