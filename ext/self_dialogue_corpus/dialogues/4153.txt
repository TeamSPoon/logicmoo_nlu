In your opinion, what the best thriller movie of all time?
I'd have to put Psycho at the top of the list.
Good choice! Alfred Hitchcock is the master of making thriller movies.
He really is. Another of my favorite Hitchcock films is Rear Window.
I don't think I've seen that one. Who's in it?
James Stewart and Grace Kelly.
Yes, I haven't seen Rear Window. What's it about?
James Stewart spies on his neighbors through his window and believes that one of them has committed murder.
Sounds like it's a suspenseful movie.
Another Alfred Hitchcock classic.
