What is your opinion on metal?
It can be good. I think that it can sometimes become mostly screaming.
I agree. There seems to be a difference between screaming and some bands that actually produce music that could be classified as metal.
I prefer the musical metal.
What's a band that you consider musical metal?
I would consider slipknot one of those bands.
Slipknot? They are pretty hardcore.
Yes, but they are also melodic.
I could see that. They have some catchy tunes even with all of the screaming.
Wait and Bleed is definitely a catchy tune.
Duality and Psychosocial are also catchy tunes.
Duality, definitely.
Would you ever consider seeing slipknot in person.
Probably not. I value my ear drums. I can imagine it would be an intense concert.
Not to mention, a very interesting one as well.
The people there are interesting, I bet.
Definitely. It's a different breed of people at metal concerts.
It would be good to go for the experience, I guess, but my poor ear drums.
I agree. Maybe in my younger days I would have gone.
If that's the case, would you still be here to live to tell about it?
