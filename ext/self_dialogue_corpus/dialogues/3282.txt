So, what are some of the more recent good horror films?
Jeez. I can't get on board with most of them. So many weak franchises
I'm with you there. Annabelle, Conjuring, Insidious. It's just all the same
Isn't it funny how horror works? So many trends and ripoffs.
The last good ones were The Babadook and The Witch
I really loved The Babadook. And The Witch was quite interesting
Not as scary as hyped, mistake in marketing there.
I can't even think of any horror titles coming out this year actually.
I know. It's really depressing
Think I'll just go back to the old classics, like Halloween
