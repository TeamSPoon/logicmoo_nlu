What's your favorite radio station?
I have a few, though my area doesn't have as much choice as I'd like. WCLZ, WBLM, WBACH
Wow, that's a variety - new/world/indy, classic rock and classical.
I'd add jazz if there was a jazz station. I also listen to top 40 stuff too.
Not a country fan?
No, not really, that is to say  I love bluegrass and oldy timey Opry stuff like Hank Williams and Patsy Cline, but new not so much.
You have a lot of country stations near you.
Ugh yes, they come in the clearest and step all over the other stations.
Lots of NASCAR fans in your area.
Yeah, if we are going to stereotype.
How's BLM in comparison to the HCN and CCC of your youth?
BLM is awesome and same as it ever was. Just a great mix of true classic rock. Few hair bands and one hit wonders, no Creed or Nickelback.
Don't they do that thing every year, the A to Z?
Yes! In fact I think it starts this weekend for the 4th. It takes about two weeks I think.
Every song in their catalogue, one letter at a time?
No, they have more than that in the catalogue but they switch it up. They play a lot of cuts that were never radio hits.
So cool! So you will hear a song from an album you once owned but had forgotten.
Exactly! And because I spent so much time here as a kid before I lived here, it's like jumping back to 70s me!
Fleetwood Mac Rumors, Boston. Doobies, Jackson Browne, James Taylor JT, Steve Miller... ahhhh.
Those were the days, my friend. :)
