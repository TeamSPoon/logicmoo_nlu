Which 90s rapper is your favorite?
That's a tough one. Probably Eazy E.
What do you think about Ice Cube?
He has a good legacy, but seems more commercial nowadays.
Yeah, he has toned down quite a bit since his early days.
I think that Snoop Dogg has stayed relevant.
Yeah, his music videos are still interesting.
I think Jay Z has endured.
Well, he's certainly wealthy!
No argument there!
