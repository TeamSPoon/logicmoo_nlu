Hey, have you seen that recent movie with Matt Damon and Willem Dafoe?
You mean the one about China or something? No, I haven't.
Yeah, it's called the "The Great Wall". It was released in 2016.
Oh, okay. I haven't really heard or seen much about it on social media or TV.
I guess that true. I just saw it on the list of recent releases and it was one of the movies I haven't seen yet.
Did you watch the trailer?
I've seen the trailer once or twice somewhere and it looked interesting.
So, should I watch it?
To be honest, I had low expectations for the film because I thought it would be those cheesy, historical-like films. But, it was very surprising the got me on the edge of my seat many times.
Really? What is it really about?
It's about one of the legends of how the Great Wall of China was built. But, it includes a horde of reptile-like beasts that come over and attack after a certain period of time.
Well, I mean that's cool but was it too predictable and was the CGI at least okay?
The CGI was seamless and really set the whole background, creatures, battles, and Great Wall up really well. It wasn't predictable at all because it focused on the purpose of the story while having certain instances of betrayal, loyalty, comedy, action, and romance.
Oh, please don't tell me that they drag out the romantic scenes in this one. It's seems imbalanced when there's too much in an action film.
Actually, I was really surprised and glad that they focused on the action and adventure and not so much on romance. It just showed them having an interest and respect for each other which was a great balance for this movie.
Really? I guess I should take a look at this film.
You know what? It's so good that it makes me want to watch it twice.
It's that good, huh? Okay, I'll watch it if you join me.
Yeah, sure. You won't regret watching it.
Great. I hope you're right.
