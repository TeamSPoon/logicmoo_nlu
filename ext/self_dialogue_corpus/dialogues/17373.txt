You should. They're a great band.

Ireland.
Really? I like an Irish band or two.
They're not a new band by any stretch.

nearly 40 years.

Rock.
Nice. I like rock.
Good good. Give them a shot. They're on tour right now.
Really? Have you seen them?
Yes indeed. Just a few weeks ago and 4 times before that over the years.
Nice. What did you think?
Amazing show to be sure. 30th anniversary of the Joshua Tree album.

I saw them 2x in Boston a couple years ago.
Very very cool.
