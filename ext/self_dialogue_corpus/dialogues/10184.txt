Have you seen the new Mummy movies?
Is is action of horror?
It is an action one, a bit of horror, but mostly action.
No, I have not have you?
Yes.
What did you think of it.
It had a lot of action, obviously, but the story line fell.
I like the action, but those type of movies need some kind of story.
This one had none, not really. Just running around and killing mummies.
I do not think I will see it then.
