Hey man, nice shirt. Opeth is a great band!  What's your favorite album?
Thanks! That's a tough question.  Right now, I will say my favorite album is Blackwater Park.
Yeah, that's a good one.  What do you think of their newer stuff?
I hate their new stuff.  They try too hard to be progressive rock, but it just sucks.
Really? Well, for the most part I think you're right.  The last two albums have been pretty weak.
Yeah, I hate when bands change.  It's a complete disregard for their fans that got them to where they are today.
I disagree with that.  Bands have no reason to cater to their fans. Their music should be coming out of their souls, not to please a market.
Yeah, you're right.  Their new stuff still sucks though.  I just wish they bring back more of their older metal elements in the future.
I loved Heritage.  That's one of their best albums in my opinion, minus the first and last tracks.
Really? I hated that one.  It's way too pretentious. Well, I gotta go. Nice talk.
