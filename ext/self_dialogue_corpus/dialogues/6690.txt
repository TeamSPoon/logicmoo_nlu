I cant wait to see Mary Poppins returns next year!
Yeah I heard that was going to be a fantastic movie
Did you see the first Mary poppins?
A long time ago when I was a boy back in 1969
That was a long time ago, did you enjoy it back then?
yeah, it was a moment to remember thats for sure.. just like that one disney film Mulan!
Yeah I heard about that, there making a Live action version of that.. I cant wait!
thats pretty cool! Mulan was a Disney classic to be sure
yeah nothing beats Disney films there timeless
I agree, these films really bring people together!
