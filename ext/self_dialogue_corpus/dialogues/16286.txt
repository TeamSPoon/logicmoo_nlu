Who is your least-favorite classical composer.
I get A LOT of crap for this, but Wolfie.
Wolfie?
Oh, that's my nickname for Mozart.
Ha, nice one.
Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, and he has like six other middle names.
Why don't you like him?
His music is almost a parody of classical music: incredibly predictable, boring, in-a-box.
Does he have anything you like?
His late music can be tolerable, like his Requiem or his "Dissonance" quartet.
"Dissonance quartet?"
Yeah, he wrote a quartet that was super dissonant, at least for its time. At one point, there's a few measures with almost no consonances.
Nice! Does it work?
Yeah it sounds alright. But most of his music just bores me to death.
It's probably because you've only heard a small output of his oeuvre and had to re-teach it hundreds of times.
Yeah, his sonata k. 331 in A major drives me crazy. I hate it.
I like his variances on sonata form.
Know what I love most about music?
What?
People NOT saying oeuvre. I hate that word. It's so snobby.
