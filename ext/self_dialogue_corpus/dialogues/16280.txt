Are you going to any concerts this summer?
I was going to see The Nitty Gritty Dirt Band, but they canceled coming to the fair.
Nickelback is coming, we are thinking about going.
I like them, but not sure it's worth the money
Yeah, I don't know why people criticize them so much, they are a good solid rock band
I've heard they put on a good show
We shall see!  We also saw Donovan earlier in the spring
How was that
Not bad, not as good as I had hoped, but he is getting older
I enjoy going to see local bands
I do too, but it doesn't seem like there are as many options for that anymore
I know what you mean, our cafe used to have a group every weekend but they don't anymore
Yeah, I think that costs are just too much
I haven't bought a cd in ages
Me either, I think that new music is just so bland anymore
I agree, nothing really worth buying
Grunge and rap were the last time we had really good new music
Now it's all coporate
Yep, it is just boring
Yeah, everyone goes to see the old bands
