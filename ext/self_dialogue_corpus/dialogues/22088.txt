My wife bought home "Clown" on DVD yesterday.
Not to sound stupid or anything, but what is clown?
CLOWN is a story of a loving father who dons a clown outfit and makeup to perform at his son's sixth birthday, only to later discover that the costume--red nose and wig included--will not come off and his own personality changes in a horrific fashion.
So the clown outfit is cursed?
Yep and to break the curse of the evil outfit, the father must make grim choices with his own family facing danger.
So, did you like it?
I had a blast watching it. It was creepy, and gory.
I guess it is a good thing you don't have a fear of clowns.
Man if I did, I would be messed up right about now.
It sounds like an original premise for a movie.
I actually really enjoyed this one but you already know  I'm also a sucker for monster movies.
Who isn't?
This is a  creative new monster. Sure, we have plenty of scary clown movies, but this one was unique in that the man literally turns into the clown, against his own will, as the suit and decorative attire just absorb into him.
I love the sound of this concept. Plus is sounds as if it was very creepy.
It was! Making the dad become the monster was an unique and a creative new spin on the scary clown idea.
You are making me want to go out and find this DVD.
You won't be disappointed. I can guarantee you that.
Did it remind you of Penny wise?
In a way but not really. This is a whole different type of beast.
Where did you find that movie?
