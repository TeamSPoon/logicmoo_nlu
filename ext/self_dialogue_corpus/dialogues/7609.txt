Okay, I just reread the entire series, let's talk about our least favorite characters!
I absolutely hate Bellatrix.
Well, she's a horrible woman, but not a bad character. I mean characters that don't have much of a purpose.
Well, then it would definitely be Lupin.
Shut your mouth, wow. Lupin is a saint.
Well, I hate the force Tonks and Lupin storyline, and I think Lupin is just kind of weak.
He taught Harry how to do a patronus. And was a good teacher and friend.
No, he literally just did nothing and stayed in the background most of the time. Who's your least favorite?
Wow, you're delusional! My least favorite character would have to be Molly Weasley.
Okay, we can't be friends.
