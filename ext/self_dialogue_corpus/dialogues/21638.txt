Do you watch many movies?
No, not really. I'd like to watch more but I end up watching TV instead.
What was the last one you saw in theatres?
I think it was La La Land.
Did you like it?
Yes, I liked it, but I wasn't head over heels like most people. What about you, did you see it?
No, I didn't see it yet. I think my last one was Hidden Figures.
I wanted to see that so bad! I just never got to the theatre.
It was an amazing movie. The actors were excellent and the story was really powerful.
I'm going to have to try to find it on demand or in the redbox.
You definitely should. Do you have an all time favorite movie?
Well, I love Wizard of Oz. It is such a classic, but actually I am partial to the movie Big Fish.
Ok, I've definitely never heard of that.
It has Albert Finney and Billy Cudrup in it. It's an excellent movie.
What type of movie is it?
More drama, but definitely some fantasy elements. About an older man basically reliving his life through "tall tales."
It sounds really boing.
I'm not doing a great job of explaining it.
Well, I'm not really into fantasy anyway.
What about Harry Potter?
