Do you remember Case?
The ones that sing Touch Me Tease Me?
Yeah, that's them.
I remember them. What made you bring them up?
Because that song is on the radio right now.
That's my jam. What station are you listening to?
105.3...WDAS FM.
That's my station. They be playing all the jams.
They played some Guy right before Case.
Goodbye Love?
How'd you know?
Just a guess. That's my favorite Guy song.
I like Let's Chill.
Was it still the three of them when they made that song?
Yeah.
I wanna hear Spend The Night.
You can pull it up on youtube.
You got me just about to do that. I hope my neighbors don't complain.
Why yo say that?
Because I'm going to turn it up loud. I love loud music.
