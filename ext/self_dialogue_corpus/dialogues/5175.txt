Have you seen that one movie Disney made called BFG?
It's about that Giant that is actually smaller than the other giants and a good one right?
Yup that's the one. I liked it a lot but what did you think?
I thought it was pretty good. It had some funny moments.
The way the giant spoke was funny and the little girl was adorable with her personality.
I was a little surprised about the green drink though.
True, the having them fart in the Queen of England's presence was a bit much.
It was pretty funny though but I feel like slightly tacky.
The best part was the ending though.
I loved how they forced the evil giants to be on a rock island with nothing but the horrible vegetable to eat.
