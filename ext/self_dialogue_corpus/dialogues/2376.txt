Who do you think has the best receiving corps in the NFL?
That is a tough one.  I think the New York Giants receivers are all really, really good.
Do you think they are better than the Patriots receivers?
I think the Patriots have a more balanced team with the running game and the looks they can give defenses, but I think based off talent alone, the Giants receivers are better.
Patriots did add Brandin Crooks to Julian Edelman and Rob Gronkowski.
Yes, but the Giants have Odell Beckham Jr., Sterling Shephard, and they added Brandon Marshall.
Marshall is an injury risk though, and sometimes does not do well with his teammates.
Team chemistry is a concern, but the talent is there.
How do you think the Giants stack up against the receivers of some of the other NFL teams.
I like the Giants as the best in the NFL.  Other good teams with good receiving corps, to me, are the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Dallas Cowboys, and the Atlanta Falcons.
Now I really like the Falcons receivers, I think they can get back to the Super Bowl with those guys.
They certainly have a great chance to do that.  Julio Jones, Mohamed Sanu, and Tyler Gabriel are great receivers.  Plus, they have Devonta Freeman and Tevin Coleman.
It will be interesting to see the divisional games between the Falcons and the Bucs though.
For sure.  The Buccaneers added DeSean Jackson to Mike Evans.  That move alone puts two big time play makers on the field on the outsides.
That combination resembles what the Steelers have in Antonio Brown and Martavis Bryant.
That is a good comparison actually.
Yea, I feel like Jameis Winston compares nicely to Big Ben when Ben was younger.
Interesting comparison.  Winston has a cannon for an arm, and his ability to be just mobile enough is where they are similar.  Winston's accuracy is a big question mark in my opinion.
Well, Winston was just a rookie last year.
True, but accuracy is a must have trait in an NFL Quarterback.
