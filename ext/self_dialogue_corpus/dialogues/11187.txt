What kind of shoes would you wear with this dress?
Probably silver or white flats or a low heel.
Maybe my silver ones with the straps?
That would be fine, or you could borrow my white ones.
I don't know which I like more.
I'd say the siler ones but it's up to you.
OK. I'll wear those then.
Also wear that pretty watermelon tourmaline necklace with it.
That's a great idea.
It looks good on you too and will match perfectly.
You always know so much about fashion. You have a great style.
Thanks. I just wear what I like.
How about these earrings?
They look nice with it.
I love these. I got them at Walmart believe it or not.
Walmart has great jewelry and it's pretty cheap.
I don't shop there often but I have noticed that too.
I have a few pieces from there. That blue necklace you like came from there.
Maybe I'll see if they have more of those so I can get one.
They had it in pink too. I'll help you find them.
