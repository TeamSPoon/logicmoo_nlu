What is your favorite Tool album?
I think I like Lateralus the best. What about you?
I really like Undertow and Lateralus. How long has Tool been around anyway?
I believe that Maynard founded in back in 1990.
Wow, I didn't realize that it had been that long.
I know. Did you know technically, their first album wasn't Undertow?
No, I didn't. What else could it be?
It was a demo they made called 72826.
Aren't demos usually just for the record company?
Usually, but the band was so pleased with it that they decided to sell it to fans.
