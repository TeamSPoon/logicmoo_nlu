Did you see that Derek Jeter had his number retired the other day?
Yeah! Wasn't it Saturday night at Yankee stadium?
Yup, I was there with my family, the Yankees dedicated a plaque for him too.
I'm so jealous! I used to love watching Derek play.
Same here, but I don't think he's the greatest Yankee player to play the game.
C'mon are you serious?!
Yeah dude lol Derek Jeter only had 260 home runs his entire career...
Ok so what's your point?
Babe Ruth had 714 home runs, you just can't compare the two.
You certainly can. Derek Jeter was a 14x Allstar player, Babe Ruth was only a 2x Allstar player.
Hmm but Babe Ruth was a 7x World Series Champion.
Derek Jeter was a 5x World Series Champion and won the Golden Glove 5x.
Look man I'm not disagreeing with you but Derek Jeter will never be on the same level of Babe Ruth.
I guess only history will tell.
History has already spoken, I've never seen Derek Jeter hit 4 home runs in a single game.
Your telling me you saw Babe Ruth hit 4 home runs in a single game?
No I wasn't alive back then but it's documented that he did.
I still think Babe Ruth is over rated, baseball has changed so much since he played.
Whatever dude. Derek Jeter isn't even in the Hall of Fame.
Not yet, he's certainly going to be inducted though.
