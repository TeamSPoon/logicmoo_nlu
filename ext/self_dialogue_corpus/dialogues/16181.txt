Do you like Electronic music?
Sometimes I do.
Have you heard of Aphex Twin?
No I have not.
They are one of the original electro music groups.
Oh okay today I learned something.
Yes they are famous because they are really good too.
Ok I want to hear them.
Yes they have a solid drum and beat in each of their songs.
Ok I like that.
They are also smooth sounding as well.
What do you mean by that?
They can use high pitch electronic sounds to really set the mood.
Do they use vocals?
Almost never actually.
When did they first come out.
Nearly 20 years ago they began making music.
Wow they have been making electronic music for a long time.
Yes they are really good at it too.
Ok thank you for the recommendation.
