I just watched the remake of dirty dancing
Was it good?
It's okay. The main thing I don't like about it is that it doesn't really portray the love story of baby and johnny
Really?
Yea, it's not just about dancing, it's about their love growing and everything
Exactly I totally agree
And this girl doesn't have the confidence, the original baby does.
I dont know if I want to watch it.
I watched it out of curiousity
I dont love it.
I dont think I would either.
What else do you like. I love all the elvis movies.
Me too, they are so good.
I like rostabout
Me too, that's a good one
I like animated movies, home was pretty good
I like that movie
My kids love it
My kids have watched it alot
I dont know if I can watch it that much
