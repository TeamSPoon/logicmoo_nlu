Do you listen to music digitally or buy discs?
I do both because sometimes I just want 1 song.
Usually if it's just an unknown or less popular person I will buy digital.
Yes thats what I mean.
I will buy a disc if it os of a big name singer because I want the whole album.
I agree like Justin Timberlake.
Yes or Beyonce.
I think that the last album I bought was actually Adele.
That was a great disc.
Yes I still listen to it often.
I always transfer my music to my iphone so I can listen to it everywhere.
I do too because I like to listen on my runs.
That's great because you can make playlists.
That's what I usually do.
Do you like more upbeat music?
I do because it helps me with pace.
I think cool down music is beneficial too.
Oh yes I have that too.
I love that music can be used so versatility.
Yes it brings out certain moods.
