I just can't seem to get into football anymore.
Why? What happened?
I just miss watching Peyton Manning.
You could watch highlights on youtube.
Yeah I know, but it's not the same.
There are 32 other starting quarterbacks, and you're sad over one being retired?
None of those other guys are Peyton.
Yeah I guess, but there are some really good ones.
Yeah? Like who? And don't even say Tom Brady.
Well, how about Joe Flacco?
The only thing I know about him is that he likes to eat McDonald's.
How about Jameis Winston?
I don't think he's very good yet.
What about Andrew Luck?
He's good,He just can't stay healthy.
Is that really his fault though?
No, but I would be sad that he was hurt all the time.
What about Big Ben?
Maybe, he's really tough.
Yeah he is, he's awesome.
