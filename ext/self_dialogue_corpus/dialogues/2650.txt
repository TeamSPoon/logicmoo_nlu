Where was the Superbowl held this year?
It was in Houston Texas
I love Houston so I wish I went! Where was it last year?
It was in California in 2016.
Very nice! It always is in such great locations.
Well it varies and would depend on what you consider a great location...
Where is it going to be next year? Let me guess - New York, Las Vegas or Miami???
Actually it's going to be in Minnesota.
I've never been interested in going to Minnesota, so I don't think I should go.
Were you planning on actually going to the game, or you're going to sightsee.
I wouldn't have minded a bit of both.
How would you get tickets?
I guess if I decided to go, I'd just get tickets when I get there.
I wouldn't suggest that. Getting a ticket is very hard.
It probably was hard this year in Houston or last year in California, but how many people actually want to go Minnesota?
Thousands! Thousands of people will be interested in going to Superbowl no matter what city it is in.
I guess maybe die-hard fans would be interested even if it's not an exotic city.
Exactly.
Who will be playing next year?
No way of telling yet. We will only have a better idea once the season is well underway.
