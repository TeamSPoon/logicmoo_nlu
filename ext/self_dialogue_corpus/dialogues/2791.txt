What do you think is the greatest game in NFL history.
That is a hard one.
I know!  There are so many great games.
Recently, there were a lot of Brady and Manning games that were good.
I would say the 1993 Monday Night Football Game at Mile High Stadium was the greatest?
Why would you say that?
It was Kansas City versus Denver.
Joe Montana versus John Elway.
Yeah.  The game was close the whole way through.
I remember that game.
Kansas City was down and then Montana led them back.
Then John Elway led the Broncos down the field to go ahead.
Then Montana with just over a minute led Kansas City the whole way down the field to win the game in the closing seconds.
Yeah.  I didn't think that there was enough time left to do that.
I didn't either.
That was back when they didn't throw the ball all up and down the field like they do now.
Yeah.  Do you remember what the announcer said when Montana won the game?
I do.  He said "Lord take me now.  I've seen it all."
That was classic.
Yeah.  It was a showdown between two legends.
