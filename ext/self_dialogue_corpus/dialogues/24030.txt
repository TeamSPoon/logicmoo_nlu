Who was the guy that did all of those 80's movies?
John Hughes
Did you see Weird Science?
Yes.
Is that one of your favorites?
No
What about Pretty in Pink?
I love that one
That is one of your favorites
Yes
It has a great love story
Yeah, but I heard the original ending was different
Yeah she was supposed to get with Ducky
I wonder why they changed it.
Test audiences did not like it
I don't like that directors change their movies to fit in
I agree, but it is about money as well as art to some people
That's a shame.
It's the sad truth about movies
I hope some directors did not give in
