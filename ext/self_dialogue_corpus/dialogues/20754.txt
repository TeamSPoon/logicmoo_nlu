I was chatting with my uncle about underrated movies the other day, and his answers really surprised me.
What kind of movies was he talking about?
Well, for a while he was talking about Alphaville.
Never heard of it.
It's a French sci-fi film directed by Jean-Luc Godard.
What's it about?
It's also kind of noirish. There's this city called Alphaville, and a secret agent is trying to destroy it.
Destroy the whole city?
Well, a computer that controls everyone in the city. It's a dystopian noir sort of thing.
Got it. That actually sounds pretty cool.
I think it would have more of a reputation over here if it wasn't a foreign language film.
That does happen sometimes. Did he mention any others?
He mentioned a more recent Japanese film called "Confessions".
What's that one about?
Two students at an elementary school murder their teacher's daughter, and she takes revenge on them.
That sounds dark.
It is. It's also shot in a really haunting series of blue tones. It's a strange movie.
But it's worth watching?
They both are!
I'll add them to the list!
