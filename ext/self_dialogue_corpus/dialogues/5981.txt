Frozen is one of the best Disney movies ever produced. The princesses actually solve the problem for themselves and it promotes sisterhood.
I like Frozen, but Tangled in still one of my favorites, Rapunzel's sassy attitude and independence makes the movie for me.
I like Tangled but I don't like how it doesn't really end, is that tear she cried her last bit of magic, or was it not all in her hair?
Oh I know what you mean. I like to think she doens't need the magic anymore and that was her last drop.
I never did really enjoy Princess and the Frog, I find it boring.
I can relate to that as well. Have you seen the new Beauty and the Beast live action movie?
I haven't! I can't wait to see it. I hope that it's as good as the reviews said.
I thought it was amazing, and even though I'm not a big fan of Emma Watson, she did a great job.
I still enjoy the classics though, I watched Sleeping Beauty the other day.
It will always be a favorite of mine. I did enjoy Maleficent too, I liked the spin they put on the story, making the prince the enemy.
