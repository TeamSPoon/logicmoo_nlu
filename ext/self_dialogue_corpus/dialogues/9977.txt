What's your favorite scene in an action movie?
The opening scene in "Saving Private Ryan" has to be my favorite.
I loved that scene. Tom Hanks and all the other actors did a great job at portraying what the Army really went through when they landed on Normandy that fateful day.
It was extremly realistic. I heard Steven Speilberg  hired something like 3000 real soliders to act as extras just in that one scene.
Oh wow, I've never heard that before, do you know where the scene was actually filmed?
They were fimed on Ballinesker Beach, which is in Ireland.
That's awesome. You can't get much better then the actors in that movie.
Vin Diseal, Matt Damon, Tom Hanks, etc. The list goes on and on.
How many Academy Awards did the film win?
It was nominated for 11 but won 5 in total!
