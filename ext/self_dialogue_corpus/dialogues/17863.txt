What about the genre of music called "Chicago house"?
What about it?
How does it relate to the history of electronic dance music -- EDM?
This style of music movement sprang up from Disco Demolition Night.
What was that?
It was a promotion staged by the Chicago White Sox.
What does a baseball team have to do with the history of music?
Their fans were mostly into rock music. So, they staged an anti-disco event.
It was a backlash against the popularity of disco?
That's correct. Then, people wanted -- perhaps even needed -- some new dance music.
And, Chicago house music arose to fill that need?
Yes, and it was pioneered by Frankie Knuckles.
I've heard of him. He was a club DJ?
Yes, but he was much more than that. He won a Grammy for his remixes.
I see. What kind of music did he remix?
He started remixing disco music. Then as techno became more popular, he remixed some of Derrick May's work.
Wow, that's amazing! It's interesting to see how disco and techno combined to make house.
Yes, that's exactly what happened. And, it's forever changed the course of music.
How so?
Music made with machines gets more popular each year. Soon, the machines will make music by themselves.
