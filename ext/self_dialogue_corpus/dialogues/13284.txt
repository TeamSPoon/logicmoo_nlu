Who do you think would win in a fight between Darth Maul and Darth Vader?
Oh Maul all the way.  He's a far better swordsman than Vader ever was.
No way, Vader would have destroyed Maul with his superior knowledge of the force.  Look at the closing scene of Rogue One.
Maul had plenty understanding of the force.  He was extremely skilled and more aggressive.
Vader destroyed half the Jedi on his own.  He was the strongest bad in the Star Wars saga.
No way, look at the way Darth Maul nearly defeated both Qui Gon and Obi Wan at the same time.
Yeah when Obi Wan was a beginner.  Old Obi Wan would have stomped him in seconds.
I don't know about that.  His double sides light saber was something else.
But I do agree, they were both absolutely awesome.
Yeah, I wish they would have kept Maul for at least one more movie.
