Ok Then who's the tallest player in the NBA currently?
That'd be Kristaps Porzingis at 7'3. Plays the Knicks
Who's the tallest ever?
That'd be two players. Manute Bol and Gheorghe Muresan. Both at 7'7
They probably have genetic diseases?
Not sure. Some of the really tall people generally have some kind of thyroid or growth hormone imbalances. Not sure if those two do also
Did you know that the tallest player in basketball doesn't play for the NBA?
Yes. Paul Stugess
How come he didn't get signed with the NBA?
He wasn't that good.
He's 7'8. He can reach the basket just standing.
Yep. Saw him dunk once. It was hilarious to watch
Doesn't even have to jump that high to dunk
Nor can he jump very high for that matter.
What do you mean?
Well, when human body reaches a certain height, things like jumping, running become difficult.
That's probably why they look so weird when they try.
Yep, awkward gait, and short vertical jump, because their bodies can't handle so much weight.
That's just like Football players. the linemen.
Yeah, really fat guys can't run even when they get the fumble and usually fall down because they can't coordinate their bodies well in running. Similar thing with the really tall basketball players.
