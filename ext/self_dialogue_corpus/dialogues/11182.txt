I need to dress business casual for work tomorrow. I'm not sure what that means.
Business casual definitely means different things in different places.
I don't want to wear jeans. Even if they're nice I don't think they're dressy enough.
I agree. What about slacks or some relaxed trousers?
I have a beautiful pair of navy blue trousers.
What about a top that is made out of a nice fabric?
I'm not sure. What fabrics are you thinking of?
Well, I think cashmere and jersey are inherently classier. Don't you think?
I agree. I have some solid short sleeve cashmere sweater tops.
What colors?
Well, I have a dark grey, a black and a brown.
I think that dark grey would be the best color to wear with navy blue pants.
I do too. I love that color combination.
What about a jacket?
I'm going to wear a blazer.
Ok, will you wear jewelry?
Yes, I'm going to wear something classic like pearls or diamond studs.
Classic is always a good choice!
True, but I may actually go with jewelry that makes a bit more of a statement since its casual Friday.
I would go with a statement necklace.
