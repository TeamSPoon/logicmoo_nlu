Have you seen Jennifers body?
A while ago
Same here i was thinking about rewatching it.
I dont remember too much of it
I think i liked it
Its hard with horror movies these days they are either scary or stupid
Like that mirrors movie it had good potential, but it was awful
Yea i wasnt a big fan of that myself
The ring was kind of stupid too
I agree
