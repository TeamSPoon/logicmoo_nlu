Whatever happened to DJs in hip-hop? The ones who scratched records and all that.
I'm not sure. I think people still scratch records.
I mean the ones who could rock the party, like Grandmaster Flash.
Oh man, he was really great. Even then, I think people mostly remember "The Message", which was more lyrics-oriented.
I loved "The Adventures on the Wheels of Steel".
I think it's hard to replicate what the DJ does in an airplay-friendly manner.
Except for mix shows. Man, I loved those growing up.
Me too. They always had crazy remixes and exclusives.
It used to be that every group had a DJ.
Now, rap doesn't even have groups. Long live the old school.
