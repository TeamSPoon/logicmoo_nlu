What do you think about Disney making all the classics with live people?
I am not sure. I mean I LOVE the orginals!
They did the Jungle Book and Beauty and the Beast so far and they have done well.
I agree but it feels like they are just trying to make some easy money.
I heard they are going to do Aladin.
I heard that too. I don't think they should because Robin Williams is the only person who can play Genie.
I agree that he made the entire movie.
It is hard to do that now with him being dead.
Well maybe they will find an acceptable replacement.
No one can fill his shoes.
