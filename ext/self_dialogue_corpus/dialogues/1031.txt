So it is almost football season.
I know cant wait til i have a game every Sunday to watch.
Still hoping the Steelers will go all the way to the Super Bowl.
Definatly theres no better team.
Really what about the New York Giants.
Nothing compared to the Steelers.
Seriously Eli Manning is their secret weapon
Eli Manning has nothing on the Steelers Ben Roethlisenberger
Eli is faster and has a better arm.
No way Ben might be a big guy but he has a cannon and he quick on his feet for such a big guy. Plus he can take a hit
Take a hit thats all he ever does since the Steelers offense is so sad.
New York is supposed to have a good offense They cant catch or protect their quarter back
You just wish the Steelers could be like they were in the 70s and 80s
Still my Steelers have won 6 super bowls compared to New Yorks 4 Super bowls Numbers speak for themselves
Sure 4 were won in the 70s and 80s when the good players and coach were in,  they arent any good now.
Almost all the NFL teams are better then New York maybe they can actually defeat Cleveland.
Oh Man that was mean the Steelers can even defeat the Cleveland Browns.
I think every team can defeat Cleveland.
We need to get together for a few of the games.
Sounds great we can argue the whole time.
