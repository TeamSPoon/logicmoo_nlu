Hey. How was your date last night?
It was horrible. My date seemed to forget that I exist.
What do you mean? Why do you say that?
Well, my date was obsessed with Selena Gomez. Apparently he is in love with her music.
Selena Gomez?! You're thirty-nine years old!
I know that! What is your point?
Well, Selena Gomez's music is followed by tween's. How old was your date? Twelve?
Oh stop it. He was thirty-six.
He was thirty-six and obsessed with Selena Gomez?
Yes! When he picked me up, he was wearing a Selena Gomez t-shirt.
Are you pulling my leg?
Nope. Once we got in the car he started listening to songs that Selena Gomez sings and telling me how much he loved her.
Why would you even consider going on the date with him if he showed up wearing a Selena Gomez t-shirt?
Because he was cute!
Listening to Selena Gomez at thirty-six is not cute, especially if you're a male!
I agree. Which is why we are not going on a second date.
Well, did he ask you for a second date?
Yup. He wanted to take me to a Selena Gomez concert.
You both would have stood out like a sore thumb in that crowd.
I know! We would have been old enough to be the parents of all the tween's!
