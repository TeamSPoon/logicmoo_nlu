There is so much talk about disney putting hidden messages or things in the movies. Have you noticed any?
I have in fact.
Like what? I have never seen anything at all!
Well the original vhs in the little mermaid had one. The priest at the end has noticable movement in his crotch area.
What, really? Are you certain?
Yes completely. It is there on it. Not sure if they changed it for DVD or later releases.
It is so bizarre they would do that at all.
I agree, also the dust in aladdin in one scene is said to spell the word sex.
I thought it was allegedly the genie saying something inappropriate when he was a bee.
I heard that one too. I think it is a little bit of a stretch but I can sort of hear it.
