Who is your favorite actor?
I really like Tom Hanks.
He has done some awesome movies.
What is your favorite movie of his.
That's easy, Forrest Gump.
I've seen that at least 15 times.
It's just such a good character.
Have you ever read the book?
No, I haven't read it.
In the book Forrest goes to space.
Somehow I don't doubt it.
My favorite Tom Hanks movie is castaway.
Is that the one with Wilson the volleyball.
That's the one.
Why is that your favorite?
It's shows how good an actor Tom Hanks is.
What do you mean?
You literally watch Tom Hanks on an island for over an hour and don't get bored.
He did do a really good job.
He will go downs as one of the best actors ever.
