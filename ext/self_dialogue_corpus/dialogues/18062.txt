I'm having a party this weekend and I was thinking about what music to play you got any recommendations
Sure you know I love music what type of party is it going to be
You know they back to type drink smoke dance a little bit
Then you know you got to have rap
How you say you that that you got to have rap
Because rap is your lead I music everybody dances to and shake their butt to
What type of rap songs do you recommend
You know the usual Club songs with like really heavy bass lines
What kind of songs have that really heavy bass lines
There's actually quite a few one  is that new Kendrick Lamar song
What song are you talking about you talking about humble
Yeah that's the one the Baseline on that song jobs like crazy
Okay I'll use that song you know if you can can you send me a list
