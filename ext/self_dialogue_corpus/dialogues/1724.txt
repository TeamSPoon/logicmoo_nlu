I love the NFL! Are you a fan?
Of course, it is awesome!
What is your favorite thing about the league?
I love the hard hits.  It makes the game very intense!
Really? I like watching long touchdown passes. There is nothing better than a deep bomb for a score.
Yeah, that is pretty nice. Who is the best quarterback throwing the deep ball?
Matt Ryan, hands down.
Why is that?
Have you seen the chemistry between him and Julio Jones?
Yeah, they make a great pair.
Who do you think is the best?
Drew Brees obviously!
He hasn't been great recently.
Yeah but over the past six years nobody has done it better than him.
Yeah the Saints are a very dynamic team.
Exactly.  Every game is high scoring and exciting
I think Carr will be the best eventually.
I agree, he has all the tools for success.
He just needs a better offensive line and he will be unstoppable.
I wouldn't want to be another team in the AFC West any time soon!
