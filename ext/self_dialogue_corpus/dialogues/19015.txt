You know who's really good?
Who?
Mumpherd and Sons.
Oh, yes I like them.
One of my favorites is the Cave.
Yeah I agree.   I like their folk and slightly Irish sound.
It is good.  It's just relaxing.
They do such a good job.
Another good one, I will wait.
Yes, for sure.  Maybe their best one.
I know what you mean.  You know what I love?
What?
Their acoustic sound.  It's something we don't get enough of today.
Yeah, I know what you mean.  Everything is synthetic today.
And they're just so real.
There's something pure about it.
Something you want more of.
It's a little rustic too, kind of like roasting food on a fire.
Yeah, that smokey feeling.
Perfect for fourth of July BBQ's.
