What are the Cavs doing?
I dont know man. Seems like their winning.
Thats what elite players do I guess.
Yea, Lebron just has it. He's the best there is.
Well I cant deny that. He just goes into another level in the playoffs.
Yea, he does. Its Lebron against the world.
Well Lebron is beating the world then.
Yea, he just puts his team on his back in the playoffs.
They finally experienced what it was like to struggle this year too.
Yea, they did and it helped.
Do you think they are better from it?
Have you seen them play? It sure looks like it.
Yea, I just haven't seen them play against any elite talent.
Me either, but they might have to eventually.
Well yea, with the Warriors.
They are just a tough team.
Yea, they have great players.
4 of them!
Yea, it's almost not fair.
Yea, thats been established.
