Do yo like the movie versions of books?
Sometimes but I like to read the book first.
Why's that?
It gives me insight into the characters.
That makes sense actually.
Whenever I see the movie first and then go back to read the book I learn something new about the characters.
I can see that.
What do you think?
I don't usually have time to read so the movie lets me at least know the story.
No time to read?
Not usually.
What movies have yo seen where you wanted to read the books?
The harry Potter ones definitely.
Oh, those are great books and movies both.
Lots of adventure but the books are so long.
The first few aren't too bad.
The last few books are huge.
Yeah.
I work too much to get the time to read them so I watched them all last weekend.
That sounds like a fun weekend.
