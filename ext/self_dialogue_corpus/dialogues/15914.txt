What you doing?
I was just sitting hear thinking about some of the weirdest or dumbest songs that were ever made.
Like which ones?
Remember Rick James and Eddie Murphy did that song Party All The Time?
Oh yeah right.Eddie Murphy swore he could sing. Rick James probably just did it for the money.
How about when MC Hammer and Deon Sanders did Pumps and the Bumps?
Now you tripping. The remix of that was the bomb. Pumps and the bumps, pumps and the bumps, give me the girl with the pumps and the bumps.
Man you crazy. How about all those parody songs that Weird Al used to make? That dude was crazy.
I remember he had that one called Eat It.
And he made the video mocking Michael Jackson's Beat It.
Man, I remember almost every song on that Beat It album was the truth.
That wasn't the Thriller album was it?
No, it was after Thriller. Bad.
Yeah that's right. Mike was that dude.
I still got Mike music in my phone to this day. I like Rock My World.
I like the video with him and Chris Tucker.
I got a Remember The Time remix in my phone. I think I got it from soundcloud.
Soundcloud be having all them live remixes though. Stuff folk ain't never heard of before.
That's what I do. I find an old song and look for a slamming remix to bring that thing back out.
They be having remixes from like London and stuff. Dee Jays over there be on point.
