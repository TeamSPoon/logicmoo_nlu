Have you ever seen a movie that made you laugh out loud?
A few. One was that Seth McFarlane one about the west.
That one was hilarious.
There are some decent Adam Sandler ones too.
That's true. Blended was funny.
I didn't like the Water Boy, though, because he was weird in it.
I agree. He was obnoxious in it.
Have you seen any other good ones with him?
Little Nicky was kind of funny.
I agree.
