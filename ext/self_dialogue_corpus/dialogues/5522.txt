I want to watch some  movie. Can you provide me some suggestions?
What kind of genre you want to watch?
Any animated movie would work.
Any other preference that you have?
It should be a top rated movie. Preferably in Top 250 of Internet Movie Data Base (IMDB).
You can watch Up. It is one of the most touching movies I have ever seen.
What is the plot?
It's a story of an old man named Carl who gets stuck with a boy when he is trying to fly by tying balloons to his house.
Oh! It sounds very interesting.
Yes, watch it. It is full of emotions and comedy.
