Do you like horror movies?
I actually love horror movies. It's hard to find anyone to watch them with me though.
What ones do you like?
I don't like really gory films, but more suspenseful/scary ones.
They're coming out with a new "IT" movie in September 2017.
I know, I am definitely going to go see it. I loved the first one.
The first one was awesome. It'll be hard to top it.
One of the scariest scenes is when the kids look through the photos and Pennywise appears in them.
Yeah that was scary. The sewer parts were always super scary, too.
I agree, except for the ending with the spider. Looked too fake to me.
I can see how you'd feel that way. It was harder back them to make things look super realistic.
I don't think anyone will play a better Pennywise than Tim Robbins. I mean, he was exceptional in that part.
He was. His facial expressions give off so much character.
Do you remember him in the movie, "Home Alone 2"? He was the hotel concierge?
Yes, he was funny.
Do you like the "Home Alone" movies?
I did when I was a kid, but not really anymore. Do you?
They're alright. I'm not a huge fan of Macauly Culkin to be honest.
Neither am I.
I think no matter what, the "Home Alone" movies will always remain holiday classics.
