What Disney films do you like?
Honestly, I have enjoyed almost all I have ever seen. I love Aladdin.
Same here. Robin Williams was phenomenal as the Genie. And Scott Weigner as Aladdin!
Robin Williams was fantastic. And yes, Scott Weigner was great, too.
Abu was my favorite character. Such a cute monkey!
I liked him too. I thought the magic carpet was sweet, too, even though it didn't talk.
What'd you think of the ending?
I loved it. It was scary when Jafar put Jasmine into the hourglass and she started drowning in sand.
How about when he turned into a snake?
Even scarier! He was a scary villain.
