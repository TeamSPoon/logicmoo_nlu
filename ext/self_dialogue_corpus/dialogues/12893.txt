The special effects in Star Wars are some of the greatest in movie history!
I agree, there was a lot of new technology in them when they first came out.
The puppets in the movies are spectacular, and they looks so real in some of the scenes.
Some of Tattooine is still around, they just built it in the dessert.
Did you know that some of the sound effects are just crazy combos of everyday stuff.  Like the Tie Fighter is an elephant mixed with a car driving over wet pavement.
That is insane how they can make those sounds out of something so different.
I love the scenery in some of the planets too.  Especially the Hoth, the snow is beautiful.
That always was one of my favorite scenes to watch, the fighting and all of the action.
Even the wampa that they stuffed Luke inside was pretty cool, a little gross.
It looked so real though!
