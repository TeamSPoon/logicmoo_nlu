Do you think Kendrick Lamar could beat Eminem in a rap battle?
Kendrick is very good, but I don't think anyone is going to beat Eminem.
I actually feel like their styles are similar, but different in a way.
Yeah, but Eminem is a battle rapper. Kendrick would be scared.
True, I doubt he would even accept the offer.
I don't know if anyone would.
No rapper ever says anything bad about Eminem. He's like untouchable.
They know he could end any of their careers.
Still, I think Kendrick would put up the best fight.
That I can agree with. It would be interesting, for sure.
