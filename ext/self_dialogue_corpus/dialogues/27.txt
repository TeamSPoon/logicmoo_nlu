Have you ever seen Guardians of the Galaxies?
Oh, I loved the soundtrack to that movie!
It was great wasn't it?
The movie was good, but the music was awesome!
Have you seen the second one?
Not yet, but I've heard the music.
How is the music?
It's pretty horrible.
Really?
Yeah, it's too slow and light.  Not like the first movie.
