What's your favorite Disney movie?
I love Mulan. It's so full of girl power!
I've never watched it before. What's it about?
Well, the main girl, Mulan, takes her father's place to train and fight in the Chinese army. She pretends to be a man the entire time, while learning how to fight.
That sounds exciting and frightening at the same time! She got caught eventually, right?
Oh definitely. But the general didn't have her killed since she previously saved his life.
So what happens next?
Mulan saves the day by defeating her enemies all by herself and becomes a respected member in her family.
Wow, sounds like I definitely have to watch this. I can't believe I haven't heard of Mulan until you told me.
You will not regret watching it. After the end of the movie, I bet that you'll want to sign up for martial arts lessons!
