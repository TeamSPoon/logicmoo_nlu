I was watching a catwalk, and some of them were rubbish.
Was it in USA/?
nO IT WAS IN PARIS.
What kind of dresses were they?
They were like short women dresses, and selection was haphazard.
Actually, fashion can not be generalized.
what do you mean?
Everyone is different, and people prefer and choose according to their job or occasion.
What is your favorites?
I long evening gowns.
They are very reasonable in some stores.
Is there any in jcpenney?
May be, but I saw some on online. very pretty. You can check it out.
I actually prefer with embroidery and colorful.
You should check online for sure, specially from china.
I do not trust so much as sometime chinese material are not good.
Yes, that is the negeative point about online.
I am thinking to get some in this week.
You should buy from top rated business.
good idea
