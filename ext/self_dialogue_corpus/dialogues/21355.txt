Are you going to go see Gaurdians of the Galaxy 2 this weekend?
I still have not seen the first one yet but many of my coworkers told me I need to. Are you going this weekend?
Yes I am! Do you think you will find time to watch the first Guardians of the Galaxy movie? If so, then you might be able to come with me this weekend.
It's not a super long movie like the last one you recommended is it? Between my job and family I hardly have three hours to dedicate to a movie these days.
What do you mean the last King Kong movie? I didn't honestly recommend it as much as I said it would be nice to see the last version before the new one comes out.
Well even though I still got sucked into watching a three hour movie because of your recommendations but I think I will give Guardians of the Galaxy a try.
I am positive you will like it! Anything featuring Chris Pratt is essentially comedic gold!
Why does that name sound so familiar? Was he the main actor from the new Jurassic Park movie?
Yes he was! So you do watch movies without someone pointing you in the right direction?
You think to highly of me Jason. That movie was purely the girlfriends choice.
Oh come on! You must have some interest in seeing movies yourself! Have you seen any good movie trailers lately?
The new Baywatch movie looks good!
Really Tim? The new Baywatch is what has peaked your interest?
What can I say? I am a sucker for a nostalgic remake.
But its Baywatch. What nostalgic moments are you actually trying to remember?
Hey! Do not try to pretend like you wouldn't see a remake of your precious Fight Club?
Only because Fight Club is on a whole different level from Baywatch! Brad Pitt and Edward Norton are acting gods!
Well the new Baywatch movie is going to have Dwayne Johnson!
Did you really just put Dwayne Johnson on the same level as Edward Norton and Brad Pitt?
You know I think we should probably just get back to work. I am not trying to avoid the rest of this conversation at all.
