What do you think about the new Marvel movies?
Like Guardians of the Galaxy and the Avengers movies?
Yea, what do you think?
I really like them, they casted them all really well.
Yeah, especially the Avengers.
Robert Downey Jr. is so perfect as Iron Man.
His acting style suits Tony Stark well.
I see what you did there.
Have you seen the most recent Guardians of the Galaxy?
Yeah, it was pretty awesome.
There was some great writing and dialogue for that movie.
They're building those characters stories well.
I really didn't know or care about them but they did a great job.
Disney generally does a really good job with the stories they get.
Yeah, have you seen their recent animated movies?
Not really, the most recent was Moana.
I think that was the most recently released animated movie from Disney.
Oh, hahaha, whoops, then yeah.
I thought the voice actors were so-so.
I really liked the Rock though.
