What was the last Harry Potter movie you saw?
I saw one of the Deathly Hallows.
It was cool to see them out of school.
The three friends stayed together.
Yeah, they got into fights, but always ended it well.
I thought Ron was going to leave the Horcrux hunt for good.
Do you think Harry and Hermione should have gotten together?
I think it would have been cool for Harry to have had a totally different girlfriend.
Yeah, it seems like there aren't that many people if you want to choose a wizard.
Harry Potter was famous, I'm sure he didn't have problems with the ladies.
