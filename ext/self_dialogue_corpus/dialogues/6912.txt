I think 'A Whole New World' was the best Disney song ever.
You're crazy.
Not at all.  What's better?
Hello, Elton John?  Lion King?
Which one are you talking about?
Can You Feel the Love Tonight?  Strike a bell?
Yeah, I heard it at every dance that year.
Best Disney song ever, not even close.
It wasn't even the best song in that movie!
I'm not sure if we can be friends anymore.
