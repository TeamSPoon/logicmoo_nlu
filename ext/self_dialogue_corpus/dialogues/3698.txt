I wished there was something decent on to watch!
We could just stream a movie if you want.
That is fine, I want to watch a thriller.
How about Cold Creek Manor?
Never heard of it, anyone famous in it?
Sure, Dennis Quaid and Sharon Stone are in it.
Wow, with them in it I am guessing it is pretty good.
That is some good star power there.
I think we should give it a try!
Sounds good, I hope it is a good one!
