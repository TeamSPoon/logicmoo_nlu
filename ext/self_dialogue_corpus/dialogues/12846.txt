What did you think about 'Rogue One?'
I absolutely loved it.  It was so much more serious in tone and plot than the other movies.
It was a refreshing new take on the whole franchise.  Are you excited about the other anthology movies?
What is coming up next in terms of Star Wars anthology?
Well, the next anthology standalone movie is the young Han Solo film.
I did not know that was happening!
Yup.  It is set to come out in 2018.
I don't think I can wait that long.  Who will be in the cast?
Well for starters, Donald Glover will play young Lando.  Also, the movie will star Emilia Clarke, Woody Harrelson, and Thandie Newton.
That is a star-studded cast.  I love all of those actors, so I'm really excited !
