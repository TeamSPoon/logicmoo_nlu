Who do you think is the greatest player to ever play basketball?
You can't pick just one.
That's why I asked who do YOU think is the greatest.
I can tell you my favorites first
Go on.
Well, I guess we could to the ranking by the scoring leaders first.
Ok. Fine, whatever.
Let's see the player with the most points over career is Karem Abdul Jabbar, but that's a bad metric.
Howzat?
Because not many people can stay healthy and play as many games as Jabbar did.
How many games and how many points?
Jabbar played 1560 games and scored 38387 points.
So that's about 24 points per game
More or less.
So what happens if we use the points per game metric, who's the greatest?
That will bring us to my favorite player. Michael Jordan, with 30.12 points per game.
how does he rank in terms of total life points?
You mean points over his career, he ranks 4th behind, Jabbar, Malone, and believe it or not Bryant.
How many games did Jordan play?
he played 1072 games and scored 32292 points. Almost 500 games less than Jabbar.
