What did you think about Han Solo's and Princess Leia's son?
Kalo Ren?  He was okay.
I liked his light saber and his helmet.
I didn't like his room.  Particularly the belt in the middle.
I liked captain phasma's look.
Yeah, interesting to see a silver colored storm trooper.
I like all the little robots.
Yeah, it's interesting that they can make robots have personalities.
Are you going to see the new one in December?
Of course!
