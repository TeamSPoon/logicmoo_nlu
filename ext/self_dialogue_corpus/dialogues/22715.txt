Did you see the first Avengers?
I did actually and loved it.
That's great to hear.
What did you like most about it?
Just the forming of the team and learning and seeing how they all function as a team.
I just loved how it was this epic team being thrown together and they just winged it all the time.
yeah they tried to get organized but hulk smashes things as usual.
Who is your favorite avenger?
Captain America he is the golden boy if you will pure of heart and always does the right thing.
He's not that super though yeah he's strong fast and can jump high but he's no thor.
I agree but that's also why I like him he's not over the top like Hulk or anything like that.
That's a fair point hawkeye is on the team too so he is just a good shot.
What about you?
I like Hulk the most.
Really? Why?
Well he's unpredictable plus he's always fighting a battle for inner peace.
That's true he can go all crazy at times but he's a monster.
A monster in a good way.
Glad he was on the Avengers side.
Me too.
