Have you seen the movie "Max"?
No, I haven't seen it.  Tell me about it.
It's an inspiring movie about a German sheperd that retires from the service and needs adoption.
Sounds great-I love German sheperds
This movie will have you both in tears and cheering.
It sounds awesome-I would love to see it with another dog lover.
I definitely love dogs-do you want to go with me?
definitely-and anybody else who is in dog rescue and loves dogs.
Do you know anyone in the service who has had a canine partner?
As a matter of fact, I do and they probably would love this movie.
I will ask on my Facebook about people who might like to see this movie.
Who is in the movie?
Not sure about the actors-some not so well known actors, I think.
That doesn't matter-the dog is the star of the movie.
The dog in the movie is awesome and very well trained.
Those dogs that are canine service dogs in the Army are very intelligent.
The dog in the movie is definitely a good representative for the dogs in the military.
Who produced the movie?
Not sure, but I think it might be a Disney movie.
great-looking forward to seeing "Max".
