How much do you put into a pitchers record?
None at all.
I disagree
But how? He cant control everything
You want your ace on the mound and you want a win
But if he gives up 1 run over 8 and the offense doesnt score?
How often does that happen?
OK even if he gives up 2 over 7 and they score 1 run.
OK i can see your point slightly.
I value ERA over everything.
You are probably right.
The record doesnt state a whole lot.
So just get rid of them?
You cant do that
Then how would you fix it.
Maybe show the record in games he starts
Some guys get no run support
Like Cole Hamels?
Yeah just like him
So basically no Cy Young award winner should be based on record alone.
