Do you know the first Hip Hop rap hit?
I think it's "Rappers Delight" by the Sugarhill Gang.
Did you know that singer "Angie Stone" was one of the original members?
Get out! But you know that "Good Times" song is used as the hook in Rappers Delight?
Oh snap, no I didn't.
What year did "Rappers Delight" come out?
It was late 1979. I remember because that was the year I first heard "Foxy's" "Get Off!"
Is that the same year the rap record "Don't Push Me Cause I'm Close To The Edge" came out?
No, that song came out much later.
"Rappers Delight" must be your favorite rap song since you know so much about it.
