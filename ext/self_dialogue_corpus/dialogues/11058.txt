Do you think the all star game should be eliminated?
Yes I think its a waste of time
How about the skills competition?
That would be the only thing I would keep
Yeah I dont watch the game anymore, its too weird
No one does. It is stupid.
Be like the NFL and hold it after the main games.
Well people tune into the MLB all star game.
Then go to MLB and find out what theyre doing right.
I think its the style of the sport.
Well people would love the skills competition
They should beef it up
Not much more they can do.
Id like to see Crosby try a different sport
That would probably be comedic but not interesting
Maybe play other sports on ice?
Risky injuries doing weird stuff.
I think theyd be safe they know their bodies
They do but youre doing something that has no precedent.
People would tune in though to see it.
