I'm dying to see that new Annabelle movie?
Which one is that?
Its called Annabelle Creation and its about that doll that's possessed.
Did that come from those Conjuring movies somehow?
I think so.  I remember that now that you said something.
Yeah, the doll was in the beginning when the couple were talking about some cases they solved.
Speaking of, I really liked the Conjuring. Patrick Wilson was good in that.
He was.  He's never really blown me away though with his acting.
Did you know that movie is based off of real people?
Yeah, Ed and Lorraine Warren?
