Have you seen Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban?
Yeah I have ! That's probably my favorite!
Really ? Why? That's my least.
I love that they travel back in time !
I personally prefer the goblet of fire. That one is so cool and action packed.
I like that one too. I love the maze at the end even though the ending is so sad for Cedric Diggory.
I agree. It's also pretty scary, that graveyard scene was done well.
Poor Harry having to experience that.
I would be so traumatized watching that death.
Me too. And to come back with the body like that.
