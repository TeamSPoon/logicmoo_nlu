I need a good horror movie to watch; can you recommend anything new?
Have you seen Get Out yet?
No, but I heard about it. Tell me more.
It is Jordan Peele's first movie as director and he has a good knack for creating suspense and creepy situations.
Isn't he that guy from SNL?
Yeah, and there is a comic relief character, but sometimes you need the relief because the movie is so intense.
So is it like a horror-comedy?
It is mostly horror, and commentary on how supposedly non-racist liberal whites exploit black Americans.
Whoa that sounds heavy. Is it preachy, though?
Nope, but the social commentary is really unsettling.
