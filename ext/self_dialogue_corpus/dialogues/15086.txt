Hey, so what did you do last night?
Watched The Big Lebowski.
Really? Again? That's like the millionth time you've watched that movie!
What can I saw? I can't get enough of John Goodman.
Yeah, he's pretty awesome, in just about everything he's in.
Yeah, plus Jeff Bridges. Mr. Tron himself.
Tron?
Oh come on, you haven't seen Tron? That's an 80s classic?
Well, I was thinking Steve Buscemi when you mentioned The Big Lebowski.
Oh man, Buscemi is great!
