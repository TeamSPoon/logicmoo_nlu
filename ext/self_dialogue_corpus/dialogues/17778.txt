Do you ever just listen to film scores?
All the time. I love Rachel Portman.
I've never heard of her. What's she done?
Oh, so much. But her score for Never Let Me Go must be my favorite.
What's it sound like?
It's very orchestral. I absolutely love the strings she uses.
Do you have any other favorites?
I like the Midnight in Paris soundtrack, as well as Yann Tiersen, but not much beyond that. What about you?
I've been on a big Jon Brion kick lately. He did the soundtrack for Eternal Sunshine for the Spotless Mind.
Jon Brion? He's worked with Fiona Apple and Rufus Wainwright, two of my favorites!
Really? I love Fiona but I'm not familiar with Rufus.
Rufus is amazing. His voice is so recognizable so you might have heard him and not realize it.
What are some of his popular songs?
He covered "He Ain't Heavy, He's My Brother" like ten years ago. "Going to a Town" is getting a lot of play lately.
I'll have to check him out sometime. Are there any artists similar to him?
Well, his sister is a singer. Martha Wainwright.
I never knew that. How similar are they?
A bit, but they're both unique and have their own styles. I guess Rufus doesn't really sound like anybody else in my mind.
Well, that's a great thing to be in music: unapologetically unique.
He's that, and it's great. I can listen to him playing piano and singing all day long.
