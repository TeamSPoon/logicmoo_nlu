Patriots ran 117 yards per game last season. Cowboys gave up 83.6 yards.
Oh wait I was wrong then. The ratio greater than 1 doesn't mean offense is good, it means it facing tougher opponent.
What?
I said earlier.. here look. Pat's 117 yards/game divided by Cowboy's 83.6 yards/game is equal to 1.39. This Doesn't mean the Pats will hve better time running, it means Pats will struggle against the Cowboy's run defense.
Wait, can we check this against last year's record?
I guess we could, let see who has a similar run record as the Pats in NFC?
Let's see. Pats ran 117 yards per game, so that would be... Either falcons with 120 or Panthers with 113 yrads per game
Let's look at how Cowboys' defense did against Falcons.  Wait... They didn't play Falcons last year. Let's check panthers
They didn't play the Panthers either... Let's try San Francisco, they ran 126 yards/game.
Ok. Dallas won that game 24-17. Now we have a game to check out metric against. So we have 49er's 126 yards/game gained average against cowboys 83.5 yards/games allowed
which is about 1.5. This should be analyzed how?
Well, we have to look at the data now. We need to run stat from that game
From the Cowboys/49ers game?
No, from the Cowboys and Pats game, Of course from the Cowboys/49ers game!
Dallas dominated the yards 428 for cowboys to 295 for 49ers
What was the run allwoed for the niners?
106 yards for the game, but they averaged 126 yard for the season.
Which means the runs were 84% of their season average with a decrease of 16%, so the metric of run offense vs run defense of 1.5 is correlated with 16% decrease in runs.
What does that tell you?
Maybe this thing woriks... we have to repeat this for all the teams. I need to write a program to do this.
