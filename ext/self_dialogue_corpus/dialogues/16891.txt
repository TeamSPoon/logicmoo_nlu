Do you like the Band Huey Lewis and the News?
I love Heuy! They were my favorite band in high school.
I'll admit I listened to them quite a bit.
Who doesn't love The Power of Love?
Seriously! It's a great song!
That whole album is just amazing.
It really is.
Do you know if they still tour?
I'm pretty sure they do.
Yeah I think I saw flyers for a show.
I hope they still sound good.
I'm sure they sound alright.
I always liked Back in Time too.
I don't know if I've heard that one.
You should look it up!
Do you think I'll like it?
Totally. It sounds very much like them.
Okay I'll look when I get home.
And I'll see if they are still doing shows.
Okay get back to me.
