Have you heard the new blink-182 album?
The one they did with Matt Skiba?
Yeah, I had my reservations because legacy and all that but it's actually really good.
That's great to hear though like you have I had and still have my reservations.
Original lineups are always preferred but when an original lineup is getting no results why not shuffle around?
You have a point but when I think of blink-182 I think of the way Mark and Tom play off of each other.
That was always their defining quality but I think they maintain what with Matt Skiba.
Oh wait I forgot it was Matt Skiba who replaced Tom, that makes me feel better.
Yeah getting someone of his caliber in the band helped with the transition tremendously.
I'm really excited to hear it now, does it have Alkaline Trio vibes?
Sort of but not really, it's a lot more classic blink than Alkaline Trio.
Oh that's kind of a bummer to hear but good on the classic blink though.
Not to say there aren't flashes of Alkaline Trio on the record, just not as much as some were hoping.
I'm going to listen to it as soon as I get out of work.
They're playing a show up in Hershey if you were interested.
Is getting me to listen to the new album a way to get me to go to the show?
Maybe, not often you get to see punk legends united on a stage.
That is true, the thought of seeing Mark Hoppus and Matt Skiba on the same stage is exciting.
Let me know what you think, the album is called California.
Of course it's called California.
