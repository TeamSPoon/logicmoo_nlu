Who do you think are the best NFL quarterbacks?
I think Tom Brady is very good.
He is but I feel he has a very good offense around him that helps him a lot.
That's true. I've also always been a big fan of Drew Brees.
I think he's a great player and a great guy.
I was glad to see that he plans to play another season.
Yeah I saw some questions arising about his contract extension.
He mentioned that he wants to win another championship. Basically confirming he'll continue to play.
That's good. He really is fun to watch.
I think Andrew Luck is great, too.
I always forget to consider him. He is very impressive.
You can't talk quarterbacks without talking about Matt Ryan, also.
His arm was so scary last year. He was throwing rockets.
Precision rockets at that.
Aaron Rodgers is really great too.
He's coming up on 300 touchdowns.
I saw that. He'll definitely hit it this coming season.
He'll be one of only 10 quarterbacks to do so.
Yeah, and he'll be the only one to have done it with less than 100 interceptions thrown.
Really? That's just shows how talented he is.
