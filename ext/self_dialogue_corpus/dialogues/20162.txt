I have never laughed so hard in my life as I have watching "Ted".
Me either, I love the premise behind the story and that they made the personality of the bear grow into an adult as Walburg's character grew.
The thunder buddies song sticks in my head , I swear everytime it thunders, I have to sing it to the dog to calm him down.
That is funny, bless his heart afraid of the thunder. Good thing you are thunder Buddies for life!
I thought it was cool how they had the bear always checking out Mila
I think he would have made a play if he thought she was into fluffy guys!
No way, he was too good of friends with Walhburg.
Maybe, he did fall to pieces when he got his own place.
That bear can sure party.
When he got caught having a party with those ladies of the evening, i about lost it laughing.
I felt sorry for him when his spirit was about to go, made me want to cry.
Mee too, but I think it all turned out well.
I do too, the cast was great, can't think of one person I would have replaced.
me either, great flix to take a date too or great friends night out movie.
It definately moved along and had great writing.
There are some really good lines in there that is for certain.
Are you looking forward to part 2 ?
Absolutely, I will probably ge the set when it comes out in stores
Hinting for  a Christmas present there?
but of course!
