I have been listening to some older music lately.
What kind?
Queen specifically.
I think I have heard of them.
You probably have, their music is used in a lot of movies and shows even today. Even though they were mostly an 80's band.
Oh really?
Yeah. Hard to find a sports event without "We Will Rock You"
Oh yeah, I didn't know that was them.
Yep, they have a lot good songs beside that too.
Like what?
I am a big fan of Killer Queen and Somebody to Love.
Sell me on them.
If you like vocal harmony and some electric guitar, you'll like Queen.
I do, I guess I need to check em out.
You do, they are a big part of classic rock.
Any other songs I might like?
I definitely would say check out Bohemian Rhapsody.
Oh I think I have heard of that, from Wayne's World right?
Right, it was in that movie. It is a great piece of music that is a little crazy.
A little crazy is what I like.
