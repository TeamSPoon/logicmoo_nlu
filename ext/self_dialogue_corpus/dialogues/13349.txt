Did you see The Force Awakens?
I think so, was that the one about the Death Star?
Well, no that was Rogue One, this one occurred after Return of Jedi
Okay, but I thought there was a Death Star in this one too
No, there was a planet like the Death Star that blew things up
But isn't that what the Death Star is?
No, the Death Star is a space station not a planet
But I thought it was as big as a planet
No, more like the size of a small moon
I'm so confused
