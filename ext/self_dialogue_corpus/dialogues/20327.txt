Are you excited to see the new Descpicable Me movie?
I am! I have to say the second was my least favorite, the first is the best in my opinion.
I agree, the first was the best. Steve Carell makes a great Gru.
He does. I like Miranda Cosgrove as Margo.
Next to Gru, Agnes is my favorite character. She's adorable!
She is. It's cute how she loves unicorns.
I loved the part when Gru blew up the carnival game to win her the unicorn.
Me too! He had no choice, the carnival barker was being unfair. She hit the spaceship!
The roller coaster part made me queasy, but the graphics were pretty cool.
I love the minions. They are so funny.
They are! Have you seen the movie Minions?
Believe it or not, I haven't. I love Despicable Me, but have yet to see Minions.
Oh you should definitely check it out, it's awesome!
Who does the voices for that movie?
Pierre Coffin is the voice of the minions, Sandra Bullock is in it, Jon Hamm and Michael Keaton.
Oh I like Michael Keaton, he's awesome.
He was great in Beetlejuice.
Oh yeah, he was the best. That's such a classic.
I even enjoyed Alec Baldwin in that film, even though I'm not usually a Baldwin fan.
I like Geena Davis. She's a great actress.
