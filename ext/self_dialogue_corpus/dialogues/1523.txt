Did you watch the Super Bowl last year?
Yeah, I watch it every year.
What did you think about it?
I think it's definitely the best comeback I've ever seen in a Super Bowl, and maybe in any football game.
It was really crazy wasn't it?
Yeah, I still can't believe it happened.
The Falcons will never get over that. They completely fell apart.
I bet a lot of people stopped watching the game around the 3rd quarter.
I thought about it. I kept watching mainly to see the commercials.
It's a good thing you stuck around!
I know! I'm so glad I got to see the whole game.
Do you think that game solidified Tom Brady as the best quarterback ever?
Yes I do. He was already amazing, but that game put him over the top.
So who is on your Mount Rushmore of quarterbacks?
I would have Brady, Montana, Elway, and Bradshaw.
Bradshaw is an interesting choice. You don't hear him being mentioned all that often.
People forget how good he was. I think it might be because he's a goofy TV personality now.
I would have Tom Brady, Joe Montana, Dan Marino, and Steve Young.
It's a shame that Marino never won a Super Bowl.
Yeah, I know. But I don't hold that against him. He's still one of the best ever.
