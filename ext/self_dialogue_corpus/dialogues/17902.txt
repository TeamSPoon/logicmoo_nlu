So what's been in your music player lately?
I've been listening to a lot of different stuff, but I'd say mostly country hits.
Oh awesome!  Is LeAnn Rhymes still around?
Oh yeah, she released a new single in 2016 in the UK.  It was called The Story.
I haven't heard of that one.  I know Blue was amazing when it came out.
Yeah that was her first album in 1996 right?
Yeah, and people compared her to Patsy Cline which was a pretty huge honor.
Yeah, I'll say.  I saw her as the opening act for Alan Jackson around that time.
Oh I bet that was pretty incredible!
It was, they both put on a great show.
I remember One Way Ticket, didn't it come out around the same time?
Yeah I think it was the same album.
So what's her newer stuff like?
It's similar, but she crossed over a little bit more into pop along with country music.
That tends to happen a lot.
Yeah, and she had one album that was mostly just a remake of Patsy Cline songs believe it or not.
Oh wow, I never heard that!  I bet it sounded great.
Yeah, they do have a lot of similarities in their sound.  It was pretty good.
I wonder what she'll come out with next.
I don't know.  I bet there will be something soon though.
