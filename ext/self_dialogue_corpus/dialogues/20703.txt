Have you heard about the new Tupac movie?
I heard about it, but I'll wait until it comes to DVD.
You aren't interested in it?
It's probably an interesting story, but there are people saying the story is off.
Like it's not true?
Yeah, I guess it's overly glamorized.
Oh, that sucks.
Yeah, you can't really trust Hollywood with true stories.
I guess not.  I was just excited for this.
Yeah, I kind of was at first, but after reading articles, I don't know.
I guess I might think twice.
It might be a good movie regardless.
Yeah, I'll think about it.
Who plays Tupac anyway?
I don't know the name of the guy.
Yeah, I think I remember reading his name somewhere, but it didn't ring a bell.
I wonder if he was a good actor.
I don't know.  They either got him for his acting skills or because he resembled Tupac.
I did notice that he looked a good bit like him.
Maybe that had a good bit to do with casting then.
