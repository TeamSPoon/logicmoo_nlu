Did you see the remake of Pete's Dragon?
Yes I did. Did you like it?
Well it was different than the original. I can tell you that originally I wasn't happy they remade it.
I never saw the original so I had nothing to compare it to.
It was actually in many ways different and that was a good thing because I felt like I didn't have to compare the two.
I really liked how they showed that there were lots of dragons actually living in harmony somewhere.
Sure, but I thought that the relationship with Pete and the family that found him was great. They really developed that storyline
I am glad they didn't make it a musical.
I thought that the CGI was really great. The dragon looked so real.
The CGI was fantastic. It was like the dragon was really there interacting with the people. He was not cartoon looking either.
