Hey do you watch hocley at all?
Yeah I do. Why?
Have you been watching the Stanley Cup playoffs?
Yeah it's been intense!
Who are you rooting for?
Senators, for sure. Today's game is gonna be good.
Aw man! I hate the sentators!
Well I kind of have to be a fan, I am Canadian after all!
Oh yeah that's right. Did you play growing up?
Yeah, I played through high school but didn't make the cut in college. You?
Just in high school. I grew up in the south so it's not very common! haha
Who are you rooting for?
I don't really care either way to be honest.
Why not?
The Bruins are out!
A Bruins fan from the south?
Yeah I went to college in Boston. Sports fans there are intense!
Yeah that's true. When they won the cup in 2011 that was a pretty sweet game.
Wanna grab a beer when the game's on later?
Sounds good, man!
