Hey man, did you ever see Dragon Heart?
With Sean Connery?
Yeah, that's the one.
Yeah, it was pretty good.
I thought so too.
Did you know they made a sequel?
No. They did?
Yup.
How was it?
Terrible!
Could have figured.
They didn't even have any of the original cast.
I don't think Connery does sequals.
Yeah, none come to mind.
My favorite character in the original was Dennis Quaid.
He is pretty darn good.
He doesn't do much these days.
Yeah, sad.
He's such a good actor.
Agreed.
