So did you hear about the new Alien movie?
Yeah, I saw the trailer when I went to see Guardians of the Galaxy 2.
What did you think of it?
I don't know, it seemed interesting. Is it going to have the girl from the first one?
Sigorney Weaver? Nah, this one's based on the Prometheus series.
Ugh, I hated Prometheus.
I haven't seen it myself, I've only seen Alien and Aliens.
The only ones worth seeing, to be honest,
What was so bad about Prometheus?
So in the original Alien, you cared about the characters, right?
Yeah, for sure! It was so sad when that one girl got grabbed by the tentacles especially.
Exactly. In this one, there were just a ton of characters that you didn't care about and didn't really matter.
But surely that's not all there was, right?
Definitely not. The dialogue was bad, the plot holes were so large you could drive a truck through them, it was just a disaster.
Ouch. Do you think this one's going to be as bad?
I don't know, it depends on whether the same people wrote this film. The trailer didn't seem so bad anyway.
Do you think I should watch Prometheus before this one?
Nah, just read a summary online somewhere and save your time.
Okay. Maybe I'll just watch Aliens again instead.
Now that, my friend, is an excellent idea!
