How do you prefer to watch movies?
By myself I guess.
I mean do you like going to the theater?
Not really, I stream alot.
From your cable box?
Yeah or from Netflix.
So you dont like seeing new releases?
I dont mind going once in a while but the cost is too much.
I dont blame you sometimes you can spend almost $100.
Yeah so I can wait a couple months for it to come On Demand.
Some of the movies they offer on demand are old
Normally the premium channels can get some good ones
Do you like HBO to watch movies?
No I like Showtime to be honest.
I think HBO has some good programming.
Yeah but their movie selection lacks most times.
I dont like the fee Comcast charges to watch movies
Yeah its part of the process though.
I guess Hollywood is never going to go the streaming route.
They will in a couple of years.
