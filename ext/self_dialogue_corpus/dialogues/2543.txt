Pre-Season  is just about here. I can't wait
yea it's really starting to feel like football
Who is your favorite team
I'm a raider fan
Oh wow Raiders moving to Las Vegas pretty soon
Yea it might be a little weird at first but what a great city for football
I'm a Viking fan
Oh wow the Super Bowl is in Minnesota this year.
Yes it is and I'm hoping the Vikings can be there
They had a great start last season
Yea , the injuries caught up to them last season
They had a killer defense early on
I think the Vikings need to be able to stretch the field with a deep passing game it will really help the running game.
How do feel about A Peterson being gone?
I'm actually glad AP is out.  I think the vikings have some good young backs
Right , Im hoping the Raiders will also improve on last season.
Well they have A fantastic QB I wish Minnesota had a QB like the Raiders
Yes , If the Raiders can clean up the Defense they have a good chance to go pretty far in 2017
I agree well let's hope its The Vikings and Raiders in Minnesota for the Super Bowl
Oh wow A rematch like 40 years later that would be fun
