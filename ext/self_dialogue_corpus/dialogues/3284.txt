Do you like horror movies?
Sometimes, but I hate being scared.
Stop by a punk, why are you scared so easy?
It just gives me nighmares and I'd rather not watch them at night.
So you watch them in the day time?
Yes, that is the only time I can.
I really like watching them at night in the dark.
Why is that.
It gives me and thrill and I try to guess when the action is coming.
You are funny and it is probably fun to watch a movie with you.
