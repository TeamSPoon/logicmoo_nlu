Did you like Clone Wars?
Episode two of Star Wars, yes I did.
Did you like they way they made Padme and Anakin fall in love.
I think they were already in love, at least he was, when they first met on Tatooine.
But she was so much older than him.
Not really, he was an adult by then, twenty, she was twenty four.
Wow, she did a lot by then in the movies.
She was a queen at sixteen and a senator by twenty, so yes she did.
I think she was too smart for him, all the things she did.
She was, but there was also the force at play, the danger of the dark side and the light side pushing them to one another.
