I just saw the oddest Dracula movie ever.
There are tons, which one?
Dracula Untold, it kinda puts you in mind of Van Helsing visually.
I have seen Dracula Untold, I thought it was a rather unique twist.
historically, Vlad was a hero to his people for fighting the turks. Seems like a natural vision for the Hollywood figure and historical one.
I like how they kept it where he was seeking power to defend his people, but that  and the reffernce to the Dracula name  are probably the only historical facts.
No, remember the scene where they showed briefly the people up on pikes impaled?
Yeah , kinda. Why?
The actual Vlad the Impaler done that! He commanded a forest of 10,000 people be planted via impaling to greet the hoards.
I did not know that1
Indeed, and in the uncut version, he is sitting on a throne like alter dipping his bread in the blood of his enemies like its gravy!
Wow! That would be freaky to ride into and see.
Psychological warfare is a part of warfare. I like how they made his wife actually stand by him, and not some whaf in a trance.
I never understood why they would choose to go that route with his wife anyway.
I figure it was, in older movies, a statement towards the male dominance of society.
Well the original Nosferatu was ugly as sin, from the trailor, the guy that plays Dracula is very nice looking.
They pay homage to Nosferatu, I believe that is who he visits in the cave when he seeks power.
How did Nosferatu get in a cave?
They didn't say it was Nosferatu exactly. When Dracula sought power, he went to the cave to talk to the thing trapped there.
oh, ok. That makes more sense.
