So, how do you feel about funk music?
I feel like Millennials don't really get it, or care for it.
Maybe it's sort of become dated, in the sense that lots of musical genres are "funky" now?
I don't know. I was on an online messageboard made up primarily of indie rock fans, and they said the only "funky" band they like is the Red Hot Chili Peppers.
That's weird. Because the Chili Peppers definitely absorbed seminal funk influences.
For sure, the stuff like George Clinton with Parliament and Funkadelic, for one.
Or the funky post-punk artists, like Gang of Four.
Yeah, if you listen to early Chili Peppers they sound like a Gang of Four tribute band, with sillier lyrics.
I feel like once hip-hop emerged, it stole fans away from live bands playing funk music.
I agree, and hip-hop has gotten less funky as it moved away from samples of James Brown and those types of guys.
But then you have the Roots, who are funky, and a live hip-hop band, and enormously popular.
Well, but the thing is, they're a live band on a talk show now, so they're more for aging Generation X-ers...
In other words, people who get more of the context for funk music, as opposed to rock or other genres.
Yeah. I think the issue is more that distinct musical genres aren't what they used to be.
So things like techno music and all its many, many offshoots are very "funky"...
But their fans won't really identify it as such.
So maybe we're just less into labeling things, which could be the issue.
Well, I find when Millennial music listeners talk about funk, they kind of mean funky hippie jam bands like Phish, which have a bad reputation.
You mean, they find them corny or outdated...
I think so. They need to hear the good stuff, like the Isley Brothers from the late Sixties and early Seventies.
