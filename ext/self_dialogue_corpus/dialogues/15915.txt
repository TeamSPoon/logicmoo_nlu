What CD are you putting on?
Warren Zevon, Greatest hits.
I love him.  I still can't believe he died.
Me either.
Did you see his last interview with David Letterman?
Yes.  He has such a great dry sense of humor.
Yeah, joking about not seeing a doctor in like twenty years.
Remember him saying his advice is to enjoy every sandwich.
There was a film about him on VHS or something.
I saw that.  Where all of his friends and fellow musicians were there.
I didn't get to see it.  Who was on it?
I remember Tom Perry and Jacson Brown.
Did they sing any of his songs?
Jackson Brown sang  'Poor, Poor Pitiful Me'.
I love that song!  Usually I don't like it when someone covers a song I like, but not this time.
That will be running through my head for a week now!
Aww!  Poor, poor pitiful you.
Ha, Ha.  Very funny.
What is your favorite Warren Zevon song?  Mine would have to be 'Roland the Headless Thompson Gunner'.
Love that, but I would say 'Accidently, Like a Martyr'.
