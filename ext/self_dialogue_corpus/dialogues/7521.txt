Finally caught up on Harry Potter yesterday!
How exciting! What did you think?
It was really emotional.
Yeah it can be. Who was your favorite?
I really loved all of the Weasleys, there were so many of them and there was a lot of growth.
Honestly, I loved the twins and I was so sad when Fred died.
Me too! I couldn't stop crying.
I felt so bad for George.
And Molly. Such a hard time for a mom.
But she was so badass in the end.
