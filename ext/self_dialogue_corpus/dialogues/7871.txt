I just finished watching Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix!
Oh wow! Isn't it great? What did you think?
I think it's interesting how much darker all of the movies keep getting as they progress through the series.
Same. I get so sad whenever I watch that movie and Sirius dies.
I know. It's so sad to see Harry losing the only real family member he's ever known.
That's true. The only good thing is that he has so many people who care about him that he'll always have a surrogate family in a sense.
I just have a feeling that the rest of the movie are going to get so dark that he'll probably keep losing people he loves.
Yeah, I'm not sure. What was your favorite part of the whole movie?
I liked the scene when they're in the Ministry of Magic and they're trying to save the Prophecy.
I also like when Professor Trelawney gives them divination readings. Everyone thinks she's crazy, but she actually knows what she's talking about.
