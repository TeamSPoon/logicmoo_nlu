Hey what do you think about NFL salaries compared to NBA salaries?
Both are raking in cash but the NFL players are definitely getting the short end of the stick.
Why do you say that?
Because there is no way James Harden should be making more money than any of the top 5 NFL quarterbacks.
I agree it's kind of silly James Harden makes more money than Tom Brady.
Exactly or Aaron Rodgers.
But the NBA doesn't have to pay as many players so they can afford to pay more.
That would be a good argument if both leagues made the same amount of revenue but that's not the case.
You think the NFL makes more revenue than the NBA?
They make close to four times more than the NBA.
Okay, that makes things a little different.
So when I hear people bring up the more players argument it's laughable.
You're right, the NFL players have a legitimate argument to make.
Of course they do but NFL players don't have as much power as NBA players.
Well I guess you can blame the NFLPA for that.
They are largely responsible but players share some of the blame as well.
If the NFL is making that much more money than the NBA, they should definitely be paying players more.
Maybe things will even out when they renegotiate the next collective bargaining agreement.
I hope so, the NFL owners can't complain about revenue if they are making that much money.
The definitely can't.
