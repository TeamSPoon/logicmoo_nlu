Did you ever watch The Clone Wars?
Was that the cartoon?
Yes it was
No I did not watch that
Yeah it was weird to see  the movie in cartoon shape
I dont think it mattered that much to the storyline right?
No it didnt have any bearing.
If it did I would have watched it
I think the point of the film was to appeal to a younger audience
Yeah that does not make much sense.
