Have you seen the Star Wars movies?
Did you really just ask that question?
I know it's surprising but some people have never seen any of the movies.
I feel bad for those people!
I know I can't imagine reaching adulthood never having seen Star Wars or wanting to see it.
Some people are just unlucky to not want to immediately see it.
I also can't stand the people who have only seen the new Star Wars movies and claim they're better then the old ones.
Wait, they claim the new ones are better and they have never seen the old ones?
Yes I just don't get how they can make such a bold statement.
The new Star Wars movies wouldn't even exist if the old ones weren't made first.
That is a great point. I am sure the new ones have great effects and everything but they can't beat the plots of the original movies.
Exactly better effects never equal better movies.
You are right there have been awful movies with great special effects.
To be honest I've never seen the new Star Wars movies.
Neither have I honestly.
So I guess we are just as bad as the people who have only seen the new ones yet claim they are better.
Yes we should probably watch the new Star Wars movies so we can make a better opinion.
I completely agree and we should watch them together.
Great idea let's watch them together soon.
Sounds good it was great talking about Star Wars with you!
