What kind of music do you listen to when you want to pump yourself up?
Like for exercising?
Anything, really. What makes you want to take on the day?
Bruno Mars is a definite go-to.
Yeah, 'Uptown Funk' can wake anyone up.
Going old school, I'd say Prince's 'Let's Go Crazy' is a great one.
Oh, Prince. I still can't believe he's gone.
Me neither. There's also 'Hey Ya' from Outcast.
I forgot about that song! I used to dance to it so much.
And don't forget about Beyonce.
Girl, I could NEVER forget about Beyonce.
'Crazy in Love'...'Single Ladies'...jams that definitely get the blood flowing.
Not to mention stuff from Destiny's Child. .
I used to love exercising to 'Jumpin Jumpin'.
There were a lot of Destiny's Child songs on my workout playlist. Still are, actually.
'Survivor' is a good one for getting yourself pumped up.
'I Will Survive' falls under that category too.
It's not sung by Queen Bey though.
True. But Gloria Gaynor is pretty awesome in her own right.
I'm not going to argue with that.
