Hey, do you want to see a movie this weekend?
Sure, I'd love to! What should we see?
I'm thinking something with action.
Hmm, what about Wonder Woman?
Yes! I've been dying to see it. Finally a woman headlining a movie like that!
Seriously! How many men have we seen at a center of an action movie?
Too many! Did you hear about the men who were complaining about a women-only screening?
I did see that on the news! How silly.
It would be so cool to go with all women!
Agreed! Then let's look for a women-only screening tomorrow.
I'm all in! Did you know the director is a woman, too?
I didn't know that! Who is is?
Patty Jenkins. She also directed Monster, from 2003.
The one with Charlize Theron?
That's the one! It was super creepy.
I know! Let's hope that Wonder Woman is a little different.
I think it should be a little more... inspirational.
I think so! Wait, guess what? Look what's on IMBD!
Let me see! Looks like Robin Wright is in Wonder Woman, too!
We're definitely seeing it tomorrow then, no question!
