The Cavaliers are having a cake walk into the finals
There is no team in the East who can compete with them right now
They are undefeated in the playoffs
Yeah I know they have been dominating the competition.
Just to think a lot of pundits were worried about this team before the playoffs
Yeah I know everyone was doubting them because of their regular season
Now we see how much of a joke that was
Yeah they are stomping on the competition right now
After the 1st round none of their games have been that competitive.
Lebron James is just running over people
Yeah he cannot be stopped
He's starting to remind me of Jordan
How is that?
Teams seem intimidated by him before he even steps on the court
I know it's like they are scared of him
Exactly. He has already won the mental battle before the games  begin
Yeah this Cleveland team and Lebron are rolling
I just wish they had some competitive games
Yeah me too. This has been way to easy for them
Well at least the Finals should be a lot more competitive.
