Have you seen the movies The Last Mimzy?
Yes it was great!
It really went places that I had never expected.
That's what i want in out of in a movie.
Yes it is so refreshing and exciting when it does happen.
Timothy Hutton is the only famous actor in it that I knew.
Yes  that's true but isn't great they did such a good job on the trailer that it made you want to see it.
That is true. Why is it we are always so ready to watch movies if they have one actor we know and it could be bad.
I see where you are going with this. Why is it we are not so accepting of unknowns.
Yeah think of some jewels we may have missed out on just because there wasn't a "known" actor?
Wow isn't that a good metaphor for life. Not giving someone a chance because you don't know them.
Hey  hang on I need to go check my chicken. Hah i just thought of another silly movie Ghost and Mister Chicken. Who played lead?
Okay I am back. Did you get the answer without looking it up?
I had to look it up. I remembered the name of the movie but Don Knotts was not even on my mind.
Knott on your mind!!!  Gosh I am so lame.
Yes you are. Barney from Andy Griffin is Don Knotts and he's not someone I think of as an "actor"
more of a comedian I would say trying to act.
Very slapstick kind of humor.
Yes like Gilligan and Lucy.
Yes good analogy.
