Why are DC comic films so bad?
I think thats more of an opinion than a question.
They dont do nearly as good as Marvel films.
I think its a different way they film them.
They are darker I know that
And they have more depressing story lines.
I mean look at the Batman films.
Thats exactly what i was going to.
And the Superman films.
Most of them center on how the hero doesnt love what he does.
And is all alone in their universes.
So I think that contributes to something
They should bring in Marvel directors.
Yeah but the writers are the one doing the meat of the films.
Joss Whedon directs both Marvel and DC
DC also goes to CW for their TV stuff
Marvel uses ABC and Netflix.
Right so you have more stuff going on in bigger platforms
This is interesting to talk about
Yeah well its also the real reasons why the films are the way they are
