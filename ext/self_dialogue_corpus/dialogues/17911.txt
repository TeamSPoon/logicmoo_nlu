Do you like the Stones?
What kind of question is that?  Of course I do.
Yeah, like Brown Sugar.
Great song.  I liked Sympathy for the Devil.
Oh man that was awesome.
Yeah, the lyrics were political and smart too.
They just don't do that anymore you know?
Yeah, hey what about Paint it Black.
Yes!  One of my favorites.
The definitive Vietnam song.
Yeah one of many.
I liked Wild Horses too.
Yeah great song.  Kind of a different direction.
Yeah, kind of relaxing and free sounding.
Man they were something in their prime.
I'd love to see them in concert but I'm not a millionaire.
I know what you mean.
What about I Can't Get No.
Great song.  I could listen to the Stones all day.
Yeah me too.  They just have mountains of great songs.
