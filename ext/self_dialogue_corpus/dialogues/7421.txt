Who is your favorite character in Tarzan?
Oh Jane, obviously.
Why do you like Jane so much?
I like how she finally realizes that true happiness is with Tarzan and becomes one of the apes basically.
Well wasn't Tarzan important in making her realize that?
Yeah, but Jane was the one who had to actually make the hard choice, and she did.
That's true. I really like that funny little ape who Rosie O'Donnel plays.
Yeah she's a really funny character in that movie.
How do you think they slid on those trees with their bare feet?
I have no clue! It would have hurt.
