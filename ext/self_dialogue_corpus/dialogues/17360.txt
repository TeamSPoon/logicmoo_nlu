Do you like to listen to music?
Of course I do! Don't you?
Well, yes I do. I especially like the new top 40 hits I've been hearing lately.
I like top 40 too. Especially Justin Timberlake!
He's awesome. And his music is uplifting.
Exactly my thoughts. I wish I could listen to music everywhere I go.
Yeah, that would be cool. I suppose you can though.
How could I? I work in an office with a lot of stuffy people.
I can just picture you walking around with your headphones on, jamming to top 40 hits.
That would be funny, but it would probably get me fired.
Okay, I get it. Well, music soothes the soul.
Yes it does. I think it's great therapy when I'm down.
I can see that. I suppose they should come up with such a concept.
What do you mean by that?
You know, music therapy! I wonder if that's a thing?
Well if it is, sign me up! And if it isn't, maybe you're on to something!
I guess so! I'm going to look into that.
I know I would sign up for it.
Can you imagine how much fun it would be to operate a music therapy session?
Actually, I can. I think I'm going to go do some research. Music is my life!
