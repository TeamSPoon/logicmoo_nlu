What's your favorite Disney movie?
I would have to say The Little Mermaid for a lot of reasons.
What makes it your favorite?
The storyline, the animation, the songs, Ariel's character. Everything about it was wonderful.
My favorite is Aladdin. I loved the songs in that one and the genie.
Oh Robin Williams did a great job playing the genie. Iconic character.
I think Disney did Jumanji didn't they? That's another one Robin Williams was good in.
I heard they're supposed to be coming out with another one this year.
Wow Disney is on a roll. It's been a great year for them.
I still need to see Moana though. I've been hearing it was great.
