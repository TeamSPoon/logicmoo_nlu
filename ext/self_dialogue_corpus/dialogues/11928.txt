Are you a fan of The Beatles?
Yes! I think they're an amazing band.
Cool! Do you like their earlier songs like "Help" and "I Wanna Hold Your Hand?"
Yeah, their early songs were great but I'm more a fan of their later songs. What about you?
I do like their later songs, like on their Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band album, but the early songs have a special place in my heart!
What's your favorite early song of The Beatles?
I like a lot of them, actually. Eight Days a Week, I Wanna Hold Your Hand etc...
Yeah, it's hard to pick just one since they wrote so many incredible songs.
What's your favorite from their later songs?
I love Across the Universe and Eleanor Rigby -- but like you said, it's hard to pick!
