Do you like rock music from around the world?
I'm not that familiar with bands outside of the US. Do you recommend anything?
I love rock music from Japan, there are so many great guitar players like Tak Matsumoto from B'z and Syu from Galneryus.
Wow! You sound pretty knowledgeable. What do B'z sound like?
Well, they're one of Japan's biggest rock band, they've been around since the '80s. They're kind of like a Japanese Aerosmith with more hard elements.
That sounds fun! I have heard of Babymetal, are they similar?
Not really, but Babymetal is still fun. They're almost like a typical JPop band that uses metal as the set dressing.
Interesting! I didn't know that. Haven't they been on tour in the US?
Yes, they went on tour with Rob Zombie. Actually, B'z have toured the US too.
Wow, I didn't know that. I have to look into more Japanese bands.
