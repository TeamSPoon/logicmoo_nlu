Well, sometimes in the NFL you just have to start rebuilding.
Yea, I agree, but the Seahawks are definitely not at that point yet.
Yea, I'm just trying to see that its hard to sustain winning without any period of losing.
Yea, you are right, but a few teams have done it.
Yea, well with the salary cap, it puts the pressure on making the most of your money.
Exactly, but two or three bad contracts and your team is in a bad hole.
Yea, that is why it is so important to take advantage of the draft.
Yea, teams that do that end up in bad situations from overspending in free agency.
I agree! Teams like the Redskins do that.
Yea and they haven't experienced much winning, have they?
Not at all. They sometimes have a good year or two, but never sustain anything.
I agree. Then you look at the packers who win year after year.
Yea, because they build the right way.
Yea! Have you ever seen their roster? They were almost all drafted by the team.
That is an incredible accomplishment!
Yea, not many teams can say that.
I agree! Trades and free agency fill needs. Not built teams.
Thats exactly right! The teams who realize that are most successful.
Yea, its not rocket science, but some owners and GM's just like to open up the checkbooks.
Yea, without thinking. Always a wise choice.
