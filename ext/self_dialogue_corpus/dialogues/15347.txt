Do you remember the good old days of music?
Here we go again, what good old days are you talking about?
The 90's man!  Every genre was great back then.
I kind of like the music of today better.
I can't believe you. Name one band that's better than the 90's grunge scene.
Well, I think Imagine Dragons is better.
So you're saying Imagine Dragons is better than Nirvana or Pearl Jam?
I hate Nirvana, so yeah that's what I'm saying.
How can you say the guys who sing about radioactive are better than one of the greatest rock bands of all time.
Now you're pushing it, there's no way Nirvana is one of the greatest rock bands of all time.
Really? Everyone knows Smells like teen spirit.
Yeah, but they aren't even close to being on the same level as Queen.
I'd say they're pretty close.
You've lost your mind.  Anyways beside's Nirvana, who else is better than the bands now.
Well, I already said pearl jam, but what about the Smashing Pumpkins?
The smashing pumpkins were good, too bad Billy Corgan is a crazy person now though.
Yeah, didn't he join a cult or something?
I think so.  But back to the original topic, I feel like the 70s and 80s were the good old days in music, not the 90s.
I guess I could agree with that.
Finally you're using your brain.
