Do you think Simon and garfunkel will ever tour again?
You mean together?
Yes,that's what I mean.
I hope so,but I doubt it.
They are not good friends.
Not from what I've heard.
They had some classic songs together.
Mrs robinson my favorite.
Was from the movie the graduate,right?
Yes it was.
How about bridge over troubled water.
Another classic song.
Homeward bound another good one.
I always liked the sound of silence.
Very good one.
When did they break up?
I think it was in the seventies.
Really was a shame.
I know paul Simon still writes.
Yes and plays live.
