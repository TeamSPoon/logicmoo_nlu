Do you like movies with Adam Sandler in them?
They are some of my favorites.
I think his older work was better than the newer stuff.
I would agree.
Movies like Big Daddy and Billy Madison.
Those are two of his best.
What is your favorite part of Big Daddy?
I like when they are at McDonald's too late to get breakfast.
That part is hilarious.
The kid in that movie does a great job as well.
Yes he does.
Do you know his name?
I believe it is Dylan Sprouse.
Hey, I think you are right.  What is your favorite part of the movie?
I think my favorite part is when they are throwing sticks at the roller bladers.
Another great scene.
How many times do you think you have seen that movie.
At least five or more.
I own it and I bet I have watched it twenty times.
Wow!  That is a lot.
