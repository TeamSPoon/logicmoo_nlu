There are so many good Disney animated films, but Mary Poppins is my favorite.
Oh, mine too! Julie Andrews is perfect.
So is Dick Van Dyke.
I agree. They make such a cute couple in that film.
Did you know they're making a sequel?
I had no idea!
Yes, it's called Mary Poppins Returns. I think Emily Blunt is staring in it.
Oh wow. She will be amazing, I'm sure.
Yes. But nothing can really compare to the original.
No way.
