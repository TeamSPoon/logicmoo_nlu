What did you think of Rey in the Force Awakens?
I thought she was great.  I can't wait to see her training with Luke.
Yeah, that will be cool.  Do you think she's his daughter?
Maybe, but that seems like the easy answer.
Yeah I think you're right about that.
I heard possibly her last name was Kenobi and might be his granddaughter.
That would be great as she heard his voice when she first grabbed Luke's old light saber.
Yeah, that was a crazy scene too.
Speaking of crazy, her fight against Kilo Ren was cool
Yeah, her Force powers must be off the scale to over power him like that.
