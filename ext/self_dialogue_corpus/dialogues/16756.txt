So, tell me about some of your favorite music bands.
Do you mean rock and roll bands or what?
You can name any type of bands you want, give me your top three from any genre.
I would go with Areosmith, Poison, and journey as my three favorites.
Those are some great bands that have all made wonderful music over the years.
I used to listen to one of these groups before every game of my junior and senior seasons.
Cool, so you would listen to them in order to get hyped up?
Not really hyped, they all just had songs that really got me motivated to go out and perform.
That is understandable,what are some of your favorite songs from each of them?
That is tough to narrow down, but how about I tell you my favorite song from each band?
That sounds fine, lets have them!
For Journey, it has to be Open Arms, as I could listen to that one all day!
I know what you mean, I know a couple that played that song at their wedding.
For Aerosmith, I have always loved Sweet Emotion. That song brings back a lot of memories for me.
Yea that one was really popular back in the day, nice choice!
Last but not least, I would go with Every Rose Has Its Thorn by Poison.
Those are some nice choices, all classics in my book.
Its funny how certain songs can bring you back to where you were when you first heard them.
That is strange, but very true. Music is truly magical.
Yes it is!  Music makes the world go around i my opinion!
