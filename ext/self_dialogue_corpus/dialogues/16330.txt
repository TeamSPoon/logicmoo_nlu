Have you heard any good albums lately?
Hmm, I am not sure. I think Adele's 25 is the newest album I have been listening to.
Wow, really? Didn't that come out a couple of years ago.
Yeah, but it is so good. I can't stop listening to it.
Yeah, Adele is pretty amazing. I have only heard a few songs of the new album, though.
Really? You have to listen to more of it them.
Okay, I will!
You can borrow my CD if you want.
Are you sure? You said it is all you listen to!
It's fine! I have them downloaded.
Okay, awesome. Thanks.
No problem!
Do you like the Red Hot Chili Peppers?
I haven't really listened to them much.
I like them a lot! They are probably my favorite band.
I didn't know that! I'll give them a listen.
Okay. You may not like them, though.
Why wouldn't I?
They are just kind of particular. Pretty funky.
Well I will give them a try anyways!
