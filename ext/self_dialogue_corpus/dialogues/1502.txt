Teams report for camp soon.  who is your pick for Super Bowl Champs?
I like the Cowboys.  Their two star rookies from last year, Dak Prescott and Zeke Elliott, should be better.  And , oh that offensive line.
They should do well.  I like Green Bay.
Everybody does at the beginning of the season.  I have to wonder if it's just Aaron Rodgers and 21 other guys.
Tom Brady is getting a little long in the tooth.
Yrs, but he's also quarterback of the defending Super Bowl Champs.
What about the LA Rams?
It all revolves around Goff and Todd Gurley.  If they produce, the Rams could make some noise.
I doubt that.  What is with the Raiders?  Las Vegas?  Really?
The NFL doesn't like gambling, but they move to Vegas.  Makes you wonder.
Yes, it does.
It's putting the wolf in charge of the henhouse.
The Falcons laid an egg in the second half of the Super Bowl last year.
It was hard to watch.  They could do nothing right and the Pats could follow no wrong.
It will be interesting to see how they overcome that this year.
They should do all right.  The NFC South is one of the weaker divisions.
Is the NFL all right?  Viewership was way down last year.
Nothing goes up forever.  Maybe this is the tipping point for them.
Hopefully view ship will come back.  A good season for most of the teams will help.
Cowboys baby.  They're Americas team.
