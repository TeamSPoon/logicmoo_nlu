You know how they made a live action version of Beauty and the Beast?
Yeah, what about it?
Well, I was thinking that since they've already made a live adaption for Cinderella as well, why not also make one for Mulan?
Oh, I would love to see that.
This would be a great opportunity to cast some lesser known but equally talented Asian actors and actresses.
Do you think that all of the casting members should be able to sing? I mean, the live version could turn into another musical.
Honestly, I'd prefer it if the producers could change up the story a bit and add a some twist to it. Like they could focus more on recreating the characters and story instead of trying to replicate the Disney version.
I can see that. People might compare it to the original.
It's not just that. If people wanted to see an exact replica of it, they'd go see the Disney version.
True.
