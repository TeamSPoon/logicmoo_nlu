Do you remember Our Lady Peace?
The band?  I wonder what happened to them?
I don't know, but I've been listening to their old stuff.
Yeah, they had a lot of good music.
What was your favorite song by them?
I really liked Somewhere Out There.
Oh, yeah.  I really liked that one too.
I liked it more than Superman's Dead and the others.
Yeah, I wish they'd put out some more music.
They were really good to listen too.
