What do you think is the best Disney song?
'I'll Make a Man out of You,' from Mulan.  Musically, it is the best written song.
That's a great choice.  Mulan was also my favorite movie overall.
Likewise.  It was empowering to women, and also the first Disney movie with such a big Asian cast.
Now that you mention it, Disney really didn't have that much Asian representation.  I hope they do so more.
I hope so too.  Representation matters, and I'm glad Disney is at least making an effort.
Who was your favorite character?
Mooshoo was so funny to me as a kid.
As an adult, I still find him funny.
Eddie Murphy was the perfect person to voice Mooshoo.
