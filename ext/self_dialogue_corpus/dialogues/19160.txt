What do you think of Yoko Ono, the musician that supposedly broke up the Beatles?
I did not care for her, I thought her music was horrible.
Me too, it was a really bizare type of rock and roll.
It was , did not even sound like music to me at all.
SHe had a really interesting life though.
Really?
Yes she was born to very wealthy parents in Tokyo, Japan but after the was they fell onto harder times.
And then what?
At one point she was suicidal and committed to a mental institution.
What were some of her songs?
She had many , remember her band The Plastic Ono Band?
Oh I forgot all about that band.
Plus she wrote a ton of music.
And managed John Lennons careeer .
Yes I do not think that was a good thing though
Me either.
She is still doing art and music today although she is not out in front of the public much at all.
Well she is pretty much a loner.
She is also 84.
Wow really? I always still think of her as pretty young.
