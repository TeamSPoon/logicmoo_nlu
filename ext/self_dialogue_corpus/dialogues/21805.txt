Have you seen The Proposal?
Maybe, who is in that one?
The main characters are Ryan Reynolds and Sandra Bullock.
No, I haven't seen that one. Can you tell me more about it?
Well Ryan Reynolds work for Sandra Bullock who is going to be deported. She kind of forces him to marry her so she can stay in the country.
Sounds like it has a good plot. Any other characters I would know?
I can't believe I forgot this, Betty White plays Ryan Reynolds grandma.
Oh I bet that is hillarious!
I honestly cannot think of a time that Betty White was not hillarious, but she is so so funny in this.
It sounds like a movie I may life. I doubt my husband would though.
There is actually a lot of non-romantic comedy in it. He may like it.
Does your husband like it?
Oh he loves it. He usually likes movies more along the lines of Gladiator.
Gladiator, with Russel Crow?
That's the one. It is a few years old now, but still a very good movie.
It is. My husband also likes Braveheart.
Mel Gibson is so good in Braveheart. Have you heard much about his work recently?
I haven't heard too much. I think he has had some movies, but nothing iconic like Lethal Weapon or Braveheart.
I really liked him in The Patriot and We Were Soldier as well.
Those are both great movies.
