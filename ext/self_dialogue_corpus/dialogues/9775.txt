I used to get upset with the new hip hop, but then I just decided to spend my time and energy revisiting the older music I prefer
What bothers you about new hip hop?
It doesn't sound good.
Like the beats aren't as good or the lyrics aren't as good?
Both aren't as good to me
Do you think it has to do with over-production or under-production?
It just doesn't sound like the boom bap anymore.  It's just all electronic now
But isn't boom bap generated all electronically as well?
Yeah, but they sampled records, and now it's all sounds from the computer; beeps and lasers.
I don't even listen to hipk hop anymore.
