Any good kids movies coming out this summer?
There is a “Capitan Underpants” one, if your kids like this kind of humor.
That is for elementary and middle school kids I assume since the books are. Is it a cartoon?
Yes.  Do you care if they are cartoons or not?
It doesn’t matter either way as long as they are child friendly.
Well, “Despicable Me 3” and “Cars 3” are both cartoons, and for kids.
What about ones that aren’t cartoons?
There is a Whimpy Kid movie that is still for the younger crowd, but not a cartoon.
What about movies for older kids?
“Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2” and “King Arthur” are out already, and are probably good for teens but not little kids.
They don’t need to be G rated or anything.
There is a new Pirates, with Depp of course, out now. Also, Wonder Woman.
It is so expensive though to take kids to the movies, I want to make sure they really want to go and will enjoy it.
Some of the major movie chains offer really cheap movies during the summer, on weekday mornings I think.
Are they new ones, or at least reasonably new?
I know Regal has some including “Kung Fu Panda 3” and “Trolls”
Those aren’t too old.
There is also “The Lego Batman Movie” and “Sing” so they seem like they are within the last couple years. The all seem good for elementary aged kids.
How much are the movies at Regal?
I think it is only a dollar.
