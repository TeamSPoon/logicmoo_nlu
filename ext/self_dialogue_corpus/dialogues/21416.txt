I am really starting to like the children animation movies that I watch with my daughter.
Yes, those movies are great.
They are so addictive
Yes, since my children watch them I've grown to like them as well.
I really like Despicable Me 3.
Me too, after watching the first two I had to watch that one.
This movie has a lot of action in it.
I liked it because of the comedy in it.
Do you have any other movies like that which are funny?
Yes, I have a few.
Which one in particular do you like?
I really like Cars 3.
Oh yea, that movie was amazing as well.
It is weird that even as an adult I really like those movies.
Yes, the movies are marketed towards kids, but they are great.
I agree, those movies are now for everyone and not just kids
I liked Cars 2 better than Cars 3
Why is that?
I just think Cars 2 was a better overall movie and it was more authentic.
I think I feel the same way about that movie as well.
