Are you hoping to see some quality football this year?
I most certainly am.  Football season is about the only time I watch television anymore.
Are you rooting for any specific teams?
Of course, but mostly I just want to enjoy some great competition.
Don't leave me hanging, which team?
I like the Seahawks, but I won't be disappointed if a number of teams are successful this year.
So you're more of a fan of the sport than a specific team?
Sure.  I really like physical competition and the nature of football creates a lot of physical engagement, suspense, drama, and glory.
So what do you like about the Seahawks then?
I like their style of play.
You mean running the football?
Yes, I think running the football is one of the most effective strategies when combined with a strong defense.
And having that amazing stadium certainly helps that defense.
It does and it's also an amazing experience to be in that stadium when it's loud.
I know.  I've been to one of their games and even though it was preseason I was thoroughly impressed by the atmosphere.
Seattle really is a football city.
That's probably why their attempts to bring back a basketball team have failed.
It doesn't help when those teams have historically under performed.
Hopefully Seattle will have a good, injury free season.
And some better offensive linemen.
