So, I checked out the postmodern Jukebox like you told me to.
Yeah? What do you think?
They're from New York, huh?
Yep. The head arranger guy, Scott Bradlee was a jazz musician there.
Their whole Broadway vibe is unmistakable.
Yep, and to have that many singers and musicians with exactly same skill sets, it can only be done in New York
Exactly. They're all probably Broadway or off-Broadway performers.
Super talented, well educated. That blonde singer went to Julliard and studied Opera
Morgan James. I love her.
Yep.
Maybe she couldn't hack it as an Opera singer. That's some hard work...
Maybe, but she's great at Jazz, so why not do it?
Her body language is so poised and so well rehearsed. I always wondered if she had a formal education...
My honest guess is that most of them have bachelor's in music from some college somewhere.
Why do you say that?
Just the sheer command of the instruments. Not just being able to play some tunes, but many with varying styles is not something you can just pick up and learn.
Fair enough.
They're touring. I'm definitely going to see them live.
Me too. We should make it a date
Oh, so we're dating now?
