Do you like Linkin Park?
I don't think I have heard of them.
They are a kind of cross between rap and techno music.
That sounds like something I would like, maybe I have heard of them.
They did a mash up song with Jay-Z a while back with Numb and Encore.
I think I did hear that at least once. Name another song.
There are so many. Breaking the Habit is another one of my favorites.
I have not heard of that one.
You should listen to them. You have to really listen to the lyrics.
Okay, is there a specific album you suggest?
Start with Hybrid Theory.  They got a little too political for me after that.
I am searching Spotify for it right now.
If you need to, look up the lyrics and read them while you listen.
Really? Is it that important to know the words?
Yes, those lyrics got me through some of the worst times in my life.
I love music that speaks to you like that.
Me too.  I can't tell you how much strength I got from In the End several years ago.
Now, I am really curious. I am going to go listen to it right now.
Ok, let me know what you think.
You got it.
