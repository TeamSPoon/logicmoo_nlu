Have you ever seen Forrest Gump?
Yeah, I caught it when it first came out.
I watch it every time it's on tv.
Oh yeah, you like it that much eh?
Yeah, I must have seen it 50 times by now.
I just remember him being told to run everywhere.
Haha, yeah, after he gets his leg braces off he can run like the wind.
Of course everyone knows about the box of chocolates line.
I think you should watch it again if you haven't seen it in that long.
Yeah, I do like movies that incorporate historical events.
This movie it full of little moments like that, even stuff you forget about.
Oh yeah, like what?
Just stuff like attempted assassinations.  I can remember exactly where I was when that happened.
Yeah, that kind of stuff seemed to happen a lot more back then.
A lot of people forget some of the supporting cast too.
Like who?
The biggest one for me is Gary Senise, he wasn't hugely popular back then, but is almost a household name now.
Yeah, I loved him in The Green Mile
He tends to show up in a lot of Hanks movies
They must be pretty good friends.
