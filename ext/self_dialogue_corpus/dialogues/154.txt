Do you think Captain America: Civil War succeeded as a Captain America movie?
Well, yeah, he's the main character.
I mean, instead of it being an Avengers-focused movie.
Oh, got you. Umm, yes, I think so.
Why?
It was mostly about him, his beliefs and how they jarred against Tony's, and how this broke up the team.
What about Bucky?
I'm not sure that matters. Yes, it is part of his character and his morals, but the Bucky thing doesn't work for me.
The "Bucky thing?"
His memory was wiped yet he's always on Cap's side. Doesn't seem like it would actually happen.
