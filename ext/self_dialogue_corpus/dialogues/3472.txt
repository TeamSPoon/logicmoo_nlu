Have you seen any good horror movies lately?
No, not lately.  But I've been meaning to see the new Alien movie.
Oh yeah, I'm a little worried that they're going to mess up the franchise.
I think they're going to do a good job.  But I'm just holding out until It comes out later this year.
Oh yeah, It is going to be terrifying.  Do you think Skaarsgard is going to do a good job?
Well, it will be hard to compete with Tim Curry, the original It.  But from the trailers, it looks really scary.
It definitely does. I'm glad they're remaking it.  I think it needed an update.
Well, the original was awesome.  But I'm curious to see if they might be more true to the book in this movie.
Yeah, in the book It was rarely a clown, he usually took the form of some horrible creature.  So I really hope they work with that.
Me too.
