Have you ever seen the Wizard of Oz?
Yeah, but not in a long time.
That movie is really weird.
Some of it use to scare me as a kid.
Did you ever see the guy hanging in the trees during the scene in the forest?
Yeah, but they say it was just a bag of sand or something else hanging from a rope.
Well, did you know Toto the dog was paid more than the munchkin actors?
What, that's insulting to those actors.
Do you know what dance they do in the movie?
No, I know the scene, but what is the dance?
It's the 1939 latest dance craze, the jitterbug.
Man, that movie is old.
I'm glad they haven't tried to do a complete remake of it.
Oh, you know they will eventually.
There are just some movies that don't need remakes.
I agree with that.
They should just leave the Wizard of Oz alone.
You know someone in Hollywood is pitching or has pitched remaking that movie.
I really wish they would make new movies instead or remaking movies.
It almost seems like Hollywood has run out of ideas.
