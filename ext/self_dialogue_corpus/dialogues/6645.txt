I can't wait for Cars 3 to come out.
I know, I loved the first two.
We should go, it comes out on June 16th.
For sure we will.  Who does the voices in it.
Owen Wilson is Lightning McQueen.
Oh that's right.
And Paul Newman was in it before he died.
Who did he play?
Doc Hudson.
Awesome.  I can't wait to go.
