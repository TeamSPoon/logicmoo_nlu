Hey, are you an Ed Sheeran fan?
Yea definitely, I love that song, shape of you.
Yea that's a pretty good one, but have you heard castle on the hill?
I listen to Castle on the Hill all the time! That song is so good.
What about the slower songs, like Thinking out Loud?
Yea I really like Thinking out Loud. I liked it so much I  learned to play it on my guitar.
Whoa that's cool! I really like his song because the lyrics generally have a lot of meaning.
Yea, Castle on the Hill reminded me of my childhood.
Exactly. Photograph gives me a lot of nostalgia.
Same here, Ed Sheeran is great.
