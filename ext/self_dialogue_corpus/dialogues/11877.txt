Are you a big fan of the Beatles?
Yes and no. I like some stuff.
What is your favorite song?
My favorite sounds silly but is Yellow Submarine.
That is a unique choice.
I just like that it's different and make me happy at at the same time.
Did you know they were only together for less than 10 years.
They sure do have a lot of songs packed into those years.
Do you like any of their solo careers?
I definitely like a lot of Paul McCartney's solo stuff.
