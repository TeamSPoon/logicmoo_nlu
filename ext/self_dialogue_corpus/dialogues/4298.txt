I just finished watching the movie Split.
Oh my god that is one of my favorite movies to come out in 2016.
I know, James McAvoy nailed the role down perfectly.
Which was hard to do considering he had about 23 different personalities.
They way he slipped in and out of character was super creepy.
Yeah especially when he became the young boy.
Did you catch the surprise ending?
Seeing Bruce Willis as David Dunn literally blew my mind.
I felt the same way, it made me reevaluate and look at the movie from a whole other perspective.
I guess this means we will be seeing a Unbreakable 2 movie in the future.
