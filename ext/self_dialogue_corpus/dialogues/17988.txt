Some artists really last for a long time, longer than you'd expect them to stay popular.
Like who do you mean?
Well it happens a lot but I'm not thinking about people who stay popular because they died when they were. I'm thinking about people like Elton John.
I'm not sure I'd describe Elton John as popular.
Are you kidding? His music is everywhere!
Come on, everywhere?
He's on the radio with his older rock stuff, he's in movies, commercials, tv shows, broadway. He's everywhere!
But isn't that because he changed genres? Rocket Man is a far cry from The Lion King.
I think that's my point though.
What is?
That sometimes someone can be really good but they fade out really fast because they can't or won't do what he does.
You mean selling out and working for Disney?
The basic thing of what he does is being a great singer and piano player, right?
I can go with that.
Why is doing that as a rock star better than writing songs that Disney puts in a movie and everyone knows?
Because rock and roll is about freedom and Disney is about money and princesses!
I just don't think you can call someone a sell out for finding ways to keep their music relevant. People move on and grow and change.
All the way to the bank.
Yeah but I bet you know those Lion King songs, and he's still got a career long after most of his contemporaries are in quiet retirement.
Ok, you made your point.
