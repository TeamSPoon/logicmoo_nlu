Have you ever heard of a thriller staring Andy Griffith?
I think so.
What was the name of it?
Grampa? No, it was Gramps.  John Ritter was in it too,
And Griffith was playing a sociopath?
Yeah. It was a pretty decent movie as I recall.
Oh wow. My dad told me about it, but I couldn't believe him.
Why not?
I never would have expected Andy Griffith playing a crazy old man
The movie was made around 1995. You should check it out.
