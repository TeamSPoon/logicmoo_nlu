Do you think Jurassic Park was a horror film?
Hmmm, maybe. Maybe it was more of a thriller movie.
Nah, I think it is a horror movie
How so?
Has all the elements, monsters, scary moments, violence
Yeah, I guess you're right
Plus there are some jump out of your seat moments
Right, with the raptors in the kitchen
And the t-rex picking up the cars in the rain.
Oh right...classic scene.
