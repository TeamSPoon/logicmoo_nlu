Have you ever heard of Devin Townsend?
No, I haven't. Who's he?
He used to be in some really heavy metal band called Strapping Young Lad, but most of his work is his solo stuff and it's so varied.
I'm not too into metal, but what's his other stuff like?
Yeah, I'm not into his heavy stuff, but he's got a new age album, lighter rock, an album he calls "haunted Johnny Cash songs", progressive; basically anything you could imagine.
He does sound quite interesting. "Haunted Johnny Cash songs?"
That's one of my favorites. It's quite mellow and ambient at times, which he's also known to do.
Where's he from?
Canada. Western Canada, I believe.
Have you ever seen him live?
Not yet, but I'd like to. However, he mostly focuses on his more aggressive stuff at live shows, even though he has played a number of shows for his more mellow repertoire.
Does he play any instruments or does he just sing?
He usually plays guitar along with his singing, but he's said he'd like to focus on bass sometime.
How's his voice?
Really good. His clean singing sounds awesome, and he also does a bunch of screaming in his metal stuff, but the clean singing is what I like most.
How old is he?
In his mid-40s, I believe. He started out young as a singer with Steve Vai, with most of his solo stuff coming to fruition in the late 90s.
It sounds pretty cool. What's his new age album called?
You'll want to listen to Ghost. He's never sounded more new-agey than on Ghost.
It reminds me of Kip Winger a little. Kip Winger was a metal guy and made a new-agey album.
