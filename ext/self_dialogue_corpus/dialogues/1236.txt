Which sport do you think is the most popular in America?
That would be the NFL!
You are correct, and it really is not even close.
I can see why, football is simply in our blood as Americans.
It sure is; most people probably wish the season could go all year long!
As a huge NFL fan, I can certainly tell you that having the NFL all year would be awesome!
Who is your favorite player in the league if you had to choose?
I personally love watching Odell Beckham Jr. the most.
Yea he is very talented to say the least.
I am not sure if I enjoy his talent more, or his antics the most.
It seems that most really good receivers have a lot of antics to go along with their game.
What about you? Who is your favorite player to watch?
That is a really tough question for me! I may have to say Ezekiel Elliot.
He has turned out to be a really solid player for Dallas.
Yea, coming out of Ohio State I had my doubts about him. He has sure proved me wrong!
What a great combination of players for the Cowboys to build around for the future.
Are you referring to Elliot and Dak Prescott?
Yes, they have both been outstanding so far in their short careers.
They sure have! Cowboy fans have great reasons to be excited for the future.
No doubt about that! I can not wait two follow those two guys' career!
