What do you think of the Packers secondary?
Well, its weird. I think they have good players and talent, but they dont seem to produce.
Do you think that's Dom Capers fault?
I dont know. But when you look at the roster, they should be better. Haha Clinton Dix and Burnett are solid safeties. And Demarious Randall has talent.
Yeah but in today's NFL, corners are sooo important.
Yeah, and I think the Sam Shields injury really hurt the Packers secondary last year.
Yeah you may have a point there. In the playoff game they had Gunter covering Julio Jones.
Exactly. You can't expect much success in that situation.
And Gunter was probably the best corner on the Packers last year. But on most teams, and in the Packers ideal world, he would be a nickel back.
Yup. I think that shows how damaging the injury bug is.
In today's NFL secondary. Depth is key.
For sure, these days you need three or four good corners to cover whatever the NFL throws at you.
Yeah the base defense has become the nickel. You need three corners on the field all day, and if you have injury problems, pretty soon you're going to have some bad players out there.
I think this is precisely what happened to the Packers defense last year.
Well, they did add a few corners in the draft I believe.
Yeah they took Washington's Kevin King early in the second round.
Yeah, I'm excited to see him play. He looks very talented.
Yeah, scouts said he was a first round talent.
I read he has freakish athletic ability, is that true?
I haven't seen him play before but I heard his arms are crazy long.
