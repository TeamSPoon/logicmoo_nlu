What do you think of The Little Mermaid, now that you've read the original?
I'm surprised they made it so happy! The original story is so sad.
Yeah, but Disney has a magic way of making things feel better.
I know what you mean. Snow White could also be a lot worse.
Right. But they both got happier endings than the original.
Fairy tales can be intense sometimes.
Are there any others that are based on fairy tales?
I think Aladdin is?
That makes sense! It totally has that feeling.
I wonder if the original is also sad?
