So time is getting close....... bout a month away till Pre-Season
Yes, i was just thinking that.
So for the opening, who's house do you want to watch it at?
Well since it IS Tampa VS Miami, it should be my house.
I had a feeling you'd say that.
Well, Pappy is stupid for Miami so he wont leave the house on opening day.
True. We arent gonna do steaks are we?
Probably not, it's a 1 o'clock game.
That's right, i forgot.
Tam will probably make Nachos, and we'll get chips and snacks.
Will there be any 4;15 games this year?
Well, on October 1st theres one.
Very cool.
Then 4 days later they play the Patriots for a night game. Prolly too late for steaks.
Ugh.
On the 15th they play Arizona at 4:15, that woud be a good game for steaks.
Right on! i'll even host that one!
Thry only play the Falcons at 8:15 like 2 months later, all other games are at 1PM
Well, at least there will be a couple of games we can grill out.
We can always do hot dogs and burgers for a game too ya know.
