I'm dying for the new Azealia Banks record to finally come out.
Do you think it'll be out anytime soon?
Well she keeps talking about it, but I'm not sure.
You know, she's missed more than one release date.
Exactly. I need somebody to distract me.
Well have you checked out Cakes da Killa?
Can't say that I have.
He's really good. You can get his three mixtapes for free, and he just dropped an album.
I'll check it out. I've been listening to a lot of Angel Haze to bide my time.
She's another really good one.
