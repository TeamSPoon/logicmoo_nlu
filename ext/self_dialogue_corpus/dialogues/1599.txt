Do you like the Arizona Cardinals this season?
Maybe, but probably not.
Haha, what do you mean?
Well they have a good team, but they always seem to fail in the playoffs.
Yes that usually happens, but I think David Johnson is a great running back.
Yeah, he's good, and I like him in fantasy football.
Do you like Carson Palmer at quarterback?
No, not particularly.
He's very solid. Why don't you like him?
I think he plays great in the regular season, but he folds in the playoffs.
That has been his weakness.
He's just not a clutch quarterback.
What do you think about their coaching staff?
That's their strength I believe.
I love Bruce Arians as a head coach.
Yes, he really is the mastermind behind that franchise.
The Cardinals were never that good until he got there.
It was a great hire, and I think he is the main reason for their success in recent years.
When I was a kid in the 1990's, that Cardinals franchise was terrible.
I remember that they were always in the basement of their division.
