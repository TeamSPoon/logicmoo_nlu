Do you like Star Wars Movies?
Yes I do.
What is your favorite character?
I like Han Solo because he is very slick.
He brings comedic relief to the series I think.
He definitely does.
Princess Leia is one of my favorites because she is such a strong woman.
What about Luke?
Luke is sweet but is kind of a weak character in a way.
I agree with you.
