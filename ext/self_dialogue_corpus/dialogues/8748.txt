What do you think of rock music?
I really love it, I just wish more people I knew were into it.
What bands do you like listening to?
I really like the rock music of the early 80s. Iron Maiden, Def Leppard, there were a lot of good British bands.
Yeah, shame Def Leppard got lumped into the hair metal genre.
Not really, hair metal was fun to listen to. They dressed weird, of course, but they had some pretty heavy rock music.
I honestly did like Motley Crue, they were a guilty pleasure.
Girls, Girls, Girls was great, but power ballads like Home Sweet Home and Without You really hit close to home.
Power Ballads, yeah, you hear of Tesla, they had a good one.
Love Song? Indeed, I really liked that one!
