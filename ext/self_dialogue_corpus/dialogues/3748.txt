So do you have a favorite genre in movies?
I love watching a good thriller.
Me to, have you ever seen Trespass?
I think so, who does it have in it?
It stars Nicolas Cage and Nicole Kidman.
I have not seen that actually. What is it about?
Cage and Kidman play a rich couple that get harassed by a group of thugs.
That sounds like it could be interesting.
You will have to watch it sometime and let me know what you think.
I will do that for sure. Thanks for suggesting it!
