Who is your favorite director?
I'd have to go with Steven Spielberg.
Yeah, he's pretty good.
Pretty good?! I think you need your head examined.
Tim Burton is mine.
Tim Burton?
Yeah, he makes all those weird movies.
Weird is good?
Edward Scissor Hands.
OK.
Betelguise.
Sure.
Alice in Wonderland.
OK. He's good, but no Spielberg.
No, he's not. That's why I like him.
Spielberg a little too mainstream for your liking.
I like him just fine. Just not my favorite.
To each his own.
I think his best work was probably Goonies.
You would like that one!
