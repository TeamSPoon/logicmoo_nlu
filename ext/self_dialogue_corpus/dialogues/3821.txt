what do you consider the best thriller of all time?
I think it would be hard to pick one.
Ok, what do you say is the best one in the last decade?
I would have to go with Gone Girl.
Remind me, who was in that one?
It had Ben Afleck.
Right, with the wife who might not be dead?
Yes, it keeps you guessing until the final shot.
I love those action packed thrillers.
But ones that also have a lot of psychological thrill too.
