I don't listen to a lot of rock music, can you tell me some good songs to check out?
Well, one of my all time favorite rock bands is Journey. Have you heard of them?
Yes, weren't they popular in the 80's and 90's?
Yep, They even toured more recently, but with a new lead singer. He's really good though!
So what songs should I start with to hear their best music?
The song called Don't Stop Believing is one of my favorites. It's a classic rock song from the 80's.
Who was the lead singer for them in the 80's?
His name is Steve Perry and he has an amazing voice. He went solo for awhile too.
What else should I check out from Journey?
That album with the song I mentioned is called Escape. It has some great songs and it would be a great album to start with!
