You know which Hitchcock movie I love is North by Northwest.
That's a great one Cary Grant is in that one right?
Yes and they mistake him for someone else and he has to run.
Yes that one has some great locations like when he is on Mount Rushmore.
Yes that is a great scene.
I always liked Strangers on a Train
Oh ya that's a good one too with Robert Walker.
Yes where they each have someone they want murdered so they agree to murder the others person.
Yes only one of them changers there mind.
Yes I think there have been a few movies that have used that idea for their movie.
