You know what totally trips me out?
What?
That I really can't stand Neil Diamond, but he wrote some of the Monkee's best songs!
I totoally agree!  I really like his songs, but his performance style is too bombastic for me.
Bombastic is perfect!  But holy cow -- songs like "I'm a Believer" and "Here Comes Tomorrow" are just incredible!
I know! I love "Here Comes Tomorrow." It's one of my favorite songs of all time.
Yeah, when I was first introduced to the Monkees, I couldn't understand all the lyrics because of Davy's accent -- "Bode-eye" and such!
I totally agree! I had to ask someone who said it was "But I" -- that kills me.
I love that song. I love the Lovin' Spoonfull's "Did you Ever Have to Make Up Your Mind," which is  kind of on the same theme.
Oh, yeah, that song is fabulous.  I really like Lovin' Spoonful.
So do I. I love Jug Band Music!
Me, too!  I really like how happy so much of their songs are.
You know what song I used to hate and really like now?
What?
That one "If  you're going to San Fran Cisco, be sure to wear some flowers in your hair.."
That song is too corny!
I used to think so, too, but I've watched Monterey Pop so many times now, I love it!
That cracks me up -- that's happened to me before.
Yeah, that happened to me with the Bay City Rollers when I was little -- I didn't like them, but my neice played them all the time, and I ended up loving them.
Worn down, eh! That's funny!!
