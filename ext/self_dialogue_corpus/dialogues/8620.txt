Who was the band that covered the Michael Jackson song "Smooth Criminal?"
You are thinking of Alien Ant Farm
Have you heard of them recently?
No I havent heard from them since that song
Well they did have that other song Movies
OK so they had two hits off the same record
Yeah I guess that would qualify them as duds.
Yes they werent that great to begin with
So making a cover as your first song is probably the wrong way to go
Its the easy way to go but if you arent good you will sink quickly.
