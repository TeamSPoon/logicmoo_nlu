Are you excited for the upcoming NFL season?
Like you wouldn't believe.
I know.  I really enjoy watching games.
It is nice they are on so many days now.
I know.
It seems not long ago it was just Sunday and Monday.
It was.
Now they have Thursday and sometimes even Saturday.
Not to mention the games overseas.
That is right.
Then you have Sunday morning football.
I think it is a good thing.
I do to.
Some people complain about the schedule.
I know.  I don't understand that.
I don't either.
I really enjoy watching Thursday football.
Why is that?
Because I work Monday through Thursday so it is my first night off.
That must be nice.
