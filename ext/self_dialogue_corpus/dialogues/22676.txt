I watched a really funny older movie the other day.
What movie was that?
It was an old Lucy and Desi movie called The Long, Long Trailer.
Were they being Lucy and Ricky, or completely different parts?
They were completely different characters.
What is the plot about?
They are getting married and he travels a lot for work. So, they decide to invest in a trailer home so she can go with him and they are always home.
Sounds unique. Is it a comedy?
Oh, you bet! It's just one of those "nothing ever works out" movies.
Sounds funny, maybe I will have to check it out.
What about you, seen any good movies lately?
I watched Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them the other day. It was pretty good.
I have been meaning to watch that. I love the Harry Potter series so I am sure I would like it.
They do not really have anything to do with the other. Of course, other than the fact that they both take place in the magical world.
Where does this one take place?
It takes place in America. An Englishman has come to America and all kinds of hillarious things happen.
Sounds good. I have been meaning to watch it.
Just to warn you, it is a little slow to get going.
So which is better Harry Potter or Fantastic Beasts?
Oh hands down, Harry Potter! But Fantastic Beasts is still very good.
