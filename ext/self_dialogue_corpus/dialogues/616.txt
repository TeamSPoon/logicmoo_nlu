Why is football so popular in the US?
I think because it unites towns.
It gives kids a chance to shine.
It is very important to some towns.
It was really important to my home town.
Friday nights were highlighted by football each fall.
I can remember that too in my town.
Each week we knew what we were doing on Fridays.
I remember that as well, drinking hot cocoa and cheering on the team.
The football team were like movie stars in my town.
Yeah, they were treated like that.
They were even on television each week.
Really?
We had a tv station at our school and they taped each game for many years.
They must have gotten good studying the plays.
Yes, they would take time in school to view the videos and learn from them.
It sound like football really was a big deal there.
They were.
Wow, did they get recruited to college teams?
Yes, a lot did.
