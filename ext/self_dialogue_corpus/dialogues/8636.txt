So what are you listening to these days?
Music from the 1990's which was my younger days.
Why is that?
We have lost a lot of talent from the 90's and I'm just missing them.
Like who?
Well the world just lost Chris Cornell.  He was lead singer for Soundgarden and Audioslave.
Oh ok! I remember that weird video for Black Hole Sun.
It was a bit odd but it is an awesome song. Have you listened to any other music of theirs?
No, do you recommend anything?
Yes, buy Soundgarden's cds "Badmotorfinger", "Superunknown", and "Down On The Upside".  You will hear some awesome music!
