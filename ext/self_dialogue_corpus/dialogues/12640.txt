Who do you think is the better villian, Darth Vader or Kylo Ren?
Darth Vader, obivously.
Why do you say that?
Becuase he is a tormented figure, and he had his reason's for going bad.
True, but what about Kylo Ren?
Please, he's second rate by comparsion.
How do you figure.
All he has is a warped idolation for Darth and a total failure to learn from his example.
Which was what?
Don't turn to the Dark SIde, it will cost everything you love and destroy you in the end.
