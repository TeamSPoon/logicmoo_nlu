You know, the Fast & Furious films have really come a long way.
I'm not too familiar with those movies, I'm afraid. Help me out.
I got you. So, to keep it short, it basically went from simple street racing to becoming global vehicle warfare.
That sounds insane.
And it's just as insane as it sounds.
I imagine it's been quite the journey for you.
It has. I just can't wait for what's in store.
I might have to binge watch those movies just to see for myself.
I have the entire collection on Blu-ray. I can lend them to you if you want.
That sounds like a good idea.
