What was the last concert you went to?
Drop Kick Murphies.
How were they?
Beyond awesome.  Those guys put on a show like no other.
Yeah I've heard that.
The only thing is they play with smaller bands to try and give them a chance.
Yeah, and how does that work out?
The other ones weren't that good.
That's too bad.
But they make up for it themselves.  I mean they were up in the crowd and everything.
Wow that's awesome.
Oh, and we had floor seats.
Oh jeez you're lucky.
I know.  It was a great day.
Where was it?
Boston University.
That's a good sized place.
They also said they prefer smaller joints but they had this place rocking.
Yeah sounds like it.
I highly recommend them.
