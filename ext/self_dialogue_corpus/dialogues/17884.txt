Do you know anything about Bach?
Yeah, I actually know a bunch about him. Why?
I have to do a project on him.
I would love to help you. What do you need to know?
What year was he born?
1685.
What country was he from?
Germany.
What was his most famous song?
That's a bit subjective but I would have to say "Conciertos de Brandenburgo."
I've never even heard of that.
I'm sure you would recognize it if you heard the tune of it.
Probably. I find that happens a lot to me with classical music.
I'm sure you would recognize at least some of his work. So many future songs were based off of them.
How do you know so much about Bach?
I play the piano and I've played a few of his pieces. I like to research the composers before I play the tunes so I can really play it from inside their head.
That's a really cool idea. Do a lot of people do that?
Mainly only serious musicians.
Do you really think it helps?
Oh, most definitely!
