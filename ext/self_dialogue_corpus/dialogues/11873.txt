Have you listened to a lot of the Beatles?
Actually, I guess I'm weird.  I never really saw the big deal with them.
I guess I feel the same way.
I do like some of their songs, but not any more than I like other group's songs.
So what songs do you like?
I guess my favorite would be "Jude".
Isn't that the one that they thought was written about drugs?
I've heard that.  I don't know.   I just like it because I think it sounds good.
I like it too.  I don't know of any other ones of theirs that I think too much about.
I know they did a lot of songs, but I feel that same way.
