O.K. for our lunch movie discussion today we're supposed to talk about a recent movie.
Right, I know you want to get off all the older movies we've been talking about, but the only movie I could come up with is The Circle.
Well, neither one of us has seen it.
But that's what I want to talk about it--why haven't we seen it?
I guess because it got lousy reviews.
So, we don't judge on our own.
Hey, you have to take advice--are you going to go to every movie out there.
Well, you have a point.  But Tom Hanks, Emma Watson--how can you go wrong.
Apparently they did.
Well, it based on a good book isn't it--what went wrong?
I don't know; there are some interesting issues about technology and privacy--I guess they didn't do it well--I don't know; I didn't see it.
Yeah, o.k., once something's reviewed badly, I guess you don't study why.
Anyway, if you want to see something that is rated poorly, wait for television, then you don't have to pay ten bucks a head and you can turn it off.
I did see that it was Bill Paxton's last film before his death, and I enjoyed him in Independence Day.
I think that was Bill Pullman.
Oh, then who's Bill Paxton.
I hate to admit it, but although the name is very familiar I can't place him or what he's been in.
It's funny in our society--an average entertainer gets recognized, although not by us in this case, but an extraordinary college professor, probably not.
Not unless there in the movies.  Anyway, let's forget about The Circle and next week talk about good Tom Hanks films.
Sounds good.
