What artist are you surprised you like?
For me it is taylor swift.
She is so popular why is that surprising?
Well her older stuff was more country. I only became a fan after she released 1989.
That is a great album. True a more pop swift is now present.
I liked shake it off first,  then her other songs grew on me.
I like her videos a lot. Especially shake it off.
It is fun and you can see that she was able to laugh at herself. A very likeable quality.
For sure. I also really like the song and video for bad blood.
I enjoyed the song more than the video.
What about Blankspace?
I loved that video and song. I thought there was a lot of humor in it as well.
Taylor is fun. Glad you have joined her team.
Ya I don't know I am on her squad but I enjoy her.
It is crazy she is still so young 23. Has released 5 albums already.
What one has the harry styles song?
I knew you were trouble, was on her red album.
Any other big hits on the red album?
We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together was another big one on red.
I did not like that song at all. Found it so annoying and repetitive.
