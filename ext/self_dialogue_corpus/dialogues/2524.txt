I can't wait for football to start. It's the Bills year this year!
I hate to burst your bubble but I don't think so.
They have a new head coach and a solid draft class.
Yeah I know but it takes more than that to win the Super Bowl.
I know but they are moving in the right direction.
True, I still think it will take a few years though.
I agree, I just try to stay optimistic.
Nothing wrong with that! I thought they would draft Chad Kelly.
I thought that too! Glad they didn't though.
How come? He's a great raw talent.
Raw talent, yes, but he's got a lot to work on off the field.
Yeah I hear you there. I think he'll do well fighting for a starting position.
It will probably take a few years before he makes his first start but he will be good.
Yeah I don't hate the guy, I want him to do great!
I think everyone from Buffalo is pulling for him because of his uncle Jim.
Jim Kelly is the best thing to ever happen to that city!
Four straight Super Bowls, I'd say so.
Only team to ever do that in history. I can't believe they couldn't win just one.
It's a touchy subject to talk about in Buffalo.
I know, it's just such a crazy stat!
