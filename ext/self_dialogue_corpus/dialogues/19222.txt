Have you heard my new Bose speakers?
No are they really loud?
Yes when you're listening to music, it makes you feel it.
That is really exciting!
You could bring your iPod over and listen to it.
I think I will. What kind of music do you want to hear?
Honestly any kind is great on the speakers.
Do you think that one song with the heavy bass would be great?
What song is that?
It is that song by Skrillex!
That is one of my favorites.
Do you have any more music that is like Skrillex?
Currently I do not. I can download some music before I head over though.
I think that would be a good idea, just so we have a few more options.
Do you like 90s music more or new music?
Honestly I'm a fan of 90s music more. I know a lot more music in that genre.
I'm more a fan of the new music, but that is okay.
Maybe you could introduce me to a few songs I may not know.
I would love to. You can never have enough music.
I completely agree. That is why I'm able to keep my headphones and all the time.
