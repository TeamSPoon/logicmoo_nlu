Do you believe that Han Solo shot first?
When I saw A New Hope before it's remaster, I think I remember that Greedo shot first.
Me too, I can't believe they edited it like that!
I know, I think it's a dishonor to Han Solo's character.
I don't think Han Solo would of killed someone first.
Yeah, in my opinion it was self-defense.
I am just glad that Han Solo didn't get hit with the bullet lazer.
Me too, otherwise the movies would of turned out differently.
I can't even imagine Star Wars without Han Solo.
Me either!
