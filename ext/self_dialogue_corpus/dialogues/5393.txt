what do you think about Jungle Book?
It was such a brilliant movie, the visuals are insanely good
I can't agree more, the animals in the movie are lifelike, considering they're CG.
yea, Disney might be the only company that can create visuals like that.
yea, what's your most memorable moments from the movie?
It definitely gotta be the snake scene, where the snake try to hypnotize the kid
how about the huge ape scene, the kid climbed a very tall rock to get to talk to the huge ape.
oh right, now that you mentioned, that was a great scene as well
I hope Disney make more excellent 3D iterations of their classic movies
yeah, even adult would be obsessed with those new dazzling visuals.
