So what team are you backing next season for NFL?
I'm backing the Seahawks
Didnt expect you were the type of person to jump on a bandwagon.
What do you mean?
No offense but I feel like over the past few years everyone who doesn't know much about football is hopping on the Seahawks train
Everyone likes the underdog! What do you have against them?
I have nothing against them. I think they're doing well.
Keep in mind as well that I may not be from Seattle, but I am from the northwest. Seahawks is pretty much all we have over here.
Maybe that's why I don't like them. My team is the 49ers
Yes, the San Francisco 49ers are a bit of the hawks' rivals at this point, because of that whole mess with the coach.
Have you ever been to any of the games?
Seattle is nowhere near close to me so unfortunatley not. I hope to one day though.
I'm sure. Seahawks fans seem to be some of the most passionate in the league.
We are for sure! We have a world record to prove it!
What do you mean?
We are actually in the guineess book of world records for being the loudest crowd at a sporting event.
That's cool! I'm sure you wish you were there at that game.
I wish. It was back in 2013.
I bet you I go to a 49ers game before you do.
Let's go to a game where they play each other and we'll settle the score once and for all.
