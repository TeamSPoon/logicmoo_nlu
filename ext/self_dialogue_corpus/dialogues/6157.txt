What's your favorite Disney movie?
Oh, it's so hard to pick! I love Mulan.
I think that Frozen is my favorite.
It's certainly my daughter's favorite! But I'm so tired of listening to "Let it Go."
I love that song. I could listen to it a million times.
Elsa's a great character. But I prefer Mulan. I mean, she saves China!
Well, Elsa saves the kingdom from being frozen.
Yes, from a problem she causes! Plus, I think Mulan's romance with Shang is cute.
But Frozen has that great family relationship between the sisters.
I'll still take Mulan, but I know Frozen has all those fans for a reason.
