What do you think about pop music?
I don't know, that's such a wide term.     Start with one artist.
OK.      Maybe Justin Timberlake.
I really like him when he shows up on Jimmy Fallon and SNL.
Yes, he is always very funny.    His dancing is amazing too.
I really like that one song off the Trolls soundtrack, do you remember the name.
Yes, that song is called Can't Stop the Feeling!
Didn't it win an award too?
Yes, it won a Grammy award, and I think was nominated for an Oscar.
Wow!    He really is quite talented.
