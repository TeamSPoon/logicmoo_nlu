What is your favorite Disney Movie?
The original Beauty and the Beast
That is a great movie, I love the talking candlestick!
Yes, he is great, but I must admit Chip is my favorite!
Did you know that they have an extended version of it on DVD?
No, what are some of the different scenes?
There is a musical scence where the castle creatures sing about wanting to be human again!
Interesting, I think my favorite part is when the beast reveals the library and you can tell that Belle is starting to fall in love with the Beast
My favorite part is the be our guest dinner scene!
True, that is a great scene, especially the try the grey stuff!
