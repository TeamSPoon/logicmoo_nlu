What's your favorite part of the Goblet of Fire?
I really like when Harry has to go underwater to save Ron.
I liked that part too. I thought it was very brave when he tried to save both Hermione and Ron.
So did I. But it was scary to me when the mermaid yelled at him that he could only take one person!
I like that movie a lot because of how Harry and Cedric help each other through the challenges.
It was nice of Cedric to tell Harry to take his golden egg underwater, and before that Harry told him that the first challenge involved dragons.
It just made it that much sadder when Cedric died.
Oh I know! And when Harry came back and everyone was cheering until they realized he had Cedric's body with him.
Do you think everybody thought he killed Cedric?
I think some people still do think he killed Cedric. Nobody wants to believe that Voldemort is back again.
