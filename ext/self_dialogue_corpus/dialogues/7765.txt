Hey, did you hear that there is a Harry Potter marathon this weekend?
No! When? What channel?
ABC network! I think it's called Freeform now, but it comes on friday through Saturday Starting with Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone.
Awesome! It's been so long since I watched them all back to back, but I'm not sure if I am ready to see Snape die agai.
Good point. He was such a deep character with so many angles. Remember when he smacked Harry and Ron on their heads during Potions Exams?
Yes, so funny! My favorite line of his was always "Turn to page 394".
That is an iconic quote. Much like Hermoine's "It's leviOsa, not leviosar".
Oh, Hermoine, she's another great character with a lot of depth and character. I'll never forget when she punched Draco!
I think that punch was what made Ron truly fall in love with Hermoine.
I think you're right. Man, it took him forever to finally realize that he loved her.
