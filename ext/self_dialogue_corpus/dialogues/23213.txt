What's your favorite Jack Nicholson movie?
Oh there are so many.
Yes, but is there one you like more than the others?
Yeah, probably One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
Oh that's going way back. Is that the one where he's in the crazy house?
Yeah, he's a criminal that feigns lunacy to serve time in an asylum rather than prison.
Yeah, I remember that one. I recall Danny Devito and Christopher Lloyd were in that one as well.
Yeah, kind of a sad ending where he gets lobotomized.
Oh that's right, and then the big Indian suffocates him.
Yeah that's right
I really liked his work in The Shining.
Yes, that's a classic.
That whole hotel was insane looking.
Yeah, everything about that movie was creepy.
Based on a Stephen King novel.
Right, but quite a bit different than the novel.
Received the Stanley Kubrick treatment.
Yeah, you could say that.
There are still some scenes in it that I don't fully understand.
Likewise on my part. Weird movie overall.
