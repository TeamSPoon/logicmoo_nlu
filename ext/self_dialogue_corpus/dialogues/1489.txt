Almost football season!
Yes, NFL summer camp just ended and preseason starts in four weeks.
Patriots might win it all again.
Another great team for them this year?
Yes. Actually I thought the Cowboys had a chance last year to win it all.
Yea, their playoff experience was too young last year.
They have a good chance, but we will see.
Are there any quarterbacks throughout the league that are standouts?
Drew Brees is still with the New Orleans Saints.
He's been around awhile.
Yea, probablya few more years left for him.
Aaron Rodgers still is quarterback for the Green Bay Packers.
He's been there awhile. But he's still good.
Have they been in the playoffs lately.
Yea, they make the playoffs almost every year.
Of course, Tom Brady always brings the Patriots to the playoffs.
Yes, and beyond!
Another great quarterback is Prescott for the Cowboys.
He's pretty young though and doesn't have enough experience.
Well,we'll see who wins it all!!
