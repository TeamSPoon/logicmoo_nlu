So i noticed some odd things with Tampa's schedule.
How so?
Well, for starters They play The Falcons twice as well and the Panthers and the Saints.
Yeah, that is a bit strange.
Serious. Especially since the Falcons and the Saints are in our division.
Well, it sounds like the Bucs better have it together in those games just for ranking.
Agreed, by why such limited diversity?
I don't know.
Well, in the beginning, the Bears should be no problem.
True.
Now the Patriots are gonna give us a bloddy nose.
Wouldnt it be great if we got lucky and beat them hard.
Yes, it would. After that it's gonna be Arizona and Buffalo. Shouldnt be that hard to win.
Arizona maybe, Bills, no problem.
Then it's Panthers, Saints...... where the divisional rivalry begins.
Yes, the Bucs will have to be cautious those next 5 or 6 games.
Those are the games that are gonna define playoff position.
Agreed.
The last three games are the same way, Falcons, Panthers and Saints.
Ugh, lot of stress in those last three games.
