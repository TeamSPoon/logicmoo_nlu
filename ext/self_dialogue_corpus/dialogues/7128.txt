I love about every movie that Disney puts out
Oh yeah,me too
I always loved the movie Beauty and the beast
I don't remember liking that one
Really? well what about finding nemo?
Oh yeah,I really liked that one
My daughter has watched that one about 100 times already
Really? My little boy has watched the movie Cars about that many times
My daughter never watches cars but loves Cinderella
My little boy never got into Cinderella.I can't wait to see what else Disney will put out
