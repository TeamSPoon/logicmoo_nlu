Have you listened to the new Katy Perry album?
No, I've heard a lot about it though! What did you think?
I like it! I'm a big Katy Perry fan, and I think a lot of the criticism of the album has been unfair.
What is your favorite song on her new record?
I like Roulette and Hey Hey Hey a lot.
I will have to check those out. I love Bruno Mars new song.
Oh, what is his new song? I don't think I've heard it.
Its called "That's What I Like."
I think I've seen the video. Is it where he dances around in an empty room?
Yep! It is the best.
