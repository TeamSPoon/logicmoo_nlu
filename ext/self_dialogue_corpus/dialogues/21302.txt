Hey mom, can we see a movie today?
It is the weekend, so I would allow just today.
Thank you! Please let me see the new King Arthur movie.
That one does look good, but I know the director makes violent movies.
This one is more stylized mom, the violence isn't too gory or bloody.
I just worry a bit about you getting exposed to that, but it has been getting good reviews.
I know that Jude Law and the guy from Vikings is in it.
Oh wow I love that show Vikings!
I know, that is why I brought it up!
We can check this out, I may want to watch a trailer first.
Let me get my computer, I saw the trailer and immediately wanted to see it.
Do you know what it is rated?
Yeah! It is rated PG-13 so it won't be too gratutitous.
That is a great word! I think we should see it!
Jude Law is a great actor and I believe he is the villain.
Oh and I see it is directed by Guy Ritchie, I know he is a bit violent but he is talented as well.
I think we will like it!
HOpefully the accents don't get too off track, that makes me nuts.
I think they are mostly British actors, so it will feel more real.
Let's go see it!
