What do you think are the best all-time Rolling Stones songs?
How about Beast of Burden? I think that's the name, isn't it?
That's a good one. I like Start Me Up.
Yeah, I can definitely imagine Mick strutting around for that one.
I can't believe he's still going. He just had a baby.
I wonder if he ever imagined how successful the Stones would be.
You've got to give him credit. But don't forget Keith Richards.
Or the drummer? I think it was Charlie Watts.
I think so. He always had a cool vibe.
I think Charlie Watts was supposed to be the sane member, the straight man, as they say.
Usually the drummer is the crazy one.
That's true. I think they just get in a rhythmic zone and don't have to think too much.
I should have been a rock drummer. But I'd probably lose my hearing.
I don't even think you need to hear. You can just feel the beat through your body.
Who are the other great rock drummers?
Maybe Neil Peart, from Rush.
I think he wrote most of their lyrics too.
I always liked their lyrics. I don't get why so many people hate Rush.
I don't know. They kind of did their own thing for a long time.
They make make you think, even when you're having a good time.
