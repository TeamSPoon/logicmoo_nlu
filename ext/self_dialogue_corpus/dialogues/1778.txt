So do you have a sleeper team this year?
Laugh if you want but I am going to pick the Jags
What? No way.
I realize that they are at least a few years away from anything real, but they have good pieces
Um, I guess?
Well a sleeper to me just means it will sneak up on people. I think they have it.
Yeah I think you are dillustional.
No, look. They have decent D.
Ok, I will grant that.
Their QB is acceptable.
Yeah, no comment there.
Their running game is adequate.
And I will conceed they might be able to sneak up on a few teams.
Exactly! I fugire if they steal a few here and there they might be in good shape
I guess so...
Trust me you will be surprised
Well I will be shocked if they win more than 8 games
So would I.
But progress is progress
Exactly my point!
