What action movie has the best bank heist scene?
That has to be Heat.
Of course, that really was a fantastic scene.
Yes, and the rest of the movie was great as well.
What did you think of the diner scene?
That was an amazing scene with two of the best American actors going toe to toe.
Yeah, that was there first scene together in any movie, correct?
Yeah, that is correct.
Who did you like better, De Niro or Pacino?
Pacino was a bit too over the top for me, so I'll choose De Niro.
