They were such a creative unique talent.
I know.  My whole family would end up singing things like Yellow Submarine and I am the Walrus at our get-togethers.
What do you think about the Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds song?  Do you think it was about drugs?
I don't know.  My Mom said that it was rumored it was about LSD --- Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds.
Oh, you know my favorite --- The Long and Winding Road.   It was almost like church music.
I know, I heard that they only decided on adding the orchestra later on during the recording.
They had so much to say about the world and the whole culture they were playing for at that time.
I don't think we have anybody out there today that does quite the same thing at all.
They really were the beginning of a new era in music style.
There will never be another group like them.
