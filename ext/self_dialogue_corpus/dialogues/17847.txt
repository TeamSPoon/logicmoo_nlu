Do you like indie music?
It depends on the band there is a lot of butt rock out there that claims to be indie rock.
Surely it does depend on the quality of the artist but I like The Get Up Kids and People Under the Stairs.
Oh okay those are some fun bands that have some good hits.
I am also a huge fan of The Shins and Bright Eyes  but that is because I really grew up with those bands.
What would you say is your favorite band of all times?
I think that is an impossible question and I really can't answer it because there is just so much good music. Do you have a favorite band?
Yes I would say I have a favorite band and that would be Rise Against because they where a band I came up with.
Do you know of Tom Waits?
Yeah, he is from Pomona California and was born in 1949. I would say he is the music for the author Jack Kerouac.
Do you know of Rage Against the Machine?
Yes I do and I find them to be an amazing band that just makes me feel so cool when I am listening to them.
They are like the perfect band from Los Angeles, they also just have such a grunge like style.
Yeah totally but also it's got that metal element that I so enjoy.
Do you like death metal?
I like screamo but am more on the typical  metal side if there was a scale.
One band that I kind of hate is Maroon 5, they are the worst and on occasion they show up in my music library and I find it so frustrating.
Sure I hate them too but why don't you just delete them from your computer. Seems like a simple solution
All the music in my library is backed up so it becomes sort of impossible to delete music once in becomes a part of the library.
Well that is a problem but there is never a problem with having too much music.
