I'm really psyched for the next Star Wars film.
Yeah, Force Awakens was pretty cool. I was afraid when Disney bought it from Lucas.
Why? You didn't think they would put Donald Duck in it or something?
Well, that's just silly. I was afraid they wouldn't allow the dark story lines.
They tossed a lot of the EU. But What happened to Han and Leia was pretty damned dark.
So was Rogue One.
I really loved that they fitted it into A New Hope so well.
My dad was a Disney exec, he said they never neglect characters or series with a following.
Disney seems to be listening to George Lucas, without letting him screw up things.
Yeah, like those prequels. God.
