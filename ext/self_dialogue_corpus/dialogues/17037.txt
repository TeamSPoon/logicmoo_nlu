Do you want to go with me to see the Drum Corps International Championship this summer?
What is Drum Corps International?
It is an organization that promotes music through professional Drum and Bugle Corps performances.
What is a Drum and Bugle Corps? You mean like an old fashioned marching band?
It is a group of young musicians who compete in a series of tournaments around the country. They are similar to marching bands but they don't have a woodwind section.
Do they just play music or do they march too?
Actually they have a field show that is very similar to a marching band half time show. It's very exciting.
That sounds interesting. How do the musicians get into the groups?
They audition by sending in a recording of their playing and if they are asked to come audition in person it's a big honor.
Does New Mexico have a Drum Corps?
No, only some states have them. California actually has several.
Oh, so we have to go to another state to hear the competition?
No, they travel around the country and put on exhibition shows at different stadiums. The closest exhibition to us is in Albuquerque.
An exhibition isn't a judged show is it?
No, there are several regional shows where the Corps are professionally ranked. The closest one to New Mexico is in San Antonio, Texas.
How far is that?
It's about twelve hours away, but it's totally worth the trip. The music is outstanding and the field show is choreographed like a dance.
That sounds awesome! How many Corps will compete in San Antonio?
This year there are twenty three Corps attending. The show is at the Alamodome on Saturday July 22nd.
Okay, I'm game. Let's plan to go!
