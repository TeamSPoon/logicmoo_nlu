Do you like the snow scene in The Empire Strikes Back?
Yes. I thought the monster was terrifying.
That part was remade in the updated version.
Really?
Yes. They originally did not show much of the snow monster
I did not know that.
There are many changes to the old films.
I wish I could see the original.
Me too.
It probably had a much more organic feel.
