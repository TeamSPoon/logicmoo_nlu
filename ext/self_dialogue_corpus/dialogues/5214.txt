So what was the original one with Maleficent?
She was the big baddie in Sleeping Beauty.
Right. How did that one go?
It was sort of similar to Snow White.
Oh, how so?
Well, Princess Aurora, that was her name, was cured to die but instead fell into a long sleep because of guardian angels.
Then what happens?
Exactly what you think. She has to be awoken by a kiss. Prince Phillip was the prince.
And everyone lives happily ever after?
Don't they always?
