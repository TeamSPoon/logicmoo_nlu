You ever think it's weird that so many Disney channel stars can sing?
What, you mean like Miley Cyrus? Wasn't that the whole point?
Well yeah, but I mean like the others that were just actors at first, like Selena Gomez.
She was the chick on Wizards, right?
Yeah, and then Demi Lovato too. They were originally meant to be just actors, I thought.
And Hillary Duff was an actress too, right?
Yeah, and she sang. I wonder if it was just an accident or if they did that on purpose?
I don't know, but I'm a huge fan of Demi.
Really? Her old stuff or her new stuff?
New; I haven't really heard much of her old stuff.
She got big when I was in high school, so I listened to a lot of her songs.
Which one was your favourite?
Well, I was a big fan of Don't Forget back in the day.
Haha, a classic break up song?
Yeah, super angsty and cliche, I know. But I liked it.
Hey, wasn't she on Camp Rock?
Dude, I totally forgot about that!
She sang in that, right? So they must have known she could sing.
I really liked the acoustic version of her song, too. What was it called?
"This is Me," I think. I'll pull it up now.
