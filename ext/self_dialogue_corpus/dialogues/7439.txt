Have you heard about some of the theories on Frozen and how other disney characters make appearances in the movie?
I have heard that Flynn and Rapunzel are in one of the scenes preceeding the coronation.
Yes, there is also a theory about connection to other movies?
Is that the part where they say Ariel used to play in the shipwreck from Ana and Elsa's parents?
Yes, but also that perhaps her parents were not dead, and were on a stranded Island.
I heard that one too, that they were like Jane and Tarzan?
I am not sure about that, but I heard that the reason Rapunzel was there was because Elsa's parents were traveling to her wedding when they died.
I heard that one too, very interesting fan theories!
Also I heard that the Let it Go song was added after they nearly finished the movie.
I do not think that is true, but if it is, that is cool.
