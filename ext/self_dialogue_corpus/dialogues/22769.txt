Saul Bass is my hero.
Who? The Satanic Verses guy?
That's Salman Rushdie.
Ah, yes. Almost the same thing. Probably.
If you're creative about it, maybe. Saul Bass was a graphic designer.
So what did he do, comic books?
Not that I'm aware of. He did logos and title sequences for movies and things .
Like the Star Wars scroll?
That wasn't him, but -- that kind of thing. Except, more mod.
Pardon?
Pardon what? Mod?
Are we talking Beatles here?
Well, not -- I mean, sort of, but no. The modernist movement, that brings us Helvetica and plastic bucket seats.
I think I skipped this chapter. Can you be kind to me?
Modernism is all about putting the rational and the practical above the emotional. This is where we get the phrase "cool," as in keeping a steady head, which in turn is a desirable trait: "He's so cool, he's above it all!"
Sounds kind of... I don't know. Not classist, exactly, but there's something that feels off here.
It's aspirational, so it's a super middle-class notion, which totally took off with the Baby Boomers, because, you know. But basically, it's about stripped-down elegance: ridding yourself of unneeded emotional baggage in favor of the bare skeleton of what you need to function.
Austerity as an art form? Barfaloney. Why is this guy your hero, again?
Saul Bass? Oh, he just did lots of cool stuff. The intros to most of Hitchcock's late-era stuff, like Psycho and Vertigo and North by Northwest.
North by Northwest... I think I remember the intro to that. It reminds me of Mad Men.
