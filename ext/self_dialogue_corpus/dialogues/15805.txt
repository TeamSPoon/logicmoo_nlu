What do you think about the band KISS?
They're not bad.  They've been around for a while, huh?
Oh yeah.  Since the early-1970s.
That's cool.  I don't know a lot of their songs, but Rock n' Roll All Night is pretty good.
Do you know any others?
Just Beth, Strutter, and Shout It Out Loud.
I love Shout It Out Loud!
Me too.  It's probably my favorite.  What are you favorites?
I really like Love Gun, Detroit Rock City, God of Thunder, and Calling Dr. Love.
Oh yeah!  I really like those too.  What others?
Lick It Up, Beth, Black Diamond, and Psycho Circus.
Oh cool.  Psycho Circus is pretty great too.
I know, I could listen to that on repeat.
What about their make-up though?
Yeah, I think that's what appealed to me the most when I first started listening to them.  That, and their movies.
What movies?
KISS Meets the Phantom of the Park and Detroit Rock City!  You've never seen them?
No, are they good?
The Phantom is okay, but Detroit Rock City is one of my favorite movies!  You should watch it!
I will.  Thanks!
