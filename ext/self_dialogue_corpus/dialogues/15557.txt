Have you listened to America's top 40 this week?
No, what station is it on and what time?
Its usually on around 8am in the morning on Y100 on sunday
Oh no! I always sleep in during that time!
Well next week try to tune in!
Why did you mention it to me?
Because when we carpool you keep putting on those golden oldies songs, frankly I'm tired of them!
Wow Frank! I'm so sorry you feel that way!
Yeah I didnt want to hurt your feelings!
Well which song was number one this week?!
It was Stay by Alessia Cara and Zedd
Hmm I never heard of them
Well just give the music a chance
Yeah seems like totally new music to me!
Yeah well your 25 years old not 52 years old remember that!
HAHA very funny (sarcastically)
Yeah you need an update
well thanks for keeping me in mind
No problem
Hope to hear some new music soon!
