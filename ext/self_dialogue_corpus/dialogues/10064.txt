I watched Patriot's Day this weekend.
I didn't think it showed enough action.
Really? I thought it was just enough.
Yes there wasn't much in the way of chases.
Well, it's based on a true story so they couldn't deviate from that much.
I understand. I was a good movie though other than that.
I thought that it made you really reflect on these people as actual people.
Yes sometimes in movies it's hard to separate fact and fiction.
This was really someones life.
Yes and they did a great job honoring them.
