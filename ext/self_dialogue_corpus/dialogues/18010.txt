Who is your favorite rock band?
I'm a country fan. Most of the rock bands I know are from the 80's.
Okay, so who was your favorite 80's rock band?
That's a tough one. Foriegner, Chicago, Journey, Loverboy...
Yeah, there were a lot of them. So who was your favorite?
Pushy, pushy. I guess I"d have to say my favorite is probably Fleetwood Mac.
Excellent choice. They aren't an 80's band though. I think they were founded in sixties or seventies.
Okay. Whatever. I listened to them in eighties. I was a fan of them in 80's.
Gotcha. So what other rock groups did you, or do you, like?
Well, I've always been a fan of the Stones, the Beatles, I like Def Leppard.
See, you know some good bands.
Thanks.
What about more hard rock stuff? Kiss, AC/DC, Black Sabbath.
I don't know a single Black Sabbath song. I've heard Kiss songs, from the movies and such, but I've never really been a fan. I know there are some AC/DC songs I like, but honestly, but I don't know which ones they are.
What about more modern groups? REM? Counting Crows? things like that.
I like that Stand song by REM, I think.
I know what song you mean.
If you play some of their songs, I might recognize another REM song or some COunting Crows songs.
I guess next time we should have a conversation about country music.
I'd be a lot better informed about it.
