Where do you fall on the Britney vs Christina debate?
I think Christina has the better voice, so her.
I agree, but Britney has the better songs.
Well I just think that Britney has a better production team.
All is fair in love and pop!
But Christina has the chops to do more outside of pop music.
Do you think she will?
I don't know, but I hope she does a jazz record. Or classical pop.
That would be a total surprise, I think.
Lady GaGa did it. Maybe Christina will too!
