I feel like Hollywood is making too many remakes.
Huh? What do you mean? Like what?
A remake of The Birds is in the works. That's a classic Hitchcock film. It's already perfection. Leave it alone.
Well, you gotta bring it to a new generation. Kids today aren't gonna watch black and white movies that are super old.
Nonsense. You're not giving people any credit. They will if they are interested in film.
Think about how cool the CGI birds are gonna be.
*Groans*
Sorry, but it will probably be superior to the original due to better special effects.
Agree to disagree on that. They also remade Carrie. Carrie was perfect. Why remake it?
Did you see the remake?
No. And I don't want to.
Then how do you know that it didn't surpass the original?
I have read many one star reviews of it.
Well, maybe they were written by old, grumpy people.
Like me? Ha! They are also remaking Death Wish and The Craft.
Okay.
Big Trouble in Little China, Don't Look Now, and turning Dumbo in a live action film.
Cool! The Dumbo thing sounds awesome.
You're probably pretty excited about the CGI flying elephant, huh?
Oh yeah!
