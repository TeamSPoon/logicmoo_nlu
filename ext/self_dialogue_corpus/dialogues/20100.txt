Did you get to see Guardians of the Galaxy 2?
Of course!  I felt like the entire World went to see it when it was released.
It did make a lot of money.  But that seems pretty normal for Marvel movies these days.
Yes, it's crazy how much money those movies make internationally.
So what is your favorite Marvel movie?
Wow, that's a tough one.  There have been so many now.
I know.  They make like five of them each year!
I'm still going to have to go with the one that kicked off this whole thing.
Iron Man, right?
Yes, Iron Man.  Almost 10 years old now, but it's still a terrific movie.
And like you said, it's success paved the way for all these additional superhero movies.
Yes.  I don't think there's been a bad Marvel movie since then though.  They have all been good.
Agreed.  I think they have the superhero movie recipe down perfectly.
Yes.  Just a lot of fun without taking themselves too seriously.
So don't know about my favorite movie, but my favorite character is Captain America.
Yes, I like his movies as well.  Did you catch the latest Thor movie trailer?
Of course!  It got a lot of views online.
What do you think about it?
It's interesting they cast Cate Blanchett.  I'm looking forward to seeing her in this movie.
I know!  They brought in a Oscar-winning actress!
