Are you an NFL fan?
Yes, have you heard about the financial classes they allow the rookies to take.
I have. It is really nice of the NFL to offer and encourage such things.
The players get out of college and have huge salaries. They need help managing it.
It also promotes a positive image on the NFL.
Other sports should learn from the NFL.
The NFL also promotes community causes.
I heard Drew Brees supports Play 60.
What is that?
It is a movement to encourage kids to play outside. The NFL supports it.
That is wonderful. I know the NFL has been promoting safety of its players.
That reflects really well on them.
It has come at the expense of upsetting some fans because they have enacted some rule changes.
Player safety must come first. The game is still entertaining for thr fans.
The NFL also promotes Breast Cancer Awareness.
I have seen the players wear pink cleats and gloves.
It is a great cause.
I like how the NFL supports vets. I love watching America's game of the week.
I like seeing former President Bush do the coin toss for the NFL games.
I have never seen that happen. That sounds cool.
