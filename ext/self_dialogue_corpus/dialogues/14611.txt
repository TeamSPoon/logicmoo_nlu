Hello Justin did you watch the game yesterday?
Are you talking about the basketball game last night?
Yes.
Yeah, it was really good.
I like how Steph Curry hit that 3 pointer at the buzzer.
Yeah but just wait until next game we are going to win .
Golden state has the number 1 position and the team really has handles
But my team with Kevin Garnet plays defense really well.
I think we're going to win it all.
Think what you wish.
Seriously i think you guys will loose just like years ago.
Wait, who won the champioship last year? I believe it was the warriors
Yes but we got this one this year
Are you bush tomorrow
No.
Maybe we can play one on one before the basketball game
ok cool
hit me up if you can .
Ok bring your baskeball
ok
