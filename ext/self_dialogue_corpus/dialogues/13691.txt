I so enjoyed Lady Gaga's half time superbowl  show.
Her voice has such great pitch.
My favorite song is born this way.
I really liked her on Tony Bennett 90th birthday show.
She is such a great showmanship with her songs.
My favorite song is bad romance.
Lady Gaga is young and refreshing.
I am so glad she stopped wearing those ridiculous outfits.
It is so nice that her and Tony Bennett sing so well together.
Lady Gaga has such a wonderful voice. It is so easy to listen to.
