Did you see the 2017 Oscars best dresses?
Yes I really think Emma Stone was the best!
What? I totally though Scarlet Johansan's dress was perfect fit her perfectly!
No way Emma's beaded golden 20's style gown was amazing.
Well Scarlet's was way more unique!
How so? Didn't really look like it belonged at the Oscars if you ask me.
What do you mean by that?
The dress looked way to casual and the style was dull!
Yeah well Emma's was  not unique at all.
How's that?
Just a copy of a millon dresses from the 20s.
I don't know about that.
It totally was just look up dresses from the 20s you'll see what I mean.
Either way I still think Emma looked classy.
I also think her shoes were ugly.
I didn't much like the shoes either.
They were too plain and similar to her dress.
Yeah I agree. I gotta say though I think Leslie Man's dress was a total disater.
Yes! It was so gaudy and looked like mustard.
Yeah like a bad prom dress from the 80s.
