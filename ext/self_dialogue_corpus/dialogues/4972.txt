Are you a baseball fan?
Not at all.
How come?
I like sports with Asians and there aren't enough in baseball.
What about Ichiro?
Yeah he was pretty awesome.
Did you follow him?
Nah, I guess the problem is the sport itself is what I find boring.
Baseball is the most exciting sport on the planet.
How do you figure?
It's the only sport where nothing can happen for hours, and then in one instance you could change everything.
No it's not.
Name another then.
Soccer.
Not really. Soccer, they are always moving.
That is true.
Plus, I hate soccer.
Me too, but i hate baseball more. Just goes to show how truly awful baseball is.
You're the worst.
Hehe
