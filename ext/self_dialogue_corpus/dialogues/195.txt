Have you seen Wonder Woman yet?
Yes I finally did and lovedit.
I thought Gal Gadot was great as Wonder Woman.
So did I. I loved hte part where she went through No Man Land.
Yes that part made me cry. I'm really excited about Justice League now.
Me too. I saw the preview in Wonder Woman.
Ya, so did I. It looks great.
How many movies have there been getting ready for Justice League?
I think at least
2.
