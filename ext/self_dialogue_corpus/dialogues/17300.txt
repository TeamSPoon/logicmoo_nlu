I really love the band.
When did you hear about them?
About a month a go.
How did you find about about them?
A friend played me a youtube video.
Are they big online?
I am not sure.
Do they have a lot of videos on youtube?
Yes. After I found out about them, I spent like two hours listening to their youtube playlist.
Do they have a lot of views?
I did not really check their view count.
Have they performed on any of the last night talk shows?
I did not see any videos of them performing on any of those shows?
What about on SNL
I doubt it.
Why do you doubt it?
Beacuse they are an Indie group
Indie groups can't be on SNL?
They are also from the UK
I get your point.
