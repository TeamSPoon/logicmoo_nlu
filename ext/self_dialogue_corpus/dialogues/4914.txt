Hey what do you think about the Red Sox pitching situation.
What a mess. They need to get a couple starters and soon.
Yeah. It's too bad about Steven Wright.
Yeah. He can really eat up innings.
I hope David Price ends up coming back soon too.
Yeah that would be great. Hopefully he's fully healthy.
So who do you think they should bring in to pitch.
I don't know. There are a lot of starters out there who are free agents.
I think we should take a look at Jake Peavy.
Yeah he did well for the Sox before. But he's getting old.
Yeah he is but I think he'd do fine as a number 5 starter.
Yeah, I wouldn't expect too much from him but he could get the job done.
I also think they should look at Mat Latos.
What's happened to him? He can't seem to stay on one team.
I know. I don't know what his deal is.
Do you think he could turn it around and pitch well.
I do. I think he's just needs the right situation and the Red Sox could be that team.
It'd be interesting to see how he did in Boston.
I just hope they don't trade for Quintana from the White Sox.
Yeah. As much as I'd like him on the team, I don't think they should trade anymore top prospects.
