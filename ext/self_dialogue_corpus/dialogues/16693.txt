Do you like Beyonce?
She is okay.
Okay? that is gross underestimation.
What is special about her music?
Her voice is angelic
I think she is overrated.
Show me one female artist better than her.
Alicia Keys' lyrics are better.
Beyonce is a certified poet.
Do you listen to any other musician?
Yes, but Beyonce mostly.
I guess you are obsessed with her music
Rightly so. Who do you listen to?
I like jazz.
No wonder you don't like Beyonce
It is a matter of taste.
I listen to Jazz sometimes too.
Do you like it?
I use it only for specific purposes
Oh, great taste.
