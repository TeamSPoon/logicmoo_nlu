Who do you think is better: Katy Perry or Lady Gaga?
Lady Gaga, for sure.
Why is that?
Well, Lady Gaga is not afraid to be herself and she knows how to sing really well.
I agree. Personally, I think Artpop was a flop, but I still listened to a few of the songs from there.
There weren't good ones on that album, but her other albums were amazing.
Born This Way was the best song she's made.
I think Poker Face was good, but that might just be because I like to gamble.
True. Does she have new music coming out?
I'm not sure! She might, but she hasn't promoted it.
