Hey how are you?
Great, just went to see Guardians for the 3rd time.
I've only seen it once, but I'll definitely watch it again.
I love the music from the movie.
I wonder where I can find the soundtrack.
Don't know but I'll bet it's available.
Maybe on youtube.
If I see it I'll let you know.
What are you up to this weekend.
Will probably take in a movie.
Are there any good movies coming up.
The Thor/Hulk movie must be coming sometime soon?
I was really disapointed in Logan.
I know. they made the Wolverine too dar.
I like backstory and Logan didn't have any.
Yep, they just dropped you into an apocalypse with no backstory.
My brother gave me two tickets to AMC, want to be my guest next week?
Cool, I'm always up for a movie. I'll buy the popcorn.
Okay, let's see what movie is playing next week.
Okay, maybe check Rotten Tomatoes.
