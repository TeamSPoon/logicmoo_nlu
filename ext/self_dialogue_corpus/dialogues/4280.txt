I had never noticed how many thriller movies the guy from Broke Back mountain has been in.
Which guy from that movie?
Jake Gyllenhaal.
He had one last year, with Amy Adams.
Nocturnal Animals, I think it was called.
Yes, did you see it?
I have not got around to seeing it. You?
Yep, it is a classic type thriller.
In what way?
The movie feed you bits of info, while keeping you on the edge of your seat. Guessing the motive and ending.
