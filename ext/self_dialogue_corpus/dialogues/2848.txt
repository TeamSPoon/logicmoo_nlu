Well, Peyton Manning's retired. And his team's doing okay.
Okay, what else is new?
Uhhh, not much.
What about the sports commentators?
Uhhh, nothing special about them.
Well, how else are we supposed to do things around here?
Uhhh, just by talking?
Sure, but what about the injured players and the other things?
Who cares about them? They'll come back!
Wow, you must not like football.
Well, it's not interesting to me.
Uhhh, then why are you talking about some cool football players?
Cause, it's just part of mingling.
Oh, okay.
See, if you know how to talk to people, and know what to talk about, you'll get along.
Hey, there's Magic Johnson, right now!
Who's he?
A cool basketball player.
Meh, I think he's okay.
Dude, he's like one of the basketball legends!
