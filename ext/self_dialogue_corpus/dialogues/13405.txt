I wish I had a light saber.
Like the one in the STAR WARS movies?
Yes. They could cut through anything.
They were like swords.
It was like they were in a duel at the end of the original movie.
They got in those duels in several if not all of the movies.
When they hit each other it sounded strange.
It sounded like electricity hitting each other.
It went right through Ben Kenobie.
That was a sad scene.
