Have you heard that a live action Mulan movie is being made?
Yeah I'm excited, Mulan is one of my favorite movies.
Mine too I used to watch it all the time as a kid.
I still know all the lyrics to I'll Make a Man Out of You.
That's my favorite song! And the training montage during that song is great.
I really love the dramatic sequence where Mulan cuts her hair and takes her father armor to go war for him.
Also that awesome scene where she takes out the Hun army with an avalanche.
And there's so much humor in that movie too. Mushu had great jokes.
Eddie Murphy as Mushu is hilarious.
Cri-Kee and Mulan's horse were funny too.
