Are you looking forward to seeing Wonder Woman?
Not really.
Why do you say that?
It seems like some of the movie looks over produced.
Do you not like comic films?
I love them, the MCU is one of the best things to happen to movies lately.
What about DC?
I think they do good with Batman but thats it.
Did you not like Suicide Squad?
No I though it was boring.
You might be the first person I have heard that from.
You could say that but the fact remains it was boring.
I dont know if I agree I though it moved perfectly.
It was not terrible, just nothing to write home about.
Will Smith did a great job in it.
Jared Leto if anything was better than anyone in it
Margot Robbie did a good job too.
I think she is just eye candy.
She killed that role!
Not really she seemed flat in the entire thing
