Did you have fun at the concert last night?
Yeah. It was a little weird though.
What was weird about it?
Well, we didn't realize that it was a cover band.
What kind of songs did they play?
Lots of different stuff. There was some David Bowie, and then a Sting song.
That doesn't sound like a lot of fun.
It was a little off at first. It got better though.
How?
Well, they started taking requests.
Oh, that does sound like fun. Did you ask for anything?
I was feeling tame. But the crowd really got into it.
So what did you hear?
There were some songs by The Police. And the Red Hot Chili Peppers.
Was there anything you wish you had requested?
Honestly, I wanted them to play something silly.
Something silly?
Yeah, like a Weird Al song or something super girly that wouldn't fit them.
That would have been fun.
I'm sad I didn't go for it!
