Who do you think is favored to win the afc this year.
New England has to be favorites,right?
I believe they are.
As they should be.
I think they're favored every year.
Top flight organization.
Yes they are.
I believe New England has a 96.2% chance to make the playoffs and 92% chance to win the division.
The division should be a piece of cake for them.
It is a weak division.
The steelers are rated at a 75% chance for the playoffs.
They should make the playoffs.
I agree.
Then it drops down to a 56% probability for the raiders to make the playoffs.
Then everybody else is bunched together.
Who's predictions are these?
This is from ESPN.
They have New England at over a 50% probability of making it to the SUPERBOWL.
Wow,nice to be a New England fan.
Every year you have a great chance to make it to the SUPERBOWL.
