How is your favorite Star Wars character?
Original trilogy, prequels, or modern?
Original Trilogy.
Ok. Salacious Crumb.
Who is Salacious Crumb?
He is the little monkey rat guy who sits on Jabba's shoulder.
Haha, I know him, why him?
Well 2 reasons. I wonder if he is like a cat, or a dog, or sentient, like a man.
That is a deep question. 2?
I like his laugh.
