What do you think of the 2018 Indianapolis Colts?
I'll be honest, I haven't paid much attention this offseason.
Do you think they will be a good team?
The Colts play in a weak division so they should be okay.
What about the head coach Chuck Pagano?
I personally don't think he is a good coach.
Why is that?
The best season the Colts have had with him was when he wasn't the coach because of his cancer.
I guess that is true.
I think the Colts need to get a good head coach like Jon Gruden.
Why Jon Gruden?
The Colts have Andrew Luck and right now they are wasting him.
How are the wasting Andrew Luck?
Luck is in the early prime of his career and the Colts have a below average team.
The Colts weren't a bad team last year.
The Colts weren't bad because they have a great quarterback, Andrew Luck.
So if you had to guess how many wins the Colts will have this years.  How many do you say?
I say they win 8 to 10 games.
Do you think that is enough to make the playoffs.
I think that's enough to win their division and make the playoffs.
