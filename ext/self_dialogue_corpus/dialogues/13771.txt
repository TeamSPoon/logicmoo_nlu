What do you think of Lady Gaga's music video Bad Romance.
Oh that one is my favorite. She looks so hot in that video.
What was your favorite outfit in the video?
The white one when she climbing out of the eggs. That hat was crazy.
Do you remember the weird jaw pieces the men wore?
Yes that guy wearing the gold one was hot. What was your favorite outfit in the video?
I think the sparkling silver one she wore for most of the dancing.
I loved the headpiece on that outfit.
It kind of looked like a chandelier.
She was in really good shape for that video.
