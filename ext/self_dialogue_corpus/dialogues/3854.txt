So what did you think of that 'Primal Fear' movie we saw last night?
I thought it was creepy and depressing.
You didn't enjoy it at all?
No, I enjoyed it, but I saw it ending differently in my head.
Yes, Edward Norton really played a deranged character.
It just made me feel bad to know that I pulled for him the whole movie, and then he let me down.
I think Richard Gere was kind of boring in it too.
Yeah, he didn't have a lot of excitement, but I think it was just because Edward Norton stole the show.
It definitely was a good movie though.
I agree with you, but I just wish it had a happier resolution.
