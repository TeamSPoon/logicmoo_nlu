Bill Romanowski is pretty crazy, even by linebacker standards!
I would say he's crazy by any standards!
I hope he's ashamed of himself for punching that one tight end in the eye!
Yeah really.  He ended the guys career with one punch.  People that strong shouldn't punch people, period.
From what I remember, he crushed the guy's eye socket.  It was his own team member too and it happened during a scrimmage.
That's true, he also attacked people who weren't on his team, while playing the game in arenas too.
Yeah, from what I remember he punched a guy, he kicked a guy in the head and he banged helmets with someone.
That's true.  Kerry Collins was the quarterback of the Carolina Panthers, and it broke his jaw!
Yeah, I just looked it up and he was fined $20,000.
That's good. Marcus Williams is the teammate whose eye socket he crushed with the punch.
Yeah, he sued him and claimed that he was on steroids and that's what made him so aggressive.
Well that totally reminds me that he was involved with BALCO labs and the whole scandal.
Really?  I didn't know that.
Yes it's true.  He was totally on steroids, "the clear" and "the cream".
Wow, same as Barry Bonds and those other guys.
Yep.  He was always really big on a lot of different things to keep himself in top shape.
That I knew.  For some reason I didn't know he was on all sorts of steroids.
Well he was.  They were designer staroids.
Amazing.  He just left no stone unturned in his quest to be the best athlete he could.
That's true, but it's too bad he was a slapper of people.
