What did you think about that Wizards game last night?
Nice to finally get a competitive game in that series.
Yeah but I wish John Wall had hit a regular shot at the end instead of a three-pointer. We could have had overtime.
I'm just glad the Wizards won so we get a seventh game.
Who do you think will win that one?
I think Isaiah Thomas will have a huge performance at home. I see the Celtics taking it.
Don't you think the Wizards could have another huge run like they have been having in every game in this series?
I don't think the Celtics will let that happen at this point. They closed the Bulls out pretty convincingly.
Wizards are a better team than Chicago though.
Yes but Thomas is not as distracted in this series. He might be the best player in the series.
So you think Thomas is better than Wall?
Wall is a better passer. Thomas is a better scorer.
Either one of them can take over a game though. I don't think either is better than the other.
Both of them play better at home. Since this one is in Boston I think Isaiah will be the better player.
Do you think either of them has a chance against Cleveland.
Not a chance! Cleveland is resting while these two are killing each other.
Yeah, and Cleveland was better to begin with. The regular season record doesn't mean much.
Right. Lebron takes it to another level in the playoffs.
So then you think the Finals are set? A rematch between Cleveland and Golden State?
This past year has proven anything is possible so maybe not. But I'd be shocked if you see the Spurs, Wizards or Celtics in the Finals.
