So, I just saw the whole Harry Potter series, again, for the second time.
What did you think the second time round?
There was a lot of deep stuff I missed the first time.
Like what?
Well, for one that Luna can see the ghost horses only those whom have seen death can.
Yep, shows she has seen some awful things.
Then it went on to show her life at home, her dad seemed off.
I think that is what made her complex. She was more than just a kid, she had seen a lot of death and sadness.
But she still kept the sort of sad but happy tone to herself.
I think it was meant to show that even young people can grown from despair, it changes them, but they can still be happy in their selves.
