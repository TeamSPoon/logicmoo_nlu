Hey, have you seen any good movies lately?
I saw the new Fast and Furious movie in theaters last week.
Oh, The Fate of the Furious? How was it?
It was pretty good! But have you seen the others?
Yes, I think I have seen most of the previous ones.
Then you would like it. It references a lot of the other movies.
I'll have to give it a try.
How about you? Have you seen anything good lately?
I saw Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2! It was awesome!
Oh man, I have been dying to see that!
You need to see it in theaters! Make sure you stay through to the end. There are a lot of scenes during the credits.
Thanks for the tip!
Let me know after you've seen it and we can talk more about it. I don't want to spoil anything.
Definitely! I can't wait to see if all of the characters from the last movie are still in it.
I think most of them are! At least all of the ones I care about.
What about Groot?
Yes, he is definitely there but as a baby.
Aww, baby Groot! Must be cute!
You'll have to see for yourself!
I totally will.
