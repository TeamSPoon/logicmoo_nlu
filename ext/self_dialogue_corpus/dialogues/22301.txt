Have you gone to see the new movie Guardians of the Galaxy?
No I haven't.
Did you get to see the first one when it was out?
Well we rented the DVD, it was good.
Yes, I liked that one. I didn't get to see the second one yet either.
I usually wait for rentals.
I like the characters in the movie.
Me too. I like Groot.
Yea, Groot is cute.
I like the previews with the little Groot, it is cuter than the big one.
The fox is a good character too.
Yes, My least favorite character is the green woman. I don't know her name.
I know, not a fan either.
Can't wait to see it though. It has to be as good as the first one.
Yea, and they also have good sountracks.
Yea, I like the use of loder music in movies.
Yes, Hooked on a feeling and Spirit in the Sky, two classics.
I hope the movie has some good ones this time.
I heard Fox on the Run in the trailer for the movie.
Yea, they said it is only for the trailer, not actually in the movie.
