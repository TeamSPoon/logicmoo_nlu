Have you heard of the band The Catherine Wheel?
I'm not sure. What do they sing?
I would say their most famous song is "I Want To Touch You".
Oh, I think I have heard this song. What album is it from?
It is from the 1992 album "Ferment".
Is their music considered "shoegaze"?
Yes, that's what most people call it, but I really think it falls under the Alternative genre, in my opinion.
What other hit songs does The Catherine Wheel have?
I would say their next famous song is "Crank" or "Waydown".
Oh "Waydown"! I have seen that video on MTV before!
I'm sure you have. They were very big on MTV in the late 90's.
That video is cool and the singer is pretty cute.
His name is Rob Dickinson.
Dickinson? Like Bruce Dickinson from Iron Maiden.
Yes. Actually, they are cousins!
Oh, how cool is that!
It is! A musical family!
Aren't they from England?
Yes. They are British!
Cool!
