I finally watched that thriller, Dark Swan.
What did you think of it?
It was much darker than I thought it would be.
Natalie Portman had such a great role in that film.
I loved that it made me wonder about her sanity.
I liked the way it twisted the genre around.
The ballet aspect was so poetic.
I think it was meant to sort of play the story out before the story did.
The title was fitting as well.
I wonder if she will do any more thrillers?
