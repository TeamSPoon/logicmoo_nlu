We watched Finding Dory last week.
Is that the second Finding Nemo movie?
Yes, about Dory's childhood and why she is like she is.
So it explains her life?
Yes. It's a pretty cute movie.
I love Nemo.
Me too. His father Marlin is a funny guy too.
Yes, the three characters go together good.
Keeps you wanting to watch.
Even an adult likes Nemo movies.
