Hey, have you seen the moive Mafia!?
No, what's it about, some real early gangster fillm?
No, it a comedic spoof of gangster movies and it was Llyod Bridges's last film.
Llyod Bridges? Then it was be pretty funny.
Yeah, they spoof the Godfather and the movie Casino.
Okay, how are the jokes and gags?
Well, the Don( Lylod Bridges character) is shot 47 times at his daughter's wedding by a giant disguised as a priest, who say's" Say hello to my little friend:, lift's his cassock and a midget with a machinegun steps out.
Okay, nice Scarface reference, anything else?
Anthony "Tony" Cortino, played by Jay Mohr, the Don's youngest son is blow up by a car bomb and returns disfigured in a parody of "The English Patient"
Okay, this sounds worth a look.
