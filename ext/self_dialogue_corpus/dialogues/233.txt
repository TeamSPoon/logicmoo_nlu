Have you seen the new Wolverine movie?
You mean Logan? No I haven't have you?
No, not yet, but I really want to see it.
Me, too. I'm a huge Hugh Jackman fan!
I am, too! And I love the X-Men!
Oh, me, too! I was into the comics and animated series before the movies started coming out.
So who's your favorite X-Men character?
Wolverine, of course! And that was before Hugh Jackman started playing him.
I think Hugh Jackman is the best as Wolverine.
Yeah, even though he's way taller than the real Wolverine would be.
