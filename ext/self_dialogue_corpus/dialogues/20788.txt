Have you seen Ice Age?
Yeah, I saw it a long time ago.
It came out on 2002.
Why did you bring up that movie?
Oh, I just saw it on TV the other day.
I always liked the movies with full animation.
I believe Pixar made the movie.
It's nice getting away from all the melodrama in movies.
Who was your favorite character?
I like the squirrel.
He had to bury his acorn for the winter.
Yeah, he needed to store food for the spring.
Most animals usually do that.
The movie wasn't a wildlife documentary.
I know they added alot of humor to it.
Do you know who voiced the mammoth?
Yeah, Ray Romano did the voicing.
Wow, I didn't expect him to do that.
The mammoth added a nice touch to the movie.
Yeah, I certainly agree to that. He was a good character.
