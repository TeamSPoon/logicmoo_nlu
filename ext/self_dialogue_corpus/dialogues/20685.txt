Do you know Ana Lily Amirpour?
No, I've never heard of her. Who is she?
She is a director.
Oh? What did she do?
She directed The Bad Batch, in her latest film.
Was it any good?
I don't know, I didn't see it. I think it's online somewhere.
I might watch that later. Who does it star?
Suki Waterhouse, Jason Momoa, and Giovanni Ribisi are in the film.
What reviews did it receive from critics?
Mostly bad. It has a 43% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes.
Is that a good score?
I would think not. It's below fifty percent.
I'm sorry to hear that critics didn't like it.
Yes, that's critics job I suppose.
I guess you're right.
Where do you read movie reviews at?
I read them at The Seattle Times website.
That sounds really cool actually.
It is.
