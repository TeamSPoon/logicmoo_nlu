Do you want to go out Saturday night and hang out in a club or something?
Sure, have you been to that bar on Central Ave called Mickey's? They play really great rock songs, and have several pool tables.
I've drove past it, but I haven't been in there. What kind of music do they play?
I was there a couple weeks ago, and they were playing Metallica, Coldplay, Van Halen, 3 Doors Down, a whole mix of cool rock.
That sounds really good, I love Metallica but I don't hear it too often any more.
I miss 90s rock, it was the best. They used to play Metallica on the radio every day, now they never play it.
Most clubs these days play electronic dance or rap, and I wind up with a headache.
I know what you mean. That stuff gives me a headache too.
It's funny how you can listen to a band like Metallica really loud though and it doesn't give you a headache.
Right?! We should go hang out there this weekend then.
