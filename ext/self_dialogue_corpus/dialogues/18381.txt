Have you heard Slowdive's new album?
No, I thought they stopped making music after the '90s.
Yup! It's their first album since Pygmalion, which was in 1995.
Oh, I loved that album, although my favorite is Souvlaki. What's the new one called?
It's self-titled.
Do you like it?
Surprisingly, yeah. I'm usually skeptical when a band comes together after a long break like that.
What did you think of My Bloody Valentine's 2013 album?
I hated it.
I thought it was okay. It's self-titled too, right?
Yeah, I think it's called MBV.
Loveless will always be the best shoegaze album to exist.
Really? I personally like Isn't Anything a lot better.
Isn't Anything is good, but Loveless means a lot to me.
What's your favorite song on the album?
Definitely "I Only Said".
Nice, I really like that song too. Aren't they from the UK?
No, I think they're Irish.
Oh, I thought all shoegaze from back then was British.
I thought so too for a while! Even Slowdive is English.
