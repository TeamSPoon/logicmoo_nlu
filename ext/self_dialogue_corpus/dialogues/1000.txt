Who do you think will win the Super Bowl this season?
I like the Cowboy's
Really? I think Dak and Zeke will have the Sophmore slump
Nah. Cowboys have a great Offensive Line and the sophmore slump is a myth.
I like the Patriots
Yeah, can't bet against Belicheck and Brady
Brady really is timeless, it is amazing
I think they will win the AFC for sure.
Who is your dark horse pick?
I'm thinking the Jags.
What? you're crazy, why?
I like the rookie Fournette, and I think Bortles takes a big leap forward
Come one. Bortles has shown he is mediocre at best. I do like Fournette he was a beast at LSU
Yeah, who is your dark horse?
I like Cam and the Panthers to bounce back
Hm. Seems like a solid pick.
Yeah, I think last season was just a one off
I worry about Cam getting injured
Me too, but he is versatle
Yup, he can beat you with his arm or his feet
