What was the last Disney movie you saw?
Does Star Wars count?
Nah, let's say classic Disney animated movies only.
Hmmm, Frozen if you're going by the strict definition.
What do you mean by strict definition?
Well, if I google a list, Wikipedia gives me all sorts of Disney and Disney affiliated movies.
Yeah, like what?
Well, there's Zootopia, which was Disney but no princess. Plus Disney acquired Pixar so there's Finding Dory and the like.
Oh, and they own Marvel now too!
Yeah, hopefully we'll have some better female centric Marvel movies now that DC has raised the bar with Wonder Woman.
