what is your favorite comedy movie?
Without a doubt Happy Gilmore.
I agree, Adam Sandler was fantastic in the movie.
He was indeed. Many great lines and scenes
Which did you like best?
I think when Bob Barker was his playing partner in the Pro-Am
Yeah, when Barker got so mad at Happy for playing so poorly they got in a fight.
Do you remember who one the fight?
Of course, BArker faked like he was knocked out and then shocked Happy and pounded him into submission. Hilarious.
The PGA commissioner then attempted to kick Happy off the tour.
