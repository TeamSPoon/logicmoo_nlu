Did you ever get a chance to see Florence Foster Jenkins?
No, but I think it's on Amazon now. Should I watch it?
Yeah, I liked it. It's both funny and sad.
I've seen the previews. How terrible is Florence's singing?
Incredibly terrible. It's impressive that Meryl Streep can sing that badly on purpose.
Wow. And this is based on a true story?
It is. Apparently the real Lady Florence was equally terrible at singing.
So it's a comedy?
Kind of. The singing is funny, but the story is more serious.
How so?
Her husband is trying to protect her from finding out she's a terrible singer.
Aww, that's kind of sweet.
He loves her even though she's ill and they can't be together as husband and wife.
So he's trying to make her think she's actually great?
Yep. He gets all their friends to help.
So what happens after that?
Eventually she wants to give a public concert, and that's a big problem.
I see that, if she can't sing!
But it's really a sweet movie about what people do for love.
I'll have to check it out!
