What was the name of the girl in Peter Pan?
You must be talking about Wendy.
No, the fairy.  Who was the fairy?
Tinkerbell?
Yes, Tinkerbell.  That's who I'm thinking of.
How can you forget Tink?  She's iconic and had about five other movies made of her.
I'm not the Disney aficionado that you are.
I know my Disney.  Even those that don't know Disney know Tinkerbell.
Well, now I've been educated properly.  You must be proud of yourself.
Very proud of myself.  I'm a champ!
