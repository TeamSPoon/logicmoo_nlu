Would you have listened to Lil Dicky if it was for Eminem?
Oh yeah Em broke through
I think that he needs to go back to rapping about women and killing people.
The track Kim was so distrubing
He could paint mental imagery like no other
It just made me feel uncomfortable.
Then he had that song called Drug Ballad.
Yeah and that was all too real as well.
I think thats why people loved him, he rapped about relevant things and painted pictures
Yeah I think thats part of his overall appeal.
