What is your favorite part in Return of the Jedi?
I liked the scenes with Darth Sidious.
Those were good.
Did you know they had a different actor play the part in Empire?
Oh really?
Yes, but it was changed twice. Once to the guy from Return of the Jedi.
What did the original emperor look like?
He had a strange eye and a different voice.
Very cool.
Yes, you should check it out.
