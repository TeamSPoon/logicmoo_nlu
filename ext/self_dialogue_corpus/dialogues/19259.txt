Are you a fan of progressive metal?
That has to be my favorite style of metal. It has the most sophisticated songwriting.
Who's your favorite artist or band in that style?
Definitely Dream Theater. You just can't talk about prog without bringing them up.
Hard to argue with that. They pretty much revolutionized it.
Absolutely. Octavarium is still one of my all time favorite albums.
You have great taste in prog metal!
Thanks. So what's your favorite band?
It's actually not a band, but a single artist.
Don't think I've ever heard of any prog soloists. Who is it?
He's a guy by the name of Devin Townsend.
The name sounds familiar. Has he been in other bands?
Actually yes. He was most famously the frontman of Strapping Young Lad.
That's where I remember him from/ I didn't know he did solo music.
Well, he does! His solo project is called The Devin Townsend Project, and his music is incredible.
Do they have any recent stuff I could check out?
Yes. They released an album called Transcendence just last year.
Alright. What can I look forward to?
It has very complex time signatures, very melodic guitars, and very atmospheric vocals and effects.
I like it already.
