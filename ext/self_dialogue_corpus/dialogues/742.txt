Hard to believe football starts in less than two months.
It comes up quickly.
It seems like yesterday I was,watching the SUPERBOWL.
I hear you there.
What do you think of the packers chances of making the SUPERBOWL.
As long as they have Aaron Rodgers anything is possible.
He's something else isn't he?
That's putting it mildly.
I've never seen a quarterback throw so many successful Hail Mary passses in my life.
I know,usually if you do it once in your career it's good.
He's done,it several times already.
Everyone of them were in a huge game.
How is there schedule this year?
They've got some tough games.
Who do they open with?
They open at home with the Seahawks.
That'll be a good game.
They also have the falcons away,the Cowboys away,the steelers away and the saints at home.
That's not an easy schedule.
No it's not
