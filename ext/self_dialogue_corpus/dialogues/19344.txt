What is your favorite type of music?
That's hard to answer. I like all kinds.
Well, me too. If you had to choose.
People would laugh at me, but I like Pop the most.
Yeah, that's up rthere for me too. Right next to rock.
It's a tie for me too.
Have you heard the new Harry Styles song?
Yes, I love it.
My husband even likes it.
Mr. rock and roll.
Yeah, but he likes all types too. Rock is definitely his favorite though.
At least he has an open mind.
Harry Styles solo CD is pretty good.
He does have a great voice.
Yes, sometimes he sounds like singers from the Sinatra days.
Yes he does.
I wonder if One Direction is completely done now.
I don't know.
Some of the other guys are doing solo albums too.
Well they are talented.
