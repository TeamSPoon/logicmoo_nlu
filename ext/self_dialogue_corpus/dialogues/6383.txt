What is your favorite Disney song?
"Under the sea" from The Little Mermaid.
Oh I forgot about that one!
How could you forget about it? Sebastian is the best.
He's pretty great, although I think Flounder was my favorite character.
Flounder was pretty cute. I had a stuffed flounder doll when I was a little girl.
Me too! I slept with that thing all the time. I thought he would help me ward off Ursula.
Ursula was so creepy.
Yea and those ells that she had were gross too.
I actually thought they were kind of cute.
