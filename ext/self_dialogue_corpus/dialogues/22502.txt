Leigh looks really old in the movie.
She's 55 in real life, right?
I don't know, but she looked like she was 60 or so in the movie.
What I mean is that it''s only shocking because you're used to seeing her with makeup which makes her look younger.
Maybe, but it is not just how old she looks- she is really rugged. I think she is playing some sort of frontier woman.
Okay, looking old and looking rugged are two different things.
Yeah, and it did not help that she is constantly being punched in the face and assaulted during the movie.
That sounds really hideous. She is just abused constantly throughout the movie?
I don't think abused is the right word.
But you said they are hitting her in the face consonantly, right?
Yes, but she is a murderer, and a vile person throughout the movie.
I don't know. I would not feel comfortable sitting in a theater watching people hit a woman over...wait, people? Multiple people are doing it?
I keep trying to tell you that she is a horrible person. Whoever she comes into contact with cannot stand her.
And the people who are hitting her are the good guys?
That is why they call them protagonists and antagonists. But yeah, they are the "good guys." They are not murderers like her. They work to uphold the law.
Would they be working to uphold the law if they were not getting paid for it?
I can say for a fact that the Hangman, Kurt Russel seems to enjoy brining people to justice and making them pay for their crimes.
Beating a female prisoner does not sound like justice.
I think the best I can say is that the movie was set in a different time period and that the Hangman could not show any sort of weakness. If she had been a man, he would have been hitting a man- the fact he treats a woman so bad is addressed a few times.
But no one actually does anything about it, right?
