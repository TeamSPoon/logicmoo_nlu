Did you know Harrison Ford originally wasn't going to be in the series?
You mean he wasn't first choice for Han Solo?
Apparently, they wanted Burt Reynolds to be the guy.
That's just crazy to think about.  Who else was under consideration?
Al Pacino, Jack Nicholson, even Christopher Walken.
Now that would have been something to seen Walken do it.
It's hard to imagine anyone being Han except Ford.
Arguably his most iconic screen character.
He made a wise financial decision, that's for sure.
Does he get royalties?  If so, my goodness, he must be loaded.
