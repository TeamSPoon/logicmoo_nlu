The first time I saw Up I was full of such emotion.
Oh I know because you didn't know what to expect.
At first I was happy and laughing for the first bit.
Sure and then you start to see the plot develop.
And before you know it you are crying. I don't think I made it through the first 10 minutes without crying.
It was so sad when the wife died. I cried too.
It was awesome though when the balloons start to rise up from the house.
Yeah, and the nurses from the old age home just stare in amazement as it floats away.
It had a great ending. I really liked that Carl learned to get over his sadness and became an important part in Russell's life.
Yes, Carl became like a grandfather for Russell who needed a good father figure.
