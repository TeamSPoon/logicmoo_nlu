Don McLean's popular song "The Day the Music Died" suggests that pop music could abruptly end. Is this possible?
I don't think so. It's hard to imagine.
Why? Things change quickly.
It seems to me that there will always be music made. And, some of this music will be more popular than others.
Yes, pop music has many admirable qualities.
I agree. It even affects international relations and events.
How so? I thought pop music was shallow and meaningless.
Each nation takes great pride in its music. They show it off at world events such as the Olympics.
That's true. The Irish, for example, are very proud of their Celtic music.
Yes. It's interesting when a type of pop music can become well-known in multiple locations.
