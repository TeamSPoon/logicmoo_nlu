Who is your favorite Star Wars villain?
That would be Darth Vader.
Why Darth Vader?
I think he did a great job at being a bad guy and I loved his loud breathing.
That was rather creepy.
I also like how he turned around in Return of the Jedi and saved Luke's life.
That as a pretty special moment.
It was and I felt bad when he died.
I did, too.
At least he was a good guy when he died.
