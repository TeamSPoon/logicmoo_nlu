What did you think of the new Jurassic World movie.
I thought it was a pretty good movie.
Just pretty good?
Yeah I think it was done well and all but something was missing.
Yeah I think the old actors sold the first original movie.
Plus I just didn't care for the story or setting.
The look was top notch though.
Yeah CGI was very good in this one.
What was your favorite part?
Hard to just pick one.
Try.
Probably the raptor training scenes.
That's interesting why?
I just loved how they were trying to train the raptors and the process, plus I love that actor.
Yeah it was neat and they did succeed.
Didn't the raptors they trained help them in the end.
Yes I believe they did.
That was awesome
I kind of hope they do more.
Yeah if anything for nostalgia sake.
