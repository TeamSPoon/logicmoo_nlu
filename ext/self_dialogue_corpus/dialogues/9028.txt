Have you listened to any good rock bands lately?
I've been listening to Nickelback.
They're one of my favorite bands. Chad Kroeger is a good singer.
He is. Did you know he collaborated with Carlos Santana?
I didn't know that. When did they work together?
Back in 2007, the name of the song was Into the Night?
That's awesome! Has Chad Kroeger worked with any other artists?
He worked with Josey Scott on the song Hero.
Isn't Josey Scott in the band Saliva?
Yes, he's the lead singer of Saliva.
