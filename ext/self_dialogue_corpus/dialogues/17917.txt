Do you like Indie type rap?
Do you mean like stuff that isn't all the same thing about money and women?
Yeah, like do you think you would like Atmosphere?
What kind of songs do they have?
My favorite album is called God Loves Ugly.
Wow, that's a great name for an album. When was it made?
It's kind of old. It was made in 2002, but I think the music is really great, kind of timeless if you like their style.
Is there more than one person in this group?
Yeah, but the singer is Slug. He has a great voice and his lyrics are unique.
It sounds like something I might like.  I'm kind of tired of the same old "bling" and put women down kind of stuff.
If you want to check out the group, you can just do a search on YouTube and find plenty of samples.
Great, I'll do that. It sounds like I might have something new to listen to now!
Some of the songs are kind of weird, so I'd recommend starting with something like God Loves Ugly or One of a Kind.
Those are the older ones, right?
Yeah, I am pretty partial to the God Loves Ugly album, ha ha.
Is the band still around?
They released new songs last year, but I haven't really listened to those. Definitely still around.
I am going to check out some of the music now. Thanks!
No problem. I think you'll really get a kick out of some of the lyrics too.
Okay, I'll talk to you later.
