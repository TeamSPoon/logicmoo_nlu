Would you shorten the regular season?
Yeah probably by about 20 games.
Why that many?
I think you need to end baseball by mid October.
It does go on far too long
Yeah start the playoffs around Labor Day.
That would be significant, you would have to change the trade deadline.
I just think for the amount of games played and playoff teams, its not needed.
What about the lost revenues?
Teams can change their business model and figure it out.
Maybe expand the playoffs?
If you do that then you are really negating the regular season
So how do you assume you can make the game better?
Well I am not trying to improve the game, just eliminate games we dont need.
People could argue that final weekend is important.
It can and could be but you gotta assume that theyd be just important early on.
I think they should expand benches.
Just hitters?
Yeah, teams should be able to carry 3 catchers.
Your logic is a bit flawed to be honest.
