Hey Marty, what are you doing?
Oh, hey Doc, I'm about to plug my guitar into this giant amp!
Hmmm...I think there's something wrong with that amp, you should try this smaller one here.
Ok Doc, I will do that.  Want to hear what I've been practicing?
Sure, Marty, what is it?
It's the Power of Love by Huey Lewis and the News.
I love that song.  That was the band's first number one song!
I didn't know that.  You seem to know a lot about Huey Lewis and the News.
I sure do, they are my favorite band!
Cool, do you know any Huey Lewis Trivia?
Well, Marty, let me think.  Did you know that they were originally called Huey Lewis and the American Express, but had to change their name because of the credit card company?
I didn't know that...that's interesting.  I do know that Huey has a cameo in Back to the Future!
He sure does!  He has two songs in the movie.  The Power of Love, and Back in Time.
Nice, what else do you know about the band?
During the 80s and 90s they had 19 top ten hits!
That's quite a few, they must have been really popular.
They sure were, they were even nominated for an Academy Award for Power of Love.
I didn't know that!  Did they win?
No, they were beaten out by "Say You, Say Me"  by Lionel Richie.
That's too bad, but you know, it was an honor for them to be nominated!
