Whos your under-dog team this year?
The Dolphins, hands down
will we see another Peyton Manning?
No, that man was a legend
If you had the money, what team would you buy?
Easy, New England Patriots
Why are The Bengals uniforms so ugly?
I don't know, it hurts my eyes too.
I have a hard time crowning any QB of this era as "GOAT"
Good thing my pick doesn't need a crown. Only a helmet, pads and a football.
Don't get me wrong marino Montana and fouts are great and all but I have a hard time saying any of these guys are the GOAT. Could you imagine Johnny Unitas playing in a West coast offense? Joe Namath playing in the air coryell? Otto Graham playing after the Mel Blount rule? You can't touch recievers anymore
I don't think you can really put a value on "taking a pounding."
The reason why time of possession is important is to let your defense rest and plan to attack the offense. Defenses tire faster because they move reactively which takes more burst energy and more oxygen.
Yea. Teams want to play games that feature fewer total possessions against elite qb's
The 2018 NFL Hall of Fame Class may be one of the most Competitive
I don't think Tagliabue is going to get the contributor nod this year. The fact that he wasn't voted in last year after getting it was very telling. It'll be a while before they try that again.
What are your expectations for Jamaal Charles?
If Charles is 90% of what he was in KC and healthy, he turns CJ into a short yardage / goal line back.  But sadly I think he's out of gas. Would love to be wrong on this.
Poor Browns fans and their players it must be hard to watch recently knowing you're almost definitely going to be laughed at come the end of the season.
On a long enough timeline, the success rate for every NFL team rises to 100%. So yes.
