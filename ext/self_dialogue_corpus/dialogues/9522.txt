Do you think Lil Kim was a good rapper?
She was not that bad but she was aided by Biggie
Yeah I think you are right on that one
I liked Eve better.
Where was she from?
Philly if I recall correctly.
Yeah I think you are right, she did alot of collabs with other artists.
Yeah she was featured in some Ja Rule tracks that blew her up
She stood out on her own as well
I think she was a pretty solid performer and would achieve success on her own. Her lyrics were good for women.
