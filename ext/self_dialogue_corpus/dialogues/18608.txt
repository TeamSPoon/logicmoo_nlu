The way we listen to music these days has changed so much.
How so?
I remember when I was younger, I'd save up and buy CDs.
Yeah, that's true. But that's not much different.
Yes it is. For example, I didn't know what any of the songs sounded like!
Why not?
Well, unless they played on the radio and I caught them, getting a CD was like a blind grab bag.
Oh, I guess that's true. I've kind of not thought about it.
Nowadays we can listen to music online for free. For example, on YouTube.
Yeah, the people on YouTube get paid by ad revenue. So it's free music.
I guess that part is kind of like the radio, but you can look up what you want to hear, when you want to hear it.
Yes, you get to listen to exactly what you want to listen to.
Another thing that's different is that, if you don't like all the music, you can just buy specific songs.
For about 99 cents each or so. And you download them.
Yeah, I've got to say I'm not keen on that. I like having hard copies, like CDs.
Young people would probably have no clue what we're talking about!
Yes, they have it so easy now with getting to listen for free online. And maybe never spend a cent on music.
They could just listen to it for free, legally, all day.
Now do you see my point about how things have changed?
I sure do. But it makes me nostalgic, and now I want to go out and buy a CD!
