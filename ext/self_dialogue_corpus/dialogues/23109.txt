Have you seen The Force Awakens?
Of course.
Okay, I know a lot of fans are unhappy, but what did you think?
I think it definitely could have been more original - I mean, it was a structural replica of Episode IV - but in itself as a film, it was pretty good.
That's what I thought. It could have been better but it was still enjoyable.
Some people aren't feeling the nostalgia. I actually liked it a lot, and that was partially because of all the feeling flooding back from all the other movies
I know what you mean. When they find the Millenium Falcon?
I almost cried but I figured I should save my tears for later
And you were right.
I kind of wish I hadn't been
When Han fell and Leia felt it?
That hit me hard. And think about it, Luke had a similar connection to Han and was Leia's twin, so he probably felt it too.
I hadn't thought of that. That's pretty cool.
There's so much to unpack about it. I feel like a lot of people didn't give it a chance.
The internet was annoyed because Rey was so good at everything for no reason, but Luke was annoyingly good at everything his first try too
Well that's the thing, it's not Rey's first time. She grew up as a slave salvaging mechanic parts so it makes sense that somewhere along the way she learned some engineering
You're right. It completely made sense for her to have some experience. Luke just sat home his whole life with his aunt and uncle
Speaking of Luke, I'm stoked for the next movie.
Me too! That was a pretty great cliffhanger.
I agree. She was just about to hand him the lightsaber and then the credits rolled.
