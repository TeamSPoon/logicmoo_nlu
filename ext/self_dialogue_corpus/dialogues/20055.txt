What do you consider to be the best movie of all time?
Wow, that's a tough one. But I'd have to choose Taxi Driver.
Really? And why that film?
It's pulp story told in the most beautiful way.
I always thought it was overly violent.
Well, the beauty is in the violence. It's in the grit of the city and the pain of the characters.
What do you mean?
It's a brutal look into the mind of a man who is not quite right, in a city that's not quite right.
Did you David Hinkley, the guy who shot Reagan was obsessed with Jodie Foster in that movie?
I've heard that.
He actually tried to find her at the time, but couldn't get close enough to her...
So instead he tried to kill the president, to impress her.
The way Travis does in Taxi Driver.
Crazy. The movie has some other great characters as well. Albert Brooks... Peter Boyle.
I read that the guy who sells Travis all the weapons was actually a bit of a drug dealer at the time, so that's why he's so realisitic.
So what do you think about the end? Do you think he actually did all those things?
No, I think it's all what he HOPED would happen. I think he either died or is jail.
Yeah, that's what I think too. The now from Iris's parents at the end is written in Travis's handwriting, so it makes you think it's something he's created.
And, of course, there's the famous "you talking to me?" scene. One of my favorites.
Agreed. It's one of the most iconic scenes in cinema.
