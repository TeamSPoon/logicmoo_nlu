Paul Walker was so cute in Fast and Furious.
I like Vin Diesel better.
How many movies have they made now?
I don't know maybe like 8. Furious 8 I think is what they were working on when Paul Walker died.
I thought it was neat how they still kept him in the film
Yes, it was. Did I hear his brother was a stand in for some of the stuff that hadn't been filmed yet?
I'm not sure about that.
Me either, I sure hate to see it end though
Well I heard Liam Nesson was going to be in the next one.
That might be an interesting character change
