I can't believe the Marlins are still so bad this year.
I can.
Why's that?
The death of Fernandez really messed up that franchise. Their pitching is terrible.
Yeah, but the hitters aren't hitting either.
I guess. Stanton is batting what, .250?
I hate to say it, but he's extremely overrated. That contract...
Finally the Marlins spend monoey and the player doesn't live up to it.
He's making 1 million per strike out. Haha!
Ouch. And what happened to Yelich? He was so good in the World Baseball Classic.
I don't know. His batting average is just as low as Stanton's. It's a shame.
That team has been together for a while too. You would think it would click eventually.
The players aren't bad but the combination doesn't work. No one is hitting.
Who else is struggling?
Bour, Gordan, even Ichiro.
They may have to hire a new batting coach. What happened to Barry Bonds?
He's gone. The only one who learned anything from him was Ozuna.
He's doing real good, right? Probably the only all-star for them this year.
Yup. Oh well, hope they win tonight.
Game starts in 15 minutes. We'll find out soon.
