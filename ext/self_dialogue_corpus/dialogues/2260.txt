The past few superbowls have been kind of uninteresting
I agree. I don't care about any of the teams
I loved when the Saints won in 2009
Oh my god. That was such a good game too
They were underdogs for sure
Coach Payton really gave the city a gift with that win.
It was also fun to watch the Baltimore superbowl that happened in the superdome
The one where Beyonce performed at the halftime show?
Yes, and then the lights went out for a few minutes?
That was so New Orleans.
I hope an underdog team makes it to the superbowl this year
Like who?
The Panthers haven't been in awhile
True. what about the cleveland browns
they might not win a single game this year
I feel the same way about the Rams
Remember when the Lions had all those losing seasons
Yep, they're pretty alright now though
You never know what a team will do
We'll see this season who shakes it up.
