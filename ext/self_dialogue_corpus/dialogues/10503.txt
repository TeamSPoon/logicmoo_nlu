Any parallels in music or movies for you?
What do you mean?
Like, criteria that makes you like something.
That applies to both music and movies?
Sure. What's the "catch" for you personally?
Themes, tone, and overall honesty of the work.
Any examples?
Sure. I'd say that Paul Thomas Anderson seems to have control over his work creativey, amongst other things.
What about the other stuff you mentioned?
He's a good example. His humor can be broad, sometimes dark. I like that about him.
What else?
His stuff has a lot of depth emotionally, and he's good with ensembles that work together.
Where does the parallel with music come in?
I like bands that have themes like what I mentioned, and even some of those like, say, Morrissey, have a sense of humor.
I see. He can be cheeky despite the overall gloominess.
It's like one of those satires like Office Space. They're making fun of something, but something that's really frustrating for many if not most people.
Right. Even something more outlandish within pop music can be that way, as well.
Exactly! Jobs like that suck, but they point it out so cleverly on so many levels. Bands have done that for more than a few decades.
With varying tones, too. It can be fascinating.
Yeah. Must be an endless supply of lyrics about these topics at this point.
