Any good sports films come out lately?
Not that I can remember in the last couple of years.
I think that era in Hollywood has passed.
I just dont think anything captivating has happened in sports to warrant a movie.
Yeah but studios can turn mountains out of mole hills.
Some drama cant even be manufactured if you think about it.
Well outside of that, what do you think the next sports movie would be.
Maybe about the Patriots dynasty.
That sounds more like a documentary.
True, I guess nothing.
Well we know Kurt Russell will probably star in it.
I dont think thats accurate.
Did you like Miracle?
I did, I actually saw it in real life.
You were at the game?
No I watched it on TV.
The movie was pretty spot on.
Yeah it was I just dont know how much behind the scenes stuff is true.
Well it is a film, they have to spice it up.
Guess you could call Hollywood fake news sometimes.
