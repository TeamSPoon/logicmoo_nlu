Hey have your heard about the latest StarBomb album?
Player Select? ya but i haven't listened to it yet.
Don't hold your breath for anything earth shattering like the first one.
Was it disappointing?
Not really, but aside from about two good new songs and some continuations of some music from the first album it was average.
Maybe i wont buy it then.
Its still better than any other indie video game parody music out there.
your probably right
Dan's vocals really shine through in this album too.
Cool, you can tell he is getting better in the NSP albums
I got the physical CD so if you want to barrow it and see if you like it let me know.
Great, i think i will take you up on that.
Oh, they also hinted at a 3rd album.
really. was it subtle or was it Danny, Brian and Aaron style?
No it was very obvious, pretty much said number three is in the works.
Well that's good news for you since you really like the band.
Ya i am looking forward it it but i am a little leery.
Afraid the quality will slip like from album one to album 2 and that you wont like number three.
Nailed it.
Well lets hope the guys surprise you, you have been following them for over 5 years and you know they can still do quality work.
