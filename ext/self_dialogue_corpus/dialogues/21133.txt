I can't wait for the summer movie season to begin.
I think it already has.
I meant, I'm waiting for the real big movies.
What, Guardians of the Galaxy 2 doesn't count?
I guess it does. You're right, the summer movie season has begun.
Definitely. When King Arthur bombed I knew it had officially begun.
Haha. But I heard from a friend that it's really good, actually.
Rotten Tomatoes disagrees, but maybe you can see for yourself when it hits Netflix or whatever.
Maybe. I'm actually sort of looking forward to the new Pirates of the Caribbean movie.
Have you seen the last one?
No, I actually don't know what's going on in the series anymore. But for some reason I want to see the new one.
Guess you'd better catch up on them, then.
Well, I don't know when I'll see it. Someday, but probably not in theaters.
Is there anything you will see in theaters?
Well, I'd like to see the new Transformers movie, but I'll wait on that too.
You haven't answered my question.
Okay, well, I might see The Hitman's Bodyguard in theaters. I think it'll come down to reviews.
Do reviews really matter that much? You wanted to see King Arthur even though it got bad reviews.
That's true, but seeing a movie in the theater is a different experience. I'd like to see a good movie if I go.
I understand. It costs more, so you want to get the best value and experience you can.
