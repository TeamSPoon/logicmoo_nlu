So Spurs and Warriors and in the Conference Finals.
Yeah, I hope it is a good series.
It would be nice to see the Warriors tested.
I'd like to see the Spurs pull it out.
I don't think they can.
It will be tough, especially with Parker hurt.
Yeah, I wonder how much he will play.
If at all.
Well at least Leonard should be back.
Yeah they Spurs really need him.
They didn't need him in the last game against the Rockets.
Well that is because the Rockets didn't show up.
Well at least Harden did show up.
Yeah that was crazy, he did not play well.
At all.
It gave Leonard a chance to rest up and heal.
He will need it.
I know the Warriors are going to be at full strength.
Hopefully, I'd like to see Kerr back on the sideline.
I think Pop would like to see that too.
