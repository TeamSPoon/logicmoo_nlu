Do you like  gory movies?
Like horror gory or just slasher films?
No I am talking about Tarantino-esque movies
Oh, no I do not see the point of it.
Me neither, there is no appeal to them.
They do quite well so we may be in the minority.
I think there is no point in having them in these movies.
I would move away from it as well but I could see why they do well.
Whys that?
People love to see that dramatic part of stuff.
Its not needed in these films.
How do you feel about horror movies using it?
Its important to show how vile some of the villains are.
Yeah I would probably say you are right.
But even then some of it can be brought back,
I like the mind suspense ones better anyway.
Thats really my point, people can make a movie without needing a ton of blood.
I like the psychological thrillers that just really move you as far as being scared.
Yeah seeing blood doesnt make me scared just pissed off sometimes.
There hasnt been a ton of those types released lately
