Who would you say are some of the earliest "legends" and "forefathers" of rap?
I think definitely artists like Dr Dre, Ice T, Flava Flav, and Run DMC.
I can tell you are young, because even though these are all great, I was talking about artists even before their time. Pioneers
I may be young, but I know rap music. If you're talking about real pioneers, I'd have to say Grandmaster Flash and Jazzy Jay.
I'm impressed!
I'm not done yet. I didn't get a chance to mention the Sugarhill Gang. Their classic song in the late 70's "Rapper's Delight" really showed the growth of the genre and introduction of scratching.
As a DJ, that song as well as "The Breaks" by Kurtis Blow really introduced that to me and changed the way I DJ'd
Rakim is another one of my favorite legends.
As a female DJ, I have to say one of my favorites was Sha Rock. I think she was one of the earliest female MCs in the game.
She might have been the actual first one to be that popular at least.
