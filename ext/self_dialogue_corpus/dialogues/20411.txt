Have you seen Finding Dory?
No! I have been meaning to though, how is it?
It is really good. The hype is real.
Tell me about it. How is it related to Finding Nemo?
Well it basically just focuses on Dory, from Finding Nemo, and how she is trying to locate her parents.
That sounds interesting. It is on my to-do list.
What other animated films are you a big fan of?
I really loved Toy Story.
Me too! Which one is your favorite?
I really like the last one that came out. Was that the third one?
Yes, I like it too.
I loved how Andy went away to college. I felt like I really grew up with him.
Are there going to be any more Toy Story movies?
Yes! Toy Story 4 will come out in 2019.
Oh boy, that is exciting! What is it about?
I think Buzz and Woody go out to find Little Bo Peep.
That sounds awesome. I can't wait.
Me either. Inside Out is another good animated movie.
I've heard that it is good. Isn't Mindy Kaling in it?
Yes! She and Amy Poehler both have voice roles.
