What's your favorite album?
I would have to say Thriller by Michael Jackson. It's an amazing classic.
Is Thriller your favorite Michael Jackson song?
Surprisingly, no. I would actually have to say Smooth Criminal is my favorite Michael Jackson song.
Is Smooth Criminal's music video your favorite Michael Jackson video as well?
Yes. While Thriller is an amazing video, I find Smooth Criminal has better dancing and aesthetics than Thriller.
Are you a fan of the 80's pop genre as a whole?
Yeah, there's a lot of great pop music from the 80s, even if there's also a lot of goofy stuff.
Which decade do you think had the best pop music?
I would have to say the 80's. The 90's had catchier stuff, but the 80's had more heart.
What songs are the catchiest 90's songs to you?
There's a lot to choose from, but probably Love fool, Poison, One week, whatta man and All star to name a few.
What do you think about the pop music of today?
I think it's not nearly as bad as it was 10 years ago, and we're finally getting back into more heartfelt and high quality songs over the club music we've had to endure.
You don't find any merit to club music?
Well, it can certainly be great to dance to, but unless you're a person who frequents a club, these songs have no further value. Plus, a lot of them instill bad behaviors like drinking and drugs.
What do you think of Bruno Mars?
I used to think he was another overrated pop singer, but he's gotten a lot more interesting in reviving classic funk.
What's your favorite Bruno Mars song?
It would definitely be Uptown Funk. It's impossible to listen to that song without dancing and singing along.
