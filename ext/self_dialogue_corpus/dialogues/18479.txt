What are your thoughts on rap music?
I have mixed feelings.
Me too.
What I think is that for some it is an inspiration, but for others it may produce some anxieties.
It is very emotional.
It can be.
What do you think of the character of rap music stars?
Some are good, some have challenges like us all.
Yeah, that's probably true.
They get a hard rap, though.
I imagine a lot of rap stars have had challenges in life.
Yeah, but I think they get in trouble or criticized more.
Probably due to the graphic nature of some of the lyrics.
Probably also due to the language in the music.
I imagine so.
Do you think that the music should be censored?
We have freedom of speech in the United States.
That's true, but does it impact the youth?
Language is expression of feelings and you can't deny them sometimes.
That's true.
