Hey! What's your favorite song on the Billboard music charts right now?
Probably the song, "Airplay" by Gainer.
I've never heard of that song! I wish we could see more pop music on the top charts, though.
Oh, yeah? What type of pop music would you like to see top the charts more?
I was thinking maybe some more Selena Gomez or Demi Lovato.
They're really great musical artists! I've been listening to a lot of their stuff lately.
What's your favorite Demi song?
Definitely Neon Lights, she really brought her A game in that one!
I absolutely love that song. The lyrics along with the music video were both amazing.
I totally agree! And as for Selena, did you hear that she is dating fellow R&B and pop star The Weeknd?
I did hear about that! Imagine if they released a duo together?
Now that is a song I would really love to listen to!
The two of their voices mixed with their unique personalities would create the perfect combination for a great hit.
I bet it would top the charts for sure!
I totally think you're right. They're styles would be perfect for a musical release that would stay at number one for awhile.
I wonder if their record labels would let them collaborate together even?
I'm sure they would. The money that song would rake in would be amazing.
Speaking of R&B artists, what do you think of Bruno Mars' new hits?
I like them, but they're a bit too old fashioned for my taste.
I agree, I liked it better when he had more of a modern edge on his singles.
