Does Britney Spears still make music?
I have no idea.  I haven't heard anything from her lately.
Didn't she do something in Vegas?
Yeah, I think she did a while back.
Is she still there?
I don't think she is, but she might be.
When was her last album?
I want to say in the last five years.
Wow, she's been around for a while, right?
Yeah, I think her first album was in 1999.
That sounds about right.  What was the name of that song?
"Baby, One More Time?"
Yeah, that was it!  Do you remember the video?
Yeah, it was all over MTV.
The schoolgirl outfit became a classic thing.
Yeah, no one will forget that.
No, that's one thing you won't forget about that video.
There were a few other young girl artists that came out at that same time.
Yeah, I remember Christina Aguilera and Mandy Moore.
Yeah, well of those three, Christina is probably the only relavant one.
