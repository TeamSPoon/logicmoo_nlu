What song made you fall in love with hiphop music?
I would have to say Microphone Fiend.
Oh, that's a classic Rakim hit for sure.
I fell in love with the video when i was a kid.
Yeah it was dope, especially the little 7 year old running around rocking the mic.
What song made you a hip-hop lover?
I don't have a particular song but Slick Rick did it for me.
He was a fantastic storyteller wasn't me?
I would have to say Slick Rick and Notorious B.I.G are my top two storyteller emcees.
Would have been cool to hear them both on a song together.
