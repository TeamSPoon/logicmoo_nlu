Who do you think the best teams will be this year?
Of course the Patriots!
Well no doubt but I hope someone can finally beat them this year.
I agree. there are other teams that deserve it.
It would be nice to see someone else win the superbowl.
I agree. I get let down when they always win.
I think that Colt's will do better this year.
Hopefully after losing ryan grigson it helps them.
I agree, Hopefully the new guy hired better people.
I believe in them,
I think the Seahawks will do good.
Of course, they are a very competitive team.
I hope Cam Newton does better.
I do to. It was sad watching him get let down and frustrated.
I think that team will do better.
What team does he play for.
He plays for the Carolina Panthers.
That's right.
I am looking forward to watching this new season.
Me too!
