Do you like any acapella groups?
I don't know any.
My favorite is Pentatonix.
I have never heard of them. Tell me a little bit about them.
There are five members in the group and they are from Arlington Texas.
What kinds of songs do they perform?
They usually do pop arrangements, covers mostly, though there are vocal harmonies and beatboxing as well.
That sounds interesting. Would I know them from anything?
They won the third season of Sing-Off.
Are they on youtube?
Yes, they have the thirteenth most subscribed channel on youtube.
They must be doing well have they won any big awards?
I know they've won three Grammy's.
Do you know the names of the vocalists?
Yea, there are four guys and a girl: Scott Hoying, Mitch Grassi, Avi Kaplan, Kevin Olusola, and Kirstin Maldonado.
Do they have any albums?
Yea they have four albums out: PTX, Vols. 1, 2, 3, and 4.
Awesome, but the big question is what have they done with their fame? Get rich?
I don't know about rich, but during The Sing-Off they went to the home offices of The Trevor Project. Which is a suicide prevention non-profit that help LGBTQ youth.
It is nice to know that some people aren't corrupted by fame and use their platform for good.
