How did you feel about Maleficient?
I dont know it was weird.
Angelina Jolie is a good actor though.
She is but the movie was just not that good.
I agree some of the scenes were bizarre.
I dont think they are lining up a 2nd one.
No and I am not sure they ever looked into it.
She should do a better role.
Has she ever been a voice actor for a Disney film.
Theres no possible way.
