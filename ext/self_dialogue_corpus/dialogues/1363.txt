Can you name me your top five players in the NFL?
That is a very difficult question!
I Know! You are the biggest NFL fan I know so I figured you would be the right person to ask.
Are you talking about five different positions, or what?
It does not matter what position they play. Simply your top five in the league.
I got it, this could take me a while though!
That is fine by me. I am just interested in hearing your picks.
I guess I would start my list off with Arron Rodgers.
Are you going in order by the way?
No, I am not naming them in any particular order.
Rodgers is a great first choice by the way.
My second and third players would be Julio Jones and Von Miller.
I like those picks, both of those guys are dominant at their positions.
Then I would go with Richard Sherman. He is a lock down corner.
Yea, he is the foundation of the Seahawk's defense.
My last pick would probably be Tom Brady.
Even though he is basically forty years old?
Did you see what he just did in the Superbowl last year?
I know, he is amazing to do what he does at his age.
So there you have it, my top five NFL players.
