Whats your favorite sci fi thriller movie?
I would have to say Gravity.
I've never seen that, what is it about?
Its about two people that get lost in space because the station they were on gets destroyed by debris flying around earth.
Wow that sounds pretty intense.
Yes, it is. You should watch it.
Did you enjoy watching it then?
Of course, I love crazy movies about space.
Me too, I'm gonna have to check it out.
Okay, Hope you have fun!
