Hello, how are you doing today?
I am good, just bored out of my mind!
You will not not be that way for long, the NFL is right around the corner!
I know, I am desperate for some football in the worst way!
You are a big Cowboys fan, right?
No way! I have always been a Miami Dolphins fan!
That is right, I just got my wires crossed a little bit.
What team do you cheer for?
I do not have a particular team, I just follow the NFL as a whole.
Do you have any predictions for Miami this year?
Well I feel they have a lot of potential to really climb the ladder this season.
Thanks, I sure hope you are right about that!
Making the playoffs last year was a big step in the right direction for that franchise.
I thought so as well, I just hope this season proves that to be true.
Having Ndamukong Suh has really bolstered the Dolphins' defense.
I know, I was really excited when we got him from the Lions.
He has the reputation of being a dirty player; but he is effective.
I feel that every team needs a guy like that in order to really thrive.
You could be right about that actually.
I feel he is the best defensive tackle in the NFL today.
