I just picked up the greatest hits of CCR, it was just rereleased again.
Who is CCR?
They were a rock group back in the 60s.
What does CCR stand for?
Credence Clearwater Revival
Does that have any meaning?
You know, I'm not sure, I've never heard what it meant.
What kind of music do they play?
Rock, maybe a hint of folk or blues thrown in.
Sounds interesting, do they sound like any other groups out there?
No, they definitely had their own sound. Within seconds of one of their songs starting, you just knew it was them, especially when the lead singer started singing.
Why's that about the lead singer?
He had a very unique, kind of raspy voice that wasn't mistaken for anyone else.
Did they have any hits?
Yes, they had quite a few hits and some of them became iconic songs from the 60s, they really hit a chord with people.
What happened to them?
I don't know there real reasons behind it, but apparently they had a bitter breakup, at least a couple of them were family members and didn't talk to each other for a long time.
That's a shame when that happens. Were any of them successful after the group?
Yes, the lead singer John Fogerty took a number of years off to help raise his children and when they got older, he went back in the studio and recorded a number of hits and I believe the later 80s and into the 90s and had successful concert tours that packed the house.
That sounds really interesting and I will have to look up both CCR and John Fogerty as I'm always looking for some unique music.
