What movies did you see this weekend?
I went to see Cars 3!
Oh really? Is that the one by Pixar?
Yes! I love Pixar and all their animated movies.
I actually heard it was good.  What is it about?
It's about a legend trying to stay at the top of his game amongst the new comers.
That sounds like a great story about determination.
I highly recommend it!
What about Despicable Me 3?
Oh yes! I am so excited to see that!
When does it come out again?
June 30th I believe.  Let's go together!
I am in! I love Gru and the minions!
I agree, him and his wife Lucy is great too!
I don't think I'll ever get tired of those minions.
They are way too cute!
I have the other two movies in the series and I cannot get enough!
I have the minion stuffed animal!
We are so dorky.  I can't wait to meet his brother in this movie.
It will be exciting!
