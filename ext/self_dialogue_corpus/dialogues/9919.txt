How did you like Prodigy?
I really liked his music and his personality.
It was sad that he died today.
Yes, today was a very sad day in hip hop.
I really liked him and his friend Havoc.
Yes, they created a great duo.
I can remember as a child how Mobb Deep just make me love hip hop.
I agree, this was one of the first rap groups that I listened to.
He will be greatly missed by the hip hop community.
Prayers up for him and his family.
