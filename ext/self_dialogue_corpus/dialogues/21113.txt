Have you seen the new movie snatched?
No who is in it?
Goldie Hawn and Amy Schumer.
I love them both! How have I not heard of this film.
No clue. I was hoping to get your opinion. I felt let down by Trainwreck.
Trainwreck was a little disappointing for sure. Still adore schumer though.
I still like her as well. I just don't want to waste money on tickets if snatched is another trainwreck.
Ya. I bet it will be better if it has Goldie Hawn.
True she is like a comedy legend. I love so many of her other films.
Ya private benjamin is great.
I agree. Also Death becomes her is one of my top goldie hawn movie picks.
It is exciting to see her on film again, been forever since she has done a movie.
Too long if you ask me.
For sure. Banger sisters was her last film I think and that was like ten years ago.
I never actually saw it. Did you?
I did see that movie. It was just okay. I think I loved it for the actors in it more than the film making quality.
I can see that. Goldie is just so lovable. You can look past a bad film and just enjoy it for her.
Yes, she has that It factor movies need.
I suppose I will probably like Snatched no matter what!
Probably true, enjoy it!
