Jim Morrison was a really good musician, wasn't he?
Definitely!
The Doors really broke into the scene with his great voice and their psychedlic sound.
That is true.
Their first album was outstanding, Light my Fire was a great song.
Yea, I heard he liked to write a lot of poetry that he used in his songs.
Really, well I guess music is sort of poetry as well.
He wrote a lot about peace and love..
They were a great band with a great sound.
His voice was one of a kind.
Yea they mixed all elements in their music, jazz, rock and the blues.
Sure did.
It really was a shame he died so young.
Yes he was only 27.
Drugs killed a lot of famous musicians of that time and now too.
Yea, Jimi Hendrix, janis Joplin to name a couple.
I love the sixties bands
Me too. The Doors were on Ed Sullivan too.
I remember watching that!
That was a great show for musicians, Ed Sullivan always had a good band on.
