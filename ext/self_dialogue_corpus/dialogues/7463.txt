Have you seem Bambi before?
Oh yes, my mom took me when I was really little.
I saw it on video.
I was really young and got so upset about the fire and Bambi's mother getting killed.
Yeah, that was pretty bad at that age.
I also had a record LP that came with a book and when you heard a tinkling sound you were supposed to turn the page.
What was the point of that?
It was as if the record was telling you the story and the tinkling sound had you follow along with the pictures.
I'll bet that would be a collector's item now.
No doubt, but we sold it at a garage sale years ago.
