I think all of my favorite Disney movies have animals as the main characters.
Really? That's strange. Like which?
Well, when I was a kid I really loved One Hundred and One Dalmatians.
I remember that one clearly too! It has such a great villain.
Yeah. Cruella DeVille is a pretty great name, even.
It's funny to think that it's even set in England.
Disney seems so American to me, it's hard for me to wrap my head around it too.
As a kid I couldn't even really conceptualize it.
I'm glad they picked that setting though. We even had Hugh Laurie play a character in the live action remake!
Now that was a great casting choice!
