Seen any good movies lately?
Yeah I saw La La Land.
How was that?
I really liked it!
Really? Yeah I heard it was good.
It was! It was very deserving of those awards.
Is the music good?
The music was absolutely great!
I love the music as well, because I own the soundtrack.
You are very lucky to have that! I hope to purchase it.
So what other movies do you like?
I saw Baywatch.
With Zac Efron and the Rock?
Yeah.
How was that?
It was not as good as I hoped.
I guess I won't see it then.
Yeah if I were you I would not.
Well it was nice talking to you!
You too!
