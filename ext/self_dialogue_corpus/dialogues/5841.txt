What's your all time favorite Disney movie?
I loved The Little Mermaid.
That's the first Disney movie that I can remember that they really had a new animation method from the films they did before.
Yeah, it didn't look like the old ones at all.
I love the look of the old Disney movies.
What is your favorite Disney movie?
Oh, well my favorite movie, much less Disney, is Alice in Wonderland.  It's the best movie there is.
Well, I guess that's a matter of opinion but I do like that movie a lot too.
It's great.  The Mad Hatter, The Cheshire Cat.  Tweetle Dee and Tweetle Dum.
And lets not forget "off with her head"
