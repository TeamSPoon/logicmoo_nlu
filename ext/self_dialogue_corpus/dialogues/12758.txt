I'm really excited for the new Star Wars movie The Last Jedi.
I think the trailers look good.  I think Disney may be over doing it with Star Wars though.
How do you mean?
Well, they seem to be coming out every year with the trilogy films.
Yeah but the older ones released once a year too until they were done.
They also had Rogue One and they're doing a Han Solo movie.  Its just a lot of Star Wars.  I'm afraid they'll do too much.
I guess you're right.  The prequels were so bad though and I thought The Force Awakens was really good so hopefully they'll continue that.
I thought The Force Awakens was ok.  It was basically a retelling of Episode 4.  The deathstar was just bigger.
I guess I can see that.  I really did like Rey though, as a new jedi she's pretty cool.
She was pretty cool.  I guess we'll just have to see if this one is any good.
