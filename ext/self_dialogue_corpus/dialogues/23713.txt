Have you seen the movie "The Heat"?
Is that the one with Melissa McCarthy and Sandra Bullock?
Yes, have you seen it?  It is hilarious!
Yes, I have.  I agree that it is a funny movie to watch, as is almost anything with Melissa McCarthy.
What is one of your favorite parts?
When officer Mullins (McCarthy) goes on a tirade about her boss and his missing balls!
That is classic, she throws a box of tick tacks at him, and says "Shove those up your scrotum"
What is one of your favorite scenes?
I love when the FBI Agent Sara Ashburn (Bullock) goes to Mullins house with her and they are having a family dinner!
Yes! "Are you or are you not a Nak"
I'm sorry what is a Nak?
Like Johnny Depp in 21 Jump Street... Oh a Nark!
That is classic, but my favorite part is when she says I am special agent... and the lady goes "Special as in retarded?"
"Um, no we do not say that, we say special needs, and no, I have a very high IQ!"
Yes, and the "are you a man or a woman?"
I remember that, she says i'm all female, and he goes really, from the get go?  Hilarious!
My husband gets annoyed saying that the movie is not at all realistic, I try telling him that it is simply a comedy.
Yeah, I am sure there is not much realistic in the movie, but it is always good for a laugh!
Yeah, it is one of those movies I can watch over and over and still laugh!
I agree, I have to rewind some of my favorite scenes sometimes because I am laughing so hard that I start crying!
