Did you listen to ASAP Rocky's newest CD?
Yeah, that came out awhile ago.
I was listening to it again the other day. So many hits on that CD.
For sure, the beats on that cd are insane.
I do feel like he could have cut some of the songs out, though.
Definitely. That CD is long.
It's got 18 tracks on it!
That's a whole lot for a rap album.
There's like 9 of them that are really good, though.
Yeah, it's rare for a rap album to have that many good tracks on it anymore.
