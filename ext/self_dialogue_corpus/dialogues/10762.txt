Do you think the Fast & Furious movie franchise should continue making movies?
No.  I definitely think this series is beyond played out and should cease immediately.
Is there anything you enjoy about the Fast & Furious movies?
There were some elements of the very first movie that I did enjoy, yes.  Mostly the fact that it was new and somewhat exciting.
What is it that you don't like about Fast & Furious?
I really don't like the selection of actors.  Specifically, I'm annoyed by Michelle Rodriguez.
What about Vin Diesel?  Do you enjoy his acting in Fast & Furious?
In Fast & Furious, no.  But, I do enjoy him in other movies like Saving Private Ryan.
Do you think there will be more Fast & Furious movies in the future?
Almost definitely, yes.  I think the fan base of this franchise has very low standards and probably wants more.
