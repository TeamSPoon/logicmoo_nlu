What's up?
Nothing much. Just listening to music.
Cool. What are you listening to?
Blink-182.
Wow, I can't believe you still listen to that kind of music.
What do you mean?
I used to listen to Blink-182 when I was 12 years old. They're so emo.
If you listened to them, doesn't that mean you like them too?
I only used to like it. It's so dumb now.
Why is that?
It totally relates to a specific period of our lives. Like, when we were really young and stupid.
What do you mean?
Blink-182 reminds me of when I used to straightnen my hair and paint my nails black.
I don't see the harm in giving this new stuff a chance. I mean, you did like them at some point.
I guess you're right. What song should I listen to?
"Bored to Death." It's from their newest album, California.
Wow. I can't believe they still make music.
Just listen to it.
I can honestly say this is a humorous attempt at music.
Whatever.
