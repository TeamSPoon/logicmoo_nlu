Did you see the new Beauty and the Best with Emma Watson yet?
I want to but I still waiting for it to come to red box to rent.
Me too.
The trailer of the movie is good and I wonder how much of the original they keep in the movie.
As far as I know they suppose to keep about the same except it's going to be perform by real person.
I heard the new theme song in the music video and it is beautiful.
I heard there are two different version by different singers.
I'm not sure which one I heard.
I am so ready for it to come to Red Box to rent.
If you can't wait, you can always buy the DVD so I could borrow it from you.
