What should we do tonight?
Hey, let's watch Tangled!
Tangled, Tangled... that's the Disney Rapunzel movie, right?
I mean, yes, sort of? But it's a lot more than that. There's a handsome rogue, a heroic horse. An evil witch.
You're describing every Disney movie ever made.
No, this one is different. It's funny and clever, and there's some amazing stuff about healthy parental relationships.
Oh, so the main character isn't an orphan? Maybe this ISN'T a typical Disney movie.
Don't be a jerk. These things are stereotypes because they have emotional resonance. Anyway, I'm telling you, especially with your relationship with your mom, you'd like this movie a lot.
Yeesh. I trust you, I guess. Let's watch Tangled.
Yes! You're going to love it.
