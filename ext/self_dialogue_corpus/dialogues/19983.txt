Remember all those punk rock and alternative type bands from the 90s and early 2000s?
Yes, that was such a fun era.
What was your favorite group?
I don't know.  All the lead singers' voices sort of blend together in memory, but I did like Blink-182.
Ah right, they were pretty awesome.
I still hear their stuff on some of the Sirius XM channels.
Same.  I just heard one of their songs recently.
Which one?
The one that goes, "Where are youuuu?!" as they transition between singers.
Ah, that's "I Miss You."
That one is very catchy.
Agreed.  My favorite is "What's My Age Again?"
That's the quintessential Blink-182 song.
It really is.  I can actually play the riff on the guitar.
I didn't realize you played.  I play the bass.
That's great, we should get together and play sometime.
Song suggestion for us to start: "All the Small Things."
Great suggestion!  Let's do it.
Sounds good.  Can't wait to re-experience that era's music.
Looking forward to it.
