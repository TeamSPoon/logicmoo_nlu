Do you like Jimi Hendrix?
I like what I've heard, from what I can remember anyways.
I think almost all of his music is great.
What are some of the better songs out there?
I like All Along the Watchtower a lot, and the Wind Cries Mary.
I've heard the second one, I remember the name.
I think his style of playing is very tasteful and relaxing to hear.
Sometimes I think it can be a little noisy, but some songs seem to be like that.
Yeah I can understand that. He can be a little noisy sometimes.
I've heard his rendition of the Star Spangled Banner, that one was very noisy.
Yes, that one was. That was kind of part of the charm I think though.
It was a little too noisy for me, it didn't follow the original melody enough.
What do you think of his singing?
I like it a lot, he has a very calm and folksy kind of voice.
Yes, that's pretty much what I think too.
It's soothing to listen to, like listening to a popular TV persona.
It definitely is very gentle on the ears.
It's a shame that he passed away so soon.
Yeah, though it's still a mystery of how he did pass away.
I wonder if they'll ever figure out what happened.
