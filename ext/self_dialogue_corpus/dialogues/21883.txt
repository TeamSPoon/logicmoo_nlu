Whats your favorite Disney movie?
I'd say aladdin.
YES! It was mine too.
The music, the character, they are all great!
I liked how the animations flowed and looked so good.
To me, the story was engaging.
I really liked the voice actors
Gilbert Gottfried who played iago was so good!!!
And of course Genie, he was great!!
The sequels to the movies were good too
Surprisingly yes, I like how they brought Aladdins father into the story
Yupp, and the whole power struggle they had was interesting.
What would you do with a magic genie?
I would wish for riches and a nice fruit salad
Sounds amazing, I would use him to travel the world
I wonder how they thought of the magic carpet?
It is an interesting character all by itself
I would actually wish for that, to be able to fly around on a piece of carpet would be epic.
Yea, there are so many good Disney movies, I need to rewatch them
Yea, we should do a Disney marathon session.
