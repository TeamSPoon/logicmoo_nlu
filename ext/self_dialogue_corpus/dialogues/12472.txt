How excited are you for the upcoming Han Solo movie?
Cautiously excited.
Only cautiously?
I'm worried because both directors left.
They did? I didn't hear about that.
Yes, apparently there were creative differences.
That's not good.
No, it sounds worrying.
Oh well. At least we have the rest of them!
This is true!
