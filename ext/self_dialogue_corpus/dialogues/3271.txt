What do you think is the scariest horror movie?
I would have to say some thing with a paranormal element.
Like Blair Witch?
That one is so scary! When they are running with the camera, I always scream!
I like stuff with vampires too.
Or anything with a ghost element.
Like Paranormal activity?
That one and the second one, wow, when the baby is all possessed!
The Conjuring is another one.
I need to see that one!
