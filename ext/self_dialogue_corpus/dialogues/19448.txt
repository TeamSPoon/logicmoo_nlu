What is your favorite genre of music?
Death metal is my favorite.
Isn't that like "screamo" yelling music that sounds like guttural noises and barking?  How can you listen to that?
I agree the vocal are a little ridiculous but I actually listen to it for the instruments.
What do you mean?
Well, death metal is the most demanding genre of music so it requires more skilled musicians.
Ha!  I doubt that!
Really!  Most accomplished death metal players are also able to play lower forms of music like country, rock, slow jams, and so on.
I didn't know that.  Can you recommend someone?
Well, Jon 5 is an amazing guitar player to spans several genres.  He's know for being in Marilyn Manson but his solo work includes diverse playing styles; even "chicken pickin!"
Ok, I can be open to that.  What about the weirder side of these groups.  Aren't they controversial.
Yes, but that's not what attracted me to them.
What did make you interested?
Most people think it's parental or societal rebellion but, for me, it's just the skill of the players.
Have you been to any concerns?
Of course!
What's your favorite part?
As a female, I love the long hair of the male musicians.  Long hair is very common among metal heads but greasy hair is a no go!
Ha!  I totally agree.  But, are there even many death metal shows that come through our area?
Oh yeah!  It's more common than you'd think.  Probably at least 1 tour every month.  Here, I'll show you some upcoming concerns in our area.
