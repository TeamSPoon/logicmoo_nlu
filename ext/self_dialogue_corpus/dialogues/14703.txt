The Western Conference Finals is finally set.
Yes.  The Spurs and the Warriors.
It feels like this is the matchup everyone has been waiting for this entire season.
It sure feels that way. Who do you think will win?
Oh, I think you have to go with the Warriors.  I mean they haven't lost a single game in the playoffs yet.
That is amazing.  I too think the Warriors are the favorite.
I don't think you can ever write off the Spurs though.
Well yea.  Parker goes out for the season, Kawhi gets hurt, and yet the beat the Rockets.
Yes.  It seemed like everyone wrote off the Spurs, and then all of a sudden they destroyed the Rockets.
That Game 6 performance shows what the Spurs are capable of if they are firing on all cylinders.
Agreed, and they did that without Kawhi, their best player.
I think they have to play a similar way against the Warriors.
Yes, you are right.  You can't match small on small with the Warriors or try to shoot 3s with them.
Yes, nobody can beat the Warriors playing that way.  Well maybe except the Cavaliers.
But the Spurs don't have that kind of firepower.  I think they need to stay big and try to play inside.
I agree.  They need huge games from Aldridge and Gasol.
Yes.  That margin for error is super thin.  I don't think those big guys can even have one game where they play poorly.
You are right.  If the Spurs pull of the upset, it will probably take 7 games.
And they are going to need Gasol and Aldridge to play well in all 7 games.
And of course, they need Kawhi back healthy and playing at a high level.
