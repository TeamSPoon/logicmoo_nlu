What music have you been listening to?
Some of Halsey.
Oh really? I have not been able to really get into her.
Yeah I guess she is an acquired taste.
I just bought her new album.
Was it released recently,
Yes it was.
She sounds very auto tuned.
Maybe, but she definitely has talent.
That is for sure.
So what have you been listening to?
Lords
