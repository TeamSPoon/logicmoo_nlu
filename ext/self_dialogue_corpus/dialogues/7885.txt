I watched the last two Harry Potter movies this past weekend.
What did you think?
They were pretty good. I wish I had seen them when they came out in theaters.
Yeah, it is more exciting to see the action taking place on the big screen.
There were many scenes that had me holding my breath.
Oh, right. I forgot you did not read the books. Which scenes are you talking about?
For example, the scene where Harry, Ron, and Hermione were running away from the Death Eaters in the woods.
Oh yeah, and how about the scene when they visited Godric's Hollow and the old lady turned out to be the snake? That was scary.
But I thought the battle scene could have been more epic.
Really? I thought it was well done.
