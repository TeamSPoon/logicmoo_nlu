Who do you have between the Spurs and Rockets tomorrow?
Spurs all the way, I can't stand Houston.
My heart says San Antonio, but my mind says Houston is going to take this series.
What makes you say that?
I think the Houston offense is just too much for the Spurs. It's too fast and too strong.
Well, the Spurs did win 3 out of 4 during the regular season.
The regular season doesn't matter anymore though, the playoffs is its own season.
You don't think Kawhi Leonard can outplay James Harden?
Maybe he can, but what about the rest of the team? In the last game, the Rockets were looking like they had too many weapons to stop.
Sure, but the two games before that were all San Antonio.
That's true, but as the series goes on, I think the Spurs get more tired. They have some old players.
True, but I think there are enough young players that can get minutes and be effective, too.
Only if Popovich decides to play them. He is stubborn about going with his veterans.
That does frustrate me at times, but he has shown that he knows what he's doing.
Anyway, I will be rooting for the Spurs, even if I don't think they'll win. I can't stand Harden.
Me either. The NBA really needs to look into how he tries to bait the refs into calling fouls and change the rules this season.
That would be nice, but it would be even nicer to have him embarrassed by the Spurs.
Amen to that.
Anyway, whatever happens in this series I still think Golden State will destroy either team in the next round.
Unfortunately, I think you're right.
