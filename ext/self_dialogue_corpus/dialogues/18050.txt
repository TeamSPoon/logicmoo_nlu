Have I told you recently how much I love Lady Gaga?
She's okay, I'm not really a fan.
Have you heard her new stuff?
I didn't know she had any new stuff.
Yeah, she did a new album, it's called Joanne.
Oh, I've heard of the Album but I didn't know it was hers.
Yeah, it's different then her other stuff.
It's like country music isn't it?
Kind of. It's a lot slower and more country then her other stuff.
Do you like it?
I really liked her older stuff, but it's good too.
Hmmm, maybe I will check it out.
You should, I feel like you would like it.
Do you have a favorite song on the album?
Yes, I really like Joanne.
Isn't that the name of the album?
Yes, but it's also the name of one of the songs.
Oh, I hate it when musicians name their albums after a song.
Yeah, it makes it difficult to search for the song.
Yeah, well I'll listen to it later and see if I like it.
