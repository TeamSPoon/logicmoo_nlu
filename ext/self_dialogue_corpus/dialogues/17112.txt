Do you know who sings Thrift Shop?
It's by Macklemore & Ryan Lewis.
Oh right, thank you. I wanted to buy it off iTunes but couldn't remember who sings it.
Well while your there check out their other songs.
They did more, I didn't know. Are there any good ones I should look at first?
You have to listen to White walls. It's a great song about white wall tires on his Cadillac.
That doesn't sound that good.
Trust me it is, and also check out Can't Hold Us and Same Love.
Wait I've heard Can't hold us, I didn't know it was the same guys.
Who did you think it was.
I thought it was Justin Bieber.
Wow, you were way off.
Well it made me think of Love Yourself.
Wait, I thought that was an Ed Sheeren song.
See, I'm not the only one, but no it's definately a Bieber song.
Well that would explain why I could find that under Ed's music.
Well at least you didn't think it was a lady gaga song or something.
I knew it was a guy singing it, I'm not that stupid.
I think we need a music marathon on YouTube and really put some names to voices.
That would actually come in handy, and I can show you those songs/
