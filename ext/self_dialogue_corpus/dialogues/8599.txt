You like Led Zeppelin music?
Love Zeppelin!! Great rock band.
To bad Robert plant won't tour with the band anymore.
I'm thinking he can't hit those notes anymore.
You could be right.
He said no to playing at Coachella with all the,old time rockers.
Yea,turned down millions I guess.
Would have been cool.
Would have been great hearing stairway to heaven again.
My favorite Zeppelin song.
