Who is your favorite Fast and Furious character?
I really like Han myself.
Really? Why's that?
He seems to be really cool and chill. Always calm under pressure.
I see.
He also has him moments of humor, and he feels like he stands out among characters that seem more similar.
Anything else you like?
Well, he was in Tokyo Drift, which I like. I think Japan is interesting and drifting looks cool.
Yeah that wasn't too bad a movie, was it?
Nope. I liked it.
