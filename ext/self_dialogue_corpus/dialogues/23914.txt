I'm thinking of watching a movie today.
I haven't been to one of those in ages.  Anything look good?
I don't know, man.  There seems to be an awful lot of reboots here.
Reboot?  What are you talking about?
Remake.  Do-over.  Reimagining.
You mean a sequel?
No. Now that's something I could go for.
What are you talking about?
I'm talking about when some new young, up-and-coming director takes some old movie and makes it now-a-days.
I guess I still don't know what you mean.  I hear it can take time to make some movies.
That's not what I mean.  You remember Godzilla?
Yeah. That thing was a trip.  Squashing and destroying that poor Japanese town.
Well they've already remade the first one twice.
Two more movies!  Are they out now?
No.  But I'm sure both of them are playing on pay-per-view now.  They are basically the same move done at different times.
So if I watch the first one, it's gonna look exactly like that one?
Yes.  Maybe with a few modern elements and references.
Didn't they do that with a bunch of movies already?
And television shows, toys, and games.  Most pop culture fads we both grew up with.
No, thanks. You can go see your reboot. I think I'm just going to stay here and crash for the rest of the day.
