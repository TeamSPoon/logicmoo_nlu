So i was worried about Ariana Grande a couple of weeks ago.
Oh, i know with the attack in england.
Yes, i was concerned that she was injured. The news said nothing of her for the first few hours.
I had thought the same thing. I kept flipping channels to see.
I'm glad she is alright.
Me too.
I thought it was great of her to do the memorial concert so soon after that.
She is the best.
Did you know she is dating Mac Miller?
Really? I had no clue!
Yes, they have been dating a while now.
He's a upcomming rap star. I love his music.
Me too, i have him on my Pandora selection.
No way! So do i!
He is great. I wish him anf Ariana would do a duet together.
OMG, that would be awesome.
We can always hope.
So true. So, what are they doing now?
Well, i know she is still on tour and i think he is in the studio.
I can't wait for him to go on tour.
