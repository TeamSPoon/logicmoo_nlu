Did you pick up the new limited edition Clutch release?
No, I almost pre-ordered it, but money is tight. I have tickets to see them this summer though.
Oh yeah? With Primus?
Yeah, that should be quite a show.
I'd imagine so. I've never seen Primus.
Me neither, and I'm not really a huge fan, but I'm looking forward to it.
Yeah, I've always appreciated the way Les plays bass, and Herb's style on drums is perfect.
Right, but it gets to feel kind of gimmicky after a while, just Les showing off.
Wonder how the sets will compare between them and Clutch.
Not having any experience with a Primus show, I have no idea, but we both know how shows with just Clutch are.
I need to see them again -- haven't seen them since the Beale Street tour.
I read somewhere just today about someone who saw them at 'Toolfest' -- I don't even know what that is.
I don't think it was an actual thing -- like not by that name -- but Tool played with a bunch of other bands.
Oh man, seeing Tool and Clutch at the same show would be amazing.
I only hope I get the chance to see Tool again. I'm surprised they're even touring now.
Well, they supposedly have a new album in the works.
Yeah, as they have for several years now.
How long has it been since 10,000 Days?
I'm not even sure. I'd have to look it up, but they're output sure doesn't compare to the way Clutch steadily keeps the releases coming.
Absolutely. Probably, what, more than twice as many records as Tool in just about the same amount of time?
