Do you like Kendrick Lamar?
He's one of my favorite rappers. What's your favorite album?
Tough to pick, but probably 'Good Kid, MAAD City'. You?
Agreed, it's tough, but I guess 'To Pimp A Butterfly'.
You've heard 'Damn.', yes?
Yeah, and I think in time that will become my favorite Kendrick album. I love the music videos so far.
'DNA' had Don Cheadle in which I didn't see happening but I love it.
He did great, and Kendrick really went with the whole Kung Fu Kenny persona.
It fits with the style of music though, so I can see why.
He's just an extremely creative artist, which is rare nowadays.
