Have you ever seen a Sinbad movie?
No I haven't. What is a good one?
I would check out the one called Jingle All The Way.
What is that about?
It is a holiday movie about two people trying to get toy for their kids.
Interesting. Is there a lot of action?
There is a lot of action. They have a battle of the wits and things are always happening.
I never knew there were action holiday movies.
Well now you know. Check this out as soon as you can.
I will do this soon. Sinbad is such a cool name!
