Did you watch the Superbowl last year?
Yes.  The Patriots and Falcons.
That was a pretty good game.
It was.
Usually the Superbowl is not a very close game.
Not true of that one.
I thought Atlanta was going to win.
So did I.
I was rooting for Atlanta.
I was rooting against the Patriots.
Why is that?
I war mostly rooting against Tom Brady.
Because of the whole deflate gate?
No.
Another reason?
I just don't care for his personality.
He does act childish at times.
Yes he does.
I would like to see them not do so well this year.
I am right there with you.
