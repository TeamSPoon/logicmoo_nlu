What are you looking forward to most about the upcoming NFL season?
I am just hoping that the Pittsburgh Steelers can finally get back to the Superbowl,
I did not know that you were a Steelers fan.
Yes! I have been a huge fan ever since I was little.
Do you have high expectations for them this year?
yes, I think we can go all the way if things fall in place!
I really thought they were going to the Superbowl last year.
I did to; the Patriots were just to good though!
Yea, beating Tom Brady at home is a very tough thing to do.
It sure is! We really need to get home field advantage this year to have a chance.
That would certainly help quite a bit.
I really want Ben Roethlisberger to get one more ring before he retires.
Even if he fails to do so, he will still be considered a legend when he decides to hang them up.
I agree with you about that! I think he will be in the Hall of Fame one day.
Do you think he is the best quarterback in Steeler's history?
In my opinion he is because of all the things he has accomplished.
He has been great, but I think I would go with Terry Bradshaw over him.
A lot of people say that, but I was not old enough to watch him play.
He was really good! He won four Superbowl's in a six year period.
My dad has always said he was the best quarterback ever.
