Name the movie that this quote is from: "You've got dirt on your nose, did you know?".
Easy, "Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone"! Hermoine says it to Ron Weasley on the train, right after they meet.
I love that you're a Harry Potter fan! Here's another: "Happiness can be found even in the darkest of times if one only remembers to turn on the light".
I can't remember which one it is from, but I know Albus Dumbledore says it to one of the kids. Which one was it again?
It's from the third one, "Harry Potter and The Prisoner of Azkaban". Dumbledore says it to the whole school!
Oh yeah, you're such a nerd! Who is your favorite character again?
I have to choose just one character? My top 5 are Fred and George Weasley, Molly Weasley, Snape, Ron and Doby!
Those are good one! Molly Weasley is my favorite!
She's such a great mom, and so funny! "Where HAVE you been?"
So funny! Remember when she sent that screamer to Ron because he stole the car? I would've died if my mom did that!
