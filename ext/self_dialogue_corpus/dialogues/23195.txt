When does the new "Spiderman" movie come out?
I believe it is opening on July 7th.
Who is the main character in "The Mummy" that just came out?
I think Tom Cruise, but I also believe Russell Crowe is in it.
I do not recognize the female lead role. Her name is Sofia Boutella.
So she is the mummy? She seems very young to have a lead in the movie.
Have you seen the new DC Comic movie?
Yes, I loved "Wonder Woman". It is my favorite DC Comic movie so far.
Did you know that the lead character is from israel?
Yes, her name is Gal Gadot.
Do you think "Despicable Me 3" will do as well as the other two in the franchise?
I do because everyone loves the Minions.
Have you seen any Grace Kelly and Cary Grant movies on AMC?
I have seen the 1955 version of "To Catch a Thief".
I thought they were both in "North by Northwest".
No, the female lead in that 1959 movie was Eva Marie Saint.
My favorite movie of all time is "Gone With the Wind".
It's old. It came out in 1939, but I did think Clark Gable played his part well.
Have you seen any war movies with Ronald Reagan?
Yes, I saw "This is the Army" with my grandfather last week on AMC.
