Who do you think the best pop star of all time is?
I don't know.  I think maybe Beyonce.
How about Michael Jackson?
Michael Jackson is a legend, but for the younger generations I believe Beyonce is the queen.
Michael Jackson has been a pop fixture since his early days in the Jackson 5.  People still sing the song "I'll be there" even though it is decades old.
That's true.  His songs will be played for a long time.
I don't want to take anything away from Beyonce.  She is very talented.
I think her "Lemonade" album is probably one of her best.  Songs like "Formation" tackled some tough political issues.
I remember her being criticized for being too political in her Super Bowl routine.
She certainly isn't afraid to take a stand when she wants to.
