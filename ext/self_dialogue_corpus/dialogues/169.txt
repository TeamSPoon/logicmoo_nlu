Why do you think Peter Parker didn't use his Spiderman abilities to make money more?
He used them to deliver pizza
It seems like there would be some kind of job that he would excel at
Maybe he thought his time was better spent studying
Spiderman couldn't really do web slinging outside of New York
He couldn't do much outside of Manhattan
That's true
If the bad guy crossed a bridge, it seems like Peter would be in trouble
There is not much crime in Manhattan
Yeah, I wonder if he could have gotten sponsored by companies
