I think Ben Affleck is the best Batman.
I know. His Batman matches the cartoons and comics the most.
Patty Jenkins needs to direct the next Superman movie.
Wonder Woman had Superman vibes all over it.
I hope Spider-Man Homecoming turns out to be good.
So far 2004's Spider-Man 2 is still the best.
I love the part where he turns into Pac-man.
Do you mean Peter Quill? Yeah, that was hilarious.
I hope the Green Lantern shows up at the end of Justice League.
That will put it over the top.
