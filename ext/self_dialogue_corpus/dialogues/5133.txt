Did you see that Giants game yesterday?
Yeah.  Happy flight home after that one.
It's about time!  They've been terrible on the road this year.
Not much better at home.  What do you think of that kid, Arroyo?
Kid can hit!  He needs practice at third, though.
Yeah, Crawford will be back any day now.  He'll show him the ropes.
If he can learn 3rd as well as Duffy did, we'll have the best fielding infield in baseball.
Now if Belt will just start hitting . . .
Dude, if he can keep getting on base by taking walks, I don't care if he never gets another home run.
A walk's as good as a single.  I'll take it.
You hate to see all that power go to waste, though.
Yeah.  Maybe Bonds could work with him.  Give him some pointers.
Looks like Posey's all recovered from his concussion.
Yeah baby!  3 homers in 3 days!
Pence is even getting in on the action.  They won that game in the 9th, just like they used to.
Yeah looks like they're finally feeling like a team.  Working together.
Gotta do something about the bullpen, though. Keep Kontos and Law, put Melancon on notice, and ship the rest of them out.
With Samardjia right behind them.
Amen to that.
Hope Bumgarner heals up soon.  Really miss his pitching and his bat
