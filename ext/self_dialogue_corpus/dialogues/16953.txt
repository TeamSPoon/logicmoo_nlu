What type of electronic music do you like?
I prefer house and techno.How about you?
I like house more than techno, do you like EDM?
I hate EDM, it is very annoying.
I agree I can not stand it myself. Who do you like?
I like all kinds but my favorite DJ is DUbfire and Liebing and you?
I like them as well, but I prefer people like Carl Cox.
Yes, I like COx, as well. He is a fun dj to listen to. Ever seen him live?
I have actually I went to Ultra in Miami, you ever been?
I have been actually- I found the crowd to be a little too much edm like for me.
Yes, I agree the crowd is very young and immature. I did like the light show though.
Yes, they put alot of money towards production which is cool.
Yeah I love big light shows, adds to the fun.
I do to, but honestly Id rather hear them in a dark club. Especially Techno.
Yeah I can see that- techno is darker and doesnt sound as good during the day.
I agree I like House music during the day though- that fits the moood and time.
I agree, nothing like a sunset house music set, good vibes and good beats.
Very true, we should share music one time.
We should email some good techno sets
I will send me some house sets when you can.
