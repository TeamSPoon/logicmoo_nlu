I miss the old Disney movies.
Old?  Name some examples.
I am talking about movies like Aladdin, Lion King, and Fantasia.
Fantasia is a classic.
It is.  It used to freak me out when I was younger
The villain of the movie scared me too.  Chernabog.
Did you know that Chernabog was actually a character from mythology?
No I didn't.  What country's mythology?
It came from the Slavic nations.  Walt Disney said that Chernabog represented Satan himself.
Well that is unsettling.
