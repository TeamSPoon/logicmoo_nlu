I don't want to watch Disney movies tonight.
Why not?
Because! Snow White is just a girl that sleeps, I don't want to watch something about a toad, and I hate the snow!
You should really give them a chance. They're more than just sleeping girls and animals.
Really? Like what?
Well, Mulan, for instance. She saves an entire kingdom by herself.
Really? How?
Well, you'll have to watch it to find out.
Fine. I guess we can watch Mulan. But nothing else!
Let's watch Mulan, then. At least you're giving it a chance.
