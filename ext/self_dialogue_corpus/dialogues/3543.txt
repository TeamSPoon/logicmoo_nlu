Is Crimson Peak a horror movie or something else?
That depends. I think it is classified as horror, but it is also a kind of gothic drama.
Guillermo del Toro's movies always creep me out. Is Crimson Peak like his others?
Yes. Beautiful and stylistic, with insane practical effects. The special effects makeup for the ghosts is incredible.
Also it has Tom Hiddleston, who played Loki in the Avengers. How is he in the movie?
He's all right. He isn't the main character, but if you like him, there is a lot of him.
One thing I love about Guillermo del Toro is even his darkest movies are hopeful.
That is what makes me unsure if Crimson Peak is horror. It is atmospheric, and tense sometimes, but never truly horrific.
What about the ghosts?
They are definitely spooky!
