So who were you rooting for in the Super Bowl last year?
The Broncos, of course!
Yes, silly question I know...
Where did you watch the game?
I was at my best friend's house...rooting for the Panthers.
How upset were you that the Broncos won?
I was pretty angry at the time but I got over it.
I hope the Broncos can do as well this year!
Do you think they will?
I honestly don't know.  There are a lot of great teams.
True.  It would be nice to see the Panthers do well.
I think they will.  A lot of money goes into that team.
Well, they sure do have a lot of talent.
Of course, they're also surrounded with some controversy.
It seems like every time is sooner or later!
Yes, I just don't let it impact my enjoyment.
I don't either.  Wouldn't it be amazing if it was the same two teams in the Super Bowl this year?
It sure would!  It would be unlikely though...
I know but I would love too see the Panthers get a rematch!
If that happens we'll go together!
