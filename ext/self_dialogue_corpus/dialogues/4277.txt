Can you recommend any good thrillers?
A classic is Silence of The Lambs.
I've never seen it, its good?
Yes, its a really good blend of characters and story.
Anthony Hopkins is one of my favorite actors, so I will check it out.
I liked the sequels too, but the 1st is the best.
I'm excited to see how it lives up to todays standards.
Don't worry, it more than holds up.
Have you seen The Shining?
Yes, another classic thriller!
