Man summers are so boring !!  I can not wait until football season
I hear you brother  . I ll gladly trade mowing the lawn for sitting at the bar drinking beer watching games
Who is going to win the NFC . Oh nevermind I know who you got
Of course Dallas all the way baby  . No one can stop Dak  and  Zeke
Dak Prescott is so overated it is ridiculous  . Ezekiel Elliott  is the real deal though. Jerry Jones will never win again . He has the Switzer curse going
hahaha   in 1996 The  Cowboys won the Super Bowl in spite of Switzer not because of him .
Sorry dude you guys aren t even going to win the division  . it is the Giants year
Talk about over rated  The Manning family and especially Eli are the definition
He will have 1 last great year  . Hear me now believe me later
Mannings last great year will be his first . What a bum
All right  All right I can see this is going nowhere . You think anyone can beatthe Patriots in the AFC ?
Its going to be tough because the AFC Championship game always  ends in Foxboro  but yes Brady is too old
I agree  I dont think  Coach Belichik is hungry anymore either . He is hollywood now
If the kid out of Clemson is even halfway good the Texans will go to the Super Bowl . QB play was Houston's only weakness
always goes back to coaching O" Brien is a lousy coach . He will screw Watson up  and he won t get the Texans out of the 1st round
You know nothing about football  !!  Alright genius  ell me who is going to win the AFC
You ll laugh but if it happens  Im going to be very rich  . odds will be like 20 to 1 at least
oooo  I am intrigued . I always love a live under dog . Who ya got ?
The Jacksonville Jaguars  . it will be the Tom Coughlin Bowl  remember he coached the Giants . Best coach in football and Leonard Fournette will be the best running back since Walter Payton
You need a  refund on that crystal ball  . iwill repeat myself when i can stop laughing .  You know nothing  about football  !!!!
