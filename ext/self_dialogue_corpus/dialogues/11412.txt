You ever listened to the Beatles?
I'm a little bit of a fan.
Who was your favorite?
I always thought they were the best together.
Well, who did you think had the best solo career?
I used to prefer John, but now I guess I'd rather listen to Paul's solo stuff.
What is your favor song that Paul released?
I don't know, maybe Live and Let Die, or Band on the Run.
What was your favorite song by John?
Definately Imagine, but he did a good cover of Stand By Me.
