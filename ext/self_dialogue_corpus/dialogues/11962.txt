They should bring back Mace Windu.
He's dead, though.  You can't get deader than falling out a window like that.
Luke fell out of Cloud City.  And yet, he lived.
Luke had Leia to pick him up.
First he used the Force to guide himself into a chute that opened at an improbable moment.  Mace is better than that. He could have one of those flying cars.
That is more plausible than Darth Maul's survival, and hurts the story less.
They'll probably bring him back for Episode 9.
I think they'd use  him in Rebels, instead,
Rebels can't afford Samuel L. Jackson.
They can't afford a lot of people. It hasn't really stopped them.
