do you like the south park movie
the movie was not bad at all
yeah, it was as funny as the show
it was kinda like an extended show to me
yeah, they could have just done the show with 4 episodes to it
yeah, that movie was not bad though
i would see another movie with them
i think they did do another movie
well, then i didnt see it
well, its probably not necessary
do you have a favorite character
i like stan the best
why?
he relates to me. he is the leader
yeah, i like cartman
but he is the biggest jerk
but he makes the show what it is
yeah, if he wasnt in the show, it would be way different
he isnt expendable
hes got to stay
