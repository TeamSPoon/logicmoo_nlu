Ready for some football?
Yes I cannot wait to see my Vikings, Saints and Seahawks play!
You like three teams, well that is certainly something.
Gives me better odds that one of them wins.
Playing the numbers game right.
It's more of the fact that my favorite players are on those teams, I am not really loyal to a specific team.
So you root more for the players instead of the team.
Yes, I just find it better that way, it gets me more invested in the game, it also gives me more games to watch.
I can't fault you for that.
What about you, who are you rooting for?
I am a true blue Cowboys fan, have been ever since my youth.
America's team huh? They are really back in contention now.
They are, but I am still sad that we could not win one with Romo.
Yeah, he had so much talent, just could not get one for Dallas.
Well now we have a great overall team, I think he could do a lot with the personnel if he was our quarterback still.
I think so too, that team is built to contend.
Anyway we should go to a bar and watch a game sometime this season.
That sounds like fun, I would love too.
Yeah and knowing how many teams you like we will find a game easily.
Well, we'll make sure the Cowboys are also playing.
