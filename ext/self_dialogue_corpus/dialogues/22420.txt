I saw the new Amy Schumer movie last night!
Snatched? Oh how was it? I'm dying to see it!
It was hysterical! I can't wait to see it again!
Was it better than Trainwrecked?
It didn't have as much gross humor as Trainwrecked - though it did have some! But otherwise it was a lot better.
Yeah Trainwrecked got really boring toward the end when she fell in love with the ugly doctor.
I know! Why did they pick him, of all people, to be her love interest?
Probably because her first love interest in the movie was John Cena, and they needed someone completely unattractive and weak by comparison.
That's probably true. Anyway this movie takes place mostly in Nicaragua!
Wow, that sounds interesting. Do they get mixed up with a drug cartel or something?
No, they get kidnapped and held for ransom. Amy and her mother, who is played by Goldie Hawn.
That must be hilarious! Do they trek through the jungle and stuff?
Yeah, and they both get filthier and filthier as the movie goes on.
I want to see it more than ever now!
We should go this weekend and see it, I was planning to watch it again anyway.
Okay, let's go! Are there any handsome guys in the movie?
Only one, one of the guys who is involved with the kidnappers is really gorgeous.
Nice! Better than John Cena?
Much better looking. Not as grossly muscular with long dark hair and eyes.
Sounds lovely.
