Okay, what did you think of Force Awakens?
Weeel... I don't know.  It was okay, I guess.  I mean, it was good to see Star Wars again, but I really they retread the plot of the first film too much.
How so?
Really?  You need to ask?  Well, let's start at the beginning...
Okay.
We got a young protagonist on a desert planet (again), and she find a droid that has secret plans the bad guys want.
Yeah, it does sound kind of familiar.
She finds out she has talents she doesn't know about and goes to get advice from a short alien.
Yeah, see what you mean.. we even have a big planet destroyer again.
Exactly.
