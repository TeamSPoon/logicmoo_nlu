hey buddy you remember that movie Snatched we saw last week?
oh..? you mean the one with Goldie hawn in it?
yeah thats the one! that was a really emotional movie
I know, the part when the mom and his daughter had that moment in the basement brought tears to my eyes!
yeah we will have to rent it again on blu ray, its defiantly worth the price
Yeah.. what  other movies starred Goldie hawn, you know any more?
Let me think... Oh! Death becomes her! that movie was intense
yeah that was a pretty great movie.. to live forever, what a thought right!?
yeah who would want to live forever anyways?
Yeah not me, one lifetime is enough for me
