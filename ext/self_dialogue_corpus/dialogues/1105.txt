The Eagles are going to be so good this year.
Eh, not sure I'm buying that.
How about I school you as to why I feel that way?
Please, by all means.
Well first of, Wentz is going to dominate.
Anything will be better than last year.
He was good last year!
Good?  Don't make me laugh.
He did great for a rookie.
He dinked and dunked the whole year.  Didn't throw a pass more than ten yards.
They kept the offense vanilla for him to make it easier.
Exactly.  I thought he was supposed to be cerebral and smart.
He is, but it's not easy to learn a NFL playbook.
I get that, but you're overestimating him.
In any event, I think they can compete for the division.
Maybe.  Just depends on their defense.
See, I think it depends on the arm of Wentz.
To score points, yes, but they can't give up so many easy TD's again.
Yeah, their secondary was pretty poor last year.
We will have to see how they fare this year.
