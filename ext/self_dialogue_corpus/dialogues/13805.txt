What is your favorite lady Gaga Music video
I think bad romance was the best
Why do you think so?
The use of costumes and colors was so unique at the time, nobody else was doing that
Thats true, it was a very unique video both in song and style
I haven't seen any recent stuff after that one though
Not even Born this Way?
No not yet
I recommend it. It's a very heart touching video
i'll have to check it out then
