Who is your favorite band of all time?
Wow, there are so many good ones, that's a tough question. You first.
That's easy for me. My favorite band has been Nine Inch Nails for as long as I can remember!
Interesting, don't hear that everyday. Why them?
Well for one thing, they were really the first band to introduce me to something other than standard radio rock.
OK, I can see that, but still aren't they a little to hard core or even violent?
Ha, you are not the first person to say that to me. Have you listened to much of their music?
I mean I have heard their main songs, but I have never paid that much attention to them.
Well they are definately a loud band, and they have had some pretty rough songs. But they also have some stuff that is mello and even melodic.
I would not have really guessed that from them.
Oh yeah! And what is more, the lead singer, Trent Reznor, is really a musical genious!
What makes you say that?
Besides Nine Ince Nails, he has scored movies one of which even won an Oscor.
No kidding? Nine Inch Nails?
Totally! And he has produced a lot of music for other artists as well. From rap to other Industrial bands.
Well maybe I should do a deep dive on them some time!
Absolutely. Now back to my question, who is YOUR favorite band?
I guess I do owe you an answer now don't I?
I would say so.
OK, I think my favorite band of all time would have to be Led Zeplin.
