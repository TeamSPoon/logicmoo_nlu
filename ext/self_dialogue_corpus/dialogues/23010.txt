Ever seen The Natural?
Yes!  That movie was really good.
Yeah, cliche but feel good through and through.
I loved all the feats Robert Redford did throughout that movie.
Like when he stuck out the Whammer.
I loved when he knocked the ball out of it's casing.
Yeah every time that gets me feeling tingly inside.
Through the whole movie it's like that.
I also like the part when his friend ask him to pitch and it's so hard it goes through the net.
Yeah, and this wonder bat of his.  I like how a kid made one at the end.
Yes, and the part when he knocks out the clock.
Yep, any time you hear that music and the thunder comes you know something is going to happen.
Yeah, one of my favorite baseball movies.
That would be a good one to see with the kiddo.
Yeah it would.  It's such a good clean movie too
As I said, cliche but feel good.
I heard the original ending he struck out.
I heard that too but I like this one better.
I mean who doesn't?
I swear I almost wanted to cry when he was circling the bases.
