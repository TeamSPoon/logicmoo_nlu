So, tell me about your picture here.
The one at Ray-Jay?
Yes, that was during a game, right?
Yes, that was my first Bucs game i went too.
Very cool. that was 16 years ago.
Correct. Scott and i went to the Bucs VS New England game.
Right on. How was it?
Good game, funny story behind it.
Really? What happened?
Well, it was the second quarter. Bout a minute or two before half-time.
Bucs winning or losing?
Winning if you can believe that.
Right on, continue.
So as usual the afternoon storm came rolling in and there was a delay of game.
I hate when that happens.
Me too. Anyway, this lightning bolt came down right in the parking lot!
NO WAY!
Yes. It took out someones truck.
Oh wow.
Yeah, scott was freaking because we parked on that side where the lightning struck. Fun times at the stadium.
