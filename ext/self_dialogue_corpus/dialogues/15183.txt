I heard a song by the Traveling Wilburys today.
They are great, I love that band.
They had some great musicians.
Yes they really did.
Yes, Tom Petty, Bob Dylan, George harrison and Roy Orbison to name a few.
They could really harmonize.
Sure Could. One of my favorite songs was End of the Line.
I think the band was started by George Harrison, one of the Beatles.
I think so.
What are some of your favorite songs they did.
Well I love Handle with Care.
That is a good one.
Roy Orbison really had a great voice.
They all did! Tom Petty is one of my favorites.
I think they put out three albums.
Yes I believe so.
I am not sure if Roy Orbison was on all three, I think he passed away after the second one came out.
He may have.
George Harrison and Bob Dylan were great as well.
Yes, that was a great band. Full of some of the great musicians!
