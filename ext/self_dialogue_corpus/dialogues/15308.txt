Did you see the Deftones are supporting Trump?
Really, no way.
yep, they posed wearing MAGA T-shirts
That's funny
So what music are you into lately?
I've been listening to 80s big hair metal bands
Oh, likely Motley Crue
Yeah, and a few others like Poison.
I've been in the mood for Country and Western lately.
Current or classic.
Mostly top 40 country stuff
Yeah, sometimes I get in the mood for something down home and fun.
Who's your all time favorite country artist?
I think probably Waylon Jennings
Didn't Waylong perform with Willie Nelson
He did, way back in the day with Kris Kristofferson
Ever listen to rap these days
I keep up with Eminem and a few others
I guess I'm getting old.  I don't like loud music too much now.
Try listening to classical.
