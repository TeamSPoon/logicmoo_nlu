Aerosmith is such a great band.
I love them too. They have so many great songs.
What is your favorite Aerosmith track?
"Dream On" is my favorite. I think it is one of the best songs ever written.
I prefer a different song by the band.
In that case, what is your favorite?
"Sweet Emotion" is my favorite song by Aerosmith.
Interesting! I love the chorus of that track.
But I am also a big fan of the song "Crazy"
I don't particularly like that song to be honest.
That's OK. We can agree to disagree.
Steven Tyler is the frontman of the band, correct?
Indeed he is! He used to be a judge on American Idol too.
He has crazy fashion sense. He is a very unique guy.
He is an excellent singer. He is probably one of the best around.
Does the band still perform?
They don't play as much as they used to. But they definitely still perform.
How old is Steven Tyler now?
I think he is 69 now.
Wow! I hope I can still perform when I am that old
