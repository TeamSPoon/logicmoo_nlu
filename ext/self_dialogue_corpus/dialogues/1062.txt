What afc team do you think will make the SUPERBOWL this year?
I'm sure it's not the jets.
Oh boy,I have to agree on that.
They are brutal.
The organization is terrible.
They have been for years.
I think New England gets back again.
You can never count them out.
Not while Tom Brady is still at quarterback.
Not while bill belichek is head coach either.
He's the best head coach in football.
I can't disagree with that.
I loved him as Giants defensive coordinator under bill parcels.
He was great.
They made quite the team together.
Yes they did.
Do you think belle he's made the right move leaving The jets?
Wow,I guess we know the answer to that.
Parcels had him all set up.
Or at least he thought he did.
