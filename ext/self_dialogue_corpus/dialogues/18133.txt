Have you heard of Lifehouse?
I have yes!
Are you a fan?
I am actually a big fan, I have even met the band before.
Really? That's awesome, where at?
They were actually the church band where my family went every Sunday when I was young.
That is really cool.
Yeah it was before they got famous so I didn't really know how cool it was at the time.
They have kind of faded away lately it seems.
Well you certainly don't hear a lot about them.
They kind of had their time in the lime light already.
Its sad because I still think they could make great music.
I feel like its been years since they have released an album.
I think has been something like ten years since their last album?
Wow, that's a long time.
I was a huge fan of their 'No Name Face' album, its probably one of my favorite albums of all time.
I have to agree, I remember I loved that album so much I learned how to play the songs on guitar.
That is cool, I've always wanted to learn guitar but I never have.
Its pretty easy to learn, you can get their music in the form of 'guitar tabs' which are a simplified version of sheet music and learn that way.
I will have to check it out, I really want to learn to play their songs.
