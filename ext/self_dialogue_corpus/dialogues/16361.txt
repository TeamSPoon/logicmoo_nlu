Could you recommend some pop music
I'm not a fan of that genre
What do you like?
I love jazz but I also listen to rock
Me too, I'm trying to diversify though.
Maybe I can recommend some reggae then?
I'd like that
Try some Bob Marley.
I hear is considered the all time best reggae artist
For a good reason
I'll check out some of his albums. How about classical music.
Like Bach compositions?
Yes that. I wonder why it is associated with rich people.
That is just a stereotype. Music cuts through all classes in the society.
You have to admit reggae is mainstream mostly in low income areas.
True. That is because the artists speak about issues the listeners can relate to.
What album are you currently listening to?
Coincidentally, Exodus.
Who is the artist?
Bob Marley the legend
