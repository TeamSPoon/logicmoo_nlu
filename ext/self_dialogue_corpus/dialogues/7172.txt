What's your favorite Disney movie?
I like Hunchback of Notre Dame.
I like that one too. It's a pretty intense movie for kids, no?
I know right? What with it talking about lust, genocide, murder, and all that.
I guess they expect those things to just fly over kid's heads.
I know right? Just focus on the singing gargoyles.
Plus they did make the ending less depressing. Everyone dies in the original version.
I know, they did that with The Little Mermaid too.
Yeah that's another one that ends on a pretty depressing note in the original.
I guess it makes sense they had to change these things.
