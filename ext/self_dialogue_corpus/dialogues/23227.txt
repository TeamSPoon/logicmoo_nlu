Have you ever seen The Five Heartbeats?
My office hours are between nine and five.
What?
The scene where Big Red was dangling dude over the balcony.
Oh yeah.
That's one of my favorite movies.
Mine too. I wonder if they were a real group.
I'm not sure but the music in the movie was the truth.
Nights Like This I wish that raindrops would fall.
I like that and the song they sang when dude's wife was going bonkers.
You mean when Eddie Kane was crooning to her and then tossed the mic?
Yeah. Eddie Kane was that dude.
I like how the soundtrack sounded very similar to the songs in the movie.
Yeah, me too. Who produced that movie?
I think Robert Townsend.
Yeah that's right. Good old Duck.
What year did that movie come out?
I think it was 1990 but I'm not sure.
Yeah, I think you're right.
Yep.
