i wonder if they will ever make a movie in the series with a different theme
What you mean bro
A fast and furious movie not about cars
Like something deeper
Yeah that exactly
It would be pretty neat would it not
I would sign up for that
It is pretty impressive idea to expand the franchise
It is always good for new things
Yeah same ol gets boring
