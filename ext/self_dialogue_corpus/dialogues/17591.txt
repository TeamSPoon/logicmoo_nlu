Have you ever seen Bruno Mars in concert?
No. How is he live?
He is great.
I like some of his songs.
He is electrifying. He puts on an awseome show.
Some of his songs are very funky.
Yes, my favorite is 24 Karat.
I think I heard it before.
He performed it on stage last night.
You sound excited!
I am! I had a long week and the concert was a breath of fresh air.
Does he have a band with him?
Yes, he has a couple of guys playing instruments and jamming on stage.
It sounds entertaining.
He also released another song last night, that is catchy too.
Can you send me a few of the songs?
How about I give you access to my itunes account?
Yes, that even better.
Knock yourself out and have fun listening.
Thanks, I'll call you tomorrow.
