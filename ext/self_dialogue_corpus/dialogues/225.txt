Are you going to see Wonder Woman?
I'll probably wait for the DVD.
Why?
I wasn't real thrilled with the actress.
I thought she was good in Batman vs. Superman.
Not that she's a bad actress, just not the right build.
She is a bit on the skinny side.
Petite to be sure.
Amazons should be a little bulkier.
You took the words right out of my mouth!
