Yeah and the first shootout at Candyland.
When they were playing Tupac songs?
Yeah that song is so cool.
Its James brown and Tupac.
Yeah they actually made a great duet.
You know Tarantino made that film right?
Yeah and he was in the movie.
Oh yeah. The part where he played the Australian.
I think Django blew him up with the dynomite.
No. I think he blew up the other guy and shot Tarantino.
That was a cool scene.
