What's a good comedy we can watch?
Have you seen "Planes, Trains & Automobiles ?"
With Steve Martin? Yes, I love that movie.
Its totally a classic, one of my all time favorite Steve Martin movies.
I really liked him in "Roxanne."
That was a good movie too.
I know, we can watch "The Three Amigos!"
I wasn't really a fan of that one.
Seriously? That's one of my favorite movies ever.
Why don't we just watch "Planes, Trains, and Automobiles?"
