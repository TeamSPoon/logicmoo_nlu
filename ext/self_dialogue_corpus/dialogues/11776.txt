I have an unpopular opinion about the Beatles.
What is it?
I think they are one of the most overrated groups of all time.
Well, it might surprise you, but I agree with you.
Their early stuff is good, solid early 1960s rock-and-roll--I want to hold your hand, She loves You--
--twist and shout, Love Me Do--
Exactly. And then a few years later, it gets more complex but takes on a melancholy I can't stand, and it's not really rock--
You mean like Eleanor Rigby?
Yep. And then within a few years of starting they're putting out nonsense like I am the Walrus.
And then "Revolution Number 9." Garbage.
