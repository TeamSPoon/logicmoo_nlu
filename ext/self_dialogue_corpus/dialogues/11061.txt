Did you ever play field hockey?
No.
So just ice hockey, then?
yes.
I guess that's the price you pay for living in Canada, eh?
Yes, eh?
Do you ever play DFS hockey?
Oh Yeah. Every week. Do you?
yeah I've recently been getting into it a lot, it's fun eh?
Yeah, I;ve lost a lot of money though, I'm down in a hole for like 400 bucks this year, I think.
I'm about the same a little less though. Around 300 bucks.
Funny thing is that you have to keep track of all the point makers. Like assists, shots, etc for the skaters, and the goalies post points for each saves and wins
Well you don't honestly keep track of all that yourself. DFS sites will do that for you.
Well some of us have our own stat sheet to follow different players and choose the players to stack on our own using that data.
What position did you play?
I played left wing mostly. Sometimes, the wings would switch positions on our team, but I played left mostly.
Is there a reason?
I'm more left handed than left. I can still change easily, but I prefer left handed.
This has to do with that whole off hand thing, right?
Off "wing." Right, so If I were to shoot left down right wing, that will be off wing.
