I just saw the 2014 AFC Divisional Playoff game.
The Patriots against the Ravens?
Yes, a good one.
If you were a Pats fan.
The Ravens had their chances.
They were ahead 14-0 in the first quarter, I remember.
But the Pats tied it in the second.
The Ravens untied it and lead 21-14 going into the half.
Flacco threw a pass to Owen Daniels.
It was a nice pass.
The Ravens scored again in the third, making it 28-14.
It started to look grim.
The Pats cut it to 28-21, Brady to the Gronk.
Then there was the trick play.
Yes, Brady to Edelman to Amendola.
It was really cool.
But the Ravens responded with a field goal.
The Pats finally got the go ahead touchdown.
Brady to LaFell.
That's all she wrote.
