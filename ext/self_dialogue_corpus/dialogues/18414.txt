Have you heard any of DJ Khaled ?
I think I saw he was on the Top 100 list of hot songs this week.
Yeah, he released an album not long ago and it was called Grateful.
Who  was the label?
Epic/Sony Records was the label for that album.
What songs on there did you enjoy?
Shining, I'm the One, and Good Man are some that I like on that new album released last week.
Sounds pretty cool, it is a very new record.  I will have to check that one out.
His music is more hip-hop.
Was that his only record?
I think it is, it has quite a few songs on it.
Is On Everything on that album too?
Yes it is. Did you hear it?
Yeah, I think so on the radio.
I like listening to new music, helps me stay current.
It is exciting to see different visions of music come up.
If I see any more of his work come up soon I will let you know.
I will have to see if  I can get his album online.
I am sure you can find it online!
Thanks!
