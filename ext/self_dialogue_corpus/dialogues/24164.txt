Do you wanna go see Baby Driver?
I have no idea what that is.
It is the new Edgar Wright movie.
Sorry, not sure who that is either.
He did Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz, etc.
Oh!  I loved those movies, what is this new one about?
Ansel Elgort plays a getaway driver named Baby.
I guess that title makes more sense now.
It currently has 100% on Rottentomatoes.
That is quite impressive.
Yea, though I feel like most of his movies are great.
I still like Shaun of the Dead the most.
What about Hot Fuzz?
I actually did not really like Hot Fuzz at all.
How about The World's End?
I also did not enjoy that one too much.
What about Scott Pilgrim?
He did Scott Pilgrim?
Yea, wrote and directed it.
I had no idea, that I liked.
