O.K. last week at our movie discussion lunch, we decided to forget The Circle and discuss good Tom Hanks films.
I'm in.
So what's your favorite.
Forrest Gump.
Yeah, I guess he's really associated with that part, but what about Philadelphia; he won an oscar for that.
He won for Forrest Gump, too.
Hmm, I don't remember that.  He was nominated for Cast Away.
Really, did the volleyball get any recognition?
Ha, ha--I think he was also nominated for Saving Private Ryan.
I didn't see that; I tend to stay away from violent movies.
Well, what did you think about Sully.
Missed that, too.
What have you seen lately?
Captain Phillips and  Bridge of Spies--both pretty good.
Yeah, not classics, but solid.
You know one I really enjoyed was the Da Vinci Code.
Yes, that was good, but I don't know if it was because of him.
I agree--the material was so compelling that a lot of actors might have done well with it.
Hanks is an icon, though.
I know some ladies that have loved him since Bosom Buddies.
