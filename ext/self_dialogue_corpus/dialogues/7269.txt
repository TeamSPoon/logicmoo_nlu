Have you ever seen Maleficent? With Angelina Jolie and Elle Fanning?
I haven't, how was it?
It was a great movie, awesome graphics. Scary at times, but good.
The classic Sleeping Beauty I love.
That is a great film. It came out in 1959!
Wow, I didn't realize it was that old. I love the song, "Once Upon a Dream"
Great song. I love Aurora, she's such a sweet character. Mary Costa did the voice for her.
I didn't know that. Who voiced Maleficent?
Eleanor Audley. She made a great Maleficent. So dark and scary.
I like the eery music when Aurora is being drawn to the spinning wheel.
