Did you see Lady Gaga cohost on RuPaul's Drag Race?
Yes! She was so great! It was so nice seeing her on the set.
I know, especially since they're almost impersonating her anyways. I loved when they lip synced to her, "Poker Face."
Speaking of "Poker Face", what's your favorite song by her overall?
I think I'd say it's, "Born This Way" since it has so much meaning behind it.
I really like the meaning behind it as well, but the beat is not my favorite.
That's true. As far as beats go, I think I like "Applause."
That beat is amazing! And the video is phenomenal.
Her videos are always great. They're so flashy and unique.
I agree! Lady Gaga is sure one of a kind. Can't wait to see what she comes up with next.
