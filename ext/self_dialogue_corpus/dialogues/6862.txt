Did you have any problems with Finding Dory?
There was one issue I had.
What was it?
It was the octopus. How was he able to stay out of the water for so long and survive?
Yes, that's true. He was out of the tank and blending into walls.
Maybe you should research as to whether octopi act like chameleons and can survive for a bit of time not in water.
I guess I could just to clear that up.
I thought the end with all the fish dropping out of the truck and into the ocean was hysterical.
Yes, that was funny. And I loved the song that played in the end.
What was the name of it?
