I'm doing some research for a film class, can you help me?
Sure.
I just have a question about movies you've watched
Okay.
Whats your favorite genre of movie?
Action/Adventure or suspense.
Why is that your favorite genre?
It keeps my at the edge of my seat when the stakes are high.
What's your least favorite genre?
Probably drama.
And why is that your least favorite movie genre?
It's the slowest pace, and i don't have much interest in romance on the big screen.
Okay final question. Who's your favorite actor?
Probably George Clooney.
Thanks for helping me with this.
No probably. What's the survey for?
I'm just doing some search for a paper.
What are you investigating?
If people's favorite actors and actresses match with their favorite genres.
Cool.
