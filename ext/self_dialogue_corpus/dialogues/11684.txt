Are you a Beatles fan?
I'm not a die hard fan but I do like some of their music.
They are seriously one of the best selling bands in history.  There were just so many hits.  What songs do you like?
I mean, probably my favorite is Imagine.
That isn't really a Beatles song.  That one was by John Lennon.
But he was in the Beatles right?
Yeah he was but he came out with that one in the 80s after they'd already broken up.
Why did they break up again if they were doing so well?
A lot of people think it was because of Yoko but I think they were kind of just done.  John Lennon said he was leaving in 1969.
I'm surprised they haven't made like a huge blockbuster hit going over their life story.
