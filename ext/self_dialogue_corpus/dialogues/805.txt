Are you interested in football at all?
Kind of, why?
What team do you root for?
Patriots, for sure. You?
Patriots, obviously! We are in New England.
What do you think of Brady?
He's the GOAT!
For sure!
I know he said he's not going to retire anytime soon but...
but what?
He's old!
He is, but he's so skilled! There's no need for him to retire anytime soon.
Yeah, true.
Did you watch the super bowl this year?
Yeah, it was amazing!
That alone is sign that Brady shouldn't retire anytime soon.
Yeah, you're right!
I'm not even a huge NFL fan, but Brady is amazing!
Do you have one of his jerseys?
No, but I definitely need one!
