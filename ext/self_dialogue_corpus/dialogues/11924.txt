Who was your favorite Beatle?
I loved them all but my favorite was John Lennon.
Me too. He was such a great songwriter and singer.
My favorite songs he wrote were A Hard DayÂ´s Night and Ticket to Ride.
Great songs! My favorites were Help! and Nowhere Man.
Some of the best were a collaboration between John and Paul.
George Harrison also wrote some great ones too.
Yeah I think While My Guitar Gently Weeps was absolutely beautiful.
That was one of the Beatles best.
Definitely one of the best in all of rock music.
