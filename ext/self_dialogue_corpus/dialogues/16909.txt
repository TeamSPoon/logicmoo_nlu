I really like Lorde's music.
Me too. Her song Team is my favorite.
I like her song Tennis Court the most.
If you like Lorde's music, you'll probably like Halsey's.
Halsey? I've never heard of them.
She's great. I've seen her in concert.
I'll have to check her music out.
I would start with the song Gasoline.
Okay. Are there any other artist out there similar to Lorde?
Hm. I don't know about most of her music, but the song Badlands by Alyssa Reid is kind of similar to Lorde.
Oh, I know that song. I really like it.
Me too, but it seems like that's the only popular song she has.
Yeah, but it's a start.
That's true. Are there any artists you would recommend?
I really like Melanie Martinez. Her voice is very unique.
Wasn't she on The Voice?
Yeah, but she has made a name for herself separate from The Voice.
What are some your favorite songs by her?
I love Dollhouse and Soap.
I've heard the song Soap before. It's pretty good.
