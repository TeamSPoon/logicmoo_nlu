I'm so excited Disney did an actual movie of beauty and the Beast.
Oh I know, I can't wait to buy it.
Did you see it in theatres?
No, I decided to wait til it is out on DVD.
I wonder how Emma Watson did as Belle?
Oh I bet she was amazing.
Hopefully it is as good as everyone says.
I hope so too. I don't want to be disappointed.
I guess we will just have to wait and see.
We will have to watch it together.
