Did you ever see the Disney movie Blackbeard's Ghost?
No, I never saw that one. What's it about?
It's about a track coach who goes to a small town and stays at an old inn on the seashore that's haunted.
Really? Who stars in it?
Dean Jones plays as the coach and Peter Ustinov is the ghost of Blackbeard.
Oh, that sounds good. It's not scary is it?
No, it's a comedy. You know how some of the older Disney movies were really funny.
You're right they had some good ones.
No one has seen the ghost but he shows himself to the track coach and follows him around.
I'll have to try to find that and watch it.
