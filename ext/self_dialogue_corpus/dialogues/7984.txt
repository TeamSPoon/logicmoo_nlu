Which is your favorite pop band?
Probably One Direction.
Yeah, they have a lot of good songs.
They do, and not bad to look at either.
What Makes You Beautiful is a very good song.
It is.
Sad they started going separate ways.
One Thing was another favorite song of mine.
That was good.
Those guys have talent.
