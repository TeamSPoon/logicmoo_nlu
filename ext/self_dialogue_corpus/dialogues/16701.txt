Are you going to a music festival this summer?
Yes, I'm going to attend Pitchfork Music Festival with some people.
Oh wow, who's on the line up this year?
I can't remember all of the bands, but LCD Soundsystem is headlining, along with Broken Social Scene and the Dirty Projectors
Oh wow, LCD Soundsystem! I haven't seen them since their "final" show at Madison Square Garden!
This will be my first time seeing them, so I'm very excited!
You're in for a treat! They're incredible live, like MIND blowing.
What do you think about the reunion?
I thought it was a bit cheap at first, but I'm just glad that more people get to see and hear this incredible band!
Right on! What about you, are you going to a festival?
I just bought a house, so money is tight this summer. However, I'm going to drive to Chicago in September to see the last day of Riot Fest because Jawbreaker is playing
Jawbreaker? Never heard of them.
They're a punk/emo band from the 90s. They're from the San Francisco Bay Area sound, they played shows with Green Day and Nirvana back in the day, but broke up after signing to a major label.
What happened? Why weren't they huge like NOFX or Rancid?
They signed to a major label and received a ton of backlash for being "sellouts." Their record 'Dear You' was a critical and commercial failure, but many people still adored it and the band. They've become a bit of a cult sensation over the last few decades.
Wow, that sounds interesting. Maybe I should check them out sometime soon. Any recommendations?
If you were into punk in the 90s then you won't be disappointed! Pick up the aforementioned 'Dear You' or at least listen to the song "Boxcar" on YouTube.
Thanks, I'm pulling them up on Spotify right now.
Awesome! Hope you dig it and have fun at Pitchfork this year!
Yeah man, see you in the pit!
