Chance the Rapper is coming to Essence Fest this Sunday.
Oh, that's exciting are you going to see him?
I am. Though I've only listened to his most recent album.
You should go back and check out his first one
Is it as good.
It's better in my opinion.
Any other underrated rappers I should know about?
Sage the Gemini and Boldy James come to mind
I'll give them a listen.
Cymphonique is also going to be at Essence.
And Trombone shorty!
I've seen him at Jazz Fest. Who knew the trombone could be so sexy
There are a bunch of locals playing at Essence.
I saw that. I like the music from here.
Have you heard of The Essentials?
No. what kind of music are they?
It's just fun. They play at Maison a lot
Oh I've heard that.
There is a free show on Saturday.
Let's go listen to them!
