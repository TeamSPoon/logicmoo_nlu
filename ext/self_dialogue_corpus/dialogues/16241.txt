Are you listening to Queen? I love Freddie!
Yeah Freddie Mercury was awesome or should I call him Farrokh?
Farrokh??? why ??
Yeah his real name was Farrokh Bulsara, he was actually born in India and adopted the name Freddie.
I know he was the one naming Queen as the band name and was meant to shock and sound regal at the same time.
What's your favorite song from Queen?
Mine is Crazy little thing called love, fun fact...he composed it in a bath. Freddy got inspired by everything.
Yeah England got that one right, they are so proud they even honored the band by releasing a postage stamp in a commemorative gesture.
I would love to have one of those, I bet they are very rare these days.
Queen was an extraordinary singer, they don't make singers like him anymore. He was a know as a tenor but was actually a baritone.
Oh wow I did not know that one!! I knew his voice was amazing just not how amazing it was.
Queen as a band was amazing in so many levels. Plus they were graduated in many different areas, Brian was May studied astrophysics, Roger Taylor was trying to be a dentist and I know John Deacon was an Engineer in electronics.
Freddie was graduated in Arts if I'm not mistaken.
They were born to succeed. It was a terrible loss for music he day Freddie passed.
I was very young, didn't have the chance to see them live. Freddie died in 1991 and that was the end of it all. I would give anything to see a show with the whole band.
Yeah it was very sad, he left this world too early.
He left his boyfriend and his ex wife, both broken hearted.
Yeah who wouldn't be? Freddie had a very short but intense life.
At least he left us with that amazing collection of music that we can hear forever.
Bless him for that!
