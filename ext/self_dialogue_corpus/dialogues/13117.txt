Do you have a favourite Star Wars character?
Probably c3po. His sense of humor, and manner of speech are just so entertaining.
I went as him for halloween one year!
Oh man, I wish I could've seen that! Yeah as an asexual I find him really relateable.
But I thought you referred to some of the cast members as attractive.
Yeah aesthetically. Harrison Ford for example, he's another reason I liked watching them so much.
Ah I get it. Yeah I felt that way about Darth Vader, I had such a crush on him growing up.
I'm surprised you didn't go as him for Halloween.
Well, when cosplaying as Vader it would really be more about the clothes, mask and everything. I thought the character c3po lends itself well more to body paints and makeup type stuff.
That makes sense.
