Do you like to Karaoke?
I usually just listen to music. I don't like to sing it.
Oh come on. Haven't you ever sung in the shower.
No actually.
You got to try Karaoke sometime. Just let loose.
I am a terrible singer and would just make a fool of myself.
You know Karaoke is just about making a fool of yourself.
Still, no!
Alright. So I'm planning for us to go to a karaoke bar this weekend with some friends.
What!? No way I'm going.
I already rented a room and invited friends and told them you were coming.
You did not! You're kidding!
Yeah I'm kidding. But I really think you should at least try it.
What's the big deal.
I think if you're a bad singer, singing can be a fun way to get better and just have fun with friends.
I suppose.
And if you don't like it, I promise you can never sing again.
Okay, fine. If I don't like it, I'm going straight back to listening to music.
Sure, no problem. This saturday?
Fine.
