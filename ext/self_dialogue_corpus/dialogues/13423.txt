When was the last time you watched Star Wars.
It was when I saw Revenge of the Sith.
The Sith got their revenge.
The movie was very politically charged.
No one could agree on anything.
You would think a civilization that advanced would have eliminated war.
Not everyone was civilized.
Some of them were ugly.
Jabba the Hut was really ugly.
Yeah
