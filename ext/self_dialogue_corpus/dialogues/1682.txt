Have you been keeping up with the NFL in the off season?
Yes! What do you think about the Cowboys' new offensive tackle?
The kid from Arkansas? Skipper?
Yes! He is like 6′ 10″ I think? He is really going to help out our offensive line.
I think so too. I also like Taco Charlton from Michigan.
Was he our first draft pick?
Yes I think so. He is a defensive end I think.
We need him on defense for sure...we need something!
True! But, I think with Prescott at quarterback and the new picks, we will be a contender this year.
I don't know. We still are pretty young.
Yeah, but look at what Prescott did last year.
Yeah, but I still think the Falcons or the Steelers are going to take it this year.
Roethlisberger is getting some age on him though.
They got Dobbs from Tennessee.
He is so young though, and I really don't see him making an impact for a while.
True. I just don't know if Roethlisberger has another championship left in him.
Look at Brady though.
Yes, but that is Tom Brady though. He is a freak of nature.
Maybe, but I still think the Steelers will take it this year.
I guess we will see.
