I feel like going for a run, do you suggest a play list?
I dont have a playlist but I would suggest rock music for a run
Oh good idea, have any good songs?
oh yes, how about "running with the devil", "runnin down a dream", "eye of the tiger"
those are great, especially eye of the tiger, then I can feel like Rocky running down the street with the kids
I love that movie, do you listen to rock often?
I love it when I run, and when I sing in the shower
In the shower?
it makes me get motivated for my day
I could see that working, I will have to try that
