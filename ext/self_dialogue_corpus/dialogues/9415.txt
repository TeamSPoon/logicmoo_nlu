How would you rank Kanye West's albums?
Off the top of my head, I still think that College Dropout remains his greatest work.
Better than Late Registration?
I'd say so. Late Registration is good, but too top heavy. Aside from Diamonds from Sierra Leone and Gold Digger, the songs range between average and good.
Yeah, but College Dropout is also top heavy in terms of hits.
I disagree. While the album has tons of hits like Jesus Walks, Slow Jamz, and All Falls Down, the best songs on the album are the deep tracks like We Don't Care and Last Call.
Last Call is weird because it's a 3 minute song followed by 10 minute monologue.
Yeah, but it's interesting to hear Kanye talk about how he was able to get a record deal as a producer.
I'll have to listen to that track again. Anyways, what do you think of his newer work?
It's great. Life of Pablo is a well crafted album.
