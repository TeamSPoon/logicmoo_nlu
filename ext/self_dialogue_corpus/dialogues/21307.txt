Are you going to see Guardian's of the Galaxy 2?
Yes.  I can't wait.
Me neither.  It's by far the best thing Marvel has put out.
I agree.  Although Civil War was pretty good.
Yeah, but I don't like how many characters they tried to develop.  It felt too congested.
Fair enough.  Any idea what the critics are saying about Guardians 2?
Supposed to be not as good as the first one bus still got good scores.
Have you heard anything about the after credits scene?
No.  I'm trying to be surprised by it.
I hope it ties in with the next Thor movie and maybe even Spiderman.
it kind of seems like Marvel can do no wrong.
Yeah.  Too bad DC hasn't figured out the formula yet.
Right!  Suicide Squad and Batman V Superman were disappointing.
I give them credit for trying, but I'm not disagreeing.
Between Wonder Woman and Justice League they are skating on thin ice.
Exactly.  But, to be honest, I'm kind of getting tired of all these cinematic universe installments.
Me too, a little bit.  That's why I'm looking forward to Guardians.
Yeah, in hindsight I hope they hold off on tying in to avengers and Dr Strange for a while just to keep it self-sustaining.
Oh, I forgot about Dr. Strange.  That's right up there with Guardians as far as I'm concerned.
Like you said, Marvel can do no wrong.
