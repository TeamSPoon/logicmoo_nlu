What city is the hotbed of the indie scene right now?
Music has evolved passed just having cities be the hotbed.
So like a Seattle in the 90s could never happen?
Yeah I think with the internet we are all connected.
Philly punk was good for a long time.
And Chicago hardcore held its own.
I always associate the hardcore music scene with Long Island.
Did you like the band Glassjaw.
Yeah I think they were pioneers in their scene.
Its a shame they broke up.
Well the singer came down with a bad disease.
Their first album was my teenage anthem.
I always thought Blink 182 wrote the songs for my childhood.
I cant believe they are still a band
Well Matt Skiba from Alkaline Trio is singing for them now
He doesnt have the voice Tom DeLonge did.
Yeah and no one would, thats what makes Blink so iconic
I just think his voice doesnt suit the band.
It does, its just hard to admit it.
Well Tom probably wont ever go back to the band nor should he
