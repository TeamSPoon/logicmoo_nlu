Have you seen any good movies lately?
I haven't seen any movies since I saw Star Wars.
Well, there have been 7 or 8 Star Wars movies, depending on how you count them. Which one are you talking about?
I saw Rogue One. It was the most recent Star Wars movie.
How was it?
I liked it. I thought it stayed pretty true to what George Lucas had set up for Star Wars.
Oh, so you're a big Star Wars fan then?
I wouldn't say I'm one of those die-hard fans. Die-hard fans have been into Star Wars since the first three movies in the '80s.
So the first three Star Wars movies came out in the '80s?
Well, yes and no. The '80s, and the end of the '70s, is when episodes 4,5 and 6 were really popular.
So when were episodes 1, 2 and 3 in theatres?
Those actually came out after 4,5, and 6.
Why did 4,5 and 6 come out first?
George Lucas used a theatrical approach derived from the literary approach of in medias res.
What does that mean? How does that work?
That means "in the middle of things". It's an old story technique used to get the person involved in the action from the very beginning of the story.
What about Star Trek movies? What makes someone decide to use In Medias Res?
Star Trek movies actually came out in response to the popularity of the orginal T.V. series. So viewers were already kind of involved.
Was there anything that the Star Wars movie franchise was based on before it started?
It all came from the mind of George Lucas, originally. There was no TV show before it or anything like that.
