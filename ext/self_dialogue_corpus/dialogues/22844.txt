What's your favorite Christopher Nolan movie?
I'm a huge Nolan fan so this is a tough question. Let me think about this for a second, what's your favorite?
If I had to rank them, my order would be The Dark Knight, Interstellar, Inception, The Prestige, Memento, Batman Begins, The Dark Knight Rises.
Now that I've had a little time to think about it I think my all time favorite Nolan movie would have to be The Dark Knight and Inception. I like Interstellar next and everything else is sort of in the same category for me.
I'm looking forward to Dunkirk. That's going to be releasing soon!
I know! I've already reserved a day to watch it when it releases.
Tom Hardy is going to be in Dunkirk right?
Yeah, Tom Hardy is going to be in there. It'll be his second movie I think under Nolan's direction.
That's right, the other was Inception.
Did you ever figure out if the top stopped spinning or not in Inception?
No! That's the never ending question. I think I've had endless debates with people over that ending.
I know, was it a dream or not?
My head slightly hurts thinking about it again now, so I'll just stick to what I originally thought, it's not a dream. Makes me feel good knowing it was more fulfilling.
I won't argue with you on that. What did you think about the extra dimension in Interstellar?
That turn or twist really surprised me! It was so revealing and I remember being so pleasantly shocked and surprised by it!
That movie really brought out the melodramatics but I enjoyed it.
I agree, it had a strong sense of love.
Oh, the Anne Hathaway love monologue was a little corny I thought.
It wasn't that bad! I know people are cynical today, but I thought it was fitting for the situation they were in.
I can see that. I sort of agree it does fit the overall theme and message of the movie.
