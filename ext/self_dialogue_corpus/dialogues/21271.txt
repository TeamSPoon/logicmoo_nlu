Have you seen any good movies lately?
Ya i recently saw 'Get Out'
Oh ya me too, what did you think?
I thought it was great. how did you like it?
I thought it was okay, a little overrated
What do you mean?
It got a 99% rotten tomatoes score. Dont think it was that good.
I think it deserves it. The movie had lots of thrill
Yea it was exciting to watch but not a very strong plot line
I see. It does fit with current social issues though
Yea i think thats why it was so popular. Lots of current racial issues
I cant beleive they made another fast and furious...
I know its ridicuous!
I have no clue why people still watch them
I agree. They all are so similar and the plotlines are so boring
They will just keep making them if people keep going to them
I hope this one was their last one
It probably will be
Why do you say that?
Their sales for this one were much lower than their last one
