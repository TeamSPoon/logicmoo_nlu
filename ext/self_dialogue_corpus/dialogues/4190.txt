Have you seen any thriller movies lately?
Yes, I did see that new movie Life with Jake Gyllenhaal and Ryan Reynolds.
Oh, I wanted to see that one.  How was it?
I expected it to be a lot better, it wasn't even Jake Gyllenhaal's best work.  I hate Noctural Animals as well but at least he acted his heart out in it.
Nocturnal Animals WAS a weird movie.  What didn't you like about Life?
It felt like it dragged on, and then the ending became predictable about halfway thought the movie.
I hate when I can guess the movie endings, I love being surprised.
If you like being suprised you should watch some M. Night Shyamalan movies.
Which one do you recommend?
His older ones were great like Sixth Sense and The Village, but he recently made a new one called Split which was very popular.
