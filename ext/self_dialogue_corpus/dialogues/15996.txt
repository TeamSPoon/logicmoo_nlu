Hey Jon how are things?
Not too bad just getting my playlist together for my workout
Oh nice, what kind of music do you like?
I typically listen to a lot of metalcore and screamo but pretty much anything can go in my playlist
do you have any non metal on your phone?
Yes I  have some old 90s rap
Wow, like NWA?
Yes I have NWA and Ice Tea and Ice Cube and a lot of Dr DRE
Ice Tea sounds like a drink
(chuckles) well I guess it does but he actually had a hit called "New Jack Hustle"
Was that from the movie "New Jack City"?
Yes it was, he is also in some cop show on TV
Cool, so what else do you have on the phone?
I have a lot of Smashing PUmpkins and some Silverchair
What about Pearl Jam and Nirvana?
Of course, i'm a child of the 90's so why would I not have some good old fashioned Grunge music.
Shame about Soundgardens lead singer Chris Cornell
Yup he was great as well
A lot of the 90's grunge singers seem to have passed away recently
I know, Kurt Cobain, Lain Stanley even Chris Cornell its a damn shame.
