I really want to see the movie Get Him to the Greek again!
That movie is really one of my favorites.
What is your favorite part of the movie?
I really think think the part where they stroke the walls is funny!
Oh man me too! Doesn't Hill get hit in the face with a pool ball around that part?
Yes! I totally forgot about that!
It is one of my favorite scenes of any movie.
I think so too. The music is really great in it.
It is really dirty, but it is extremely funny.
I didn't notice the music as much until I watched it as an adult.
Yeah. I was the same way.
Do you remember that part that ripped off Pulp Fiction?
Oh yes! He wakes up like "I'm ALIVE!"
I think that is the part that you liked with the pool ball.
You are right! When did that movie even come out?
It came out in 2010.
I can't believe it has been that long ago.
I know. Who is the british guy in that movie?
Russell Brand. He is one of my favorite comedians.
Yeah! I can't ever remember his name though.
