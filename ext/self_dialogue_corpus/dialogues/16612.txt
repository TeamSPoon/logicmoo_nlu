Country definitely. Who do you like?
Alicia Keyes
I like lake byran
He has good music
I went to a concert of his once, loved it.
It sounds like it would be fun
I'm hoping to go to a blake Shelton concert soon
Maybe youll see gwen, I hope Alicia Keyes does a tour soon
I think I heard she wants to
I hope so, that would be amazing.
I think I heard that's why she wants to leave the voice, to focus on her music
She needs to, she's so talented.
She is good, I love her new song.
I really like when she plays the piano and sings
Shes great at both
It's amazing to watch
