Do you listen to country music?
Yes!
Do you like Keith Urban?
Yes, he is good.
I think he is so hot!
Me too!
I wish I was Nicole Kidman.
No kidding she has got it made.
They seem to be so in love.
I get that same feeling when I see them together.
I love his song Blue Ain't Your Color!
I do too.
Keith is like the bad boy of country music. What do you think?
Yes, he is.  He wears some tight jeans and those fitted T shirts.
They do look good on him.
He has a more of a rock vibe to his style than country.
I would say he's pretty edgy in that sense.
Yes but I'd like to be on that edge with him.
I think his accent is so sexy.
I think all the guys from down under sound sexy.
