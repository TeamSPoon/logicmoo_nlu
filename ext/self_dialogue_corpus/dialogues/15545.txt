Hey Billy, What are you up to?
I'm trying to add new songs to my itunes.
Yeah I heard Itunes has really changed.
yeah now you have to really like the entire album before making a purchase otherwise its not worth it-- to pay all that money just for one song!
Wow.. I didnt know that.
Anyway, which album or song are you gonna purchase.
Imagine Dragons
Hey I just saw a tv commercial by them
A TV commercial??
Yeah!
Thats' odd to see a tv commercial by a band
Yeah it was in co-operation with spotify-- I guess to drum up more sales
Wow.. but IS the album good?
Yes its excellent--- one of the best I've heard this year 2017
What is one song that you really like from it?
Believer
Dont you mean Belieber?
HAHA thats not funny!
I think I will download the Imagine Dragons album also since you recommend it
yeah do it bro!
