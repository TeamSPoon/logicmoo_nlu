My favorite part of Awards Season is the fashion!
I love the intresting looks that stars wear to the Met Gala.
Yes! This years Gala was full of designs by Kawakubo.
And every year since Anna Wintour's first year as Met Gala chair in 1995, the event has featured honorary hosts from the worlds of entertainment and fashion.
Did you know that this year's co-chairs are Katy Perry, Pharrell Williams, Tom Brady and Gisele Bündchen?
No, but I loved Katy Perry's outfit in May's Vogue in honor of the upcoming gala.
Kawakubo, is a 74-year-old Japanese designer who founded Comme des Garçons in 1969, is only the second living designer honored by the Costume Institute, along with Saint Laurent.
She has defined the aesthetics of our time, by inviting us to rethink fashion as a site of constant creation, recreation, and hybridity,
A-listers and top designers bring out their most impressive, over-the-top and memorable outfits for the red carpet.
I loved Sarah Jessica Parkers look!
Sarah Jessica Parker has been a top fashionista ever since her role as Carrie Bradshaw on Sex in the City.
Yes, without her influence, I might never have known how great Manolo Blahnik shoes were!
President Trump proposed to Melania during the Met Gala in 2004.
Yes, it is definitely a high profile event. I loved Melania's dress that night.
Taylor Swift and Tom Hiddleston's romance was borne of their Met Gala dance-off in 2016. She looked spectacular.
Yes, and his suit was so dapper.
Historically, guests are also supposed to dress in the fashions of the gala's honored designer, a tradition that often turns controversial.
The Kardashian sisters love to stir up controversy at the Gala. Especially Kim!
Did you see the Olsen twins outfits?
Yes, straight vintage! I'm not a fan of vintage, but they definitely pulled it off!
