Have you heard about the lousy box office turn out for King Arthur the Legend of the Sword?
I heard it was really poor.  I wonder if the movie's really that bad.
What did you think of Alien: Covenant?
It was good but it can't touch how good the original was...
My girlfriend dragged me to see Snatched.  It wasn't terrible.
So it made you laugh a bit huh?  At least you have a good attitude about it.
I want to see the latest of the Guardians of The Galaxy.
You mean Volume 2?  If so, I would if you like the last one.
I can't believe a movie about Baywatch is coming out...
It already has but I haven't seen any reviews.  I have my doubts...
How many Fast and Furious sequels can they possibly make?
I know, it's crazy.  I think they're on number seven...
So, what's the best movie you have seen in 2017?
I think it was actually released in 2016 but I didn't watch it until 2017.  I'm going with Hacksaw Ridge... So far...
There's another sniper movie out called The Wall.
I'm not sure I'm up for that.  It has John Cena in it.  I'll wait for the reviews.
I heard Tom Hanks' new movie The Circle bombed at the box office.
Yeah, I heard that too.  That's got to be a first for Tom Hanks.
Have you heard of this movie Lowriders.  Do you know what it is about?
I think it's about a guy that's a street artist that's into the LA low rider car scene.
