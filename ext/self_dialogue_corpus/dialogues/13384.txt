What did you think of Jabba the Hutt as a villain?
Oh he was excellent. I really liked the whole concept of the bounty hunters being involved.
They really are a big part of the Star Wars universe that you don't always think about.
Yeah, I mean Boba Fett is one of the most iconic characters in these movies and he barely had any screen time!
I wonder if Captain Phasma from The Force Awakens will end up with the same sort of cult following.
It's hard to say. Kind of depends on what they do with her.
I like that they used Gwendoline Christie from Game of Thrones. Adds an extra nerdy fandom element in there that makes me happy.
Yeah she's a great actress. I hope we get to see her face a little. But knowing how Star Wars works, we may not.
That's true. Also another character I liked a lot was General Hux.
I think he might be a huge first order baddie in the upcoming movie. They better give him a big role!
