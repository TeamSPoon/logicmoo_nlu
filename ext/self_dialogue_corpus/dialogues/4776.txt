Who's the best pitcher in the league right now?
Kershaw. He's the greatest pitcher of our generation.
What about Scherzer?
He's in the top 5, but Kershaw is in a league of his own.
I agree. He's worth 10 wins per season by himself.
The only fault against him is injuries.
I know, but long term I think his arm and delivery are made to hold up late into his career.
Yeah, he's not really a power pitcher who relies on velocity.
Do you think he's more valuable than Trout?
A think a pitcher normally is, and I'd take Kershaw over any other hitter in the league, but not Trout.
Trout has to be the most valuable player in baseball
I agree. Mostly because of his age and the fact that he's not even peaked yet.
He could go on another 12 years doing what he's doing.
So you'd take Kershaw over Bryce Harper?
Definitely. Harper is inconsistent and susceptible to injuries.
After Harper's terrible season in 2016, I don't know if I could trust him on a 7-10 year contract.
Yeah, it's like he turns it on when he wants to.
With Trout, you know what production you're getting every year.
So the top two players in the game are Trout and Kershaw.
They're the most valuable right now.
