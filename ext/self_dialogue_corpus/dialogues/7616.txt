Have you seen all of the Harry Potter movies?
Yes, I like all of them except for The Chamber of Secrets
Me too, my favorite is The Order of the Phoenix.
Yea, I like the secret house they use in London.
It's funny when they all take the polyjuice potion to look like Harry.
Yes! I forget which movie that is in, I also like the Weasley's House.
Yea, I like the clock that Mrs. Weasley uses to keep track of everyone.
And the spells she uses for the dishes to clean themselves.
Also the flying car is cool!
Yea, I like that it lives in the Forbidden forest.
