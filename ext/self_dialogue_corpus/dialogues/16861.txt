Who do you think is the most influential artist of all time?
Hmmm, I would have to say either Elvis or the Beatles, just given how popular and how much impact they had.
Which one do you like better?
Definitely the Beatles.  I couldn't name but a handful of Elvis songs.
Agreed.  I like Elvis, and respect what he's done, but there's no comparison to the Beatles.
Ok-- The Beatles, or Rolling Stones?
As much as I love the Stones, you just can't compare to the Beatles.
I have to agree with that.  What is your favorite Beatles' song?
I don't think I could pick just one-- there are too many good ones.
Have you ever heard of Silver?
No.
I've been really into one of their songs recently.  It's called Wham Bam Shang a Lang.
Sounds funky.
It is sooooo catchy, and it was on the Guardians soundtrack.
Speaking of good soundtracks, you ever heard of Terrance Trent D'arby?
Yeah.
He did the theme for Beverly Hills Cop 3.  It's called Right Thing, Wrong Way.  I've been listening to that on repeat.
I'll have to check that out.
Ok, so which artist was the most influential on you personally?
I'd probably say Led Zeppelin.  I loved Robert Plant-- I even grew out my hair and dyed it blonde.
