I just watched  Inglourious Basterds the other day. What a great movie!
I haven't seen it. what is it about?
It is set in WWII and its about a plan to assassinate Nazi leaders.
Wow, sounds good. Who is in it?
Brad Pitt has the lead role.
I think Brad Pitt is such a great action hero. He was great in World War Z.
I liked World War Z a lot too.
Have you ever seen Snatch?
I have, that is one of my favorite movies of all time.
Me too. I could watch Snatch over and over and not get tired of it.
