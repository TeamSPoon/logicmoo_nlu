Man, k-pop is pretty weird.
What's k-pop?
It's Korean pop music, and I think I'm going a little crazy watching these music videos.
Oh man, if they're anything like Japanese animation videos, I know what you mean.
They're not, they're a lot different and feature hot girls in cartoon bubblegum lands dancing around.
That sounds fine to me. What's the music like?
K-pop is like pop on steroids, and it sounds like it's made in a computer.
So why have singers at all?
Because the "singers" are really just dancers and make your heart flutter.
Maybe all music should be like k-pop then.
Definitely not, I think the world would go crazy.
Have a favorite k-pop group or song?
Fantastic Baby by BigBang is really cool. It's a story about the start of the universe.
I thought they would just sing about love and happiness and stuff.
No, k-pop can be pretty heady stuff sometimes. That's what I mean when I say I'm going crazy.
Well don't go too crazy! You need to be sane for when I show you my favorite music.
I don't even want to know.
It's k-metal. It's hot Korean girls playing heavy metal with giant wigs.
I don't know if I believe you, but that sounds great.
Yeah, let's check it out, I have it on my computer here.
