Have you ever read a book and then watched the movie adaptation?
Yeah, I've watched a few.
Which ones?
Let me see... Great Expectations, Romeo + Juliet, Perks of Being a Wallflower, 1984, Clockwork Orange, and Atlas Shrugged, to name a few.
Which one do you think was most like the book?
Well, Romeo + Juliet was basically verbatim, but of course the scenery was modern. Perks of Being a Wallflower did a really good job, too.
Which one was the worst?
Great Expectations. I liked the movie itself, but it really differed from the book. For some reason they even changed the names of the main characters.
That's strange. What did they change them to?
They changed Pip's name to Finn and Miss Havisham to Mrs. Dinsmoor.
I wonder why they did that?
I don't know--artistic license, I guess. Like I said, the movie was good, though. The soundtrack was excellent.
What year was it released?
1998.
Oh yeah, that was a pretty good era for film and soundtracks.
Most definitely.
So, what book do you wish they'd make a movie about?
It's pretty obscure, but I wish they would adapt Poppy Z. Brite's Lost Souls.
Oh, the one about gay punk vampires?
Yeah, that's the one. I think it'd be great on screen.
