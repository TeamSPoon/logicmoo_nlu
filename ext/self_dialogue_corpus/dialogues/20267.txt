HAVE YOU SEEN "FLORENCE"
NO I HAVEN'T
IT IS A TRUE STORY ABOUT A RICH WOMAN IN NEW YORK
I THINK MERYL STREEP IS IN IT
YES SHE IS
SHE IS AMERICA'S BEST ACTRESS
SHE COULDN'T SING BUT SHE WANTED TO BE A SINGER
IT SOUNDS BORING
IT DOES BUT IT WASN'T
HOW DID IT END
SHE HAD A RICH HUSBAND WHO PAID FOR HER SINGING DEBATE IN CARNEGIE HALL IN NEW YORK
HE MUST OF BEEN LOADED
AT THE END OF THE MOVIE SHE DIED
IT MUST OF BEEN SAD
DID YOU SEE "ST VINCENT"
yes i did
Melissa  MCCARTHY WAS IN IT
IT WAS ENTERTAINING AND TRUE TO LIFE
MY ALL TIME FAVORITE MOVIE " WAS GONE WITH THE WIND"
THERE IS A LITTLE BIT OF SCARLET O HARA IN ALL OF US
