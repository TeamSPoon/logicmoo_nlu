Do you like The Killers?
I like a lot of their songs.
Have your heard their new song, The Man.
Yes, I just listened to it today.
What did you think.
It was okay. I am not sure that I liked it as much as their last album.
I feel the same way, but it was a good teaser for their upcoming albu.
What is that going to be called?
Wonderful, Wonderful.
I might check it out, when it is released.
