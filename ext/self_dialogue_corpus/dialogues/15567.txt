Have you heard the latest song from Thomas Rhett?
Who is Thomas Rhett?
He's a country pop singer, started to become popular in 2013.
Did he make an album or stay with a single?
His first was a single called "It goes like this". After that single, he was pretty low-key for a while.
What's his newest song called? Maybe I have and I just don't realize who sings it.
It's called "Craving You". It seems to have a different tone than some of his others... its more softer.
Ohh wait, is that the guy that sings "My t-shirt, right there, your hair messed up like Guns'N'Roses?
Yea, thats the guy. Thats actually my favorite song. The dude just got married and is adopting while his wife is expecting too.. I think that's kind of cool.
Have you ever heard him play on stage?
No, I always seem the miss the shows when he is local to me. He was at the Country 500 but I was out of town at a wedding.
Isnt that the big festival where he played, along with Blake Shelton, Miranda, etc?
Yep, sure is. 3 days festival full of great musicians. I would have loved to go.
Do you remember your first concert? I barely remember mine.
My first concert was some sort of Christian show with my youth group, but my first real experience was seeing Alan Jackson at the Delaware State fair.
I remember seeing Alan with my parents too!
I also remember seeing Shania Twain. She was in Greenville a while back but again, I couldn't go.
I managed to score tickets to the SC State fair and was able to meet Jake Owen before he was popular. It was back when he first produced Barefoot Bluejean night, so its been a few years.
Yea, I remember that song. He's now become a regular artist. It's insane how fast their singles catch on, sometimes.
I also remember meeting Eli Young Band at that show. I wonder if they are still around.. its only been about 3-4 years.
