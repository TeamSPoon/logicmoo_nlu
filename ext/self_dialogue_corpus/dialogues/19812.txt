Jake! How's it going bud, what are you listening to?
Just going for a jog, I like to get some 50 cent in the bloodstream.
50 cent, you didn't strike me as the gangster rapper type.
I get that a lot, but 50 is one of my favorite artists.
To tell you the truth, I love the guy's style too!
Really, you got any favorite songs?
Oh for sure, I love his first album so much, the song Heat changed my life.
Oh man, Heat is an incredible track!
It is so vicious with the lyrics and drums, I love what Dr. Dre did on that one.
The combination of Eminem and Dr. Dre everywhere on that album truly made it a classic.
I completely agree, I love all those artists the same!
The early 2000s Aftermath production team was just off the wall!
Maybe the best hip hop dynamic of all time?
I can see that, the East Coast, West Coast and even the Midwest were covered with the label.
There was a lot of diversity with Aftermath and nobody slouched on their verses.
You could tell Dr. Dre made those guys rehearse to perfection.
Oh yeah, that is why we got perfect albums from them!
I didn't know you knew so much about hip hop.
I just got excited when you said you loved 50 Cent!
That is awesome, I'm gonna go jam now!
