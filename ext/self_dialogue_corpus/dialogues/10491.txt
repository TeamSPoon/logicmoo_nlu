Hi there! How's it going?
I'm pretty good, how about you?
Great! I've had the last couple days off from work.
That's awesome, have you been up to anything fun?
My boyfriend and I went to a concert last week in the city.
Oh, cool. Which one?
We saw Adele live. It was amazing.
Wow, that's awesome, I heard she's not going to be touring much anymore.
I know! We had a chance to get the tickets, and couldn't pass it up.
Were the seats expensive?
Ummm, we probably paid more than we should have.
Good seats though?
Yes, definitely! About 10 rows back from the front.
I'm so jealous! Did she sing "Hello"?
Yes! Pretty much all of her songs that you've heard on the radio, and some new stuff that I didn't recognize.
That sounds so cool. I wish I could've gone too!
Are there any concerts you wanted to see this summer?
I'm big into country music, so maybe one of those tours when they come to town.
That'd be awesome, you should let me know if you're going to buy tickets!
Will do! It was great catching up with you!
