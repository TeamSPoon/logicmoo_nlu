Hey I just saw Deadpool at AMC ...It was really amazing dude
Yeah I heard that too ...was it a typical marvel piece ?
not at all bro .Way better than that
Oh cool ...so tell me more about the movie ..what makes it so special
Well it has a lot of actions and good vfx ..but that's not what made it so cool
ok so what made it so cool ?
i think the movie has fantastic dark humor ..that's probably what makes it so cool
yeh that makes sense ..but I heard it's a little gross violent
Well that's true .But kept it under limits
Oh I see ..so did you watch it in 3d ?
Yep in Full 3d ...made it even more exciting
cool cool ..I am so happy for you man ..so which AMC did you go to ?
