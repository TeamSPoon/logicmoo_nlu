Say whatever happened to Tim Tebow?
I think he went and tried out baseball
Oh, how is he doing on that?
I really have no idea
So what are your predictions on which teams are going to be on top this year
I think it's going to be Pats, Ravens, Colts, Chiefs on the AFC
I agree, that sounds about right
For the NFC, I think Eagles, Packers, Panthers and Seahawks
Really, I disagree about the Eagles, I think it's going to be the Giants.
Maybe, way to early to tell though
Who do you think might end up being MVP
I have no clue, a few good quarterbacks to chose from, anyone can surprise you
It just better not be Brady, I am so sick of hearing his name
I 100% agree
How long do you think Mike Mcarthey will be coaching
I don't know, seems like he has been coaching the Pack forever
I hope he stays, he is a good coach
So do I
What about Ted Thompson
He has been around ever since I started watching the Pack many years ago. I don't know if he should stay or go.
