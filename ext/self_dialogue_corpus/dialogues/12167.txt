What do you think of Han Solo?
In the old movies or in the newer ones?
What's the difference?
Well he is a lot older when he fights with Rey, he was young before
I guess I like him more in the older movies
Why do you say that?
He was funnier and cuter!
My mom thinks he is still cute! That's so funny!
I think he was sassier and more sarcastic in the older ones
Oh, I dont really like that, personally!
