Have you seen Goldfinger?
Yes, the best of the Bond Movies.
I know.  Had the best Bond for sure.
And the best bad guy too, with the hat.
The way he threw that and took out the statue was awesome.
And he killed people with it.
I also like that part where gold finger covered that girl in gold.
Yes, and the best Bond girl name by a long shot.
At least the funniest, Pussy Galour.
One of the most well known lines.
When he says "Goldfinger, do you expect me to talk?"
"No Mr. Bond, I expect you to die!"
How about when he defuses the a-bomb
Actually it's Q that does that, by flipping a switch.
Still an awesome part though.
Yeah, it stops on 007!
Only Bond.  Of course no one will hold a candle to Sea Connery.
Yeah, Danial Craig has been pretty good.  Not as good but pretty good.
I like the grit he brings.
Yeah, Craig may not be the best but he is the toughest.
