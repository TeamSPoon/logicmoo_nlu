Almost time!!! Are you ready for some football!
oh heck yeah! I can't wait!
I'm so ready ! The first game is KC at NE on Thursday night!
I'm pulling for my Chiefs!
Me too. Gronk will be back in full form, so that worries me.
Yeah, but who do they have running the ball? Blount left for Philly.
Heck, It doesn't matter! With Brady they might throw the ball he first 20 plays!
That's true too. They've done it before.
I know Belicheck's record on opening day is great, But so is our boy Andy Reid!
Yes sir. He's great on opening week and coming off byes.
Outstanding. He will have a great game plan!
And if it is a loss, I'd rather go ahead and get it out of the way.
And we will have extra time to get ready for week 2
Yeah, Our first time on opening night.
And do you remember what happened the last time KC opened up at NE?
Oh yes. Brady broke knee and out the rest of the year. NE still went 11-5 with Matt Cassell.
I don't want to hurt Brady, but I want that win bad!!
Well, if lose, maybe we can beat them in January!!
I can't think of anything better!! Winning the AFC Championship in New England!
The only thing better would be winning it at home at Arrowhead. I just can't wait!!!
