Heard any rap music lately?
I have heard a lot of stuff by Biggie Smalls.
What song is your favorite?
Big Poppa. That is classic.
I agree. I like all of his albums really.
Me too. He was my favorite rap artist.
I think Diddy did a great job producing his songs.
He definitely did.
Maybe his son will start an album of his own.
That would be nice.
