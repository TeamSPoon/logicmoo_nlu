Do you think Madonna will continue her career?
No I think she is getting too old.
She has spanned almost 4 decades now.
And really since Material Girl what has she done?
She had the breakout song on the Austin Powers soundtrack.
That was even 20 years ago.
I still think Like a Prayer was her best song.
I loved the video.
She was the first controversy before they were big.
So she was just like a Kardashian!
