I was and still am a huge fan of Twista.
He was a rapper?
Yes he rapped really fast. So fast you almost couldn't understand him.
Right I do remember him now!
My favorite song of his was "Slow Jamz."
That was a great song.
Yes it was. It came out my junior year in high school.
I listened to his CD all the time.
He is definitely original.
Oh yes he is, you don't hear rappers like that today.
