Tom Brady got one more in him.
Even though we dont have Marshawn they are still strong offensive
But now they don't have any running game
Someone will pick up his spot
We might be getting old but we have experience.
But with youth  you get the hunger
But you might do something foolish to lose the game
And we have the speed to correct
Well is there any other team that might make it to the big show
North Carolinian panther might have a shot.
Ya they did look good but will they learn from there mistakes
I think they will
How about the cowboys
They had a good run but failed with injures
Well if everyone is healthy I think they might have a shot.
That is true but I like the seahawks
Well I think a repeat with the patriots
There too old
Well the seahawks got no running game
Ya but we got youth
