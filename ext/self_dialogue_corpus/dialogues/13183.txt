I just saw The Force Awakens.
Who directed it?
J.J. Abrams, the Star Trek movie director.
Cool.  Who was your favorite in the movie?
Carrie Fisher, in her last role.  She still looked good.
How about Rey?
Daisy Ridley?  She was magnificent.
I liked Kylo Ren.
Sad what happens to Han Solo.
Mark Hamill looked super old.
