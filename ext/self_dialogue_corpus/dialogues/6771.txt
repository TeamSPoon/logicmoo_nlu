It is weird to think of disney in terms of Star Wars , I always think of lucas studios.
Ya it is a little weird. You think disney you think animation first.
Yes like snow white, cinderella etc.
True. But as for disney's Star Wars movie I think they are really doing a great job.
I agree with you, Disney may have been more successful than the epsiode one 2000's set of star wars films.
Oh for sure, in terms of quality.
They went back to what people really loved. Such as storm tropers in suits not cgi.
Disney made the right call on that one for sure!
I guess I need to start connecting Disney more to Star wars, I am sure with more and more movies being put out by them won't be hard.
I think that is very true. You know disney is going to keep pumping them out.
