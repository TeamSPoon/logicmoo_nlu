So where do you find the hip hop artists you listen to?
Well it depends. The first PE song I heard was in a movie.
Which one?
The movie was something with Adam Sandler. The song was Give it Up.
And you liked it?
I thought it wasn't bad, so I wanted to check out their other stuff. If I'd never seen that movie I still might not know who they are today.
Awesome! And from there?
From there I see who they've been affiliated with. I've also discovered new artists just by doing a vague youtube search.
Find any good ones that way?
I've found a handful, two of which have become some of my favourites. Terawrizt and Trigger.
