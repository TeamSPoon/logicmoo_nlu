I haven't seen all of them.  I guess I should.
Well, It's hard to beat the original.
I agree.  I think they got a little carried away with all the sequels.
They did.  Some of them are good.  But I like the ones with Paul Walker and Vin Diesel the best.
Yeah.  Aren't there like six or seven?
Yep.  And they are planning more.  Without Paul Walker I just don't think they will be the same.
No, he just made the movies what they were.
Vin Diesel can't be replaced either.  If you lose both of those characters, I really don't think you will have much of a fan base.
Hopefully he will be included in the new ones.  I'd love to see him have more of a presence.
Yeah, I might actually make an effort to watch them then.
