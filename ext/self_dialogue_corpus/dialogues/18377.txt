what movie soundtrack did you enjoy and buy?
Back in the day I was super into the clueless soundtrack.
I had the cd.
I loved kids in america.
That became a big anthem type song for me and my friends.
ya true, probably for most kids in america..
ha. I never liked fake plastic trees though.
why? that is a great song?
I think it was a little too boring and slow for my teenage tastes.
Do you like it now?
I don't truly enjoy it.
I am mindvlown! Do you like Radiohead?
I love most radiohead, ok computer is a great album.
It may be my favorite album but does not have my favorite song by them.
And pray tell what is it?
Creep!
That is one of the ultimate songs from Radiohead.
It is such a hauntingly beautiful melody and lyrics.
I have always been a fan of that song.
It is much better that fake plastic trees.
