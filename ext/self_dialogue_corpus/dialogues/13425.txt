Do you think the path of Darth Vader would be different if he had known that his children had survived?
I think that wasn't the possibility, as it was intentionally kept from him.
But doesn't the fact that it was kept from him suggest that it could have influenced him?
I don't think that it would have brought him back into the Light side again. He was already too far gone.
But it seemed that his attitude changed after he met Luke and realized that he was his son.
I don't think so. He was still trying to corrupt Luke and bring him into the Dark Side.
So you believe that his affection towards Luke didn't really affect the level of his corruption?
The only thing that got Darth Vader to react was when the Emperor attacked Luke.
But that suggests that his priorities might have changed.
True. He was still dark, but the act of giving up his life for his son redeemed him in a way.
