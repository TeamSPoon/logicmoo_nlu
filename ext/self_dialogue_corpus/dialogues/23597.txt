Have you ever seen any of the X-Men films?
I've seen them all! X2 is still my favorite.
I can't disagree with that. That was easily the first really good superhero team movie.
True that. And all the characters had such great personalities that made them unique.
I feel like Days of Future past is a close contender.
Absolutely. Everything about that movie was outstanding. The extended version is even better!
That's the one with all the deleted Rogue scenes, right.
That's the one! It really adds a whole new, interesting layer to the movie.
That's cool. I've only ever seen the theatrical cut, so I'll definitely have to check that out.
How about the Wolverine movies? What do you think of those?
I didn't like Origins all that much. I thought it was pretty lackluster.
I agree. What about the other 2.
The Wolverine was great. Logan was fantastic.
One-hundred percent agreed on Logan. That might just be one of the best superhero movies of the last decade.
You know what? I'd be willing to push X2 out of the way for Logan.
I don't know if that's the case for me. I like them both too much.
It's all up to you.
You're right. I'll keep them both tied for first place!
Good call!
Thank you!
