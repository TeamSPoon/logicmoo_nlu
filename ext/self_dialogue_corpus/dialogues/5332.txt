Have you seen Big Hero 6 Yet?
Not sure, which one is that about?
It's about a boy who's brother's science project helps him and his friends bring his brother's killer to justice.
Sounds pretty intense.
It is a really good movie.
I will have to check it out.
I like it a lot. There are some funny characters like Fred who is voiced by TJ Miller.
That guy is pretty funny in a lot of his movies.
I think the best part of the movie is the character Baymax.
I will have to watch that movie to see for myself.
