Hey, have you seen the latest Star Wars movie lately?
Not yet, I knew it came out the other week, so I have just been working too much as usual!
It looks very fun, I know it came out last year but it is showing again at the theater this weekend.
Really, what was the movie theater?
Regal Cinemas is showing it .
Great, I want to go see it with you.
That would be fun!
Yes!  That was great.  I like fantasy, ad Sci Fiction, so I usually hit all of those as soon as they come out.
Speaking of Sci Fi, Alien Covenant is coming out too.
How is that one?
it is after Prometheus in the Alien series.
Sounds fantastic.
I probably won't be able to see that until next week.
I have to work to get to be able to do that one.
Yeah they can be expensive to go see a movie nowadays.
Let's try Tuesdays.
Why is that?
We can save money on Tuesdays, all shows $5 dollars.
Sounds great to me!
Awesome deal!
