Do you like Justin Bieber?
I would say no but his last few songs have been great.
He's been collaborating with some great people, for sure.
I was a big fan of the one he did with Major Lazer.
'Cold Water'? Yeah, that's a great song.
Have you heard 'I'm The One'?
With DJ Khaled? That's going to be a huge summer hit.
Sure is, it's so happy and summery.
I've already heard it blasting out of cars everywhere.
It's such a catchy pop song, though!
