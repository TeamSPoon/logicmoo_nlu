How did you like Beauty and the Beast?
It was OK. I prefer the original.
Yeah, that was pretty good.
Have you seen it yet?
No. I'm waiting for the DVD.
I thought Emma Watson was a pretty weird cast for Belle.
I thought the same thing.
She was alright, just weird.
I love Ian McKellen as the clock.
I didn't know he was in it.
I didn't either, until I watched it.
Pretty hard to miss that voice.
Indeed!
Anyone else of note.
Euen McGreggor was in it.
Who was he.
The candelabra.
Oh. Any good.
He puts on a pretty good French accent.
Well, maybe it won't be all that bad.
