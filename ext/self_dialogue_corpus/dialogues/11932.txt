Did you buy all the remastered albums that came out in 2009?
Yeah, it took me over a year to get them all.
Can I borrow "Meet the Beatles!", I've never listened to the whole thing.
Oops, sorry I didn't keep that one. I bought it, kept for a year and then I gave it away.
How come?
I only liked two or three songs from that album and since they were also in one of their greatest hits album, there was no reason for me to keep it.
Was that their first album?
I believe that was their first album released in the US, but in the UK I think they released "Please Please me" first.
Let's listen to "Please please me" then.
Okay.
