What vampire movie stands out the most to you?
Other than the original Dracula movie new and old, Underworld is one of my favorites
Why do you like them and what don't you like about them?
I like the sleek, clean look the vampires have.  Coven and clans are a good point about vampires, how they nest together.  But I did not like how they did not have more abilities like other vampire movies.  She could jump and shoot and strong. That was about it.  Then she drank alexanders blood and became more.
Did you like the story of selene and michael?
Yes, It was kind of a romeo and juliet plot.
Have you seen the new dracula untold movie?
Yes, I like how they make him out to be a victim and seeking revenge.  The amzing twist they put on dracula is incredible.
Compared to the Dracula 2000 and the old dracula which is better?
I like them both.  Dracula 2000 has a van helsing kind of character which is intriguing.  The original dracula is true to the story written by bram stroker.
Do you have a favorite werewolf movie?
I like the movie Blood and chocolate.
why?
The way the people turn into werewolves without the tearing flesh and the way running is in their blood.  Running and hunting and sex.  It is thrilling.
Have you seen the wolf man movie?
yes
What do you like about it?
I like the gypsies trying to help cure him or at least able to tell him what he has to due to fix the curse.
What is your favorite gypsy movie?
I like sherlock holmes part 2 where the gypsies are wild and fun, but family tight.
