You know, when I was a kid, I thought the Pink Panther movies were supposed to be cartoons?
Oh, because of the little shorts before the actual film?
Yeah, I had no idea the actual film revolved around the Pink Panther diamond and that's where the title came from!
Did you ever see the remake with Steve Martin?
Yes! It actually is not bad.
Do you like it more than the original?
I don't know about that. The original is dated, but it is a classic.
It's better than Son of the Pink Panther for sure.
Steve Martin's Pink Panther 2 is better than that, and it isn't even a good movie at all!
Hehe. I guess a lot of the Pink Panther films aren't so great.
That's what happens to any long running franchise. Just look at Nightmare on Elm Street for example.
Oh, or better yet Friday the 13th. Those movies had an even bigger decline than their Freddy based counterpart.
Saw had that problem too. Except with Saw 6. That one was actually surprisingly good.
At least all the Saw movies went to theaters. After the 4th Hellraiser movie, which was supposed to be the last, they just started releasing them straight to video.
Well, it's not just horror movies that suffer declines like this, but they're easy to point out because when they get big they put a new one out every year.
Speaking of which, they actually are bring Saw back!
Is it a reboot?
Maybe a little, but it's going to continue the story of the original films.
Then hopefully it can reverse the trend of movies in long franchises going downhill and be genuinely good.
That, and I hope we get another Pink Panther film someday!
