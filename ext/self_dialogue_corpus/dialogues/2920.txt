Are you a fan of the National Football League?
Yes, yes I am.
Did you watch the Draft?
Yes, I watched the Draft.
Who did your favorite team get?
They drafted Tre'Davious White.
What position does he play?
He played cornerback in college.
Did he play for LSU?
Yes, I believe so. My team got that pick in a trade.
Was it a good trade?
I believe so. They got it from Kansas City.
Is Alex still with the Chiefs?
Yes, Alex smith? I believe so.
He must be getting old now. I mean, he's been there for years.
Yes, he's old. He's at least in his thirties.
I wouldn't have guessed. Is the old Eagles' coach still there?
Yes. Why haven't they been to the playoffs yet?
I don't know. Maybe the coach forgot how to win.
That's a strong possibility. Or Smith is just too old.
