Have you heard of Toy Story 4 coming out?
Yes! I am super pumped.
I think my kids would love to see it.
Mine would too.
We should plan a movie date and watch it. Are they the same actors?
I would assume so. Tom Hanks being Woody as normal.
Tim Allen stars in the movie also. I wonder who produces them.
I am unsure who produces the others but I know this one, Galyn Susman produced it.
That name sounds familiar. Did John Lasseter still direct it or no?
Yes, along with Josh Cooley.
