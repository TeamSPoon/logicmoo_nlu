Who do you think is the greatest guitarist of all time?
I know a lot of people say Jimi Hendrix, but I'm gonna go with Jimmy Page.
Really?
Yeah.  There's no doubt in my mind at all that Jimi is great, but Led Zeppelin overall was a better band than the Experience.
So you think Page's guitar playing was better because the band he was in was better?
Well...yeah.  The songs were much better, and in the end, that's what it's all about.
What other guitar players do you like?
Slash, Dave Gilmour, Stevie Ray Vaughn.
All legendary.  I'm more a lead singer fan.
Who are your favorite lead singers?
Robert Plant, Mick Jagger, David Lee Roth.
You like Van Halen?
Yeah, I love Van Halen.  You don't?
I think they're ok, but I never got into their music.  It all sounded like commercial jingles.
Well, they did do that Clear Pepsi ad, so that's valid.
Since we both really like Led Zeppelin, did you know that Great White did an album of all Led Zeppelin covers?
Great White?
Yeah, they did Once Bitten Twice Shy.
Haha, was the album any good?
Yeah, it was really good, and I liked that they admired Zeppelin so much, that they put the album out.  Their cover of D'yer Mak'er is really good.
