Do you remember the first Karate Kid?
The one from the 80s?
Yeah, the one with Daniel LaRusso
Oh yeah I remember it well. Daniel Sun and Mr Miyagi.
Yeah, that was a classic movie.
Wax on, wax off.
Yeah, some of those training techniques were a little strange.
They taught humility and discipline. And they worked.
Well they did in the movie, I'm not sure they would work in reality.
Oh really. Do you think the Cobra Kai was a better teaching platform?
Yes, of course. They had some top level talent.
Yeah, but that instructor was insane.
Yeah, that's true. Someone like that wouldn't last in today's PC world.
And Mr Miyaga showed him up and the beginning of the 2nd movie.
Oh that's right. I always thought that was an odd scene.
Yeah, just tried to provide closure to that story line.
What happened to Daniel's girlfriend.
I think he said she ran off with a UCLA football player
Hmmm, so much for true love.
It was puppy dog love in the end.
