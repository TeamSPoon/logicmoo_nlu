The jazz music in the movie The Incredibles was great.
Yeah, the whole motif of the movie was that jazz music.
Did you like that character Frozone?
Oh absolutely. He was funny.
I think the movie did a great job of capturing everyday life of working people as well.
Yeah. Bob Parr was not liking his life till he got back in action.
It looked like their whole family was in need to get back in action.
You're totally right. I loved how that little lady Edna made the new suits.
She's so funny!
She reminds me of my grandmother! Haha.
