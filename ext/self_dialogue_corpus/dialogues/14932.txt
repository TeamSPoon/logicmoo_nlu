Best stupid movie... go!
Easy,  dumb and dumber. "So you're saying there's a chance!"
Haha yeah I love movies you can quote,  especially comedy.
Have you seen dirty work?
Is that the norm mcdonald one?
Yes,  where they start the revenge business.
Haha yeah it's great.  I also liked Tommy boy.  RIP Chris Farley.
No joke,  he was the best. Black sheep was hilarious.
He was good in that but I'm not a David spade fan.
