What are your thoughts about the Arizona Cardinals?
I think they have some great young players, perhaps not enough for a superbowl run
Carson Palmer is getting up there in age so I can see that.
Not only Palmer, but Larry Fitzgerald is on the fence of retirement also.
One guy I do like is David Johnson.
Yeah he is a good young RB.
He was a steal in the draft, he was what a 3rd or 4th round pick?
I am not sure but I think you are close if not correct.
He has been dominating the past few seasons.
Yeah he has a legit MVP shot this year if he can stay healthy
Health and the fact if the Cardinals can keep up the pass game to keep the pressure off.
Everyone knows Johnson is going to get his touches so keeping the safetys deep is crucial
Is there anyone else that sticks out to you on the Cardinals?
I really like LB Deone Bucannon.
You mean the Safety that converted to Linebacker
Yeah, it was a great move. His speed and coverage skills are awesome for a LB
Only downside is that he is undersized, he is still in the same weight as he was at Safety
That is true but he makes up for it in speed.
So David Johnson and Deone Bucannon. The future of the Cardinals perhaps?
Those two are a good group to build around that is for sure.
