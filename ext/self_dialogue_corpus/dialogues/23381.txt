Do you recommend a good actress to watch in a movie?
Of course, there are many, but personally I like Meryl Streep very much.
Really? Which movies has she been in?
Ricki and the Flash, Into the Woods, It´s Complicated, Julie & Julia, Doubt, Mamma Mia!, The Devil Wears Prada, The Hours, The House of Spirits, Sophie´s Choice
Wow, she does have a lot. What do you think about Julie & Julia?
I really liked it. It´s about the life of Julia Child and how a modern girl tried to do every recipe in Julia´s book for 1 year and blogged about it.
Wow that´s nice, was it inspired in a novel?
No, it´s inspired in real life events.
Who else was in the movie?
