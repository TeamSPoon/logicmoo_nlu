Do you remember the Rams from 1999? I did not watch football back then and someone mentioned that team recently.
I sure do remember them. They were great.
Who was the quarterback?
The quarterback was originally Trent Green, but it eventually fell to Kurt Warner before the season started.
How did Warner do? Was he a good quarterback?
Warner was excellent. In fact, he set all kinds of quarterbacking records that year?
Do you have an example of a record he set?
Sure I do. One example is the number of passing yards in the Super Bowl.
The Rams were in the Super Bowl that year?
They won the Super Bowl that year. Kurt Warner threw a bomb of about 75 yards for the winning touch down.
Who did he throw it to?
I believe it was Isaac Bruce, and Torry Holt ran down the field with him the whole way.
That sounds exciting. And that was the play that won the game?
It was the final points scored, but the Titans had one last drive to try to tie the game.
What happened?
The Titans marched straight down the field and almost scored. They were stopped on the 1-yard line as time expired.
Wow, that must have been something to see.
It really was. So much happened in that game and the Rams were such an exciting team.
Who else was on the Rams that season?
They had Marshall Faulk, who had 1000 yard receiving and rushing, and Mike Jones, who made the tackle at the 1-yard line.
