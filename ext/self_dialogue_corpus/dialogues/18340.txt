what do you think the top ten songs of all time are?
I am not sure but I would probably pick Bohemian Rhapsody.
I was thinking the same thing.
Ya its got to be one of the greatest so creative.
Ya and the musica and instrumentation is awesome.
Freddie Mercury is the reason the song was such a hit.
Ya I heard the rest of the band thought the song was silly but he fought for it.
Its so creative and I don't think another song will be liek it at all.
But Stairway to Heavan is also realy good too.
Ya the storytelling lyrics by Robert Plant are tough to beat.
I don't know though what about Imagine by John lennon.
Oh man that's a great one too.
The lyrics are so inspirational and so much of something i would the world will be like one day.
Ya its a love song but not about just one person but for the whole world.
You can't forget Smells Like Teen Spirit by Nirvana.
Kurt Coban is one of the greats for sure and that song is probably his best.
the lyrics are catchy and the instrumentation.
Ya it's one most people love to sing.
I know I do.
That's a great list it's hard to pick the best one from it.
