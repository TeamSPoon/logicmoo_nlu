You know what's a great comedy?  Bridesmaids.
Yes, it was terrific.  A wonderful cast.
I don't usually like that type of comedy.  But, this one just has the right cast to make it enjoyable.
Yes, Melissa McCarthy made her mark in this one!!
Yes, she is willing to take things to the edge.
Melissa is someone that you would watch in almost any movie.
I've seen Kristen in several movies.  She does have a certain sensitivity.
I also enjoy Kristen Wiig.  She is poignant as well as funny.
I also thought Maya Rudolph was very good.
I think she is underrated at times. She can play so many different characters and styles.
