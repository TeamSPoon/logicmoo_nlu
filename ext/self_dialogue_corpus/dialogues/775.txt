Hey, are you a Steelers fan?
Not really, I don't mind them but I wouldn't say I'm a fan.
I really like Ben Rothlisberger.
I like Big Ben, too. He's a heck of a quarterback at times.
I guess they resigned Le'Veon Bell to a long contract.
I was hoping he would go somewhere else. They're always hard to beat when he plays well.
I wonder how the Cincinnati Bengals are going to do this year.
Probably the same as every year. Play great during the season, beat teams they shouldn't be able to beat, lose to teams they should be able to beat and then lose in the playoffs.
That's funny. Different year, same story.
Andy Dalton just never gets any better. He looks great and then folds.
I can think of a lot of quarterbacks who are like that.
Yes, like Ryan Fitzpatrick. He looks as good as anyone and then look like a really bad rookie.
Yep, I totally agree with you. I wonder what the Jets are going to do for a quarterback?
I don't know. They have a couple young quarterbacks but I don't know how good they are.
I just looked it up. They have Josh McCown too.
At least he has some experience. That will help.
I'm surprised they didn't go for Colin Kaepernick or Jay Cutler.
Well, I can understand. There's too much baggage with Kaepernick and Jay Cutler is not a team player.
You're probably right. Cutler is going to call games, isn't he?
Yeah, I guess they couldn't resist his great personality.
