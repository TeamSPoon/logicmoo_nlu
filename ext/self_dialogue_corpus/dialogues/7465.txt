Can you guess which Disney film this song is from.
OK
Let's get down to business.
To defeat the Huns! Ha ha, that's obviously Mulan, I've watched it literally a hundred times.
Me too. Can't wait for the live-action remake.
Wait they're making a live-action remake.
Yep, it comes out next year I think.
I hope Ming-na Wen reprises her role as Mulan, she's such a total badass.
She's also as swift as a coursing river, with all the force of a great typhoon.
She's also got all of the strength of a raging fire and is as mysterious as the dark side of the moon.
