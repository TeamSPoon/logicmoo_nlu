What is your favorite band?
I really like The Strokes. They have brought Rock into the Modern Era.
I agree that The Strokes are a great band. What is your favorite song from them?
There are a lot of great ones. My favorite has to be "Is This It?" since it is the one that really got the band going.
That is a great song! I like that one almost as much as Ciggarette Daydreams by Cage The Elephant.
I also like that band and song! What is another song you like by Cage The Elephant?
"Cold, Cold, Cold" is an excellent song by them with a great chorus.
Yes that is a wonderful song. I also like Shake Me Down but that song is really sad.
It is a great song but one of the reasons I don't like it is because it is sad! I don't think artists should write sad music.
I have to disagree. It is important to address all emotions even the ones we are uncomfortable with.
You might be right. I can see how sad music can help people get through tough times.
Exactly now you see what I am talking about.
Other then the two bands we have mentioned, are there any other songs you like?
Ain't No Rest For The Wicked is another great song by Cage The Elephant.
I agree that is a good song.
Thanks for agreeing. Maybe we should throw a music party sometime and play songs from these two bands.
Your welcome and that is a great idea! I'm sure there are a few other great bands we could fit into the playlist.
Definitely and we should come up with at least 2 other bands.
Yes some possiblities are: Portugal The Man and Two Door Cinema Club.
Those two choices are perfect! Let's begin to plan this party with music from these 4 bands.
