Thanks for taking me to the game!
Yeah, no it is no problem.
Is it okay if I ask questions?
I'm guessing you haven't been to many games?
This is my first one.
That is exciting!
Why is there glass surrounding the playing field?
That is not glass.
What is it?
It is plastic.
Well, why is it there?
Sometimes the hockey puck may hit the plastic.
So it is to protect the crowd?
Yes, and to keep the puck in play.
That is cool.
Yeah, it can't be made of glass.
Because the glass would shatter?
Yeah, that would be bad.
That would be bad.  Thanks again for the ticket.
Any time I have an extra.
