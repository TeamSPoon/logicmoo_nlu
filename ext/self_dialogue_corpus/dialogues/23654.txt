I went to see Wonder Woman last night.
Oh yeah? How was it?
I loved it! It was everything I hoped it would be and more.
Awesome! I'm going to see it this weekend. Tell me how it was without spoilers.
Okay, so it stays true to the comics in many ways, but makes a few necessary tweaks to work well with the other DC movies.
That sounds fair. I don't like it when they change the source material too much.
Me either. Gal Gadot was amazing. Batman Vs. Superman left me wanting to see more of her.
I completely agree. She stole every scene she was in, in that movie.
Right. But at the same time, I was a little skeptical, because I only really know her from The Fast & The Furious.
I'm not a fan of those movies.
Me either. I heard Fast Five was good, but if it takes you five movies to make a good one, that's a problem.
So, how was Gal Gadot? I want details.
She was very charismatic. She did an amazing portrayal of Wonder Woman.
That's a relief. For some reason, it's been very hard for actresses to get the role of Wonder Woman down properly.
Except for Lynda Carter.
Of course. She will always be the original Wonder Woman.
Anyway, I will never doubt Gal Gadot's acting skills again. She makes a great action star as well.
Well, I'm glad you enjoyed the movie. I know how much of a DC fan you are.
I hope you enjoy it as well, when you see it this weekend.
I'll let you know what I think!
