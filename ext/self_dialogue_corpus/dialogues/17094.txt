Hey, is that Michael Jackson you're listening to?
Yes, it's Billie Jean!
That's a great song!  His music really makes me want to dance.
Me too.  I love this one, and I've always loved Don't Stop Til You Get Enough.
Yeah, that's a great song, too.  I can still remember when the video for Thriller came out.
I know, and his dancing is just unbelievable.
Yeah, it's really a shame.  He was a pop icon!
I know.  Tragic, really.
Did you listen to his sister Janet, too?
Oh yeah, I love Janet Jackson's music.  Escapade was a great single.
Yeah, she had a lot of great ones.
Rhythm Nation and That's the Way Love Goes were both great.
Yeah, they definitely had a very talented family.
I wonder if she and Michael ever did a duet?
I'm not really sure.  That definitely would've been interesting to hear.
Yeah, it would've.  Is she still making music?
I don't know, she's gotten a little old.  I guess it's possible.
I thought I heard she released something in 2015.
Yeah, I think I heard that too.  So I guess she's still going strong.
I don't know, I haven't heard it yet.
