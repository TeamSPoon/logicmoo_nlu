Do you like any rock bands like Foghat or Led Zepplin?
I love that song Slow Ride, and Stairway to Heaven.
Me too, I never got to see them in concert though.
Me neither, but listening to Foghat blasting on the stereo was cool.
We would go to the river and blast Led Zepplin too.
Did you like Bad Company?
Yes and their song Bad Company was the best.
I used to listen to Three Dog Night because my brother played it every morning.
Jerimiah was a Bullfrog was my favorite.
Yeah I should know that song by heart, we listened to it so much.
