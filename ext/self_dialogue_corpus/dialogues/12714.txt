Are you a big Star Wars fan?
Not really. I've only seen the first one.
I think I'm going to watch them before we go to Disney.
Oh that's a good idea. They're building new Star Wars stuff, right?
Yeah, but I don't know anything about it.
I will watch them with you!
Ok, let's start with the one with Princess Lea in the gold bikini.
It's a deal!
I'll bring copies over tonight.
I'll make some popcorn!
