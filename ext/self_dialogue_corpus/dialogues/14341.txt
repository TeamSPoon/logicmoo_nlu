Did you see the Warriors Spurs game yesterday?
I did and it appears the Spurs are done.
Yeah, without Kahwi Leonard out the Spurs really have no chance down 3 games to zero.
True, but they still have two big man. Both Pau Gasol and LeMarcus Aldridge are playing poorly.
I think even with Leonard the Spurs would not win the series, but probably two games.
Hrad to tell. The Spurs have a lot of history. They have five world titles.
The problem is the Warriors are loaded. Brilliant shooters and great play making.
True, but they have a dirty player in Draymond Green.
I'm not sure how dirty Green is, but anyone would like him on their team.
Why is that? Because he is the heart and soul of the team. Can do anything, rebound and pass and score.
Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant are superstars. They score are selfless and team players.
That is true. They are awfully talented and guys like JaVale McGee are having career years.
If and when the Dubs win this series how do you feel they will do against the Cavaliers?
It will be some series. Probably go seven games.
I agree with that. It is particularlly weird because both teams are likely to come into The Finals 12 and 0 which is record breaking.
Cleveland won last year. They showed more of a killer instinct with LeBron.
That is the problem. The Dubs are soft in my opinion. They are a finesse team not a lot of toughness.
What makes them soft? They have the best shooters in history
Because they are just that. Shooters. Only Green is tough, in the Finals the play gets rough and you have to be tough.
I agree, the Dubs may win this year but LeBron is a closer and may win it all.
