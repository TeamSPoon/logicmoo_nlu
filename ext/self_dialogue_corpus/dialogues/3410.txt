Hey Linda, you want to go with me to Friday Fright Night down at Jaspers?
What are they playing?  I hope not Scary Movie again.
No, looks like their showing The Exorcist.
Oh.  The new one or the Original.  I haven't seen the new one.
No, it's the old one with Linda Blair.
Uh...sure I'll go.  It's been a while since I've seen that.  Who's in the new one?
I believe that's The Exorcism of Molly Hartley that you're talking about.
Oh.  I thought it was a remake of the original.  Well I'd still like to see it.  It looks scary.
Well then you'll probably want to watch the Haunting of Molly Hartley first I think it comes first.
Ok.  Well lets go get our fill of green soup.
