What's your favorite Batman movie?
I would have to say the Dark Knight.
That would be my choice as well.
What did you think of Heath Ledgers performance?
I thought it was absolutely fabulous and right on the money.
Yeah he really did tap into the Joker really well. He was so good it was almost scary.
I would have loved to see him in a Joker origin movie.
That would have been epic, so sad he passed away.
I could never get tired of watching the Christopher Nolan trilogy.
We will always have the Dark Knight baby!
