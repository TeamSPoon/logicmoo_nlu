You know what's crazy?
What?
There are so many sub genres of music.
Like what?
Like Alt rock, Alt pop, Country pop, Pop rock, Rock n' roll. There's a one word variation and combination for every genre
Now that I think about it you're right.
Do you think it's necessary.
I guess people want to be specific with the kind of music they produce.
I wonder if it makes it more organized or less organized for the general audience.
Not sure about organization, but it definitely lends a sense of identity to music.
That's a good point. Music for a lot of people is about finding that unique niche, that you like and can connect with.
What subgenre would you connect with?
There's so many I couldn't say. Maybe Chill out? Positive Chill out. Something like that.
Yeah that sounds pretty nice, pretty chill. What about you
Death metal for sure.
You're kidding.
Nope. I'm getting a mohawk tomorrow.
That's ridiculous.
Yeah I'm only kidding.
Figured.
