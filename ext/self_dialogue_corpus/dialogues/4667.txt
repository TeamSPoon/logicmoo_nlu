Did you see the World Series last year?
I sure did. I'm an Indian's fan.
I was rooting for the Cubs.
I'm originally from Cleveland, so I have always like the Indians.
They seem to have a good chance to win it this year.
The AL Central isn't too strong, so they should be able to make it to the playoffs.
They definitely have a good bullpen.
Yeah, Andrew Miller and Cody Allen are both very good.
Who do you think will be in the World Series this year?
I predict it will be the Cubs and Indians again.
How do you think it will turn out?
I think the Indians will probably win this year with all their players being healthy again.
Who's your favorite player?
I would have to say Michael Brantley.
Are you planning on going to any games at Progressive Field this year?
I hope to go to at least a few.
Do you prefer to watch baseball live or on television?
I would rather watch live. Being apart of the crowd is a great experience.
Maybe my Cubs will just end up playing your Indians again.
If so, we should attend the game.
