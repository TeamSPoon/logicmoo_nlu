I want to play the baseball game on the radio.
That's fine. Go ahead.
Do you listen to the games?
Not usually but I will today.
Do you like baseball?
I don't really have an opinion. I played when I was a kid, though.
I didn't know that.
It was in elementary school.
Were you any good?
I was a deent batter.
Ever hit a home run?
Once. It felt awesome.
I bet it did.
Have you ever hit one?
Not ever. I don't play.
Did you ever?
Not really.
That's too bad. It seems like something you'd like.
I'm sure I would.
They have a local team. You should try out.
