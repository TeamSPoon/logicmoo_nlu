Do you have any music or songs you like that tell a story?
I don't know what you mean, exactly. Like, history?
Maybe. Sure.
There's lots of folk songs out there. They're pretty cool.
Got a favorite?
Um... how about the Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald by Gordon Lightfoot. That one always gives me chills.
Interesting! I've heard of Gordon Lightfoot but I don't know that song, I don't think.
It's incredible. It's about the crew of this ship in Lake Superior that died after a terrible storm.
That's intense. That kind of... well, it's about something totally different and probably more tragic...
What is it?
Cherokee Nation by Paul Revere and the Raiders.
Oh man. Is it about what I think it's about?
Native American rights and all the historical injustices that have been done to them.
I gotta listen to that.
It's a really haunting rock song... which is not a description I usually use for rock songs.
Yeah but no I get you. Was that band-?
Yeah I think the lead singer was part Cherokee.
Phew man, that's intense.
You could probably do a book report on every lyric of it.
I bet.
