Hey what kind of music do you listen to.
I like country music
So do I. I like Tim McGraw and Garth Brooks
I like them too. I also like southern rock.
Name a southern rock band you like.
The lynard skinner band
There pretty good but I also like allman brothers.
Do remember idlewild south.
Yeah that was a good album. When they used to be vinyl.
I think their best song was sweet home alabama.
That song was on their album called second helping.
I remember that album it came out in 1974.
They wrote that song towards neil young southern men. He is name checked in that song.
There was a lot of good music back then. Although I think that music today has its merits.
Yeah I know that music today is different than what we used to listen to.
You kow its kind of like when our parents had to hear what we were listening to and said that wasn't music.
I have listened to all different kinds of music over the years and I like all types of music.
So do I. It also shows that music has very few boundaries.
Well i have to go now, well see you later.
Yeah me too. Good talking to you.
