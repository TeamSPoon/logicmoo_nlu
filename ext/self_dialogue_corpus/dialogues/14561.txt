Did you see game 6 of Boston vs Washington?
Yea, it was exciting!
Yea, that  game winning shot by John Wall was intense.
You bet, I jumped out seat when he made it.
This has been the most exciting series so far during the playoffs.
I agree, most other series were sweeps or were not really close.
Who you routing for to win the next game?
I don't know. I kind of like Washington.
Yea, I think Washington is good too. They have some superstars.
Yea, I think so too. Boston is well balanced, but none of their players are elite.
Yes. Isaiah Thomas is good, but I don't think he can carry the whole team by himself.
They did get the number seed though for the season.
Ehh, I don't think it matters much. In the end I think Cleveland will go to the finals.
Hey, you never know. Washington and Boston did pretty well against the cavs during the regular season.
Yea, but regular season doesn't matter much. Playoffs is playoffs.
True. Lebron really stepped up his game during these playoffs.
Yes. I can picture him getting MVP. He is really dominating.
The addition of Kyle Korver during the season helped the cavs out a lot as well.
Yes, they've been crushing their opponents. The games weren't even close.
Yea. I guess I can see them going to the finals too.
