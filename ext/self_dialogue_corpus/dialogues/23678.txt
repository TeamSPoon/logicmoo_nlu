Have you seen a movie called Signs?
The one with Mel Gibson in it?
Yeah, and aliens and crop circles.
Yeah, I've seen it a few times.
I saw it for the first time last night myself.
How did you like it?
It was good. I wasn't expecting to like it after reading some reviews, but it was better than I heard.
Signs is one of M.Night Shyamalan's better movies.
There was one thing I didn't like about Signs, though.
What's that?
When the alien ships were hovering over different countries, why weren't any jets scrambled?
I know right? I wondered the something.
Someone could have fired a few missiles at them atleast. It was like the entire planet was docile and defenseless.
Makes better drama, I guess.
The part I liked the most was how everything was connected.
You mean the water and stuff? Yeah, that was a nice touch.
Those aliens were pretty dumb for trying to invade a planet that has more water than land.
They weren't counting on people discovering their weakness so easily.
What if it rained on them? What were those silly aliens going to do then?
Grab an umbrella I guess.
