I can't believe Kylo Ren killed Han Solo.
That was a devastating scene.
I wonder if Kylo will redeem himself before the trilogy ends.
I'd like to think so.  Redemption is always a powerful device in film.
Do you think he is too far gone?  Han's murder may have been the moral event horizon.
It very well may have been, but maybe Kylo will team up with Rey against Snokes.
That is always a possibility.  It seems as if they are building up Snokes to be the main villain.
And we still don't know what the deal with Luke is.
Do you think Luke may have nefarious plans or intentions?
I guess we will find out later this year when the next movie comes out!
