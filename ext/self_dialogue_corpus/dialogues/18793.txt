I miss Three Days Grace.
That's a bad I haven't heard in a while!
That's whats sad. I used to listen to them every day in high school.
They weren't on my top 10, but I did like them.
I can't think of a band I like more than them.
That's a first. I don't know anyone who has them as number one.
Never too late, Animal I have become, I hate everything about you. Classics.
I only know Animal I have Become.
Fun fact, I first heard that song in a WWE video game.
Is it your favorite?
No, Never too late probably is.
I never listened to it.
You have to, its great. Although, its depressing.
That's why I didn't listen to them much.
I get it, not for everyone.
Do they still make music?
No, their last album was in like 2013 I think.
Which album is your favorite?
I love One - X
I'll give it a shot
