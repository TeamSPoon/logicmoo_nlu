What's your opinion on scary movies?
They're some of my favourite kinds of movies, but I have to watch them in a certain setting.
What's that?
At night, but with a decent light on and with somebody else in the room even if it's my puppy.
Ahh, sounds like the perfect atmosphere.
It really is. I get scared easily and am prone to having nightmares ironically.
What are some of your favourites?
I love everything Wes Craven does. Anything based off of Stephen King's books, too, and most paranormal stuff.
So Like The Exorcist, American Haunting, Carrie, that kind of stuff?
Yeah exactly. Those are all great examples.
I like how creative horror/thriller movies are getting lately.
Me too, I thought The Babadook was really interesting in the sounds used and the surprise ending... I'm still not sure how to feel about it.
Oh, you mean how she ends up keeping The Babadook as some sort of pet almost?
Yeah, I've never seen anything like that in a scary movie. It kind of helped me be spooked less by making me almost feel sorry for him.
I felt that way too. Isn't it unfair how they can manipulate our feelings towards a character like that?
Yeah, like the whole time you're hiding behind your blanket from him and then at the end you feel kind of endeared towards him.
I know, makes me want a babadook as my own pet!
But everything about that movie I thought was spot on, from the photography to the acting to the book itself. I mean you have to be relly artistic to come up with that.
The book was probably my favourite part. The way it was constructed and the whole concept of it really made the movie for me.
Yeah, I would definitely recommend it to anybody who's even slightly willing to give scary movies a chance.
