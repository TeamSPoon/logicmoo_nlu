Hey whats you opinion on Journey?
The rock band?
Yeah.
I think they are awesome and I respect their early work. However I am not  a current fan.
Why not?
I honestly feel the band just wasn't the same without their lead singer Stephen Perry.
What makes you say something like that?
Dude, He has an iconic voice and he was the face of the band when he was lead singer.
I mean I agree somewhat but I think they are still good without him.
I can't agree with you there. I think the band lost an icon in Perry.
