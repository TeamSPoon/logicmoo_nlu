How come you did not like "Frozen"?
I think it was underrated.
I actually liked it. I did like the music.
The only reason "Frozen" was popular was there were no other family movies showing at that time.
Is that true? I will have to look that up. Do you think that's how "Frozen" got so popular?
Yes. And I am telling you, it's overrated.
Okay. Is that - is that a "Frozen" backpack you are carrying?
Yeah, it is. I like Olaf.
You are putting down "Frozen" but you are buying the merchandise?
Well, I like Olaf.
