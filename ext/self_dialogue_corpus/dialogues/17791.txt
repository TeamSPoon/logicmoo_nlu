What do you listen to when you work out?
That depends! I always listen to something when I run, but it changes with how far I'm running.
What do you mean?
For my long runs I tend to listen to podcasts, but I listen to some interesting music for my track workouts.
Interesting, eh? What do you mean by that?
Definitely music people don't expect me to listen to - a lot of EDM, hip hop, rap, sometimes metal and punk too.
Wow, yeah, I can picture you listening to metal and punk, but not EDM, hip hop or rap. Do you have any favorite artists?
Honestly, I've been listening to a lot of Tyga when I run.
That's so interesting! I like his song Switch Lanes.
I listen to that all the time when I run! I've also been listening to some EDM like Darude.
Oh man, like Sandstorm? That's such a great dance song.
I agree! I could dance all night to it, and it's long too, so it gets me through some tough track sessions.
Yeah I'll bet! Do you know the song Tsunami?
Yeah, it's by DVBBS and Borgeous right?
That's the one! I bet that gets you pumped for a workout too.
Definitely! Sometimes I'll stick that song in between podcasts when I'm on a long run to sort of wake myself up and get a jolt of speed.
That sounds awesome. I bet you would like Steve Aoki if you don't listen to him already.
You know, I saw a documentary on him recently, but I haven't actually listened to his music! What would you recommend?
You should definitely check out his 2014-2015 albums Neon Future I and II. You'll probably really like them for workouts.
Awesome! I'll definitely check them out.
