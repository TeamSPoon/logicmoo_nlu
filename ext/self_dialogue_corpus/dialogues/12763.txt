Have you seen Star Wars?
Yes I have.
Who is your favorite character?
That has to be Darth Vader.
Why the villain?
I've always had a thing for villains and Vader  is one of those bad guys that's not such a bad guy deep down.
Why do you say he's not such a bad guy?
Well at the end he comes out of his big mean shell you could say.
Well that's true.
That  is why I like Vader.
