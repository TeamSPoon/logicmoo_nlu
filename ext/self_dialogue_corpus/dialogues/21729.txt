Did you ever see ET?
Yes, way back in the day.
Did you like it?
Yes, overall I was a fan. I probably should watch it again.
I watched it recently. It holds up well even today.
What was the main kid's name again?
Elliott. He does well as a child actor.
I remember the big scene with the red hoodie and bikes flying in the air.
Yes, iconic movie scene. Especially when they go past the moon.
Some good 80s style in that movie as well.
Yes, Spielberg did a good job. Kind of like a time period piece.
Wasn't Drew Barrymore in that movie as well?
Yes, she played the younger sister.
Wow, she must've been young back then.
Yes, one of her first roles.
I remember a scary scene where they find the alien in the corn field at night.
Right I think that was towards the beginning.
I remember being scared with that scene as a kid.
Yeah, definitely a jump out of your seat moment.
Overall a good movie though.
