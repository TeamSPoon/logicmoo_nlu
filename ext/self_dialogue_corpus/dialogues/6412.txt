Have you heard that the Incredibles 2 is coming out next year?
I did not, I wonder what they are planning to do.  Do you think they will have the characters age?
I'm not sure, many of the Disney movies do have characters that seem to progress in life, but the Incredibles already was at a good age for all the characters.
I wonder how older Jak will look and act!
Me too.  I really liked his animated short "Jak Attack" with the babysitter.
That was definitely one of my favorites too.
Maybe they will age him, but get a famous actor to do the voiceover.
That would be a good opportunity to do that.
I personally really like the villains in movies like this.
I agree, the movie really only does well if you have a good antagonist!
