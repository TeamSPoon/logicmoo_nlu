Have you seen the movie Requiem for a Dream?
Oh gosh, with Jared Leto and Jennifer Jason Leigh?
No, it's Jared Leto and Jennifer Connolly.
Oh yeah, my bad.  Yes, I have seen it.
It's a Daron Aronofsky movie.
Yeah, it came out back around 2000 didn't it? I remember seeing it in high school.
Yes.  What a chilling movie.
I know, it really sticks with you.
I think it was based after a book, wasn't it? I read that somewhere.
Yeah, I'm pretty sure I heard that too.  It's really depressing to watch.
I know.  I found it hard to watch to be honest.
Yeah, it's almost like a public service announcement.
Well it sure does scare the viewer.  I think it's a positive thing to watch, though.
Maybe so.  It's definitely disturbing.
Yeah.  I think it's a pretty accurate depiction of addiction, though.
Yeah, probably one of the most accurate I've seen.
And at least it doesn't glorify it like some movies do.
That's true!  I can't stand seeing that happen.
Yeah, it should almost be shown as a drug prevention movie.
Yeah, it would work as that aside from the inappropriate scenes.
