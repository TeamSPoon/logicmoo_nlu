Have you seen Guardians of the Galaxy?
That's the one with Chris Pratt, right?
Yes, I saw it in theaters a while back.
I haven't seen it yet, but we bought it on DVD when it came out.
You have it on DVD and haven't watched it yet?
Well, I figured it was more of a boys movie.
Not necessarily true. Sure, it's an action movie, but I think it's great for the whole family!
I'm just not a space movie fan.
It's really more of a comedy set in space.
How so?
Chris Pratt does a fantastic job at portraying his character, but he's such a funny guy and it shows.
This is also the same movie with the "Groot" character, right?
Yes! He's one of the general favorites!
I have seen pictures and videos of him and he is funny.
There's a little Groot too, and it's really cute!
A little Groot?
Like a miniature version of the one you've seen.
Oh, I see.
I would definitely recommend watching it, especially if you already have it!
I'll do that!
