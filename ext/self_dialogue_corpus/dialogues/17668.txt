What is your favorite musical?
Recently or from whenever?
From any time, any decade.
I would say The Sound of Music
Why do you say that?
it has such a great plot and it is funny too
What's the best song?
My family really likes "I am 16 going on 17"
is that what the oldest daughter sings to her boyfriend?
Yeah, but he's just a friend at the time.
Do they ever end up dating?
I don't think so, he joins the Nazi's and becomes bad
That's sad. Do you like all the characters from the movie?
Yeah they are all done very well and are good at their roles
I want to see the movie now! It sounds so good!
You should watch it with your family, it's a great family movie!
You said there were Nazi's, is it scary?
Oh, don't worry about it. It's not scary!
Oh okay, thanks for letting me know!
Soon all the songs will be stuck in your head!
