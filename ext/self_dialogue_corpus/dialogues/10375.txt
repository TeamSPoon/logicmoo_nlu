I liked her in RED and RED 2.
I did too.
I think RED 2 was better.
So do I, but that's because of Anthony Hopkins.
Yes, I loved him as the bumbling professor.
I didn't see that twist coming.
Neither did I.
I also liked John Malkovich.
Ha, yeah. He was great in those movies.
Have you seen Being John Malkovich.
Yes. Talk about a weird movie.
Very much so. What else has he been in?
Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.
Really, what was he in that?
He was the other person running for president.
The one who was the head of the weird sneeze religion?
Yes, exactly.
That was such as weird movie.
Yes, but it's also one of my very favorites.
So long and thanks for all the fish...
