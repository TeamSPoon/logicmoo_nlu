How many actresses are in LA you think?
A lot. just look at all the waitresses around Hollywood
I mean in terms of numbers, thousands? Tens of thousands?
This type of questions belong in The census bureau. Why don't you ask them?
So you don't know
of course I don't know. I have no idea. But! But! I do know how to estimate it.
Alright smart guy, how do you estimate the number of movie actresses in LA?
There are about 135K people in SAG-AFTRA or screen actor's guild-American Federation of Television and Radio artists.
That's liek total number of people who has a union membership in those.
Yes, but I'm not done. Of those, we can estimate about 80% of the work is done in LA
which gives you, what? About a hundred thousand?
Yes, but not all of them are currently acting "actors" We can see another 80% are out of work "actors"
So that gives you about 20k people.
Yep. And say about half are women, so we probably have about 10 thousand actresses vying for jobs in LA /Hollywood area
And you think why making it is so hard.
Imagine 10K competition for a one position. Of course it won't be as bad as that
Might as well be though. A pool of 10 thousand people is still a big pool.
Even if just 100 people apply for one position, you have 1% chance.
And 100 is just 1% of 10K. So you literally have to be 1% of 1% to make it.
That's some tough work. Makes you want to respect actresses.
