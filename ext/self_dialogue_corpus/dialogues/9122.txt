How much do you like the Grateful Dead?
I'm not a big fan.
No,I'm not either.
They had a lot of big rock albums though.
Yes they did.
I did like one song. A touch of grey.
That was a pretty good tune.
Other than that,not a big fan.
They had a rediculous following.
For sure. Didn't get the whole thing though.
