I just finished Prisoner of Azkaban, have you read it?
Yeah, it's one of my favorites.
Okay, so what did you think of Sirius?
I like him quite a bit, but he's a bit odd. What do you mean?
Well, the Harry/Sirius dynamic is a bit, strange.
Well, I think it would be that way with any nephew and uncle who have never really met (except when Harry was a baby).
True, I guess I just thought it seemed sudden.
It really was, but still it's essential to the story.
I just really hate Snape and how smug and haughty he was the entire time.
Yeah, Sirius definitely didn't deserve that.
