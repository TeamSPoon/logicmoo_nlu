Have you seen the new Wonder Woman film yet?
Yes, I have, have you?
Not yet, I was wondering if it was worth all the hype.
I liked it.  Although they did change the Greek Mythology to suit themselves.
They did?  What did they do?
Oh, they said that Diana was the daughter of Zeus and that all the gods were dead because of a battle.
That does sound a little odd.
Except for Mars, the god of War.  He was still around giving trouble.
Well, it does seem that war never ends, so it would be a good story line.
Yes, it actually worked out pretty well.  My husband and I talked about the changes and decided that storytelling was storytelling.
So the story was good.
Pretty good, but the best part was WW.
Why?
It was so good seeing a woman hero that did not have to be saved by a man.
Oh, tell me more.
Are you sure?  I don't want to give away the ending.
No, it's ok, I will see it anyway.
One of the funniest parts was when Diana tells male protagonist that men are really only necessary for procreation and nothing else.
Oh that does sound cute.
Oh yeah, the look on his face was priceless!
