There are so many bands out there that are just trying to be The Beatles.
Well, that makes sense. They're probably the most successful band of all time.
That's true. And I guess that means there are going to be a lot of high-profile copycats.
Like who?
Well, I think Oasis was convinced they were going to be the next Beatles for most of the nineties.
I always forget about them.
I really don't think they're very good.
Well, okay. I can agree with that. Who else?
The Pillows?
I've never heard of them.
They're a Japanese band, but they sound a lot like the Beatles.
Really? That's very surprising.
Some of their music videos are even modeled after them.
Well, that's a little bit silly.
See? There are lots of bands like this.
Okay, I can see that. But is it really a bad thing?
I think if we just recycle influences, music as a whole never really evolves.
So you think it's slowing music down.
Maybe. I don't know. I could be crazy.
Not at all! What you're saying makes sense.
