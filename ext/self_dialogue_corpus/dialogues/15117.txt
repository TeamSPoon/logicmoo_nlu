Thinking about all the great comedy movies.
I absolutely love Airplane.
That was a real classic.  "Don't call me Shirley!"
Yes the whole movie had great set ups and punch lines.
I love Robert Hays.  So funny playing the straight man.
Yes and Julie Hagerty also was terrific in that movie.
I never stop laughing when I watch it.
I love the part when everyone takes a turn slapping the passenger.
Yes, and Lloyd Bridges as the airplane controller.
He was hilarious in that role.
