What is a good movie that comes out this weekend?
Well, Despicable Me 3 comes out.
Really, I love animated movies!
I didn't like Despicable Me 2.
It wasn't great, but I liked Despicable Me 1.
That's true, it was a decent movie.
I really like the voice of Steve Carrel.
He is a good actor.
Do you know what other actors are in this movie?
Yes, Kristin Wig is in it.
Really? I loved her in Bridesmaids!
Did you know she wrote that movie?
No, I didn't!
Yes, she is really talented.
Are she and Steve Carrel married?
No they aren't!  Why would you say that?
They seem to have a lot of chemistry on screen.
I think that is because they were on Saturday Night Live together.
Well, I am excited for this movie now!
You know what, you're right!  I'll go see it with you this weekend.
