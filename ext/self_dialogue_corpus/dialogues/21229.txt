Have you seen any good movies lately?
Yes, I saw "Snatched" last night.
What did you think about it?
It was a pretty good movie. It was entertaining and fairly funny.
It looked pretty good in the trailer. Though I'm not too sure if I'll see it.
I think you should. You would like it.
I'm looking forward to the new "Alien" movie coming out next week!
I haven't heard about that one. Do you like that series?
Yeah, I've been a big fan of the whole "Alien" series so I really do want to see it.
Maybe I'll check it out as well. I sometimes enjoy horror movies.
Sounds good. Do you want to go together?
Sure! Do you know where it's playing?
It will be at the theater near my house.
Cool, I could meet you there. Want to get a meal before the movie?
That sounds good. We could eat at Johnny Rockets.
How about Ruby Tuesday's? I have a coupoun for them.
That sounds great! You know I love coupons.
So it's settled then.
Yep, I'll see you Friday night.
Great! See you then!
