What does your ultimate play list look like?
For music?
Yes, any kind.
It would be a mix of genres.
Like a Darius Rucker play list?
Right, country and rock, just like him and then some.
I think it is so impressive he went from a well known band to a well known solo artist in a whole other genre.
What was his band called?
Hootie and The Blowfish.
What did they sing?
They had a lot of hit in the ninties.
Like what?
Let Her Cry, Only want to Be With You, a lot.
Wow, and now he does country.
Yes, he did a song called Rock Me.
I know it did really well.
I think he is one of the best new country singers in the last decade.
Even though he is not really new.
No, but Let Me Be Your man always made me want to hear him do country.
Now he has a whole bunch of songs for you.
