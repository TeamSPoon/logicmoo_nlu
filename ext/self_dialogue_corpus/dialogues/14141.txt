Why do you think that ARTPOP is underappreciated?
I think there was a problem with management during that time and it wasn't promoted well.
What is your favorite Gaga song?
I can't choose one! I'd go with Venus or Diamond Heart.
Those are awesome songs! Are you going to her tour this summer?
Yeah! I'm going to two concerts.
What songs do you hope Gaga will perform?
I'd love to hear Just Dance again even though it's been overplayed over the years.
I know, can you believe she's been around since 2008?
No, it seems like just yesterday the Just Dance was on the radio!
