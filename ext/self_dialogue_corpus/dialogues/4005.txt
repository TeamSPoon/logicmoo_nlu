You ever see The Shining?
Yes that was some movie.
Yes Jack Nicholson goes nuts.
For sure he plays a good psycho.
What about Thinner you see that one?
Yes that was great.
Yes that guy got so thin and ate everything in that movie.
Then gave the curse to his wife and daughter.
I like Kari Wuhrer.
Yeah me too. She was on my soap opera for a little while.
