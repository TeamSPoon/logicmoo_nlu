Have you seen any good movies lately?
Passengers wasn't bad.
Who is in that? I haven't heard of it.
Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence.
Oh maybe I've seen the trailer. Is that the one where they're trapped in a ship or something?
Yeah it's like a giant moving truck spaceship.
Moving truck spaceship?
Well yeah because it's essentially moving thousands of people from planet to another.
Oh I see. So what happens.
Well without giving too much away they wake up early and fall in love.
Oh I hate love stories.
Normally I do too but this one is actually good.
What's different about it?
Without giving too much away again, there's more going on than just a love story.
I think I remember reading about that movie now. It didn't get great reviews.
No but to each their own. That's what I say. The design and special effects are really cool too.
I don't know if even care about that.
Normally I don;t either but they made it all look really nice.
Well I have been looking for something to watch. Might give it a shot.
You wont be disappointed.
