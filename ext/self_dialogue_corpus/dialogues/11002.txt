Do you think the Rangers will start to dismantle their team?
No, why would they do that?
Cause they keep failing expectations.
I mean their window is closing as Hank gets older.
Exactly so why not start to rebuild now?
They dont need a rebuild, maybe a retool.
Would signing Shattenkirk help them?
I dont see how it could.
How about signing a goalie?
That would be right if Hank was on his way out.
Yeah hes still playing at a high level
Eventually he wont be and they need to fix the problem.
I wonder if theyll draft a guy or go through trades.
Well they should draft now. Normally it takes time.
What about Nash?
Hes played up to his contract.
He could reap in a big return.
I agree with most of that, he does have a higher cap hit.
Yeah but hes good still and can play where you need him.
I agree, he isnt an absolute albatross.
