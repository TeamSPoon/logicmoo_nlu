What's your favorite Batman movie?
That's a tough one.  I love them all in different ways.
Mine is The Dark Knight.
Is that the one with Heath Ledger as Joker?
Yeah, that's the one.
I would say that's my favorite, too.
Did you know Heath Ledger produced all the Joker home videos in the movie?
No, that's pretty cool.
The director liked them so much he just let Heath do whatever he wanted.
Heath Ledger was a great Joker.
It's to bad he died right after the movie.
I would of loved to seen him play the Joker one more time.
Did you also know the destroyed one of the 4 IMAX cameras while shooting the movie?
There were only 4 IMAX cameras in the world at the time?
Yeah, and they destroyed one of them.
How did they destroy it?
During the scene where the semi truck flips over.  One of the cameras got hit.
How much do those camera's cost?
Only about $250,000.
That is one expensive camera.
