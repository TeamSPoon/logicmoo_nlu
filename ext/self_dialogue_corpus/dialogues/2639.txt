Do you like the Panthers?
No not really. They aren't a popular team
I know what you mean, they are probably one of the worst teams of the league
Their stats for last year were sort of bad.
Did they lose about eight games last year?
Uh huh I think they only won about five
Why do you think that is - I mean is it the coaching or what?
Obviously the coaching and bad draft picks. The skills of the players have alot to do with it
Who are their draft picks this year
They signed about eight new players. But best draft choices would have to be Moton and McCaffrey
We have yet to see what they will do for the team
They may need to draft a new coach too
You don't think Cam Newton gets the job done?
He could do better !
Yeah, Really I mean eight losses.
What strategies do you think he needs to employ?
His players need to be much  stronger on the offensive
Truly and reviewing tapings from last years games might help a little more
It just may.
The fault doesn't only lie with the coach though.
