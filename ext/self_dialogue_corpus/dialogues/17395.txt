Have you ever seen Elton John in concert?
No, I haven't.  What about you?
Yes, twice.  Once when I was in college at the Chicago Stadium and once at Lincoln Center.
Wow, Which one was better.
Well the Chicago Stadium was an experience because of the large crowd and all the theatrics.
Yeah I have heard he puts on a great show and has some great outfits.
That's true, but I enjoyed the Lincoln Center performance more.
Why is that?
At Lincoln Center it was all about his music.
What do you mean by that.
It was just Elton John and his piano.
Wow, that does sound great.
He talked in between each song and gave us a little history of each song.
Did he do any new stuff?
No, it was all his old classics, but that is what you really want to hear anyways.
What did he open with?
He started with the song from the Lion King.
Awesome, I didn't know he did that one.
Yes, it is one he who composed The Circle of Life and Tim Rice did the Lyrics
I knew there was a reason that I liked that song.  Elton John is an amazing composer as well as singer.
