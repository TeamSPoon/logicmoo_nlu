Did you ever see Something About Mary?
Oh yeah, that is a classic comedy movie.
Yeah I think it was a Farrelly Brothers production
Yes that is correct
Cameron Diaz was pretty good looking back then
Yeah, she was definitely the object of affection for many men
Didn't Brett Favre make an appearance in that one?
He sure did. He played her current boyfriend if I recall.
Yeah, that's right. And then there was the whole zipper scene in the beginning.
Oh yeah, who could forget that one.
I always thought the fish hook scene was painful to watch as well.
Yeah, that would hurt.
What other movies did those brothers make?
They did Dumb and Dumber
Oh man, that was one of my favorite movies when I was in high school
Yeah, Jim Carrey at his finest
Yeah, he was really good in that one.
They were dead set on getting to Aspen
Right, to find the girl of their dreams.
Oh man, the scene on the motorcycle was classic.
