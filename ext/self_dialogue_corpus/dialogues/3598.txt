Have you seen any horror movies lately?
I actually saw a good one a few weeks ago, I don't remember the name though.
What was it about?
It was about a doll that came to life and killed everyone.
Oh, I think I saw that in the theatres!
No, I don't remember it being in the theatres, this one was indie.
Oh, so it wasn't Annabelle?
No, but it was heavily influenced by the genre.
I wish you remembered the name.
When I do, I'll let you know!
