I just heard the best redo of Lady Gaga's Romance!
A redo of her song?
You know a parody, but it is about the history of the French Revolution! It's on YouTube.
How did they incorporate the French revolution?
They talked about the motto "Liberté égalité fraternité"
I just watched it and it's very catchy!
It includes all the main characters, Marie Antoinette, Robespierre, Napoleon.
Lady Gaga's music and Lyrics pattern was used to great effect for this song.
I won't be able to hear Lady Gaga sing this now with out thinking about the French Revolution.
La la liberte! Eh Eh Egalite, fra fra Fraternite!  A Revolution!
