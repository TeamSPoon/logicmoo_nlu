What do you think about the collapse in quality of music today?
I think hip hop music has taken a big toll.
Are you a regular listener of hip hop music?
I don't really have a preference, but I am into old school hip hop.
Me too. It seems there was more to say in hip hop back in the day.
Who is your favorite hip hop artisit?
I would have to say MF Doom.
I don't think I have ever heard of that person. What do they sing?
MF Doom is an underground artist. He has a song call "In The Streets".
I'm going to look it up and give it a listen. I enjoy discovering new artist.
It's a great song and he is a talented intelligent artist.
Yes it is.  I enjoyed that song very much.
You're welcome. I love to share great hip hop with other people.
With the way hip hop has declined I'm greatful to be able to find quality music.
There are a lot of other artist that are similar to MF Doom.
Where would I be able to find those others?
If you search MF Doom on YouTube there should be other artist like him in the list of results.
I'm going to search and find others who share his style, I enjoyed it very much.
I'm glad I could help.
Thank you very much for opening my eyes to this type of hip hop.
