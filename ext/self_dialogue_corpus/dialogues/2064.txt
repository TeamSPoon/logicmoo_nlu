What can we expect from the 2017 NFL season?
Expect more stability and less drama. Politics should play less a part, and the focus will be more on football.
What about rules changes?
The NFL seems to be clueless about what the rules are supposed to accomplish, and after some encouraging recent ideas the league keeps trying to fix what isn't broken.
Is overtime an area of interest?
Overtime should be eliminated in the regular season. It is a device designed to break a tie, and there is no need to break a tie in the regular season.
Are the new stadiums a benefit to the NFL?
Maybe. This is the third clearly-definable stadium boom in league history, but the new buildings detract from the game instead of enhancing it.
What are some mid-level contenders that might become wild-card playoff teams?
The Buffalo Bills are one. Stability and focus on football should help the upstate New York team make progress. Tyrod Taylor is underrated.
What other mid-level teams show promise?
The Bengals keep coming back for more, and the Saints might string some wins together if Drew Brees stays fit and able.
Any others? Like Minnesota?
The Vikings are a gritty outfit that needs a few breaks, but their mindset is good thanks to Mike Zimmer.
What goliaths are shadows of their former selves?
The Packers are an odd duck, a passing game with hardly anything else. They hardly evoke the Mike Holmgren & Brett Favre successes, let alone the glory years of Lombardi and Starr.
Maybe the Giants fit in this category also?
Definitely. After Manning, who is there on the roster who is truly reliable? The talent is there in spots, but can it be counted on?
How about the Steelers?
A good team with a good coach and good quarterback, but — much like the Packers — there isn't much else to get excited about, aside from James Harrison.
