Do you like Janet Jackson?
I love her music.
What's your favorite song?
I like everything on the Janet album.
Is that the one with If on it?
Yes. I love If.
I like that album too. I like That's The Way Love Goes.
Me too. I think that was her best album from start to finish.
She's made albums after that but I can't think of any names.
I like her earlier stuff also. I still listen to The Pleasure Principal.
I love Control.
That's when she was down with Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis.
Them two were making bangers for everybody back then.
I know right.
Weren't those two members of Morris Day's group?
You mean The Time?
Yeah, that's it.
Yes they were.
I think Prince is credited for discovering Morris Day and them.
I think so too.
