Do you know of Pink Floyd?
Yes I have heard some of them.
Have you listen to their complete albums?
No I have not.
You really need to.
Why is that?
They are truly a special and unique band.
What makes them unique?
They have the most unusual sound.
Is that a good thing?
Yes because they make it sound good and most importantly impart a special feeling in the listener.
What kind of feelling.
One of transcendence, relaxation, and it is like a mental dream experience.
Wow that sounds special.
Yes it really sets the mood.
Wow they must be wholly unique.
They really are, it is why Pink Floyd is still popular today.
Yes that is some longevity.
Yes they are great.
I am looking forward to listening to their classic album.
