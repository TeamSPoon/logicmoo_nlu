Hi.
Hello.
Are you interested in Star Wars?
Yeah I like it okay.
Do you have any kids?  Do they like it.
Yes I have a boy that's 7.  He's just now getting into them.
That's great.  That's about the age I started getting into them.
Boys sure do seem to love these movies.
I know quite a few girls that like them as well.
Really?  Interesting.
