Which of the Mission Impossible movies did you like the most?
Probably Ghost Protocol.
Isn't that the one where they were dodging sandstorms in the middle east?
Yup, and he was clinging to the building.
That had a really funny line in it, and Simon Pegg is hilarious.
Yours?
Mission Impossible 3.
Really?? Why that one?
That was one of the best-rated, acted, and written. It just didn't get publicity because it's when Tom Cruise came out as crazy.
Oh, right after the couch-jumping scene and Scientology. I'll watch it.
