Meet the Robinsons is a very good but underrated film.
I completely agree. I love the message that u cannot focus on yesterday but look to tomorrow.
Exactly, it's something that people should do more
I love how the characters are so wacky and crazy.
And they are so fun you just want to keep watching more!
Did you know that it is based off a book?
No, I had no idea. What is the book called
A Day with Wilbur Robinson by William Joyce. You should read it, I bet you'll like it a lot.
I think I will check it out. I'm interested to see how the two compare.
You can get it for your Kindle on Amazon if you want.
