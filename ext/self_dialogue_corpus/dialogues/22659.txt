Did you watch the original X-Men movie?
I did.
Did you like it?
Yes I did, but I was a big fan I used to watch the cartoon growing up.
Do you think they did a good job?
They did a great job showing what it was supposed to be and then creating an exciting end to it.
Yeah I agree, I've never been a big X-Men fan but I liked seeing the school and how everything came to be.
I agree, I loved seeing Xavier's School in a realistic movie.
Who is your favorite X-Men?
That's easy Wolverine.
Why him?
He's very tough and rough but he has to be.
Yeah but some people don't like that.
Though he always does the right thing when it matters.
Yes he does.
Plus he has regenerative powers and claws.
The claws and the facial hair sell it for me.
Me too makes him appear like this animal but in a good way.
That's so true.
I just love the character.
