What do you think is hitchcocks scariest film?
Psycho, I think this is his scariest ever, don't you?
It is good. but scariest for me is The bird's.
I think the they are both worthy of being in the horror category. Psycho is far more scary though.
I don't agree. THE FACT THAT NATURE IS SO UNCONTROLLABLE AND CAN JUST TURN ON HUMANS ANYTIME IS THE ULTIMATE SACRE.
no need to yell.. Just kidding. It is a scary concept. But still say psycho look at what that says about human nature and how sick some people are.
I think we will have to agree to disagree on hitchcocks scariest. Anthony Perkins certainly creeped me out in this role.
Perkins is the ultimate creep in this role. Did you ever notice how he walks up the stairs in the main house?
Yes actually, he kind of sashes, sways his hips like a woman.
I often wonder if this was perkins natural movement or a character choice.. either way worked well for the role.
