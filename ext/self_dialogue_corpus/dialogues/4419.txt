What did you think of that new shark thriller film, 47 Meters Down?
I thought it was pretty awful. I almost couldn't sit through it. The only thing I liked was the ending.
Seriously? I thought it was great. What didn't you like about it?
The two girls squealing like bubbleheads the whole time drove me nuts. You'd think with that much air in their heads, they wouldn't have run out of oxygen.
You just made me laugh, you're funny. What did you like about the ending?
It was pretty much the only part of the film that was really emotional. Otherwise it was the kind of film where you end up rooting for the sharks.
You have to admit, it was tense and suspenseful.
Yes, that it was for sure! But if you want a better shark film, I'd recommend The Shallows.
With Blake Lively? I've been meaning to see that.
It's great, it's just her and the shark for most of the film, but she is intelligent, resourceful, and definitely not annoying!
