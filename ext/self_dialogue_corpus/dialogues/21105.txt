I really like musicals.
Not me other than a few.
Which ones?
I like Carousel.
That one is kind of depressing.
I like the music, though.
Yes, it does have good music. So does Grease.
Ug, that movie is lame.
Even the music?
Well, the songs are OK.
Yes, they're fine I guess. Some are fun.
I've always liked Olivia Newton John.
Me too. I like her country songs.
Country?
Yes, look them up. 'Let Me Be There' is an example.
I will see.
She's not too believable in Grease.
The whole thing is kind of funny and kitchy.
Yes, true.
That's what most like about it.
