Liam neeson is so fricken cool.
What, the old irish guy?
Old? Please, he is in his prime.
He is at least 60.
But taken was so good! Who cares about his age.
I dont know, its not believable for me.
What, you dont think he cant really be as badass as the movies make him look?
Yeah, its a great film but its all fake.
Whatever. He is still my man crush.
What a twist! This conversation has really 'taken' a wrong turn I think.
