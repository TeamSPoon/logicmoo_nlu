Do you like classical music?
Actually I do, I really like Chopin.
Moonlight Sonata is my favorite classical song ever.
That is such a beautiful song yet so simple.
It's mesmerizing. I love The Phantom of the Opera.
Did you hear Sara Brightman's version of that song?
No I've never heard it before. Is it any good?
It's great, I love it. They put a little rock element into the song.
Oh that's so cool, I'll take a listen.
I also like Beethoven and his symphonies. What I would have given to be there while he was writing them.
Have you ever been to any operas?
Yes I saw Carmen live. It was okay but it was more boring than what I expected.
Oh that's surprising. I've never been to an opera but I've been to a symphony before.
So have I, it's amazing hearing so many instruments live.
Yes it is. I'd love to see The Color Purple the musical live.
I had a chance to see it but my friend backed out at the last minute.
Oh that's a shame. They're still doing shows though so you have a chance.
I'm gonna see it one day. That and the Lion King musical.
That one is highly successful. But then again the songs are great.
Yes just like Frozen it's hard to get the Lion King songs out of your head.
