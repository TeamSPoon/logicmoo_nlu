Did you like Nirvana?
Yeah, they were pretty good.
Pretty good? They were amazing.
I wouldn't go that far.
What do you mean, they had multiple hits.
Well after Nevermind and Smells Like Teen Spirit they kind of fell off.
Because Kurt Cobain died
Yeah, I guess that's right, but I don't think they had staying power.
Man I can't believe you.
Actually the best thing to come out of Nirvana was Dave Grohl
Oh yeah, he was their drummer
Yeah, I think they had multiple drummers before Dave
Right, but Grohl stayed on the longest.
Yeah and then went on to form Foo Fighters
Yeah, that's a pretty good follow-up act.
Yes, agree
Well at least you can agree that Nirvana created grunge rock.
Yes, they helped start that.
And move away from hair bands
Yes, give them credit for that one.
