Hey what is going on with you today?
Not much, just been trying to make me a new CD to listen to.
What kind of CD are you trying to make?
I'm wanting to do a CD dedicated to older female country music artists.
That's cool! What are some of the people that you have listen so far?
Right now I am searching for some good Faith Hill songs. Do you know her greatest ones?
There You'll Be, The Kiss, Breathe, It Matters To Me, Piece of My Heart, and The Way You Love Me always stand out to me.
Oh is There You'll Be the one that she did for the movie Pearl Harbor?
Yes!
I love that song. I will definitely have to add that one.
Who else are you looking for?
I am also wanting some good Shania Twain songs.
You're Still the One, From This Moment On, Any Man of Mine, That Don't Impress Me Much, and of course there is Man I Feel Like A Woman.
Wow, those are some awesome songs! I can't believe I have forgotten about so many of them.
Yeah her and Faith Hill are definitely two of the greats from a while back.
I would probably have to add Reba McEntire in that category as well.
Oh yes, I definitely agree with you on that one! She is really the only one of them who still does songs today.
What are some of her newer ones?
Going Out Like That, Just Like Them Horses, and Somebody's Chelsea.
I will have to give them a listen and maybe add some of the newer stuff as well.
