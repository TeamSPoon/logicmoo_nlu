Are you going to see Harry Potter and the Sorceror's Stone with the Symphony?
Yes.  I'm looking forward to the first glimpse of Hogwarts with a live orchestra.
I don't know.  I find the orchestra distracting.
I saw Back to the Future with live orchestra and it made it so much better.
Well, I never did see any of the Harry Potter films at the theater.  That would be a similar experience.
The special effects are even better in the theater.
I love it when they fly on brooms.
My favorite part are the spells.
I like in the first one when Hermoine corrects them on that levitation spell.
Yeah!  That part cracks me up.
