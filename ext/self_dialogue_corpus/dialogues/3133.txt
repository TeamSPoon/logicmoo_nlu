I'm ready for this NFL game party.
You get the chips?
Yes, of course!
Ok, let's wear our team uniforms.
Ok, let's do it!
I've got my Raiders cap on.
This game will be a good season finisher.
If the Raiders win!!
But they won't.
Oh, please.  We've got a brand new coach now.
What's your point?
We've got new ideas and concepts to beat y'all!
Give us a run for our money.
We didn't make the Superboel, but we will.
When?
One day.
Well, focus on winning for now.
Oh, we've got this.
Ok cool.
Party time!
