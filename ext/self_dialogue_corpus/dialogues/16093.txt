He is long gone off to a better place now, but what do you think of Elvis?
Oh, Elvis is amazing. An iconic rock and movie star even to this day. Of course to many people his memory is hard to let go.
I have a huge collection of Elvis vinyls and still slowly building it.
You do? My father had left me some old Elvis records after he passed. I never thought to let them go so I put them up in storage.
Storage? I have all mine in display in the den in my home. If fact my den is set up as an Elvis mini museum. So much memorabilia.
That sounds nice. Do you have old pictures of him as well?
I have just about everything. What are some of his songs that you like?
I like his more upbeat songs, like Jailhouse Rock,  Hound dog and of course Blue Suede Shoes.
I'm like minded but it's so hard to chose from one song to the next. He has starred in many classic movies as well.
Which one of those movies are your top favorites?
I would have to say my favorite, from the top of my mind, is the movie King Creole.
Oh, isn't that the one where he starred next to Carolyn Jones.
Yeah, he was a serious crooner in that movie. Who is Carolyn Jones?
If you remember the original Addams Family shows, well she played as Morticia  Addams.
Yes, I remember her in that show. She is a good actress. Carolyn worked well with Elvis. They really set off that movie King Creole.
I agree. But he has starred in many other great movies of the times. Jailhouse rock was a fun movie to watch.
Elvis almost portrayed himself in that movie. A young and upcoming rock star, who would know!
I think I'm going to pull the Elvis vinyl records I have from storage and donate them you for your museum.
Thank you. It will be to a good cause. Elvis songs need to be shared and never stored away.
You're right. Elvis is the man.
