Have you seen the Boss Baby movie?
No I have not.
I have.
Why?
I only seen it because my little niece likes it.
That's alright then.
Yeah I am not into pg or pg-13 movies.
Me neither.
What types of movies do you like?
I like mostly action.
There hasn't been any good horror lately, save for The Witch.
I seen it.
It was very good.
I agree, mostly horror movies are boring and predictable, I can''t take them seriously.
I think the horror genre in movies could use a significant upgrade in development.
So do I.
I enjoyed the theme and characters in The Witch.
So did I, also the soundtrack and picture were very engaging.
Yes sound plays a bigger part than most think.
I couldn't agree more.
