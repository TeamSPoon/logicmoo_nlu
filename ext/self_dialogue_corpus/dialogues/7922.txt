What are the key features of pop music?
The most important factor is theft.
What? What do you mean?
To me, the key to pop music is stealing all the cool things from the underground scene.
Give me an example.
Well, there's a lot more distortion in today's music. Consider, for example, the grunge genre.
Yes, so what?
Well, distortion is a key element of industrial music. And, that's been around for 100 years.
I see. Can you give me another example.
Sure. Processed vocals have been popular for a long time in the underground. And, they've started showing up in pop music recently.
