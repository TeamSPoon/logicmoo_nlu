Have you seen Adam Sandlers new movie  "Sandy Wexler"?
I just got thru watching it , like maybe an hour ago.
What did you think of it?
I liked it, just the right amount of Sandler comedey and a great plotline
I agree. I think this is one of his better movies since he started directing exclusively for Netflix.
I had heard he was thinking of doing that! I think it would give him the freedom to make movies the way he wants to make them.
There is no denying his brand and style. he played a really good 1970's hollywood talent agent.
I agree, I thought he was very believable. he seems to embrace roles that are closely associated to his ethnicity.
Not always, he Ridiculous 6 he was a native american.
yeah, wasn't crazy about it, I like Sandy Wexler much better.
what was your favorite part?
I liked when he had taken the girl to the park and was under the stars. I felt so sorry for him, she was clueless.
That was a good scene.
What was your favorite scene?
I like the very end where they thought they hd been married all  those years and come to find out they weren't.
There was a lot of big names that were telling their Sandy stories, i thought that was pretty cool.
what part did you hate?
I didn't like when they showed him at the hospital, it made me want to cry.
Do you think it was a mistake not to take that one to the big screen?
No, I think sandler is at a point in his carreer where it is more about the art and keeping his troop in cash.
