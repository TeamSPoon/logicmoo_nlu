Did you realize the very first Disney animations was probably Bambi?
yeah, it came out in 1942 and was considered to be an animated drama.
I know it's just a cartoon but it's so sad to me. Poor Bambi.
I know, but it's supposed to be kind of like the experiences of life. It's rough but it gets better.
He does make a lot of friends along the way.
Yeah, Thumper, Flower and Faline all become his friends.
I know. It's a good story. There were so many animators that worked on that movie too.
Yeah, that was when there was an art to the animation.
I have noticed in 80's the animation was looking sloppy. You tell it was 2 or more different artists drawing.
I know. Along with Snow White it was the golden age of animation, but the new digital technology is changing things fast...possibly bring us back to that original look and magic.
