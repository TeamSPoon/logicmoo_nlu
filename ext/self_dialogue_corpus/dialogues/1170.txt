Who do you have making the playoffs this year?
For the AFC or NFC?
Either one works. What teams will dominate in the NFL this season?
I think the Raiders, Patriots, and Seahawks will be the dominant teams.
What about the Ravens, Steelers, and Bengals?
They all reside in a tough division and they don't piqu√© my interest.
I think they might surprise you this year.
I think the Dolphins will surprise us.
The Dolphins look like they might be alright, perhaps this will be their year.
I love how the NFL has such high parity.
Well, except for the Patriots.
Of course, they are good every season.
Tom Brady really is a mastermind.
I heard he is coming out with a book about his fitness and mental health.
It looks interesting - might reveal how he has been so successful.
Yes, I think so. What do you think of the Revis situation?
I bet it is driving Belichick insane.
Yes, I bet it is.
He seems like a guy that worries over every detail.
He is meticulous and sly.
