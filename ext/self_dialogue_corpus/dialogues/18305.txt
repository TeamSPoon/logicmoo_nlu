Hey, do you like music?
Yeah, definitely. I like a lot of different genres, but right now I'm mostly into rap/hip-hop.
Oh okay, cool. I like rap, but I'm not a die hard fan.
That's cool. I usually look up songs on Youtube to listen to and watch if there's a video to go along with the song.
Yeah, I use Youtube a lot for that too, but I also buy songs off of iTunes as well. Speaking of which, I think Drake just dropped a new album.
I vaguely remember hearing something about that recently, but I'm not sure. I'm not a huge Drake fan.
He's not my favorite rapper, but he definitely has some catchy songs that are fun to listen to.
Yeah, I've heard a few of his songs. What artists do you like?
I like both old school and more modern rap, but lately I've mostly been listening to more recent rap.
Oh okay cool. Is there any reason you're gravitating to more recent rap at the moment?
It's just so new and fresh with a lot of unique acts. I love Migos and Rae Sremmurd a lot at the moment.
That's cool, I'm not too familiar with those artists.
You should definitely check them out some time. What music do you like?
I mostly like classic/hard rock from the 60s to the early 2000s.
Oh cool, yeah I like that genre too. What bands/artists do you like?
The usual acts like Led Zeppelin, The Who, Guns n' Roses, Red Hot Chili Peppers, etc.
I like all those bands. Do you like more recent stuff?
I do, but I don't know a lot of brand new bands or at least very recent bands.
One modern band I really like is twenty one pilots. They're incredibly talented and have a lot of creative songs.
I've heard of them and I might recognize a song or two if I heard it, but I don't really know much about them.
