Have you seen the new Beauty and the Beast live-action movie?
No, I haven't seen the live action version, but I love the original animated version.
Me too. But my all-time favorite Disney movie is Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.
Oh, yeah. That movie is a classic.
I was terrified of the evil queen when I was a kid!
Me too. I was also afraid of Ursula from The Little Mermaid.
Yeah, I thought she was pretty scary, too. What did you think of the stepmother from Cinderella?
The stepmother was mean. So were the stepsisters. But they weren't very scary.
I liked the Cinderella sequels where the one stepsister married the baker. She wasn't so mean after all.
She was just looking for love.
