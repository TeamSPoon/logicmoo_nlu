I saw a Punch Brothers concert yesterday.
Who are they? I haven't heard of them.
They're like an alternative bluegrass band.
What is alternative bluegrass?
It's music with traditional bluegrass instruments, but they play more rock-style music.
Oh, so which instruments do they have?
A banjo, acoustic guitar, acoustic bass, mandolin, and violin.
Awesome! Do they do any covers or songs I might know?
They cover a lot of rock bands like The White Stripes and The Strokes and Radiohead.
That sounds really good, I'm a big Radiohead fan.
Me too! My favorite song is 2+2=5!
That's a really good one! I like Packt Like Sardines in a Crushd Tin Box.
Punch Brothers covers that one!
So what are some other bands like Punch Brothers?
Like Nickel Creek, Mumford and Sons a little bit, Lake Street Dive, stuff like that.
And did you like the concert last night?
I loved it! They played some of their newer songs but also some old classics.
What's your favorite song by them? I'll look it up later!
My favorites are You Are, Magnet, Familiarity, and Rye Whiskey
Okay, thanks!
