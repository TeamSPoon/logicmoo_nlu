Did you know John Carter was a Disney movie?
No, was it really? I loved that movie.
I do too, I wish I could jump like John Carter.
I love that he choose the woman at the end, it was so romantic.
Taylor Kitsch is so good looking and he has a nice personality.
Yeah, that movie made over 284.1 million at the box office.
It is ridiculous how much it cost to make a movie so they deserve how ever much they make.
Disney makes the best movies and not just animated ones, which is great.
I know Below Eight, Freaky Friday, Remember the Titans, and the list goes on and on.
My grand-daughter's favorite is The Princess Diaries.
