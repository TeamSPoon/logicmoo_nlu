Have you seen Lady Gaga - G.U.Y. - An ARTPOP Film?
Yes, I enjoy it.
Me too but the opening reminds me of the simpsons episode where they think they found a fallen angel.
Funny That is kind of similar, I can see it now.
I like the whole concept a lot.
Her wings are beautiful in the film. I also enjoy everything at the main house/palace.
I really love the film, but I also love the lyrics and beat as well.
I like the part when she does like a voice over just talking about being guided.
I like the dance break when they are wearing white.
Overall a lot of thought went into it and I LOVE IT.
