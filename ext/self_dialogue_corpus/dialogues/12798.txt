They're making a Han Solo movie?
What?!
Yeah, it's another one of those "A Star Wars Story" movies.
That is so cool! Will Ford be in it.
No. Its set in the past. They're getting a young guy.
He'd better not foul it up.
You can say that again!
Who are they getting?
Alden Ehrenreich.
Never heard of him.
