What is your favorite comedy movie with zombies in it?
Definitely Zombieland.
Oh yeah, I haven't seen that movie in a long time.
No way? You should watch it again, its great.
Doesn't that have Woody Harrelson?
Yeah he played a really tough guy who lost his son.
Yeah that part was pretty sad.
I thought it was really sad how he pretended it was a dog at first.
Yeah it sucks the pain of losing someone is hard to own up to.
He really played that role well.
