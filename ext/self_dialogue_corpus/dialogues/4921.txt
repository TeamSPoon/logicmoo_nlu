Did yousee the reds ox game last night?
I did not, did you?
I did not either, I wanted to know if you knew the score. They are in Milwaukee right?
Yeah, playing the brewers.
Whats the name of the brewers stadium?
I'm not sure. I've never been.
How do you feel about the whole matt harvey thing?
I'm not really sure. It seemed weird that they suspended him like that. i don't know what he did.
Me either. He wasn't scheduled to pitch  that day.
Is he a starting pitcher?
I think so, for the mets.
How are the mets doing this season?
I think their team image is kind of suffering a bit with all this player drama.
I agree.
How do you feel about the racist comments that fenway fans made to jones the other night?
Totally horrible and uncalled for.
It makes me embarassed to eb a boston sports fan
I agree. I hate it.
At least fenway tried to make up for it.
How much can you really do though
