I really enjoy watching movies. I need to look up some classics.
What kind of movies do you like to watch?
All kinds, as long as they have a good story line.
Do you like comedies at all?
I love funny movies! Those are the best.
Which one would you say is your favorite?
That's a tough question because there are so many I like. I would have to say "Clueless".
Oh wow that is an old one!
Have you seen it?
Yes I have. Doesn't it have Stacy Dash in it?
It does I really like her.
I do too. It also has Alicia Silverstone in it too.
You're right! I loved that movie as a kid.
It also has that one chick in it who played in "8 Mile".
Who do you mean?
I think her name was "Brittany Murphy."
I remember her now! Didn't she pass away?
Yes unfortunately.
That's so sad. She was a pretty good actress.
I agree with you, she was.
