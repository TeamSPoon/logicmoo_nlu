Have you seen any sci-fi movies lately?
Yes, I watched Bokah, have you seen it?
Is that the one where the town disappears?
Yes, a couple on vacation wake up and nobodies there.
Was it good?
It was ok, I hate those kind of endings though.
Did you see The White King?
Yes, that was a weird one.
Yeah I didn't much like it either.
Did you see Arrival?
I watched some of it but fell asleep.
It wasn't that good anyways. Have you ever seen Caveman?
Yes I did, it was hilarious!
I know, that was so funny, they need to make another one with different stars now.
Yeah that would be a good idea, I would watch it.
Me too.  Have you seen The Astronauts Wife?
Yeah a long time ago.
I just saw it the other night, that was a weird one.
Yes it was a bit strange. It was ok, but just the same as all the other alien movies.
Yeah, they need to change up on the same ol' alien movies.
