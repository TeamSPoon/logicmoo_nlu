Man the Cubs are really struggling this year.
Yeah, I know it's like they have a hangover from last year.
But can you really blame them? I mean they finally won the World Series
True. And they will probably get a pass for the next 100 years.
You are probably right, but with that being said, they should be winning.
With all of the young studs on this roster, you would think they would get it together.
Yeah, but their starting pitching has to better.
No doubt about it. Their starting pitching is holding them back
Guys need to forget about last year and focus on the present
Why not focus and try to win a championship in back to back years
That would be phenomenal and the city of Chicago would go crazy!
True, but probably not as crazy as last year.
True. Those Cubbie fans were outrages last year.
But hey they deserved it. They came back from a 3-1 whole to win it all.
Yeah what an epic comeback agains the Indians
Now their city hasn't won a world series in like forever
Exactly. But I think there time has passed. The Yankees are the team to beat this year
Yeah looks like the Yankees have re-tooled.
That franchise doesn't stay down for long
You're right about that.
