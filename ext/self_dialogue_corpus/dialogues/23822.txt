Do you like horror movies?
They're okay.
My favorites are the Friday the 13th series.
Jason is all right. I like some of the Nightmare on Elm Street movies.
I like them too, but not the second one. That was just bad.
Yeah, the main character was too whiny.
It's sort of the black sheep of the series.
Robert Englund is always good no matter how cheesy it is, though.
Agreed.
I like the old ones a lot better than some of the franchises these days, like Saw.
Yeah, Saw is just a little to disgusting for the sake of being digusting.
Others are so forgettable, like the Final Destination series.
Yeah, a lot of modern movies are like that. Or they go too far like the Human Centipede.
Don't even get me started on Human Centipede. Just why?
And why a sequel? I think the filmmakers got too greedy.
Yeah, there was no way that shock value was going to last through a successful sequel.
At least there are still classics, like Halloween and Texas Chainsaw Massacre.
Those were pretty good.
You just don't see iconic characters like Michael Meyers anymore.
You certainly don't.
