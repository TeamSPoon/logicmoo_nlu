what film could you rewatch time and time again?
For me I would say Groundhog's day.
Well that certainly plays into the theme of the movie.
Ienjoy it everytime I watch it.
It is very rewatchable.
Bill murray is so good in it.
I enjoy his performances in all movies.
Yes how good is he in ghostbusters ?
Great. i also love him now like lost in translation is fantastic.
He really was brilliant in that one.
I think to be a great comic you have to be smart.
Lost in translation wasn't so much a comedy though.
Not in the same way as ghostbuster say but he is still a comic actor to me.
True and it did have moments.
Scarlet was also very good in lost in translation.
I enjoy her but thought murray stole the movie from her.
I think it belonged to both I mean it really was a duo.
It was a very focused look at the relationship.
Who directed it again?
I believe sofia coppola.
