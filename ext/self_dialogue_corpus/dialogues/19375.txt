do you like the rolling stones
yeah, but i like the beatles better
i like the stones better
why?
the stones were more raw.
they were less unique though.
they did steal alot from the blues
the beatles expanded music
they just didnt appeal to me as much
i get that
i liked the rock and roll bad feel of the stones
yeah, they were more rebels
the beatles were kinda hypocrites too
how so?
john lennon wasnt that peaceful
yeah, he wasnt a great person
he hit his wife
yeah, i heard about that
the beatles are good though
yup
