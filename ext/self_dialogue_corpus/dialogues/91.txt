Do you thin Michael Keaton will play a good villain in Spiderman?
Yeah I think he is a great actor.
But seeing him as Batman and now a villain will be weird.
How do you think?
I think people endear themselves to Batman.
That was so long ago.
Yeah true, I guess there is nothing to worry about.
Yeah you can put it out of your mind.
I cannot to be honest.
Well go in with an open mind.
