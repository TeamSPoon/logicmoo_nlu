59 days until the NFL season kicks off!  I can't wait!
I can, I'm a Cleveland Browns fan!  Our season is over before it even begins.
Ouch that does stink.  What do you think about the rookies they got.  They seem promising, no?
I don't mean to be pessimistic but the Browns never draft well.  If you are drafted by the Browns it's usually a ticket out of the league!
Talk about bad luck, let's talk about the Atlanta Falcons blowing that lead in the Superbowl.  Do you think they can overcome that?
Yikes.  They let New England score 31 unanswered points.  Not sure how any franchise moves past that.
They have a great quarterback in Matt Ryan.  Hopefully he keeps his head.
Julio Jones is an amazing receiver as well.  I thought for sure they would take down the Patriots!
Do you think Tom Brady really played with a concussion last year like his wife said he did?
I'm sure he did.  Although he is fairly protected with all the rule changes.  It's such a physical game.
Have you been following the legal troubles of Dallas's running back Zeke Elliott?
No I haven't.  What happened?  He was so fun to watch last year.
Supposedly he has some domestic violence charge against him.  It's too bad if it's true, he was great and will only get better.
I really enjoyed following Zeke and Dak's rise to the top.  They didn't do much in the playoffs though.  Same old Dallas.
How about Derek Carr's record breaking contract?
Oh my goodness 125 million dollars?!
He really came into his own last year.  And now that they have Beast Mode, maybe they will dethrown the Patriots.
Let's hope.  I have had enough of that dynasty.
Let's go out on a limb and say that we are going to see a Cleveland vs San Francisco Superbowl this year.
In your dreams.  They two worst teams in the league will not bounce back that fast.
