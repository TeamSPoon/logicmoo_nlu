Did you know the Parent Trap was a Disney movie?
I was unaware to be honest with you.
I didnt mind it at all.
The original or the newer one.
The original.
I thought it was a slick idea as far as the twins went.
The twins were actually only played by one person.
Yeah thats crazy they can do that.
I always wonder how that kind of scene is shot.
Its definitely a different and awkward way to film I am sure
