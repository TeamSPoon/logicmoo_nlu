So you didn't like Elf!?
I mean I did, I wasn't super into it.
Why not?
I think it was because it was a holdiday movie.
You don't like holdiay movies?
Not really, they're so lame most of the time.
So are you saying that you don't like the Home Alone movies?
Actually, those are exceptions haha. I love all of those,
Same! They're classics!
They are. & I watched them as a kid, so they're nostalgic.
