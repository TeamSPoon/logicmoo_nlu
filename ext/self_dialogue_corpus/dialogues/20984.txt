Do you ever watch older movies?
Yeah, alot, like which ones?
I like old movies about cars and racing. Do you like Caniball Run?
I do! Do you like some of Reynolds other work, like Smokey and the Bandit?
Yes. I like his obscure films too, like Navajoe Joe. Really good movie.
I love that one! There is Striptease too.
Good film, nut well know. What other sort of car movies do you like?
I like the actual movie, cars.The cartoon.
I did too, it was really good, if not silly. Did you see the second one?
No, I have heard of it, I like Driven too. Ever see it?
Yeah, I did once. I do not really recall it, did you think it was better than his other car movies?
It was just as good, just did not get the same press. He also did one called W.W and The DIxie DanceKings, similar movie.
I never saw that one. Was it funny or no?
It was, but it had its drama moments. Not unlike Hooper.
I forgot about that one. That was a really good one, like The End.
YEah, he also did real comedy in Mr.Bean.
Mr.Bean is always funny.
His movies remind me of the PInk PAnther
The new or old one?
Both really
