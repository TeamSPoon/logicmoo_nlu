I finally saw Light's Out!
By David F. Sandberg, starring Teresa Palmer?
Yeah but I never heard of those people before. Palmer was so cool, though, as the lead.
Did you notice her Sandman poster on the door? Best Easter egg of the year.
No, I didn't, but it's cool to have an alternative type strong female lead in horror.
I agree, and her boyfriend was kind of the damsel in distress!
Actually everyone was strong in their own way. I love when characters in a horror movie aren't useless.
Yeah, this movie did not feel like a slasher or an exploitation flick at all.
Is there another movie like that you would recommend?
Well, have you seen Hush?
