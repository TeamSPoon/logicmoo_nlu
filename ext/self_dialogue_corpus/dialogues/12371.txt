Who do you think would win in a lightsaber battle, Luke or Rey?
Obviously Rey.
Why? Luke has more practice.
Luke is also older, and Rey is already good without learning anything.
True. Still, I think Luke would win.
Actually, we're both wrong.
Why?
Yoda wins, obviously.
That's true.
Yoda always wins.
