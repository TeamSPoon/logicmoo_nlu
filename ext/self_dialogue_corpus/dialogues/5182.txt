Pinocchio might be the worst Disney film ever.
Heavens no.
I'll give it credit for being iconic, but the actual movie is dumb.
It's a classic with a classic message.
A message?  And what is that?
That anyone can be anything in life if they have the will and drive.
Even animated wooden boys?
Even animated wooden boys.
Oh, and watch out for strange men who will turn you into donkeys.
Well, you got me there in terms of what the message was.
