What do you think of the old school prog scene?
Like Pink Floyd, King Crimson, Yes, all of that?
Yeah, those are good examples of old school, high-concept prog.
I love it - I like the theatrical elements and odd and eclectic compositions
Definitely. I always liked Rush myself, especially the really early stuff like 2112.
Yeah me too. 2112 is a classic. Never felt the synth era though, around Signals.
Yeah the synth era was pretty different from the early stuff - I like guitar-based music in general so I agree with you
If it doesn't have noisy, dissonant guitar noise all over the place, it's not my kinda prog music
Ha, I hear that - I like music like that for the journey and I think dissonance and resolution are big parts of that.
I agree - progressive music is all about trying new things, breaking out of what's been established and moving forward.
