Who's your favorite hip hop artist?
My favorite all time hip hop artist is Nas.
I love Nas. Wasn't he married to Kelis, that singer?
Yes he was, they were married for some time.
I love the album Hip Hop is dead.
Right I loved the title song from that album.
He was really showing with that one that hip hop may be dead but not on his end.
That's true. Do you like Jay Z?
Well I like a few things of his, like Song Cry, but I like Nas better.
Right I don't know why they're always comparing the two.
Jay Z is no competition for Nas. He buried Jay Z with his diss song Ether.
That will be the all time greatest diss song.
What other hip hop artists do you like?
Well I like Kendrick Lamar. He seems to be one of the only ones reviving the genre.
Right he got a lot of great reviews on his latest album.
Oh I remember Facebook was going crazy about it.
They're comparing him to all the greats of the past.
He did a performance at the grammys that was pretty controversial.
I saw that performance and I can see why it was.
Logic is another great artist who isn't getting a lot of attention.
