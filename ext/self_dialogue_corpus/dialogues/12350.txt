I read that the guy who did Darth Vader's voice got paid a good deal to not do much work.
Do you mean James Earl Jones?
Right.  He only made $7,500 for Star Wars.
That's still decent money for sound work.
Yeah, it only took him 2.5 hours to be done.
Uh, that's a pretty darn great hourly wage.
Yeah, but when you think about royalties and other things he missed out on, it's nothing.
I'm sure he was able to negotiate better terms going forward.
I'm sure he was, just thought it was interesting.
Someone should pay me that much!
