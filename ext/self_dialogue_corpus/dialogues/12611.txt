You know what else is weird?
Here we go again
Why does Darth Vader have to wear a mask? He was only burned
What?!?!?!
He was only burned by the lava. No burn victims have to live with masks. The real reason he has a mask is because th voice of what's his name had to be used.
James Earl Jones. You think of the weirdest things.
But it bothers me.
Well, whatever the reason. Darth Vader has a mask.
But for a wrong reason. That's not right.
Well it's dramatic, and it looks cool. And makes that cool breathing noise.
