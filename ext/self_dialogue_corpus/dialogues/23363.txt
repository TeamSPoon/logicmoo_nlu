So any new natural disaster movies?
I don't know about natural disaster but I know plenty of artificial disasters.
What do you mean by artificial disaster movies?
well, it seems hollywood is too eager to end the world.
Yes, I agree. Hollywood seems to be trying hard to end the world.
Seriously! I mean there are so many end of the world movies that it doesn't even click anymore.
Well, you know that hollywood has habit of overdoing stuff which sells it you develop aversion of the same stuff.
I completely agree with you. Another thing is that the CGI effect seems to such in most such movies.
Yes exactly. Reminds me of 2012.
Oh, yes! CGI effects in that movie was so artificial that it almost looked like an animation movie.
I remember, there was so much hype about 2012 movie, But it ended up being a great disappointment.
Same thing happened with independence day resurgence.
I think people are fed up with all these end of world movies.
Yes, because there are so many that it has become boring now.
I think the reason the first independence day movie was successful was because it was the first movie to show end of world theme.
Yes, at that time it was a new thing, so it was exciting. Now it has become really boring.
I hope hollywood learns  it lesson and stop overdoing same theme again and again.
I am skeptic about it. I don't think hollywood is going to learn anything.
well, then I guess people have to teach them, if they are not ready to learn by themselves.
That would require unity of all movie watchers, which I find really rare to happen
