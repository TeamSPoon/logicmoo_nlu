So why do you think the directors chose to split the Deathly Hallows book into two separate movies?
I think it's because so much happens in the book that they wanted to try to fit everything in.
Do you have a favorite movie between the two?
I think I like the Deathly Hallows, Part 2 a little bit better. There's more action.
I'm on the opposite side. I like Part 1 a little bit more.
Oh yeah? Why is that?
I think there's a lot of character development, and there's a great scene when Harry and Hermione are dancing together in the tent.
I do like that scene a lot. But I like even more at the end of the second movie when Hagrid is carrying Harry and everyone thinks he's dead, but he's actually alive.
I thought that part was a little bit cheesy, to be honest.
I think all of the movies have been a little bit cheesy, but they're true to the books for the most part which is what matters.
