Did you ever see Forgetting Sarah Marshall?
I did watch it on Netflix.
What did you think?
Extremely funny.  So many great lines and sight gags.
I couldn't believe some of the nudity though.
Yeah, that was pretty surprising.
I thought Mila Kunis was hilarious in it.
Yeah, I didn't expect her to have a comedic touch.
Being easy on the eyes helps too.
I'll say!
