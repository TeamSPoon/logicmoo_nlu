Hey buddy, are you excited for the upcoming season?
You know it! The Giants have been on a tear with acquisitions this offseason!
True, but Wentzylvania got some weapons this off-season! Alshon and Torrey Smith, I think the Eagles are gonna be great!
No way, man, the Eagles? When was the last time they won a ring? The first Super Bowl was before the Eagles' roster was even born.
We...don't have one. But hey, the NFC East is looking weaker too, right?
You must be praying for Zeke to get hurt, we're both in trouble with that 1-2 punch in Dallas.
This is true, but hey, they'll lose in the playoffs like they did to Green Bay last year!
That Aaron Rodgers is a BAAD man, definitely 1st QB off the board in fantasy this year. Detroit's just praying for no more Hail Marys.
Speaking of which, have you talked to the commissioner about doing our fantasy league again this year? I need to defend my crown
Oh, without a doubt! He told me the draft will be next month, who you got first?
Easily Antonio Brown, the best wide receiver in all of the NFL, stat-machine.
I don't know man, Big Ben is reaching the end of his rope, you think he'll hold up?
Easily, I think the Steelers have a couple more runs in them, especially with their weak division.
Poor Cleveland, think they'll struggle again?
Probably, they had a strong draft but they're a few years away from being competitive, barring bad luck.
For sure, who's your sleeper this season?
The Tennesee Titans, they are certainly underrated coming into the season and adding more weapons, how about you?
I'd have to say the Arizona Cardinals, they've got a strong core who had an off-year, I think they'll be back to the Big Dance.
Wow, bold call, but it's been a pleasure, I must be going, i'll see you at the draft!
Same to you, very fun. Talk to you soon!
