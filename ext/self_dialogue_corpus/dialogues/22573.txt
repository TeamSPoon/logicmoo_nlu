Have you seen any movies this year that pass the Bechdel test?
Hm. I guess Wonder Woman did.
Oh yeah. But it seems like only at the beggining.
Right. because she was on an island full of women.
After that it was a pretty dude centric movie.
For a movie about wonder woman, yes you're right.
Even the other evil lady doesn't have many lines.
Who played her?
A spanish actress named Elena Anaya
She was pretty wonderful
She was compelling. I liked that wonder woman doesnt kill her
I suppose. I kind of thought she should have though
Right. The moral part maybe shouldn't have won out.
Who played the lead male in that?
Chris Pine.
He was pretty funny
Yeah he has good timing for sure
I laughed despite myself in some places.
Gal Gidot was perfect I think
Yeah. She did the best she could
