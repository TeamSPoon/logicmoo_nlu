I was speaking to a friend during the week about the new 2 Chainz album.
Oh, that one. I thought it was awful.
That's exactly what I said. He didn't take too kindly to it.
I take it that means he's a fan.
Yeah. He's actually been listening to him for over 5 years.
How can you go for so long with such bad music?
Again, that's what I'm saying.
I mean, we do have to respect others' opinions.
That's true. I didn't consider that when confronting my friend.
He'll get over it soon.
