Who is your favorite character in the movie Frozen?
My favorite character would probably be Anna.
What about Elsa?
I like Elsa, but as a younger sibling myself, I identify with Anna more.
I like Elsa better because of her ice powers.
Do you think in the next movie, Anna will get powers too?
Probably not, I heard in the next movie Olaf is going to have a bigger role.
Oh really? I didn't really like Olaf's character.
I didnt like Olaf either, I found his character annoying.
Me too, but children like his character, and the movie is most popular with kids.
