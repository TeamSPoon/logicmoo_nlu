What's your favorite classic rock band?
I would probably say it was Led Zeppelin.
They were really great and made great music.
Yeah my favorite song from them is Black Dog. Great song. Mine is Mist Mountain Hop.
Wouldn't it be great if they played a final concert?
Sure except that John Bonham is dead.
True but his son Jason plays the drums and could sit in his place.
That would be a pretty amazing concert to see.
It sure would be a packed stadium for sure.
I hope it happens one day soon.
