Hey man, you like Lady Gaga?
Nah not really.
Why not?
Because all her songs are just weird, like for the applause!
That one isn't that great, what about Bruno Mars?
Eh he's a bit whiney
How so?
Like that song, Lazy song where he doesn't do anything that day, boring and whiney
Fair enough, what about Thousand Foot Krutch
Oh I love them
You like that sound, Rawkfest?
DUDE that's my jam!
I love me some Skillet too
Man their new album is great!
I love that song, Stars
For a slow song, it's actually pretty good.
That and Monster!
Man I could head bang to that for days
Now I wanna go to a Skillet concert
We should go!
