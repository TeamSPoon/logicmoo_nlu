What's your favorite NFL team for the coming season?
I don't know. I haven't been keeping up with them.
What, really? Well, who do you like in terms of players?
How about Kirk Cousins?
Kirk Cousins is good, he played for Michigan State University.
What is he doing now?
I think he's still the quarterback with the Washington Redskins...
I think that sounds right.
And, he is doing really well these days!
Really? That's cool!
They didn't want to play him much at first.
Why wouldn't they do that?
Apparently, the team thought a lot of other guys were better.
Didn't he end up playing after a couple of the main quarterbacks got injured or sidelined?
Yes, that sounds about right.
Well, Kirk Cousins definitely showed the fans that he's got it going on!
That's so true, they didn't know how good he was until he finally got his foot in the door.
That just goes to show that stats aren't always the best predictor.
Definitely, if more teams gave the back-up quarterbacks a chance, there would be more diamonds in the rough!
Then again, when you are at the level of the NFL, you're already the top of the top, so being able to get the foot in the door is the most important thing!
