You like Peter Jackson movies?
Yes. Lord of the Rings is my fave.
Have you seen his earlier films?
I don't think so. Like what?
The Frighteners, for one. There's also a really twisted bizarre puppet film called Meet the Feebles. I don't recommend it.
Why?
Well, I don't recommend it unless you are not at all easily offended and you want to see something that is beyond weird.
Oh, okay.
My favorite film of his is called Heavenly Creatures.
What is that about?
It's the true story of two girls from New Zealand. It's about their friendship.
Sounds uneventful.
No. It's eventful. I just don't want to spoil it for you.
Well, I probably won't ever see it.
It's about two girls who are both extremely creative and very much drawn together in a very intense way.
Oh. So it's like a lesbian love movie?
No. Not really. It's an intense friendship. But an intense female friendship being perceived as being romantic love by others does play a part in the plot.
So, I was kind of right.
It was Kate Winslet's first film.
I loved her in Titanic.
