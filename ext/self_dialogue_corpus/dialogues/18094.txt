What kind of music do you like to listen to on a rainy day?
Well it depends if I want to be in flow with nature or I want to be energetic.
Yes I can see your point.
That would be a good thing for a trivia night.
What are you talking about?
Name as many songs as you can that have something to do with the weather.
Okay let's do it right now and see how far we can get. You start.
Easy. Raindrops Keep falling on My Head...B.J. Thomas
Oh and the artist..nice. I'll give you an extra point for that!
Here Comes The Sun (and I say, it's alright)...Beatles
I Made It Through The Rain...Manilow
Obscure! I'll give you 2points for that one
I Canâ€™t Stand The Rain....Tina Turner
Have you ever heard her do that buddhist chant she does?
No I haven't.
It is so awesome.The chant is Nam Myoho Renge Kyo
Well that isn't something I would have expected to be talking about today a buddhist chant.
Look it up and try it the sounds that it generates in the body are wonderful to feel.
I am going to go do that right now.
There may be a version with some back ground music
