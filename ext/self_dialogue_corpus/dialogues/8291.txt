Who's your favorite artist in pop music?
It's difficult to say, but I had a crush for Avril Lavigne long time ago when I was in middle school
no way, I loved her music as well
yea, her street style appearance and good beats just got my heart when I was in my teenager years
you know what she's doing recently?
I'm not really sure, she's a married woman now, I think she's dedicating her life to being a good wife
well, it's both beautifuil and kinda sad, I miss her already
well, she's still publishing music, just not as fast rate
like what?
you know her song was featured as the main theme from Alice in Wonderland?
