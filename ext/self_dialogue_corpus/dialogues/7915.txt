Who is the best pop artist out right now?
Tough to say between Bruno Mars and Beyonce.
How about Nicki Minaj?
I would say shes more of a rapper.
Or Katy Perry?
No she is not that big
Thats crazy she had her own Super Bowl performance
I think thats terrible.
That she performed?
No that you wouldnt listen to her as one of the top pop performers.
