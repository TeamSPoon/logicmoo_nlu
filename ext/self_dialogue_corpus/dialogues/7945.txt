Do you like Ed Sheeran?
Of course! It's legally required to think of him as perfect.
That's kind of sadly true, actually.
Yeah, people go crazy for him.
I'm not the biggest fan.
Why not?
Well, I recognize his talent for sure, he's a good singer.
But..?
But his melodies don't work. They jump around too much.
Seriously! Ever hear people try to sing along to Shape of You? It's like a wrong-note-festival!
