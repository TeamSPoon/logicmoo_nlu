What was your impression of the Toy Story series?
Oh, they were fun and entertaining to watch.
I watched two of them, haven't caught up with the latest.
You should watch it before the latest releases.
What? Another is in the pipeline?
Yes, set for release some time around July 2018
Well I have time to catch up then. What will be the story in the latest movie?
Heard there might be a love story between Woody and Bo Beep.
Really? I love all the characters of Toy Story.
They sure give a new meaning to toys, don't they?
