Have you ever seen Ghost Dog, the movie?
No I've never even heard about it.
It is really great.
What is it about?
It is about the street samurai type guy, stoic yet intelligent and caring.
That is an interesting premise to a movie.
Yes and there is even a little bit of the Wu Tang Clan in it.
Ah I have heard of them.
The movie is truly unique, a great look at a man's life.
Wow that sounds great, thank you for telling me.
