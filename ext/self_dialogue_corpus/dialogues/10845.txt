Do you think the Fast and The Furious is still relevant?
There are really just a lot of them.
Do you like the new ones?
I like the Rock, he makes them a bit more fun.
I think he makes the movies a bit silly.
He adds comic relief.
Since he started them, with his one liners they are way less serious.
I think they went down hill when Paul Walker passed away.
He made the movie more worthwhile.
I miss that guy, his story line was always the most full.
