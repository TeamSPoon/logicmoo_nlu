What do you think about the new Beauty and the Beast?
Like, does it compare to the original? I'm not sure.
I think it's got its own appeal. But the animated one will always be classic.
I agree. I think I still know all the words to the songs!
I definitely know all the words. Who can forget them?
Yeah, when Belle is dancing with the Beast and Mrs. Potts is singing.
Just thinking about it makes me feel nostalgic.
I should see the new one! Just to see if it compares.
Yeah, go see it and let me know what you think.
Will do!
