You know, pop music in the 80s was really good.
Oh, I know. Prince is one of my favorite artists.
He was one of the best, especially his album Purple Rain.
I love that album! "When Doves Cry" is one of the best songs ever.
Yeah, I really like that one. I also like the title track.
Oh, of course! "Purple Rain" is a beautiful song.
What about his later stuff? Are you into that?
Very much so. He did a song about 10 years ago called "Guitar" that I couldn't get enough of.
Really?
Yeah, you should check it out sometime!
