I saw A Tribe Called Quest at FYF this year. They were incredible.
You did? I missed it! Low End Theory is one of my favorite albums.
Yeah, they were sick, even though Phife Dawg is gone now.
R.I.P. Phife man. That made me really sad!
Me too. But still, they really killed it. I was dancing my butt off when they dropped Left My Wallet in El Segundo.
That's one of my favorites too. I heard Missy Elliott was also really good.
Yeah, she was also pretty good. She played a lot of songs from The Cookbook.
My favorite album by her is Da Real World. So many classics on that one!
You should go next year, I heard De La Soul and the Pharcyde were jealous and wanted to do a back to back set.
Sick man! They should get The Jungle Brothers and A Tribe Called Quest again and really throw an amazing show!
