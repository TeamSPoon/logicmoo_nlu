I just read that paul mccartney didn't know he was on a rihanna song.
What he was? Like a sample?
No his guitar playing was on her track.
How does that happen?
Well I guess kanye west had reached out to work with paul. He was hesitant but did it.
so how did he not know?
Well he was working with kanye separately.  Kanye speed up his guitar track so paul did not even realize at first it was him.
Crazy, kanye seems sneaky.
A bit.Paul did not even know Rihana was going to be involved at all.
Well I had no clue he was on any song of hers. Different but interesting collaboration.
