Whats your favorite song by Snoop Dogg?
I would have to say Drop it like its hot.
Yeah, that's my favorite too.
He was really on the grind back then with that song.
He had a good flow i think Pharrel was on the track as well.
Yeah he was. That is what made it vibe so well.
Yeah i agree.
Do you like any other of his songs.
Yes I do.
What are they?
