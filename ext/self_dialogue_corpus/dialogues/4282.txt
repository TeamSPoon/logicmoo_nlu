Hey have you ever seen The Talented Mr. Ripley?
No why?
It's a really great thriller. It came out a while ago but it's a great movie.
Is it scary?
No but it's very intriguing.
What's it about?
A con artist who sort of infiltrates a group of rich young adults.
Is there a lot of gore?
No, not at all.  There's one scene with a bit of blood but nothing too bad.
Okay, great, I'll check it out.  Thanks!
