Do you like older music
like how old
say 70's
sure I love 70's music
what is your favorite
maybe not my favorite but I love Bread
oh yes I wanna make it with you
love that song
they were always a group that would add to your depression
you got that right
Diana Ross is great
Ain't No Mountain High Enough
The Beatles
Let it Be is a classic from the 70's
it sure is
I also like Tony Orlando, I know they are not classic but I always loved the music
I think they are good Tie a Yellow Ribbon and Candida
The Jackson 5 were popular in the 70's too
I never cared for them until Michael grew up
I know how you feel but still love the Jackson 5
