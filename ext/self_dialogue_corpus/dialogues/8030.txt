Have you heard Despacito?
Uh no, who is that by?
Daddy Yankee, some other Latin artist, and Jusitn Bieber.
I don't know who Daddy Yankee even is.
He sang that Gasolina song.  Also, Rompe.
Yeah, I still don't know who he is.
Anyway, the Despasito song seems like it shouldn't work on paper, but its pretty good and I really like it.
I've heard it, I'm not crazy about it.
This song taught me what despasito means.
Doesn't it just mean slowly?
