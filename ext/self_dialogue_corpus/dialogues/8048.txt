Do you like the Chainsmokers?
I find myself liking some of their songs.
Are you a fan?
I wouldn't say that.  I mean I thought Selfie was stupid.
Oh, I did too.  It was catchy though.
It was.  It was pretty annoying though.
So, do you like Closer?
Yes!  The first time I heard it, I was like "What is that?"
Yeah, it has a great flow.
Yeah, it's pretty chill.
