Did you get to listen to Lady Gaga's album called the Remix?
When did it come out?
March 3, 2010 is when it came out.
I think I have heard some of the songs from it, if Poker Face was on it.
Yes , that is definitely on that album.  Another one is Dance in the Dark.
Just Dance is also on it , and that is one of the best songs she ever did.
It is a great pop dance song for sure.
The label was Streamline for that production of the album.
She is one of my favorite singers.
She is also extremely wealthy!
