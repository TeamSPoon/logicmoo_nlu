Have you seen all the Lethal Weapon Movies.
Yes, I have seen them all at least twice.
Which one is the best?
That is hard to say. I like the first one because it really sets up the characters.
Is Joe Pesci in that one?
No, he was introduced in Lethal Weapon 2. He was a witness that had to be protected.
Is he in any others?
He is in all of them after the second one. He provides a lot of humor.
I think I will check them out.
Great. Just start with the first one and watch them all!
