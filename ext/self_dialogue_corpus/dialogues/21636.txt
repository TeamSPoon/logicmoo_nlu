Have you seen any films lately?
No, I haven't. But I really want to go see Moonlight.
That sounds familiar to me. What is it about?
It explores how the identifies of being a black man and also being gay intertwine for the main character, Chiron.
That sounds very interesting! Who does it star?
The main characters are supplied by Mahershala Ali and Ashton Sanders.
Sounds great. Maybe we should go see it together some time?
That's a good idea! What films have you seen lately?
I saw Wonder Woman last week in theaters!
I've heard some mixed reviews about that movie. How was it?
It was incredible. It was like the movies were brought to life!
Oh wow, that's really cool. Who are the main stars?
Gal Gadot and Chris Pine.
Chris Pine is one of my favorite actors, I'll have  to go see it! What is it about?
It details all of the trials Wonder Woman, aka Diana, princess of the Amazons, goes through on her attempts to save the worlds.
Sounds like a great blockbuster superhero movie!
Yep, it sounds like it. And I think it has one of your favorite actors in it, from the Harry Potter universe.
Who? Remus?
Yep, David Thewlis!
Now I have to see it!
