Do you like Lady Gaga's newer music or her greatest hits?
I haven't heard her newest stuff, so I guess I like her greatest hits best.
So which is your favorite song of hers?
Just Dance.
Yeah, me too.
That was my jam back when we would go out dancing in college.
I remember they would play it like 2 or 3 times a night.
Yeah, eventually I got burnt out on it, but now I like hearing it every once in a while.
Does it still make you get up and dance?
Yeah, her voice and the driving rhythm still get me up and dancing.
