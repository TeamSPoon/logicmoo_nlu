I was thinking of recording a song and putting it on YouTube.
Why?
Just to see what would happen.
Do you think you're going to get discovered or something.
Well it has happened before.
I know. Justin Bieber is a really good example of that.
He was only twelve years old when he first started posting them.
OK, so it worked for him, but who else got their start on YouTube?
How about Cody Simpson?
He got his start on YouTube?
Yes.
I didn't know that.
And don't forget about Susan Boyle.
Wasn't she from Britain's Got Talent?
Yes. When her performance of I Dreamed a Dream posted on YouTube, it went so viral.
I remember when it happened. I checked out the video and was amazed by her voice.
See, it can happen.
So you think it's going to happen to you?
Not really. I just think it would be fun to try.
Tell me if you do and I'll give it a like.
