How do you like action movies in general?
oh yeah, I love them, time for some more explosions
when it comes to visual effects, such as explosion, who comes to your mind first?
it has to be Michael Bay, who's most famous for his Transformer movies, where mass destruction took place
I agree, no matter how others judge the nature of his movies, you can't deny the explosions, haha
so which transformer movie is your favorite?
I believe it was the second one that draws most of my attention, the college kid one
oh, I think I know what you talking about, it's a conspiracy theory about The Pyramid in Egypt, isn't it?
yeah, in the movie, the pyramid has some hidden device that can be used to destroy our sun
that sounds terrifying
