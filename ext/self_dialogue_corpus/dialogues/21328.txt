Have you seen any movies lately?
I just saw Moonlight, I know I'm a little behind.
What did you think of it?
I really liked it! Although it made me profoundly sad.
I'm sorry to hear that. What other movies have you seen lately?
I want to see hidden Figures but I havent gotten around to it.
Oh! That was amazing! You should see it!
Ok, I'll try!
I heard they are making a movie version of Hamilton. How do you feel about that?
I think it's kind of silly to be honest.
Why?
Because they are just trying to capitalize on something that doesn't need to be changed.
Fair. I think it will still be good though.
I guess we will have to wait and see.
What is your favorite movie genre?
I really like scary movies and psychological thrillers.
Me too! I have sci fi movies and action movies.
I like action movies but not really sci-fi movies.
Would you like to go see a movie with me later?
Sure!
