Do you know anything about folk music?
Is that what Bob Dylan sings?
Yes, kind of. It's fair to consider him a folk singer, or a singer in the folk tradition.
I've listened to a little bit of Bob Dylan, but aside from that I don't know much about folk music.
Did you ever hear anything by Woody Guthrie?
The name sounds familiar, but that's about all I can say.
I guess it's worth noting that we've been talking about American folk music, but many nations and peoples have a tradition of folk music.
That makes sense. I can remember going to a Greek Festival and listening to Greek music that might have been folk music.
It probably was.
So, in a sense, is most non-pop music folk music?
I don't think that's quite accurate.
The what makes folk music folk music?
I'd say that in order to be folk music, the song must have some kind of evolution within an oral tradition.
Meaning what?
That it wasn't written down or formally composed, that it was taught by being sung from person to person.
Ah, I see. Music imparted traditionally.
Often times, yes. A lot of folk songs, it's not even known who the original composer/writer is.
I also think about a single performer, usually playing an acousitc guitar and singing.
That's definitely the image of American Folk Music, though other countries are quite different.
It hearkens back to a time when music was less of a commercial enterprise.
