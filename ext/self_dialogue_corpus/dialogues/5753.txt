Hey, which Disney movie do you like better: Mulan or The Little Mermaid?
Mulan, definitely! The Little Mermaid was kind of lame.
I like The Little Mermaid better, Ariel was very pretty.
Yeah, but she fell in love with Prince Eric as soon as she saw him!
Well, I guess she was a little desperate.
Mulan, on the other hand, saved the entire country of China! And what did Ariel do? Nothing!
Sheesh, okay!
Sorry. I respect your opinions, but Mulan was still better!
Okay, okay!
Sorry. They were both good.
