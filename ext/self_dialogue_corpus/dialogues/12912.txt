We need more Chewbacca backstory!
We need Chewbacca to be more in the stories period!
I agree, although people tend to feel that an over exposure of Chewie in the movies would ruin his mystery.
I don't agree with that at all. I think Chewbacca is a really interesting character. He's strong, brave, and so loyal!
Did you cry when he screamed in pain after Han died?
I knew exactly how Chewie felt. It was like he lost a brother not just a friend.
Han and Chewie were basically family. All the adventures they went through.
I know. Chewie is awesome. He's like the big protective uncle in every family.
The cool uncle you knew would have your back and help you out with things your own father wouldn't let you do.
That's a bit much, but yeah, Chewie needs his own story so us fans can really learn more about his background!
