I'm really glad Force Awakens and Rogue one were good films.
Same, having Star Wars back and having it be good is a relief.
Did you think they would be bad films?
Not really, but deep down you never know, look at the prequels.
I think being owned by Disney ensures we'll never see something that bad.
True, same ended up happening with Marvel.
Yeah the quality control is off the charts here, budget is there, talent is there.
Do you think we'll suffer from too much Star Wars though?
You mean like the Marvel fatigue?
Yeah it feels like there's a new Marvel movie every day.
Star Wars is a special kind of magic though, once a year isn't fatigue.
But even discounting the movies, it's everywhere.
Star Wars being everywhere is a good thing in my book.
I guess you're right, I'm just hoping it maintains its integrity.
You see the new posters for The Last Jedi?
I saw the headlines that they were out, but not yet.
You have to, they look so good.
Will look them up as soon as I can, who is on them?
Just about everybody, there's a really heartbreaking one of Luke and Leia.
Oh man I don't think I'm ready for that.
