So what is your favorite Disney movie?
That is a hard question, probably The Lion King!
That is a good one, why do you like it?
I love the story, but also the music is great.
Yes it is, I like Can You Feel The Love Tonight, which is your favorite song?
My favorite is probably I Just Can't Wait To Be King, but that is a hard question.
My favorite Disney movie is probably Beauty and the Beast.
Cool, the cartoon or the new live action one?
The cartoon, such as classic. The music is just so wonderful.
I agree, the new one was good, but never as good as the original.
