Are you going to see Cars 3 this summer?
No, I don't think so. Are you going to see it?
I might. I think the graphics look awesome.
Yeah, I agree the graphics do look cool. I just think they need to be done with the Cars movies.
I'm willing to give Cars 3 a chance. Toy Story 3 ended up being one of the best movies, so maybe this will be okay.
Yeah, but Toy Story 2 was also good. Cars 2 wasn't that great.
I'm thinking maybe Pixar and Disney learned from their mistakes in the second Cars movie.
I hope so, otherwise Cars 3 will be even worse than Cars 2.
I bet Disney doesn't care though. The franchise is probably meant for kids who don't care much about the plot anyways.
You're probably right about that.
