Can you see a fourth Hangover movie being made?
Possibly but I dont know which actor would do it.
I think they would all get back together.
I dont think so, the third one bottomed out.
They used the same jokes the entire time.
Yeah that and the acting was campy.
I think Ed Helms is overrated and boring.
He is type-caste and needs to embrace that
I wouldnt want to but I guess so
He makes enough royalties to not need the other stuff.
