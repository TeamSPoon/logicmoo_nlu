Can you believe those Colorado Rockies?
What about them?
They're playing really well right now
The Colorado Rockies?
Yeah, I couldn't believe it either.
When was the last time they played well?
It's been awhile, I can't remember for sure
Didn't they go to the World Series one year?
Yeah, but I believe they were swept
Do you remember who they played?
I think it was the Boston Redsox
Oh yeah, that's right. Back in 2007.
Yeah that's right
Terry Francona was the Red Sox coach
Yeah, that's right..I remember Curt Schilling was still pitching for the Red Sox back then
Curt Schilling!!! Man, he's a nut job now.
Yeah, he's kind of become a political talking head
So, the Rockies are playing well now eh?
Yeah, best record in baseball right now
Crazy, I don't remember them ever playing that well
