Man these movies blow
What ones
The chronicles of riddick ones
How do they blow
They are so boring
How are they boring
The plot is just bad
I seem to like the plot
Well it is simple minded
Nah not at all
Yes it quite is
Explain
It follows cliched beats
And
That is a bad thing
How is it a bad thing though
Because cliched is not good
I mean it can be
Can?
Sometimes familiar is good
