Do you think the new Black Panther will be good
No, people dont know enough about his character.
No one knew anything about Ironman or  Thor either.
They had introductions to them.
Yeah but not like a cameo in a movie.
You dont need that all the time.
OK I guess you are half right.
They saw enough of him to know why hes mad.
He doesnt need to be mad right.
I think it plays better.
