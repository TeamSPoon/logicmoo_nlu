Hey, are you excited that it is finally the weekend?
Yes! This has felt like a really long week.
Do you have any exciting plans?
Not by normal standards, but I am excited about!
Okay, now you have me curious, what are you doing?
I am going to binge watch all four seasons of Orphan Black on Amazon Prime.
Why are you doing that?
Because the final season starts on June 10th.
What is the show about?
It is about a girl who find out she is a clone.
Oh, so like science-fiction?
Yeah - but there is so much more to it than that. Lots of rich characters, the actress is amazing.
Actress? So like one person does all the characters?
Well, all of the clones, yes.
How many clones are there?
Loads of them, but there are four main ones that are in almost all the episodes. A science geek, a soccer mom, and the main character who is just like a strong, ballsy woman.
That is only three. I thought you said four?
Well that one is hard to explain without giving mega spoilers. Season one she is attempting to kill all the clones because she has been brainwashed.
This show seems really complicated.
It really isn't once you start watching it.
