How well do you think the Carolina Panthers are going to do this 2017 season?
I don't know. They didn't do so well this past season.
Yeah ever since that fatal championship loss against the Denver Broncos in 2015 they just gave up.
I hear you. But I heard that they got a new running back named Christian McCaffrey.
I heard that too! He's supposed to be a top notch running back. He was drafted in the first round.
There may be hope after all for the panthers! Isn't there another new player?
Yeah his name is Curtis Samuel his a second round wide receiver pick.
I've heard of him before, he's supposed to be really explosive when it comes to working with running backs.
The only downside is that my favorite player is no longer with the Panthers.
Who is that?
Mike Tolbert. He was the Fullback for the Panthers.
What team is he playing for now?
I heard he is playing with the Buffalo Bills now, in the same fullback position.
Do you know when their first game is?
Yeah it is in California. They are playing the 49ers on September 10th.
Hey thats pretty close to us! We should make a road trip to go see them.
Sounds good! They play around 4:25pm so we can take off after work.
Yeah we will make it on time. What is the stadium called?
It's Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, California.
Dully noted! Thanks.
