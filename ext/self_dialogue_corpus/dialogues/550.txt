I am bored, do you want to do something?
Like what? I am actually kind of bored myself.
I have a few sports trivia games if you would like to play.
Are there any NFL questions involved?
I have not played in a while, but I think there are some.
The NFL is my favorite sport by far.
Mine to! I love watching the NFL more than anything else on television!
Cool, what a coincidence!
Me and my dad have always argued about who the best quarterback of all time is.
In my personal opinion that would be Peyton Manning.
No way! The best quarterback of all time is Dan Marino.
Well, who does your dad think it is?
He says Joe Montana, but he is a big San Francisco 49ers fan.
Then he might be a little bit biased in his opinion then!
That is what I always say to him as well.
I feel like Peyton Manning controlled games like no other quarterback in NFL history has ever done before.
He was great in terms of making adjustments at the line of scrimmage, but his performances in the playoffs hold him back in this argument.
That is true, however, I would take John Elway before Marino. He has two rings to prove my point.
I do not think rings should matter when talking about the best Quarterback of all time.
I feel like they separate the true great ones from the pretenders.
