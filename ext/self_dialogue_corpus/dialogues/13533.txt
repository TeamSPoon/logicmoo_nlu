What did you think of Kilo Ren in the Force Awakens?
I thought he was a little weak.
What do you mean?  He stopped a blaster full on out.
I just didn't appreciate the temper tantrums in an otherwise good movie.
You're right about that.  Vader would never have had a tantrum.
Exactly, he may be powerful but needs to grow up.
You are right about the blaster scene though.  That was amazing.
He also seemed to know something about Rey, he was pretty upset when he found out who she was.
Maybe they're cousins.
Seems a little obvious but that would make sense.
