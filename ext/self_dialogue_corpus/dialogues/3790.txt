Have you ever seen Children of the Corn?
Most of them, yes. Why?
I saw something that reminded me of it and was debating whether to make a reference you might not get.
Oh I love those movies! The original, and the one with the college students are my 2 favourites.
Did they do a good job adapting them from the books do you think?
I thought yes, absolutely. I love the short story, but it didn't last nearly long enough for me so I was glad to have a movie that would drag it out.
It does seem like it could be incredibly short, doesn't it?
Yeah, but all the waiting and slower scenes only help it I think. Instead of gimmicks like jump scares and using music to pretend something scary's about to happen, it builds up suspense.
Yeah, I see what you mean. It's like what doesn't happen is just important as what does.
Exactly. And I feel like in those quieter scenes you get to absorb the landscape, the wardrobe, the props and everything that you may have envisioned while reading the book, and it lends itself well to the overall feeling of the story.
