Who is your least favorite character in the Harry Potter series?
I really don't like Peter Pettigrew. He betrayed the Potters and ultimately helped Voldemort come back to power.
Yeah, and then he was so close to Harry throughout most of his time at Hogwarts but Harry didn't even know.
Wait, what do you mean he was close to Harry?
Peter Pettigrew was Ron's rat, Scabbers! He was an Animagus.
Oh, you're right! Now I remember. Whenever they would look at the Maurader's Map, they'd see Ron sleeping next to someone named Wormtail and be confused.
Who do you think your favorite character is?
I love both of the Weasley twins. I can't handle at the end of the last movie when Fred dies.
I know. I thought that was one of the saddest parts of the entire series.
So many people died at the Battle of Hogwarts. There's one shot of Colin Creevy, that little boy who always had a camera, and that always makes me sad.
