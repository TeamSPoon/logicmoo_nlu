Did you see the Game 7 between Pittsburgh and Washington?
Yeah. Pittsburgh eliminates them again.
Last year it was Game 6, this year it goes seven games
Same result. Pittsburgh must have their number.
I am surprised the Pens won. Crosby took a beating in the series.
Yeah. Especially in Game 6.
Washington has too much talent not to win a Stanley Cup.
It just seems they can't win at crunch time.
I am afraid Ovechkin will go down as the best to never win a Cup.
He still has some years left. The Capitals are perrenial playoff favorites every year.
Making the playoffs is one thing. Winning it all is another.
The first step is making the playoffs. They are going to have to build off of that.
Who will the Penguins be playing in the Eastern Conference Finals?
The Ottawa Senators. It starts Saturday night.
Who did the Senators beat to make it to the conference finals?
The New York Rangers. They beat them in six games.
Pittsburgh has a huge task ahead of them to repeat as Stanley Cup Champions
Yes they do. Eric Karlsson and the Senators are no pushovers for sure.
When was the last time that there was a repeat Stanley Cup champion?
The last time it happened was with the Detroit Red Wings in the 1997-1998 season.
