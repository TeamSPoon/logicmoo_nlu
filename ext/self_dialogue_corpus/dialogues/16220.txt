What do you think explains the popularity of Hip Hop music?
It has become incredibly popular, hasn't it?
Yes, it appears to be the most popular genre with today's youth.
I think that's because it's real.
What do you mean?
Many Hip Hop producers come from an impoverished background.
How does that make their music "real"?
That have made that music based on actual experiences in their lives. Also, it was a coping mechanism.
What do you mean by coping mechanism?
I mean that music, for them, is a form of therapy. It allowed them to better deal with their surroundings.
Wow, that's heavy. Do you know of other genres with a similar past?
Yes, Reggae also arose in very challenging circumstances.
Do you think that's why Bob Marley sounds so genuine?
I do. Bob saw the suffering an dpain of his people. His gift was the ability to convey that pain in music.
That's really interesting. What other genre is like that?
I'm not sure. Perhaps the history of Jazz reflects a similar process.
What do you mean?
Jazz arose during tense times. It was especially tense between different ethnic groups.
You think Jazz was a coping mechanism to deal with that stress?
It might of been. Music is also a bridge. It's a way to bring all different kinds of people together.
