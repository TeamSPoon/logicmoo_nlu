Have you every listened to Alkaline Trio?
I love Donner Party!
That was one song though, what about an album?
I think the self titled is my favorite.
I loved Goddammit!
Yeah that was a standout album
They still tour it every once in awhile
They do a tour where they play 2 records a night, right?
Yes! I have attended every show in my city.
Thats some dedication
Well they changed my life.
I love the lyrics on From Here to Infirmary
Yes that was strong and Good Mourning was as well.
I think that they really knew how to connect with their fans.
Yeah they write some good tunes as well.
I wish they still made music
They definitely do.
Yeah but is it any good.
Its not like they used to but thats ok
I loved their aggressive edge which it seems like they lost
