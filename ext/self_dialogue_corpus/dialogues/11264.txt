Where did you get those shades?
Well I actually just found them at a gas station but they fit my face so well.
I know they go perfectly with your cheek bones. Plus the shades aren't too dark.
Wow so how did you get those to match?
Well I found two fabrics with the same style and made it into this skirt.
Wow did you do the pleading yourself?
Hes your would be surprised how difficult it is. I had to look in so many fashion magazines to get an idea.
Well that is intense, how did you come across the fabric?
Well it was at a fashion school
Was it used or were you able to find it for free? I thought there was no free in fashion
well that is true and not true. The black doesn't really match the grey.
Does the pattern match the solid?
Well it may but you will need to find some matching shoes and accessories
I was think of wearing this watch, I know it makes a statement but what do you think?
It's sort of beautiful but has too big of a face for my taste
What about these shoes, will they go with the rest of the outfit?
They may but I am not sure, why don't you try it on?
Okay it just I don't think it fits. I will need to get it himmed
Well can we go to a seamstress?
I don't know one in this area but we could always call the fashion police. LOL
