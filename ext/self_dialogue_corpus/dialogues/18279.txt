Do you have any music with a special meaning for you?
Sure! Don't you?
Yeah, but I'm an old softy. I am surprised to hear you also feel so moved.
Absolutely! You want an example?
That would be awesome!
OK. Let me think...
This is great! What do you got?
OK. Here is spooky one.
Spooky? Don't tell me this is a story about the song, "The Monster Mash"!
No, but I do have one. But that;s a different story.
Ok. So what"s the spooky story?
Have you ever heard the Steve Green song, "Enter In" ?
Yeah. Sure.
You remember the part where he sings about passing through death's gate?
Yeah. But that was not about entering death...It is more about surrendering to God and finding peace.
Yeah, but what if you were walking through a cemetery while listening to the song? "Die and enter in" kind of sends chills down your back!
I can see that.
I used to walk to college while listening to a walkman playing Steve Green's "Enter In", and I had to walk through a historic old cemetery on my way, since it was the fastest route.
Ok. So that is creepy!
So now every time I pass by a cemetery, it causes me to sing "Enter In"...but the funniest thing is that it makes me feel all peaceful
