What do you think of Lady Gaga's most recent music.
I think the new album is great!
Me too! What's your favorite?
I like Perfect Illusion. You?
I'd rather hear Million Reasons.
I see. Still, her old stuff is better.
I disagree.
What's so great about the new stuff?
It has a lot more dept. The old stuff was fluffy.
No way! Love Game is an all-time classic!
