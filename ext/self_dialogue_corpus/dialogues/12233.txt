You know what would make an awesome final side movie?  An Obi Wan story.
Yes!  That would be perfect.
I'd like to see him in between Revenge of the Sith and A New Hope.
Me too.  Helping the Rebellion and maybe fighting some of Vader's minions.
Even an encounter with the bad man himself.
That would be cool.  Also maybe he's Rey's grandfather.
I've heard that theory, and that would make for some good back story on her.
Yeah it would.  Her past is way too much of a mystery.
Plus Obi Wan was one of the best characters.
And Ewan McGregor played him very well.
