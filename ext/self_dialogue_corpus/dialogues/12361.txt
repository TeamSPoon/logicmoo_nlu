What character did you identify with more, Han or Luke?
Definitely Han
Yeah I feel the same way too
I think he was more of a man's man
And Luke was a pretty boy?
No i just dont think he was relatable
Yeah Han was a better person
I wish he was the star of the movies.
We would say the same thing I am sure
Like reverse our feelings? I agree, Luke was not a character we could fully embrace
