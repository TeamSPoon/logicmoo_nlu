Hello, how are you doing this afternoon?
I am good, me and my daughter are getting ready to watch a movie.
Sounds like fun, what will you guys watch?
Well, she is six and loves animated movies.
I understand, have you guys ever seen the Shrek movies?
Oh yes, many times in fact!
I love Eddie Murphy's character in those films.
Yes, he is hilarious to say the least.
My brother's eight year old loves Trolls.
I heard that one was pretty good.
Yea it has not been out to long.
Know of any other good kid movies?
Matilda is a classic. I used to love that one.
That movie never gets old to me!
Danny DeVito is great in that movie.
The school principal always scared me!
Yea, I am with you on that one!
My daughter may really enjoy that movie come to think of it.
I sure hope that she does!
Thank you for such a great suggestion!
