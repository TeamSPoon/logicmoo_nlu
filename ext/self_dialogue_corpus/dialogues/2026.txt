so who is your favorite QB?
well i tend to go fore the more Payton Manning types.
does that include Eli Manning?
of course it does! that is one talented family.
i was super excited the day that both of them had played in the super bowl.
i know. it is like they were made to play those huge games to win.
maybe they will play against eachother.
if only that will happen.
i wonder who will be in the next superbowl
maybe the new York jets
or possibly the Texans.
you think they will make it?
there is always a time for anything.
sure, if they fix their coaching situation.
now that is a whole other story. who knows how that will go.
it just seems like they keep firing coaches over there.
that and the players keep leaving.
if JJ watt leaves that is it.
if he leaves they have zero strong defense.
let us hope they keep him then.[
