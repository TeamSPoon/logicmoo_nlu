I spent all yesterday night watching old Lady Gaga videos.
Oh yeah?
Yes. I was just feeling really down, and her music always makes me feel really strong.
I can see that. Any songs in particular?
I love Born This Way and Applause.
Applause is my wake-up alarm song.
What a good idea to wake up to something that gets you ready to meet the day!
Exactly. I like how a lot of her songs have the theme of being yourself.
Yeah. She just owns it. She doesn't seem to follow trends.
No. Lady Gaga sets the trends.
