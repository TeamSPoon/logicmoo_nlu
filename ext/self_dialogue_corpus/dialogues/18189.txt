Have you ever heard of Aurora?
The Northern Lights? Yes, I've heard of them.
No, I'm talking about the singer Aurora. She writes and performs some amazing songs.
Oh, yes. I've heard of her.
You have? What's your favorite song?
I think I like "Puppet." It's about a girl who controls guys.
I've heard that one. It has a really haunting backing track to it.
Yes, and the words fit with the tone of it, too. It makes you think if in a relationship.
Yeah, it does. It's a very haunting song.
Do you have a favorite song of hers?
Well, I like a lot of them, to be honest. But I think "I Went too Far" has some amazing singing in it.
Oh, the runs and such.
Yeah, and also a haunting song. But I've got to say, I like the upbeat "Conqueror" best.
Why didn't I think of that one? Yeah, that one is really good.
The music video for that one is really fun, too.
Oh, yeah, with the guy not really there. What does the song mean, though?
It's about a person wanting someone to take care of their problems.
Hm. What do you mean?
The person really needs to take care of her own issues, and stop waiting for that someone to make her life happy and perfect.
These songs of hers are really deep, and we could talk about them all day!
