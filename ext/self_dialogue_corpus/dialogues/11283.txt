Can you believe Paul McCartney turned 75 years old recently?
Who is Paul McCartney?
He was in the Beatles. He was the bass player and singer of popular songs like "Yesterday" and "Michelle".
Oh, I remember those songs! Didn't he also write songs?
Yes, he wrote songs with John Lennon. They're considered one of the greatest music writing pairs of all time.
I remember so many Beatles songs. I've also seen a cover band that was very good playing their music.
They also had movies they made, such as "Help!" and "Hard Day's Night". "Yellow Submarine" was also made into a movie.
I remember those! I loved watching those movies. They seemed to have so much fun together.
They were definitely one of the greatest bands of all time. Their music is timeless.
Yes, they were. It's nice that Paul is still around to play some of the old favorites.
