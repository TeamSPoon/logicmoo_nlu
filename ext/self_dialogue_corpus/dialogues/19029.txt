Does your dog like to listen to music?
Music is on a lot in my house but I never noticed if the dog was listening. Why?
I read a study done by the University of Glasgow that tested the reactions of dogs to different types of music.
Why on earth would they care what kind of music dogs like or hate?
Think about it for a minute. Both of our dogs are kind of hyper.
True, terriers get very excited.
So if there were a type of music you played that would calm your dog down, why not play it?
What if I don't like listening to the same kind of music as the dog?
Think about it for a minute. When you leave the house wouldn't it be great if you left music on and the dog stayed calm?
Sure, he really gets into stuff when I leave even for a minute- getting in the trash, eating the couch. So tell me what to play.
Well the study tested soft rock, Motown, pop, reggae and classical.
How did they test the music on dogs?
Well they played each type of music over a period of time and assessed physiological and behavioral changes in the dogs in this rehoming center.
Don't tell me they were all mellow when they played classical music and went crazy and did bad things when they heard rock music.
No, surprisingly not. Dogs prefer reggae and soft rock!
What did they test on the dogs?
Heart rate, breathing, behavior and researchers said they showed a decrease in stress levels especially when the music was reggae or soft work/
So tell me, have you tested this out on your dog?
Whenever we have to leave her alone we  put the cable station on the reggae or soft rock station. She's been good and has her favorite music.
My guess is that she prefers the reggae station, just like her doggie daddy.
