What is your favorite rock band?
I really do not have a favorite I like them all.
If you had a favorite who would you pick?
I would say Alice in Chains.
I like them, are they still playing?
I would assume so.
They were only formed in 1993.
Yeah that was before I graduated!
The Devil Put Dinosaurs Here, that album was produced in 2013.
I will have to take a listen to it!
