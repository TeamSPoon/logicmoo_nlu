Have you ever seen the movie Split?
Yes I have and it was a great thriller. Really disturbed me.
The Beast was of course the scariest character and he scared me to death.
I know. I was so sad when he killed the poor doctor that had been helping him.
That was really hard to watch. James McAvoy did such a great job in that movie.
I had no idea he had such a wide acting range.
Me neither. I'm so used to seeing him as Professor X so that's the demeanor I'm used to.
I didn't know Split was a Shyamalan movie until after I saw it.
I'm sure it all made sense when you found that out.
It definitely did. Had his classic twist at the end and everything.
