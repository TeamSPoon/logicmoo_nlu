My daughter can't stop watching Mary Poppins.
That's pretty cool for an eight year old to like!
She just loves Mary and her whimsical charms.
I've always preferred Fred myself.
I wonder if they'll do a remake of that movie.
I hope not.  There's really no reason to.
Yeah, but Disney seems to remake everything these days.
I get that, but some things should be left alone.
Well get ready, the remake is coming next year.
Oh no!  Why, Disney, why?
