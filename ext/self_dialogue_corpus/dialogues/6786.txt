Tell me ! Are you team frozen ?
Like the movie ?
Yes the movie , what else ?!
I mean I thought the movie was cute, but so overhyped.
I personally loved it ! The songs were so cute.
I will give you that, they were.
Love is an open door and let it go are my favorites.
I think mine would be do you wanna build a snowman?
That's the best song!
Olaf is too cute !
