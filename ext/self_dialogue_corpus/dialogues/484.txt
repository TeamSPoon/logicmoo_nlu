Who do you think is the greatest receiver in NFL history?
Jerry Rice is on the top of my list.
I agree with you that is a good one.  Anyone else in contention?
What about Lynn Swann?
He was great for the Steelers in the 1970s.
I enjoyed watching the acrobatic catches when I was a kid.
I knew him well because of that.
Anyone else come to mind?
What about Randy Moss?
Randy was great but I guess he is just old enough yet.
What do you think of Terrell Owens?
Terrell Owens was a great receiver but there were always drama issues.
I think the press hounded him too much.
He brought it on himself with all the antics instead of just playing the game.
Still, I think he deserves a place in the Hall of Fame.
He did change the direction of any team he played for.
What about Michael Irvin?
He has got to be up there on the list.
The Dallas teams in the 1990s dominated.
He was a big part of that.
