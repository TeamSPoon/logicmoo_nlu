I just saw Wreck-It Ralph and it has to be my new favorite movie!
I saw it a few years ago when it came out and thought it was just okay.
You only thought it was okay?
Yeah, I just didn't really connect with the characters.
I grew up playing video games, so this movie really hit home with me.
I grew up with video games too, but I thought the plot wasn't that great.
What was wrong with the plot?
I just didn't like the ending I suppose. Also, that one candy girl annoyed me.
Her name was Vanellope!
See, it must not have been that great if I can't even remember the main character's name.
