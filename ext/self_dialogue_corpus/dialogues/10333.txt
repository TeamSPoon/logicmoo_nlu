Have you seen Terminator 2?
Yes I actually saw it with my dad when it came out in theaters.
Wow that was a long time ago. What did you think of it?
I thought it was far better than the first.
Right that's because special effects had evolved a lot since the 80's.
That's true. What's your favorite scene of the movie?
Definitely the motorcycle and truck chase between Arnold Schwarzenegger and the T-1000.
That's my favorite too. Probably one of the greatest chases in history period.
I agree. Edward Furlong did a great job for that being his breakout role.
He really did. It's too bad we haven't seen him in much since then.
