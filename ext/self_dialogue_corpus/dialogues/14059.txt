Whatever happened to Lady Gaga? Haven't heard much about her, except last time when she performed at the Superbowl halftime.
I feel like she fell of the map. It's a shame, she's a really great singer and piano player.
Exactly! The Fame Monster is probably one of my favorite pop albums of all time.
I totally agree it's a good album, but I'm more partial to her debut album, The Fame.
Oh really? What's your favorite song on that album?
Hard to say, but I really love Paparazzi and Poker Face.
Can't go wrong with Poker Face, that's the song that made her blow up.
Yeah, did you ever see her perform the piano version of it? It was so full of emotion and talent.
Of course I have, the thing I love about Lady Gaga is that she's a great artist even without the studio effects.
Amen to that! I hope she goes on tour soon, I'd love to see her live.
