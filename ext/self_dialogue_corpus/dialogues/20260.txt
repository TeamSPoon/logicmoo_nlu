Hey, look at this review in the New York Times! It's for a movie called "The Big Sick."
What's it about?
It looks like it's a romantic comedy, but updated for 2017.
That sounds promising. What does the review say?
The main character is Pakistani-American, so it says there is plenty of cultural nuance and humor.
Who else is in the movie?
The review says Zoe Kazan.
I love her! I loved that movie she did with Daniel Radcliffe.
Me too! Wow, look at this? The actor and his real wife based the story on their own relationship.
Look--another article says his wife was actually in a coma!
And they based the movie on that?
The NPR article says that it helped her deal with what happened while she was in a coma.
I bet that would be healing in a way.
His wife in real life, and in the movie, are white girls. So there must have been some cultural tension there in the family.
I think immigrant parents want their kids to say within their cultural group. But they also have to know it's a new generation.
Yeah. Nanjiana, the actor, says in the interview, that his parents "decided that their love for me was bigger than whatever sense of obligation."
He talks about how his parents are still changing their perspectives--I bet that comes through in the movie too.
I'm really curious to know more about his life before we see the movie!
It sounds a lot like what I've been through with my parents.
I can see that. Let's go to the movies!
