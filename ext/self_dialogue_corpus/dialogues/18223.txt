Let's talk Bruno Mars my friend.
Yes, I would like that actually.
What would you say is his all time great song?
I would have to say, his breakout song 'Just the Way You Are.'
Yes, I think that should be in his best of album.
Right, it's like the best ever. I also really like 'Grenade.'
I literally sobbed when that song came out!
The lyrics, the beat, and everything was so amazing.
Yes, straight to the core for sure.  'When I was Your Man' was also a hit.
Oh yes! It was! I played that on the piano when it first came out.
Really? I didn't know you played!
Yea! I can also play his song, 'The Lazy Song' and 'Marry You.'
Wow, you really are talented.
Haha, not really. What about 'Locked Out of Heaven?'
Oh man, that one had some great Michael Jackson vocals in there.
Right! I'm so glad I'm not the only one who thinks so.
They're always compared with each other actually.
I agree, though no one can steal Michael Jackson's throne.
He is a legend! But Bruno Mars can try.
Haha so true.
