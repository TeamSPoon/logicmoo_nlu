Have you heard of Blue October?
I don't think so, have they been around long?
Yes, they released their first album in 1998 and were playing in local places for years before that.
Maybe I have heard their music or something. Name a couple of songs.
Their fisrt album had a couple of great songs, "Gun Metal Blue" and "His Name is Crazy" are my favorites.
I have never heard of those.
Their second album, Consent to Treatment,  included "Independently Happy", that is a good song.
Still no, is their music on the radio or would I have heard it somewhere else?
I still hear "Calling You" on the radio every once and a while, have you heard that one?
Yes, now I know who you are talking about.
I think they sang "Calling You" on The Tonight Show when Jay Leno was hosting.
No, they sang "Hate Me" then. I remeber watching that episode.
I really like their music, especially the later albums like, Fooiled.
Me too, I really identify with some of the songs on that one.
I went to pne of their concerts a couple of years ago.
I thought they only toured around their home state?
They actually tour all over but, they are from the area I live in so I did see them in their home state.
That's awesome.  I would like to see them live sometime.
I can check and see when they will be around and we could go next time they are here.
That would be great. I would love to see Dallas.
