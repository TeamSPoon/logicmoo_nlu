Was hey Jude an album?
I think it was thrown together on Capital records to fulfill a commitment.
I believe it wasn't a preconceived album. Paul wrote it for John's son Julian who he felt bad before because his parents were divorcing.
Correct,and obviously it was a huge hit,but not an album they planned.
I think Capital just took some singles and put them together on an,album and hey Jude became the title track because of its success.
I think I read the same thing. What a great classic song.
It sure was at that. One of my all time favorites.
John actually loved the song.
He did love it and helped paul get through some lyrics he didn't like.
Those two fed off of each other. They were amazing.
