I remember seeing Guns and Roses live in concert.
When was that?
Back in 1992 I went to a concert in the new stadium.
Axel Rose has a mean temper.
At the concert he got into it with someone in the crowd.
Wow. How was the music?
Their rendition of Paradise City was the best, but the whole show was good.
I wish I could have been there.
Slash can play a mean guitar.
That guy has some serious musical talent.
