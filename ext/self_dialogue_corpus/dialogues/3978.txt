Did you see they're going to make a sequel to The Strangers?
Hm. I wonder if it will be any good.
The first one terrified me
Did you know it's sort of based on true events?
I did. They filmed it near my house so it extra freaked me out.
I don't like that they keep making sequels of movies though.
I know i wish they would just make new stuff
Have you heard of any non sequel movies?
I think there is one called God Particle
i'll have to watch it.
