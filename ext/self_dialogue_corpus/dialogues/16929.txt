My favorite film composer is Hans Zimmer. I know that Williams is more popular, but he is my favorite.
Doesn't ring a bell, what did he do?
Well, he is most known for the Lion King Soundtrack, but he has composed such a variety of pieces.
Ok, I thought that was Elton John
John did the songs, but Zimmer composed the music like the "Naaa sa venya!"
Ok, I like that score, what else is he known for?
TONS of music! He did Gladiator, Inception, The Dark Knight, you name it!
Ok! I know who you're talking about. He is really good, I liked Gladiator and that Inception Music
He is known for those, but he does all sorts of work with his group Media Ventures, you'll here his guys doing all kinds of music.
Like Pirates of the Carribean?
His buddy Klaus Badeldt did the first one, but the sequels are all Zimmer. His group scored Iron Man, Game of Thones, and everything Ridley Scott has done
Ok, I'm gonna have to look him up.
My favorite scores by him are actually his less known pieces.
I see he did Driving Miss Daisy, I don't remember the music from that movie at all though...
If you hear it, you'll recognize it.
Also Rain Man and Black Hawk Down, those were good movies.
He's changed his style over time, those earlier ones were scores where he used a lot of theme, but later he went more minimalist.
Minimalist?
Yes, where the themes are reduced to simple progressions like The Joker Theme in the Dark Knight.
Like Phillip Glass?
