I want you to hear an artist I know you'd like. The group's name is Esthero.
Never heard of them. What kind of music?
It's Soul mixed with Trip-Hop. It's a really excellent album.
Oh great. I'm down to listen. Where are they from?
The female lead and songwriter is from Canada. I think the producer is from the States.
So there's only the two of them? What's the name of the album?
"Breath From Another" is the masterpiece. It's a bit old.
How old? It doesn't matter. Good music stands the test of time.
It was April of 1998. Yes, it's almost twenty years old.
Let's get started. What song is your favorite?
I'd say "Superheroes" is my favorite. There are close seconds though.
It's very lush sounding. She has a remarkable voice.
Doesn't she? She is amazingly smooth.
I'm very impressed. You were right. You know my musical tastes.
I do, don't I? Incredible production too. He's a great producer.
What's his name? I'd absolutely like to look up his discography.
He goes by Doc. I know he produced another artist Res. She had an amazing album with him too.
Thank you for the awesome find. What should I listen to next?
Doc has also worked with The Weekend. Listen to the next track "Swallow Me". It's my next favorite.
What a title. Sounds futuristic. I'm definitely going to have to buy this.
