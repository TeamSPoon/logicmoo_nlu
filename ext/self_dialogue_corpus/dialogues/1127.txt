Do you think the dolphins winning ten games was a fluke?
What do you mean.
Well,outside of New England,the east is weak.
True,they play every one twice in their division.
That's a great point.
I guess their schedule is a lot tougher this year outside of their division.
Yea,they get the falcons too,besides two with the patriots.
That's going to be tough.
Could go 0-3.
That's very possible.
They play the saints and raiders too.
I think both of them will be improved.
The raiders were very good until the injuries.
Losing Carr was a killer.
Anyone who loses their starting qb is in trouble usually.
They also play the chiefs.
The chiefs will be a tough one too.
Andy Reid does a good job.
He's a good overall head coach.
Yes he is.
