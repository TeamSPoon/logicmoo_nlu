Have you ever seen The Mist?
Yes, I think that I saw it about four years ago.
Wasn't it written by Stephen King?
Yes, and I think that it was directed by Frank Darabont as well.
What did you think about it?
I liked it. I thought that it was more interesting than most movies out today.
Did you read the book?
Yes, the book came out a long time ago. I read the book so many times I almost memorized it!
Was the movie faithful to the book?tt
For the most part, it did. There were a few changes.
Like what?
A lot of little changes, but the biggest one was the ending.
How did it end in the book?
It was kind of an open ending, King himself called it "hitchcockian." You wer left to come up with your own conclusion.
Wow, that is a lot different than that gut punch of an ending that was in the movie!
Oh, I agree, but Stephen King said that he liked the movies ending.
Really? I'm surprised!
Actually, he said he wished his book was as good as the movie! Why did you bring it up though?
They're coming up with a TV show based on the movie!
Awesome! Would you like to watch the movie again to get ready for watching the show?
