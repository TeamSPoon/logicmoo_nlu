What do you think is better, Pixar or Warner Brothers Animation?
That's easy man. Pixar is Disney and Disney makes all classics.
Can't we say the same about Warner Bros. animation?
They've made a number of good movies, sure. However, Disney/Pixar has Toy Story, Inside Out, Finding Nemo, Finding Dory, Monsters, Inc., the Incredibles, WALL-E, and so many other classics.
Yeah, I guess you're right. You just named a bunch of great movies and didn't even mention Cars, or A Bug's Life, or Up.
See? Disney Pixar has so many great movies.
Do you know who was associated with Disney Pixar?
Specifically? No.
Steve Jobs of Apple fame.
Really? I had no clue!
