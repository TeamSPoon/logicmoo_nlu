What are you up to today?
Oh, I'm just listening to some electronic music.
Yeah? You usually do.
I like to a lot, it's good background music.
How come you want background music?
Electronic music to me just fits nicely into whatever I'm doing because it doesn't distract me.
That makes sense.
Yeah it's very good productive music.
How so?
Well you can focus more on what you're doing but still not have to listen to silence.
Oh that I can understand.
Do you ever listen to music like that?
Not really, I prefer stuff with singers.
There are a good amount of electronic bands with singers, well at least with words in them.
What does that mean?
A lot of groups will edit in recordings of people or voices.
Oh, right. I remember, like club music.
Kind of, I don't really go to clubs so I wouldn't know.
Club music is like electronic, but has some words here and there and heavy beats.
As long as it's musical, I'll probably like that kind of electronic music.
