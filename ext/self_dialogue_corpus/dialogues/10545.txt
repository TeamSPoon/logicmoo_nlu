Hey, how are you?
Good thanks, how about you?
Great! I finally just saw the movie La La Land.
That's the musical one right?
Yes! It was great. Like a throwback to the days where many movies were musicals.
I've heard it was really good. How was the music in it?
The music was great. City of Stars is a beautiful song and I really like We Can Start a Fire.
I think I've heard City of Stars. Isn't there a famous artist that sings too?
Yes, John Legend. He's the main voice on We Can Start a Fire.
Awesome. I wasn't so sure about it because of the lead actors.
You mean Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone.
Yes. They aren't singers so I didn't know how that would be in the movie.
They actually aren't bad at all. They sign surprisingly well.
That's good to hear. Maybe I'll try to see it then.
I'd definitely recommend it. The music is very jazzy but I think even if you aren't a fan of jazz you can enjoy it.
I actually do like jazz so many it would suit me pretty well.
If you like jazz then you really need to see it. Ryan's character is a jazz musician and a lot of the movie centers around that.
Oh, I didn't know that. I guess I didn't really know what it was about.
It's both a love story, kind of, and the journey of the jazz musician finding his way back to performing.
Well I will see if I can get it on demand or rent it from Red Box. Sounds like I'd really like it.
