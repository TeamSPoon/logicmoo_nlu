So have you seen "Finding Nemo"?
No I haven't. Is it any good?
Are you kidding me?! It was AMAZING! One of the cutest movies I have ever seen.
Oh yeah?
Seriously. I know it isn't you thing per say, but the turtles in that movie you would love! There is a scene where they meet the turtles, hey are surfers and he calls him "Mr.Turtle" and the turtle responds "My dad was Mr.Turtle, you can call me Crunch" it was hilarious!
So they have surfing turtles?
Yes and the little one is great! Oh and Dori, the fish with no memory.
Don't all fishes have no memory?
I guess? But seriously you have to see it, I really can't do it justice.
I'll check it out some time.
