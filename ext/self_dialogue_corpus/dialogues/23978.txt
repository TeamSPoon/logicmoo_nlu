I've been thinking about Robin Williams movies since I found out there is going to be a remake of Jumanji.
He had a great variety of movies he starred in.
I loved his character in Mrs. Doubtfire.
He was hilarious, but I couldn't believe his kids didn't know it was their dad.
One of my favorite movies he was in was Hook.
Hook? You mean like Captain Hook?
Yes. He played the part of a grown up Peter Pan.
Was this in Neverland?
It was and the movie had all the characters from the original Peter Pan movie.
I thought he did an outstanding job of acting in Dead Poet's Society.
That movie won an Academy Award for Best Film.
Williams was nominated for Best Actor for that movie, but didn't win.
I thought he was a fun character in the Night at the Museum series.
I really enjoyed those movies.
I don't know how real to life his portrayal of Teddy Roosevelt was, but I like how he played the character.
He was a lot of fun in the remake of Flubber.
That's one I haven't seen.
I think I will remember him best as the voice to Aladdin.
In the Disney movies?
That's correct.
