Have you heard of Kenny Chesney?
Yes,  I use to listen to him in high school.
He was one of my favorites.
Has he had any new songs.
Not recently or at least not that I have heard.
I will have to check out his website and see what he has been doing.
Let me know. I would love to see him on tour.
Me too.  We could go together.
He use to have really big hits.
Brad Paisley and him were my favorites.
I like them both too.
They should do a tour together.
I think Kenny Chesney was married but got divorced.
I don't remember that.
I liked his song you and me.
I forgot about that song.  I liked it too.
I used to have that cd.
Do you still have it?
I will look and if I do l will bring it to your house.
We could have a kenny chesney sing along.
