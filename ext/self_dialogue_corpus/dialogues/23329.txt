Did you ever watch Inglorious Basterds?
Was that the Tarantino flick?
Yes it was.
No I missed it.
You need to watch it.
It was that good?
Haha what do you mean by saying that good?
Well you are mentioning it for a reason.
Yes you understand me.
Yes I do.
The movie is spectacular.
How is that so?
It is perhaps more appealing to men because of the violence.
Ok I understand that.
There is great action too.
Ok I like that.
There is good awkward yet serious dramatic moments.
Ok Tarantino knows what he is doing.
Yes I like his films.
I do too.
