Would you rather watch a silly comedy or a romantic comedy?
It really depends on my mood. I most like silly comedies.
So maybe something like Happy Gilmore or the Waterboy?
Pretty much anything with Adam Sandler or Will Farrell works for me!
I'm much more into romantic comedies, but sometimes I like the classic goofier ones.
Have any examples?
Anything done by Mel Brooks, like Spaceballs!
That movie is so funny! Rick Moranis as a Darth Vader clone is genius.
I know, they couldn't have done that movie any better.
They should really do a sequel.
