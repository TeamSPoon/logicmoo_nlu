Do you remember "Wreck it Ralph"?
Yes, why?
Well they are making a sequel of it.
Oh that's great, I loved the first one.
Me too.  John C. Reilly is hilarious in it.
I know, I can almost see him when he speaks.
And the animation is so great!
And it makes me remember all the video games I played as a kid.
I know, like Pac Man and Frogger.
Such a good movie.
