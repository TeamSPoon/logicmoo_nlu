Hey, you ready for some football?
Oh yeah. Counting down the weeks until I can see my team in action.
What team is that?
The Colts who have made it to the superbowl twice.
Ha ha, and how long ago was that?
Ok brace yourself, 1971 and 2007.
Wow, that is like a decade ago.
You're not lying, but anything can happen with some new players.
Your right. I see they drafted a few safetys and cornerback.
Hopefully the can bring some talent to the team and end with a great Season.
Hey do you remember what year Peyton manning stopped playing with the Colts?
I believe it was in 2011.
Ok, then he went and played with Denver Broncos, right?
Yeah, in 2012 he went and played for the Broncos.
I know he retired sometime after that.
That retirement occurred sometime in 2016.
Ok, so basically Peyton spent 14 seasons with the Colts and then ended his career with the Broncos.
Right. And don't forget He won his last Superbowl the same year he retired.
I remember now, he didn't say he was going to disney. He was going to drink beer.
Ha Ha, he said "I’m going to take a lot of beer tonight.”
