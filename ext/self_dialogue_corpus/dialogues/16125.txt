Do you like Alternatie music?
Definitely.
What artist?
I like listening to Santigold.
I love Santigold. Have you heard her new album?
The 99 cents album? Yes.
I love the song Banshee.
That song is great because it keeps you moving.
What about "Can't get enough of myself"?
That song is very funny.
I find it incredibly catchy.
I agree.
I can't wait until she has another album.
Hopefully she will have another at some point soon.
Did you like her last album before that one.
It was okay but I only liked two songs from it.
Same, it was not as good as this current one.
She has such a unique style.
That is why I like her.
Anyways it was great talking to you!
