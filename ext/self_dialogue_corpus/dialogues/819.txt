Do you think Jerry Rice was the best.
Maybe
Why not.
I think he was good for that style of offense
He wouldn't have been in another type
He might have been but was perfect for that one
So if not him. Then who?
Good question
Well answer it
Randy Moss
Thats not bad
He's not bad
Always brought problems with him though
He did but you couldn't look past the talent
He had talent
Just look at what he did on the patriots
That was insane
look who the QB was
Brady
Enough said
