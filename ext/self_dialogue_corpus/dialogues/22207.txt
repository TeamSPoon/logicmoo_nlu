Do you want to go to the movies this weekend?
Not really. Movies at the theatre are so expensive.
Ya I know, but some really great movies just came out
I know, but I really can't afford it right now.
OK. What about watching a movie on demand? It's cheaper
Deepends. What movie do you have in mind.
John Wick 2 is out On Demand. Keanu Reeves dude!
Ya that's suppose to be good, but I don't know.
Well we can scroll through all the movies and pick one we both like.
True. Yeah that sounds good.
What day Saturday or Sunday the new movies come out Friday so we could find somethig really good.
I Could do a movie on Sunday. We could make a day of it maybe watch 2 movies.
Yeah I think they have a special if you buy 2 you get the second one cheaper.
Really. OK Cool movie day Sunday!
Definately John Wick 2 is #1 on the list
OK The 1st one was great. What is the new one about? I haven't seen anything about it really.
Oh it looks good. He reluctantly accepts a job, you know he was an assasin, in order to repay a favor from an old mob employeer he ows a favor to.
Oh man that sounds good.
Yeah he has to kill a woman! Top of a Italian mob syndicate.
Oh man yeah deffinately. We can pick another movie after we watch that one. See ya Sunday.
