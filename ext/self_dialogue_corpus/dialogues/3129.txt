Hey Lenny, did you get the birthday present I sent?
I did, I love it man!
I thought you would, did the jersey fit?
It fits perfectly, how did you know I was Dolphins fan?
My mom old me you loved Marino back in the day.
I really did man, I didn't know they still had his jersey.
They are hard to find, but he is a legend so it is possible.
We should watch some of his old games one day.
I would love that a lot, one of the best to ever do it.
A shame he never won the Superbowl to be honest.
That must have been upsetting to you as a big fan.
It is definitely one of the biggest what if situations I think about.
I have a few favorites that never made the Superbowl.
Like who?
McNair was a guy I liked, mostly quarterbacks.
It really makes you appreciate guys who can make it each year carrying the team on their back.
Are you trying to credit Tom Brady?
Maybe a little bit.
Fair enough but the Patriots are the old school Warriors team now.
I can see the correlation.
