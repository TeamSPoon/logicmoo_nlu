Someone told me you're a big Beatles fan, is that true?
Oh man i'm a HUGE fan; i have all their CDs; i'm talking albums and singles; live stuff and studio recordings.
Well i have most of their stuff but it sounds like you've got me beat, no pun intended.
Ha! that's a good one.  beat.  anyway, i even have a very rare, valuable copy of "rubber soul," autographed by george harrison which came with a letter of authenticity about when and where he signed it.
Wow! that's one of my favorite albums.
Me too.  actually i have 3 copies of that album; the autographed one which i have never listened to, an old vinyl copy and a CD.
i don't blame you for not listening to the autographed one; it might get accidentally damaged.
i'll tell you something only my wife has known up to now...i actually bought insurance on that album, in case it was stolen or damaged.
I don't blame you at all; i would have done the same thing.  who was, or is, your favorite beatle?
I always liked Lennon best, and Harrison was a close second.
Ah, the two beatles who have passed on.  i still haven't gotten over lennon's tragic death?
I'll never get over it.  hard to believe it was 37 years ago.
Has it really been that long?
Yes, it was late 1980, we'll never know how many more great songs he might have written.
how true.  what was your favorite John Lennon song?
Probably "Mind Games," but of course i love "Imagine" as well.
Imagine is my favorite Lennon song and maybe my favorite beatle song by any of them.  were you a fan from their early days?
practically from the day they came over here in 1964.
did you know at one point they had every song in the top five? all five! imagine that; oh i'm sorry there i go with my puns again...IMAGINE that.
oh that is funny; i didn't even catch that one until you pointed it out.  great talking to you about the best band ever!
