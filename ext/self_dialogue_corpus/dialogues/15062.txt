Have you ever seen Hear No Evil, See No Evil?
No, but I think I've heard of it. What's it about.
It stars Gene WIlder and Richard Pyror, as a deaf man and a blind man respectiviely. They get involved in a murder case and are the prime suspects.
Okay, now I get the name, who else is in it?
Well, Kevin Spacey plays a porfessional killer and one of the real murderer's, along with actress Joan Severance.
This sounds interesting, could I get more detail on the plot?
Well, the murder is off Richard Pyror's character's bookie, who was smuggling a valuble rare gold coin for the killer's and tried to keep it for himself.
Okay, this makes a bit more sense to me as why the guys are accused of the murder.
Yeah, it was hilraious seeing them have to cooperate to escape custody and elude the killers, as RIchard can do things due to his hearing that Gene can't and vice versa.
This sounds like it could be a funny movie, I'll have to look for it.
