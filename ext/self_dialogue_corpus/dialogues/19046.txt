Do you play any musical instruments?
Yes,  I play the guitar and some piano.
Oh that's great,  how long have you been playing the guitar?
I started playing about 10 years ago.
I've been thinking of learning to play,  did you take lessons somewhere?
No,  I taught myself how to play.
That's excellent,  what resources did you use to help?
I looked at a few different Youtube tutorials to learn the basics.
Any specific tutorials that you would recommend?
The beginner lessons by guitarlessons.com is a good place to start.
Thanks for the recommendation.  How frequently did you have to practice?
When I first started I tried to practice everyday.  I couldn't practice long at first because it hurt my fingers.
Oh,  why did it hurt?
Well the pressure of the strings on my finger tips was painful,  but over time I built callouses that protected my fingers so I could play longer.
Wow,  I didn't realize that happen.
Yeah,  that's why it is very important to practice regularly to give your fingers a chance to adjust.
Are there any other tips you would give someone who is just starting out with the guitar.
Make sure you learn the basics correctly,  so you don't develop bad habits
Why is that important?
It makes it harder to learn more difficult chords if you aren't doing the basics well.
