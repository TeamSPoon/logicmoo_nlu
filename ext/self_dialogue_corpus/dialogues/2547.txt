Who do you have winning the Super Bowl this year?
It's still too early to tell. Obviously the Pats are favorites to win it all.
I put money down on the Bengals. Vegas is giving them 66-to-1 odds to win it.
No way do the Bengals win the Super Bowl this year.
Sure, it's a long shot, but I like they're team.
Who did they get in the draft?
they got John Ross out of Washington with the 9th pick.
Oh he's really dynamic. Fastest guy in the draft I heard.
He'll open thinks up for that offense. With AJ Green and Tyler Eiffert on the other ends Dalton should be able to throw at will.
They do have a really good receiving corps and Dalton has proven to be a good QB and leader.
Plus their running game is among the best in the league
But their defense isn't strong enough, and defense is what wins championships.
I think you need a good defense nowadays but an elite QB if you want to win it all.
And Dalton isn't elite.
He's been borderline elite for a season or two. He's capable of putting up an elite season this year.
I can name 10 other quarterbacks I'd rather have over Andy Dalton.
The point of the bet was that Dalton could potentially have an elite season, and if he does the Bengals win it all
I would have rather put my money on a safer pick like the Packers or Steelers
But if the Bengals win, I look like a genius and I win a lot of money.
I think they've made improvements and should be better, but nobody from the AFC is beating the Patriots to get to the Super Bowl.
