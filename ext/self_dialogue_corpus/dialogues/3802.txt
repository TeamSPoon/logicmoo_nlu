Do you like Keanu Reeves?
Yes of course, who doesn't?
Did you see one of movies from the 90's, the Game?
I don't think so.
It is also starring Michael Douglas.
Oh I think I have heard about it.
It is truly thrilling.
What is it about?
There is a lawyer, going back and forth from the big town and small town, it is a great story.
Ok thank you for the recommendation.
