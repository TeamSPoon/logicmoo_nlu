What song are you completely embarrassed to love?
My god, I have so many. You first.
No, you first.
Fine. "Livin' la Vida Loca" by Ricky Martin.
HAHAHAHAHAHAHA.
Yeah, yeah, you said guilty pleasure, so you can't laugh at it.
Why do you like it?
I mean, it's ironic that it's a gay man talking about a crazy woman he's in love with, but the music is great and upbeat and fun to listen to.
I can't stand his valley girl accent of sorts. I hate how his cadence.
Yeah I can understand that. So, yours?
Ready for it? It's bad.
I'm totally excited.
"Spice up your life" by the Spice Girls.
See? I'm not laughing, it's respectful.
Thanks!
Hilarious, though. That song is awful
You lied!
Come on, The Spice Girls are super generic and nothing happens in their music.
It's fun to listen to.
It is, but the lyrics are a bit distracting. They don't match the harmonies.
