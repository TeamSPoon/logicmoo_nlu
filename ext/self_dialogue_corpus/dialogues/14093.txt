What do you think is the most overrated Lady Gaga song?
Honestly, probably Million Reasons.
Really? I thought it was nice that that song was a little more sophisticated than her older music.
Eh, I would rather listen to Monster or Bad Romance.
That's funny because those are the songs I find most overrated.
Are you serious? Those songs are classic.
I don't think they give her much credit. Lady Gaga is much more talented than those songs.
You've got to be out of your mind. I love near the end of the Bad Romance when you can hear all the emotion in Lady Gaga's voice.
Yeah, but Million Reasons actually has more meaning behind it.
I guess we'll just have to agree to disagree.
