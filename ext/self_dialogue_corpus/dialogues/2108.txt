What is your favorite football weather?
I love watching NFL games when it's snowing.
Why snow?
It makes everything more exciting.
How is snow exciting?
It makes it more difficult. So the professionals make more mistakes.
That makes sense. I didn't think about that.
What about you? What is your favorite?
My favorite time to watch an NFL game is in the rain. It also makes it more exciting.
Both rain and snow can make the field and ball slippery.
I think regular weather football is exciting, but there is just something about football in the rain.
Or in the snow.
Yeah! Or the snow.
I hope we get to see some exciting weather games this season.
Yeah, me too. I want at least three of them
If we get lucky there might be at least one.
I guess one special game is better than zero.
Who do you think is the best team in the rain?
That's an interesting question.
Well?
