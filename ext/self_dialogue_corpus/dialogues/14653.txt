I'm so ready for next year's college season.
Why do you say that?
I believe any number of teams can win the title.
Who do you think will win next year?
The Kentucky Wildcats have the best freshmen class coming in, so they have a great shot.
I agree a little, I guess. I just hate the one and done guys.
i don't like it either- I wish they would make a rule requiring players that go to college stay at least 2 years.
That would be great, but don't think it will happen.
Coach Cal gets the blame for this, but many coaches want these same players.
Even Coach K from Duke recruits the same players.
But, because he is Duke's coach, he doesn't get scrutinized like Coach Cal.
I just get tired of 40-50 freshmen declaring for the draft every year.
Yeah, I love UK, but would like to see these kids play for more than one year.
It takes me a month to get to know the players every year.
I miss the old days when you could watch them grow over 3-4 years.
Unless the rules change, you won't ever see that again.
Can you imagine LeBron playing 3-4 years of college and how much fun that wold have been?
He would have set multiple records in college.
No doubt.
Guess we will have to setttle for watching him win another NBA title thsi year.
