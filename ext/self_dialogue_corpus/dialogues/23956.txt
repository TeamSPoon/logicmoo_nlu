Did you ever go see Moana when it came out in theatres?
I didn't but I saw it on Netflix just the other night.
What did you think?
It was so cute! I thought for sure that the piggy would be her mascot throughout the whole movie, but she got stuck with a derpy chicken.
Haha! That chicken was brilliant.
I like that they made her body look different than all of the other Disney princesses, too.
I noticed that! Not all women look like an hourglass, and they did a great job with her appearance.
I thought the grandmother was really a nice touch, too.
She reminds me of Grandmother Willow from Pocahontas, somehow.
She does! There's always a parent who orders the princess around, and then someone who gives good advice.
Yeah, like Sebastian from the Little Mermaid, Mrs. Potts from Beauty and the Beast...
Exactly. but one of my favorite elements of all movies is the interactions that people have between each other.
What do you mean by that?
I enjoy seeing the way people support each other. Like family and friends do in reality.
Yeah, I can see that. I prefer there to be a good plot, too.
Yes! Like a quest.
Quests are the ultimate plot, haha.
Remember Quest for Camelot?
I do! It was basically Beauty and Beast but not Disney, and in Camelot instead of a "little town" in France.
You can't beat a medieval setting when it comes to children's movies.
