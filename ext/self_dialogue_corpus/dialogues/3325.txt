Do you like zombie movies?
Sort of I guess?
Why only sort of?  I love them!
They all are pretty cliche.
Oh, I get what you mean.  Is there anyone you actually like?
I guess Resident Evil movies are okay.
What do you like the best about those?
I guess I like that they are faster than regular zombies.
See, they aren't all cliche!
Yeah, I guess.  I still don't like them though.
