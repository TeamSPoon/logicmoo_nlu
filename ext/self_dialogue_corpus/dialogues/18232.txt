What does John Lennon's music make you think?
It makes me think of being in love
Does it make you feel good?
Oh yes. I love it.
He is such a great singer
That is an understatement
Yeah.
He has one of the most unique voices ever
He does. I can always recognize his voice
Did you like him better in The Beatles?
No, I prefer his solo stuff
Me too
I'm not even sure he liked The Beatles
They all have their dramas
But, it would be cool to see them all perform together
That is true
What is your favorite song from Lennon?
I like Jealous Guy the most
That is my favorite too
Good choice
