Did you see that they put Lilo and Stitch on Netflix?
No way!
Yes! I just watched it last night for the first time in 15 years.
Is the movie really that old?
Yes, can you believe it?
No I can't. I will have to watch it again soon.
You have to, it brought back so many good memories. I used to love that movie.
I did too. I loved Lilo, I thought she was awesome.
She is awesome! Stitch is pretty funny, too.
He sure is. I will let you know what I thought about it once I am done.
