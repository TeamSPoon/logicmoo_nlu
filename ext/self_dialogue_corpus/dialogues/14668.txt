did you see the warriors/spurs game yesterday?
yeah, I can't believe Golden State came back
The Kawhi Leonard injury killed San Antonio
They can't compete without him
Yeah, there's no way they can win this series if he can't go
They'll be lucky to win a single game
Even without him though, there's no way they should have lost that game
Yeah, it was one of the largest blown leads in playoff history
Golden State is too good to simply give games away like that
Game 2 is probably a must win now
Yeah it's hard to see anyone beating Golden State four times in five games
Agreed. But San Antonio can never be counted out
Still, if Leonard can come back, the Spurs can definitely hang with Golden State
maybe, but it's hard to see Golden State playing as poorly as they did for the first two and a half quarters
It's pretty clear the Spurs can't really guard Golden State
The Warriors were getting just about any shot they wanted over the last quarter and a half
Still, Leonard is the key
Yeah, he can create his own shot and at least give San Antonio a chance on defense
It was amazing how out of sorts Golden State looked in the first half
It'll be interesting to see how much of that was San Antonio's defense and how much was Golden State simply playing poorly
