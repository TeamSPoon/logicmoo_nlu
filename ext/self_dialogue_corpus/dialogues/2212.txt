Do you think Teddy Bridgewater will be back for the Vikings this year?
No I thinkl they will do the smart thing and keep him out for another year
So do you think Bradford can lead them into the playoffs
He started out well last year but the rest of the league caught up with the Vikings pretty quickly.
Yeah, and they don't have Peterson anymore
I think Peterson was overrated and they relied on him too much.  He was a great player but he never really led the team
I agree.  It reminded me a lot of Randy Moss from the old days.  He seemed more important than he was.
Besides it is time to get some new looks to the offense and the defense.
What do you think of Zimmer as a whole
I think he is the best coach they have had for a while, but since that is the case he is also overrated because he looks good in comparison to what they have had
I don't agree, I think Zimmer has some good ideas and can inspire the team.
This is the Vikings we are talking about you know, one of the most snakebit teams in the NFL.
Yeah, but it could be worse, we could be Buffalo Bills fans
Anyway, thedy have to get their receiving corps to be more relevant.  Treadway has to step up and Floyd needs to at least perform.
The young defensive players have to start shaping up this year as we lost some really good veterans.
Well, camp starts in a couple of weeks so it won't be much longer before we see what is happening
Are you planning on attending this year?
Not this year, too much to do at work, I will follow the Twitter feeds and the KFAN reports
I think I will head down there for one of the weekends.
Sounds like fun!  Let me know how it went and what you saw.  See you later!
