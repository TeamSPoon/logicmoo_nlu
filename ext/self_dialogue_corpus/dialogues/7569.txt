Where did all the food come from at the banquets?
I think it was just magic.
No, wait, I remember.  House elves cook it?
No they don't.  I remember Dumbledore just waving his wand and it appearing.
No, no, see, the elves made it, Dumbledore just made it visible.
That doesn't make any sense.  The elves could just bring it up.
But maybe it was easier to just use magic to bring it up vs. the elves doing it physically.
They're house elves, they're used to hard work.
One thing's for sure, I would eat a ton at one of those.
Me too!
