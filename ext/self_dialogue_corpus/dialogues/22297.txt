Seen anything good lately.
Not really. The kids control my movie selections these days.
Ha! Kiddy films for you?
Yup. If I see Trolls one more time, I might freak out!
That wasn't such a bad flick.
Yeah, but 100 times is pushing it.
You know what animation I'd like to see?
Which one?
Lego Batman.
Yeah! The first Lego Movie was so good.
Yeah, I thought it was all stop animation.
Nope. Mostly CGI.
But they did such a great job, you couldn't really tell.
I'll be Lego Batman will be just as good.
And it will be a welcomed relief from Trolls!
I wonder when it comes out.
Well, it's not in theatre anymore.
Yeah, I'll bet it'll be soon.
You aught to bring the family over when it does.
Yeah, that'd be fun!
