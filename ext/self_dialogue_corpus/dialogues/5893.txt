My kids were watching Cinderella a few days ago, and now I've got the songs stuck in my head.
Oh, yeah? Which ones?
The one sung by the mice when they're making her dress. "Cinderelly, Cinderelly, night and day it's Cinderelly."
Oh, that's a cute song.
And the song by the fairy godmother, "Bibbidy-Bobbidy-Boo!"
That one would probably get on my nerves if it was stuck in my head.
Exactly. At least it's not the off-key song by the evil stepsister.
Well, now that you mention it, that song will probably be stuck in my head!
Oops, sorry about that!
It's fine. I'll just think about Moana songs instead to get rid of it.
