Have you seen the latest Disney Animation movie?
Which one? The Beauty and the beast?
No, that one isn't animated. I meat Moana
Which one is that?
The one with the girl who loves the water?
OH right, Moana. Great singing! Who was that?
Auli'i Cravalho, she's amazing and what a great song.
I wonder means Moana, is it just a random name?
Moana means Ocean in Hawaiian.
Who was the voice actor that voiced the big guy?
His name is Maui and was voiced by Dwayne Johnson
That was a great choice for the role.
Yeah, they didn't audition for Maui's role, they were sure they wanted Dwayne Johnson's voice.
I heard it had great special effects.
Yeah 80% of the movie has special effects, pretty impressive if you compare it to big hero with only 46%
That's impressive, the characters and place looked very real.
Yes, the team who developed tried to be historically and regionally accurate and make Moana a strong girl.
And that cute little pig, right?
lol Pua!!!  Was voiced by real pigs
I'll have to watch Moana again after all this facts.
