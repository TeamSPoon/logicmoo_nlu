What's the best Star Wars movie?
It's "The Empire Strikes Back," of course.
It's not the original, A New Hope?
A New Hope is a good movie, but Empire Strikes Back is better.
What makes it better?
The Empire Strikes Back adds all the classic Star Wars features. It's the one that tells you what the Force is, introduces Yoda, and so on.
What about Return of the Jedi?
The Ewoks are too annoying in that movie.
And what about The Force Awakens?
While it was a good movie, it took too much of its plot direct from A New Hope. It felt derivative.
