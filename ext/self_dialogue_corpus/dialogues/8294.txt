Have you ever heard of a group called The Monkees?
I haven't. Are they a new group?
Actually they were really popular in the 1960s.
That's way before my time.
It is, but you probably know of one of their songs.
Which song is that?
I'm a Believer.
The song from the Shrek movie?
There was a version of it in Shrek, but The Monkees did the original version.
I had no idea the version in the movie was a remake.
