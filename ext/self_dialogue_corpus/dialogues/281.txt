Have you watched Avengers 2 yet?
Of course, I watched it in the theatres!
Who is your favorite character?
I love Loki, he's such a great villain.
Yea Loki is really cool, and powerful.
Well, he is basically a god after all.
Yea, but the hulk still beat him up pretty bad.
Nah, he just caught him by surprise.
No way, the Hulk is the strongest.
The Hulk isn't so great.
