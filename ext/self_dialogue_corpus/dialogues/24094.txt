What do you think would be the top as far as romance movies goes.
There are the almost cheesy but cute ones, like those by Nicholas sparks.
He made the Notebook right?
He wrote it.
What else did he do?
he did one called the Longest Ride.
What was that about?
It was sort of a western, but not really, boy bulls and romance.
I am not big on the whole cowboy romance.
He did a few others too. Like the choice.
I did not know that was one of his.
I think it was underrated, it was a bit darker.
I remember the girl from that movie was in Foot Loose.
The remake, not the one with Kevin Bacon.
What other ones are like that, the cheesy love ones.
There is one called Dear John.
With Amanda Seyfred?
Yep, I thought that one was very romantic and well written.
I loved that I thought it would not end happy.
But at the very end it all did.
