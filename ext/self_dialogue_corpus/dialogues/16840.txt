Billy Joel is probably one of the best musicians of our lifetime.
I totally agree. There are very few songs he had that I don't like.
My favorite is Scenes From an Italian Restaurant.
That is a fantastic song and it was amazing it got played on the radio because it is so long.
I love how it incorporates different styles of music.
The different scenes let him do that.
I am singing it in my head right now. Brenda and Eddie were still going steady....
Too bad they got divorced.
Well it was just a matter of course.
Yes I guess they had to return the carpets they got from Sears.
Piano Man is a classic though.
His piano playing is unbelievable.
I always get amazed at how he was able to write his own music and sing it as well.
Yes, not many are that talented.
If kids nowadays would listen to his music they would realize what they listen to is garbage.
Yep, Billy Joel is a true artistic genius.
I love that not only did he use pianos in his music, but also used a multitude of instruments like wind.
Yes I love the sound of trumpets in many of his songs.
I am glad that he is writing again.
Yes, so am I. Looking forward to a new album from him.
