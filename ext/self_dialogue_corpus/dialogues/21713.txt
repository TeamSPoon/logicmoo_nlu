Have you seen the new Pirates of the Caribbean movie yet?
You mean, Dead Men Tell No Tales?
Yeah, that one.
I have! My friends and I went to see it last weekend. It was amazing. How about you?
I watched it last night with my cousins. It was exciting. This Pirates of the Caribbean movie is by far my new favorite.
I would have to say it's mine as well. I love how Johnny Depp never loses his touch with Jack Sparrow.
So true! It's as if they started filming this new movie as soon as they finishing filming on the last one.
I never realized how much I missed watching all the old characters until Dead Men Tell No Tales came out.
Yeah, the cast was amazing. I can never get enough of Barbossa, old Gibbs and that monkey named Jack.
There is also the newcomer who plays Henry Turner. I was so surprised, at first I had no idea that he was Will and Elizabeth's son.
It was surprising wasn't it? All in all, I really think Disney is doing a good job with the Pirate movies. Did you know it cost Disney 320 Million to make this movie?
I read something about that, Disney initially set the budget for 250 million but a few problems happened on set which racked it up.
That's quite an amount. But I'm sure the movie itself will pull that budget back in and more.
I agree. Hey, did you know that this is the shortest Pirates of the Caribbean movie, being only 2 hours and 9 minutes long
2 hours is pretty long for any movie, I never realized the other ones were so long as well. But then, i never pay attention to things like that.
Usually if a movie is under an hour and a half I really won't bother watching it.
Movies that are so short seemed rushed.
Yeah, I agree with you. Do you think Disney will have plans for another Pirates of the Caribbean production?
I have no idea, but it would be amazing if they ever announced one. I can never get enough of Johnny Depp as Jack Sparrow.
Don't forget Barbossa, Jack the Monkey and the rest of the crews!
