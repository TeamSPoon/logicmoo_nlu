Who is the first traded player this year?
It seems to start earlier but I really have no clue.
The trade deadline has been quiet lately.
I think more teams are filling voids in from the inside
To avoid losing their farm?
The competition level hasnt been to the point where you need to make a splash
So we could see a team just promote from within
I think thats the direction they are going in
Thats interesting
It kills the Yankees philosophy
Well they abandoned that when Steinbrenner died.
DO you think he would sit through an era like this?
No he had no patience for it thats why they havent been good for so long
Did the Orioles window of opportunity close?
It will if they cant resign Machado
What makes you think they wont
The writing is on the wall with him
That they dont like him?
No that the coach is losing the team.
I dont see that at all
