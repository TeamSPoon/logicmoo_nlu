What is your favorite movie of all time?
I think it is Casablanca.
That's a really old movie.  Why Casablanca?
Well, it has everything, mystery, suspense, romance, just a great picture.
I've never watched it. Who's in it?
It stars Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman.
What's it about?
Basically, it's about a French resistance leader trying to get out of neutral Morocco  and to America, but he needs to obtain papers to get out.  the papers can be purchased for a price.
You must be a big Bogie fan.
I like most of his movies, but this is his best.
Is Bogart a good guy or a bad guy?
Bogie starts out as a seeming cold, cynical and uncaring man, but in the end he sacrifices his interest to help the woman he once loved.
Sounds more like a romantic movie.
Like I said, there is a lot of romance, but also mystery and suspense, killings, blackmail, things like that.
I've heard of it.  Did it win any awards?
It won Academy Awards for Best Picture and Best Director, I know for sure.
When was it made, in the 50's?
It was made in the early 1940's.
Is it a long movie?
It's about average, a little over an hour and a half.
