Do you like Disney movies?
I love them.
What is your favorite one?
I like Cinderella the best.  How about you?
My favorite one is tangled.
Oh that is a good movie.  I love her magical hair!
Her hair is amazing!  Too bad her mother is so mean.
Well it's not really her mother.  Can you imagine being locked up in a tower like that?
No, but at least the movie has a happy ending.
Well that's true, but then it is a Disney movie!
