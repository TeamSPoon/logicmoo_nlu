Do you happen to like music history?
As much as the next person why?
What's your take on the Mods and Rockers conflict back in the sixties?
I'm interested in that part of history, sure.
So would you be pro-Mods or pro-Rockers?
I have to say I'm more drawn to the Mods.
What attracts you to them?
I pretty much am attracted to their musical tastes and preferences.
And what about the way they dressed?
I admire that too, Kinda clean.
So the Rockers' music didn't appeal to you?
It seemed a little rough and rugged to me.
Well the Rockers were a tough bunch.
Their music reflects that. To be clear, some of that music I like, like Eddie Cochrane.
And what Mod music do you like?
The Who and the Yardbirds.
The Who are unbelievably awesome, no doubt about that.
I love music from that period.
They don't do music like that anymore.
I think only if they're doing a remix or cover.
