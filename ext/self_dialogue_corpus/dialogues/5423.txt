Walt Disney had so many feature animated movies , which do you like best?
Well I don't think walt himself worked on my favorite one.
Well the Disney company then, which one do you pick?
Tarzan. I loved Rosie O'Donnell as Terk.
She was really perfect for this role. Her voice was so spunky and cute.
I really find the strength of Tarzan was the acceptance by the mother.
That is a heartwarming theme. I think the music is also one big strength of the film.
"You'll Be in My Heart,"makes me cry almost everytime I hear it,
Phil Collins is a great musician. I think all his songs in this film are superb.
Phil is a legend. he performed the songs and was also the narrator on the film.
