Which is your favorite Rocky movie?
There are six of them, right?
No!  Seven, actually.  Rocky one through five, Rocky Balboa, and Creed.
Oh wow, you are right.  Seven, hmm...
Well I will tell you my favorite first.  I like Rocky.  The first and original.
Well yea, that's a classic.  A really classic underdog story.
Yes, interestingly it's a movie that I appreciate more with age.
I agree.  The story of overcoming life's challenges and defining your own success is a message that resonates more as you get older.
Exactly!  So anyways, come on.  What is your favorite Rocky movie?
Well I want to be different from you, so I will go with Creed.
Ok, the newest one.  Why Creed?
Well honestly it's borderline not even a real Rocky movie, since it focuses more on Apollo's son.
True.  But Rocky is featured prominently, and it follows the overall storyline.
Agreed.  It did have a slightly different feel than the other Rocky movies though.
You are right.  So what did you like about Creed?
Well the acting of course.  Michael B. Jordan was amazing, and Stallone probably had his best acting performance ever.
Yes.  It's interesting catching up with a character you first saw in his 30s, and now he's probably 70 years old.
Exactly, it is interesting, and Stallone does a heck of a job.
They are thinking of doing a sequel to Creed.
I would be interested in seeing it.  And it would be the eighth Rocky movie!
