Have you heard of the band 'The Toadies'?
No, never heard of them.
I'm not surprised. You'd probably have to be around my age to have heard of them.
Why is that?
They were an Alternative Rock band who was briefly popular when I was a teenager. They didn't have a lot of staying power.
Ah, I see. Were you a fan?
Yeah, I liked their album 'Possum Kingdom' a lot!
They seem to have an animal theme. Toads and Possums!
Haha, they were kind of a weird band.
What do you mean by weird?
The lyrics of their songs tended to be kind of strange. Not the typical stuff you will hear from a lot of bands.
What's an example?
Well, one of their popular songs was called 'I Come from the Water'. And that's what it was about, how the singer or character comes from the water.
What do you mean, 'come from the water'?
It was never specified in the song. That's what I mean, they were weird.
Yeah, that sounds weird, I agree. But you liked them anyway.
I liked them because they were weird, not in spite of it. Their lyrics were kind of dark and sometimes funny.
Do you think I'd enjoy them?
I'm not sure. The sound is kind of dated, very much like grunge-y 90s music.
Hmm, I might stay away then. It's not really my thing.
