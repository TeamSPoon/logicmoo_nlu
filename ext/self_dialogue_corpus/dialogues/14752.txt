Have you seen the second zoolander movie
I did not know their was a second
Yeah a couple years ago it came out
Wonder why they brought it back
I am not sure to be honest
Was it bad
Bad is an understatement
Shame ben stiller is one of the better comedians
Yeah they kinda tarnished it
Well maybe  i should see for myself
