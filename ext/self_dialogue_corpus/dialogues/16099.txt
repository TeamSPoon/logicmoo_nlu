What kind of music are you into?
I usually listen to classic rock.
Oh, I like that.  What are your favorite bands?
I don't know.  I like the Eagles, Queen, a lot of stuff.
Oh, I like Queen too.
Yeah, I actually didn't really get into them until the last few years.
That's pretty crazy.
Yeah, they've been gone for a good while.
Yeah, but I think they still tour.
Yeah, they do tour.  They just get different frontmen.
Yeah, that's pretty much it.
What's your favorite song by them?
I know it's cliche, but you can't beat Bohemian Rhapsody.
Yeah, that song is pretty awesome.
Everyone knows it, but it never gets old.
It's pretty awesome when even kids know songs from thirty years ago.
Is the song that old?
It's close to it.  It was really popular in the 80s.
Oh, yeah it was in that movie.
Yeah, Wayne's World.
