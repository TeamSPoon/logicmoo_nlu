Hey man, I can't wait for football season to start this year.
What a season the Patriots had last year!
Yeah, how do you top coming from the biggest deficit ever and winning a super bowl?
Well, you could win back to back super bowls!
Yeah, that is a good point!  Imagine that?
They have put themself in a really good position again this year it appears.
I know they have the best wide receiving corps I have ever seen on an NFL roster.
Yeah Amendola, Edelman, Hogan, Mitchell, Cooks, and a healthy Gronk!
That is a scary matchup for any defense!
They also brought on a pro-bowl caliber cornerback, and still have one on the roster from last year.
Right, I hope they find a way to keep Malcolm Mitchell long term.
Me too, I love him as a player.
He makes that big play when you need it.
Yeah, and in the biggest games like the superbowl.
That is the kind of player you just have to pay!
I hope your right, I would hate to see him leave.
Well, at least we have him this year at the least!
Yeah, its going to be a great season.
Yeah, as long they can stay healthy!
Amen to that brother!
