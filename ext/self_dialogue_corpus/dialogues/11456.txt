What do you think of the Beatles?
They're not my favorite band, or my favorite type of genre, but music today wouldn't be the same without them.
Agreed completely - there wouldn't even be the same types of music if they weren't around.
What's your favorite song?
I think Hey Jude or Yesterday, which are the classics, but really any of their top songs are great. What about you?
I think Eleanor Rigby might be my favorite.
That is a classic. Have you seen Paul McCartney or any of them in concert since they stopped the Beatles?
No, it would be a classic one to go to, but I have not.
I think that's one of my all time dreams would be to go back in time and be able to see the beatles live.
I agree completely.
