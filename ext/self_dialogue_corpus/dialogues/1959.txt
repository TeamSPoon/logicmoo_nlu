You think Kaepernick will find a team?
No. He's getting blackballed.
You think?
I do. I mean look at all the other teams with bad quarterbacks.
Sure but some are rookies or have a lot of sunk cost.
You don't think Kaep can be a backup?
Maybe.
Who's backup in New York?
Uhh...
Geno Smith. Is Kaep better than Geno Smith?
I'd say so, yeah.
And he'd be a great backup to Wilson in Seattle.
They signed McCown, right?
Who is terrible, and doesn't have the same game as Kaep.
Which is similar to Wilson's.
Right. And Kaep's jersey sold like crazy last year.
So I guess he wouldn't be a financial liability.
Right. People will buy his jersey no matter what.
Like Tebow.
Kaep is waaaay better than Tebow.
