Okay, what is your favorite genre of action movies?
I'd have to say crime thrillers, particularly shoot'em ups.
ALirhgt give me some expamples of what you mean.
Well, Scarface for one.
Okay, that's a decent example, bit more drama than action, but only just. How about another?
The Punisher movie, that's defintiely a shoot'em up.
Okay, but which one? The 2004 one or the 1989 version.
Both, and the sequel to 2004, Punisher: Warzone.
Actually, that's supposed to be more of a reboot than a sequel.
Who cares?
Got me there, so what's another good shoot'em movie?
Well, Shoot'em from 2007 definitely fits the bill.
Yeah, kind of literally. Any other movies you can think of?
Smokin Aces and Smokin Aces 2: Assassin's Ball, for example.
Okay, another two for the genre, but what about the Untouchables?
Decent amount of shooting, but more of a plain old gangster film.
You might be right there, can you think of any more shoot'em ups?
Well, the Young Guns can fit the bill, but personally the sequel stank?
Yeah, it was kind of unnessecary and poorly thought out.
It was at that, wasn't it?
