Sharon,I have been watching the fashion shows and you would not believe what the models have been wearing on their feet.
What could it be other than heels, Lexa?
Yes but I have seen them in breathable boots in monochromatic colors at Salvatore Ferragamo.
So you think monochromatic colored boots are a hot fashion trend to follow.
No, but Erdemâ€™s snakeskin combination with ankle lacing and gorgeous platform heels certainly would make a statement if I ever wore them
Platform heels? Out of the question.
You can dress up the plainest of outfits and dresses with a good pair of platform heels.
Not with the ones I have seen. Those things are not for me.
How do you feel about the flat versions of the platform heels?
Flat version? I have not heard about them.
The flat version are a platform and flats combined.
So, it's a flat shoe on a platform. Is that what you are telling me?
Yes.
Flat shoes are not good for your feet.  I don't wear flat shoes.
But they were so cute. There was one that was red and white.
You can be cute all the way to the podiatrist if you want.
You don't have to wear them all of the time.
And you don't have to wear them at all.
There's just no winning with you on these shoes is there?
Nope.
