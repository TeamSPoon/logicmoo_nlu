Do yo like Cedric Thorton?
Yea he is a great defensive tackle.
The Cowboys do have a good team.
Do you know they signed him to a four year contract?
No I did not.
Do you know how much he gets paid????
No I dont know, how much?
17 million dollars!!
Holy Cow, that sure is a lot of money just to play football.
Yea some of those players get paid so much!
Yea and for doing something they love to do.
Can't be a very hard job.
I dont know about that..
Cedric only had 22 tackles in 13 games last season.
Not too great.
I think they are expecting more from him this season.
Well it is his second season so maybe he will do a bit better.
I hope so.
Well if he doesnt he won't be renewed after his contract is up.
Yes, that is true.
