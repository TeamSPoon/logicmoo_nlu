Have you heard of The Mamas and The Papas?
I think I have heard a few of their songs....is that the group that sings Monday Monday?
Yes, they are one of my favorite musical groups from the sixties.
What is your favorite song by them?
California Dreamin, it has such an eerie feel to it, but I love it.
Whatever happened to them?
Well, they had some controversy amongst the group, love triangles and affairs supposedly, and they broke up.
That's too bad.
Yes, and unfortunately Mama Cass (Cass Elliot) died in the 70's, so a reunion was never possible.
Why does it feel like a lot of the really talented musicians from that era died too soon?
I know! One of my other favorites, Buddy Holly, is another one who was gone too soon.
What happened to him? Drugs?
No, he was killed in a plane crash.
Wow, tragic. I assumed drugs because there were so many who died from drug related complications.
Like Jimi Hendrix?
Yes, and Janis Joplin.
What are some of your other favorite oldies groups?
I like the Beach Boys, their music makes me happy...it's usually pretty upbeat.
My dad loved the Beach Boys, they were around for quite awhile.
Yes, Surfin USA is a classic, let's go to the beach!
