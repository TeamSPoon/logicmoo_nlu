Do you like Lindsey Stirling's music?
Sound a bit familiar, what kind of stuff does she do?
Sort of electronica, but with classic music interwoven.
Oh, I think I might have heard her stuff at a rave one time. Like, violin combined with heavy beat?
That sounds like her, yes. She has classical music training, and I think that makes her music much more interesting.
Agreed. Is she anything like Bjork?
Hmm, other than being female and immensely talented, I don't think I would compare them too heavily. I do like Bjork also though.
Yeah, Bjork is amazing. Her musical style is insanely diverse.
And her voice is divine. Vespertine was an amazing album, so dark and moody.
Yes, and the soundtrack she did for that movie she was in was fantastic.
You mean Dancer in the Dark?
Yes, that one! One of my favorite movies, and the music was a perfect match for it.
Agreed. Well, speaking of amazing women who do weird music, do you like Laurie Anderson?
Yes! She's actually one of my favorites of all time. I remember hearing Big Science as a kid, it really blew my mind.
I can see how that could blow a child's mind. Especially O Superman.
The political message in that song is still so relevant to our times.
Sadly true. I like her political perspective on things, and the way she plays with gender roles.
Ha, I see what you mean. Those voice filters she uses are crazy.
Speaking of political songs, Anderson's Only An Expert was pretty fabulous.
Yeah, and such a catchy tune!
