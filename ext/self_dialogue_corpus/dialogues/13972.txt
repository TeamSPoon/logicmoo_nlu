Hey you like Lady Gaga?
Nah not really
WHY NOT?
Because her songs are so boring, like Bad Romance is just another pop song.
What about Born this way?
What about it
Doesn't it make you feel like strutting down a walkway like a dork?
...Kinda
So you do like Lady Gaga then
YES I DO but don't tell my wife.
