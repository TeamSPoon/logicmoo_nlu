What did you think of the Ghostbusters remake?
I thought it was pretty funny as a standalone movie. It can't compare to the original though.
Yeah, nothing can ever beat the original.
Exactly, the original was the perfect movie. I often wonder how they came up with such a hilariously perfect script like that.
Me too, I always wondered, did some of those funny parts happen by accident? Or were they really geniuses who thought of it?
Probably a combination of both. However the new movie didn't contain any of that kind of brilliance, even if it was enjoyable.
Do you like the whole idea of remaking films with all-female cast members?
I think that's very interesting, I do like to see a new take on my favorite movies.
I loved Kristen Wiig and Melissa McCarthy in Bridemaids. That's one of the funniest newer movies ever made.
I love that movie too! Although Melissa McCarthy is in everything these days, it's kind of annoying.
Really? I think she's hysterical!
She is, but you get sick of seeing the same person in every single film.
Sort of like Dwayne Johnson. He has to be in every movie, even the franchises.
Not to mention Mark Wahlberg, Samuel L. Jackson, etc.
Yeah totally, take a break already guys!
Back to the new Ghostbuster movies, I wish Slimer could talk
Yeah like in The Real Ghostbusters, I loved his voice in that, it was so cute.
I agree! They should bring that back.
Maybe there will be a sequel and he'll talk.
I hope so!
