Do you ever watch bad movies on purpose?
Like to hate watch them or to have fun making fun of them?
To just soak in the absurd bad stuff people make, for fun.
Oh totally, I did that with the Wicker Man remake several times.
That's a great example of a great, bad movie.
Yup, The Wicker Man remake is the best unintentional comedy.
Did any of the people involved with The Wicker Man remake every comment on its cult status?
Not that I know of, it's so enjoyable to watch though, and I hope they're proud of that even if it wasn't their intention.
I can quote that remake more often than some comedy movies.
Always possible to slip a "Not the bees!" quote into every conversation.
Nicolas Cage movies in general have taken a turn for the unintentionally funny lately.
Yeah he hams it up big time in a lot of his recent films, in a bad way, but for me it's a good thing.
Indeed, I can watch Nicolas Cage overact a role for days, it's so enjoyable.
Though honestly I wouldn't mind seeing him return to his Leaving Las Vegas level of esteem.
Me too, when he wants to be he is a fantastic actor with serious chops.
He's also a great action star, well maybe not anymore, but back in the day.
Yeah Con Air and The Rock are great films.
Same can be said about Face-Off, he was just so fun to watch.
Maybe one day we'll get a great swan song from Nicolas Cage.
The world can only hope it doesn't involve bees.
