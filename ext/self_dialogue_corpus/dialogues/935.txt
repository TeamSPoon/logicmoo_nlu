So are you going to go to Latrobe to watch training camp?
I am, and I am excited.
What is going good for the Steelers this year?
Well, Martavis Bryant is back for one thing.
Man, that's great, I'm glad he got reinstated.
Yeah, some of the rules in the NFL are pretty arbitrary and outdated.
Seems like they would work more with the guys that have problems instead of ostracizing them.
I agree, but that's over for him. He is back in the black and gold and I think he is going to have a breakout year.
That would be fantastic. Who else is back?
Cam Heyward for one, he's recovered from that chest tear and will be back to take over leadership on defense.
I heard one of the Steelers say this week that your best ability is availability. So true isn't it?
I could not agree more. Staying healthy is completely the name of the game.
Do you think Ben will stay healthy this year?
Oh my goodness, I certainly hope so. I'm planning on watching him take this team to the super bowl.
So you are telling me there is a chance.
Definitely.  Martavis Bryant, Antonio Brown, Leveon Bell, Ben, all of those guys are top of the heap competitors.
Really just one team to beat then.
Don't even mention their name.
O.K. I definitely will not say the name of the team that has Tom Brady as its quarterback and that is the team the Steelers must be able to beat.
Good.  I don't want to hear it.  And anyways, this is the year that the Steelers D learns how to shut them down. Hard.
