Have you been to see the movie Sing?
No but I love the music they play in the commercials.
my husband and I took our granddaughter to see it and all three of us loved it.
Your husband went too?
I was surprised but he will so almost anything his granddaughter wants him to do.
So tell me about it.
Well as you said the music was great. There was enough variety that I new some of the song and Beth(granddaughter) knew some.
I think that it is great that they are sung by  stars that sang them.
I am not sure that Beth got the real reason that the singing contest was started for but she really just enjoyed the animals and singing.
Animal? Oh yeah there are various animals in it.
Oh some of them were so cute and perfect for the parts they played.
Your husband liked this?
Actually he liked it enough that he went out and bought the movie so we could watch it again.
Really?
Some of the humor was for kids but some of it was for adults. He enjoyed the music he loves the song Hallelujah .
Ok but I heard that really there seems to be no real plot .
Maybe so but you can't complain about a movie that can keep old folks and young kids all happy at the same time.
That's the truth.
Well if you are looking for something to do with your grandson was weekend you may want to consider going to see Sing.
You know what I will ask him if he wants to go. It would be something for the two of us to do together.
