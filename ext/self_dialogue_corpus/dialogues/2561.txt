What kind of sports do you watch on TV?
Oh, all kinds. My favorite to watch is football.
Yeah, it's exciting. Do you catch all the games?
If possible. The one I never miss, if I can help it, is Monday Night Football.
Monday Night Football? I used to watch that a lot. Not so much any more.
How come you stopped?
Oh, no real reason. Just usually busy on Monday nights.
Yeah, I am too sometimes. But I always try to catch it, if I can.
I liked it when it was on ABC. It's not the same on ESPN, for some reason.
I agree. It's best early in the season, too. Those are the most exciting games.
Really? What's the difference?
Well, when it's early in the season, the records are brand new, you know. And the teams are usually showing off their new player additions.
Oh, yeah. That makes sense.
Also, at that point, you just don't know which teams are the strongest, who's gonna bounce back from a difficult start...that kind of thing.
Miami is my favorite team. I think they were the number one appearing team on MNF.
They were, definitely. The San Francisco 49ers come in second. I think they played something like 50 games.
Wow. What are the most often-seen match-ups, do you know?
Let me think ... Broncos vs. Raiders happened like 20 times. Same with Cowboys against Redskins.
That makes for some heavy rivalry.
Sure does. Some exciting games, for sure.
