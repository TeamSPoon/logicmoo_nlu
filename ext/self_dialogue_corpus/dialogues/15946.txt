What is your most favorite kind of music?
I really tend to like anything that puts me at peace.
What do you mean?
Have you ever seen the movie Ben Hur? Then new one?
I think so. It was a pretty long but good movie.
There's a song called "The Only Way Out" on there by Andra Day.
Oh really? I'll have to go back and check it out in the movie or look it up on YouTube.
It is such a soulful song and really just kind of puts me in a relaxed mood.
That sounds pretty great!
I like lots of different kinds of music but that one song is a favorite of mine at the moment.
What do you tend to listen to on the radio?
I usually surf around until I find a good song.
I do that sometimes too.
I think I prefer the stations thought that play a mix of today's music and older music.
Yes! So you get a good taste of everything there is.
Right! I like a few songs from today but really like older music too.
You mean like older rock music?
Sometimes, I also like older R&B music from the 90's.
Oh okay! I'm more of an alternative music girl myself.
You should see my music playlist, I have everything on it.
