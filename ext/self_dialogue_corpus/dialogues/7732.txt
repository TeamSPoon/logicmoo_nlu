I just saw Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets
The second one in the series?
Yes, directed by Chris Columbus.
Isn't Richard Harris in that?
Yes, as Dumbledore.
But he's gone now, right?
Yes, he died shortly before release of the fim.
Too bad.
John Cleese is still there, though.
A great comedian.
