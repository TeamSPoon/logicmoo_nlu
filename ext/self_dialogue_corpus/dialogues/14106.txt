Have you heard Gaga's latest album?
Yes, I think!  Unless she's released something recently.
No, I think this album came out last year.
Then yes, I have heard it.  It's very good.
Yeah, I like it.  I just wish she'd go back to the first two albums' sounds.
Yeah, while it's noble that she likes to sing about causes, they aren't really fun to dance to in the club.
You aren't in the club for inspirational messages?
Haha!  No!  Not really.
I totally understand this.
You can't beat Just Dance.  It's one of my all-time favs.
