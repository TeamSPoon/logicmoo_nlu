So what did you think of Alice Cooper?
He was a wild one, wasn't he?
Yes he did some raunchy stuff.
But he was a good singer.
What was your favorite song?
School's Out for Summer. That one is still popular.
Mine was Eighteen.  He did some crazy concerts.
Yes he was a toss between punk and metal.
Yeah that sounds about right.
I think he is from Detroit.
