he only time he looked ok is when we were running uptempo.
But the very next game when he was told to run Bill O'Brien's offense, he was not good at all.
I do give him credit for not turning the ball over.
Here is stats since being a pro.
Its nothing eye popping and nothing to write home to momma about.
Let me tell you, this signing is a Mike Devlin special as Giacomini played under him when he was with New York Jets.
Could he work out?
We're about to find out.
However, according to Pro Football Focus, Giacomini is a below-average pass blocker like Clark, allowing four sacks and 44.3 grade off 266 snaps on the field in 2016 (which included just five starts).
PFF also notes that in 2015, Giacomini's last season as a full starter, allowed 54 quarterback pressures compared to 67 in 2016 for Clark.
Overall, Giacomini seems to be more closer than an average pass blocker rather than Clark who is well below-average.
Not to mention that he has been riddled with back injuries through last season.
304-pound 31-year-old became available because the Jets cut him after last season.
i surely hope the Rookie pick up the playbook quick. Because this dude is just as bad as Clark. No thanks.
Foreman is terrible in pass protection.
he is not taking the starting job from L. Miller.
He will take snaps from Blue.
that's a possibility as well since Blue knows this offense better.
According to the Chron's Aaron Wilson, the Houston Texans have signed veteran tackle Breno Giacomini to a deal.
Could he be the answer at right tackle?
