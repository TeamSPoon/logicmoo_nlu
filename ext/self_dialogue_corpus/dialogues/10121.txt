Who's your favorite James Bond?
Sean Connery, without a doubt!
Mine too, but Roger Moore was pretty good.
I think he did more Bond films than the rest of them put together.
Who's next in line?
Well Craig has been doing it...
He's gotta be about ready to give it up.
I thought I read that he was done after Spectre.
They'll probable offer him a ton of money.
I'll bet!
