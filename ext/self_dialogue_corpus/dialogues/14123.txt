Lady Gaga has such a beautiful voice.
I agree. She sounded amazing when she sang the National Anthem at the Super Bowl.
Yeah she sounded great, but her outfit was crazy.
You have to admit it was a little more toned down than some of her other looks.
True. Her style when she released The Fame is so different from her style now.
Even her music is different now. Her newest album Joanne is much more alternative sounding.
I love that album. My favorite song from it is Million Reasons.
I like that song too, but my all time favorite song by her is probably Bad Romance.
Yeah, that was one of her biggest hits.
Monster and Poker Face were really popular songs too.
