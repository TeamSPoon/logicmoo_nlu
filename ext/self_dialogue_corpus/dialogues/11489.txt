What is your favorite unknown Beatles song?
Unknown huh? I guess I can't go with Hey Jude?
Unfortunately not!
Okay - I really like "Polythene Pam" then
I've never heard of it - what can you tell me?
It's on their Abbey Road album
Great album, why do you like it so much?
It's full of cultural references to Liverpool. To me it shows that even at their peak they still stayed true to their roots
Oh, that's pretty funny
Yeah - at the end John Lennon even fakes a Liverpool accent
