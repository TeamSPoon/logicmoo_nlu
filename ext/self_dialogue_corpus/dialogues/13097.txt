How did you like Rogue One?
I hated it.
Really? What about the last scene?
That would be an exception. That was amazing.
That's the only scene you liked?
No. Some of it was pretty good but one thing kept bugging me.
What's that?
Well aren't there supposed to be a bunch of Bothans?
Oh yeah I forgot about that.
Yeah that's why I didn't like it.
