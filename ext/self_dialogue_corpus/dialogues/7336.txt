Wreck it Ralph s my son's favorite movie
my kids also like that movie, the mouse is kind of gross though
I know, if I saw a mouse I would try to trap it
so would I! But it was funny how he rode around in the car
that hotel was so nasty, it was infested with mice
I would not have wanted to stay there
remember they did not have a choice because their car broke down ?
That is right, I think it was also raining pretty hard
I bet that hotel smelled really old and like mold
it probably did, I hope they did not have to stay for long, the poor boy was so bored he had to play with a mouse!
