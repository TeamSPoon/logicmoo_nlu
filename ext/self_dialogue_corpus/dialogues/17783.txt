do you know hopsin
yeah, he did the ill minds
do you have a favorite ill mind
i like the one where he was talking about god
he was so religious for a while too
but then he started doubting again
it makes sense.
yeah, its hard if you never see him
i like the first ill minds
the ones with no story?
yeah, he was just dissing other rappers
thats how he got famous i think
he dissed wayne and tyler
nobody responded to him though
they probably just didnt know him
or they didnt wanna help him get more famous by dissing them
that could be true too
it brought his name up
i think tyler responded
but tyler doesnt diss
