Who is your favorite NFL team?
I love the cowboys. What about you?
I am a Dolphins fan all the way
Dolphins play in a tough division.
Oh yeah its hard to win the division with the Patroits there
Yeah the Patroits amaze me every year
How about them Boys? Do you think Prescot has another breakout year?
I think if Elliot and run the way he did last year he will
They were a great combo last year. I could see them running the table again this year
Yeah I think they brought some life back to the cowboys fans
Yeah I was hoping they could go all the way after my team was out lol
Miami is a stong team and I think they are going to be even stronger this year. They picked up some talent this year
Yeah but they always seem to make good moves and play good durring most of the season. But they can never win the games they need too
Yeah I know what you mean. The games that count
Excatly the ones that matter most
Do we play you guys this year?
Im not sure I havent looked at the schedule yet
If so I think we take it
It would be a good game for sure
No doubt I would like to see it
