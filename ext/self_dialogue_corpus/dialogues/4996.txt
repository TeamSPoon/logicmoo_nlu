Hey, the angles are I town.did you see the game last night?
Yes, I can't believe it went so late last night.
I know, 3 homers from the angles and 5 from the Mets.
I can't believe the Mets tied it up in the 9th.
The angles had it, but you know their pitching.
Yeah, they need to spend more money.
Did, you see how mad the coach got when they tied it.
How, knew the Mets would come back to win.
I didn't see the start, how much where the angles winning by.
They were winning by 7 in the 3rd.
Wow, they really inched back.
They sure did. I did see when the hit that grand slam.
I know, what a shot.
Those Mets got all the runners on base with walks.
I have never seen that before.
Plus 3 grand slams?
I think, this was the highest scoring game ever.
I can't wait to see what happens tonight
Who is playing 1st base?
Don't know.
