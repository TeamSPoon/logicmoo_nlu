You remember the Gremlins movie?
Weren't there two of them?
Actually, I think there were.  I just don't even remember the second one.
Yeah, the first was so much better.
Did you like it?
Yeah, it was a pretty good movie.
What was the name of the first gremlin?
Gizmo!
Why was it named that again?
Oh, cause the man was an inventor.  I always figured that was why.
Oh, okay, because he made gizmos.
Yeah, it made sense to me.
I always felt bad when the other Gremlins started popping out of Gizmo.
Yeah, he looked like he was in pain.
He knew this would happen though.  Why did he eat the food?
I don't know.  I wondered that too.
Gizmo was good.  It's not like he wanted anything bad to happen.
It's funny how much different he was than the other gremlins.
Yeah, he was so clean.
Yeah, the others were so gross looking.
