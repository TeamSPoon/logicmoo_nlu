Hey who do you think is the worst rapper in the business today?
I can only pick one?
Yeah. Pick the absolute worst you can think of.
There are so many, but if I had to pick one it would be Nicki Minaj.
What? Why?
She is one of many rappers that degrade the genre rather than give it a positive light.
How do you come to that conclusion.
Name one song she's made that really had any kind of substance.
What do you mean exactly.
You kow, something that has a story to tell or an interesting message to the listeners.
I don't think she's done a song with an actual message in her music.
Exactly. It's always about her body, her sexual escapades and her wealth. Nothing of interest.
I get that but whats wrong with singing about that kind of stuff?
Well for one it's been done to death by every other rapper in the world.
I can agree with that.
Two, it's just not interesting. Here answer this. Who would you rather listen to Eminem or Nicki Minaj?
Eminem.
Want to know why?
Sure.
Because all of his music, every single song is interesting and a good listen.
