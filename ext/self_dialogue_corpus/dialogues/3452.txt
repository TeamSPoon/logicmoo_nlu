Do you think Rosemary's Baby is scary?
I do think it's scary.  It's so creepy.
I like how they don't show a lot of things. It's mostly atmosphere.
Yeah, that unknown part is the most scary thing.
Mia Farrow was well cast in it.
She looks innocent so that is a good contrast with the evilness.
I don't like to watch that movie at night.
I understand that.  I always get uneasy.
The score is very eerie.
It definitely adds to the feeling of being unsettled by something.
