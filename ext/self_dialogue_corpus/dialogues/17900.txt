Was Led Zeppelin from the 70's?
Yes
Are they from Europe?
Yes. A lot of good bands came from over there
I wish there were still good bands around
They are. They are just older
I wish there were some new up and coming bands that were good
The 70's had a lot more bands like that
I miss the old rock and roll days
They are not gone. Just pop in a CD
It's not the same
I see what you mean
Eric Clapton, Jimi Hendrix are two amazing guitarists
What is your point?
You don't see any more of them either
They are around. They just are not advertised
That's a good point
I think we should go to clubs and check out the new bands
Okay
There might be some good musicians playing there
