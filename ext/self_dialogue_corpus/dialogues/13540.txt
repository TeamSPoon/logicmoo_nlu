Do you like Star Wars?
I liked the original three, how about you?
Yeah I liked the first three as well and the new ones
The new ones meaning the prequels?
No, the ones that came out within the past couple of years
I thought there was just one
No there was another one
Really? I must've missed one
Yeah, there was one called Rogue One
I totally missed that one.
