Hmmm, this band started up recently, around the mid 2000s.
Yeah, honestly, there are better bands than these amateurs.
Well, I researched them on some of their collabs.
What came up?
Not much. These guys are only small timers.
I like rap and hip-hop so much more.
You think Eminem, or Jay-Z could pull this off?
If they were skilled enough at any instrument, yeah!
What about Martin Garrix, or Bruno Mars?
Martin Garrix's remixes are dope, and Bruno Mars is nice like that!
That's so true, man.
Yo, but I think it's good that we can listen to some other music for once.
Yeah, it's not like it's all 'bout the hip-pop, rap, and dance music.
Unless it's about them girls, though!
Yeahhh!!
Meh, I could buy a album for my girl, though!
You think she'd be into this stuff?
Not sure, depends.
What does she like?
Strutting in all of her furs, always got this full fur outfit on, like she about to walk out of Antartica.
