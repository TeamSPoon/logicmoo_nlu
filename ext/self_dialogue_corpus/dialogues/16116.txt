You know who you don't hear a lot these days about but you used to be real popular?
Who is that? That could refer to a lot of people.
Usher! He was so cute and such a great singer.
My good friend in high school had a huge crush on him.
Which of his songs were your favorite?
A lot of songs of his I loved but one of my faves was "Nice and Slow".
Yes I can hear that song right now in my head!
"I've got a real pretty pretty little thing that's waiting for me..."
Yes I loved that one!
He actually did a song with one of the singers from Destiny's Child.
I think I know who you mean.
It was Kelly Rowland.
Right! The song was called "My Boo" wasn't it?
Yes! I used to sing that to my boyfriend.
Even though in the song it's actually talking about cheating with someone else.
Right that's true. It was pretty good though.
I agree, it was.
Usher used to make all the ladies swoon.
Yes he did.
A true ladies man. I could picture his music videos right now.
