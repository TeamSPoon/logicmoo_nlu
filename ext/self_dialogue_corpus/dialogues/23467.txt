Hello! Are you where you can chat for a little bit?
I am free for  a few minutes. I am on break at work.
I was just taking a short break as well. I was thinking about when I worked in the video store.
Oh I didn't know you worked in a video store! Did you like doing that?
It was fun getting to have regular customers and having great people to work with.
That wasn't what I expected to hear. Did you get free rentals?
I certainly did and enjoyed it so much. One of my favorite movies that came out was "Undercover Brother"
I love that movie! It cracked me up!
The cast of that movie is star studded. I don't know who I liked the most.
Oh the one with Dave Chappelle, Denise Richards, Chris Kattan...etc
I never laughed so hard in my life just when you thought it couldn't get any crazier...it does.
I think I fell asleep in it but you have convinced me to watch it again.
There Is this one part with Neil Patrick Harris that surprised me so much that I thought I was going to wet my pants from laughing so hard
I like it when I find a movie that makes me feel like that.
I would recommend this movie to everyone of my customers. I bought that movie which is something I rarely did.
Well you sold me.
Definitely have someone watch it with you that likes comedy.
Will do and I will make some mood munchies for the best experience.
That's a great idea. Be sure it's 1970's themed snacks.
Talk to you later.
