Who is a female pop artist you like listening to?
I think probably Katy Perry.
Yeah she's pretty good.
She got her start in gospel music as a start.
That's interesting. I guess she writes her own music.
Some of it is amusing.
Like?
Like California Gurls. She's not taking some things seriously.
She's having a good time with it.
Firework is a touching song of hers!
