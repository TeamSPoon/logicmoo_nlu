I finally got to see Batman versus Superman.
How was it?
Terrible.
Why do you say that?
For starters, why does Batman use a gun in the movie?
I thought he was against guns in the comic and other movies.
He is, or was.
What did you think of the plot?
Which one?
What do you mean?
They were so many things going on, I don't know.
What about Wonder Woman?
She was pretty dope.
I hear she's getting a solo movie next.
Yeah, I bet it'll be better than Batman versus Superman.
How much did they fight in the movie?
Not much.
What do you mean not much?
There was more talk in that movie than anything else.
Well, I'm glad I didn't go see that one.
