Who's the greatest frontman of all time?
By that you mean lead vocalist?
Yes, who's the greatest lead vocalist of all time.
Easy. Freddy Mercury.
I can't really argue too much with that. Queen is an all time great band, and Freddy Mercury was the heart of Queen.
It's all about that magnetism on stage. You couldn't keep from focusing on him at all times.
Speaking of magnetism - What about Prince?
Does Prince even count as a frontman?
Well, he was the lead singer in all his songs.
I guess I just think of a frontman more in the context of vocalist, lead guitar, rythym guitar, bass guitar, drums. Prince's music is a little more outside the box.
That's true, but I still think he could count as a frontman.
Prince was pretty electric himself. But I'd still take Freddy Mercury.
How about Keith Morrison?
The Doors were a little bit before my time. Plus, how much of that was lifestyle and hype versus actual musicianship.
For a frontman, the lifestyle and hype can be just as important as the music.
I don't agree. The bottom line is always the music.
I just think that Rock n Roll as a concept goes beyond music. It's a lifestyle, a spirit or attitude.
For sure, it is. But the music is the foundation.
I can't disagree. And Freddie Mercury's music was wonderful.
Yeah, it's sad he's not with with us anymore.
