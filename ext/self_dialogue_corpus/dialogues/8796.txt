I agree Cobain was great. However, I don't think you can beat the rock music from the 1960's or 1970's.
Who is your favorite?
One of my all time favorites was Queen. Bohemian Rhapsody is classic song. Freddie Mercury as the lead was unbeatable.
I love that song. I love however how Adam Lambert sings it today with Queen.
Yes, he's good and he has a lot of charisma. But, in terms of charisma, nobody can top Mick Jagger and the Rolling Stones
All right I agree that and the library of music they created is amazing and still so viable today. All age groups know Satisfaction and It's Only Rock and Roll
There are so many great ones from that era such as the Beatles, Led Zeppelin,The Who, Creedence Clearwater, the Grateful Dead, Fleetwood Mac and even the Beach Boys.
I agree with your list and it doesn't even cover all of them. However the list from today is also impressive.
Who are your favorites from this decade?
There are so many but some of my favorites are Imagine Dragon, U2 and Red Hot Chili Peppers. I think both eras have a lot of spectacuiar groups.
