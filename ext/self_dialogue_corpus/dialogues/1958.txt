Have you been following the offseason news?
Yes I do everyday
What is the biggest story according to you?
I think the bears signing Mike Glennon for such a huge amount of money
Yeah I agree, what were they thinking?
Obviously they weren't thinking
And then they turned around and drafted a quarterback
That must've felt bad for Glennon
I would be mad if I were him
I heard the head coach didn't even know the bears were gonna do that
Yeah I would've felt betrayed by that
I think the coach certainly did
I think the bears are in a bad place for the upcoming year
Yeah, but they deserve it with those horrible off season moves
I feel bad for the fans
I know a few personally, and they really are starting to hate the team
Then they should make some changes without a doubt
I feel like some of those may be coming
It will be for the better though, the Bears cannot get much worse.
At least the fans can find solace in that
