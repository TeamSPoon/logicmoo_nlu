Have you seen the new Wonder Woman movie?
I have seen it! It was fantastic.
I could not agree more.
What do you think of the female only screening that they had?
I am neutral about it.  It can be biased but it makes sense for women to see it with each other.
I agree completely.
Are you planning to see the new Transformers?
I do. I think it will be magnificent.
Me too. I like that Mark Wahlberg is returning.
He plays the part great, though I do miss Shia LaBeouf.
He is the original one after all.
What about The Mummy?
I did not like that one at all.
Tom Cruise is a great actor, but I didn't like him for that as well.
I can't wait to see Baby Driver!
What is that about?
It is about a talented driver who has unique skills.
Oh right, I have seen the trailer.
Want to go see it with me?
Sure, I'm down.
