Are you looking forward to the preseason?
I heard they grabbed him in the first round.
I don't understand how hey got picked before Geno.
I hear you. Geno would kill Manuel on the field.
Can you image what was going through Geno's head when EJ held that jersey up?
Cutler and Romo both should be on a stranded island somewhere.
You know they pumped Geno up like he would get first round.
Maybe they all assumed New England would grab them.
Yeah, they probably didn't want to waste a pick they thought they wouldn't get.
He did have some impressive plays. None of them got Flacco to the finals.
I think they are rotating rookies until his return.
He wasn't awful, but definitely not worth writing home about.
He started in 2011.
For some reason he remind me of Vick, classic Vick.
Again, that's a team effort. Brady does not stand out of the pack.
Well, what good is Manning's accomplishments if they haven't helped his team get to the Super Bowl?
Ben, Brees, Romo, these guys would kill to play alongside Manning not Brady.
They could have had a killer starting line up off the drafts alone.
How much longer does Flacco have on his contract?
Now there is a biasis opinion.
