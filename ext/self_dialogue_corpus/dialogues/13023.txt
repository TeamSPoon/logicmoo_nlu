Did you like the Princess Leia character?
Yes, she grew on me after awhile
Yeah, I thought she was kind of annoying at first
Right, but then she got better towards the end
And then there was the whole bikini outfit
Oh yeah, a big hit with the male demographic
Unfortunately she was pretty bad in the Force Awakens
Well, Carrie Fisher has had some issues for quite awhile.
Yes, that is true. Sad she died recently.
Yes, RIP Carrie Fisher.
