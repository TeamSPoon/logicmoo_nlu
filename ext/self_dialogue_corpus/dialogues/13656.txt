What year did Return of the Jedi come out?
I think 1983
That long ago?!
Yes, crazy. We were just little kids back then
I loved the ewoks.
Yeah, but if you watch it now it seems really campy with the ewoks
Oh really, I haven't seen it lately
Yeah, it definitely hasn't aged well.
I guess that makes sense considering how long it's been
Yeah, some parts still hold up well
