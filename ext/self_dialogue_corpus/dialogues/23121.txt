Have you seen the new Ansol Elgort movie?
Another DIvergent film?
No, it is called Baby Driver.
No, who else is in it?
Lily James and Kevin Spacey.
I love Kevin Spacey in anything.
Even some movies that should be silly were good with him in it.
I thought he was the perfect Bobby Darrin.
I loved him in K-Pax.
That movies does not get the credit it deserves.
I think this new movie will not either.
What is it about?
There is a kid with an injury, he ends up being a get away driver.
How is it rated?
It actually scored a 98% as far as ratings go.
Well, I might have to check it out if those can be trusted.
I do not think they can, Zoolander got almost a zero.
The first Zoolander was so funny.
The cameos in that film alone earned it a high score to me.
Unlike the trash that was Zoolander 2.
