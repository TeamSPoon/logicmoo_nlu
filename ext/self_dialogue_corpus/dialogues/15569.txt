The Beach Boys were a good band.
Sure were and they could really harmonize.
I think they first came out in the very early 1960's.
Yes their first album was called Surfin in 1961.
Yes but I think the album in 1936 really hit home with Good Vibrations.
Now that was a great song.
They had a lot of great hits.
Yup, Like Help Me Rhonda, 409 and Surfer Girl
.Those were some of my favorites.
They were a great California band.
Yea there were three brothers, a cousin and a friend when they first started.
Yea and two of the brothers died untimely deaths. Dennis drowned and Carl died of Lung Cancer.
That is a shame.
Yea and the other brother Brian had mental issues and substance abuse.
Well,their music was superb and loved by everyone.
You are right.
They had a great sound like no other band.
That is for sure.
I would have loved to see them play.
Me too.
