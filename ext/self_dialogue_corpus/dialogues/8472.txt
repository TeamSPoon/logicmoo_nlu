Who is your Favorite pop star?
My favorite is definitely Katy Perry she has a great energy in her music.
I did really enjoy Hot n Cold her 2008 hit.
I enjoy that song but did not discover her music until teenage dream in 2010.
I liked California Gurls from that album.
I really liked the song I kissed a girl from the album one of the boys which is some of her earlier work.
Did you know she started out doing christian music in the early 2000s?
I had heard about that but I havent listened to any of her ealier music out side of her pop music.
It is actually decent music though her pop music is much better.
I will have to listen to it when I get a chance, and I look forward to her future music.
