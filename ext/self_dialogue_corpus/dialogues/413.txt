Did you see the movie Dr. Strange?
Yes, but I may have fallen asleep during part of it.
You're kidding me! How could you fall asleep?
I saw it really late and it just didn't really hold my attention.
I loved that movie! Don't you like Benedict Cumberbatch?
Yeah, but for some reason he just didn't hold my attention in that movie.
He was great in it! He was perfect for the part.
I guess I'm not that familiar with Dr. Strange in general, so I wouldn't know if he was good in that role.
I don't really know much about Dr. Strange either, but I still thought he was great.
Maybe I'll have to watch it again and stay awake this time!
