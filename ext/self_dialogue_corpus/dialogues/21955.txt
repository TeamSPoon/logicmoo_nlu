hey harry
what it do mate?
not bad just home bored so was thinking if we could see a movie at the cinema in couple of hours.
its okay,Ann is out with her friends so sure i am open to it, what we seeing though?
i was thinking we could see "sleepless".
and who is on it?
jamie foxx.
oh Jamie, okay, i have never been disapointed on any of the movie he's on,so hope this pass the mark as well.
just reading through the story line makes me want to see it, although there are several other new movies on schedule but "sleepless" got more reviews and all positive.
no worries then we see "sleepless".
i am happy for Jamie though, he finally hold on to something.
hahaha oyeah dude was trying so many stuff, he did music, stand up comedy and acting, but seems the acting paid off.
yeah he his now very popular because of his role on movies, he really didn't do well at music and comedy.
white house down is still my all time favorite Jamie foxx movie.
oh white house down would go down as a classic, i love that movie,and Channing Tatum's daughter was exception in the movie too, my daughter loves her.
oh dear, she did brilliantly well, have seen her on other couple of movies aside that,and not bad, she just need a lead role on a big movie and she would be there.
had she is the daughter of Daria King.
oh that is very possible, her name is joey King.
oh then she just might be her daughter,would google and check though.
no problem mate, let me get some laundry done and get set before you get to mine.
