Why is it that every time I come into your room, you are listening to some 80's song?
Because I like the music. That was a great musical decade.
I know. I am just surprised that you listen to my generations music in 2017.
Old but GOLD. Still listening in to The Police "Every Breath You Take" in 2017.
One of the many good songs in the "Fields of Gold.
You need to stop.
You do realize he is talking about stalking someone, right?
What? Really, are you sure?
Yes, he even admitted it﻿.
I didn't know that.
He did though,but it's cool that the song can be interpreted in multiple ways.﻿
Doesn't change the fact that it's a musical masterpiece.
This is the stalkers national song.
No it's the police's..
Did they not realize the irony with the name of their band?﻿
What do you mean?
Its ironic  that their band name is the "Police" and they made this song which kinda describes the actual police and government now with them watching us all the time.
I never thought about it like that but yeah you're right.
But with internet, anyone can watch/stalk you.
I'm sure they didn't intend for their fans to be having this kind of conversation about their band name when they created it.
