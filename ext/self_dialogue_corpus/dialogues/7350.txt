Did you see where there's going to be a remake of the movie Watcher in the Woods?
I never the original, what was it about?
A couple with two children rent a home in the country and weird things start to happen to the daughters
Who plays in it?
The parents are David McCallum and Carroll Baker. Bette Davis plays the woman they rent the house from.
I like to see all them play. Bette Davis was one of my favorites.
Well her character's daughter disappeared years before and was never found. The daughters of the couple start having strange things happen to them that and Bette Davis thinks it has to do with her daughter.
What's the strange things that happen?
Well, the oldest daughter starts seeing an image of a girl blindfolded in mirrors and hearing voices.
I'm going to have to watch that one!
