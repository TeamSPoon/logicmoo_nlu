Did you see the Red Sox game last night?
I watched it until the fifth inning then i fell asleep!
Wow, you missed an unbelievable ending!
Really?
Yeah, they came back from a huge deficit.
No kidding?
Yeah they were down by eight runs and came back to tie it in the ninth inning.
That's impressive.
Yeah, Sandy Leon hit a grand slam in the bottom of the ninth inning.
He is on hot streak lately.
Yeah, John Farrell has decided to go with the hot hand at catcher.
I like that strategy.
Yeah, he has been hitting for power lately.
They should start him as much as possible.
Agreed!  The bullpen played great as well.
Who pitched?
Embree came in for the seventh inning, Barnes for the eigth, and Kimbrel for the ninth to close the game.
That's a good combination.
Yeah, Kimbrel struck out the side to end the game.
Awesome, too bad i missed that!
