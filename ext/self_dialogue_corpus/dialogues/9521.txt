Who is your favorite rap artist?
I can only pick one?
Yeah, if there was only one to listen to for the rest of your life who would it be?
I'd have to pick Eminem.
Interesting. Why did you choose him?
His songs actually have a lot of meaning and substance to them.
Meaning I get but what do you mean in terms of substance?
Well it's not just a beat and lyrics. You get a story in almost all of his songs. He has the most variety.
I can agree with that. He's done comedy, real life topics, and hype songs as well.
Exactly, with Eminem you have a true total package rapper.
