Hi Danielle!
Hi Tabitha!
Do you remember any of the lines from when you starred as Belle in the Troupe production of "Beauty and the Beast?"
Yeah. Almost all of them.
No way!
Well, I just watched the Disney version of that again last night, so...
No surprise there!
Right.
What was your favorite line?
"Life is a box of chocolates." But, of course, that was Forest Gump!
