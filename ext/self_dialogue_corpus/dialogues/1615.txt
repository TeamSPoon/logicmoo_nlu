There's only a couple more months and then the wait is finally over!
You must be talking about football season, I can't wait to see how my team does this year!
Who is your team? I'm a big Jets fan...sadly.
I'm sorry to hear that!  I'm a Giants fan, but I do pull for the Jets as long as their not playing eachother.
I feel the same way.  Growing up my father was a Giants fan and my Grandfather was a Jets fan, so I always pull for both.
Do you remember the one year when they thought there would be a "subway series" between the 2 teams!?
I think that was back in 2008, that would of been amazing if it happened.
At least the Giant's have won a few superbowls and who could forget the most recent in 2012.
Oh yes, I did love that the Giants beat the patriots that year; I can't stand the Patriots.
Me either, they are cheaters and I hope they do horrible this year.
I do too, however unfortunately it seems like they'll never have a loosing season.
I don't like Tom Brady, he's so cocky and then there's the whole "deflate gate"!
He is such a loser and I hate that people from Boston will defend him till the day they die.
Once a cheater always a cheater; thats why they call the coach BeliCHEAT!
I don't like that guy either, remember the scandal where he got caught filming the Jets during practice??
How could I forget it! That just shows they need to cheat in order to succeed, I just hope the Jets beat them at least once this year.
I'm sure they will, they usually win one and loose the other against the Patriots.
Who do you think will be in the Superbowl this year?
It's tough to say before the season starts, but I'd love to see Jets vs. Giants in my lifetime.
HA! Me too, but then we can't be friends anymore lol.
