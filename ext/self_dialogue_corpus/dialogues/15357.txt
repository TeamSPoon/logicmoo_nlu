Have you heard of Aesop Rock?
I have heard a couple of his songs but not much.
He has a concert coming up, you interested?
I am not sure, do you have any song recommendations I can listen to in order to see if I would be interested
Of course, one of his older songs is No Regrets.
Which album is it on?
I am actually not sure but it should be easy to find.
Any other recommendations?
Daylight is another older song of his that is great.
I have heard that one before, it is interesting.
His most accessible album is None Shall Pass.
I think I may have heard a song off that too.
Was it called None Shall Pass?
Yep, you got it.
That is a great song, the rest of the album has a similar vibe.
I did really enjoy None Shall Pass, I will check that album out.
Sounds good, the concert is next week.
I will let you know tomorrow what I think!
Sounds good, hope to hear from you soon!
Have a good one!
