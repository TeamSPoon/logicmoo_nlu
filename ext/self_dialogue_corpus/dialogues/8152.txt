Do you know a lot about Sia?
I don't. But I love her song "Unstoppable."
Did you know that she was a popular songwriter before she was famous?
I did not! What did she write?
She wrote "Diamonds" actually
Is that the Rihanna song?
It is! Isn't it a beautiful song?
It really is. I had no idea Sia wrote it.
It's true. Not only is she a great singer, but she is a great songwriter too.
That is probably why songs like Unstoppable are so catchy!
