What movie are you most excited about this year?
There are a few amazing ones coming out later this year.
A few already came out too.
I was really pumped about Logan.
Who was in that movie?
Hugh Jackman, it was a Wolverine film.
Oh, right, it looked so sad.
It was a real turn from the other X-Men type movies.
Most different form DeadPool I imagine.
Well, it was also rated R so maybe not.
What about some DC movies?
I can not wait to see Justice League.
Do you think it will be any good?
I hope it will play well into the lore of DC.
I am concerned for Aqua Man the most.
He seems like he may be a lot different than Superman.
I think he is more of a secondary character.
Do you think Wonder Woman will get a lot of screen time in that one?
I hope so, even though she has her own movie.
So do Batman and Superman.
