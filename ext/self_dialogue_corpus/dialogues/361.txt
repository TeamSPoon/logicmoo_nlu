Do you think Marvel will continue making super hero films?
Yes they are funded by Disney.
I forgot about that.
Yeah so they only have phases but I cannot see them actually stopping.
Have they announced phases going forward?
Not after the third one.
So maybe the 4th they have new actors take over the characters?
I think that could be a possibility
It would be weird to see a new Captain America
Yeah I think so too
