How do you feel about the Raiders moving to Las Vegas?
I think it's really disappointing.
Yeah, you have been a Raider fan ever since they moved back to Oakland
I feel like the ownership really didn't make any effort to stay in Oakland and I think its a crummy way to treat such a loyal fanbase
Well, they paid good money to Carr to keep him for the future.
Yeah, I think he's great and hopefully we can make the most of the remaining time they have in Oakland
How do you feel about the acquisition of Marshawn Lynch?
Beastmode! I think it's aweosme.
Yeah, that was a great move for your team
I thought it was so cool that he said he would only to come play for us.
I always respect a player who wants to come back to his hometown and show some love to the hometown fans
Its cuz the Raiders have the best fans in the league!
Some people would beg to differ.
That's just because they haven't been to a game.  The fans are really loyal, but we're also really cool.
What about the Black Hole?
Yeah, we're the only team without a mascot.  The fans are the mascot for the Raiders.  The Black Hole is amazing.  People only think they're scary.
Do you think you'll stay a fan after the move?
I can't really see that happening.  I feel like the only people that will attend the Vegas games are fans of the visiting teams who also wanted a vacation, and guests of corporate bigwigs.
Yeah, I think Vegas will kinda suck the soul out of the team and the fanbase.
At least my Sundays will be a lot more free in the fall!
