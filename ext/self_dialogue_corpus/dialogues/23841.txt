So are you into the new Star Wars movies or do you just like the originals?
I'm old school, all the way.
What don't you like about the new ones?
The new ones are so corny and not at all like the original trilogy.
I understand that about the Episode I, II and III, but what about The Force Awakens and Rogue One?
Those are better but I still feel like the acting is pretty cheesy, especially Felicity Jones.
What, you don't like female lead roles?
I do, if the female can actually act.
You don't think Felicity Jones is a good actress?
No, I think she looks and sounds like a chipmunk.
Well, now that you say that, I can see it.
Do you like the newer movies?
I love the new ones, especially John Boyega and Oscar Isaac's characters.
The Force Awakens is probably the best one out of everything made after the originals.
What do you think about the shots of the fallen Star Destroyer?
Oh now, the cinematography was incredible in both The Force Awakens and in Rogue One.
In Rogue One, the city under the Star Destroyer was incredible.
I will agree with that, it's just the movies don't have the magic that the original three had.
I like the new ones, but I see what you are saying about the magic.
Everything came together and had that spark in the first three.
