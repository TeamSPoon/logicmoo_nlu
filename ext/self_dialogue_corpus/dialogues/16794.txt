What kind of music do you like?
I like just about everything, but I really like the classics.
Me too!  I love Guns N Roses
Me too!  Axel Rose sure was wild in his day
I heard they just announced a new tour.
That would be a great concert!  I'd probably pay just about anything to go.
I would too. You know who else puts on a good show? Metallica.
Definitely!  I saw them when I was a kid.
Me too and I haven't forgotten that concert!
What other concerts have you been to?
I've seen Journey and I'll be seeing REO Speedwagon next month.
Oh yeah?  I love their music too.  I have tickets to see Kid Rock this summer down in Detroit.
He puts on a good show.  I saw him once.
How was the show?
It was great.  He surprised the crowd and flew in Run DMC!
No way!  That's crazy!
I know!  I also saw Nickleback a few years ago and they were good too.
Yeah?  What did you like about their concert?
They had amazing pyrotechnics at their concert and their drummer did an awesome solo.
I'd like to see that!
