Of the Beatles, do you consider yourself more of a John or a Paul fan?
I always loved John, the way he'd push the creative envelope. You just never knew what he'd do next.
Now that you mention it, I could have seen that from the style of eyeglasses that you're wearing.
Yes, I love the look, but more the songs, like I Am the Walrus.
How about his lesser known ones? Any I should know?
I always had a soft spot for Julia, from the White Album. It's so wistful.
Good to know. I've always been more of a Paul person myself--just an incomparable body of work.
Yes, I can't deny he seemed to be a more disciplined writer with quite an ear for melody.
And I think his solo work stands up better. Band on the Run is one of my favorite records of all time.
Touche. But I'd gladly trade all of 1980s Paul for Imagine!
