So, I just read a piece about the top 100 movies of all time.
And, how many had you seen.
Not as many as I thought.
I read something similar, I had never heard of a few of the movies.
One of them is called "Tootsie", ever seen it.
I have seen that one!
Is it worth being on the list?
It is very funny, and kind of heart warming.
The top one is Godfather.
That one is worth the top spot.
I have never seen it.
How? It has love, drama and mob action.
Just never got around to it.
Marlon Brando put cotton in his mouth to produce the sound of his voice in that film.
I know a few lines, from here and there and it seem likes a good film.
The whole trilogy is a masterpiece.
Is it just about like mob stuff?
It follows a crime family though a few generations, there is just so much.
I will check it out.
Make sure you watch all three, believe me you will not regret it.
