A lot of coaches in the NFL seem to have a cult of personality
Absolutely. Mike Ditka was a good coach but also fun to watch.
I think people feel the same way about Sean Payton
The Saints coach?
Yes. He wrote a book
Yeah, but he still seems kind of boring.
True. White bread for sure.
It seems like the NFL has a minority coaching problem
Yeah there aren't too many nonwhite coaches.
Ron Rivera, for the Panthers.
I think the Chargers have Anthony Lynn
Yeah, and I think there a handful more
What do you think they should do to fix it?
I guess just try harder to encourage and support minority coaches.
They should get more female referees and coaches as well
For sure. Women know just as much about the game these days
They even play it now.
Kathryn Smith works for the Bills as a coach
Oh right I forgot about her.
And the Cardinals had Jennifer Welter
