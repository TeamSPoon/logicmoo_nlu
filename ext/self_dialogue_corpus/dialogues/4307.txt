Did you ever see the old Hitchcock film Vertigo?
I know I did but I don't remember it that well.
I love Hitchcock. Did you see The Birds?
I sure did and was terrified of birds for weeks after that.
I know, a lot of people were. He's such a great director.
My favorite movie by him is Psycho. That's a classic.
That's hands down his best movie. No one saw the twist at the end coming.
Norman Bates is definitely a crazy character to be reckoned with.
All the Psycho sequels that came after that were no good.
Right I think they should have left it alone as it was.
