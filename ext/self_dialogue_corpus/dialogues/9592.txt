Man oh man, this beat is sick.
What beat, all I hear is gunshots.
Yeah! Its gangster rap!
Please, thats nothing like the classics.
What do you know about rap?
In the 90s I was all about that life. Tupac, Biggie, and the rest.
Really, a white guy like you?
I'm a gangster on the inside.
Better keep it there, weirdo.
Word up.
