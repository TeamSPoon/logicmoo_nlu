Have you been watching the NBA Playoffs?
I have, but mostly when Golden State Warriors are playing.
I know.  I love Golden State. I love Steph Curry especially.
Me too. I like them because they are humble.
They always look like they're having fun.
Yes, and I feel there is no animosity or jealousy among teammates.
I know, I was sad when they lost last year.
Me too.  Do you like Lebron James?
I used to, but I saw him being rude to Guillermo from Jimmy Kimmel Show.
He is a great player, but sometimes attitude comes through.
That's why I like Steph Curry. He has a great sense of humor.
I know, he's always dancing, and doing stuff with and for fans.
Not so happy with the wife though.  HaHa
I started watching basketball about two years ago, after seeing Curry on the All Star Games.
Oh. Ive been watching for a long while.  I used to like the Heat.
I think The Heat was good.  Mostly when Lebron was there, but also with out him.
I think Dwayne Wade is a great player.
Im surprised they didnt make the playoffs.
Well, this will be year three in a row that the Cavs and Warriors are in, I think.
Well Im rooting for the Warriors!!!
