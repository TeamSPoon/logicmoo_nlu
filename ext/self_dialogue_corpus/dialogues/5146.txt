The Rockies are playing well this season.
I know. It's surprising how well they're playing.
It's like the Rockies are the team in the NL West that can hit left handers.
LOL. The Giants are awful against LHP.
Dodgers too. The Dodgers should be running away but they haven't been able to hit lefties.
Yeah, the Dodgers are under-performing for sure. Giants are always up and down.
Better than the Padres though.
Padres actually have some good young talent too. Myers is good when healthy.
Still well behind Dodgers with Seager, Urias, and Puig if he has his head on straight.
For sure. I think LA will get on a roll eventually. Too much talent to languish.
If the Rockies keep playing well they'll be right in the mix.
Arenado is a beast.
Agree. It's only a matter of time before he puts up some MVP caliber stats.
He's had some good seasons already to be in the conversation.
True, but he's still got growth to have a real year of mashing.
Especially in Colorado.
Do you think that helps or hurt his chances at getting MVP consideration?
Good question. I mean on one hand the park inflates his numbers but on the other hand his splits aren't that dramatic.
Plus there's the fact he has some other talented guys in that lineup.
Right, but lately they weigh your club's success with it too. All the more reason to keep the team rolling.
