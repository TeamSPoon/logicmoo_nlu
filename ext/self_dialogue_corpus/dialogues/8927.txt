Have you listened to Fritz and the Tantrums
Once or twice I think theyve been on
I really think they make some great music
I dont know I havent paid attention to it much.
They have music that can appeal to anyone
So it has a fuller sound?
That and their lyrics are relevant
In what way?
They can be interpreted in so many ways
I guess thats the mark of a great band.
