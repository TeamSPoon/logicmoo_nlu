Will DC have the same film success that Marvel has had
No I think Marvel has a certain way they do their films that works.
So DC couldnt use it?
I mean they have Batman but havent developed anyone else.
Like who?
Anyone, Ironman integrated other characters.
So whos fault is it?
I guess you could say the producers.
Or the writers in this case?
Maybe but DC needs to mimic Marvel's approach to film
