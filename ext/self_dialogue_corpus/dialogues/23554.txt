Let's talk about Mel Gibson.
Oh, man. This'll get dark.
What do you think about him?
As a person, director, or actor?
Any and all.
He's a brilliant director, a decent action actor, and an absolutely horrible person.
Really, why?
You know about his drunken rant, right?
No, what happened?
Like, almost a decade ago, he got drunk and pulled over by a cop and went on a long tirade against women and jews.
At a traffic stop?
Yup. Great guy, right?
But what about his movies?
They're very well-directed and action-packed. Hacksaw Ridge was awesome.
You know I don't watch action.
So what did you see?
What Women Want.
Wasn't that the one where he can read minds and learns to deal with it?
Yeah, it was pretty funny but got serious enough.
I saw it when it came out but can't remember if I liked it or not.
