So, apparently, Ewan McGregor wants to do an Obi-Wan Kenobi spin-off Star Wars film.
Then should let him. I don't think people would complain.
It makes more sense than the Young Han Solo film starring none of the original actors.
Which is still better than making a fake, CGI, young Han Solo, honestly.
Yeah, yeah, but my point is that McGregor is at the perfect age to play Obi-Wan during the era between Episodes III and IV.
So you want a midquel basically?
If it would work. Though if they wait too long to make it, he'll get old and they'll have to recast Obi-Wan yet again.
Or CGI young and just have him do the voice.
They'd just get James Arnold Taylor to voice him in that. He's  technically played Obi-Wan more than anyone because of that.
Huh. Never would've guessed.
