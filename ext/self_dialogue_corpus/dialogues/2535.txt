Are you looking forward to the NFL season?
I sure am.  It's going to be a great year for football?
Why do you say that?
I am a Patriots fan, and they're always good.
Hmmm...last time we were together you were a Bronco's fan.  What's up with that?
Oh, well, since Peyton Manning retired, they haven't been very good, so I switched to the Patriots.
Wow.  What happens when Tom Brady retires?
If the Patriots don't do good, I will find some other team to follow.
Wow.
What?  Who is your favorite team?
The Dallas Cowboys.
Hmmm...They just got good a few years ago too.
Yeah, but I was a fan of them when they were terrible.
Yeah, sure.
It's true.  There are pictures of me as a kid wearing Dallas Cowboys shirts and stuff.
Really?  I guess that's impressive.
Well, they are my team, and even though I like for them to win, I will cheer for them when they lose too.
Good for you.  Maybe I should just stick to one team.
I think that would be a good idea.  Who will you pick?
I don't know, lets see who wins the Super Bowl this year, then I will decide.
