What ever happened to U2?
What do you mean?
They don't seem to be around as much.
But they're still around.
I guess they'll never break up.
They just had a world tour, I think.
Once upon a time, you couldn't walk ten feet without seeing Bono's face on something.
Yes, they aren't as ubiquitous as they used to be.
I guess I appriciate how they're around, but not in your face.
Yes, I'm sure they appreciate it too.
