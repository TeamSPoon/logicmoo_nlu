Did you know Jay-Z has a new album coming out tomorrow?
No! I didn't hear that. That is so exciting.
I know! It has been so long since he came out with new music.
It really has, what was his last album again?
I think it was Watch The Throne.
Is that the one he did with Kanye West?
Yeah. It was so great.
I don't think that is the latest album of his.
Then what is?
I think it was the one he did with Justin Timberlake.
Oh yeah! You are right, what was that one called again?
Magna Carta Holy Grail.
Right. That was a great album.
It really was. I loved the song called Tom Ford.
Same! My favorite song on that album had to be Part II though.
Beyonce was featured on that one right?
Yeah! I love it when they collaborate!
Me too.
I hope she is on the new album.
Thanks for telling me about his new album. I can't wait!
