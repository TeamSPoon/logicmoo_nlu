What you do last night?
I stayed in and watched a movie.
What did you watch?
I watched Menace To Society.
Oh, I liked that. It is one of my favorites.
You can tell it's dated though.
Why you say that?
Dude jacked my man for his rims at the hamburger joint. Who does that anymore?
I know right. And how about when cousin Harold got shot at the red light?
You know. Somebody pull up on me at a red light and I'm packing?
You know what I mean. He want to do all that stalling, I would have just started shooting.
And how about when them fools was sitting around watching the robbery tape?
Kane was a fool for letting his homie make copies.
That's how fools get jammed up, doing something dumb.
Yeah but hating ass old head was all jealous of Kane, that's why he told.
Naw, he told because Kane pistol-whipped him at the party.
Old head got what he had coming, being all disrespectful in Jada Pinkett's crib.
Kane was a clown though. He stomped the cousin down all willy-nilly.
That's because he ain't want to man-up and be a father to that chick's kid.
Got himself jammed up in the end though.
