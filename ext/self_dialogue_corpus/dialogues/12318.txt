I wonder if the new Han Solo movie will be good?
That is difficult to say, although they did hire Ron Howard.
A good director is essential.
I wonder if we will learn more about Wookies.
If nothing else, we should see the origin of Han and Chewbacca.
Has the home planet been shown before?
I do not believe so, unless you count the Christmas special on television.
That would definitely be a mistake!
I am also looking forward to learning more about Lando.
Definitely!    Hope Donald Glover learned something from the coolest - Billy Dee Williams!
