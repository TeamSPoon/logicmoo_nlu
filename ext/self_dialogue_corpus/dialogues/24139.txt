Have you ever seen the original Wizard of Oz?
Yes but not in a very long time.
What do you remember most about the movie?
The wicked witch. And you?
I remember when it turns to color and all the munchkins come out.
Oh I forgot about that, I thought that was magic.
I also loved all the music.
Follow the yelow brick road, follow the yellow brick, ...
I think they carried the tune better but yes.
Remember Glinda the good witch?
She was so so beautiful I remember. I wanted to be her.
Not Dorthy with the ruby shoes?
Well maybe a little bit but the witch was prettier.
What about the Tinman, scarcrow and lion, who was your favorite?
I liked the scarecrow. And you?
Same, I liked the way he danced. What was it he was seeking from the wizard?
A heart, no it was courage.
Did it scare you?
Definately, the monkeys still freak me out.
We should watch that tonight.
