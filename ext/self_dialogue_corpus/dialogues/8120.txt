Do you have any favorite pop singers these days?
A few, but currently Taylor Swift is my favorite.
I hope she comes out with a new album soon. It's been a while.
I haven't heard anything about a new album, but I'd love to hear one.
I also have been listening to a lot of Adele lately.
She has such a powerful voice.
I can't remember the last time I've heard anyone sing with as much soul as her.
Yeah, she's like a blast from the past. A real artist who can actually sing.
Did you watch her at the Grammy's?
Yes, her performance was super powerful and gave me chills.
