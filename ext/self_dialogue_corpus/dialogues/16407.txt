Did you see Katy Perry in Carpool Karaoke?
Yeah, I just saw that on YouTube today.
What did you think?
I think she'd be fun at parties.
She seems fun, but ditsy. But, what about her music?
Well, there's a reason I said she'd be fun at parties.
You didn't like her?
She sounded awful. She has no natural singing voice and she was out of tune the entire time.
Ouch.
Seriously, she was bad. Did you hear her try to harmonize?
Yeah, she actually did it.
But it was boring harmonization. It didn't add anything other than "look at what I can do"
I thought she sounded good.
Yes, but as we've established, you have awful taste and can't tell when someone is out of tune or not.
Well, sorry for trying to just have fun.
I do have fun. I just want professional musicians work tens of millions to be able to come through in a live performance.
It was in a car for two hours.
So?
You're impossible.
Well, she and Mariah Carey are the only ones to not be able to do it. Everyone else sounded awesome.
