Did you see puege play last night?
No, what happened?
He had a homer in the 5th.
Nice, anyone on base?
Yeah, pederson.
Sweet, that dude is of the hook as well.
I know, the whole team is doing good.
Yup, they are fighting for first place.
With who, the giants?
No, the Rockies.
Didn't they just play a series with them?
Yeah, the Dodgers took 2 of 3.
Usually it's the giants that are batting, not the Rockies.
It's baseball, you never know.
Right is Dodgers and giants.
That's right, they are playing in San Francisco.
That should be good.
I know, two rivals.
I how no one gets hurt.
I know, good luck fans.
