Don't know about you but, I can't wait for the NFL season to kick off.
Me either. I actually bought the NFL package so I can watch any game I want each week.
I see Tom Brady is either now or will soon be 40. Wonder what kind of a year he is going to have.
I think he has a way of winning regardless of who he is working with on offense.
The second half of the last Superbowl was flat crazy.
I am not a Patriot fan but, I was totally impressed with them coming back from a 28-3 deficeit.
I think the Falcons showed they had not been in a Superbowl and the Patriots showed they had.
Falcons just got way too convervative in the second half and that cost them dearly.
Who do you think will be in this years Superbowl?
That is a tough question. Wild guess..Green Bay & Pittsburg.
Who would you want to see win with that matchup?
The Green & Gold Packers. My favorite team.
Why are the Packers your favorite team?
I was born in Wisconsin and started following them as a 5 year old.
Who is your all-time favorite?
Has to be Bart Starr. I loved watching him.
What do you think made the Packers of the 60's such an outstanding team?
Vince Lombardi. Broke my heart when he left Green Bay.
What is your opinion of Aaron Rodgers?
I think he is the best quarterback in football hands down.
