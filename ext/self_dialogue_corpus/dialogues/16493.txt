Will music change their business model?
How so?
I just dont see the allure of buying CDs.
I think that they have already moved away from that platform.
I just dont see how digital sales can be completely ignored.
They arent, thats how they figure numbers out.
I am just surprised we dont see a different model outside of that.
I am not following, how else would you monetize it?
Ticket sales for shows.
Some bands dont go on tour as much.
I know but I think thats how bands make money.
I believe in music they make money off of merchandise sales.
Well that could be it
I dont love the way the music industry is modeled anymore though.
I agree, it seems like smaller bands get squeezed.
I just think we are seeing the abandonment of DIY ethics as well.
Thats just the world we live in.
But bands dont tour nearly as much anymore.
I think its the grind that hurts the most.
You could say that but I dont agree
