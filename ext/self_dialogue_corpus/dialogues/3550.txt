Do you remember Jeepers Creepers?
It sounds familiar.  Was that a movie?
Yeah, a horror movie.
Oh, was it the one with the monster with the eyes.
I don't remember right, but I think he'd eat eyes.
Oh, yeah, something like that.
And that song would play everytime he'd come.
Yeah, "Jeepers Creepers."
Was that a real song?
Yeah, I think from the forties or something.
