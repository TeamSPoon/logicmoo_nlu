My favorite pop song of all time is Hit Me Baby by Britney Spears.
That's an odd but respectable classic pick.
When you hear it you can't help but sing along.
This much is true, Britney was good at that.
We're even seeing her song Toxic kind of make a comeback.
Yeah which is odd out of nowhere.
Out of nowhere indeed, my kid sister has been blasting it.
Has it been getting radio airplay again?
Not that I know of, just seems to be an internet thing.
Leave it to the internet for dig up old tunes.
