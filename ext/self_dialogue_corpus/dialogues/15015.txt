I need to laugh, what's a good comedy movie?
Have you seen Superbad?
Is that the one with Jonah HIll and Micheal Cera?
That's the one. Its hilarious.
I really like Micheal Cera. He was awesome in Scott Pilgrim VS The World.
That was a good movie. It stuck really close with the comic books.
That's what I thought too. Did you see This Is The End?
I wasn't really a fan of that one. I thought it would be funnier than it was.
Really? I thought it was pretty good.
I think we'll have to agree to disagree here.
