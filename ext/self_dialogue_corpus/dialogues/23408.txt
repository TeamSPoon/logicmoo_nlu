Did you see Ace Ventura is currently being remade?
I did not catch that.
Without Jim Carrey though.
That makes little to no sense.
I agree, but thats the direction they are headed in.
I think the movie was funny but doesnt need a reboot.
Yeah plus I think the actor will be judged against it as well.
Why would they not allow him to be in it?
I dont think thats the case.
So, he doest want to do the film?
Its been over 20 years who wants to visit it again?
They did make sequels.
And I do not know if they were as great.
It also spawned an animated series.
Thats where it got weird.
The film was not intended for kids.
Right so they almost dumbed it down.
I think it was a bit inappropriate as well.
I just dont get why they do this kind of stuff.
Hopefully the remake or reboot never sees the light of day
