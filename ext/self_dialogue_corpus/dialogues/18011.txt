We're having a Fourth of July party this year.
That's great! I was wondering who would host one.
We decided that this would definitely be the year for us.
That's exciting! Can I help with anything?
Actually you can. I need some help choosing the music.
Well, what did you have in mind?
I wanted to pick out some songs that just feel very American, without being overly patriotic.
So, long, American songs you can party to?
Yeah, exactly.
Well, Miley Cyrus' "Party in the USA" seems like an obvious choice then.
I don't know how I didn't think of that sooner.
Me either.
Any other ideas?
Maybe some Springsteen?
I've never listened to much Springsteen.
You should. Born in the USA would be the perfect album for a party like this.
Okay. Any other ideas?
Hmm. I'm starting to run low.
Let's find someone else to ask.
Okay!
