Have you seen The Zookeeper's Wife?
Yeah I did about a month ago.
What did you think?
I thought it was so moving.  It really made me think of cruelty and how it comes about in people.
Yeah I agree it was incredibly moving, but didn't make me feel heavy, like other movies.
I agree. Some movies make you feel horrible after watching them, like Schindler's List.
Exactly! They're just too heavy.
What did you think of the script?
I read the book, so I was a little disappointed in the script because the book is so much better.
I didn't know there was a book.
Yeah there is, but I guess it is hard to be as good as a book.
That's true.  I really liked the lead actress, but I forget her name.
Jessica Chastain.
That's right! She was wonderful.
I'm trying to think of other movies that she was in. Was she in The Martian?
Yeah I think she was! She was also in The Help.
It's surprising that she isn't in more movies I think she's a great actress.
I agree, but we can't control Hollywood.
That's true, we just have to appreciate what we have in those movies.
Yes we do!
