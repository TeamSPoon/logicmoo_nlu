What genre do you find most into these days.
I am really enjoying some rap currently.
Cool, anyone in particular?
Well I have been checking out some lesser known artist these days.
Like who specifically?
This one kid, Munch.
Any tracks I would know?
I doubt it. He has one song I am loving called simple.
You are right I have no clue. Where is he from?
He is from detroit. Actually a white boy.
Surprising but then there is eminen.
He is also from detroit. Maybe he will rise up in fame too.
Well marshall mathers was huge. Loved 8 mile.
That was a great film and had that one great track.
I think you mean Loose yourself.
Yes those lyrics are so motivating.
Also very true for life. You only get one chance...
He was really a great artist. Kind of disappeared from the scene.
Ya he has not come out with anything new in a while.
Probably just enjoying his money now.
