Brave was a good movie.
I liked that the main character was strong.
It had some scary parts with the bear that scared my kids.
Oh really? I guess that could be scary for kids.
It had some funny parts also like the boys.
Yes, her brothers were funny. They were adorable also with their red hair.
It was funny when they turned into bears.
The relationship of Merida with her mom was really believable.
Yes how many mother daughter relationships are similar to that one.
Many of them. Many daughters think their mothers are too bossy.
