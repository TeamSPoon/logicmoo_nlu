Did you ever listen to Weezer?
Wow, I haven't listened to them in years!
So you know who they are?
Of course, I loved Weezer.
They were pretty big when we were in high school.
I know, they were on the radio all the time.
What was your favorite song?
Say It Ain't So.
Yeah, that one is way up there on my list.
So, what's yours?
Hash Pipe.
My brother used to love that one.  It was never one of my favorites back then though.
How could you not love it?
I didn't say I don't like it now.  It has an awesome bass line.
So it grew on you?
Yeah, I guess.  I appreciate it more now.
They aren't really active now are they?
No, I don't think so.
I'm glad they had a bunch of hits back in the day then.
Yeah, I could listen to them right now.
