Are you excited for the NFL season to start?
I am and pre-season should be starting soon thankfully.
What do you think of the Patriots?
I must admit, I am not a fan of the Patriots.
Even if you don't like them, you have to respect the team.
The patriots are a dirty team, both the head coach and quaterback have been involved in shady dealings.
Yes, I remember Tom and the infamous deflate-gate scandal.
Well the head coach Bill isn't a saint either.
Bill was known for the infamous spy-gate and stealing plays.
Even though they have won more super bowls than any other team, they will always have a black cloud over them.
How many super bowls has the Patriots won again?
Tom Brady has won 5 super bowls, more than any other player.
Wow, he has a ring for every finger on one hand.
As incredible as it sounds, Tom and Bill have always been known for their dirty tactics.
It is hard to respect a team that stoops to dirty tactics.
Well, despite how you feel towards the team, they have accomplished a lot.
Your right, starting in 2002, Tom Brady and the Patriots have racked up some super bowl rings.
I can't imagine there ever being a more dominant team in the NFL.
I can't either and Brady is coming back for another season.
Brady and Bill playing together is a great combination for a win, I am betting on them this year to win it all.
