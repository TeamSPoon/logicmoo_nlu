What's your favorite movie ever?
That's such a tough question!
Just pick one that makes you think a lot!
I'd say the Truman show
Is that the one with Jim Carrey?
Yeah, he's the star of a TV show that he doesn't know he is in!
Yeah, it really makes you think about the show for like a month!
I've heard people start to wonder if they are in a TV show!
Yeah, it messes with your mind more than Inception.
Did you like Inception?
It was pretty confusion for me
Yeah that's how it is for everyone
Yeah, but for me I was recovering from getting my wisdom teeth out so I wasn't thinking clearly anyway
Wow, I cant even imagine that
Yeah, watched a lot of confusing movies when I was recovering
What else did you watch?
I watched Primer, that was a mistake. Way too confusing.
I dont even understand 1% of that movie!
I also watched the Butterfly Effect
Oh that's a good one, I've heard. I'll watch a trailer now!
