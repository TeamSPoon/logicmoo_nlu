Do you like the Dallas Cowboys?
No, not at all.
I don't get why they are always talked about.
I get it, but I don't like it.
What's the reason why they are always in the national media?
Well they are called America's Team, but it's really just about money.
Ah, so they are the team that the league wants to push on people.
Exactly, and their fan base is somewhat large, so it makes sense to give them a lot of attention.
Yeah, I heard that their ticket and merchandise sales are high compared to small market teams.
That may be true, but they haven't fielded a championship team in a long time.
So they are mostly hype?
Yes, and that's what makes people mad about all the media coverage they get.
So it's all style, and no substance.
Yes, but I guess that's half of the reason why anyone gets attention in this world.
So do the Cowboys have any good players?
Their running back Ezekiel Elliott is good, but he was only a rookie last year.
How's their quarterback situation?
Dak Prescott had a solid year last season too, but he was a rookie just like Elliott.
So it's anybody's guess if they can continue their success this year?
That's the question, and usually players have a sophomore slump in their second season.
