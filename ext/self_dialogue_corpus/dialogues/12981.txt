Did you like the Emperor from Star Wars?
Yes, he was one bad dude
Yeah, all the lightning bolts out of his hands
Crazy weapon. Almost unstoppable.
Until Darth Vader threw him down the big hole
Yeah, that was a pretty wicked demise
Wasn't he a Senator at one point.
Right, until the dark side got him
All people can turn bad I suppose
Right, except for Yoda
