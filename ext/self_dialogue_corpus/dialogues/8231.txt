You know Brandon Flowers from The Killers?
Yeah I do why?
He put out a pop album called The Desired Effect.
Whoa why have I not heard of this?
It's absolutely amazing, on par with his stuff in The Killers.
I've been needing more Brandon Flowers in my life so point me in its direction.
You can listen to it on Spotify.
Any standout tracks I should keep my eyes open for?
Between Me and You is a standout.
I will keep my ears open for that one thanks.
