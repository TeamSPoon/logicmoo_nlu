Hey man, what do you think of all these new rappers?
I don't know man, I'm a fan of I guess "classic" rap.
So you don't listen to Lil Yachty or Kodak Black or X?
Dude, I almost didn't know you were saying names just now.
Haha, they're really not bad man you should give them a listen.
Well, I mean I'm into like Chance and Yung Thug and Vic Mensa, a bit of Travi$ Scott.
Yeah, yeah, I feel that I got them on rotation.
Yeah man, but I don't know about those other guys.
Hey man they may dress different and have a slightly different sound than what you call classic rap, but they're good in their own rite, and even when compared.
I don't not believe you man but I get uncomfortable when they dress all hella tight clothes.
Naw, man, that doesn't matter that they dress with tight clothes, they got banging beats, top notch production, sound you haven't heard before.
Maybe they do man, I don't know, I may give them a try.
If you're willing I can put a couple song on right now?
I mean I guess, just don't put on that "all my friends are dead song."
Hahahaha, sure thing man. You listen to Migos?
Not much.
Let me put on some X for you.
Who's that?
He's XXXtentacion, based outta Florida. Ima put on Bowser then What In XXXtarnation.
Hah, already man let's listen to this.
