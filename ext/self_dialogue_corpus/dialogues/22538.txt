What's your favorite Steven King movie?
Oh gosh, that's a really tough decision.  I liked all of them.
Me too, but you have to have had a favorite!
Probably the Shining.  That movie really scared me.
Oh yeah, that movie was terrifying!  Jack Nicholson was fantastic.
I know, and just that creepy hotel.  It was so well done.
Yeah, That came out back in 1980 didn't it?
Yes it's been awhile.  I think his best movies came out in that time period.
Yeah most definitely.  I thought Pet Semetary was great too.
Really? I didn't like that one as much.
Why not?
It didn't really scare me, but I thought Carrie was scary.
See I'm the opposite.  I didn't think Carrie was scary but Pet Semetary spooked me out.
Carrie was just downright creepy!  The scene with the blood and all that gave me shivers.
I thought it was kinda silly.
Well there was definitely nothing silly about the Shining.
Oh no.  I couldn't sleep for weeks after seeing that movie.
Especially the scene with the elevator and the little girls.
Yes that one still kinda haunts me.
I always feel weird in hotels.
