What are you going to be for halloween this year?
You know I havent really thought of it yet. You have an ideas?
Totally. You an 80s action fan?
I'm not NOT a fan, whats on your mind?
Two words. Kurt Russell.
A true hero, but what character?
Could there be anyone better? Snake plissken!
Oh man, I haven't seen escape from new york in years.
One of the truly great films. So campy, and so good.
Didn't they make a sequel?
We don't talk about escape from LA.
That bad, huh?
It wasn't one of his finer moments.
But still, it was kurt, right?
Yeah, he was still snake plissken, but it was awful.
So I guess I dont need to watch it for reference do I?
No way, stick to the original great.
Guess I should start getting my costume together.
Yeah, you've only got 5 months!
I'm on it! But first, I have a movie to watch.
