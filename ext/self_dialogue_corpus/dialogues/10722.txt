I like the first Fast & Furious movie because I loved that classic car.
Yes that is awesome.
Dom was afraid to drive it but did that car was pretty fast.
Yes I wish I could drive that car.
You like Vin Diesel?
Yes he is pretty cool.
You don't see many actors that are in most of the series of movies.
No and he is in the new one. The Rock is also in the new one.
I like The Rock too.
I used to watch him back when he wrestled I guess that was the 90's.
