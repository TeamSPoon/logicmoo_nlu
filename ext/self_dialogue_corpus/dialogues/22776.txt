I'm looking for a good horror movie.
Try Barbadook.  That's a low budget film that will scare you.
Sweet, what's it about?
This woman is widowed and has a bit of a problem child and has to deal with her grief.  But grief manifest as the monster.
Sounds good.  Anything else?
American Ghost Story if you're looking low budget still.
What if I want to little more polish?
Try the original Evil Dead, or Rec.
What's Rec about.
Basically it's Quarantine.  But the original Spanish version.
I heard about that.  I heard it was scary.
It is, definelty need to see it.
I plan to.  That's on my short list.
You have any for me?
Pontypool was good.  It's a different take on zombies.
I saw that.  Any funny ones?
Fido, that was a really fun one.
I saw that was on Hulu but I didn't watch it.
Do it.  It's really funny and has a good plot.
Will do, can't wait to get home.
