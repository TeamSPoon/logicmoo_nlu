The preseason starts soon!
Yeah!  I can't wait!
Who looks good to you this year?
Patriots always look good.
Unfortunately you are correct.
"Unfortunately?"  Why do you say, "Unfortunately?"
I'm a Jets fan.
That is unfortunate!
Ha ha funny boy.  Who do you want this season to go all the way?
I think the Seahawks are going to make a come-back!
I can't stand the Seahawks!
Why?
It's the whole "12th Man" controversy.
What is that?
They stole the slogan from Texas A&M.  It dates back to when A&M was one player short, and one of the fans came out of the stands to take a spot on the field with the team.
That's awesome!
Yeah, and everyone that has every been a Texas A&M student or Alumni member knows about this story. It is a tradition that dates back long before the Seahawks were even a team!
That's so cool!
And the Seahawks have stole this slogan and tried to make it their own! I can't respect a team that would do that
This from a man who says that his own personal theme song is the 007 theme song?  I think you need to get over it!
