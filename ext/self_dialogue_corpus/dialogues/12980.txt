Who is the most evil person in Star Wars?
I'd say it's between The Emperor or Darth Vader
Who is more evil between those two?
The Emperor because he likes to corrupt people
And Vader isn't that bad?
No, not at the end of his life. He does some good things
How does the Emperor corrupt people?
He offers them power and that makes some Jedi go bad
That's what happened to Anakin too, right?
Yeah, he wanted the power he needed to revenge Padme's death!
