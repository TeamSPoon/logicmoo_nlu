Strangers on a Train is definitely my favorite Alfred Hitchcock films.
I don't believe I've heard of that one.
You haven't? You need to check it out. It's very good.
I will. You haven't asked me which Hitchcock film I liked the best.
I can guess. Psycho, right?
Wrong. Rear Window.
Oh, good choice. That's my second favorite.
Psycho's my second favorite Hitchcock film.
I think you'll change your mine after you watch Strangers on a Train with me.
I doubt that.
