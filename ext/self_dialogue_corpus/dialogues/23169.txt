Did you see the simpsons movie?
Yes it was an okay movie
I agree
It was very stupid
Just like the show
Exactly
And flanders and bart bonding was wierd
And completely unrealistic
Exactly
Bart hates him
He would never idolize him in the show
Nope not at all
Lisa was the same as always
Except she had a boyfriend
Thats true
Its about time
And what cant marge put in her hair
I cant believe she put her wedding video in there
Me either
Its crazy
