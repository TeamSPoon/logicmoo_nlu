I hope Rey isn't related to Luke or Han or Leia, like it was rumored.
Why do you say that?
Because it feels like everything that happens in Star Wars revolves around those three.
So you'd like to see more original characters?
Yes. I'd like to at least have them acknowledge there are more than three people in the setting who do anything.
In Rogue One, all of the characters were new.
Rogue One was a really refreshing movie because of that.
It was depressing, though. They all died in the end!
They sacrificed themselves for the Rebellion - as do many in the original movies.
That's true. It served a wonderful thematic purpose.
