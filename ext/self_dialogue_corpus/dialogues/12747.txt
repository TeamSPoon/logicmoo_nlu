Did you see The Return of the Jedi?
Yes, it was Great.
I liked that Darth Vadar was redeemed in the end.
Wasn't it a shock to find out that he was both Leia and Luke's father?
But now that Luke and Leia know they are siblings, and have family, since the rest died.
Of course, Leia also has Han.
Now Han can really be a big bother to Luke.
Do you think Han will be a good father, or still be that brash guy?
Leia should be a calming influence on him.
I bet the kids will be a handful
