Have you seen the trailer for the movie It?
Yes. Please don't remind me!
Why? Don't you like Stephen King?
I do. The problem is that it reminds me of how terrifying clowns can be.
Oh, I know what you mean. How about when it runs through the water?
You're not helping!
I'm sorry. I know lots of people are terrified by Pennywise.
I hope it has an R rating. It really can be too scary for kids.
True. The previous version came out all the way back when we were kids, and it was terrifying.
There sure have been a lot of Stephen King movie adaptations over the years.
Have there? What are some examples?
Oh, that's easy. There's Cell, Carrie and Children of the Corn, just to name a few.
I thought Carrie and Children of the Corn came out a very long time ago.
They made new ones in 2011 and 2013.
Were they remakes?
Carrie was a remake in 2013. Children of the Corn was a sequel in 2011.
Were they any good?
Carrie got mixed reviews. I'm not sure about Children of the Corn.
Have you seen Carrie?
I did. It was okay.
