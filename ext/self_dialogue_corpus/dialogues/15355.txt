Highway to Hell is pretty amazing too. That track rocks!

I do not. Where?
AC/DC is from Australia.
Wow, I did not know that. I always assumed they were from England.
Nope! They are from Australia and one of the most popular bands to ever come from there.
They were formed in 1973, right?
Yup! Malcom & Angus Young formed the band together.
Do you know the song Thunderstruck by AC/DC?
Of course I do! It is an incredibly famous song.
I love the guitar part in that track. It is such a classic riff.
Tell me about it. That band has created a ton of classic riffs and famous songs.
They must be incredibly rich.
I am sure they are! I am sure they have made enough money from their music that they are all millionaires.
