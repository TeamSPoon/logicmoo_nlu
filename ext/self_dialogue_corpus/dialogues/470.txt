Who is your favorite nfl wide quarterback?
Probably Tom Brady.
Yeah, he is probably the best out there right now.
Aron Rodgers is really good too.
Yeah, for sure. He is great too.
I don't really like the Packers though.
Yeah, same, I don't either, they have beat us a few times haha.
Yeah, same lol.
I think the Ravens messed up by paying Joe Flacco so much.
Big time. Since they gave him all that cash the team hasn't been able to keep talent.
Yep, too much for him.
Agreed.
I bet the 49ers are going to be better this year than last.
You think?
Yeah, I bet Shanahan does a nice job there of turning them around.
Could be.
They need one more Super Bowl.
Another would be cool for them.
Maybe in the next couple of years.
Maybe.
