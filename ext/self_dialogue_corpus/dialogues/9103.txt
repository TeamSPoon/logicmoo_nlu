Do you like Bon Jovi?
I really liked their stuff from the 80s through the 90s?
Did you like It's My Life?
The song itself wasn't bad for the time it was released, but I really didn't like the album.
Did you like any of their music after that?
Not really.  They were so good in the eighties, but that was a different time.
I understand what you mean.  It was like two different genres.
Exactly.
What was your favorite song by them?
There are so many of them.   I really like Blaze of Glory and Dead or Alive though.
