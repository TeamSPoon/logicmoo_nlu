I heard that Huey Lewis and the News are doing an 80''s cruise!
No way!! We have to go!
Can you even imagine being surrounded by his music on a fun cruise?
It would be a dream come true.
Who else will be playing?
I'm not sure, I have to check, but even if it was just Huey it would be enough.
I agree! I can't wait.
Remember when our dance class performed his song Power of Love?
Yes! That's all I think about when I hear it. I still remember the moves.
Me too! We will have to do them on the cruise.
Haha. He has so many feel good songs.
I know, I love listening to But It's Alright, Back in Time, If This Is It, and so many more,
I know. They always make me think of his funny music videos too.
The best! When MTV played music.
Yes, my childhood was so good with MTV.
I couldn't agree more. The excitement of waiting for your favorite video was something else.
And Huey videos were always up there with the best.
How have we not seen him live before now?
I don't know, but that's about to change.
I cant wait!
