Who's watching the NBA Playoffs?
I am. Let's hurry up and get to the conference finals.
Who do you like?
Golden State will take it easily.
What about the East?
That's a little more up for grabs. Boston could give Cleveland a run.
You think the Celtics can beat the Cavs?
I think they can be competitive, you never know.
Lebron will smash them.
Maybe, maybe not. It could get interesting.
Do you think the Rockets can put up a fight if they play Golden State?
Harden is good, but c'mon. I'd be shocked if if Golden State didn't win it all.
I think the Rockets can beat them if things go right.
If you feel that way you should bet on Rockets. That'd be a nice return.
I'm not betting on the Rockets. I just think they can make it more interesting than people make it out to be.
If it's GS vs. Houston, how many games do you think Rockets win in that series?
I think they can win a home game at least. Maybe another one or two.
So overall how do you see the Finals shaping up?
Warriors vs. Cavs, Golden State in 6.
Agreed.
