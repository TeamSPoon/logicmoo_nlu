How much longer is this gonna take?
What is?
The tickets for the Pats vs Giants game!
Could be an hour, maybe two!
Okay, I'm tired of waiting!
Why, man? WE WAITED SO LONG FOR THIS MOMENT
WELL, I AIN'T WASTING MY MONEY IF I DON'T GET ANY GOOD, DARN SERVICE HERE!
Dude, stop overreacting!
AGHHHHH!!! I want to get in the stadium already!
Dude, you're going to cause a fuss!
Who cares? I want to get in!
You're acting like a little 5 year old boy, who's excited to see the Giants!
Nahhh, man!
Then why are you complaining?
Cause I wanna see Brady, man!
Why him?
Because he's so cool!
Fine, man! But will you quit complaining?
YESS! I will!
Good, now be quiet, before someone calls the cops on us!
