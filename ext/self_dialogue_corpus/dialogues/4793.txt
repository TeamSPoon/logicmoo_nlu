Did you hear about the baseball umpire getting cheered in Philadelphia?
What? Baseball umpires never get cheered. No matter what they do, they always make somebody mad!
Not this time! He became the hero of the game!
What happened?
This fan was yelling rude remarks at the Giants. I mean, really rude remarks, obscene remarks.
I hate it what some jerk makes you embarrassed that you brought your kid to the game!
Apparently this umpire hates it too.
What did he do?
He had the fan ejected from the game!
Wait, he had a fan ejected? I didn't even know they could do that!
Well he did. Security escorted the loud-mouthed jerk out.
That's awesome.
The whole crowd loved it. Everybody cheered on the umpire!
That has got to be a first in baseball!
I know, usually umpires are pretty much despised.
I hope he gets admitted to the umpire hall of fame.
I'm pretty sure there isn't an umpire hall of fame.
Well there should be one, just dedicated to this one guy.
What if it started a trend of people actually appreciating umpires and cheering them on for good call?
That would be just crazy.
