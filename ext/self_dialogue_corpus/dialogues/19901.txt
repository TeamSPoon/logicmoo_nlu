What happened to Limp Bizkit?
They were part of that terrible rap rock revolution.
Yeah but bands like Korn and Linkin Park are still surviving
I would not say they are surviving.
How about still making music?
I think they still make music even though it may be terrible.
I dont know, havent heard from them.
Rap rock was terrible.
Alot of the themes were horrid.
I think so.
What would you say is the problem with why they didnt survive?
The stuff they talked about was weak.
Isnt it the same stuff rappers talk about?
Yeah but street cred is a bit different.
So because they were white it wasnt accepted?
Yes exactly.
That seems unfair
It is, but its the way the game goes.
I think it should have been reevaluated
For what? Its music. Not that big of a deal
