Hey, whatcha listening too?
It's this band called the Wild Reeds.
Wild Reeds? Never heard of them
They're a great bluegrass/folk group.
That doesn't sound my usual speed.
Just take a listen.
Okay...Hey, this is really good.
Told ya!
What's this song called?
Where I'm Going. It's off their album Blind and Brave.
I really like this. How come I've never heard of them?
They're really fresh, and they only have a small following.
How many albums do they have?
Three! The Blind and Brave, Best Wishes and The World We Built.
This is just such a cool sound.
It's like punk folk right?
What instruments do they use?
Like a guitar, a banjo, an accordion type thing. Really off the wall.
We should go to a concert some time!
Yeah!! And quick before they become too popular.
