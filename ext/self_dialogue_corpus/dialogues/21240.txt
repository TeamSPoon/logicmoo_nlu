Have you been to the movie theater lately?
The last movie I saw was lego batman
Was it good?
Yes it was a great family movie.
I just saw Boss Baby, it was cute.
My kinds have been wanting to see it.
My favorite movie that has been released lately is Suicide Squad.
That's a good movie, I've watched it about three times.
It never gets old, I can't wait til the second one.
Me either, I'm not sure when it's coming out though.
Did you see Beauty and the Beast?
Not yet, I've been wanting too
Me either, I heard it was really good
I've been meaning to check redox and see if it's there yet.
I want to go see the Rings, see what makes it different from the first movie
I saw it, it's not that great.
Maybe I won't watch it then, the first one wasn't that good.
I didn't know they were planning on coming out with a new one.
Me either, just trying to make money.
I agree with that
