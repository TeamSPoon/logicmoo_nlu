Have you seen the recent trend of Disney doing live-action remakes of their animated classics?
Yeah, I think so. Aren't they coming out with a new Beauty and the Beast remake?
Yup, it's going to star Emily Watson!
Um, you're thinking of Emma Watson. The girl who played Hermione in the Harry Potter movies.
Oh yea, that's right. So, do you think it's going to be any good?
Disney tends to have a decent track record with these things. Even if it's not better than the original, it probably won't be horrible.
Indeed, I heard they are keeping it pretty faithful to the original, even the promotional materials show Watson's Belle in that classic yellow dress.
I wouldn't know, I never actually watched the original.
You're kidding me right?
No, I was like only two years old when the original came out and my parents never bought me the tapes or DVDs when I was a kid.
