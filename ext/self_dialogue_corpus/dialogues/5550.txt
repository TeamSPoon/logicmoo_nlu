What is the name of that Disney movie with the Elephant?
Do you mean Dumbo?
Yes, that's the one.  Have you seen it?
Seen it? It's my favourite Disney movie of all time!
I love the way Dumbo eventually flies and proves all the other elephant wrong.
It is sad though that he isn't with his mother at the beginning.
Yes it is but he does have Timothy Mouse.
That movie was made in 1941!
Really? It has stood the test of time though... it's an all time classic.
Totally agree. Disney sure now how to write them.
