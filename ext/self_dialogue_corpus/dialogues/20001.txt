What do you think of classical music?
I like some stuff, but most of it just sounds the same.
What have you heard?
Just the big songs you hear in movies and commercials.
Ah there's much more than those to listen to, those are just the well known ones.
Do you know any other songs that aren't as popular?
I can't think of their names sadly, but I've heard a lot more than those popular few, that's for sure.
What kinds of instruments do they use?
Well the really popular stuff is mainly piano or at least performed on piano.
I though most classical music was on piano.
You might be right, I'm not sure.
They've got some orchestral music though too right?
Yeah there's a lot that is written for an orchestra.
Do you know any groups that play classical music?
Not off the top of my head, but I like to play some.
Oh, really? What do you play?
Just a few small pieces, but nothing really from the classical era. A lot of newer bands have classical sounding pieces in some of their songs.
That's pretty cool.
Yeah, I know that King Diamond has a heavy classical influence, and they mainly do scary metal.
Oh, very strange. I'm sure some of my bands have classical influences too.
