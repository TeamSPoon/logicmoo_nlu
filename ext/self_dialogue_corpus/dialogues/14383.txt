Did you hear the Lakers fired Mitch Kupchak?
Yeah, but Magic Johnson was named president so that is pretty cool.
I'm a huge fan of Magic Johnson.
Did you know that he was inducted in the basketball hall of fame twice?
At one point he was named the greatest point guard in the NBA.
I think Eric Bledsoe was really on fire.
Yeah it was a shame that he's having to sit out the rest of the season because of his knees.
My best friend was a great basketball player in high school but he messed up his knees too.
Was he a point guard?
Yeah, he was pretty good and was probably going to get a scholarship.
I think Kemba Walker has really been doing well.
Did you see the game with the Nuggets?
On ESPN they said he reached 8,000 career points so far in that game.
The Hornets were really lucky to get him for sure.
What else can you expect of a team owned by Michael Jordan?
I know, the man is a legend.
Did you catch the game between the Warriors and the Spurs last night?
Yeah, at first I thought it was going to be close but the Warriors pulled it out.
I got season tickets last year and I never missed a game.
We should go see a game next weekend.
