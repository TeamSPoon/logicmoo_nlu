Hey, what's your favorite song of all time?
Gosh, what a hard choice!  There are so many good ones.
Yeah, it's hard to pick.  I think mine would be The Righteous Brothers, Unchained Melody.
Oh that's a beautiful song!  I love that one too.
Yeah, it almost brings me to tears when I hear it.
Wasn't it in that movie Ghost?
Yeah it was.
Did they ever have any other famous songs?
Yeah, they did but nothing that was as successful as that one.
What was some of their other music?
Well You've Lost That Loving Feeling would probably be the one you've heard of.
Oh yeah, that one is amazing too.
Yeah.  They were a duo, although initially they were in a band called the Paramours.
I think I've heard of that band.
You might have.  They were from Los Angeles.
I'm sure they had a great sound, too.
Yeah.  But Hatfield and Medley broke out and formed the Righteous Brothers.
I guess that was a good thing for them!  They sure had success with their singles.
Yeah they did.  In 2016, Medley started up another duo and is still recording.
Wow, that's hard to believe.
