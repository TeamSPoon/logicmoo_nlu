Have you seen the movie Wall-E?
Yes! I love that movie. Why do you ask?
Because I think I'm getting a bit too large just like the people in that movie.
Haha. No you're not.
You don't think so?
No, I don't think anybody could be as lazy as those people in that movie.
Well I do like to sit in my chair a lot and watch Disney movies! Haha.
But that's okay because Disney movies are great.
Yeah I guess, and Wall-E is one of them.
Maybe you can do some jumping jacks the next time you watch it or something.
