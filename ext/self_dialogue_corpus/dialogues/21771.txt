Ah it's movie night tonight.My husband and I take turns picking the genre.
So who's turn is it tonight? Who is in control of the remote?
That would be MEEEEE! Yesssss! So what am I going to pick.
What do you feel up for. Comedy? Sci Fi?
So hard to choose but you know I am going to be nice to my husband and go for comedy. But it's going to be something I can handle.
And who are you going to choose? Old school comedy or more recent?
I am going with old school. Mel Brooks is going to be the purveyor of our snickers tonight.
Oh great so pretty much you are going to act like juvenile delinquents in your choice of humor. He did put out some funny stuff.
You would not be far from wrong on that assumption! We just recently watched Blazing Saddles.
Oh yeah the classic campfire fart scene is always sure to get you going! Cleavon Little as the black sheriff is a hoot.
Yes there are so many famous actors and oh yeah "that guy" moments. Madeline Kahn just blows me away with her characters.
Oh her song (I'm so tired) and how she sings it is priceless. She hits a home run every time!
Here's something you may not know about the movie. Mel Brooks ask John Wayne to be in the movie but he turned it down.
Why do you think he did that? Was it beneath his stature in life to do that level of crassness in a movie?
He was quoted as saying "Naw, I can't do a movie like that, but I'll be first in line to see it!" That was pretty funny.
Well I guess for the kind of actor he was he had a n image to uphold. His fans may have not liked that coming from "the Duke".
Their loss I say. It could have been pretty hilarious.
Hey he still would have been playing a cowboy. But I guess the purists would have freaked out if he racist jokes.
Well wish me luck on my second choice. Should it be Princess Bride or Young Frankenstein?
I guess it depends if you want to watch a second one with Wilder and Kahn. Maybe go with Princess Bride.
