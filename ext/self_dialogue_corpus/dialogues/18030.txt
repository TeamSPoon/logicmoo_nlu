I've noticed 90s-style pop music coming back.
I've heard that to- a lot of beats and thing I recognize from my childhood.
Do you remember your favorite albums from then?
I know I played that Alanis Morrisette album to death.
'Jagged Little Pill'?
Yes! The songs on that were everywhere for a year or so in the 90s.
It was a great pop/rock radio album, for sure.
I remember Shania Twain being everywhere, too.
Of course! Whatever happened to her?
I have no idea, but she was huge in the 90s.
Same with Celine Dion. Especially with the Titanic theme.
I think that might have broken a record for the most consecutive weeks at #1.
It wouldn't surprise me. I feel like I've seen the music video a thousand times.
That reminds me of MTV's TRL! That defined pop music of the whole decade.
Completely - if you weren't on TRL, you hadn't made it.
Me and my friends would all tune in to see what was at the top. It was a real cultural phenomenon.
Incredible to think how the internet has replaced even those aspects of the music industry.
Do you think it's better for it?
I'm not sure. I think there's more variety in music right now than there has been in a long time.
Agreed - the internet cuts out the record company middle man, which helps explore creativity in music.
