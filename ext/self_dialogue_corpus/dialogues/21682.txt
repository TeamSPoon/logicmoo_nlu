I just saw Kong: Skull Island.
I haven't seen it yet. What did you think?
It was great! I loved the action, and the cinematography.
Was it very different from other Kong movies?
Yes and no. It expands on Kong's history, his family, and where he comes from.
What's different about it?
It adds a kind of "Journey to the Center of the Earth" twist.
Looks more like a Vietnam War film.
Yeah, it takes place in that era. Great soundtrack too!
Who's in it?
Samuel L. Jackson, Tom Kiddleston, John Goodman, John C. Reilly
Good actors! I love Samuel L. Jackson.
The whole cast was superb.
Do you think there will be another Kong after this?
Definitely. There's already a sequel planned.
What's the sequel going to be about?
No spoilers! But it will follow on the new "twist" I spoke of.
Would you like to go see it with me?
Yeah, I'd see it again!
Let's go!
