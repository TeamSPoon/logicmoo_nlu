Who are your favorite singers from American Idol?
Oh, I have so many.
Me too. I really like Kelly Clarkson.
Yes, her win on American Idol Season 1 is a classic tale.
But seriously, a lot of her music is great.
I really like Breakaway, Since You've Been Gone....
I think Walk Away is a classic.
Yes! Another person I like is Bo Bice.
Wasn't he the runner up of season 4?
Yep, he lost to Carrie Underwood.
She has great music too, Before He Cheats is amazing.
Yep! Bo Bice is a rocker though.
I've never heard his stuff after American Idol.
It's very rock and roll, his album was The Real Thing.
I'll have to listen to it.
Yep, another rocker was Chris Daughtery.
I rememer his elimination so well!
His music is great.
Yeah, I know which album you're talking about.
American Idol produced a LOT of good artists.
