Modest Mouse's "Rock the boat" is a great indie rock tune.
Are they really indie rock.
OK maybe just rock?
Yeah I think it was pretty good in its day.
So what do you think they are doing now?
Still making music but nothing huge.
They came in with a bunch of Seattle bands
They have been making music way more than that and much longer.
It was a great blend of drumming and guitars
Thats the most important element of a good rock song.
