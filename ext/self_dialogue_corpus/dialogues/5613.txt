Hey have you watched Dumbo lately?
Wow, that's really an old one!  No, it's been awhile.
I still love it.  I watched it with my kids the other day.
I never understood the part with the pink elephants.
Oh, it's simple!  Dumbo and the mouse get drunk and start hallucinating.
That seems kinda weird for a kid's movie.
Yeah, there are some really inappropriate things in the movie.  Fortunately I don't think the kids really notice.
Well, it's a sweet story either way.
It really is.  The part where the mother sings Baby Mine is so sweet.
I know!  I still sing that to my children.
