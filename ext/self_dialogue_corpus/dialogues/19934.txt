Do you like Katy Perry?
Love her!! I have seen her in concert, too.
Seriously? I haven't but would love to.
She's awesome in concert. Really fun and interactive with the audience.
Do you have any of her albums?
I have them all. "Prism" is my favorite.
That's a great album. She did awesome when she performed at the Super Bowl.
I loved when she came in riding the giant tiger!
"California Girls" with Snoop Dogg is a great song, and the video is awesome.
She really made it look like candy land, and the costumes were awesome.
And "Last Friday Night" is a great song.
Yes! That video was awesome, too!
She just goes above and beyond for her songs and music videos.
"Last Friday Night" was totally 80s. She didn't forget any detail.
I like how the song has a sax solo towards the end.
Did Kenny G really perform that?
I'm not sure. He was in the music video, so I assume so.
Do you like the song, "Dark Horse" by Katy Perry?
I do.
She has such a gorgeous voice!
