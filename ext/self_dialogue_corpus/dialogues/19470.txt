What do you think of Katy Perry?
I don't care much for her early works.
Why not?
Its just too bubble gum , You know lots of color and sweetness that gets old quick.
hahaha good one, never heard it described like that.
I do like some of her work, however.
What are your favorite songs?
I really like "Wide Awake". She wrote it after she and husband Russell Brandt broke up.
I heard he had cheated on her.
He did, he was dianoised with a sex addiction shortly after they married.
That explains the video for that song then.
I thought so. She had lost her innocence of childhood and the believe in fairy tales after her prince destoryed her.
Ok I wondered how the monster in the mirror played in, she had to face the darkness inside herself, but face it with the bravery of a child that had to tell the boogie man to go away!
That is how i  took it.
I like her song "Roar" , have you heard it?
Yes, its ok, a lil too pro feminist for me.
I dont understand...
For me, the song was again too cartoonish, both in lyric and video, for the message it wanted to send.
I think she does that because her audience is typically younger.
I get that, but the whole candy/ acid trip theme is creepy to me.
