Have you heard Rihanna's new song? It just came out.
No, I haven't heard it yet. What's it called?
It's called "Wild Thoughts".
Wild Thoughts?
Yeah, Wild Thoughts.
Let me look it up on Spotify.
It's technically under DJ Khaled's Spotify. It's him, Bryson Tiller, and Rihanna.
Oh okay, let me check that one then.
Yeah, it's pretty good.
I recognize the beat, is it sampling anything?
Yeah, that Carlos Santana song, "Maria, Maria".
Ah yeah, I remember that now.
How are you liking it?
It's great so far. "All I get when I'm with you is Wild Thoughts!"
See I told you.
I believed you, I just had to hear it myself.
Yeah it just came out and I had to let you know. It made me think of you.
I'm so glad you showed me this, it's my new favorite. Thank you!
No problem! Happy to help.
I love this song!
