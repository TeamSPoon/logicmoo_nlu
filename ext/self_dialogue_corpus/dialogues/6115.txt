So, I have got into Disney movies recently.
For the first time?
No, just once again, the first time since I was a kid.
How are you liking the reviewing?
They are all supposed to have like a moral right?
I think so, yes.
Then what is the moral of Frozen?
Friendship, over coming? Sisterhood maybe.
I do not see it. Elsa was just spoiled and angry, she never really over came anything.
She did learn to, let it go.
