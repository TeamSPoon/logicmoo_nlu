Did you believe the CGI in Disney's new The Jungle Book?
It was beautiful! Loved all the animals.
Talking, wild animals.  Nice story too.
I couldn't believe Bill Murray did a voiceover.
Baloo, what a lazy bear.
Shere Khan scared me.
He was pretty fierce, no doubt.
Kaa was a baddie too. Scarlett Johansen I think.
They had a lot of good voice talent.
Its a quality movie.I want to see it on hi-def.
