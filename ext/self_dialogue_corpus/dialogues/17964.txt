What do you think of the script?
The script? I've only listen to few songs by them.
I just recently discovered them! I think I'm in love.
What songs have you listen to so far?
Breakeven speaks to me on some many levels.
That's a great song..One of the few I actually know.
You should try "The man who can't be moved" I have the that song on repeat.
Okay I'll add it to my list! Have you heard Nothing?
No, not yet.
Nothing is a really powerful song. I went through a break up and it was my go to song.
I'll make sure to listen to it. What about Hall of fame? Everytime I need motivation I listen that song.
I could use some motivation right now! I'll have to check it out.
What other songs have you heard?
This=Love is another great song!
Ha ha, for someone who doesn't really know them you're recommending a lot of great songs.
Its seems I liked them more than I thought.
Aren't they from the UK
I think so, Their from Ireland.
This makes me want to look up other UK bands
Let's do it.
