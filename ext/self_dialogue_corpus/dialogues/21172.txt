Are you planning to see the new Wonder Woman movie?
Yes. It looks like it will be really good.
Gal Gadot seems to be a great choice for Wonder Woman.
I agree. I really enjoyed her portrayal in Batman vs. Superman.
Yeah, I really enjoyed that movie as well.
I was a little curious about casting Ben Affleck as Batman but he seemed to play the part well.
I knew he was going to nail it as Bruce Wayne but I wasn't sure how he'd handle the role of Batman either.
I'm excited to see more of him in the Justice League movie. That comes out pretty soon as well.
I look forward to them introducing some more of the DC characters to their cinematic universe.
Yeah. The Wonder Woman movie will be a great start to kicking off solo movies for more of the Justice League characters.
I've heard they're going to work on a stand alone Flash movie as well; and possibly a Batgirl flick.
That would be great. Clearly, they have Ezra Miller to play the Flash, but I wonder who they'll cast as Batgirl.
I don't know. I haven't heard any rumors about that yet. I think it's probably still too early.
Yeah, it'll be interesting to see how many of these movies actually see the light of day.
I would imagine quite a few of them. Warner Brothers and DC stand to make a ton of money in releasing them, assuming they're done well.
Yeah, there sure are a lot of comic book fans out there looking for these types of movies and willing to shell out their money to see them.
Speaking of which, are you going to try and see Wonder Woman opening night?
No, I'll probably wait a few days so I can go when the theater is less crowded.
That's probably what I'll do too. It's a little nicer when you don't have to share the theater with a ton of people.
I totally agree.
