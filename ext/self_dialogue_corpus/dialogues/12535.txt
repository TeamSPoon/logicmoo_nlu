What is your favorite Star Wars Movie?
I like the third episode the best.
The third episode of the originals or the prequels?
The prequels, Revenge of the Sith.
What makes that movie so special to you?
I really enjoy watching Anakin Skywalker transform into Darth Vader.
Did you know he would eventually become Darth Vader?
As a kid I liked Anakin because I could relate to him as a kid, I never realized he would become Darth Vader though.
Does watching the prequels before the original movies make you feel any different about the originals?
No, I really the whole series, the new ones however are a little less interesting to me. They seem to lack a strong theme.
