What is your favorite Will Ferrell movie?
No question, Anchorman.
Not Step Brothers?
Don't get me wrong, Step Brothers was great. However, Anchorman is way more quotable.
I think that my problem with Anchorman was that he basically copied the same character for many of his subsequent movies like Talladega Nights and Blades of Glory.
Please explain.
You know, the arrogant dumb guy who excels at an eccentric profession.
True, but at least he's great at that role. I bet that tons of actors wish they could do that.
Yeah. Zach Galifianakis tries to do his Alan character from the Hangover in other movies like Due Date, but it always falls flat.
Yeah, I'd say that the Hangover is the only good Zach Galifianakis movie.
I hope you just mean the first Hangover movie and not the franchise as a whole.
I definitely think that the first one was far and away the best one. However, the second one unfairly receives a bad reputation.
The Hangover Part II was essentially a direct copy of the first one, except it took place in Thailand.
Yeah, but it was still really funny.
Agree to disagree. However, I think that we can both say that the Hangover Part III was terrible though.
No argument here. That one was definitely trying to build off of the nostalgia from the first one. Also, I found  Melissa McCarthy's character annoying and not funny.
I wouldn't say that it was her best role, but I think that you're being too harsh on her.
I love Melissa McCarthy and think that her role in Bridesmaids is one of the best comedic performances of this decade. I just found her to be terrible in the Hangover Part III.
That's fair, although I felt that Melissa McCarthy received too much credit for her performance in Bridesmaids, which overshadowed my favorite part of the movie, Kristen Wiig.
She was also good in Bridesmaids. Too bad she hasn't had another hit movie since.
