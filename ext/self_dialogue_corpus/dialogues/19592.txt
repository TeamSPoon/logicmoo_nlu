Hey, did you go to DC101's Kerfuffle?
No. I liked some of the bands playing, but not others.
What was your favorite band playing?
Weezer. I love the song "Say It Ain't So."
Me too. It's such a catchy tune.
Plus the song "Buddy Holly" has a great music video referencing "Happy Days."
Oh, I know! It's so cool.
Yeah, so I would've gone to the concert, but Kings of Leon was also headlining.
Who's Kings of Leon?
They're this rock band from Nashville.
That sounds cool to me.
Yeah, they're cool in theory, but I find their sound annoying.
What makes it annoying?
The lead vocalist's voice is grating to me.
Oh, that's crazy. I find the lead vocalist of Dave Matthew's Band to be ge grating too.
Yeah, so you understand.
I totally do. Sounds like I won't check out that band.
No, but a good rock band to check out, if you haven't yet, is Imagine Dragons.
Oh yeah? What kind of music do they play?
They're an alternative rock band. They're definitely worth a listen.
