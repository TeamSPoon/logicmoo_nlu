What is your favorite Lady Gaga song?
That's a tough call! New or older Lady Gaga?
How about each?
Well my favorite newer song is Million Reasons!
Did you see her perform it at the Victoria Secret fashion show?
Yes, it was amazing!
What is your favorite older song of hers?
I think I'd have to pick Just Dance. What about you?
I really like that song too! Either that or Poker Face.
Don't forget about the great song Bad Romance!
