Did you like The Force Awakens?
I haven't seen it.
What! Why not you love star wars!!
I LOVED Star Wars. The original first three. The "prequals" sucked.
I don't know, I liked The Phantom Menace.
Of the three prequals The Phantom Menace was the best. The 2nd one was boring and the last one felt rushed.
Rushed how?
I felt like they were in a hurry to wrap up the whole Darth Vader is Luke and Leia's father and then goes to the dark side. Poor story, poor development.
I guess that makes sense, i hadn't thought of it that way.
Sorry to ruin it for you.
