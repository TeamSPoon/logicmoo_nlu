What do you think the new Frozen movie will be about?
What?? New Frozen movie?
Yeah! There's a Frozen sequel that's coming out November 27, 2019.
Really/ Where can I get info about it?
IMDb will probably be helpful. Elsa has the voice voice actor, by the way.
Oh, you mean Idina Menzel. Well, I hope it'll have better songs.
Yes, the so.gs in Frozen were pretty cheesy. Especially "Love is an Open Door".
Yep, that was pretty terrible and corny.
Well, I'm just wondering what the plot line will be.
I hope it isn't about Elsa running away from her problems again.
