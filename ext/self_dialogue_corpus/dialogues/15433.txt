Hey man!  I'm trying to find some new music to work out to, any suggestions?
Well what kind of music are you looking for?
I don't know, I think I'm trying to change it up a little bit.
You've gotta help me out a little bit haha, What do you listen to now?
I've been listening to stuff like Staind and Disturbed.
No wonder you want a change, that stuff is garbage.
I guess, I kind of like it though.
Well, when I go I listen to a lot of rap and metal.  It really gets me pumped up.
I'm open to suggestions. What bands should I put on a playlist?
For rap, I would add some Kendrick, some Future, some Dram, and maybe some old school stuff like Nas.
Alright, I've only heard of Kendrick and Nas, do the other 2 sound like them?
Not really, but it'll be good to change it up, I'm sure you've heard Future before, he does the song that goes "Molly, Percocet."
Alright, yeah I've heard that one before it's pretty catchy.  I don't know if it would get me pumped in the gym though.
I don't know man, it works for me.
What about some of the metal you were talking about?
Oh yeah, it really gets me hyped up.  Have you heard Norma Jean or Bury your dead?
No, but they have cool names.
Oh man, check them out, if they don't get you pumped up, I don't know what will.
Alright, I put a bunch of their songs on a playlist for the gym tonight.
Let me know what you think man!
