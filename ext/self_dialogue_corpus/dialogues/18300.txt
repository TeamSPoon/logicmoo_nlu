Have you heard the new Cloakroom single?
I haven't. Is it any good?
Man. It's beyond awesome!
Does it sound any like their old stuff?
Yeah, it doesn't sound too much different.
That's great because I love their love stuff.
Yeah. It's great atmospheric rock.
Their sound is pretty one of a kind.
Yeah the singer uses a lot of distortion on his pedals as well.
That's what I read. Pretty interesting stuff.
Their music sounds so "big".
Yeah, that's why I love it.
It's like their music has no walls or limits.
Yeah, just like a endless landscape of noise.
I would love to see them live.
Me too. We should do a roadtrip if they come anywhere nearby.
That sounds like a great idea.
Hopefully they tour around here!
That would be a great time.
An amazing time.
