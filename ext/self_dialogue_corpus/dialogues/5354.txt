What was your favourite Disney movie as a kid?
I'd say Aladdin. It was pretty darn cool.
It had a lot going on. Robin Williams as the Genie was just genius.
Completely. It was one of his best roles. He was hilarious.
It had a good villain too. Jafar right?
Yeah, he was scary as hell. Almost too scary for a kid's movie.
But at least he was a villain with some actual threat right?
I suppose. I mostly just wanted my own magic carpet.
Yes! The Carpet was so awesome. It had a ton of personality for a rug.
Exactly. Forget the gold and jewels, just give me the Carpet.
