9 weeks until the season starts.  I'm ready--Sunday tailgates here I come!
I'm right there with you, buddy.
So- what's your team?  Are you still a 49ers fan?
Oh hell no!  They lost me when Harbaugh left and Kaepernick was benched.
Yeah, they really blew that call.  That kid was really responding to Harbaugh.  They needed another coach who knew how to bring him along.  That kid is talented.
Yeah--pisses me off that the league is blackballing him.
Yeah, you gotta give it to that guy, though--he's sticking to his guns.
Yeah  You know who really impresses me is the Raiders QB Derek Carr.  That kid is great man--nothing but upside.
As long as they put an actual line in front of him this year.  That injury was gruesome.  Yo think he'll be ready for training camp?
I don't know.  The way the league tries to rush these guys back from an injury . . . I'm thinking RG3.
Yeah, that was majorly screwed up, man.  I'm pushing for the Steelers, myself.
Well, if Big Ben wants another ring, he'd better hurry.  He's getting a little long in the tooth, and he ALWAYS takes a beating.  Talk about a team that needs an O-line . . .
No kidding.  I know he's had some off-the-field problems in the past, but there's just something about that guy that I like.  You know, local boy, plays close to home.
Yeah, and he's really settled down since he got married and had kids.
What do you think of Green Bay?
I think all they got is Aaron Rodgers.  That's a pretty good "all", but he can't do it alone.
Yeah.  I'm just hoping someone will beat the friggin' Patriots.  That Belichick stinks on ice, man.  Is there any way to cheat that he hasn't thought of?
If there is, I'm sure we'll see it this season.  What a jerk!
Amen to that, Bro.  So, I'm saying Super Bowl--Steelers by 6 over Seattle?
Get outta town!  Raiders by 12 over Arizona!
