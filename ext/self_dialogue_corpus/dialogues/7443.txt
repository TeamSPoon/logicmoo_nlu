hey did you ever watch all the monster inc movies?
there were more than one of them?
yes disney came out with a few others after the first one
no i did not know that there were others, i just saw the first one
well in my opinion that was the best one out of them all
yeah it was a pretty cool story
the disney movies are usually really good at stories
i agree, i liked sully's friend mike the best
yeah he was pretty comedic, let me know if you want to watch the others some time i have them on dvd
oh cool i will definitely let you know about that
