Hi
Hello
How is it going?
Good, you?
Can't complain.
Do you enjoy baseball?
Yeah I do.  Do you like it?
Yeah sure do.  Do you have a team?
I guess I go for the A's from time to time.
Oh?
Yeah I'm not really attached.
They really aren't great these days.
Yeah that's what's tough about going for them.
I understand.
What about you?
I'm a Rays fan.
Oh Florida, interesting.
Yeah really like going to the games.
Good chatting.
Good talking to you.
