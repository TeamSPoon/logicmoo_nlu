I would love for Beck to come out with another album.
Does he have one coming out soon?
I don't know about THAT. I just want him too.
Yeah I like him too.
He's really unique and talented.
I heard he got his start in Los Angeles.
I heard that too. His musical influences came from its diverse street scene.
I enjoy his music. Its a little unusual.
Yes well I guess his ear was influenced by church hymns too.
I see. I'm not sure I picked up on that.
So which of his albums do you like?
Only all of them! I'm serious.
You have all of them?
Every last one. Ever since his music first started coming out.
I have a few, like Sea Change.
Sea Change is exceptionally strong. The critics loved it.
Yeah didn't they call it his best album?
Absolutely. He wrote it after a hard breakup with his partner.
He seems like a hardcore  artist.
I see what you mean. I appreciate his work.
