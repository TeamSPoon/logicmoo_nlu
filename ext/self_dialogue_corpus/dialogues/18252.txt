That's cool.  Have you every heard of Ryan Adams?
Yeah, I think so.
He used to be married to Mandy Moore...
oh yeah, I know who you are talking about.  I don't know many of his songs though.
He didn't really have any mainstream stuff, he had a lot of his songs in that show Felicity with Kerry Russel.
Oh yeah, I know that show.  So he's good?
Yeah, you should check him out.  I really like his music.
Cool, thanks for the recommendation.
No problem.  He has a great song called Rescue Blues, it's one of my favorites.
I'll definitely check it out.
He also did a cover of Taylor Swift's entire 1989 album
