Have you ever seen the thriller Misery before?
When did it come out?
It is a Stephen King thriller from 1990.  I watched it on tv the other day.
Who plays in it?
James Caan and Kathy Bates plays in it.
Is that the one where James Cann's character gets trapped by a crazy woman in a cabin?
Yes, she is nuts, and even breaks his legs to keep him from leaving!
Wow! I think I saw it a while back but it's been so long.
I enjoyed watching  her get what she deserved.
Good!  I am glad of it.
