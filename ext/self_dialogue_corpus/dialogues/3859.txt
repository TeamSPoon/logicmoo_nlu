Hey! I'm really keen to see a thriller movie this week. Is anything playing that you'd recommend?
Hm, well I absolutely loved Atomic Blonde, with Charlize Theron. Have you seen that yet?
No, I haven't! Why'd you like it so much? What's it about?
Theron plays a character called Agent Lorraine Broughton, a British spy during the Cold War. The movie is set just before the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, and Agent Broughton has to team up with a German agent to take on a threat to Western Intelligence.
Sounds really cool, though I'm not much of a history buff. Do you think I'd still enjoy it even if I don't know much about the Cold War?
Oh, definitely. I mean, it's an intelligent movie, based on the graphic novel  The Coldest City, but it's entertainment, not a documentary.
Excellent. Sounds good, and I do love Charlize Theron. Anyone else in the movie who I'd recognize?
Yes! James McAvoy is in it, playing one David Percival, and he's absolutely excellent. Do you like him?
Are you kidding? I LOVE James McAvoy. Okay, I'm sold, I'm going to get a ticket and check this out. Cold War spy thriller, here I come!
Excellent, I hope you enjoy it - let me know! Who knows, you might just wind up a bit more of a history buff, too!
