Hey what are you up to today?
Not much, just listening to some music.
That's cool. I am looking online for a concert to go to.
Cool! Whose concert are you going to?
I'm looking in to going to a Trisha Yearwood concert.
She is good. I have not listened to many of her songs.
Her most famous song was She's In Love With The Boy.
Yeah I really like that song. What are some of her other popular songs?
There is Walk Away Joe, XXX's and OOO's, I Need You, and How Do I Live.
Wasn't How Do I Live a song my LeAnn Rimes.
Well it was originally performed my LeAnn Rimes but then Yearwood redone it.
I really like LeAnn Rimes' version so I will have to give hers a shot to.
She is really great. I'm hopping that Garth Brooks will be at her concert with her.
Why would he be there?
They are married. He is an awesome country singer to.
What are some of his songs, maybe I have heard some of them?
Friends In Low Places, The Dance, Unanswered Prayers, and The Thunder Rolls are some of his most popular songs.
Oh I love Unanswered Prayers. He also had a song called Change that is amazing.
I have never heard that one, I will have to give it a try.
Yeah it is great. If he will be at the concert with her, I will definitely go!
