Did you see the live version of Beauty and the Beast?
Yes I did.
What did you think of it?
I thought it was really well done.
Me too, I was afraid they would mess it up.
I was too, but they kept it really similar to the cartoon version.
I thought the casting was excellent!
Oh, so did I.  Emma Watson was great as Belle.
I hope Disney does more live action movies based off of cartoons.
So do I, they're bringing back my childhood.
