Have you seen Wonder Woman yet.
I have!
What did you think of it?
It was one of the best super hero movies I have ever seen.
I think Gal Gadot really embodies the essence of Wonder Woman.
The part near the end when they go to the ball, she felt like a superhero.
When she pulls the huge sword from the back of her dress?
The "god killer', yes.
It felt like that was her turn, in the film from sheltered Amazonian to strong super woman type.
I think they will keep on going with her in more Wonder Woman films.
I imagine so, it did so well.
It out sold The Mummy, with a better known star, at least in the USA.
I hope Wonder Woman shows up in more DC movies.
I am sure she will. She was the best part of Batman Vs. Superman.
To be fair, she was the only good part.
What did you think of the ending of Wonder Woman?
I cried when he shot the plane down, with him still in it.
But, I think somehow they may bring him back.
How would they manage that?
Well, that bad German scientist was still alive, maybe she saved him, like they did Captain America.
