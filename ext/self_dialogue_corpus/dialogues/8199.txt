I've noticed a dramatic change in pop music.
What's that?
It's a lot more diverse.
I know why. It's because the world is getting smaller.
Yes, we all have access to the music that's popular around the world.
Exactly! I suspect that if a song is popular in one country, it will be popular in another.
Why is that?
I think it's because the human brain likes certain patterns.
And, those patterns are present in pop music?
Yes, most pop songs have a similar structure. It's a structure which is soothing and pleasing.
