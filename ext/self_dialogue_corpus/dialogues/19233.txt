did you like yeezus?
what album was that
the one with black skinhead and new slaves
kanye really spazzed on that album
he talked about a lot of fashion and racism
thats kinda like old kanye
but he also had that bound 2 song
that music video was so weird.
it was cheesy.
people joked about it a lot
kanye probably knew it was cheesy
kanye did.
he just wanted to get people talking
he's become so attuned to controversy
he likes attention i guess.
but he also makes a bit of a statement.
yeah, i would agree.
i hope he does more music
yeah, he is important to rap
most definitely
