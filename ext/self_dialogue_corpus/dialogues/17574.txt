What do you think of Carrie Underwoods album Blown Away?
Dont know much about it.
I really enjoyed it.
What was your favorite song on the album
I think 2 Black Cadaliac would be one of my favorites.
Do you know when that album was released?
I do believe it was in late 2012
I assume Blown Away the song about the abuseive father is one that album
yes you assume correctly also one of my favorites.
didnt she get married to some guy awhile ago
Yes she married Mike Fisher
She has a great voice almost angelic til you hear a few of her songs like When he Cheats
My husband loves that song and he hates country music
My sister use to tell my brother in law thats what would happen to his corvetteif she caught him.
I wonder if she has any tour dates set yet and where they will be.
No i checked last week and there was nothing anywhere for Carrie Underwood.
Thats disappointing Wonder why not
Maybe she just wants to devote time to her family
Yes i do know she is family orianted and cares deeply about her husbands career.
Yes and thats probably why she doesnt have any tour dates set for this year yet.
