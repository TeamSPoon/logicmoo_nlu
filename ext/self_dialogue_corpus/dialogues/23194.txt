Let's talk romantic comedy movies!
For a chick flick movie night?
Yes, like 'When Harry Met Sally' chick flick.
Haha you're so funny. I liked that movie and Meg Ryan.
Nothing can go wrong with Meg Ryan! Even in 'Kate & Leopold.'
Ugh, that movie was so good! I want to watch it again.
What about '10 Things I Hate About You?'
That movie was such a great romantic comedy.  Probably on my top 10 list.
I agree! Heath Ledger and Joseph Gordon-Levitt did fantastic in that movie.
So did Julia Styles! She nailed that part for sure.
I cried at the end!
I can still recite that poem, to this day.
'She's All That' is another great chick flick.
With Freddie Prince Jr.? Um. Yes. 100 percent for sure.
He was such a heart throb back then.
I definitely had a crush on him, and he's talented! Win!
I think 'How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days' is the ultimate romantic comedy.
I would have to agree with you there. Kate Hudson and Matthew McConaughey were such a great pair.
They had all the great chemistry on screen!
That's how you know they're talented.
