Who was your favorite Disney character growing up?
I always liked the genie from Aladdin.
The one voiced by Robin Williams?
Yeah, he always made me laugh with his antics.
He was always a cut up.
Especially when he was getting cut up.
True. Do you ever find yourself singing his first song.
I still sing it everyday almost.
I catch myself humming it now and then when I hear the word friend.
Well you ain't never had a friend like me.
