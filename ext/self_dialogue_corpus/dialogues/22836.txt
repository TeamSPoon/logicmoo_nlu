Who is your favorite actor?
Daniel Day-Lewis, without a doubt.
Oh yes, he's one of the best. He always picks great scripts too.
Exactly - you know the movie will be great because he's very discerning about what he does.
He only makes a movie once every few years, right?
That's right. He's incredibly picky about what projects he does.
I guess that's why he only ever works with huge directors like Scorsese and Spielberg.
My favorite movie of his isn't even by one of the big Hollywood directors.
Oh really? What is it?
'There Will Be Blood', directed by Paul Thomas Anderson.
That movie was incredible. It absolutely blew me away.
Day-Lewis completely deserved his Oscar for it.
I forgot he won Best Actor for that film! Yes he did deserve it, he was terrifying.
The movie was already brilliantly written and he brought it to life.
The scenery in that movie was stunning, too.
Even though it's long I could watch it a million times.
Some people found that film boring, apparently.
I can see why - it's more about character progression than action and big explosions.
I think people are spoiled nowadays with all the action. Not everything needs to move a mile a minute.
Agreed. 'There Will Be Blood' is a good example of the benefits of slow storytelling.
