Hey, have you seen the Underworld Blood Wars yet?
No, have not had the time.
Oh this one is really good like the others.
What is this one about?
The Ware Wolf leader is very strong and is trying to take out the Vampires.
How does he do that?
He is able to kill vampires using new technology.
Do go on.
The hero and boyfriend has to fend off the Lycans and Vampires that betrayed them.
Oh wow.
They go to a frozen part of the world to see Vampires that do not fight or kill innocent people.
Why?
To get secrets to more power. and the bad guys show up of course. The hero is killed.
Oh no, then what?
It turns out that the other Vampires saved her and she became even stronger.
Did they win?
Oh yeah and got revenge and she became part of the counsel.
From hunted to counsel what a big change.
There is more but you have to see it yourself.
I think I will rent it this weekend.
