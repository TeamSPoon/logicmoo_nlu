Hey, did you get your new TV yet for the NFL football season.
Yes I did! I got a new 84 inch LCD flat screen that should help us get into the game!
Man I can't wait for the season to start.
Me either! NFL pre-season should be starting next month.
Who is your favorite team this year?
My  favorite team is the New York Giants.
Who is the Giants quarterback?
Eli Manning is the Giants quarterback and has been for a long time.
When did Eli start with the Giants?
The Giants drafted Eli back in 2004 and he has been there since.
How has he done given his brother is the great Peyton Manning?
Eli has had a stellar career with the Giants winning two Super Bowls.
Thats right, who did they beat in the 2008 Super Bowl?
The Giants beat the Patriots in one of the greatest comebacks ever.
Thats right! I remember the epic one hand catch off the helmet on 4th down to save the game.
Eli made that game saving throw while almost being sacked!
That was one of the best and most exciting Giants game of all time.
Yes it was, the Giants were a huge underdog to the Patriots.
I hope this NFL season is just as exciting!
Well at least it will look great on that new super huge TV!
