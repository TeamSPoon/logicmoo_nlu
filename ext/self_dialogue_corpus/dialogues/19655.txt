What types of music do you like?
Mostly pop. You?
I like a little bit of everything, except for Country. Not into Country.
I'm not either, but Carrie Underwood is an amazing Country singer.
I saw her on American Idol. She was good.
One of my favorite songs is "Before he cheats", and I also like, "Blown away"
I haven't heard "Blown Away". I have heard "Before he cheats" though. It's okay.
Do you like Taylor Swift?
Yes, I do. Her pop music, not her country songs.
Do you have any of her albums?
No. Do you?
Yes, I have "1989", "Red", "Fearless", etc.
Nice. Have you seen her in concert?
Yes, she's amazing. Her voice sounds just as good live as it does on the radio.
Her song "Bad Blood" has a pretty good beat to it.
The remix with Kendrick Lamar?
Yes, the remix.
It does have a good beat. I loved the music video!
Same here. She had a ton of celebrities in it.
Even Mariska Hargitay from Law and Order SVU! So cool!
