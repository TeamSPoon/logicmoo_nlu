What superhero movie is your favorite?
Captain America: Civil War
The acting and directing was great in that movie.
I loved how they got all those characters in one movie.
They managed to introduce 2 characters and have everything else going on.
It was movie history, never have heroes fought against eachother
My favorite Is Guardians of the Galaxy.
That movie is funny.
It has action, great affects and it's funny what more can you ask for.
I love superhero movies.
