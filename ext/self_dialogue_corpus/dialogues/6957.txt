I was just thinking about The Lion King today.
Oh yeah? What inspired that?
I overheard a conversation about the soundtrack earlier.
It does have some great songs! And some great catch phrases.
Wasn't one of the songs a big radio hit?
Yeah, I think so. Some famous singer made it super popular.
And it's such a sad movie, but Simba succeeds.
He does. Even despite the untimely death of Mufasa.
And the challenges presented by Scar.
At least he has Nala by his side.
