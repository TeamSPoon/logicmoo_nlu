Why are all these guys wearing denim shorts all the sudden?
Who knows probably some hipster trend.
Yeah I think its definitely a trend too but why
Someone in Hollywood did it first.
Who?
No idea but where do all trends emanate from?
The internet I would say
That may be true but mostly from TV
Well it looks terrible
Its not just that they are cutting their jeans apart
So then instead of buying shorts they are buying jeans
Which are more expensive
No one said guys know fashion
Its not just that, they dont know how to dress nor save a dime.
Well money has nothing to do with it
Sure it does, a look for less?
Yeah that sort of makes sense
So the jeans have to have a distressed look
You know someones going to attack that style soon
I think Abercrombie is already profiting off of it
