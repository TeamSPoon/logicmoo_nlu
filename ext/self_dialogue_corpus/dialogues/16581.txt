You ever listen to Beyonce?
I really can't stand her.
Why not?
I just don't like her in general.
What do you mean?
As a person, she just seems full of herself.
What do you think about her musical talent though?
She is actually talented.  I just can't listen to her.
Did you like her when she was in the group?
Destiny's Child?  I actually liked her then.
But you don't like her now?
Like I said, she seems to have an attitude.
What was your favorite song when she was with Destiny's Child?
Wow, I liked a lot of them.  They were great as a group.
Would you ever go see them if they had a reunion?
More likely than I would go see Beyonce solo.
Yeah, I wish they would get back together.
They were pretty good.
I wonder what happened to the other members.
I don't know, but they aren't as popular as Beyonce.
