I think they need to limit the goalies padding now.
Scoring was up this year thats crazy.
The NHL would be better served with a lot of 50 goal scorers.
I dont think we will see that again.
Yeah, like Paul Coffey used to score 50 as a defensman.
Again, that era is over.
But what if they did bring it back, wouldnt teams love the increase in viewership?
No, that wont do the trick.
What do you suggest then?
Changing their TV Partners.
Oh I see, why?
Comcast or NBC whoever is doing it is not pulling up their end of the deal.
So you wouldnt partner regardless of money?
Yep, I would go right to ESPN.
I dont know their numbers are down.
They are but thats for shows other than main sports.
Isnt hockey regionalized though?
Well sure but you can get compelling national games alot.
Like Chicago versus Detroit?
Yes or Philadelphia versus the Penguins
