Hey you ever heard of Tech 9
No who is Tech Nine
He's kind of a artist like Eminem
What kind of music does he play
Mostly rap and metal
Oh I really don't like metal
It's not like that death metal stuff is more a mix of rapping
What's your favorite song from them
I actually like this song called it's me
Oh cool can you send me it
Sure turn on your phone's Bluetooth and I can send you the song
Alright I just turned it on also what other songs do you like from him
I also like this song called clusterfuc
You know I don't like rap too much but I heard this song before
I know I really like the beat on that song
What about the lyrics
I don't really like his lyrics too much is like he raps on the 8th grade level
You're funny his raps are a little mature
Yeah he does need to step his game up a little bit
I'd rather listen to Eminem
