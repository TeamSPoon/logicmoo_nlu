Did you like Suicide Squad?
It wast terrible.
Thats not a ringing endorsement.
I just dont think DC does a good job with movies.
The Dark Knight was great.
Sure there are some outliers.
What didnt you like about Suicide Squad?
I Just feel like the writing wasnt that great.
Margot Robbie did a great job.
And so did Jared Leto.
So what was your problem.
Outside of those 2 it was boring.
I think Will Smith did a good job.
I am a bit tired of him. It has been too long
Even if you look passed him it wasnt all that bad.
It was a little long in my opinion.
I think it flowed well.
The storyline was stale too
Well they have to follow the comics
They can go off course if the plot calls for it
