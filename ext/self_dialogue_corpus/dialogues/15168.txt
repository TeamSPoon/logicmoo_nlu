Hey lets talk about music
Okay i love music
Who doesnt?
Right
What do you listen to.
It depends on my mood
Same here
I like a little bit of everything
Exactly
Inlisten to a lot of country and pop music though
I love country music
Me too, people say its depressing but i dont think ao
Me either, its a great genre of music
I completely agree
I really like rascall flatts and lonestar
Those are good bands
I dont think theres any country i dont like
Pretty much i really like mark chestnut and mindy McCready
I love them too
Good talking to you
