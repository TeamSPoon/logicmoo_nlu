Did you watch the playoffs last year?
I do every year
What did you think about them?
I was surprised at the performance of the Atlanta Hawks
Yeah, they were one of the best teams in the league
They totally destroyed my team
Which one is that?
The greenbay packers
Oh yes I remember that game. That was devastating to watch.
Yeah and it pissed me off a lot.
I would've definitely though that the Packers would have done better
I think every would have thought that
The only way they were able to actually score points was because they let them at the end
They could have easily shut them out
Green Bay had one of the best offenses in the league too
And they were only able to score 14 points
At least they lost in a heatbreaking way to the patriots in the superbowl
Yeah they did lose the most important game
How do you feel about that?
It makes me feel a whole lot better
