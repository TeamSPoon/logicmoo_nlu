Tell me about it.
This was a classic musical film from the past.
Like Fred Astire and Ginger Rodgers?
Well not quite that, but big musical.
What you mean?
There was lots of supporting characters who also performed.
What did they perform?
The would sing and dance.
Where was it set, a school?
Yes, the first one was in a High School they attend.
Are they all buddies that sing?
No just the opposite it is more about a bunch of different kids who sing and dance.
Are they all stars?
It is about finding that out in yourself.
Self discovery alsways a good theme for a musical.
