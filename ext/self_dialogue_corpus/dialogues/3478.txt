I just saw Dawn of the Dead.
Which version?
The 1978 version.
Was it directed by the same guy who did Night of the Living Dead?
Yes, George Romero, with Ken Foree and Gaylen Ross as lead actors.
What happens in the movie?
The group gets stranded in a shopping mall.
What happens in the end?
Two people escape in a helicopter.
I'm surprised anybody makes it.
