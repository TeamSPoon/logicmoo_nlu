You big into the Avengers movies?
I thought the first one was okay, but the subsequent ones were a bit much
Oh really, how so?
Well a lot of action and not much acting
Yeah, I guess that's true
Plus too many one-liners and campy characters
Any other comic book action movies that you like?
I really liked the new Logan movie
Oh yeah I heard that one was pretty intense
Yes, rated R and very violent, but I really liked it
