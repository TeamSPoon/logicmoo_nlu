Can you believe the NFL season is just two months away ?
I know, I can't wait
How's your team look this year ?
I'm a Cowboy fan , and I think we win it all this year
Cowboys look good , but I am a Viking fan and I think we might have something to say about who gets to Minneapolis
That's right, the Super bowl is in Minnesota this year isn't it
Yeah, and that makes it the perfect year for the Vikings to return to the Super bowl
How long has it been?
Forty years !
That's a long dry spell, but I'm afraid it doesn't end this year because the Cowboys will be there
Who do you think makes it from the AFC?
Probably New England again. How about you?
I think Pittsburgh is the team to beat and would make a good opponent for the Vikings
You mean for the Cowboys
Really, it's pretty wide open in the NFC.
Yeah, the Falcons and Packers should both be tough again
And the Saints could be unstoppable if AP comes back to form
Really a lot of teams have a decent shot
But I hope it ends up with the Vikings and Cowboys in the NFC championship, and it easily could.
If it does, it's big bet time for you and me.
