Man, Rogue One is such a messy Star Wars film.
In a good way though, right?
I don't know. It just feels disjointed.
What's disjointed about it?
For example, they spend most of the first act looking for Saw Gerrera, and then he tells Jyn her dad is alive, and dies.
So? He provided useful information?
Information which the characters already knew. He doesn't do much at all, besides eat up time.
But he also tortures the Imperial pilot guy. So there's that.
Yeah, and the pilot gets better immediately. Nothing seems to much matter until they decide to go to Scarif to steal the Death Star plans near the end of the movie.
I suppose the movie may have benefited from a little extra time in the writer's room, maybe.
