What is your favorite Harry Potter movie?
My favorite is the Goblet of Fire. I love all of the action in the different tasks of that movie.
I agree, there is a lot of fun in that one. My favorite is the Prisoner of Azkaban - I like meeting Sirius Black and hearing his true story.
Oh, that's a good one too! I love the relationship that develops between Harry and Sirius, but that mostly happens in later movies.
I also really like the relationship between Harry and Sirius. It's fun to see Harry have a father-figure, or more like a fun uncle, in his life. What do you think about the way Sirius dies?
Sirius' death is so weird to me. I can never figure out exactly what happens to him.
Yeah, that  was confusing to me, too. I don't like that it almost left the door open to him coming back, but he never did.
It was definitely one of the more unique deaths in the movies. Who is your favorite character in the movies?
I think my favorite character is Snape. His story is just so amazing. How about you?
I love Neville - his transformation from the first movie to the last is so huge, and I love how his character evolves throughout the series.
