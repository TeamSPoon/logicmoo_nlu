So what kind of music do you listen to?
Punk and hardcore mostly, what about you?
Same! Can't you see my jacket with the Black Flag and Misfits patches?`
Yup, I noticed. But there aren't many great punk or hardcore bands still around making new music.
I agree, its mostly just the old timers.
I mean, there's a band called Pissed Jeans that is amazing, but bands like that are few and far between this days.
I wish there would be another punk rock renaissance, it would be so great.
It's unlikely to happen, kids today are too complacent and apathetic.
Yeah, too much time spent face down looking at the smartphone.
Have you seen any old school bands performing live recently?
Yes I saw The Damned in Los Angeles in April.
Damn, they are old! How'd they play?
They were still amazing! Dave Vanian can still sing his butt off!
I bet, I love the Machine Gun Etiquette album.
Yes, that's an amazing record, as is the self-titled and the Black Album.
Ah yes I forgot about the Black Album! I need to spin that one again soon.
Who else do you like?
Oh you know the usual- Black Flag, Misfits, Bad Religion, UK Subs, Ramones, etc.
Me too, although I would definitely add The Clash to that list!
Of course!
