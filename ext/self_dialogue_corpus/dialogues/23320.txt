What's your favorite Pixar movie?
Either Toy Story or Finding Nemo.
I like Finding Nemo too.
It's amazing and funny.
Dory is hilarious
I know, she really keeps the comedy going with her memory problems.
I like how she's always singing just keep swimming.
She makes me laugh.
The movie is funny and emotional.
I cry every time I watch it.
You see how much the clown fish love each other.
He goes through so much to find him.
He rides the current
Then he fights sharks.
And the part when he is in the jellyfish.
Oh yeah. He saved Dory.
He finally get his son at the end.
I'm glad it has a happy ending.
Me too.
I need to watch it again.
