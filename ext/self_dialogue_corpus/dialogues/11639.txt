What is your favorite Beatle's song?
"Yesterday"
Oh yeah, that's a great song.
I always think of old times when I hear it.
It definitely brings back memories.
That's right, just like the song suggests.
That song takes me back to another time.
I know what you mean, I feel the same.
I experience the emotions of that time and space, when I hear it.
Ahh, the good old days.
