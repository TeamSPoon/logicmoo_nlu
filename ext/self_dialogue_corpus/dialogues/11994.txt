I just found out that the creator of Star Wars, George Lucas, is worth over 5 billion dollars.
Wow.  That's a lot of money.
Yes.  But he has been involved with a lot of successful films.
The Star Wars franchise is my favorite.
He used Harrison Ford in both Star Wars and Indiana Jones.
Harrison Ford recently landed on the jetway instead of the runway.
Wow.  He's getting forgetful.
Poor guy.  Is he still married to Calista Flockheart?
I think so.  Remember how that was such a controversy?
Not really.
