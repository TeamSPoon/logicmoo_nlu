what did you think about her meat dress?
well, i thought it was an interesting design but a little distasteful.
what do you mean by that?
well it's a dress made entirely out of meat. a lot of animals were killed for that
do you think lady gaga is against animals?
well she has done a few things that make me think that, specifically the meat dress though.
do you think she's likely to do that again in the future?
probably, she's very well known for doing crazy out there things.
yeah she does something new for each famous song she has
yeah i liked bad romance the best honestly
