What is the worst horror movie remake you have seen?
That's a good question.  The first one that comes to mind is Nightmare on Elm Street.
The one with Jackie Earle Haley as Freddy Krueger?
Yes, that's the one.  It was scary, but they went too far into the back story.
Yes, I didn't like the direction they took Freddy Krueger and the parents.
That's because Wes Craven didn't have a part in the direction of this movie.
It was interesting to learn about micro-naps in the movie.
They did keep that part realistic.  That was actually a little scary thinking you could fall alseep without realizing it.
The ending was kept similar though with Nancy's mom getting pulled by Freddy.
The original was still better, even without today's digital effects.
