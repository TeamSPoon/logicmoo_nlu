Who do you think is the best Pop Music performer?
Well, besides all the controversy I think Micahel Jackson.
Yes, he had so many great songs.
I loved Thriller.
That was good and the video was amazing.
Billy Jean was great too.
There were so many fantastic songs from him.
The Way You Make Me Feel is another favorite of mine.
We could go on for hours.
Yeah we could. way too many to pick from.
