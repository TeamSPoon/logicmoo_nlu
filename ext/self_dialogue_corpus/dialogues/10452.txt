I just caught the tale end of some show called Meet Joe Black.
With Brad Pitt.
Yes! I had never even seen it before.
That movie is really under rated, the film, the score.
I only seen bits of it, but it was really deep.
It is a sort of dark but also not so much film. The way they add the music in makes you feel the love and suspense. At least, what I saw.
The happy, but not really, ending. Anthony Hopkins did well in that movie.
He is always so out there and odd, in a good way.
Like Silence of the Lambs.
Yep, the way he plays those movies, he makes them classics.
The kind of shows that keep me thinking about them after they end, I always love finding them.
This one movie I watched, called pay it Forward was like that.
With Kevin Spacey?
Yeah, it made me think a lot. Had some really good tunes too.
I do not recall the music, but I remember the song giving me a feeling, know what I mean?
I do. That sort of emotion you can not place, I think that is sometimes from the music.
I think it might be. Maybe that is why we all recall cartoons so well.
I can sing every Disney movie song by heart.
I think that might be the point, nostaligia.
Maybe they make them knowing we will still love the music twenty years later.
