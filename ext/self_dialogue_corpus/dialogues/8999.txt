What kind of music do you listen to?
I love rock. Classical is okay, but I don't like country or rap.
I like rock too. I was a big fan of alternative rock in the 90s.
So I bet you liked Nirvana then.
Oh, I LOVED Nirvana. I liked Hole too, with his wife Courtney Love.
That's surprising. I know a lot of fans blamed her for his death.
I try to separate the art from the artist. Especially with bands.
That's probably a good idea, since a lot of rock stars are troubled people.
I wonder if being a troubled person caused the great music, or being a rock star caused the troubled person.
That's a really interesting question. Probably both.
