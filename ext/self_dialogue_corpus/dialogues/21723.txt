Would you like to go to the movies tonight?
Not really, I would rather stay in tonight.
That sounds fine with me.
Would you want to watch something here?
Sure, we could stream a movie if you like.
Actually I bought a DVD a few days ago for us to watch.
Great, what is it?
It is called The Founder.
Is that the one with Micheal Keaton?
Yes! He is awesome in it.
I seen that one when it first came out.
Was it any good?
Yes, I really enjoyed it.
Well since you have seen it we can watch something different.
No it is fine, I would love to watch it again.
Are you sure?
Yes! I like watching interesting movies again anyways.
Sounds like a plan then!
Alright, maybe after that we can watch something scary.
Sounds great.
