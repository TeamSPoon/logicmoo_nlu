Who is your favorite big band?
Glenn Miller, hands down.
I like Moonlight Cocktail.
I do too!  I really like Perfidia though.
I didn't know that was his!  I thought that was Cugat's.
It was Miller's but Cugat did a remake.
Cugat is my favorite.
Oh, I bow to no one in my love of Cugat.  But I consider Latin big band different than big band.
You're splitting hairs when they did some of the same music.
I think of Miller, Goodman, Harry James, and the Dorsey Brothers when I think of Big Band.
I still consider Cugat in there too.  I'm not as much of a fan of Desi Arnaz as a band leader.
Yeah, his stuff is just ok.
Without Lucy, he wouldn't have lived on.
Cugar was the best Latin band leader.
Do you like big band with or without singers?
It depends. Some songs are better with singers, but sometimes the vocals are annoying.
I agree. Sometimes the singer distracts like a bad musical number in a film.
Most of the great singers started that way though.
I like a group of singers better sometimes. Like the Andrew Sisters.
I like the Andrew Sisters too.
