Do you ever feel bad for Draco Malfoy?
All of the time! He is my favorite character.
He was just trying to make his parents happy!
And not get killed by Voldemort!
Oh yes that too. He did a good job with that!
And in the end his mom saved Harry!
Yeah when she said he was dead when he really wasn't!
She just wanted her son to be okay. They weren't all that evil.
But Voldemort and Bellatrix are truly evil.
They kill all the good people!
