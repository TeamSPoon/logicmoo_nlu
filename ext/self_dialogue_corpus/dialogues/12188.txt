Do you think Princess Leai will get a solo film?
Like how they are making a Han Solo one?
Yes, do you think they will show her life before a New Hope.
I hope so, she was so brave in the films.
I think it would be sad since the actress that played her passed away.
Carrie Fisher, that was sad.
I wish they would make some movie or at least show what she was doing between films.
I always wondered why she ended up a princess.
The movies do not give a real good back story as to how or why she ended up on Alderan.
And they left Luke on the sand planet.
