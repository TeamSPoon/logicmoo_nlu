How do you feel about the idea of more regular season games?
I would love if they would cut out one or two preseason games for regular season games.
What about risk of injury and health concerns for the players?
Well, on one hand, they are signing up to play a rough sport, so I think they should be aware of that.
Right, but as it stands 16 games in 17 weeks is a rough schedule.
It is. So, lose two preseason games, add an extra bye week, expand the roster.
Do you think NFL would ever consider a rotation for key positions? Like the MLB does with pitchers?
That would be an interesting idea, and would open up spots for more players.
I think fans would be concerned about the quality of play from their team, though.
That is a concern, like if you have a Tom Brady and then a bunch of backups who play.
NFL season isn't as long as an MLB season, though, so maybe they'd only need to rotate and rest their star once or twice.
Yes. And MLB teams still manage to dominate even with pitching rotations, so I think NFL teams could too.
So you'd only add one or two extra games to a season?
Yes. There comes a point when a season is too long and it feels like there are pointless games.
Again, like MLB and their 162 games per team per season.
Exactly. I think no more than 20 games, max, for NFL. Long enough for a decent season, but not enough where games feel pointless.
That's a good point. You don't want players in a rough sport playing games that don't matter much in the end.
Right. And I like the current length of the NFL season. It doesn't overlap other things too much.
Right between NBA and MLB, for the most part. And the season doesn't drag into too much extreme weather.
Yeah, I wouldn't want it starting too much earlier than it does; too hot for players in all that gear in summer.
