Did you ever see Animal House?
I have seen it many times. It is a classic comedy film.
It really paved the way for so many comedies to come.
John Belushi is incredible in that film. He was such an amazing actor.
He is great. But my favorite actor in the film is John Vernon.
What year was the movie originally released? It still really holds up!
It originally came out in 1978.
I think that critics said it was one of the best films of the year when it first came out.
I believe it! Some magazines ever call it one of their 50 most influential movies because of how many other films it inspired.
It really was a groundbreaking movie.
