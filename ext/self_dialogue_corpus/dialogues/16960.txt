Do you know of the band called Blink 182?
I have heard about them.
They really jam out in a fun way.
That is a good quality for a band to have.
All the Small Things is my favorite song by them.
Ok I will listen to them.
It is such a fun song that also sounds good.
They are a rock band?
Yes, they have an element of punk rock as well.
Ok I will have to check that out.
It is a great song, it was famous for a reason.
Ok I can believe that.
Their sound is so fun, the singers voice is slightly high pitched also.
That can make it sound harmonious.
Yes it is high pitched but also almost a punk song so it creates a unique sound.
That is good, to be unique.
Yes I agree, they are a special band.
Thank you for telling me.
They are really talented, they have many great songs.
Ok I appreciate you mentioning it.
