My sister just got a copy of the Aristocats.
I remember that movie, the cats with the accents.
Yeah, that one. I used to love that movie.
Me too! When I was young I'd sing all the cat songs.
What's the name of the song where all the cats are singing together in the house?
When they're having their piano lessons?
No, it's kinda jazzy. They meet with other cats to sing.
Is it towards the end of the movie?
Yeah, I think it is.
Hmmm, Everybody wants to be a cat, right?
