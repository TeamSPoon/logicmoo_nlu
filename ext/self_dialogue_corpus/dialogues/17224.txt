What kinds of music do you like to listen to?
I like most kinds of music, but it depends on what I'm doing at the time.  That determines the music that I listen to.
I know what you mean.  If you look at my music list on my phone, you would have no idea what my favorite is.
If I want to relax, then there's nothing better then soft classical or soft jazz.  It makes me so relaxed that I want to take a nap.
I know what you mean.  If I want to work out, then I don't think you can beat 80's rock.
Oh, I love 80's rock.  Brings back such great memories.
I think some of the latest pop music kind of does that as well.  Some of it's good to work out with.
It really depends on the beat.  I like a lot of Bruno Mars stuff.  He's easy to walk on the treadmill or jog with.
I especially like "Uptown Funk."  That has a great beat.
I like how catchy it is.  At a wedding I was at, the band played that.  People kept requesting it because it was so easy to dance with.
Maybe I'm weird, but I also like listening to that ambient music, especially at work.  It helps drown out other sounds.
I used to play that in my kids' rooms when they were going to sleep.  I think it helped them to relax and get to sleep.
Do you like country music?
Really, there are only a few artists that I like.  I always liked Tim McGraw and I still like George Strait and Toby Keith.
I like dancing to country music, but I don't really just listen to it at home.
I will say that I don't like hip-hop.  There is some rap music that I like though.
I agree.  If you were in my car, I would drive you crazy though.  I flip around a lot on the radio.
I know.  I drive my kids crazy.
I think I'm just a lover of music, and I hate to define one specific type that I listen to exclusively.
I agree.  There is good music in a lot of different genres.  There's so much talent out there.
