did Danny come over to yours last night?
oh no, he said he was taking a girl he just meet to the movies.
hahaha movies when did Danny do movies and cinema?
i think the girl loves movies and cinema so guess Danny probably doing it for her, he called asking me list of great movies as the girl wanted to watch whatever Danny chooses.
hahaha i see, so what were your suggestions?
'Wonder Woman" "Logan" "The Mummy" and "The Fate of the Furious" (FAF8)
what's FAF8 mate?
"Fast and Furious 8"
Oh i see , that seems like a great movie, i saw a teaser of it.
Yeah ive seen the full movie myself, though can't be compared with other FAF for 1 - 7 but still it has that action and intrigue that comes with previous FAF.
I guess Danny would watch that.
oh no, i gave me little summary of all the suggested movies storyline and he loved " Logan" and believes his date would also.
funny enough i have never heard of it the movie "Logan"
