Hey, have you seen the new Guardians of the Galaxy?
No, I have not. Honestly, I am not that much of a Guardians of the Galaxy fan.
Really? I thought you loved super hero movies.
I do, but more the classics.
What super hero movie is your favorite then?
I would have to say that my favorite is Captain America.
I do love the Captain America movies.
I really like the Avenger movies that he is in as well.
They are good movies. I heard that they are making more.
Really? I look forward to seeing more!
