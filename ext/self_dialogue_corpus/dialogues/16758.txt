Do you like music Awards?
I Like bands to receive them. Not the shows.
Why not?
They just take too much time.
I know what you mean.
Yeah, then the band is only out there for 30 seconds.
Yeah that does suck.
I will never watch one.
I have been to two.
Really, did you like it.
Yeah, it was cool.
Did you sit next to any one famous.
No,I wish.
How did you get those tickets?
My cousin works for Sony.
So cool, does he get toy autographs.
Every once in a while.why?
Just asking.
Would you like one of me?
No thanks.
