Are you a Guns n Roses fan?
Of course! Well, the classic stuff anyway.
Like 'Appetite for Destruction'?
Yes! Iconic album. So many great songs.
Looking at it now, it's like a greatest hits. So many songs became big.
They didn't even release that many singles from that album either, did they?
No - the album itself just got so popular all the songs on it became huge.
Crazy to think what happened to Axl Rose when you look at him in the 90s.
I know, right? A great vocalist with such stage presence, and now he isn't doing anything.
A real shame. They were a hell of a live band in their prime.
