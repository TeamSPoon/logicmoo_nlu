Do you follow all the Star Wars movies?
I've seen every one of them.
I read the books too.  But I really love the movies.
Did you hear about the Han Solo Movie?
Yes.  It's not really in the series, but it's still considered a Star Wars movie.
It's a prequel?
No Harrison Ford?
He's too old now to play himself at that age.
That's too bad, because he used to be really hot.
He still is, just too old to play himself before Star Wars 4, which is really the first one that came out.
That really confuses my Mom.  She was a teenager when that one came out.  She likes to call that the first movie.
My Dad is like that.  They must be about the same age.
Sigh.... I  can't imagine being that old.
Speaking of old...I understand that Ron Howard has taken over as director.
Yeah, isn't he like, as old as our parents?
Yeah.  His kids are our age.  or older.
What happened to the other directors?
I don't know.
I don't either.  Something about "creative differences"?
Doesn't matter.  We know Mr. Howard will do a great job!
