What's your all time favorite Disney Movie?
It would have to be Aladdin.
Oh yeah. Robin Williams was awesome in that.
I also liked Emperor's new Groove.
For me it would have to be the Liion King.
How could I forget that one.
Lioin King must be the best Disney film of all time.
Pretty much.
I wonder how many made for home release videos they did off of that one alone.
It has to be at least 10?
