You heard that Prodigy died?
Yeah man. I played all those Mobb Deep classics for like three days straight.
Three days? Man, I got Mobb Deep music scattered all over my playlists.
I ain't gone lie, me too. I be banging that Murda Muzik album.
Ain't that the one where Ghostface from Wu-Tang is on one of the tracks.
Yeah. It's the one where they be like you niggs can't f with the people i f with.
Yeah, that's it. That song the truth.
Man Havoc too. All three of them on that track together? They rewrote the game with that one.
I know. That's when everybody started making feature appearances on everybody else tracks.
How 'bout Shook Ones?
That goes without saying. Classic. I like the few songs Mobb Deep made with 50-Cent.
Oh you talking about Out of Control and the other one. What was the name of the other one?
Got it Twisted.
Yeah, that's it. I know you heard the remix they did with the bull Twista?
You already know. Man, they don't make music like they used to.
Well yeah, the bull Twista he got some bangers now.
I know but he got that down south, dirty south sound.
What that mean?
Man, the south music is a bit...different.
Man you trippin'. I can listen to T I and Future all day. And don't forget that bull Mystikal.
