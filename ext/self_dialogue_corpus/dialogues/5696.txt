Who is the best Disney villain?
I'm gonna have to go with Jafar.
No way. It has to be Scar.
Let's not forget Ursula from The Little Mermaid.
Oh, she is so scary.
Remember at the end when she got huge?
Yes, that was very cool.
She is the best female villain for sure.
I'm not sure. The wicked queen from Snow White is very good.
I agree. Maybe it is a tie between her and Ursula.
