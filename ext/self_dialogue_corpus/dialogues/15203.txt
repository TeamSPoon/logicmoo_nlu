Woah, have you heard Duke Ellington's 40s music?
Oh, yeah, I have. It's just downright incredible. The early stuff with Blanton on bass and Webster on sax is mind blowing.
Yeah, I had Jack the Bear as my ringtone for a while.
Oh, that's awesome!
Yeah, I figure it's attention grabbing, but won't annoy people on elevators.
I'll bet they loved it! What's your ring tone now?
Pow R Toch by Pink Floyd.
Chhhhhh chhhhh.    Chhhhh chhhhhhhh.   Doy doy!  Doy doy!
Exactly!  It's fabulous.
I love it!  I'll have to change my ringtone.
What are you going to change it to?
I don't know.  I'll have to think about it.  Maybe Singin' All Day!!!
Oh, that's a great choice!  Will you use Tull's or Tommy Dorsey's.
Now that's a hard choice!  Which version did you hear first?
Dorsey, if you can believe it!  I'd heard a lot of Tull, but not that song!
Oh, that's great!  So you heard Jo Stafford rocking out in the 40s, and then Tull's version?
Yes.  I couldn't believe it! It's amazing how much groups harken back and transform things.
Yeah, I love the part in it when Tull sings, "Is that her in the fur coat, no it's not December yet, my my my."
Yeah, and I love the part where he sings, "I sing very softly so if the phone rings .... I can hear it...I can hear it!"
I love that, too!
