What do you think about the new Tron remake?
I think it's good, different from the original, but good.
The graphics and animations are so much better than the original.
Yes but bear in mind that the original was made in 1982. Back then the graphics were cutting edge.
Imagine if that was you and were transported on to the grid!
It would be crazy, especially if you were riding around on those light cycles.
Yes but you would also have the battle tanks after you!
What I don't understand is how did the power remain on at Flynn's Arcade for all that time in the Tron Legacy?
I don't know... maybe his other business kept paying the bills.
Probably!
