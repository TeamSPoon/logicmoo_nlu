When are they going to come out with a new Indiana Jones movie?
I don't know, maybe they think everyone is tired of them.  I'm not...
What did you think of the ending to Passengers?
I kind of expected it but it was a little bit of a surprise.
I watched Logan last night.  I was good but not all that great.
Really?  I thought it was really good.  You must not be a fan of Wolverine.
I am a fan of Wolverine but I thought the movie Logan kind of dragged along.  Too many car chases.
Yeah, maybe but it did have a lot of good action scenes and it kept with the theme of X Men.
I guess I like all of the X Men characters to be in the movie, with all their various special talents.
X Men does have a lot more special effects and stuff but as a story, Logan in itself was pretty solid.
Wow, another monkey movie.  War for the Planet of the Apes is on at 7:30.
I'm not sure I'm up for that.  How about a romantic comedy?
Aw, not another romance-comedy.  How about Spider-Man: Homecoming?  It's a little of both.
Alright, I liked the last Spiderman but you're buying the popcorn.
You're a fan of history, why don't we stream Dunkirk?
That sounds pretty good.  Have you read any reviews on it?
Nevermind, Dunkirk isn't even out yet.  It comes out in July or something.
Oh, too bad.  How about Kong: Skull Island?
What is Dark Tower about?
I heard it's some kind of western with a mystic twist about protecting a tower or something.
