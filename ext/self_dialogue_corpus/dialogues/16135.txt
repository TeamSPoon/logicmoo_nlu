Have you heard of Hopsin?
No, who is he?
He's a successful underground rapper, but his style is so different.
I don't like rap that much.
I know, but he is different and you may change your mind after hearing him.
What makes him so special?
His music deals with real life problems and doesn't glorify the inappropriate parts.
Sounds interesting, but I still don't like rap.
I don't expect you to immediately, but try and give it a shot.
What should I listen to if I were to try?
He has a whole story set out called The Ill Mind of Hopsin. Listen to number 5 first.
Why would I start at 5?
It doesn't have to be in order and 5 is the best one in my opinion.
Okay, no problem. Is he like Lil Dicky at all?
Not really, but similar in the sense it isn't mainstream.
Okay good because I can't stand the mainstream rap.
Yea, that's why I turned to underground.
Is there anyone else I should try?
Start with Hopsin and if you like it I can show you a few other artists in the underground rap scene.
You got it man!
