Just 3 weeks until NFL training camps open.
Can not wait!
My Titans are going to be really good.
Why you say that?
Well, Mariota gives them a passing game.
He should be goodl
He's been working with Manning!
That will speed things up.
They also beefed up the O-line.
That's good to hear.
Derrick Henry should be a beast on short yardage.
That should improve red zone efficiency.
Still need defensive work.
They're an enigma, sometimes really good.
They came along in 2nd half of last year.
They've go a terrific LBer core.
Yeah, they just need help in secondary.
Could be a weakness.
Still, I think they can move the ball better and that will hide some weaknesses on defense.
Playoffs sound like a probability then.
