Did you see the Nationals game Thursday?
No, I did not get the chance. How did they do?
They lost, four to ten.
Who did they play again?
They were playing the Pirates.
Oh, I follow them a bit. But I follow the Mariner more, did you catch any of that game.
They won right?
Yeah, beat the White Sox by one point. How do you think they will do this season?
I mean they are looking pretty good. The White Sox had a decent season and they still managed to beat them.
I think they will do great. I hope the Mariners make it all the way.
They played again yesterday.
They lost though, but not by a lot. Just one point.
I seen that game. They really tried, it was a close one.
They play again Tuesday.
How do you think they will do?
Up against the Nationals? I think they have a fighting chance. Would give them a leg up in the season
I think they can beat them. I mean they are not he best, and the Mariners had a strong few games.
I kind of hope they do. Would be nice to see them make it all the way, maybe even win.
I do not think they could make it that far! But who knows.
I think they should win the world series, they deserve it.
