Who is your favorite spiderman?
For me it is easily Tobey Mcguire. I think he was so perfect for the part of peter parker.
I also preferred him over andrew garfield.
Yes, I do think it worth saying that the spiderman films with Tobey are just better films than the amazing spiderman with andrew in general.
Yes I agree too. Sam Raimi the director had such a strong vision perhaps a better script and concept as well.
Sam Raimi is so good in general. I think stan lee being on the writing team makes a world of difference.
Was he not a writer on the amazing spiderman?
No he was not at all, to my knowledge. I think that goes to show how much Stan lee  is a genius.
Well when you have the creator on your team of course you will be head and shoulders above.
But I also think Tobey just gives a better stronger more believable portrayal of spiderman in general.
