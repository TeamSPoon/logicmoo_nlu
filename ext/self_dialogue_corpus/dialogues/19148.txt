So what do you think is the best new song out there right now?
Wow, that's a tough question!  I really love that Head Over Boots song!
Who sings it?  I haven't heard that.
It's Jon Pardi.
Oh he's great!  I love that Dirt on my Boots song that he does.
Yeah, that's another great one.  Seems like he sings about boots a lot.
Yeah, maybe that's just one of his themes.  What else have you heard that's good lately?
That Luke Bryan Hunting Fishing, Loving Everyday song is great.
Oh yeah, that came out about a year ago didn't it?
Yes it's been out for a little while but it's still a great song.  My kids love singing it.
Yeah, it definitely makes you appreciate the outdoors.
It brings up good memories for me when I think of it.
Luke Bryan always has such great songs, though.  I love his videos, too.
Yeah, Tailgates and Tanlines was a great album.
Oh yeah, he had so many hits on that one.  It came out pretty recently didn't it?
I wanna say it was 2011 so it's been a little while.
Oh I didn't realize it was that old.
Yeah.  He's been around since about 2007 so around ten years.
Wow, I only just recently heard of him.
Yeah, you should check out some of his older stuff.
