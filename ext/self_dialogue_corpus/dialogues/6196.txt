Did you ever see The Jungle Book?
I remember seeing the original one back when I was a kid.
Yeah, I never liked that one as a kid. The monkey characters kind of freaked me out.
I thought Baloo's character was kind of fun.
Yes, he had a lot of fun songs especially "The Bare Necessities"
Yes, I remember that one.
All of them seemed to be based in a jazz theme.
yes, must've been a theme back in the late 60s.
Is that when it was released?
Yes, 1967. A good while ago.
