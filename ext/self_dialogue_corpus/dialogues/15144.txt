Have you ever listened to some of Ellie Goulding's work?
She has some amazing songs, quite beautiful.
Oh yes, she really is.  I love her style and one of her recent ones is my favorites right now.
Which one is that?
I saw On My Mind Video, it's really a great song.
I heard the song , but I have not seen the video yet.
That video has over 230 milion views already.
It is amazing how the videos can go viral like that.
I started listening to her songs when a movie came out with one of my favorites of hers.
Which song is your favorite of Ellie's?
Love Me Like You Do is a huge hit, I am not sure how many that song received for views but its big I am sure.
Yeah, that song was in Fifty Shades, it was nice.
I think she received some awards for that song.
Some of her other work is great too, like Burn.
How Long Will I love You and First Time are fantastic, I probably need to get a DVD of her songs.
They have some sales going on over at Target and Walmart for DVDs right now.
Maybe I will go over there this weekend, and check out the sales!
Oh, I know. I love the music sales!
I go often just to see if I can get a few DVDs for my collection.
Let me know if you find anything.
