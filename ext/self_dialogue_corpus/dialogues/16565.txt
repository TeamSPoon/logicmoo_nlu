La la lalalalal boom! I love this song.
Really? I'd rather have mustard poured in my ears. Who is this?
Weird Al Yanovic covering Sean Cassidy's "Da Do Ron Ron".
Man, he's really stuck for material. But that wasn't what you were singing.
I don't know the lyrics.
You don't know the music neither.
Don't be hatin'.
Have you ever heard Weird Al cover Ray Stevens and "The Streak"?
I don't know that one. Any good?
About what you'd expect. But it does have a blistering accordion solo.
The accordion has been an overlooked rock instrument.
Did you know that Ian Anderson started on the accordion? This was before Jethro Tull when he performed under I. Andy and the Polka Boys.
Did you know that Weird Al is a vegan? I can really hear that influence in his music.
i don't know how to respond.
That means he doesn't perform meat related songs. Unlike that poser the Reverend Horton Heat who is a shill for the beef industry.
That song kicks butt. Look at the cows in the slaughter house yard, gotta hit in the head, gotta hit 'em real hard....
You should be ashamed. Cows are awesome. Pink Floyd loved cows.
What the heck does that mean?
Moooooooooo!
Please go back to the Do Ron Ron.
