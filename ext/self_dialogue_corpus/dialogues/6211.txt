Did you know that the Lion King is based on Hamlet?
Really? I've never heard that before.
I just found out the other day. It really puts things in perspective.
Yeah. I've never thought of it like that. So Simba would be Hamlet?
Yeah, exactly. And he mopes around and then comes to terms with taking revenge for his father.
On Scar or Claudius.
Right. It's amazing how Shakespeare plays still influence us today.
It is! Are there any other Disney movies like that?
Not that I know of, but I bet one or two have some influences!
I'll have to watch and look!
