What is your favorite team in the AFC North
has got to be the Pittsburgh Steelers
that is unfortunate
why do you say that?
because i am a Cleveland Browns fan
I think it might be more unfortunate to be a browns fan
ok you got me there
no kidding, the browns had a terrible 2016 season, did they even win a game
they did win ONE game
ha! who did they beat?
they beat the Chargers
now I feel bad for the chargers
at least  the browns got some good draft picks because of it
no kidding. they got the number 1 pick overall, three first-round picks and five in the first three rounds
yep. those were some valuable picks
who did the number one pick end up being
Myles Garrett from Texas A&M
what position?
He plays defensive end
that was a good spot for the Browns to fill!
