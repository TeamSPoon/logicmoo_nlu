I have to write a report on a movie about revenge do you have any suggestions on a good revenge movie.
Yes, the ultimate revenge movie would be John Wick.
Is it a good movie that is easy to understand?
Well it does have a lot of killing in it so if you don't like that sort of thing then it's not for you.
I don't mind that what is the movie about.
Well, this man named John Wick was this legendary assassin who retired when he married the love of his life.
Does Keanu Reeves play the lead in this movie?
Yes, he is John Wick. So his wife dies suddenly and she had bought a dog that he gets after she died.
She knew she was going to die right?
She knew when she died he would need something to love.
Okay, so what happens next?
John is at a gas station and this spoiled man want to buy his super cool car but John said, "it's not for sale".
So he doesn't sell his car to him.
Right, but this spoil man breaks into John's house, kills this dog, beats John up and steals his car.
But John was this assassin how does this man get the best of him.
John was still mourning the lost of his wife and he was caught off guard.
Oh, so after this he decides to get revenge.
Yes, he does and he is a walking killing force. He goes after this spoil man who is the son of the head of like a mafia.
So the mafia goes after him but he winds up the victor in the end.
Yes, you really need to watch it. It would be a great choice for your report.
