So have you seen any movies you can suggest?
Yes, actually!  I just saw a movie called Daddy's Home.
Oh, I heard about that.  How as it?
It was really funny!
Who was in that again?
Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg were the stars.
They're both great actors!  Will Ferrell is hilarious.
He sure is!  Mark Wahlberg was really funny too?
I had no idea!
Yes, he has been in a few comedies now.
What was the one with the teddy bear called?
Ted.  Daddy's Home was even better!
Well, Ted was a little cheesy for me.  I couldn't get past the talking bear concept.
I agree it was a bit much.  Daddy's Home was a little more realistic.
Still off the wall though, I imagine?
A little.  But it's definitely worth watching.
Isn't there a sequel coming out?
Yes, it will be in theaters later this year.
I have to say you convinced me!  Where did you see it?
I watched it online through Netflix.  Enjoy!
