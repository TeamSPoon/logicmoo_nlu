I was thinking I should give Frozen another chance.
You didn't like it?
I just couldn't really focus. I was on a plane and the kid behind me kept kicking my chair.
That sounds really unpleasant!
It was! And now I can only remember the songs, really.
Well, the songs were the important part.
Yeah, but I always like the story of Disney movies.
I can understand that.
Want to watch it together?
Sure!
