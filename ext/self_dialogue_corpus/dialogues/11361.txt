If you could pick one classic band to listen to, who would it be?
Probably the Beatles.  They are timeless
I completely agree.  What was your favorite album
Hands down Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.  What about you?
I'd say Yellow Submarine.  Just so many hits on that album
I think all of their albums had a ton of hits
Yeah that's true. I would love to have seen them live just once.
That would have been nice.  Sure beats most of today's music.
I think they are better than all of today's music.
You may be right honestly.
