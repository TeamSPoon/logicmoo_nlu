Ugh. I wish that these movie remakes would just stop already.
Why? Which movie are they remaking now?
They're remaking The Craft.
Which movie was that?
You know, the one with the four teenage girls who are witches. The three girls gang up on the good one with dark magic.
Oh, right. The one with Robin Tunney and Neve Campbell.
Yeah, that's the one.
I can't believe they're remaking that movie. I'll never get that scene from the original with all of the snakes, spiders, and bugs out of my head.
Yeah, I know. That was so gross.
Anyway, what's the deal with the remake.
I guess it is technically not a remake per se. It is more of a sequel.
So, are they just going to ignore the first movie?
No, the director said there would be callbacks to the first movie, but it will be its own story.
Well, I guess that makes it a bit more interesting.
Yeah. I want to see it, but I am scared that this will somehow take away from the first movie.
When does the remake come out?
They're saying that it is supposed to be coming out some time in 2017, but I also read that they're still working on the script.
It sounds like they are unsure of what they're doing.
A little bit, but at least you know it will be a bit horror filled because the writer for 10 Cloverfield Lane just signed on to write the script.
OK. Now, I am going to have to put this on my list of movies to see in 2017 or whenever it comes out.
