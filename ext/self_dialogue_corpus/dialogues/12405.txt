do you like star wars?
I love it and george lucas so much.
He really did a great job creating the original movies at least.
You don't like them all?
Not really, The ones george made in 2000s were not nearly as good.
I do agree the original three were the best.
I think DISNEY has done a great job on the newest ones.
I agree, but it makes me sad they are out of lucas's hands.
It is a little sad because he was the creator and mastermind of this world and now being run by someone else.
But he made a ton of money and I think probably happy his universe is living on still.
