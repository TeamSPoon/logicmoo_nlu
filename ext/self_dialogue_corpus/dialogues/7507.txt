What is your least favorite character in the Harry Potter series?
I would say Draco Malfoy.
Yeah hes a real douche of a character.
As much as I don't like him, he did seem to have somewhat of a heart in the last movie.
I think so too, but he was still young and didn't make any really life changing decisions yet.
What about Neville Longbottom?
I loved that character, how he was such a dork and clumsy.
He really ended up being a badass though towards the end of the series.
Yeah like how he stood up to lord voldemort.
That part of the movie was truly awe inspiring.
