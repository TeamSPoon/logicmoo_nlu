Did you see the movie The Heat?
The buddy comedy with Sandra Bullock?
That is the one, did you like it?
I did. I love buddy comedies.
There are a lot of them.
Have you ever seen Turner and Hooch.
No, who are the buddies in that one.
Well, one is a dog and the other is James Bulishi. Very funny.
What type of funny?
A sort of cop one. Kind of like Ride Along, but one guy is a police dog.
Well, it sounds odd, but could be cool. I like human ones.
Like Rush Hour?
Rush hour, Rush Hour two. They were so good back then.
I think they hold up now. Like Stir Crazy.
What is that?
With Gene WIlder? A classic one, so well written.
The jokes make those shows. Like 21 Jump Street, it was the jokes that made it funny .
They had great one liners, but chemistry too.
The chemistry makes the jokes work well.
Buddy films need both in equal parts I think.
