Have you ever seen that movie "Coming to America"?
I don't believe so. Is it a newer movie?
No, it came out in the 80s. It starred Eddie Murphy and Arsenio Hall.
I like Eddie Murphy! What's the movie about?
Eddie Murphy is a prince from Africa. His father the king wants him to marry someone he doesn't love.
Someone from America? Is that what the title means?
No, he comes to America to find a woman he does want to marry.
Oh, that sounds cool! What character does Arsenio Hall play?
He plays a servant that goes with Eddie Murphy's character on his journey to America.
I bet they're really funny together!
