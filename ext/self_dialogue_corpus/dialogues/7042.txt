You know what's a good movie?  Lady and the Tramp.
Oh yeah!
I hope they don't remake it anytime soon.  Leave it how it was.
Seems like it would be hard to remake that into a live-action version.
It would be all CGI.
There's been enough talking dog movies.
Up had a talking dog.
Yeah, but that was animated.  This would be total-CGI.
Some things are better left never remade and that's one of them.
Agree 100% with you.
