The soundtrack in The Force Awakens was kind of weak.
John Williams composed it, just like he did in A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back, and Return of the Jedi.
But the soundtrack was so prominent in those films. In The Force Awakens, it kind of disappeared.
I guess so. I can't really remember any tracks as memorable as the Imperial March or the Star Wars theme.
The effects in The Force Awakens was top-notch, though.
I agree. They really invested in practical effects, and it shows.
That was J J Abrams' work. He really likes practical effects.
It shows. In The Phantom Menace for instance, they did it all in CGI.
The green screening really hurt the prequel trilogy.
In those movies, the CGI looks badly dated now.
