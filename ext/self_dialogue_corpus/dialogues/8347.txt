I don't keep up with pop music is much as I used to, but there are few artists I like.
Same. Justin Bieber's pretty great.
I don't listen to him much, but I do like Selena Gomez and Demi Lovato.
Selena Gomez is great! I love her new single "Bad Liar".
Yeah, that's a good song. I'm liking Miley Cyrus's new stuff, too.
I actually saw her on one of those late night shows the other night. She sang beautifully.
She's very talented. I watched her at the Manchester benefit concert.
I heard she did a cover with Ariana Grande.
She did! They performed "Don't Dream It's Over" by Crowded House.
Nice. I'll have to look that one up on YouTube.
