I feel like renting an off the wall goofy movie.  Any ideas?
How bout a goofy Irish movie?  Love that kind of humor!
Have you seen 'Intermission'?
No, who is in that?
Cillian Murphy and Colin Farrell are the main characters.
Well, you couldn't get muh better than that, could you!
I do not think it would be possible!
Is it funny? Is itt quirky?
Oh yeah.  It is a riot.
Explain please!
For one thing, Colin Farrell plays a thug, with an almost bald head.
I would love him in just about anything, hairless or not!
Cillian Murphey is fairly young in this.  He is in a romantic crisis.
He is an awesome actor.
Those eyes of his are amazing.   Bluest I have ever seen.
What is it about?
There are a lot of intersecting stories. I wouldn't know where to begin!
But it is funny?  Has to be funny.
It is along the lines of 'Local Hero'.  Same sort of goofy humor.
Then let's rent it. Sounds like just what the doctor ordered!
