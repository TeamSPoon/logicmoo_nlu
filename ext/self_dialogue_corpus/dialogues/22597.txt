Favorite John Wayne movie?
Sand of Iwo Jima.
Oh man great movie.
The Duke was great in that.
Yeah he was, he was nominated for an Oscar.
Deservingly so.  It was all around good.
Yeah, a great Marine movie too.
I know, when I was in the Marines we used to watch it.
Yep, at the end it was sad that he died.
It was, that is kind of the reality though.
And then the showed the flag raising.
Remarkable part.  It's emotional for us Marines to see that.
That movie was also nominated for best sound and best story.
Too bad it didn't win anything.
That would have been awesome.  Still has a lot of respect to this day.
It actually has a 100% on rotten tomatoes.
Interesting.  You know with the 4th coming up maybe I'll watch that soon.
Yeah me too.  It's a good watch.
The cool part at the end is that guy he mentored kind of takes charge.
Yep, as in gotta get going.  War ain't over yet.
