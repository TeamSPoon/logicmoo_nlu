Hey what's your favorite scary movie?
Well it's not that one.
What's wrong with Scream?
Nothing it's just not my favorite.
Ok mister kill joy, what's yours then.
No one does it better than Kruger.
Oh please, Freddy four knives is your go to, how about one this millennium?
The nightmare is ever lasting, and by the way they had a remake in this millennium.
Remakes don't count for favorites, completely discredits the spirit.
Good point, but Dream killer beats psycho "Teenager."
Yeah, but everyone knew who Freddy was in every movie, Scream gave plot twists in all 4 changing the origins with each.
Look if you're throwing out my remake, then you don't get to count the 4th Scream.
Why shouldn't I include it? It's a continuation not a re-imagination.
I wasn't saying that on grounds of semantics, but on merit of film.
The last scream totally holds up to the trilogy.
Firstly, Randy would disagree with you on that one, and character veto is final veto.
That is really low, anyway what's second.
Second is that the killer was found out, not killed, it was a nice conversation in the kitchen then oh yeah by the way I'm getting arrested now.
It kept the same dynamic alive as the first one, tribute negates cliche.
Yes, but bad doesn't negate bad. It's out of the running.
