Is George Lucas involved in the next Star Wars movies?
You mean writing the script?
I mean anything at all.  Does he have say over what's going on?
Not really.  I'm sure they tell him what they're doing, but since he sold the property, he probably lacks some oversight.
Which is probably okay since he kind of butchered the prequels.
No kind of about it, he did butcher them.
I wonder how much he makes from these films.
Enough to build a large bank vault that he can swim in.
Like Scrooge McDuck, right?
Exactly.  George Lucas doesn't strike me as a swimmer though.
