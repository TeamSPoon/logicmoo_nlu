I finally saw Manchester by the Sea.
What did you think of it?
Well, it was good... but not as great as everyone said it was, in my opinion.
What about the movie did you not like?
I just think I saw the basic storyline in the previews: "I can't be the guardian."
No way. There was the whole dark past secret thing. You didn't see that in the previews.
I just didn't think it was great. Good and decent, but not Oscar-worthy.
Casey Affleck is a good actor, though. He did an amazing job.
I guess. I just thought it would be more riveting or something.
I thought it was great. I wouldn't mind seeing it again.
I was expecting more from the Michelle Williams character.
True. Her role seemed kind of small in comparison.
Kyle Chandler, too.
Yeah. But I think Casey Affleck's character was meant to be the centerpiece of the movie.
Of course. I get that.
But you were underwhelmed?
I don't know... I guess it just didn't blow my mind or anything.
You were expecting the movie to blow your mind?
Well, yeah. There was so much hype leading up to the Oscars.
Maybe it was overhyped a bit. But I still thought it was a great movie.
