So, how many wins will the Jets have?
They might not get any.
True. They are clearly tanking for next year's draft.
If you're going to start Christian Hackenberg at quarterback, that's the only possible message.
Yep. And there's no one to throw to, with Eric Decker and Brandon Marshall gone now.
No kidding. Who could they beat?
The Browns. Maybe. Perhaps the Bills on a really good day. Otherwise, I can't see a winnable game.
Yeah, they're probably going to be picked to lose every game.
That seems like it'd be fine for them, what with teh "Suck for Sam" campaign
There lies the silver lining: At least 2017 will end and they'll get a shot at a good QB for 2018.
But would San Darnold be the answer, if they land him?
I dunno. USC quarterbacks like Matt Leinart and Mark Sanchez have not translated well to NFL success, but Darnold is pretty good.
That's IF he comes out. He may end up staying into the 2018 college season.
But that's the advantage for the 2018 draft. Ther's Josh Rosen, Josh Allen, Mason Rudolph - a lot of QB options.
This is the Jets, though. They'll screw it up.
Maybe. They have been without a franchise quarterback since ... well, Joe Namath, really.
Goodness, has it been that long? I can't take any more of watching these guys.
One more terrible season, then it should begin to swing upward, my friend.
I sure hope so. I'm already dreading Sundays this year.
Could be worse. We could be Browns fans.
