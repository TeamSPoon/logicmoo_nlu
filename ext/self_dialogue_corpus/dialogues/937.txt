Who do you think will win the MVP award this year?
Derek Carr will probably win it based on how much they missed him last year and how much hell improve this year.
Do you think the Patriots will win it again?
I dont think so.  I think they might be on the decline as the divsion gets better and they get older.
Will the Titans make the playoffs this year?
I think they could get in the wildcard.
Do you think Adrian Peterson will be effective in New Orleans
I think he will improve their offense but not enough to make a playoff run.
Who do you think will win the NFC North?
Im guessing the Packers will but if the Vikings can get better and be more consistent I could see them making a run for it
Will the Browns be any good this year?
They have a lot of good pieces but i dont know if they can get more than 4 wins this year.
Will the dolphins be able to upset the Patriots this year?
They could outscore them with their offensive skilled players but im not sure the defense can stop tom brady

No I think theyre about to be in a long drought without making the playoffs.
How many games do you plan on watching?
I plan on watching all the Vikings games but after that Im not too sure.
Will Dak Prescott improve his game this year?
I think he will get better but the competition will be much better so Im not sure his stats will improve much.
