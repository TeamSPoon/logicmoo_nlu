Do you think that Leveon Bell will stay healthy this season?
I sure do hope so. He is my favorite running back.
You like him more than Adrian Peterson?
Yes, I do. I like and respect Adrian Peterson though.
I would really like to know who is faster between Leveon Bell and Antonio Brown.
My money would be on Antonio Brown.
I would have to give it to Leveon Bell.
Why do you say that?
In my eyes, running backs always seem to be faster than wide receivers.
That may be true. It is their job to run after all.
That and the fact that wide receivers are agile when it comes to cutting.
I wonder who some of the best downhill running backs in the NFL are.
Same here, I don't really pay too much attention to running backs.
Me neither, except for the new boss Ezekiel Elliott.
Yeah, Ezekiel Elliott is awesome both athletic and personality wise.
Have you seen his hit on Kam Chancellor after Kam Chancellor blindsided him?
No, I haven't what happened?
After Chancellor hit him, after a play, Elliott was running the ball and dropped a shoulder into Chancellor.
I bet that hurt, Chancellor is the bigger guy.
True, but Elliott sent him a pretty good distance backwards.
