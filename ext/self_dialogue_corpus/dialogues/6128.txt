When I was a kid, I loved going to Magic Kingdom. My favorite park has to be Hollywood Studios, though.
Can't beat Epcot, that place has everything!
Yeah, it does, but I still like the whole "retro" thing, best. Didn't the Norway ride get replaced?
They practically turned the whole place into Arendelle for Frozen.
I sometimes hear little kids still singing "Let It Go" when I'm walking through the mall.
You've been to Animal Kindgom, right?
Once, but it was sweltering! I hate it when it gets that hot!
They're putting in a new Avatar thing in Animal Kingdom.
Seriously? It feels like only a short time ago they put in that new restaurant at Magic Kingdom.
That one? Yeah, you have to wait for years to eat there.
