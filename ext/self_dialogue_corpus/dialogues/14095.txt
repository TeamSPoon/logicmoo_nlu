What is your favorite lady gaga video?
Telephone because it was her and beyonce together. Not sure it gets better.
I liked that video a lot. I think it even won an award at some point.
I know that Gaga wrote the song for Britney Spears originally.
Woah, I had not clue. How did she end up doing it then?
I don't know exactly but so glad it was her and not britney.
Nothing against spears , but I am so glad it was gaga and beyonce in the end.
Ya, i don't think britney would have been right for it.
Maybe we are just biased, I know I prefer Gaga in general.
I like britney a lot but feel Gaga is more talented especially vocally over britney.
