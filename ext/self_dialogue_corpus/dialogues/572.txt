Could you believe the foorball season is right around the corner?
NOpe! Can you?
Me either. I seriously cannot wait. Have you had a chance to chekc out the schedule yet?
No, I haven't gotten it in the mail yet. Is it even out yet?
That is a very good question, I am not really sure.
Ya me either. Who do you think is going to win it all this year?
Oh geez, who knows. I would like to say my Steelers, but who the heck knows.
As long as it isn't the Pats right? Lol
So true!
I would like to see an underdog take it this year.
Yeah me too. Or maybe Matty Ice will seek revenge.
Wouldn't that be awesome. Poor guy.
Yeah my heart really went out to him last year. That is one heck of a way to lose.
Or what about the Las Vegas Raiders?
Oh, do not even get me started with that.
I would love to see the black hole take the reigns agaiin and dominate. I just do not see it happening.
The Las Vegas Raiders sounds like an arena football team or something.
Al Davis is rolling around in his grave.
Just win baby.
Right.
