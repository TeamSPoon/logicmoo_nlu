Have you seen that movie Signs?
The one set in the crop fields?
Yeah I think it's by Shyamalan.
Yeah I saw it.
How'd you like it?
I think it was kind of slow, but I liked the religious part of it.
I thought it was a bit slow too. I also would've liked if the alien was more visible throughout the movie.
Yeah that's a good point. What'd you think of the weakness to water?
That was horrible. They could've done something else that made more sense.
Yeah. You'd think it'd get wet from the crops or just die because of humidity.
I attribute that to the country being very dry, but yeah it's an oversight.
Yeah that movie wasn't so great. Sixth Sense was though.
Yeah Sixth Sense was great.
The plot twist at the end was amazing.
Yeah it was. It was even better when realize all the clues the movie had.
I caught it all watching it a second time.
What do you think of his Avatar movie? I remember you watched the cartoon.
I don't like to talk about it. Avatar deserved a better adaptation.
So you won't be watching the sequel he plans to make?
No.
