I heard you hate John Phillip Sousa.
Duh. He's one of the worst composers I've ever come across.
Why? Everyone loves him. His music is so patriotic!
Is it?
Yes?
Is it patriotic, or is it a march that was LATER turned into patriotic because people used it at concerts?
It's both--he did write these intentionally for a touring American band.
Right, but it's a march. It's not outwardly patriotic.
What bugs you the most about him?
Stars and Stripes Forever. I hate that march.
Why?
Well, the supposed super-difficult piccolo solo is so easy that high schoolers can play it, and on any instrument. It's not hard.
Maybe it's just nostalgiac.
Maybe. But it's overplayed.
How much have you played it?
I was touring in Europe with a band, and we played it at every concert. And in undergrad, we did an all-Sousa concert.
My God. Even I think that's torture.
Yeah, it was pretty excruciating.
I'm sorry you had to live through that.
I avoid his music at all costs now.
