Are you a fan on Jack Nicholson?
Of course! Oh my gosh, has done so many good movies.
It seems like he can handle so many different types of roles so well.
Yes. Remember when he was in Anger Management with Adam Sandler.
That movie was hilarious. Did you ever see The Shining?
Yes! That movie was awesome!
It is one of those movies that is forever unmatchable.
The suspense was great in that. It was based on a Stephen King story I believe.
Remember Shelly Duvall?
Yes! Remember those creepy twins that would appear sometimes?
Of course!
Apparently they've appeared at some conventions together.
That's great. I can still hear the voice of the guy who originally showed that family around the place they would be watching.
Scatman Crothers.
Yes. He has such a unique voice.
He really brings back memories of those old movies.
Speaking of Stephen King, I'm looking forward to that new one coming out.
Which one?
The Gunslinger.
Oh. That's from The Dark Tower series.
