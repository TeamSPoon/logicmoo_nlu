So I'm a bit confused about Harry's parents.
What part is confusing?
His dad was a total jerk and his mom was nice.
Yeah.  So?
I thought it his parents would have been more pure.  Seem like that's kind of how Harry was supposed to.
No way.  Harry was supposed to be conflicted.
Just seems weird to me that Harry shouted all the time.
That was his dad's rebellious side.
Maybe Harry is just a jerk.
You try being the boy who lived!
