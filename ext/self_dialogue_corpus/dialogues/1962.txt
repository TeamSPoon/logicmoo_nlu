I don't understand your obbession with the NFL.
I don't have an obesseion.
You watch every game you possible can.
Yes, I like the game.
You more than like it. You are crazy about it.
It is fun for me to watch. It is my release.
Well, I think it is dumb.
You are entitled you your opinion.
I thikn you need to back off of it for a while.
Well, I am not going to stop watching football.
I will leave if you don't.
You will leave if I don't stop watching the NFL?
Yes, I will.
That is what sounds dumb. I am not cheating or lying to you about anything.
I know, but I feel neglected.
Watch it with me.
I don't want to.
I don't know what to tell you.
Tell me that you will stop.
I will just help you pack.
