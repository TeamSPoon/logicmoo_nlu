What types of movies do you like?
I like a little bit of everything. What about you?
Same here, I'm not overly picky. Have you seen "Fifty Shades of Grey"?
I did, but I'm not a big fan of it. Or the second one.
I watched it mainly because of Jamie Dornan. I'm a fan of his.
What other movies has he been in?
A bunch. "Anthropod", "Burnt", "Flying Home".
Oh that's cool. Have you seen "The Notebook"?
Yes, it makes me cry everytime I watch it.
Me too. It's a beautiful love story.
I loved Noah, who was Ryan Gosling's character.
He was so great to Allie. He loved her so much.
He really did. I was happy they ended up together, but the ending was so sad.
I thought it was really sad too, but almost bittersweet that they passed away together.
That's true. What other movies do you like?
I like Tim Burton films. Those are a lot of fun.
Like "Beetlejuice"?
Yes, that's a classic.
I love that movie, too. No one plays Beetlejuice like Michael Keaton.
Agreed! He was so funny!!
