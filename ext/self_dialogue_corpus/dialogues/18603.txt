Hey, it's great to see you here.
I'm glad I saw you too.
I am excited to see this concert, are you?
Yes, I am excited to see it as well.  It's not too often that I get to go to a Luke Bryan concert.
I just love country music.
I do too.  It is so much fun to line dance when the right song comes on.
Did you go to any other concerts recently?
I have been to a couple of local festivals with local bands and artists.
Those are always fun because you can discover new talent.
I know.  I sometimes enjoy listening to new songs from new people.
I get sick of listening to the same songs over and over again on the radio.
It seems like they play the same 10 songs on repeat.
Do you listen to regular radio?
Yes, but I also like listening to Pandora, sirius, and spotify on occasion.
I listen to the free versions of those.  I don't like to have to pay much to listen to my music.
I only pay for sirius and usually get a deal for about 5 dollars a month.
That's not too bad of a price.  I could afford that.
It is worth it to be able to listen to music without commercials.
Well, enjoy the concert.
You too!
