I heard a really great soundtrack today.
What was it?
Take a good guess.
Uh, okay.  Schindler's List?
Way off.  It's actually La La Land.
Ah, I heard that's a winner.
Most definitely.  Have you heard it?
Just from the movie is all.
You should give it a listen.  So many great songs.
What's the best, that City of Stars song?
Nah, most popular, but not the best.
Okay, so what's your favorite?
I think the pinnacle of the album is Someone in the Crowd.
What's that one about?
It's the song you hear while she's getting ready for the party.
Around the beginning of the movie?
More or less, but anyway, it's the best song.
You should burn me a copy of it and I'll give it a listen.
I will do that if you like.
Appreciate it.  I need to hear some good music!
