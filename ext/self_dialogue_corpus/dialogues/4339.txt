What do you think about thriller movies switching from gory violence to more psychological?
I like it, for the most part; "Babadook" was incredible, but I wish they would quit with the sequels.
I agree, it's like the find a good niche and exploit it until they've run the idea into the ground.
Exactly! "Sinister", for instance, was crazy scary, but the sequel was a clear cash grab.
I felt really weird watching the sequel too, it was basically just watching families get murdered in terrible ways with a little plot thrown in.
And can we talk about Shannyn Sossamon's southern accent? I kept wondering how no one on set said anything.
In that same vein, have you seen Insidious or the sequels?
I saw the first one. I thought it was really good until the end, it got weird and campy in the last third of the movie.
It definitely violated the idea of "less is more" when it comes to showing a monster.
They just got excited about using those scary prosthetics, I guess.
