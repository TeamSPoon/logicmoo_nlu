How often do you like to watch NFL football?
Pretty often, who is your favorite team?
My favorite team is the Pittsburgh Steelers since I'm from around Pittsburgh.
I really don't like them since I'm from around Philly and like the Eagles.
Thats too bad because I think we are going to win the super bowl this year.
Really? How many more years do you think Ben Roethlisberger has?
I'm not sure but definitely no more than five.
Yeah I can't imagine he'll be playing in the league for much longer.
How often do you get to go to the Eagles games?
Not too often, I usually have to work on Sunday mornings so I never get to actually go to the games.
Surely you could go when they play Sunday or Monday night!
Yeah I could, the last time I went they played the Baltimore Ravens and it was a really good game.
That's awesome, did you like seeing Joe Flacco play?
Yeah it was really cool to see him play since he's so good but I didn't like to see him do well against the Eagles.
Did you know the Baltimore Ravens used to be the Baltimore Colts?
Yeah I did! My dad used to be a big fan of them and the Houston Oilers.
Houston used to be the Oilers? That's crazy I thought they were always the Texans!
No! Although the Texans are a really good team nowadays after making it into the playoffs last year.
Yeah since they got the new head coach Bill O'Brien they've been doing really well.
I forgot about that, didn't he coach for a college team recently?
