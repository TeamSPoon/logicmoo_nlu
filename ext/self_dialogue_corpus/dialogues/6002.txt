Have you seen Moana yet?
Sort of, I've only seen a little bit.
Why? The whole movie is great.
Honestly, I just turn it off after a while!
Wow, the music is amazing though!
Oh, yeah I like "How Far I'll Go" a lot.
Me too! I think the message is adorable.
Yeah, the whole theme of the movie is cute from what I've seen.
You need to see it all to understand the full message!
I know, I really need to.
