Howdy!
Heya! How's it going?
Well thanks, and you?
Pretty good. What have you been up to?
Oh... not much... work and sleep take up most of my time. Try to squease in a movie here and there when I can though.
Pretty much the same for me. Seen any good movies lately?
Depends. Do you mean on video or in theaters?
Either. Dvd first I guess - always looking for recommendations for my collection.
In that case I've recently rewatched my favorite movies for the umpteenth time.
And they are....
Donnie Darko, Scott Pilgrim vs The World, Stardust, Warm Bodies, Southland Tales, Rushmore, and Jay & Silent Bob Strikes Back.
Oh! I LOVE Jay & Silent Bob Strikes Back! Did you hear about the sequel?
Of course. HUGE Kevin Smith fan.
Me too. My favorite two of his are Clerks, a true cinematic classic, and a tossup between Mallrats and Dogma.
Dogma is hilarious. It used to be the movie I used to introduce my friends to his works.
Used to? What do you use now?
For my more mature friends Clerks but otherwise Jay & Silent Bob Strike Back since it's modern, has an AMAZING cast, and it's absolute hilarious.
But what about me? You started me with Mallrats.
Dude, that movie is so us though.
Snoogins. Would you like a chocolate covered pretzel?
