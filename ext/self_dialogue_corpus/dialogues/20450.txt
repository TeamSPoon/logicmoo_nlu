What did you think was good about it?
I thought they did a good job with the casting.
Anyone in particular?
I thought everyone played their roles well.  I was particularly surprised by Bautista performance.
Was it a good performance.
I can't say he is a great actor, but he fit the role of Drax very well.
What else did you like about the move?
The humor in the film was well done.  It gave a light and fun tone to the move without be corny or over the top.

I thought they overused the 70's music.

It played into the plot as well as thematically, especially the song Father and Son by Cat Stevens.
That's a great song.  The movies sounds interesting.
