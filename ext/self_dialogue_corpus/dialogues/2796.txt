Tyreek Hill is such an exciting young player!
Did you see how many games he won for the Chiefs last season?
Oh I know he had so many good games. The most memorable ones were against the Broncos.
Didn't he score 3 touchdowns in that game?
Yes he did. He had a kick return for a touchdown, a rushing touchdown, and a receiving touchdown.
He's so electric when he's returning kicks and out in the open field.
It's his speed and quickness. The guy is lightening fast, strong and just knows how to get open!
I can't wait to see what he's going to do this season with the Chiefs.
I think the Chiefs are going to win 12 games and take the AFC West.
I think they'll finish with 11 or 12 wins but the Raiders will win that division.
Tyreek Hill needs more touches on the offense.
He's so explosive it would be a crime for Andy Reid their coach, to not put in more plays for him.
I think we'll see Tyreek featured in a lot of plays since they let Jamaal Charles go.
That's right! I forgot the Bronco's picked up Jamaal Charles.
That's a big pickup if Charles can stay healthy. He's too injury prone.
Demaryius Thomas and Jamaal Charles on the same team, that sounds exciting on paper.
If he Jamaal stays healthy it'll great for the Broncos.
Yes I agree. Their defense is top notch they just need their current offense to catch up.
It's going to come down to Trevor Siemian. If he steps up and improves the Denver Broncos will be dangerous next season.
I think he will improve. He looked good last season for his rookie year and I think he'll only get better.
