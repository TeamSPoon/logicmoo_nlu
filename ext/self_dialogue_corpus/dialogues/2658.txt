Hi Jerome, who is your favorite NFL player of all time?
Of all time?  Well, I would have to say that my favorite is Bill Bates.
I have never heard of Bill Bates, tell me about him.
He was a player for the Dallas Cowboys.
Interesting.  What position did he play?
He played safety and played on special teams.
Was he a star?
I wouldn't say that he was a star, but he always played his hardest.
That's cool.
Yeah, he was known for his gritty play and his hard hits.
Awesome, when did he play.
He played during the 80s and 90s.
Was he ever in the Pro Bowl?
Yeah, I think he was in it once.  He was the first ever special team pro bowl selection, if I am remembering correctly.
Nice!  What number did he wear?
He was number 40.  I have a jersey of his.
That's really cool, it sounds like you are really a fan of his.
I really am.  I would love to meet him.
That would be cool, what would you say to him?
I
