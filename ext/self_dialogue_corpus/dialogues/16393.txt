What happened to people making music videos?
I think once YouTube came onto the scene it changed music.
I remember how theater like they used to be.
I know its something I looked forward to.
Now it seems like bands just film videos of their concert.
And play the track in the background.
Yeah I mean it seems wasteful
I dont know I still just listen for the music
Oh for sure but sometimes a good video sticks.
Yeah but the main importance is making good music.
I think even bands with great followers cheat their fans.
How so?
By not making a music video.
I think you are in the minority on this one.
I dont think so, its important.
No as long as they tour fans are fine.
I guess I can see your point.
But I do wish MTV played music videos.
They havent done that in 20 years.
They mostly play the same reality shows nowadays.
