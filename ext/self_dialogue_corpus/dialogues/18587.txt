You listening to any good music right now?
Yeah. Have you ever heard of 311?
Aww? Yeah I used to listen to them in college. They still around?
Still around??? HAHA they just released a new album.
Really!? I loved Down. That was my favorite song that summer.
Dude you are way behind. They've had at least 4 albums since that one.
Wow! And they still got it?
I've liked every one.  And this new one is no different. It's called Mosaic.
That's cool. Do they still put on their big concert? They do it every two years.
Yes. 311 day. March 11th. I haven't been to one yet. Really trying to go.
I would like to check that out too.
We should plan it out. Save money and do it right.
I am definitely down for that.
They also do cruises. I did one of those. Expensive but so worth it.
Like a concert on a ship?
Like several concerts on the ship and on shore. Every day 4 to 5 shows. About 5 to 6 different bands.
That sounds insane.
It was one big party. I want to do another. But 311 day first.
Can you recommend an album for me to check out.
Either Mosaic or Stereolithic. Both awesome.
