Do you like rap music?
Some of it, yes. It depends.
Depends on what?
I don't like the kind of clubbing and drugs rap music around nowadays.
What kind of rap do you like?
Older rap, like Tupac, and modern rap like Kendrick Lamar and Run The Jewels.
Oh I love Run The Jewels! Have you heard their latest album?
'RTJ3'? Yes, I love it.
It's really political, which I like a lot.
That's one of the main reasons I like them and Kendrick, actually. They're not scared of getting political.
They call Donald Trump out by name on a few songs, I remember.
Exactly. And Killer Mike had that song 'Reagan' which was very critical.
Kendrick has gotten more political, too.
And, again, in my opinion his music is better for it.
It just adds a layer of depth to modern rap that people don't expect.
Or give credit for! There is some good rap around today with substance, but not much.
I agree with you - I'm sick of hearing rappers talk about drugs and women.
It just isn't why rap came about. It was supposed to be for the disenfranchised to get political.
Nice to see some people keeping that legacy going.
Of course, and with pride. Kendrick isn't ashamed to come from a poor part of LA, and I respect that a lot.
