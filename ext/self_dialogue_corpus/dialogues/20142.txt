I need to see the Notebook again.
That movie is amazing!
I agree, did you read the book?
Yes! The book was even more amazing.
I like the actors in the movie myself.
Who are they again?
Rachal Macadams and Ryan Gosling.
Oh yeah. She is a great actress!
I agree. I am thinking she played int he Vow also.
The movie with Channing Tatum?
Yes! great movie.
I read that book also.
There are so many good movies when it comes to love movies but the notebook is one of my favorites.
I agree, I could watch that movie over and over it never gets old.
I like how they are in the nursing home together.
Me too, but it is sad and bittersweet.
I agree but at least they died together.
I think it is awesome how they put that plot in there.
I would rate that movie a ten.
I would rate it off the charts. Hands down best romance movie ever!
