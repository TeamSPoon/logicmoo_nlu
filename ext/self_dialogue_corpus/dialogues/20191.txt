Did you see the Weiner documentary?
I don't think I have. Tell me about it.
It is about Anthony Weiner, the former Congressman from New York.
Oh, is he Human Abedin's husband?
Yep! Although I think they have since gotten divorced.
I think you are right. How was the documentary?
It was really, really good. It was filmed during his campaign for mayor of NYC.
Oh I remember that! It ended pretty badly, didn't it?
Yeah, he didn't do well in the election at all. The documentary ends on election night.
I will definitely have to see if its on Netflix.
For sure. Did you see Jackie last year?
Yes! I love Jackie Kennedy and I loved the movie.
So did I. Natalie Portman was great.
She really was. It is scary how similar they look.
There were so many good movies last year. I feel like Jackie didn't get the credit it deserved.
I agree. Who else was in Jackie?
Peter Sarsgaard and Greta Gerwig were also in it.
Oh that's right. Did Peter Sarsgaard play Robert Kennedy?
Yep! He was really good.
I think I may go re-watch Jackie. It was great.
