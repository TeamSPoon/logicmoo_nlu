What is you  favorite mid  90s  rap  act ?
I really liked  do  or  die  .
They  did  do  you want  to  ride   as a  track  right ?
And I  really like  the party feel of  that   track .
Did  they  do  anything  else  natable  ?
Not  really  they worked with some  younger    groups like  lyfe  and  black  star.
So  the  mentored  alot  of younger  rappers .
Yeah  the  game  did not  treat  them real  well.
Well  maybe  they will go on  tour  again  one   day
We can  hope so.
