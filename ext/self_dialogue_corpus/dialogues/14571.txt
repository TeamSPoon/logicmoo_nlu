Did you see the Spurs play the Rockets last night?
I sure did!  What a crazy game!
I can't believe that the Spurs won by almost 40 points.
Yeah, no one predicted that, especially since they were playing in Houston.
And the Spurs won without Kawhi Leonard or Tony Parker!!  Who would believe that?
I know, it's nuts!  And the Rockets just looked terrible.
James Hardin looked particularly bad.
Yeah, what was wrong with him?  He looked like he didn't want to even be there.
So many of the Spurs really stepped up their game.  I was really impressed!
I agree!  Patty Mills and and especially LaMarcus Aldridge were great!
I can't believe that the Spurs won the series!  My mind is still spinning!
I know!  It's so awesome!
Do you think that Kawhi will play in the game against Golden State on Sunday?
I don't know, his ankle seemed pretty bad the other night.
Do you think that the Spurs have any chance of winning the series against Golden State?
Unfortunately, no, I don't think they can.
Me neither.  Golden State is just too good.
Yeah, no one can beat Steph Curry and Kevin Durant.
Do you think that Golden State will win the championship then?
Yeah, I think they will face Cleveland in the finals and beat them.
