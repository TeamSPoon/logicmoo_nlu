Did you know that Fast and the Furious chronology was different from it's story chronology?
What do you mean by that?
Like the movies do not all go in order.
I had no idea about that.
Yea, there were 2 short films that were released, one bridges the gap between the first and the second and one the second and the fourth.
That is interesting, I had no idea.
Tokyo Drift was the third released but actually takes place after the sixth movie.
That is just strange, why would they do that.
They probably did not plan on the franchise lasting this long when they made the third.
They were definitely wrong about that.
