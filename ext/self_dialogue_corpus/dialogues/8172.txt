I just won a contest on the radio.  I had to sing a lyric from the Ed Sheeran Castle on the HIll son
Congrats but I do not like Sheeran, I prefer different music and artists.
I also tried to win Bruno Mars ticket
I have Bruno Mars' song Thats WHat I like as my ring tone.
What other pop songs are you into these days?
Lady Gaga is my female kick butt singer and performer
Lady Gaga?  I only listened to her once, when she sang at the Super Bowl.
She is awesome and I remember her amazingly crazy but unique costumes, such as arriving to an awards show in an egg.
Remember when I was in high school, pop music was NSYNC and Britney Spears.
I love the music of today, Ed Sheeran and Lady Gaga are amazingly unique.
