have you seen the wizkid "come closer" video with drake?
oyeah i did but drake wasn't on the video.
no way,i was eager to see it because of drake
nah he wasn't
maybe a pay back to wizkid for also not appearing on drake "one dance" video he featured on.
true that could be a possible reason.
still though overall i love the song.
yeah same here  drakes killed it.
wizkid also brought his afro pop flavor to it.
i don't really dig this afro pop stuff, seems most american artist are experimenting with it.
it does sound great though, noticed jedinna  sampled afro pop sound on his new single.
yeah  the "little bit more" song.
yeah right that song has afro pop all over it
it sure does and kinda sound good to be honest.
so  back to the wizkid video, any cameo appearance as i can't watch yet until i'm out of work.
nah no cameo from any notable artist, just wizkid and some couple hot girls.
swear drake appearance would have boost its acceptance .
hmm kinda, although already 6 million views in 24hours
6 million what?
yeah true, i was stunned as well.
