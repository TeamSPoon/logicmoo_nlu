Whats your take on Hayley Mills movies?
They're kind of a gas, aren't they?
I'll say.  Which one do you like best?
Disney's The Parent Trap.  So funny!
I liked that one too.  It was cool how they did the twin characters with I think split screens.
She was cute as a teen.
Poor thing, just trying to get her parents back together.
She meant well, but lots of shenanigans happened.
The story had a good ending.
Things got tied back together.
