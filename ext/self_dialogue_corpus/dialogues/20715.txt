Have you seen the movie Mother´s Day?
I did! I liked it very much. I was surprised.
Really? why though?
Normally those movies where they join or have different stories sometimes don´t come up good.
Oh really, I do like this types of movies. Have you seen Crash?
Of course! But this one is very different. This one is intense and so real.
Did you know it won the Oscar for Best Picture?
No kidding, I didn´t. Do you know who directed the movie.
Of course, it was Paul Haggis.
Very cool!. Who else was in the movie?
Sandra Bullock, Thandie Newton, Matt Dillon, Don Cheadle, Brendan Fraser, Ryan Phillipe, etc.
Of course! You are so right!
What was your favorite scene of the movie?
When they were about to kill the little girl and she survived and they all though it was a miracle, super touching moment.
It definitely deserved the Oscar. What other movies with lots of stories have you seen?
Oh I saw the one called Valentines Day.
Oh me too, this one I did not like, I thought it was very cliche and not very real, very fake story.
Why do you say that?
The main guy proposes to his girl friend, she says no and the same night he is kissing his best friend.
You are right, but I´ll recommend you another good movie of this type one that it´s called Love actually.
