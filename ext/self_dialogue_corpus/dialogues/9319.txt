What kind of music you are into?
hip hop for sure
why is that?
because they're ruthless and violent?
haha, that sounds like a legit reason
it still got good vibe at the same time, you like them?
yeah, I listen to them sometimes, I was just listening Guana yesterday when I was taking a shower
oh, that was a funny song
yes indeed
I should let that song go with my shower next time
