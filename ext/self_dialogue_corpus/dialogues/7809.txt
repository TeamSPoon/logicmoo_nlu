What do you think is better the first Dumbledore or the second?
Richard Harris was my favorite. The other guy was okay but Ian McKellan would have done a great job too.
You're just saying that because of his role in Lord of the Rings. He did have that Dumbledore quality.
Agreed but it's not that. His eyes twinkle in the way I imagine Dumbledore's would also.
Yeah, he could have easily pulled that off. Makes you wonder about the choice for Gilderoy Lockhart. I heard Hugh Jackman....
Yeah, he's just cheesy enough. I think he would have been better. Me too.
McGonnagal was a good choice.
Yeah, can't believe that is Grandmama from Downton Abbey!
I know but she still has that quality about her.
Yes, you definitely want to stay on her good side. She's great.
