Do you Like Judd Apatow movies?
Of course! I love Knocked Up. One of the best comedies ever.
I agree! Did you see This Is 40?
No, is it any good?
Yes, you should see it. It's totally on point if you have kids.
I saw Trainwreck -- wasn't that one of his too?
Yeah, that was good! Amy Schumer was great in it.
Did you know Judd Apatow was a writer for old Jim Carrey movies, like The Cable Guy?
Really? I assumed The 40-Year-Old Virgin was his first movie.
Nope, but that movie is also one of my favorites!
Paul Rudd and Seth Rogan have a really good bromance going in it, just like Knocked Up.
Yeah, and Steve Carrell is so good. Did you see him in Little Miss Sunshine?
No, what was that about?
He's like a suicidal uncle who goes on this journey for his niece's beauty pageant. It's pretty good.
Sounds kind of crazy!
It's pretty good, but not as good as Judd's movies though. Did you like Pineapple Express?
No, actually. I thought it was kind of terrible, and I felt bad for Rosie Perez.
Why?
Because, she was so good in Fearless and White Men Can't Jump. She was terrible in Pineapple Express.
Yeah, but she wasn't the main character. James Franco was funny in it!
