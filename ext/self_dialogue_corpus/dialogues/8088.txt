Do you ever listen to Beyonce?
She's incredible. I loved "Halo".
That's a great song. She has such a powerful voice.
I agree. Did you ever see the release she did called "Lemonade"?
That was the long video album, right?
Yes, I thought that was so creative.
I haven't watched it yet but I should.
It's really deep and personal lyrically.
That sounds great. I also like her upbeat stuff like "7/11".
That song is so much fun to dance along with.
