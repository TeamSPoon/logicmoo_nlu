I like pro football a lot. How do you suppose that enterprise is viable?
They set it up as a business in specific ways.
I'd be interested to know. Its kind of fascinating.
The NFL is set up as a business association. Its member teams finance it.
That's not so unusual then.
Up until 2015 the NFL operated as an unincorporated nonprofit.
What changed?
The NFL drew criticism from the public, largely about taxes.
Yeah I heard they still owe millions of dollars in backtaxes.
It was a big controversy. Some people looked at the business end of the NFL unfavorably.
So now they pay taxes.
And the executive officers are now paid undisclosed salaries.
Its a tradeoff I suppose.
There are three officers, plus coaches, players, and employees.
The commissioner is the one who is elected into office.
The big guy, so to speak.
He's the one who hires the other two officers.
The current commissioner is...who?
I think its still Roger Goodell.
For some reason I'm reminded of the Olympics right now.
