Jim Bolyes is playing tonight!
Ok, and??
Remember, he's been on a year hiatus.
Why?
He was injured in the left leg and needed to heal.
Wasn't he the running back?
He still is.
Ok.  Do you think he's ready?
Tonight is the big game to find out.
I think he'll do awesome.
Yeah, he's a strong competitor.
He had Tim Longs train him.
The world renown football trainer?
You've got it.
Well, he was in good hands.
Let's see if he holds up.
The game comes on at 8pm.
Ok great, I'll be there.
Alright, I'm putting on my Jim Bolyes jersey!
Ok, me too then!
