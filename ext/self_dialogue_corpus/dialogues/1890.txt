Any new rule changes for the NFL in 2017?
A fair few, yeah. For starters, regular season overtime is now only 10 minutes.
Really? Any reason for that one.
They cite player safety and the fact that only 26% or so of games the last few seasons had overtimes that went longer than that.
I guess that makes sense. But I do wonder if we'll see more tie games now.
I would imagine so, even if they are still relatively rare.
A bit cheeky to cite player safety as a reason for a rule change but not consider dropping Thursday Night Football.
I agree, but I bet those Thursday night games get them more money.
No doubt. Any other rule changes?
Yes, the best one! They are loosening up on penalties for on field celebrations!
Whoa. Does that mean touchdown dances are back?!
I hope so! There's still some restrictions - can't delay the game, mimic use of a weapon or be "too sexy" - but it's a good sign!
That is awesome. Maybe they will be able to lose the No Fun League moniker!
Group celebrations, using the ball as a prop and going to the ground to celebrate are the things that won't be penalized any more, specifically.
I am so glad. The touchdown dances were always a fun thing to watch.
Players got very creative with them. Think of how sad a place the world would be without the Ickey Shuffle.
I had completely forgotten about the Ickey Shuffle. I am not sure if I am thankful for the reminder or not, haha!
What would you consider the greatest touchdown celebration, if not the Ickey Shuffle?
Easy! The Lambeau Leap, of course.
Lambeau Leap isn't a dance, though, it's just a jump into the fans. Ickey Shuffle forever!
