Have you seen any of the previews for the new Cars movie?
Is that in 3D?
It is and i think I'm looking forward to it as much as My kids.
My family fell in love with the Cars Characters..
Really, who is your favorite?
Mater!!!! Larry the cable guy did an amazing job bringing him to life.
Fillmore Reminds me of a teacher I had in highschool.
I've heard the new movie Has a Bit of a darker twist to it.
Do you know what day it  comes out?
Fathers day, We are going to take the kids to the drive-in to see it!
