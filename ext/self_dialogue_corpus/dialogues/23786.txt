Hey, are you familiar with Okja?
Is that the Netflix movie that is coming out?
Yea, the one directed by Bong Joon Ho.
Yea, I have heard of it.  It looks interesting.
Do you know if that is getting released in theaters?
I would guess not, but I am not sure at all.
Yea, that makes sense, they have their own platform.
I look forward to watching it though, it comes out in 2 days.
I had no idea it was out so soon.
Yea, want to watch it together?
That would be great.
By the way, how do you like his other movies?
I have only seen The Host and Snowpiercer, I thought both were good.
I did not like Snowpiercer that much but The Host was great.
Snowpiercer is pretty over the top.
Yea, I was not expecting that kind of movie and ending.
The visuals are quite amazing though.
Yea, one of the most visually stunning films I have seen in a while.
Well, look forward to seeing you in a couple days.
Take care until then!
