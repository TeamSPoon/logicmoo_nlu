Do you think Andrew Luck will be prepared for the upcoming season.
I hope so.
His shoulder surgery was just recently.
I hope all the players are ready.
I hope the teams with new quarterbacks are prepared.
Yeah that is scary for the teams.
It is good though.
Yeah everyone deserves to play.
I think the NFL should make them aware that do not let hurt people play.
They do have rules like that.
Not everyone follows them.
I agree with that.
I am ready for football to start already.
Me too. It will soon.
I cannot wait to watch the Colts make it to the superbowl.
The patriots will beat them.
iI think some teams may surprise you.
I think the Cowboys are coming for it.
They have alot of fresh players and they are good.
They are strong too!
