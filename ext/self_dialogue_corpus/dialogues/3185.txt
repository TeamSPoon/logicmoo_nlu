How do you think the Cowboys will do this year?
I don't know, they were really good last year though.
They were!  I think they will finally make it to the Super Bowl again.
Really?  You sure are optimistic?
Why shouldn't I be?  Their core players are coming back, and they had a really good draft.
That's true, but I think their defense is lacking some.
Maybe, but their offense makes up for that.
Their offense is really potent.  Do you think Dak will have another good year?
I'm hoping so.  He had such a good rookie year.
He did, and so did Zeke!
I can't wait to see him with a year of experience.  He  is going to have a monster year!
I think so too.  What do you think their weakest position is?
I would have to say defensive line, but there is hope for them there too.
Interesting.  I don't see much hope there.
Well, they have some good positional players, and will have a good rotation.
That's an interesting perspective.
With some luck, they will stay injury free and do what needs to be done.
That's the key to most any team...stay injury free.
I agree.  I am so looking forward to the season.
Me too!
