Are you still listening to The Dead?
Funny you should ask.  I hadnt for a while but recently started listening a lot again.
I still think they are one of the best bands ever.
I agree, completely.  Its a joy to listen to them.
Even without Jerry?
I miss Jerry, of course, and most of what Im listening to are shows with him.
Me too, but I went to a Dead and Co. show last summer and was really impressed.
By John Mayer?  Lol
Laugh if you want but he crushed it.
I'm skeptical.
Everyone was skeptical.  You dont usually think John Mayer when it comes to the Grateful Dead.
For good reason.
Yeah, but I'm telling you he was great.  Pretty much everyone was blown away.
You're kidding.  OK, I'll have to check it out.
You'll be doing yourself a favor.
Maybe we can go to a show together this summer.
We should absolutely do that.
OK, I'll look into getting tickets.
Awesome.  We'll have a great time rocking out to Bobby, Phil, John and the boys.
Indeed.
