What are your thoughts on The Beatles?
I don't really have any thoughts. I'm indifferent to them.
You don't like any Beatles' songs?
I do like the song, "Hello Goodbye". They just have never appealed to me. I can understand the appreciation of them.
Yeah, they are one of the best bands of all time.
Baby boomers love them. I can see how they were ground breaking back in the day.
What do you mean back in the day? They're still relevant after decades.
I agree to some extent. Where do you start? I've heard all their hits and nothing really grabs me.
You should listen to Abbey Road.
Okay. I'll give it a listen.
