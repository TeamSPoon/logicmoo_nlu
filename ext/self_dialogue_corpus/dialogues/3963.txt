You know, Johnny Depp has a lot of thriller movies.
Really? I have only really seen his Tim Burton films.
Tim Burton is part of some.
What are his thrillers called?
Sweeney Todd is a fairly new one, have you seen it?
No, who else is in it?
Helen Bonham Carter.
Is is scary?
It is, both like suspense and thrills.
I love Johnny Depp in anything.
