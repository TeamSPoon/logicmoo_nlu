Are you a Tina Fey fan?
Oh I love Tina Fey!
Have you seen any of her movies?
Yeah, Sisters and Baby Mama.
Oh loved those! Sisters has an uncut version.
Yep. I'm sure that's totally appropriate.
I loved her in 30 Rock.  I just saw her in Whiskey Tango Foxtrot.
Oh yeah, that looked like a pretty funny movie.
It was.  She played a burned out journalist who requests a transfer to the Middle East.
Not the best place to be.  I'll bet the film had a lot of her gags.
That's true.  She does do a lot of physical comedy.
Did she write the script?
I don't know.  Seems like she would have.
She's talented in that department.
I think she was having a go at serious acting.
Good for her.
So along with the comic lines there were serious undertones.
Sounds like her.  Do you recommend the film?
Yeah it was pretty good.
I'll check it out then.
