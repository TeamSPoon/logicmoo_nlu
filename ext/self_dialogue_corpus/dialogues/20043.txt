Did you see that new Comedy, Why Him?
With the guy form breaking bad? No, was it funny?
Yeah, it was. Not as good as Crazy,Stupid Love, though.
Oh yeah that was similar and great, kind of like Love Actually.
I love that one. Did you see the one similar to that, Valentines Day?
No, I heard of it. Was it not just like, He's not that into you?
Similar. Made me miss old comedies, what is your favorite classic comedy?
Maybe, Ground Hog's Day. Is that a classic movie yet?
No, I do not think so. Mine would be The Frisco Kid.
A classic, another is Me, Myself and Irene
That is not a classic movie, but funny. Did you see the Truman show?
Yes, long time ago. Did you like the comedy the MAsk?
Of course! Gold, the sequel was awful.
They usually are. Like the sequel to the prequels of Star Wars.
No way man, I loved Episode two.
You are the only one. Did you like it better than the original trilogy?
No, let us not go that far man, I did like it. What was your favorite Star Wars?
Return of the Jedi, hands down. How about you?
Has to be... A new Hope, classic. Did you like Revenge of the Sith?
It was ok, good for the prequels.Did you?
