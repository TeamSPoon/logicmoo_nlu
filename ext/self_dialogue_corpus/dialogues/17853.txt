I have a question for you.
What is that?
How many albums does Michael Jackson have?
At least 10.
How many can you name?
At least three or four.
Which ones?
Thriller, Off The Wall, Bad, History.
Wow that's good.
Michael Jackson was that dude.
I wouldn't say all that.
Man you're crazy.
Michael Jackson was crazy.
Mike was the king of pop.
Yet that's true.
I like Remember The Time.
Me too.
We'll stop hating.
Ain't nobody hating.
Let Mike rest in peace.
