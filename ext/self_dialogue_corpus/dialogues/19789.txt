What channel are you listening to?
KGON - classic rock.
Oh, all right.  Good choice, they are playing some pretty good tunes.
Oh, yeah!  Been listening to them forever.  Before it was classic rock.
I like listening to a verity of music myself.
Me too, but mostly the old classics.
Don't they get old and kind of musty to you.  I mean, the same songs over and over?
Lol, no, there was a lot of music done back in the day so they've got a lot to choose from.
Well, I'm more into today's music I guess.  I like something fresh.
I got ya'.  There is some good new music out there but a lot of it is just noise to me.
Well, there's always been good and bad music I guess.  I like what they play on KISN. It's popular and the kids like it.
You know, I've seen some new acts lately watching Darrell's House on MTV.
I've caught that a few times. Where different songwriters and stars go to his house and jam with him.
Yeah, it's pretty cool.  He's something else the way he can work with just about anyone and any type of music.
I agree.  I wasn't much of a Hall and Oat's fan but his show is jamming.
I always liked them even though I listened to rock most of the time.
They were a bit to bubble gum for me back when I was in school.
But now that's the type of music you listen to.
Well, shows that age can change even your listening styles.
Or that having kids around all the time can change your listening style.
