You've seen Harry Potter right?
Yes I have why do you ask?
You know what my favorite part was?
What's that?
It was on the train when Harry Hermoine and Ron all meet.
Why is that the part you like the most.
It's meaningful and it's the start of a great friendship and many adventures to come plus it introduces us to the main characters nicely.
It was a pretty impactful seen that was well done.
Just something about the simplicity of it and looking back on it makes it shine like a diamond.
Now that you mention it that is one of the better happy moments.
