I love the Seattle Seahawks.
Are you just jumping on the bandwagon?!
No.  They're not even as popular as they were.  I just like the team.
Give me New England any day.
Now who's jumping on the bandwagon?
I've liked them for a few years.
Yeah, they've been popular and good for the last few years.
OK. Want me to go with Tampa Bay or Buffalo?
No. You can stick with the Patriots.  I'll stick with Seattle and we'll watch the other teams lose!
Good point!
Maybe we should go shopping for jerseys soon.
I've already got a few.  How about going to a game?
That would be great.
Who would you want to see?
Either one. I'd love to go to a pro football game.
How about if I check around and see what our options are?
Sounds good.  Of course, Seattle or New England would be preferred.
I know.
That would be awesome.  Let me know what you find out.
Sure will.
