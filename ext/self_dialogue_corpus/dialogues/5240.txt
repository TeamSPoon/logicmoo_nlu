Is there a Disney movie you don't like?
Only one! Fantasia.
I didn't like that one either.
My favorite movie is The Little Mermaid.
Disney is awesome. I love Ariel!
Do you like her better as a mermaid or human?
Mermaid of course!
She was a cute human though!
Yeah. I love her blue dress and big bow.
I do too!
