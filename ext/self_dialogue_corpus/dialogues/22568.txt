Have you ever seen that movie Rounders?
No, I have not ever seen that one before.
You have to watch it! It is one of my favorite movies ever.
My brother always talks about what a great film that it is.
I think you would really enjoy it if you watched it.
Who all plays in that movie that I would recognize?
Edward Norton and Matt Damon both do a great job in it.
Matt Damon is one of my favorite actors of all time.
Yea he is very talented; he really knows how to make a good movie.
He sure does! Have you ever seen Good Will Hunting?
Is that the one with Robin Williams in it as well?
Yes, they had great chemistry with one another.
I think I have seen that one actually. I remember really getting in to it.
What is your favorite movie from Damon?
I would have to go with The Bourne Identity movies.
I really enjoyed those as well! All of them were full of great action scenes.
Have you seen the newest one in the series?
Yes, I went to the movies and watched it when it first came out.
I think it may have been my favorite out of all the movies.
It is close for me with the original. Not sure which one I liked better!
