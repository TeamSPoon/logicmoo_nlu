Did you see the new Beauty and the Beast?
No, I didn't. Did you?
Yeah, I saw it with my mom.
Did you like it?
I did! The music was awesome, and Emma Watson did a great job.
She played Belle, right? She's a good actress.
Yeah, she was Belle. The Beast did a good job, too.
Cool! How was it having real actors and not cartoons?
I thought it made the story more realistic, which makes adults and kids like it.
That's fun! I hope they do more live-action Disney movies.
