What is the best game you ever played?
Hallway football.
Hallway football?
Yup.
Ok, I'll bite. What is Hallway Football?
Just like it sounds. It is football you play in the hallway.
What, like touch football?
No, like NFL football.  Full contact.
How do you fit 22 players in a hallway, along with referees?
No, no, not like that!  It was a one-on-one game between I and my brother, played in the hallway next to the living room of our house, on our knees, on shag rug, with a nerf ball.
That sounds crazy!
It was! One player would hike the ball, and then try to pus their way down the hallway toward the doorway on the other end, which was the goal line.
But where was your brother while you were crawling through the hallway?
On my back mostly!  We spent hours crawling, slamming each other into the walls, and landing on top of each other until the other couldn't move anymore.
Sounds brutal.
It was, and it was great!  And we imagined that we were our favorite players from our favorite NFL teams.
What were your teams?
I was the Stealers, and my brother was the Raiders. We were totally brutal!
Did you wear uniforms or helmets?
No, we just wore our play closes, and that was the year I wore out the knees on five pairs of jeans on the carpet. My brother and I loved the game, but my mother definitely did not!
