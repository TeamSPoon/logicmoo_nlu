I feel I need to vent a little, ok?
On what?
Well I am upset at Hollywood. I hate all the remakes they are producing.
I wish they had more original ideas, but some look so good.
Like what?
The new IT. I think it will be even better than the original.
That may be the exception. But most are poor imitations.
I did hear they are redoing Labyrinth.
Well at least that one is not a true remake. It is going to be more like a continuation.
How can you continue without bowie?
I agree. maybe they won't have the jaret character?
I heard James franco is involved.
I feel his stuff goes either way. Really good or awful.
Ya, he has been all over with the quality of his stuff.
Yes, especially some of his own directing/producing.
I have hope because he has been so good in some movies.
I do enjoy some of his lighter work too. Like pineapple express is pretty funny.
It is the ultimate stoner film, but great!
I was surprised I enjoyed that film as much as I did.
Me too. Rogen adds a lot to the movie.
