You ever watch the movie Scream?
Yeah, and the sequels
Cool, you know the movie has the right of it.
What do you mean?
I mean, that certain things always happen more or less the same way in most horror movies.
For instance?
Oh, like the confindent guy or the guy that doesn't believe in the kiler or monster is either the first or next to be killed.
Yeah, and if there is a basement or an attic, that's were the first victim gets it.
Also, the guy or gal who says " I'll be right back", is always the next to die, mutat, or get zombified.
True, plus anybody who has sex is fair game for the chopping blow.
