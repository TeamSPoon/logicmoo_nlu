The last time we talked you said you didn't like the old time Hollywood musicals like Singing in the Rain.
Yes, that's why I wasn't that impressed with La La Land.
Well, do you like any musicals?
Well, yes there are several.
O.K give me one--what's your favorite?
Well, I feel like I may betraying my male gender, but--Mama Mia.
Yeah, maybe more popular with women, but a solid choice.
I just love how all the ABBA songs propel the story line and are not just random.
And you like ABBA?
Yeah, I really do.
I guess it would be hard to enjoy the movie if you didn't like the songs.
Yeah, for sure, but there were other things.
I agree, for one, the beautiful scenery.
And the plot line--your child becoming an adult and moving on.
Yes, I cry when Meryl Streep sings "Slipping Through My Fingers".
Wait, you like the movie, too.
Yes, I confess.
Well, then you're crying when she sings "The Winner Takes It All".
Afraid you got me there, too.
Streep, is there anything that woman can't do.
