How do you feel about Janet Jackson?
I love Janet. I miss her music a lot, actually.
I miss when the Jacksons were basically the pop royally family.
I get that. The 1990s were really magical.
And the 1980s too, when Janet did Rhythm Nation.
And when Michael did Thriller and Bad, you know.
I hear Janet is going out on tour again soon.
Really? We should try to get tickets.
I hope she comes to our town and plays All For You.
I just wanna hear The Pleasure Principle.
