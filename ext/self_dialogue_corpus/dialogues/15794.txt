Hey, are you an Arcade Fire fan?
Wow, I haven't listened to them in years.
Really? What was the last album you heard?
The Suburbs.
Oh, that's the really popular one.
Yeah, I still like them I've just been bad about keeping up with it.
Yeah, sometimes it's hard to keep up with all the new stuff.
I know there's so much of it these days.
Anyways, you should hear the new single.
What's it called?
It's called, Everything Now. It's awesome.
I'll have to look it up when I go home then.
Yeah, they have that and another single that's more electronic.
Oh yeah, what's that called?
It's called, Creature Comfort.
I'll have to write these down in my phone.
Yeah because they're both really good.
Which one do you like better?
I like Everything Now better.
Okay, I'll give them both a listen then!
