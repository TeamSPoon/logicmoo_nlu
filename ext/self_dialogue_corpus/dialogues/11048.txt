Did you hear the Devils received the first pick in the NHL draft?
Yeah! Can you believe that?
I know right? And who received the second pick?
Philly. Everyone was shocked.
I wonder what kind of defense the Devils will have next year with a first round pick.
I'm not sure but they have to do something. Ever since they lost Larson they've struggled.
Well I heard they may get Kovelchuck when he comes back to the NHL.
Well I think he will be traded.
Who would they get for him?
I'm not sure. Hopefully someone to bring some defensive pressure.
That's going to be one tough division.
Yeah, the metro division will have a ton of strong teams.
Who do you think the best goalie will be in the divison next year?
I'd love to see Schneider have a great year.
I think Lundqvist will have a rough time. He is getting older.
I think he still has a few more years in him.
Well all I know is that they may have a tough time making the playoffs.
Well it depends if they lose Ranta.
I think they will hang on to him for another year.
We'll see. I think someone from the Metro division will be winning the cup.
