What is your favorite kind of music?
I love lots of different music but some of my favorite is Gospel.
I enjoy some Gospel too, who is your favorite artist?
I have several but one of them is Kirk Franklin, do you know who that is?
Yes he sings that song "Lean On Me."
Right! It's not a new song but it's a great one.
I like to listen to Gospel when I get ready for church on the weekends.
He has a wonderful voice and I enjoy his lyrics.
I completely agree with you there.
Do you remember who Fred Hammond is?
I think so, can you name one of his songs?
One of the best in my opinion is "Glory to Glory."
I remember that! It gets me excited as I'm getting ready in the morning.
It does me too! It's a great song.
I really enjoy Gospel music, it's a large majority of what I listen to.
I think I may try some new artists in Gospel.
That couldn't hurt. Another good artist is Pamela Mann.
Doesn't she play on some Tyler Perry show also?
Yes she does!
I thought her name sounded familiar.
