Have you seen the new Pirates of the Caribbean movie yet?
No! Don't spoil it for me!
I won't, but Johnny Depp was so good as Captain Jack.
I'm sure he was! I'm sad it's the last movie in the series.
I know, I really like those movies.
I haven't seen a longer running movie series by Disney in a long time.
What about Star Wars?
That doesn't count. That recently became Disney and they made all those movies before that.
That's true. Well maybe they will find something else to continue.
Well some movies you can only go so far without ruining it completely, so we will see.
