Are you looking forward to the next Star Wars movie?
A ton! It's so nice that they come out one a year now.
What are you looking forward to?
Well, we didn't get to see much of Luke in the last one. I'm hoping for more of him.
I really like Mark Hamill. I wish he was in more things.
He's always cast as the villain when he acts elsewhere. I'm excited to have him as a hero again!
But are we sure that Luke's a hero still?
He must be. He's Luke Skywalker.
Yeah. I guess that could never really change.
It definitely couldn't!
