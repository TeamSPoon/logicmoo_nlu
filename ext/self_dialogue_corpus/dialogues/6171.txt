What do you think of the older disney animation films?
Like how old? Original mickey mouse on the steamboat old?
I meant more the feature length films like snow white, cinderella, sleeping beauty era.
I like them still but they are very different form current ones.
Yes they are. They seem slower paced to me.
I think they may have been indeed. I like the music in them most.
That is something that is the same great scores from disney films.
So many iconic ones to be inspired by.
Well look even the soundbite Disney uses at the start of ilms is from pinnochio isn't it?
I think so... I believe it is, when you wish upon a star.
