Have you seen Moana yet?
No, not yet, but I really want to! I'm waiting for the DVD.
I couldn't wait to see it. I love Lin Manuel Miranda.
I do too. I also like movies with strong female heroines.
You'll definitely like Moana then.
I think I will. I heard there's no love interest. Is that true?
Yep!
Awesome! I'll make sure to look out for the DVD release.
Let me know when it comes out, we'll watch together.
Great!
