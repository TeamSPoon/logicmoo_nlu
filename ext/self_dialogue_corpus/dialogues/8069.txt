Have you heard the new song called Symphony by Clean Bandit?
I am not sure.
You probably would recognize it if you heard it.
Ok I can dig that.
It is a classic good track for our modern times.
What is so good about it?
A womans smooth and powerfully emotional voice with good instrumentals.
Oh is it a fast or slow song.
It picks up and goes quite fast but changes cadence at times.
I will have to listen to it, thank you for mentioning it.
