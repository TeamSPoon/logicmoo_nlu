Sometimes in the summer, when radio reception is good, I like to do what I used to do when i was a kid.
I'm afraid to ask. And what's a radio?
Late at night, during summer vacation, I would lie in bed with earphones and slowly tune the radio from end to end.
Trying to pick up far away, weird station?
Right. We lived in Los Angeles, and mostly you could get Texas stations and that's about as far away as you could get.
Lot of country music, I suppose.
Yes. Glen Campbell's "Wichita Lineman" had just come out. And Johnny Cash.
"Folsom Prison", "Man In Black", "A Boy Named Sue"? I remember those.
When I worked in northern Wisconsin, I had a 1979 Chevy Malibu with an antenna built into the WINDSHIELD.
It came from the factory like that? Could you hear any strange stations with that?
Yes, there was a tiny station in Manistique, Michigan, I think, WRPP. They came on at 4 am, with a ROOSTER crowing.
What music did they play?
That's just it. It was a tiny station with a wide variety of old, obscure records lying around.
They'd just reach over and grab something to fill the airtime?
Exactly, they were so square they were unbelievably hip and cutting edge. I'd never heard a lot of those sounds before.
What songs did they play?
I heard "Little Green Bag", "Talk, Talk", "My Little Red Book", "Paper Tiger". All kinds of obscure songs.
Go on. What else? I think "Paper Tiger" was a weird forgotten song from 1965.
They'd play "Beans In My Ears", probably the Serendipity Singers version, then a Sinatra song, then the 15 minute "Here Comes The Sun" by Richie Havens!
Sounds like a trip. I'd like to hear some old tapes from that station.
