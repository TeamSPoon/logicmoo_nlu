You know who's under rated in Star Wars?  The Emperor.
Oh I agree, he fooled the Jedi for decades undetected and destroyed them.
Yeah, that takes impressive skill.
Plus his fight against Yoda was totally epic.
Yeah it was.  They were toe to toe but he had the high ground on Yoda.
I've never been able to figure out if he lost on purpose to Mace or not.
I kind of think he did.  All that happening at the exact right time?
Yeah, way too much of a coincidence.
But at the same time, Mace Windu is no slouch.  Toying with him could be dangerous.
Yes it could be, but they took care of him in the end.
