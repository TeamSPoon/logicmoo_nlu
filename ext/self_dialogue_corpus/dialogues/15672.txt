what type of music do you like
I like several kinds, pop country oldies probably like you
yes those are my favorites as well
I love listening to oldes but now the radio calls the 80's oldies
yea I know to me it's still the 60's but I'll accept 70's as well
me too loved the bee bop
good stuff for sure, growing up in those years had some great music
our group of friends used to go to lots of concerts in the 70's
oh ya same here my favorite was the stones saw them a couple of times
I didn't see them until the late 80's but they were great
I got into country music in the mid 90's
that's about when I started listening to country, shania twain was my fav
oh for sure I saw her a couple times
ya what country fan didn't see her she is fantastic, I like rebba too
yup on rebba there are so many good singers in the country world
yes there are and country has really changed since the earlier days a lot of it is almost pop
agreed old time was more twangy country western style
yes Johnny cash, merle hargat and others
I like todays stye much better it's more entertaining
yes and it's more upbeat and gets you singing out loud
