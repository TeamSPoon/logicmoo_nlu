Any thoughtse on how you think the 49ers will do this year?
Well, they couldn't do much worse than last year.
Last year was terrible.
I know. Only two wins and fourteen losses.
Who did they beat?
Both times they won against the Rams.
The Rams must be a really bad team.
Actually, they had more wins last season than the 49ers did.
Maybe they need to get a new coach.
They did get a new one for this year.
Who is it?
His name is Kyle Shanahan.
Well, maybe he can turn the team around.
I hope so. It's not even that fun watching them anymore.
I know. I mean what's the point of watching if you know they're going to lose?
I'm going to give this season a chance and see if the new coach makes a difference.
I'll check out the first couple of games, too.
It would be great if they get back to being the winning type of team they used to be.
Well it won't be long until we find out.
So we should watch the first game together.
