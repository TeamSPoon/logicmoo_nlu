I'm looking for a good musical to watch. Any suggestions?
Have you seen Mamma Mia?
No, I haven't. Any good?
Oh yeah, it's one of my favorites!
Who is in it?
Meryl Streep, Pierce Brosnan, Amanda Seyfried, Christine Baranski...
That's an interesting cast. What's it about?
Amanda is getting married and wants her dad at her wedding, but doesn't know who he is.
Is it a drama?
No, not really. It's silly and fun with really good music.
What else is involved?
Well she invite three potential men to the wedding without her mothers knowledge to see of she can figure out which is her father.
Cool. And is Meryl the mother then?
Yes. And all the music is from ABBA.
I like ABBA a lot.
You will love this film then. Everyone is so good.
Can they all sing?
Surprisingly, yes! Some better than others, but all are good.
I think I will rent it then, thank you!
No problem. Enjoy!
