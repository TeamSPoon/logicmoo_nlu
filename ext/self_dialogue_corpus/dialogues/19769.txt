What are you listening to?
Just some Beck. He's one of my favorites.
Oh, yeah, I like him, too. Which album is this?
This is Midnite Vultures. One of his best, I think.
Is this song called Sexx Laws?
It is. It's so catchy.
Definitely. What are some of the other songs on this?
Well, let's see. Mixed Bizness, Nicotine & Gravy...
Is Hollywood Freaks on it?
Yes. My number one is probably Get Real Paid.
Right, right. Good one, too.
They're all super catchy songs. He's always good with the hooks.
Definitely. I liked him from Loser onwards.
Yeah, Loser is such a classic. First time I heard that, I was like, Oh yeah, this is great.
I know. So funny and sarcastic and self-aware.
Yup. Good thing he made a lot of music, though. Otherwise that's all he'd be known for.
And it's not really who he is. A "loser," I mean.
Exactly. Just a character he was playing.
He's a cutie, too. You think he's cute?
Are you kidding? SO cute.
