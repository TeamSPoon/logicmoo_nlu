I really like the band Labyrinth Ear.
I've never heard of them before.
They are an indie band that makes electronic music.
Cool. I always love discovering indie bands.
Me too. Have you heard of the band MeteorEYES?
No. Are they another indie band?
Yep, you should check them out.
Okay, I will.
Alright, enough of indie bands. What's your favorite well-known band?
I really like Five Finger Death Punch.
That's a metal band, right?
That's right. Do you know any of their songs?
I think I've heard Got Your Six before.
Oh, that's one of their best songs. Did you like it?
Yeah, I thought it was pretty good.
You should definitely check out their older songs.
Okay. Any in particular you would recommend?
Yeah, you should listen to White Knuckles, Wrecking Ball, and Bad Company.
Okay. Are there any other metal bands you would recommend?
You should check out Seether.
