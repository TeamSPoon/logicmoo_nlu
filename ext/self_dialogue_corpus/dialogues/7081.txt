Have you seen the new Cars movie?
Yeah, you mean the 3rd installment
Yup, Really liked it. The introduction of new characters, the retiring of old ones.
Hmmm. Yeah i wonder if its time to retire the franchise though.
Whaaaaaat!!! No No No. There is still much more to see. Like how did McQueen start, where did he come from etc?
True, maybe what i mean is for Disney to do a reboot. I really however did like the new cars in Cars 3.
Yeah, all Tech No heart is what i say.
But you have to admit the entrance of that new guy left everybody stumped. What's his name again.
STORM! Yeah burst on the scene like nothing anyone expected futuristic car, fast and almost unstoppable.
Don't forget the scene with the demolition derby. For sure i thought something dramatic was going to happen.
