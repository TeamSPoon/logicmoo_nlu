I know James Bond movies were a hit but I never liked them at all.
Really, I did , thought they were really good.
I just could not get into them.
How about Goldfinger now that was a good movie.
I saw it but was not impressed.
I loved them.
I know they were based on the novels by Ian Fleming.
Yes they were.
The movie company had to buy the rights to the novels .
I did not know that.
Sean COnnery was the original James Bond.
I think he did about six of the movies including From Russia with Love and GOldfinger.
I know there have been a few different actors that played Bond.
Yes , the last Bond movie came out in 2015.
It was called SPectre.
Daniel Craig played Bond in that one.
WHo else played Bond?
Timothy Dalton and Pierce Bronson both did.
Oh and Roger Moore.
And David Niven.
