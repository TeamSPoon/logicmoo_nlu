I am looking for a good music documentary to watch, seen any?
I always enjoy watching Eight days a week, a beatles documentary.
Is that the ron howard film?
Yes they go into the background of the beatles and their tours.
Ya  it is good, but have seen it. Any others?
Well have you seen searching for sugarman?
No what is it about?
Well I hate to spoil it for you  so I will be vague. A musician and twist of fate.
Intriguing.. so mysterious
I would say more but it would be like someone spoiling sixth sense for you, in my opinion.
Fair enough. Where can I find it online?
I know it was on netflix for a while, just search I am sure you can find a copy somehow. Do  you have any suggestions yourself?
Well I really was engrossed by gypsy caravan. I think that is the title.  Follows a bunch of different clans of musician gypsy's.
I think I have seen it. It was really good.
There is so much passion in the music and the voice of the one old lady is so incredible.
Ya  I am always moved when I hear that style. Have you seen the movie HANNAH?
No, What is it about gypsy's?
No not really, based around a girl mainly. But there is one seen that features gypsy music I found that scene very moving.
I will have to check that out too. Thanks.
No problem. Always glad to share my musical taste and thoughts.
