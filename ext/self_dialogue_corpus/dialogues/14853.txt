What is your favorite comedy film?
I would say Ground hog's day.
That is an oldie but a goodie. Got to love bill murray.
It is such a well formatted movie. So much went into the thought process of the film.
It is interesting how he develops over time and learns all these new skills.
I love movie that deal with time. So interesting. Also bill murray is great.
His performance is so on the money. I also think andie macdowell made this film too.
Don't forget about chris elliot too, he is a comedic genius as well.
