Is Chewbacca an iconic character?
Yes even without his dialogue.
I always fashioned him as comedic relief.
No way thats misguided.
I dont see how, I think he was crucial but not important
That seems like an oxymoron.
In The Empire Strikes Back I think he was important
OK so how do you feel about anything else?
I think he could have been played better
Thats a proposition I dont want to hear about it
