Would you like to watch Under the Tuscan Sun?
I love that movie.  I have seen it several times.
It is my all time favorite movie.  I watch it probably once a year.
Diane Lane is the perfect Frances.  I would love to watch it again.
Yes she is.  It is such a touching and simple movie, but it is very moving.
What is your favorite scene?
That's tough; I like so many of them.  One of my favorites is when Frances has to ride out the bad thunderstorm alone in her new villa.
Yes, when the washing machine is hit by lightning and then the owl flies in are pretty funny.  It's comic relief in the midst of the drama.
I also really like it when Frances collapses on the floor in her new apartment.  She just gives up.
I think we have all felt that way.  But she is able to pick herself back up and go on.
Sandra Oh as Patti is enjoyable too.  She becomes the family that Frances needs.
Yes, I really like it when Martini, the realtor, tells Frances that she got everything she wished for.
I love that part.  She did wish for a family and a wedding, and she got those.
They weren't necessarily hers, but I think the movie showed that you can make a life and family for yourself even if you don't have blood relatives.
I love the part when Pawel, played by Pawel Szajda, wants to marry the neighbor girl, and Frances tells her parents that she is Pawel's family.
That is a great storyline.  All of the Polish men working on her house become her family.
Yes, as do her other neighbors.
The whole theme of making your own family is very moving.
Did you know that the movie is based on a travel book written by Frances Mayes?
Yes, the main character is loosely based on her life.  But the book is more like a travelogue and doesn't closely align with the movie.
