Did you rather Ludicris as a rapper or an actor?
I actually didn't see a lot of his acting, but he was one of my favorite rappers.
You really liked his rapping?
Yeah, he really had a good flow, and he had a ton of good songs.
I remember hearing a lot of them on the radio, but I never had any of his albums.
I had a few, and they were all extremely awesome.
Do you wish he would come back to rapping?
Oh, definately.  Even if it was just for a couple songs.
Or to guest appear on someone else's stuff?
I'd rather him have his own album.
