Did you know Chris Cornell from Soundgarden just recently died.
Yeah I heard about that, that was pretty sad.
He had such a good voice. I loved Audioslave too.
I like their song Like a Stone. That never gets old.
I like that one and also I am The Highway.
That's a cool song. Soundgarden is probably most famous for Black Hole Sun.
Right and especially with how crazy the video was. Very memorable.
That's true. I loved grunge when it was in its heyday.
Yeah Soundgarden was right up there on the heels of Nirvana and Pearl Jam.
I love Nirvana. Smells LIke Teen Spirit is a classic.
I love that one and also Lithium. Kurt Cobain was a genius.
Yes it's a shame he died. So many good rockers died young.
Right like Janis Joplin, Jim Morrison, Jimi Hendrix, Amy Winehouse
All great artists. Did you ever like Amy Winehouse?
I like a few songs from her like Rehab and You Sent Me Flying.
She did have a great and unique voice. I hate that she was put down so much in the media.
Yeah me too. My boyfriend loves Jimi Hendrix.
So do I. My favorite song by him is Hey Joe.
Oh that's definitely one of my favorites. Are you into Classic Rock?
I am but I'd have to say Led Zeppelin is my favorite band from that era.
