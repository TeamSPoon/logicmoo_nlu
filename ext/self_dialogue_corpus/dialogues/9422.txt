Who do you think is the greatest rapper?
I think it's Eminem.
You don't think it's Tupac, Biggie or Jay-Z?
I think they are all good, but I think Eminem is better.
I think Biggie is overrated.
I think he was pretty good but I think Tupac was better.
Tupac actually had a deeper writing style.
Yeah, but he still rapped about weed and girls.
I just realized Eminem doesn't rap alot about girls and weed.
That's why I think he's the greatest of all time.
