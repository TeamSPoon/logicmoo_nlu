Out of the all three of Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy, which one do you feel was the strongest?
By far, I'd have to go with The Dark Knight from 2008. What about you?
I completely agree, honestly. Heath Ledger's Joker completely blow people away, in my opinion, and stole the show.
Oh, definitely. I can remember reading the negative feedback online feedback when he was announced to play the role.
Same here, and I too went it to the movie back in 2008 pretty skeptical.
Did your mindset change at all after seeing the first teaser and hearing his infamous laugh for the first time?
Honestly, no, not really. It wasn't until the very first actual trailer, where we got to actually see his Joker, when I really warmed up.
I'll buy that, since I can't help but agree. That first trailer was simply amazing.
Thinking of the Joker specifically, what do you think was his best scene in that movie?
Very good question. As far as a general performance standpoint, I loved the scene at the jailhouse where Batman integrates him.
Yes, that scene is definitely up there for me, as well.
I feel as if that was the scene where Heath Ledger really captured The Joker.
Once again, you make another valid point. Batman just beating on him and Joker sadistically laughing was great storytelling.
Not just that, but Heath Ledger's acting was also completely on point. Just an amazing scene.
I agree. Does any other Joker scene standout to you from the movie?
I also loved the part where he crashes the party and tells Rachel his story of his wife. Another amazing acting performance.
Yes! That scene also stood out to me quite a bit and there is also a fair amount of humor in it, as well.
That's what helped make Ledger's Joker so amazing. He thru in some humor on top of the psychotic Joker character.
So, you feel he surly earned his Oscar?
Absolutely. He did amazing things for that character.
