You ready for another football season?
Definatly ready to watch the Patriots lose.
I hope i am so tired of Tom Brady.
He is to old to even be playing anymore and Bill Belichick the coach needs to go
I so agree with that
I really would like to see the Steelers and Ben Rothensberger win another superbowl.
I would like that out come.
Hey do you know why they have the Terrible towl or what it is for?
Yes it was created by Myron Cope in 1975 for the playoffs.
So they have had a Terrible Towl that long?
Yes they have and true Steelers fans protect those towels with their lives.
One year A group of Ravens fan were stomping on the Terrible Towls and their was a huge fight.
Wow i do remember hearing that one on the news the Ravens won by a hair.
Yes they did win but not the fight over the Terrible Towl.
So do you root for any other team besides the Steelers?
Yes I root for them But my Husband is a Saints fan.
Another quarterback that has seen bettter days.
Yes Drew Brees is still ok but hes getting to old for the game.
He is always complaining about something durning a game.
Yes and nothing is ever his fault.
