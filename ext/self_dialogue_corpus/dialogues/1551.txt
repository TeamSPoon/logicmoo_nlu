do you like tampa bay this year?
you mean the bucs?
yeah.
i like them.
i think they might be strong enough to win that division.
me too. i think the falcons will step back.
shoot, i think atlanta will pull a carolina.
what you mean?
i think they don't even make the playoffs.
i know right.
last season was their chance and they blew it.
my money was on the patriots.
you know you got lucky right?
luck ain't have nothing to do with it.
falcons just totally fell apart.
i knew once the patriots cut it to eight that they would pull it out.
biggest choke job in super bowl history.
i know right.
i never did like the falcons.
i liked them when they had michael vick.
