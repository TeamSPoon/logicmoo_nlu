What is your favorite Star Wars movie?
Good question, I would have to say return of the Jedi. What about you?
I would have to agree, return if the Jedi had a little bit of everything.
Yes it did, the original three were the best storie lines, although the recent ones have been very good also.
Yes, the force awakens blew me away, it was s good. Apart from the fact Han Solo dies.
I was suprised by that too. He was always one of my favorite characters.
I have a feeling he will come back somehow.
Thatâ€™s hopeful, but I could see it happening. They are trying to be original with the new movies.
Yes, like them both dieting at the end of rogue one.
I was suprised by that, I read the book so I knew it was going to happen but I hoped that they would change it.
