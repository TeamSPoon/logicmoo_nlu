I honestly have never seen Pulp Fiction.
Really? No way.
Yep. Not even once.
So you don't understand any of the references I've ever made?
What do you mean?
I've always called a Quarter Pounder a "Royale with Cheese" for example.
I thought you were French Canadian.
I'm from Minnesota, Burt.
You're the one that never lets me know it's a reference.
Well you don't wanna be obnoxious with it.
How could you be obnoxious making a fan reference?
You could punctuate every single reference with "get that reference?"
I have some friends that do that sometimes.
Exactly and what does it result in, usually?
An awkward moment--even if anyone does.
Even if someone does understand the reference, they have to either acknowledge it and play along. Or they have to respond like "Yeah. I get it."
That sounds painful.
It's even worse when you involve alcohol into the mix.
I wouldn't recommend you going to a film festival.
I loathe them.
