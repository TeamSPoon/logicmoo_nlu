Been to any good concerts lately?
Not really, but I see Kid Rock is coming to town end of the summer.
Oh I love Kid Rock!  His concerts are incredible.
Yeah they are.  I went to one once where he flew in Run DMC as a surprise!
That's incredible!  I love Run DMC!
What other artists do you like?
I like just about everything. I really like Florida Georgia Line.
They're good but their concert tickets are so hard to get!
I know I've tried!  I really like Garth Brooks too.
He's a classic!
Have you ever seen any of the big rock bands?
I saw Poison once.
I bet they put on a great show!  I would give anything to see ACDC or Guns N Roses!
I saw Guns N Roses when I was a teen.  They are very good!
So what was the best concert you've ever been to?
Oh definitely the Guns N Roses concert.  You?
That's tought....Kid Rock was awesome, but I also saw Nickleback a few years ago and their drummer put on a heck of a show!
I have heard they have great shows.
They do.  They had a huge pyrotechnic display and their music is pretty good too!
I do like their music.
