Did you see any of the movies nominated for an oscar for best picture 2017?
A couple of them... did you?
Not before the academy awards, but afterwards I saw four of them.
So which ones did you see?
LaLa Land; Hidden Figures; Fences; and Lion.
Which one did you like best?
Hard to say, but I think Hidden Figures.
So why that one?
I like movies based on historical facts. Good narrative, interesting characters and well acted.
So what did you think about the other three you saw?
They were all close to favorites. LaLa Land was just fun; Lion was really interesting, and I liked Fences but it was dark and depressing.
Yeah, I agree. I saw LaLa Land and Fences...how's that for two pretty opposite movies?
LOL... true enough. Are you going to see any others?
Well, I think I will see the other two you saw, since it seems like a recommendation. How about you?
For sure I will see Arrival; and maybe Manchester by the Sea. That's it.
Well, let me know. Maybe we can go together.
Ha ha, I'll be renting them through NetFlix.
Alright then, have me over to watch. I'll bring the popcorn.
Ok, I'll probably get Arrival. I think Manchester is pretty heavy and depressing.
Ok, it's a date. Call me when you get it.
