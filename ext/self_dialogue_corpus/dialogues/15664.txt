I've been listening to a lot of Adele lately.
Oh really? How come? Were you just in the mood?
Yes, I was because Adele sings the best love songs on the planet.
I agree! Which one's are your favorite?
So many! I would have to say Hello and Someone Like You.
I love those songs too! But they're so sad.
That's true. But she has sung plenty of uptempo, happy songs too.
Oh really? I didn't know that. Like what for example?
Send My Love is a fun song, for example.
I could be wrong, but isn't that also about heartbreak?
Well, sure. But it's also about moving on and forgiveness.
I agree. It doesn't sound like a melancholy ballad.
I have to add that I also find Adele's music very inspiring. It's made a huge impact on me.
I think she's a great role-model too.
Yes, I would agree. Which is your favorite album by Adele?
I would say 21, and I also love a few songs I've listened to from 25.
Do you think Adele will stay true to her roots in future albums?
Well, she may considering how successful it's been for her. But I also fee her music is from the heart.
I couldn't agree more. I'd love to see Adele experimenting and doing something different.
Sure, but I would still buy any record she comes out with.
