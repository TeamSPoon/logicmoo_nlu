Have you seen the video for Lady Gaga's The Cure?
I haven't. Where can I watch it?
It's on Youtube.
What else should I watch of hers?
Million Reasons is a great video
I like watching live concerts.
Oh there is a video of her doing Bad Romance in Sydney
Is it any good?
Oh it's amazing.
I'll watch that after Applause.
