Can you believe Harden's beard and hair do?
I know, he looks like a point guard turned mountain man.
I think the Spurs are good enough to make it to the finals at least.
Keep wishing.  They are flimsy and prone to injuries.
The Lakers have a deep bench and will win it all.
I don't think so.  They don't work well as a team.  Too many showboats and not enough team work.
Do you see westbrooks little breakdown on the court after he was called for a foul?
I did.  It was quite a hissy fit considering he did commit the foul.
I think the may be Durant's last year.  He doesn't shine like he used to.
Nah.  He scored like 22 point last game.  There is plenty of life left in him.
Are the Thunder and Bulls ever going to play again?
I don't know but if they do I have it's in Chicago.  I may be able to get tickets.
I can't believe Curry fouled out.  He never does that!
I know, it's like the ref's had him under a microscope.
I think the Knicks should just hang it up.  They can't win for losing.
It ain't over, they just need to jell as a team.  They'll get there.
I'm going to record the Cavaliers tonight.  Don't tell me about it until I watch it!
Spoiler alert eh?  Should be a good game.  You better watch it ASAP.
Where is Dwight Howard from?  I'd never heard of him until the NBA.
He played for the  Southwest Atlanta Christian Academy.  He was an unknown until the NBA snapped him up.
