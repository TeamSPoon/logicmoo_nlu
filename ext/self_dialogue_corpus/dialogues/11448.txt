Who was a better song writer, Lennon or McCarthy
That is the $64,000 question.  And it is really hard to answer
I think it was John Lennon
What makes it hard to answer was an agreement that McCarthy and Lennon made early in their collaboration.
They had an agreement?
They said no matter who wrote the most of or the least of a song, the song would only be credited as written by Lennon and McCarthy
So how can you tell who wrote it.
In the early years it was probably a fair share collaboration between the two
In later years, especially when the songs where big hits, like Yesterday and Imagine, each got their own credit.
I still think John Lennon was the best composer.  I really liked the Ballad of John and Yoko
