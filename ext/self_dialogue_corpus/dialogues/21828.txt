You've seen the Lord of the Rings trilogy, right?
No, I haven't.
You really should. All three of the movies are amazing!
Really? I don't know much about them.
Oh, so you've never read the books?
No. Are they good?
I like them, though the movies are easier to follow. Peter Jackson did a great job.
Is he the lead?
No, he's the director. He does have brief cameos in all three of the films though.
What actors are in the movies? Anyone I might recognize?
Elijah Wood, Orlando Bloom, Viggo Mortensen, Liv Tyler, Cate Blanchett
I like Orlando Bloom! He was great in the Pirates of the Caribbean movies.
He's great in Lord of the Rings, too.
Really? Does he have a big part?
Oh yeah. He's one of the nine members of the Fellowship.
I'm not sure what that means.
Well, there are nine characters who go on a quest to destroy an evil ring.
Does Cate Blanchett's character go on the quest, too? I liked her in the movie Elizabeth.
No, she's not a member of the Fellowship, but she's still an important character. She helps the others on their journey.
That's really cool. Maybe I should rent the movies this weekend.
