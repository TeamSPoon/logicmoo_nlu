Have you seen the new space movie that came out recently?
There are so many space movies, which one?
The movie called "life"
I have not seen it yet.
It is pretty good.  You should check it out.
Whats it about?
It is about a group of astronaughts at a space station.  They have life they found on mars.
Sounds typical, what happens?
They are studying it and piss it off. Then it kills them all.
Interesting, what does the life look like.
It looks like a big jelly fish when it grows.
It grows?
Yeah it gets bigger as it eats the atronaughts.
Oh that gnarly.
The ending is not what you would expect either.
Were you shocked?
My jaw dropped, but that is all I can say without ruining it for you.
You might have already said too much.
You still wont expect the ending.
I go see it soon.
