Have you seen Deadpool yet?
Not yet.  How was it?
Pretty darn funny.  A bit crude though.
Well, it's rated R I believe.
Oh yeah, a well-deserved R.  It's violent and full of strong language.
So you're saying I shouldn't take my daughter?
Of course not.  She's got another ten years before she should see it.
I don't think I can wait that long.
Want to borrow my copy?
Sure.  Something for family movie night, eh?
