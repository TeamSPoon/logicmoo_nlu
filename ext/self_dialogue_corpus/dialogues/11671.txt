You remember that rumor that Paul was dead?
Yeah. Supposedly he was replaced by a double.
Ridiculous. At that time, the early sixties, stuff was hard to refute to the fans..
Let's see, the left foot right foot "evidence".
Yes. The double was just for show and George Martin wrotw the "Paul" songs.
How about the one that some song actually had the phrase "Paul is dead"
I don't remember the song, but yes.
Long time ago, I tried that. It was a vinyl disc.
Was it true?
I can't say it sounded like what people describe.
