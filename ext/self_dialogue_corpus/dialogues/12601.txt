What is your favorite part of the Star Wars soundtrack?
I like Yoda and Leia's theme - overall The Empire Strikes Back music is the best.
Some people like the prequel music too - like Dual of the Fates from The Phantom Menace.
Yeah, that's great, as is the lightsaber dual with Darth Maul.
Yeah, that was a high point of the movie between Obi-wan and Qui-gon.
Indeed, I don't know if the lightsaber dual of that movie will ever be topped.
I wonder if Luke and Kylo will have a big shown down in The Last Jedi?
Possibly - or maybe they will save it for Episode IX.
I think Disney has their work cut out for them - so many people love Star Wars!
As long as they create a great story around Skywalker, I think it will work.
