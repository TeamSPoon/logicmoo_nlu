what do you think of nick jonas?
I think he is just okay.
What about his jealous song that was a huge hit.
I did enjoy that one of his. But what is up with all the girlfriends in videos these days?
What other ones are you talking about?
Well kanye putting kim in the one on the bike then the bed one with tons of celebs.
I think putting your girlfriend in the video had been going for a long time.
I guess I would appreciate it if it were me. But look nick jonas and that model broke up, awkward video now.
I don't know if it is awkward,maybe only because of the lyrics.
Ya a little ironic or makes you wonder is that why you broke up, jealousy issues?
