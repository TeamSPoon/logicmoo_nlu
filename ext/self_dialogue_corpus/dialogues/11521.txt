Have you ever heard of Stu Sutcliffe?
Sounds familiar.  Who is he?
He was in the Beatles.
Wait, I've never heard that name in the Beatles.
Well, he was in the band before it was popular.
What instrument did he play?
He played the guitar.
Was he kicked out?
No, he actually quit, but I think he died at a young age.
Wow, that's pretty tragic.
