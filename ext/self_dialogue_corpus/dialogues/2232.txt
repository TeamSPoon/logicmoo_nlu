So who do you think will be the NFL's top rookie this year?
Wow, that's tough to say. After all, who thought Dak prescott would do anything at this time last year?
True, but I have to think Leonard Fournette will do great things in Jacksonville.
That's probably right. They'll lean heavily on him with Blake Bortles being so mediocre.
They will. And Christian McCaffrey should put up some good numbers in Carolina.
Yeah, as a runner and receiver, he should get a lot of touches from Cam Newton this year.
Yep. And while QBs are hard to predict, I have to think Deshaun Watson will put up some good numbers in Houston.
Yeah, they were a mediocre division winner last year, but they were a winner, and joning a winner is always easier for a rookie.
He has to beat out Tom Savage, but that shouldn't be hard.
Nope, and he brings a level of mobility there they've never had at quarterback.
Dalvin Cook should get a lot of touches in Minnesota.
The Vikings thought enough of him to unload Adrian Peterson, so that's probably right.
And what about run-stoppers? Myles Garrett was the top overall pick, and he should help Cleveland's defense improve immediately.
Yeah, but the rest of that defense is so bad it may overshadow him.
Haason Reddick joins a decent Arizona defense and should make their linebacking corps a lot better.
Same could be said for Malik Hooker, anthough he comes into a Colts secondary that got beat up last year.
Jamal Adams may be a better safety, but he comes into an even worse situation with the Jets.
Yeah, they may get torched so much this year his play will be rendered moot.
I wouldn't rule out Derek Barnett, either.
Yeah, the Eagles weren't horrible last year, and with him at defensive end they can only get better.
