Hey did you see Peter Jackson's new Hobbit films?
Of course I did.
Okay remember the attractive dwarf who fell in love with an elf? What was his name?
I know it was Kili or Fili. I think Kili.
That sounds right. That's the one that had a relationship with Evangeline Lilly right?
I think so. Do you mean that elf who is played by that girl from the show Lost?
Yes her. Ok, so his name is Kili, got it.
Why do you want to know?
Oh I was just thinking about the film, and trying to figure out that actually happened in the book.
I'm almost certain it didn't. I think they even invented that character, because there are very few female characters in Tolkien's work.
That explains a lot. Well Peter Jackson took a lot of liberties with Lord of the Rings as well.
He did, but I think it made for some better films overall, don't you?
Oh definitely, like when the Ents refused to go to war until the hobbits tricked them into seeing the devastation that Isengard had caused.
Oh right! That was such a powerful scene!
Oh definitely, I will never forget the bellowing noise they made.
The cinematics in special effects in that scene were insane!
Oh I know, do you remember when they broke the dam and flooded the entire plain?
Yes! And then that ent puts his leaves in it to extinguish fire!
The whole thing was awesome really.
Yeah they did an amazing job with such long books.
