I'm so tired, I went to see Otep last night and it wasn't over until almost midnight.
Otep. Who is that?
It's metal, I first saw her in 2002 at Ozzfest and I've followed her since.
Yeah, I don't know that I know her. What does she sing?
Last night she did a lot of songs from the first album, Sevas Tra. You may have heard Battle Ready or Blood Pigs.
Wait, is she the one who uses a pig head on stage?
Yeah! That's her! She uses it for Blood Pigs. Her stuff is really political and social, a lot of people don't like her.
I remember seeing her at Ozzfest, I liked her. Doesn't she have a thing with Butcher Babies?
Yeah, she was saying something about them. I like them, their music is catchy and their show is really high energy.
I saw them at Mayhem fest a few years ago. I went to see Machine Head and caught their set that I really liked.
I love Machine Head. Did you see when they did their solo tour?
Yes! What's your favorite album of theirs?
I love the Unto the Locust. I generally don't like bands who have really long songs but there's something about theirs that I really like.
Me too. I liked their really old stuff. I picked up the new album but I'm not crazy about it, there's a song or two I like.
Have you listened to anything else good lately?
I went to see Stitched Up Heart the other night with Hell or Highwater, that was a good show.
I've heard Stitched Up Heart. Who is Hell or Highwater?
The drummer and singer from Atreyu's new band. It's not all screamy like Atreyu, I really liked them. I met them after the show and got their new album.
Hmm, I'll have to check them out. I forgot about Atreyu, I used to like them a lot.
Me too. I haven't seen them in years, I think the last I thought about them was when they played an Ozzfest.
