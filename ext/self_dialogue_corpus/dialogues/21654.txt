Do you like the Lord of the Rings films?
I liked the original ones.
Did you see the Hobbit trilogy.
No, I am not much one for prequels.
They were amazing.They added a dwarf named Thorin, he even had a love story.
Not much on Hobbit movies.
They are making yet another Tolkien film.
What? More Middle Earth stuff?
In a way, it is more about him than just his works.
What do you mean?
They found a book he had never released and are making a movie about it.
With Hobbits and Dragon?
No, more about him and how he wrote them.
So, like a real life movie about the author.
Yes, I think there will be some fantasy involved.
I liked the way the LOTR movies made the fantasy seem real.
A lot of human struggle in the plot.
Yes, even if it was more of a Hobbit struggle.
I cried when Frodo had to get on the boat.
And leave Sam behind.
