What's your favorite series of movies?
Oh I'd have to say Star Wars. How about you?
For me, I'm going to go with Lord Of The Rings. Talk about an amazing adaptation.
That's cool! Who are your favorite characters?
Personally my favorite characters are Aragorn and Gandalf. Do you have any favorites?
Well if I had to pick, I thin I'd probably go with Pippin just because I think his personality is like mine.
Oh yeah remember when he goes and visits the Ents? I thought that was pretty awesome.
And the CG on Gollum was awesome! They really did a good job.
It was super lifelike. I saw those movies like 3 or 4 times a piece in theaters.
Did you see The Hobbit movies?
I did, but they weren't nearly as good. I kind of got bored.
Well that's what you get when you try to stretch a tiny book into three full length movies I guess.
I'm still a very big Peter Jackson fan though. I liked his King Kong movie.
Me too but it was a weirdly casted movie I thought. Jack black and Adrian Brody?
Yeah you've got a good point. I mean it wasn't the best, but I've always liked King Kong.
Didn't they just make a new one of those?
I believe they did but I haven't seen it. Do you have a favorite monster movie?
Well that's a broad topic. I guess I'd probably pick Godzilla, I can't think of a lot of other recent monster movies.
I guess most of the movies in that topic are old, unless you count Pacific Rim or something.
Yeah but those were robots not monsters. Oh well, I still really liked that movie.
