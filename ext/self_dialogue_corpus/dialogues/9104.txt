Did you ever hear of an old guy called Bob Seger?
Yeah.  Bob Seger and the Silver Bullet Band.
Yeah.  That's why I was thinking of.
Why do you ask?
I never realized it, but he was the guy that sang Against the Wind.
I think I remember that song being in Forrest Gump when he was running or something.
Something like that.  Turns out he's got quite a few notable songs.
I think he also sang Night Moves.
Okay, I recognize that one too.
He's got more hits than you might think.
