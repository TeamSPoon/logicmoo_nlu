Football seasons is almost here.
I know my husband is already talking about it.
So is mine. He is already arguing about how great the Patriots will be this season.
Oh please they are nothing but a bunch of cheaters.
Everytime i remind him of that he says it was just a misunderstanding.
Nothing like making excuses for a dirty team.
I know you agree with me that the Steelers are so much better then the Patriots.
I grew up in Pittsburgh so definatly they are the best team.
I really hate when they play the Ravens
I just dont like the Ravens i think they just display poor sportsmenship
I agree plus theyre fans do not help with the way they act
yes they are terrible wether they win or lose.
So are you guys gonna try to make it to any games this year.
I really want to see the Steelers play a home game
I am pretty sure theyre first game is a home game in September.
Yes they play the Cleveland Browns at home.
Maybe you should go to that one it is a sure win for the Steelers.
I dont know they have lost to them a few times.
I dont know if my husband wants to go to a preseason game
Remind him how much cheaper they are.
