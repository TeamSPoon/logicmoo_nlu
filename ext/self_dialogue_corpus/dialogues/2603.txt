Who do you think will win the Superbowl this year?
It is awful early to start guessing that?
But if you had to pick.
I think the Patriots are always in the running.
I really hope they are not this year.
It has gotten old seeing them there year after year.
I think the Raiders might actually have a chance.
I think they will be good this year.
They have been improving lately.
Not to mention Lynch.
Of course that is a great addition.
He is a great running back.
He is.  I would put him in a class with Adrian Pederson.
Definitely.
I think the Skittles commercials are funny.
He must really like that candy.
He must.
It will be fun to see how they do.
As long as it is not the Pats I guess.
Exactly.
