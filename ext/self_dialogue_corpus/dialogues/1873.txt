I think it's just a matter of time the NFL will have women coaching their teams.
Yeah, I think it could happen any day now.
Why do you say that? You heard something I haven't?
No but they're allowing women reporters in the locker rooms so its-
I think the reporters in the locker room thing is about marketing more than its about NFL football.
There are many more women sports newscasters than ever so its just a matter-
Again, I don't think the NFL-
But there are women coaches in the NBA right?
You mean the WNBA don't you?
If women can coach NBA or WNBA then they coach NFL teams.
I believe its gonna happen but first you'll hear about a women's investment group owning a NFL team.
So it won't be about NFL football? It'll be about money and investments?
It'll be about women participating in NFL's business decisions and that will bring about remale coaching change.
I wonder why it has not happen yet?
NFL is an old boy's club and traditions are hard to break.
That's why I know it'll happen soon the NF-
Is still dominated by men who resist change.
You know if more male coaches in the NFL would open themselves up to change-
women would takeover the one place men can go and still bond.
You, like the NFl need much helpt and much prayer.
