That's the kind of stuff I like, those Irish guys you sent me.
Class A'z?
Yeah, I like their flow. Kind of reminds me of Tupac.
Really? I didn't think they were similar at all.
Well to me they are.
What is it exactly you like?
Just how smooth and flowing and relaxed it is.
I gotcha. I find Tupac's aural components relaxing whereas Class A'z lyrical construction relaxes me.
I think that's what I mean.
Yeah and like that music video of their I sent you I thought was a good example of that.
