Who do you think are the most famous players in the NFL?
Hm, I think that's pretty subjective.
What do you mean, why?
Well, some might know more than others.
And I guess the definition of "famous" isn't concrete.
Exactly, but I tell you which players I know the best.
Agreed, I saw number one is Tom Brady.
Definetely, I was going to say the same.
All of the Patriots are pretty well known though.
Yeah, but Brady is married to Giselle Bunchen and she's a model.
Oh, yeah, a power couple.
I think Dante Culpepper is pretty well known.
Who is that?
He was a quaterback for the Minnesota Vikings.
Ahhh, okay, you like that team don't you?
Yeah, Dante lives in my city!
Wow, that's amazing!
Yeah, he's super nice.
Well those two are pretty good famous football players.
Agreed.
