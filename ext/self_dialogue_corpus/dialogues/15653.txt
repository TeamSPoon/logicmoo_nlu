Do y'all have any hot old school music radio stations in Philly?
Man we do. We got this station called WDAS. They be playing them jams.
What the be playing?
They play everybody. They playing Luther Vandross right now.
Which song?
Since I lost My Baby.
Oh I love that song. I also like A House is a Home.
Me too. Oh now they're playing some Boyz To Men. Motown Philly.
I like Boyz To Men. But I'd listen to New Edition before them.
New Edition with or WITHOUT Bobby Brown?
WITHOUT. You know Johnny Gill hit the scene and New Edition became hot all over again.
I like Johnny Gill ever since him and Stacey Latisaw did Perfect Combination.
I think they both were like teenagers when they made that song. He left her and her career fizzled.
Yeah, they did use to be a couple. I just thought they did a record together.
Man, Johnny Gill made solo music, hooked up with New Edition, and we ain't heard nothing from Stacey Latisaw.
That's because Teena Marie hit the scene and crushed the game. I lost my mind when I found out Teena Marie was white.
Me too. I thought she was a sista. Teena Marie was the truth though.
Speaking of her, I want to hear my song right now.
Which one?
You Make Love Like Springtime. Teena be hitting them hight notes I tell you.
