I wonder if Carrie Fisher is going to be in the next film.
Not sure what they are going to do with her to be honest.
I hope they don't make her a CGI character.
I don't think they will.  If they do, it won't be obvious.
It's a shame that she died so young.
Very tragic.  They will honor Leia I'm sure.
They will probably use her real life death to move forward.
That's my guess as well.
Onto the future and turning the reins over to a new generation.
Very poetic of you, but probably an astute observation.
