Who do you think is the highest rated major league baseball team of all time?
That would be the New York Yankees, of course.
I am not sure. The Yankees did have Babe Ruth, Roger Maris, Mickey Mantle, and Lou Gehrig, but what about lately?
The Yankees have been in 27 world series.
I think the Yankees are great, but the Boston Red Sox are my favorite.
The Boston Red Sox are good and some of their best players have been Ted Williams, Wade Boggs, and Manny Ramirez.
What do you think about the Atlanta Braves?
