Kevin Durant was on fire last night. Did you see the game?
Nah. My mother-in-law came over and we all went out to dinner.
You missed a decent game, bro.
How many points did Durant score?
16 points in less than 3 minutes.
Not too shabby.
Yeah, I like to call him a 'stealth scorer'.
You trademarked that?
Haha. Not yet.
So how many points did he end up with?
33. That 16 was during the third quarter.
I saw the recap on the news. The Warriors are about to sweep the Spurs.
It looks that way. It's a bit disappointing, though.
How come?
I prefer close games, especially during the playoffs.
Not a fan of blowouts, huh?
Never have been. It's like, no contest.
Who knows. Maybe the Spurs will turn it around and tie-up the series.
That would be awesome, but I doubt it'll happen.
Me too.
