Were you ever a fan of The Cult?
You kidding me? Their music is awesome.
I agree, Ian Astbury is definitely one of my all time favorites.
Yeah, I love British bands that have a hard rocking American bluesy sound to their music.
You know the song The Boys are Back in Town by Thin Lizzy?
Yeah dude, classic song. Makes you want to go hit the town and drink a few beers.
They're a bunch of Irish dudes. Thin Lizzy's an Irish band.
That's awesome, it's like the most iconic American sounding blues rock song, an Irish tribute to America I guess.
Unfortunately, the lead singer went out Jimi Hendrix style. It sucks.
Hendrix's death was such a tragedy. He's the best guitarist of all time.
Why did all the best rock bands of the '70's have to end with some type of tragic demise?
Not all of them went out like that, but you're right, a bunch of those dudes went out way too early.
I'd say the most tragic was Lynyrd Skynyrd. Plane crash and I don't think anyone made it out alive.
Just like Buddy Holly and Ritchie Valens back in the day. Those guys were fantastic musicians.
Ian Astbury and The Cult are still rocking today thank goodness.
She Sells Sanctuary is easily one of my top five favorite songs.
That and Fire Woman kick butt. I never get tired of those songs.
How long have they been playing together anyway?
At least since the early '80's off an on. I know they have had their fair share of breakups and reunions.
Yeah, it's pretty darn cool how good music really lasts the test of time.
