What are you listening to right now?
I am playing a song by Coldplay.
I love Coldplay! What is the name of the lead singer? I forgot his name
His name is Chris Martin.
He has a phenomenal voice. I love when he sings.
Yes, I do too. Coldplay is one of my favorite bands.
They are from England, right?
They are! They've been around for quite a while at this point too.
One of the first songs I heard from them was called Yellow
I remember that song. It is beautiful.
Their song has really evolved over the years though.
I agree. My favorite song from them is Clocks.
The piano part on that song is phenomenal.
You are right. That is why I like it so much.
Do you have any other favorites from them?
i recently fell in love with a song from them called Sky Full of Stars.
That song is relatively new, right?
Yes. It is a pretty new song. It got a lot of radio play.
I definitely heard it on the radio a few times.
I think I am going to listen to the radio soon. I hope they play that song!
