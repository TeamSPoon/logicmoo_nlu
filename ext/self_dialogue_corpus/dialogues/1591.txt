Hey, how do you think the Niners are going to do this year?
I think they are still rebuilding but I think they will have a stronger start then people expect.
Yeah, I agree. Shannanhan is going to see a lot of success quickly.
I think he has a chip on his shoulder because of how the Super Bowl ended.
Yeah, he has something to prove.
How many wins do you think they are going to get?
Nine, I think.
Yeah, I wouldn't be surprised of they got second in the division.
Me too, though I think we might be overly optimistic.
Probably, but you gotta hope right?
yeah, who do you think is going to take it all this year?
I'm getting the feeling that a team is going to come out of nowhere and surprise everyone this year.
Oh yeah? Any Ideas on who?
Not entirely sure. Maybe someone like the Dolphins or something.
I could see something like that happening.
Yeah, them or the Titians are my best guess.
Where are you going to watch the games?
I'm getting Sunday Ticket this year. You should come by.
Sounds good. Will do.
Great, I'll give you a call when the games start up.
