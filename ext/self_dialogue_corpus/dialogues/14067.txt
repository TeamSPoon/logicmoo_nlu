Man I love Lady Gaga!
Me too.  There's something about her music that just makes you want to dance!
Every time I hear "Bad Romance" I can't help but sing along and dance.
I like that her music is unconventional.
Like "Born this Way?"
Yes!  I love that Lady Gaga embraces being different.
Me too.  Did you see her when she was helping coach on American Idol?
I did.  I think she's such a great role model.
I agree.  I really liked watching her in concert too. You should have seen her perform "Poker Face"
She does put on a great show!  I remember watching her on the Super Bowl.
