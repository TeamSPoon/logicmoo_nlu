Who is your favorite Fast & Furious actor?
Paul Walker. I love his character of Brian O'Connor. From good guy, to bad guy...back to good again.
Then back to bad. I adore Ludarcis' character. He's so funny!
He and Tyrese Gibbs are awesome. The way their two characters are always fighting, yet they are there for each other always.
I have to admit that Jason Statham's addition to the franchise made things easy on the eyes.
I loved the way he and Hobbs met. Even though he is a bad guy, I love Deckard Shaw.
That accent! The way he fights, the way he always is one step ahead of Dom and his team.
Even when he is put in maximum security, he is still one step ahead of Hobbs.
I was so sure that Elana and Hobbs were going to end up together, instead of her and Dom.
I was too. But, she and Dom made a striking couple for a little while.
