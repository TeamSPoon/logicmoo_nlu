I have always been a music lover.
Me too but and I have been able to change with the times.
Exactly, like I love the current pop music but I can still get into 80's music like it's fresh.
80's music will always leave a legacy.
It was so rich and colorful.
Yes and it's not classic.
The current music has a feel good vibe that I feel we missed in the 90's.
Yes pop music really began to take off again in the 2000's.
I agree with artists Brittany, Justin and Christina.
Yes! and then you got Miley, Rianna, and Bruno Mars.
I still listen to them all.
Even Maroon 5 makes me nostalgic and they aren't that old.
That's the thing with good pop music. The songs don't get old.
I think they mainly get played too much.
Exactly then you change the radio station.
I know that's right but it will then be years and you hear it and you crank it up.
That is so true. Songs that were overplayed tend to be what you later want to listen to.
Music also brings you back to times passed.
Yes that's why I like the 80's music.
Me too because it takes me back to childhood.
