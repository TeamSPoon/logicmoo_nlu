I like older Beatles songs.
Like which ones?
I really like Back in the USSR.
That's an okay one.
Just okay.
The music is pretty simplistic.
Yeah but it's representative of their rivalry with The Beach Boys.
What do you mean?
It's the Beatles' version of California Girls, how they name women from different areas.
Huh, yeah that makes sense.
