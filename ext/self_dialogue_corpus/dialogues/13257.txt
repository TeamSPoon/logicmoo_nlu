So what do you think of the new Star Wars movies?
They're okay, I've only seen one of the new ones.
Yeah, I feel the same lukewarm way.
It just isn't the same without George Lucas directing them.
Yes, and now everything is computer-generated, so it gives it a cheap and fake look.
I miss the miniatures and models they used on the first trilogy too.
Were you surprised that they killed off Han Solo?
Unfortunately I knew that outcome going in, as someone spoiled it for me online.
I hate when that happens because it ruins a good chunk of the story.
I still enjoyed the movie actually, but it definitely didn't shock me like it did to some other moviegoers.
