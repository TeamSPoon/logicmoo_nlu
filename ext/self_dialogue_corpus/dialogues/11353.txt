Have you heard ringo is coming out with another album?
I read that somewhere.
I think the end of this year or early next.
I love ringo and I really like his solo stuff.
He's had a lot of hits. He's touring again with an all star band too.
Wow,I saw him a few years ago. Great show!!
I did too. Joe Walsh was part of the group.
He's great on his own too.
Yes,and he's ringo brother in law.
That's right. He got married after the Beatles broke up.
