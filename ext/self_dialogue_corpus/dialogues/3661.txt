Seen any good thriller movies yet?
I just watched Kill Bill this weekend.
That was a good movie.  Mind twist, action, even a little bit of comedy.
Yeah, one cool part was when the did the anime style part.
Yeah that was good.  The fight scene at the end was great too.
Yeah, and I liked the first scene where she was fighting that lady.
Yeah, and her escape from the hospital.
That was pretty cool.
I liked when they made the sword too.
Yeah, that was awesome.  Just all around a great movie.
