I'm going to binge watch some classic kung-fu flicks this weekend. Any suggestions?
You have to watch Enter The Dragon.
I'm not a big fan of that one.
Not a big fan? Why not? Everyone loves that movie.
I have seen it a few times, but I don't like how slow and boring it is.
I've never heard anyone describe Enter The Dragon as slow and boring before.
What else do you suggest?
You're sticking with the 70s cinema?
Of course. Those are the best.
Have you seen the one about the Flying Guillotine?
Master of the Flying Guillotine? I love that one.
After seeing that movie when I was a kid, I attached my dad's cowboy hat to a yo-yo and started chasing my friends around as the guillotine guy.
How inventive. The Five Deadly Venoms is a good one too.
It is. It's one of the best. Which venom was your favorite?
The Scorpion because of his cool kicks. I like the lizard style too.
Yeah, that dude could run up walls like Spider-Man.
The Toad was the weakest style, though. That's why he got killed off so soon in the movie.
That guy just didn't know how to handle himself. I mean, how can someone with invulnerability get beat?
He had a weak spot, so he wasn't all that invulnerable.
Yeah, I know. Bad writing.
