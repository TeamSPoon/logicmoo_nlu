You know what movie I think of all the time?
No, what movie?
I think of 101 Dalmatians.
That's really random. Why do you think of it?
Every night my dog will listen to other dogs barking outside and start to bark too.
So it reminds you of that scene from the movie with the dogs passing along a message from the other dogs?
It reminds me exactly of that.
That's funny. I used to love that movie when I was a kid.
Me too! I loved one of the puppies named Lucky.
I always like Patches the best myself.
