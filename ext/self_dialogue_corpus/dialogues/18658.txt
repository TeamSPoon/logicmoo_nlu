Wow, I just saw a video by Felonious Lads.
Who?
Felonious Lads.  They're a band with a fusion of rockabilly and pop rock.
Sounds weird!
No, they're great!
Are you talking about the guy who sings with a snake around his neck?
No, that's SnakeJuice.  But they sound similar.
I think Snake is more rock.
Yes, they are.
What does Felonious sound like?
Hmmmmm.  They remind me of pop rockers but dress like the 60s rockabilly guys.
That sounds very cool.
Actually, they're my favorite right now.
Out of everybody?
Yes, because they're so unique.
I get that.
Let me turn it up.  I'm listening to "Break Out" now.
Ok, awesome.
Did you like it?
Oh yeah, they are jamming!
