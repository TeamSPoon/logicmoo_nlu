So it looks like we will all finally get to see the Warriors vs. Cavaliers in the finals.
I know, Seems as though we have been waiting forever!
It's obvious those were to two best teams in the league this year hands down.
Yeah, I've been quite disappointed with the rest of the playoffs up to this point, blow out after blow out!
That's true, but at least we have an amazing NBA finals to look forward to.
No doubt about it, who do you have eventually coming out on top?
I am really torn on this one; both teams have been dominant this post season.
To me, the Cavaliers have been by far the most impressive team in the entire NBA playoffs.
That's hard to argue especially since it is looking as though they will go into the finals undefeated.
Actually, it is looking more and more like we will have two undefeated teams for the first time ever in NBA history.
I am excited to see how LeBron handles the Big Four from Golden State.
Yea me to, but Kyrie Irving will play a major factor if the Cavs are to come out on top.
Even though this is LeBron's seventh straight finals, I feel this will be his most challenging one yet.
I'm with you there, the Warriors might just have too much fire power.
Kevin Durant went down once to Lebron in the finals, I have a feeling he is going to play very well.
Yeah, but that time he did not have the Splash Brothers to help him out.
Yeah, Curry and Thompson will make things a lot easier for Durant this time around.
True, the will for sure and we have yet to factor in Draymond Green.
Ultimately, I am inclined to believe that the Warriors will get their second championship in the past three years.
I disagree, the Cavs are just too dominant right now, I think LeBron goes back to back.
