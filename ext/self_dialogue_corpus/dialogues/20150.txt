I just saw the new Pirate of the Caribbean movie.
How was it?
It was definitely entertaining. Followed the formula for the other movies of the series, but was fun nonetheless.
I heard that there were some of the actors from previous movies in it from previous movies in the series.
Well, Johnny Depp as Jack Sparrow of course and Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightly were also in it for a little bit.
Didn't Orlando Bloom's character die in one of the movies?
Well, he didn't actually die, but he was banished to guard Davy Jones' locker. The plot of this movie was his son's attempt to free him from this  curse.
I suppose he succeeded?
Of course!
We're the special effects pretty good?
They were. I also thought the stunt work was pretty spectacular.
I wonder how much of his stunt work Johnny Depp actually does.
No idea, but I do know that he or Disney said this would probably be the last movie in the series.I'm not sure I buy that.
Why do you say that?
Well, if you stay until all the credits run, there's a scene that is a perfect lead-in to another movie. Most people won't know it even exists if they take off before the credits are done.
Cool. I'll be sure to stay and see it.
Plus the movie is doing well at the box office. If Disney thinks they can make money, they'll surely make another movie.
I agree with you there.
Oh, I just remembered...Paul McCartney had a cameo appearance in the movie. I didn't even recognize him!
I'm pretty sure he had a cameo in a previous movie in the series, but I don't remember which one.
