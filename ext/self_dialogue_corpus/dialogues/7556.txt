I have a weird theory about Neville and Snape, I'm not sure if it makes sense though.
Try me out and I'll tell you if it does.
Okay, so you know how Snape was always even more terrible than normal when it came to Neville?
Yes, he treated him the worst, well up there with Harry at least.
So, my theory is that he treats him so bad because of the prophecy.
The Voldemort/Harry prophecy?
Well, remember, it became Harry's prophecy BECAUSE Voldemort chose him.
Right, he could have chosen Neville, but didn't.
So, if he chose Neville instead of Harry, then Lily would still be alive presumably.
Oh, wow, okay so he hates Neville for being alive, as he sees the prophecy and Voldemort's choice when he sees Neville. Wow.
