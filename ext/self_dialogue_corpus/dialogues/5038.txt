Did you see the Mariners and Twins game?
At Safeco Field? Yeah, I saw it.
Did you see that Cruz home run? That was massive!
Didn't he use steroids?
Well, yes, but that was in the past. He's with the Mariners now.
Oh, I  see.
Who started for the Mariners?
Oh come on, you know it was Paxton.
I think he has a sub-2.00 ERA
I think so too, he's really coming on.
So how are the Yankees doing?
One of the best, if not the best, team in the American League
Do the Yankees play the Mariners this year?
I know they did in years before, not sure about this year.
What happened to Ichiro after he left the Yankees?
I think he's in Miami now.
Soaking up the sun with the Marlins?
Yeah, I guess so.
He says he's going to play into his late fortes. I hope he does!
I hope so too.
