Do you know the opening day for the Titans this season?
I have no idea. I know it's in the beginning of September..
Okay, I'll look up. I want to check the schedule anyway. I'm so excited about them this season.
You think Mariota is 100% now?
I'd imagine so. He is still a young player and I heard that break was a clean one. Easy to mend.
That's good to hear...I like him too.
Yeah, when I lived in Hawaii, all locals were so proud of him. I kind of share the feeling.
It's a pretty good team all in all...done well last year.
I know, they surprised us all, didn't they?
Much like the Raiders?
Oh, yeah! What was up with that?
Maybe they are showing up so they can move to Vegas...
haha...that maybe! Vegas would be better than Oakland!
Oh, and the Vikings did well, too.
Yes! my boyfriend was so happy about that! He's from St. Paul.
Oh, I bet he hate the Packers then!
Of course! Just like how I don't like the Falcons...
It's okay, no body much care about the Falcons.
I am really hoping for a great season for the Titans.
Good luck! I don't think they are quite ready for the Superbowl, but who knows....
