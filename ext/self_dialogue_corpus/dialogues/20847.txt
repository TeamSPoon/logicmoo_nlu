What is your favorite Action movie?
There are so many good action movies I'm not sure.
My favorite has to be Mission Impossible.
Yes I love all the movies in that series. Tom Cruise is a great actor.
He really is those are definitely my favorite movies he is in.
My favorite action movie might be The Fast and the Furious.
I love that series of movies as well! It is a shame that Paul Walker passed away.
I agree, I haven't been able to watch the newest one as it is hard to accept he won't be in it.
He left us way to young. I hope he rests in peace and that his friends and family can find closure.
It was definitely hard for Vin Diesel to lose Walker. They were great friends.
I know I don't think he expected to lose Paul when he was still so young.
To change the subject, Jurassic World was another great action movie.
I also think that was a great movie. They really did justice for the original Jurassic Park movie.
I know I felt really nostalgic while watching it and kept thinking about the original.
Who was your favorite actor in Jurassic World?
Probably Chris Pratt as I thought he fit the role really well.
I love Chris Pratt! He was definitely great in Jurassic World.
Judy Greer was also great she is such a beautiful and funny girl!
I agree I love Judy and Chris they both did great.
I will definitely be rewatching Jurassic World soon!
