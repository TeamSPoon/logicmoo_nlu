I really miss the TV show Chuck.
I liked that show. What do you miss the most?
The music by Jeffster.
They were so funny!
I loved the episode when they sang Push It.
That was a crack up.
I also like when they did Mr. Roboto.
My favorite was in the series finale of Chuck when they performed Take on Me.
That was really suspenseful.
It was,and I'm glad the song worked.
