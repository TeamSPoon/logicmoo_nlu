Can you pick a new song? This rain is crazy, I need to keep my eyes on the road.
Sure. What kind of thing to you want.
Just anything to pass the time.
Hmm. What have you even got on here?
Not a whole lot. The ones with the green arrow are downloaded onto the phone.
Oh, okay. I could do Punch Brothers.
I didn't know you liked them.
Yeah. Well, I at least really like Julep.
That's a great song.
Do you know any other bands like them?
Well, there's some Lord Huron on there too. I like them.
I know them! "Lonesome Dreams" is a favorite of mine.
Me too!
What else have you got?
There's some Decemberists tracks.
This Is Why We Fight had such a great music video.
Have you seen the one for Sixteen Military Wives?
No! Should I?
It's great. It reminds me of Rushmore!
I'll take a look when I get home.
