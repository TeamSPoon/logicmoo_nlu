Remember that duo from Europe?
Which duo from Europe? Europe is a big country.
Shut up. You know those black dudes with hair extensions, caught not singing their own songs or something.
Milli Vanilli.
Yeah! Which one was Milli and which was Vanilli?
i don't think that's how they worked.
Anyway, whatever happened to them?
They tried to sing in front of camera once they got busted, and they were both tone deafs.
Hahaha. That's so funny.
Well, they were from Germany. They can't really sing in English
But how come they thought they coudl pull it off? it's just so stupid.
Well, one they got the record out and videos made, it just came down to the tours, and they were just lip syncing in the live performances
That never goes over well.
No. so rumors started flying around that they're not the actual recording artists, blah blah.
And they weren't
Nope. It was some fat black guy who was the main vocal. he couldn't really sing that well either.
So they were forced to admit they weren't the real singers? Milli Vanilli, I mean
Yeah. On camera during a show. it was hilarious. That's how bad their singing was.
Didn't they have to give up their grammy?
They were stripped of it, yes. Ah, the hilarity of the 80s.
