What was your favorite Disney movie as a kid?
The Lion King.
I love that movie.
Yeah Scar was scary and ruthless.
But a good character.
But who could forget Timone and Pumba?
Those guys were so funny.
James Earl Jones as Mufasa was great.  His voice has so much power.
I know.  And the baboon was funny.
How could I forget the baboon?
