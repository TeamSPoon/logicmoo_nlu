Do you like The Beatles?
They're okay I guess.
What do you mean they're okay?
Just what I said.  I've heard better.
What song of The Beatles do you like the most?
The only one I know is Penny Lane.
Are you sure the Beatles did that one?
I may not be crazy about them but I do know some of their songs.
I'm just messing with you that is one of my favorites too.
What's with all the questions about the Beatles anyway?
