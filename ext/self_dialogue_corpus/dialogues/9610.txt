So what is your favorite Tupac song of all time?
Wow, that's a tough one to answer!  He had so many great songs.
I know!  It'd be easier to make a top ten list than to pick one.
Yeah, for sure.  But I guess if I had to pick one I'd pick Until the End of Time.
Oh yeah, I love that one.  I'd say California Love, though.
Yeah, that's definitely on my top ten list.
I wish he had kept making music.  He was unbelievable.
Yeah, he was truly a legend.  There will never be another artist like him.
No, definitely not.  It's a tragedy.
At least we still have his music to preserve his legacy.
