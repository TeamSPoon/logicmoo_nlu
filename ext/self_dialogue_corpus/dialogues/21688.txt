Do you know what I do every Halloween and Christmas?
What do you do every Halloween and Christmas?
I watch three movies that pertain to the holiday on that day-- so, scary movies for Halloween, and Christmas movies for Christmas.
What are the movies?
For Halloween, it's The Thing, The Shining, and The Exorcist, in that order.
All great movies.  What about Christmas?
National Lampoons Christmas Vacation, Scrooged, and Elf.
Does it have to be in that order?
No, for those it's usually Scrooged and Elf once, and then Vacation around the clock.
I think Christmas Vacation is be far the best Vacation movie.
The original was pretty good, too.
Do you watch romantic movies on Valentine's Day?  Or Born on the Fourth of July on the 4th of July?
No, that tradition is only for Halloween and Christmas.
Are those your favorite scary movies?
Absolutely, yes.  What are your favorites?
I think Zodiac is really scary.  Not that the movies you listed aren't scary, but Zodiac is all based on real events.
Good point.  Do you have any favorite Christmas movies?
Die Hard.
Haha, Die Hard?
Yeah, he's at the office building for a Christmas party.  And Rocky 4!  Also happens around Christmas time.
