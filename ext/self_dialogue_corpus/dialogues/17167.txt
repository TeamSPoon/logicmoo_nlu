Do you like Train?
I love Train.  They have a lot of that great coffee shop music.
Like Soul Sister.
My daughter loves that song.  When she was young she thought it was about missing your sister and her baby brother was singing about her.
That is the most adorable thing I've ever heard.
I know.  Now she's 9 and he's 6 and all she does is complain about him.
Typical siblings.  Hey how about This Will be My Year?
I love that one.  It's kind of what I always tell myself after things go wrong.
Yeah?  Like hoping things will get better and this will be your year?
Exactly.  How about Drops of Jupiter.
Train classic, also don't forget Save Me San Francisco.
That's a good one.  Has a little bit of bounce to it.
Yeah, and still keeps that mellow feeling.
I also liked 50 Ways to Say Goodbye.
That's a fun one.  Kind of makes you smile.
Yeah that's what I like about it.  Still musically good too.
I like a fun song now and again.  And I guess that qualifies.
For sure.  What about Marry Me?
Good song.  A little sappy though.
Would be a good wedding song though.
