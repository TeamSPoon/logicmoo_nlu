Did you ever see Shrek The Musical?
No I haven't, is it any good?
It's a whole lot better than I thought it would be. My kids love it.
I'll have to check it out. I absolutely love musicals.
Me too! What's your favorite musical.
That would definitely have to be Grease. The songs are timeless.
That's my favorite too. I also love West Side Story.
Oh that will always be one of the greatest. I like Annie.
The new one or the classic one with Carol Burnett?
I like both but I think I might like the original better.
Right the dance numbers are bigger, set design, all of that is a lot better.
Frozen is my kids' favorite musical, of course.
I think that's most kids' favorite. Those songs are grade A earworms.
I had Let it Go stuck in my head for weeks after seeing that movie.
Me too. My favorite song from that movie though is Do You Wanna Build a Snowman.
That is a cute number. I like My Fair Lady, that's an old one.
Oh I like that one too as well as The Sound of Music.
So many classic songs came out of that one. It's a great musical.
Sister Act is a little unconventional as a musical but they had some great songs.
Right and who would have known Whoopi Goldberg had a pretty good voice?
