Who was the best Star Wars villain?
That's easy, Darth Vader all the way.
He was just awesome.  Maybe the best bad guy in movie history.
Yeah, not that many can stand up to him.
He also had the most raw power potential of any character.
This is true, but after his injuries he might have actually been powered down.
I thought that.  He was the best though.
So intimidating too.
Yeah, with that deep voice and the Force choke.
He was just unleashed in Empire Strikes back.
