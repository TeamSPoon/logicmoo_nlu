Lady Gaga's music completely illustrates the sad state of American pop music today.
Why's that?
Have you ever heard of Stefani Germanotta?
No.  Who's that?
That's Lady Gaga's real name.
Really?
Yes, she studied music academically in New York and was working professionally as a pianist and singer before she was even old enough to drive.
Wow.
But, being talented wasn't good enough for her to become a famous singer.  She had to put on meat dresses and masks and sing like a robot for anyone to take her seriously.
You're right.  American pop music is pretty sad.
