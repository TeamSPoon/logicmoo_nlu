What did you think of the Hamilton Mixtape?
Could anything ever compete with the brilliance of the original sountrack?
Definitely not, but there's some cool new takes on the mixtape.
I did really like the "Immigrants We Get The Job Done" song with K'NAAN.
And the Ashanti and Ja Rule version of "Helpless?"
Going back to 2001 with that pairing.
The Sia and Queen Latifah combo on "Satisfied" is also brilliant.
I guess Sia can't rap! Queen Latifah hits it out of the park, though!
The whole mixtape is a really eclectic group of artists. Chance the Rapper and Jimmy Fallon on the same album?
Jimmy Fallon's song is so hilarious! He makes for a perfect King George.
Have you seen the original Hamilton on Broadway yet?
The tickets are so expensive! At this point I don't have hundreds of dollars for a Broadway show. But it'd be so worth it.
My sister saw it earlier this year and said it will be the greatest Broadway show of all time.
And Alexander Hamilton wasn't the most likely Broadway musical star. But his story really fits Broadway.
I think we're also searching for our origin story as a country. What were our values? How were we made?
And the conflicts you see in the music are still happening in today's politics. Big government, small government?
Like in the rap battle between Hamilton and Thomas Jefferson?
And George Washington moderating?
What colonial revolutionary will be the star of the next Broadway hit musical?
Please, please let it be Dolly Madison! Heck, I'll write that show!
