Do you think that head trauma is a serious issue in NFL football?
Yes, but maybe overstated?
Overstated in what way?
I mean, these players know what they are getting in to.
But we only recently had the technology and understanding to be aware of these issues.
I somewhat agree. They still get millions of dollars per year.
This is true, but is it worth it if you can't walk at age 45?
That is a good point - does that take away from the game?
Yes and no - I just think we need to take more preventative measures.
Hopefully they can increase padding and teach more fundamentally sound diving.
We will see - both of those would be nice options.
Yes, it may take years, though.
I think a solution would be to obviously encourage less head-based collisions.
Agreed, but they already do that to an extent.
Yes, but perhaps not enough.
Maybe the referees could be even more strict.
Yes, that would help some.
They already do so much though!
I think the issues of head injuries will continue to plague the modern NFL.
Yes, it will - but it is beautiful nonetheless.
