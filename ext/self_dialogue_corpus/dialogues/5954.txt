Oh my goodness do you remember pinnochio
Do I ever. The wooden boy
A classic for sure
Gippeto really loved his wooden doll
Yeah I know. All pinnochio wanted to do was become a real boy
Him meet I g the bad guys didn't help him much
Jimminy cricket was one of my favorites
Yeah. He was pinnochio voice of reason
In the end when he became a real boy I think I cried
Well he finally got what he wanted
