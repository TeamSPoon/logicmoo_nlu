What do you think of Hut's I think they're called in Star Wars?
The big dudes that are always leading the cartel's and what not?
Exactly right.
Well I think they're lazy for starters and i'm not sure why they're even in that position to begin with maybe it's just the money they have.
Well they're big so that's intimidating.
Yes but they can barely move at all.
That's a solid point.
Yeah so I don't get it but I do like them as a whole in the movies.
Some good scenes came out of them for sure.
Yep.
