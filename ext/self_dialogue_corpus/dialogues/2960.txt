Hey, how ready are you for NFL this year?
I'm always excited to watch football!
Who will you be cheering on this year?
I'm very loyal to the Kansas City Chiefs!
The Chiefs suck. What do you think about them letting Jamaal Charles go?
They couldn't afford to keep him. He only played a few games last season.
Yeah, that knee of his is quite the liability, huh?
Haha, yeah it is. I'm glad Denver signed him though. He is a good player.
Yeah, definitely. Me too.
Who will you be cheering for this season?
I'm going for the raiders!
Oh yeah? They are moving their stadium to vegas, aren't they?
Yes, they are!
Any idea why? I thought that was pretty weird.
They had been trying to find a new stadium in the Bay Area but just didn't have any luck.
Oh wow, their current stadium is pretty old right?
Yeah, it's very old and just doesn't bring in the money it needs to.
Gotch'ya. That sucks that they have to move but, I'm sure it will be worth it!
Yeah, they scored and amazing deal for their new stadium!
That's great for their team!
