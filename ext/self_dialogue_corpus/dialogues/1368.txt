Hey, what do you think about football?
As in the NFL?
Yea, the NFL.
I love it!  Season ticket holder!
Season tickets!?
Yea, I went to so many games last year that it just made sense
How many did you go to exactly?
All of them!
ALL OF THEM!?!?
Yea I'm a diehard fan!
I guess you are!
Let's go Buffalo!
...
What?
What a waste of season tickets!
Not a fan I take it?
Of the Bills?  Nope!
Well to each his own then!
I guess you could say that...
