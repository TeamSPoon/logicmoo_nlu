Have you seen the Yellow Submarine?
No. I don't like cartoony trippy movie.
The music is great.
I bet it is. But then I can listen to it on my own.
Yellow submarine is my favorite Beattle's song!
There are so many good ones! It is hard to pick a favorite.
What is your least favorite?
I don't like the stuff from the White Album.
I do! But I don't Sergant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club band.
It does go on a long time.
