I remember Queen, do you?
Yes where were they from?
They were a British rock band.
The song We Will Rock You was a big hit.
It still is.  It's one of their top songs.
Didn't the singer die?
Yes he died awhile back.
Thats too bad, he had a good voice.
I liked the song Bohemian Rhapsody.
That was an original, one of a kind.
