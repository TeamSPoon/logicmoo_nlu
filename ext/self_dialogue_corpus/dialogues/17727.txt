Do you think George Harrison was underrated.
Yes,for a long time.
I agree.
When you back now,you can see his talent emerge.
Back then it was John and paul.
Pretty much so.
George kept writing better songs.
Big one was while my guitar gently weeps.
Great guitar work.
ERIC Clapton has done it with him.
Yes he has.
He broke through with something off abbey road.
And with here comes the sun.
Just tremendous songs.
I loved his last album brainwashed.
It was really good.
Some beatleesque feel on some songs.
I enjoyed any road off that album.
Nice rhythm to it.
Nice and smooth.
