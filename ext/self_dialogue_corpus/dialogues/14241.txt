Have you been watching the NBA playoffs?
Yeah, I haven't missed a game yet!  Who are you pulling for?
I am a Celtics fan, but I've watched every game also.  Who do you pull for?
I am pulling for the Warriors.  I hope they pull it off this year!
They have a good chance.  Did you watch the games yesterday?
Yes, the Celtics got crushed.  There haven't been many good games in the 2nd round.
I know, the first round was pretty good, but this second round has been mainly blow out games.
I think it will be the Warriors and the Cavs in the Finals.
I agree.  It sucks that Tony Parker got injured.  That killed the Spurs chances
I know, it was tough to see.  He is such a great player.
Did you see the Wizard playing who got ejected vs the celtics in game 3?
Yes!  That was crazy.  I can't believe he lost his cool like that.
I know.  You can tell he is a young player.
Agreed.  Who do you think wins the MVP this year?
I really hope its Curry again, but it may be Westbrook.  He was insanely good for the Thunder.
I hope it's Curry too, but Westbrook does have a good chance.  So many triple doubles
I really don't want it to be LeBron James though.  I am biased because how he kills the Celtics, but i don't like him
He will definitely be a top choice, but I think it will be Curry or Westbrook.
Hopefully the Finals will be some good games and go to 7 like last year.
As long as the Warriors win this time, I agree!
