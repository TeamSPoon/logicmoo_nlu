I can't wait to see the new Harry Potter movie.
I though they'd done them all already?
This is a spin offâ€”Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.
Like that charity book Rowling did?
Exactly.
So what's it about?
I'm not sure. Some magical animal wrangler I think.
I don't think I've seen any promotions for it.
You must have, they were everywhere. New York got blown up.
So it's like a disaster movie?
I think it's supposed to be funny. There was a dragon or something.
I liked the originals, but you're not selling this to me.
But it's got the older character in it. Young Dumbledore!
Oh. Okay that could be fun.
Right?
Will they make him gay in the movies?
They'd better. It's cannon after all.
Is Grendelwald in them?
I think so, but I think it's a twist at the end.
Okay, maybe I'll go see it with you then.
