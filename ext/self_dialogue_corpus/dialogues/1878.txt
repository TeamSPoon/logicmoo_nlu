How's it going? We're having a Superbowl party in a couple of weeks ypu wanna come?
How are you watching the Superbowl in August?
Every year before preseason we throw on a classic playoff game or Superbowl and make a party out of it.
Sounds like a blast. What game are you showing this time?
1990 Superbowl ,Giants and Bills.
I remember that game, it came down to the last play, right?
Yup. Giants won by a point after that missed field goal.
Scott Norwood, the poor guy.
That was Parcell's last game with the Blue.
What a way to go. Do you have a favorite Superbowl of all time?
Although I was a kid when it happened, I'd have to say Broadway Joe in '68.
That game is legendary. As far as classic games go I like '79 Steelers and Cowboys.
You must be a Steelers fan, they all love that game.
That's right. what's not to love? - Terry Bradshaw, Franco Harris.
Bradshaw put up some serious numbers in that game.
Dude he threw for 318 yards and four touchdowns.
Roger Staubach was no slouch in that game.
A dropped pass made the difference.
Most years I think the final playoff games are more exciting than the Superbowl.
Everybody is trying to make it to the Show. They have more at stake on playoff Sunday.
