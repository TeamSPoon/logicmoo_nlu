Did you watch the pirates baseball game against the yankees last night?
Yes I did. that game was amazing!
I know. The way it ended with a grand slam was unexpected.
I agree. that was one the longest home runs I have ever seen.
yeah, it was crushed! the sound it made off the bat you knew instantly it was a home run.
Sounds like you were at the game?
I was at the game. Sat right behind home plate. It was awesome
I'm jealous. I have always wanted to go to a game, but just watch on TV
I would recommend it. The pitching was great for seven innings.
seemed like a pitchers dual for most of the game until the 7th when the bats woke up
the last three innings took forever to play.
I know. so many pitching changes and no one could get an out.
The worst part is that they stop serving beer after the 7th inning. It's a law I guess.
I didn't know that! I had more beer from the 7th inning on then I did in the first part of the game
Yeah, that's the benefit of watching at home. If was still cool to be there and see the walk off grand slam
It looked like a fun time.
You should come with me next time. i have season tickets
I would love to. let me know when the next one is.
Great. I hope the Pirates make the playoffs this year
Me too. that would be neat to watch! Go Pirates!
