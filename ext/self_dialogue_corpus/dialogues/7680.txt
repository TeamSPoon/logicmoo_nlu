Have you seen the Harry Potter movies?
No. Should I?
Yes! There's action and magic and drama and a bunch of other stuff. It's great.
Sounds nice. Maybe I'll check it out.
You should. You like Alan Rickman, right?
Yeah, he's in the series?
Yeah, he plays Snape. You might or might not like his character.
Oh yeah? Why not?
Watch the movies for yourself and see! Spoilers, or maybe not spoilers, but there's a plot twist involving him in The Half-Blood Prince if I remember correctly.
Alright, I'll keep an eye out for it.
