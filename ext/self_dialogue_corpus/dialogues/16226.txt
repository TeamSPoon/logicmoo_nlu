What kind of music do you like?
I listen mostly to pop and hip-hop. What about you?
I listen to a ton of different genres.
Are there any genres you don't like?
Yeah, I don't really like country or heavy metal.
Yeah, I don't love those either. But I can tolerate them, I guess.
What are some of your favorite songs?
I like a lot of Katy Perry's music, like Roar in particular. What about you?
I like Aerosmith. I've been listening to a ton of rock lately.
Oh, cool. My dad listens to Aerosmith.
Well then I guess he has some pretty good taste in music. What does your mom listen to?
She loves the Jackson Five and Sean Cassidy.
Oh wow, those are some throwbacks.
Yeah, but they're classics.
They are super catchy, I won't deny it.
Yeah they are. She loves music. She's always singing and dancing around the house.
Good for her. Music is awesome. I wish it was playing all the time.
Maybe you should get some nice headphones so that you can listen to music whenever you want.
Yeah I think I will. And I'll put some more songs on my iPod. Maybe some Lady Gaga.
Oh yeah good idea. I love Lady Gaga.
