Which Disney movie is your favorite, if you had to pick one?
Hummm, that's tough but I guess I'd say Frozen.
I didn't see it until Christmas last year, and I was surprised how much I liked it!
How about you, which is your favorite.
I absolutely loved Mulan.
Who was your favorite character.
A toss up between Mulan and the dragon - I loved Eddie Murphy's sassy attitude.
I liked the oriental setting of that one, too.  The garden at Mulan's house with the cherry blossoms was lovely.
Agree.  I would love to see what happened between Mulan afterwards.
I think they might be making another one but I'm not sure.
