There's a movie I saw as a kid, that I'll probably never know what it was called.
What year was that?
It was around 1970. Saw it in Los Angeles.
Tell me the plot and I'll see if I know what it was.
Well, I think it was a Disney movie, but it seemed to have some violence in it, so I'm not sure.
Was it a drama, a comedy, or animated?
It was a comedy, at least for the first few minutes, when a man was thrown out of a Cadillac.
That doesn't sound like a Disney movie to me!
It must have been rated "G", because my mother took my brother and me to see it. It got a big laugh, though.
What else can you remember about it?
It was a modernized version of "Don Quixote" by Cervantes.
Well, that shouldn't be too hard to identify.
I've looked for years for the thing. There was a big train wreck at the end of the movie.
Do you remember any of the actors? "Don Quixote" came out in 1605, I think. World's best-selling book!
No. I didn't recognize any of them, and don't even remember the middle of the movie.
Who was thrown out of the Cadillac?
It was supposed to be Pancho, the sidekick to "The Man of La Mancha".
And there was a train wreck at the end? There was the musical, "The Man of La Mancha"...
I suppose Pancho and The Man went out on a quest, and derailed a train. But this was no musical.
Odd. There must be a database of movies made by year, or some cross reference to "Don Quixote" you could look up.
