Have you seen the Disney's movie Pirates of the Caribbean?
Which one? Pirates of the Caribbean: part 4 On Stranger Tides?
No not that one, I'm talking about Pirates of the Caribbean 5, released back in May this year!
Yes I got it, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales. Thats the latest one right?
Yes thats the one I'm saying about, have you seen the movie? this time Will Turner comes back!
Yes I heard that too, hope I would be able to go for the movie this weekend. Are you a fan of Will?
Actually I like almost all characters in the movie series Pirates of the Caribbean. Including non human characters!
Yeah exactly, all characters in the movie are really interesting, but I like Jack Sparrow!
Captain Jack Sparrow!! thats his name, Elizabeth Swann says that in second part of the movie series!
Yeah i saw that part, but what happen to Elizabeth Swann? She hasn't been in the movie since the third part?
