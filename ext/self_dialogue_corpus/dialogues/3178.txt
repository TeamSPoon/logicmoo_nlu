You know what I can't figure out about the NFL?
What?
Why are the Dallas Cowboys America's team.
Maybe back in the day, you know, with Roger Staubach and Walt Garrison and Tom Landry.
And Preston Pierson and even Tony Dorsett. Remember Ed Too Tall Jones?
Man, who could forget him? They had everything. Remember that flex defense that Landry invented?
You know, he invented the 4-3 too, way back at Baltimore.
So I agree they were good. No doubt. But now?
They got this Prescott guy from Mississippi State. He was awesome for a rookie.
He wad awesome for a pro.
You got that right. And then that running back.
Ezekiel Elliott from Ohio State. He reminds me of Emmitt Smith.
He's built just like him, isn't he? Runs low to the ground.
Like a bowling ball. Hard to stop, hard to bring down.
So I guess they'll be good again this year.
I'll be honest, I thought they were going to the Super Bowl last year.
Me too. Didn't they have the best record in the league?
I think so. In the conference anyway.All without Tony Romo.
I thought their season was over when he got hurt.
Maybe that's why they're America's team. Overcoming adversity.
