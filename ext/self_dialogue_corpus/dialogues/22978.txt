Have you seen the House on Haunted Hill?
What the original, or the newer one?
I'm talking about the newer one.  I didn't know there was an original.
Oh my goodness, yes!  It was very popular.
When did it come out?
Well the original was in 1959, and the newer one was in 1999.
Oh wow, so a forty year span.  I thought the new one was great!
Yeah it was really scary and well done.  I liked it too.
When did you see it?
It's been awhile.  Didn't it have Taye Diggs in it?
Yes, and Geoffrey Rush.
So what was the original like?
It was similar.  They were being offered $10,000 instead of one million to stay in the house.
Who was in it?
Vincent Price and Carol Ohmart are the only ones I remember.
I bet it was spooky too.
Yeah it was good, but not as good as the remake I don't think.  I thought the second was scarier.
Probably because of the special effects.
Yeah those have definitely come a long way.
I'd still like to see it though.  I'll probably rent it.
