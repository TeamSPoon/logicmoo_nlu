I got home from Las Vegas last night.
Did you win any money?
You've got to be kidding.
Did you see any shows?
I did. I caught the Rat Pack show.
What's that?
It's a show that impersonates the original Rat Pack singers.
Who are they?
The main three would be Dean Martin, Frank Sinatra and Sammy Davis Jr.
I know some of Sammy Davis Jr.'s songs and quite a bit of frank Sinatra, but I don't know who Dean Martin is.
Do you know that song Everybody Loves Somebody Sometime?
I don't think I've ever heard it.
What about That's Amore?
I know that song and like it.
Dean Martin is the singer who made it famous.
Oh I see. So these singers sang songs by these guys?
More than that. They also dressed and acted the part.
Did you know all of the music?
Most of it.
Well I'm glad you enjoyed the show so much.
