So, what's your favorite movie?
To be honest, it's too hard to choose.
Really? For me, it's not hard at all.
Okay then, what's yours?
I don't care what anyone says, but The Dark Knight is my favorite movie of all time.
Believe it or not, but I've never seen that movie. Is it as good as people say it is?
It's phenomenal! The plot constantly holds your attention, the acting is fantastic, and the visuals are breathtaking.
I've always heard that Christian Bale is a fantastic Batman.
He really is! I don't think any actor has been as good with Batman as he has.
I heard Ben Affleck did a solid job.
Yeah, he did alright. It's just a shame that the movie he debuted in as Batman wasn't that great.
I agree. Batman v. Superman had so much potential.
I think that a lot of the hype for the movie died with the one trailer.
You mean the one where they basically spoiled the whole movie?
Yes, that one! Doomsday and Wonder Woman could have been such big surprises.
Speaking of Wonder Woman, what'd you think of her?
I liked her. I think that Gal Gadot is a good fit for her.
It's at least cool that Wonder Woman gets a proper big-screen appearance.
True. I'm so used to only seeing her on TV. I heard that she's getting a solo film?
Yes, she is! It's actually coming out pretty soon.
