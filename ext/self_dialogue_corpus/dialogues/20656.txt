Hey do you want to do something?
I was just about to ask you the same thing!
My dad has a lot of movies if you want to watch one.
Sure, that sounds like fun to me.
Who is your favirote actor?
I would have to say Mel Gibson.
I like him as well, we have a lot of his movies!
Great! I have liked him ever since I saw We Were Soldiers.
Yes that was a wonderful movie.
Do you have that one?
No, but we have Braveheart and many others.
What about What Women Want?
Yes we do have that one. Want to watch it?
Maybe, what other movies of his do you have?
We also have A Man Without A Face.
Never seen that one before. Is it any good?
I enjoyed it quite a bit. It also has Elijah Wood in it as well.
I like him as well, lets go ahead and watch that one.
Sounds good, I think you will like it a lot.
I hope so, I will get the popcorn!
