You know what car I really want?
Ford Mustang.
Yep. Fast back 1967.
They modded that up so it will have 500 HP for the movie.
That's a lot of horses.
Did you know every single one of the mustangs used in the film survived? They were eventually auctioned off.
Are they even street legal? Thought they were like props or something.
no these were real street legal cars, all modded up for the movie.
I wonder how they went for?
They were auctioned off on ebay. They got between 14K to 22K for them
