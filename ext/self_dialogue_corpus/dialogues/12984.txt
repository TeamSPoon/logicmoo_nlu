What are all the novelizations they talk about?
They're novels based on the movies. George lucas commissioned them to be written.
And they're part of the whole Star Wars expanded universe?
Yes, for those who are not too familiar with them, it's kinda hard to follow because of the gaps in the stories.
Then there's the comics too
Yep, and tv series etc. They all contributed to the formation of the universe.
Then what's the Star Wars canon?
Like I said the Epxnded universe took 4 decades to evolve. And Lucas wanted to consolidate the whole thing.
So, that's why he rebranded most of them as Star Wars Legend in 2014?
yes. And he declared them mostly non-canon. So now the canon is the original trilogy, prequels, and the clone war animation series. All storiy lines must align with that canon set.
