Did you know the beatles went through a very spiritual phase?
I had heard something like that.. which songs were during that time?
Well I would argue for Instant Karma, but not sure.
Well Karma is certainly a spiritual message.
The other lyrics in about all shinning on speaks to reincarnation to me.
I never thought to much about it. But you are right it does convey that idea.
Swami Prabhupada had had a large influence on them especially george I think.
I think he had converted to hinduism even.
I believe that is correct. George was an interesting man.
I think each was so interesting in their own way.
