I just got into listening to Elvis.
How is that going?
I mean, I like some of them.
Which ones did you like?
I like the ones that feel sort of old.
Such as?
Like Blue Suede shoes.
The ones where he sings more than dances?
Yes, I like the dance ones too.
You know, he never really played the guitar.
Really?
Yes, he only knew three chords.
Is that why he only seems to be actual playing in some songs.
Yes.
What is his best song?
I like Love Me Tender.
Did he write it?
No, it was an old song called Unchained Melody.
I think I heard some of his gospel stuff too.
He said he enjoyed singing gospel more than anything.
