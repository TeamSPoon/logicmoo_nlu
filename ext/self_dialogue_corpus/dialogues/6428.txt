What's your favorite Disney movie?
I really liked Aladdin. Robin Williams as the Genie was the best character ever.
I like Aladdin too. Didn't they make a second one?
I think so, but it had a different person as the Genie and it wasn't as good.
Maybe they'll do a live version of Aladdin like they did with Beauty and the Beast.
I would be interested in that, but it could still be hard to cast for the Genie.
Some characters just can't be replaced.
What do you think about Lion King?
Great movie! It made me cry.
I think all Disney movies made me cry at some point.
