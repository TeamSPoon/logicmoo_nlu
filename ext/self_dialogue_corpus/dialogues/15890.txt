Do you pay attention to movie scores?
Sure, when the music really adds to what is going on. Like in The Hunger Games.
I am a huge collector of movie scores. I think I have, like, hundreds.
Wow, you're serious about this.
There is such amazing music out there, making films work better.
Do you have any favorite composers?
John Williams would be one. His score for Jaws got me started loving movie music.
I like the Hunger Games music - both the instrumental score and the songs they they used periodically throughout the series.
That song they used that Katniss sang - The Hanging Tree. That was so eerie and beautiful and sad all at once.
And the way they worked it into the score after she sang it, and it was really emotional.
There's the other song that Katniss sang to her sister in the first film, and it became a running theme.
I think this is how music becomes memorable music - when there is emotion attached to it.
I agree. The scores I like the most are music that really moved me or added an emotional layer to the action on the screen.
What other composers do you like?
Bernard Herrmann was an incredible composer. He did a wide range of music - North by Northwest, Mysterious Island, Psycho.
The score for Psycho creeped me out totally.
That was the idea. Did you know that the entire score is done with string instruments?
Oh man, I never realized that. No wonder it made my skin crawl sometimes.
Other composers I listen to are Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard.They cowrote the score for Batman Begins, which is an awesome score
I remember that music. It was really sweeping and powerful, a good complement to the action onscreen.
