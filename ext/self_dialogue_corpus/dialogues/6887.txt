Have you seen The Aristocats?
I did! It's my favorite cartoon.
I love the personalities of the kittens.
They are really cute, especially the white one.
Oh the white one. That's Marie, right?
Yeah, I think so. She's so funny.
The songs in that movie are so fun.
I always get "Everybody Wants to be a Cat" stuck in my head.
And don't they live in France or something like that?
I think so. The whole atmosphere is so fun.
