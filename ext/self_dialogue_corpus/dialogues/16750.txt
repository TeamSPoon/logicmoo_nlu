What's your opinion on 90's music?
I love it!
Me too, I was born in the late 80's so I grew up listening to 90's music.
What are some of your favorites from back then?
A lot actually, but some are Ace of Base or Backstreet Boys.
Oh I loved Backstreet boys in elementary school!
Me too! We would sing concerts at recess time.
Did you like the Spice Girls too?
Oh definitely! My friends and I would pretend we were each a Spice Girl.
I've done that before too with friends, it was a lot of fun.
Did you know that one of the Spice Girls married David Beckham?
Oh yes of course and now they have several kids together.
Do you remember the band NSYNC from the 90's?
Definitely! Another one of my favorite boy bands.
I especially liked Justin Timberlake. He did a great job actually on Trolls recently!
I loved that movie with my kids, had great music in it.
Yes I ended up buying my kids the soundtrack.
We have it also, listen to it wherever we go.
It does actually have good music on it though so not too bad.
Right, I agree. I enjoy the soundtrack also.
