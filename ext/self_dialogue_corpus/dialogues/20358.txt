My boyfriend and I are so different. We don't even like the same movies!
I hear you, I love horror movies, but he likes science fiction and comedic movies.
So how do you deal with it when deciding what to watch?
A lot of the time I will sit through his movies, and he'll sit through mine!
I can't do that, it sometimes feels torturous.
Also, sometimes the movies cross the genre borders.
What do you mean?
There are certain movies that blend horror and comedy, or horror and science fiction.
Oh I see, what are some examples?
Like Event Horizon. It's one of both our favorites.
Is that the one with Laurence Fishburn and Sam Neil.
Yes, it has elements from both the horror and scifi genres.
My favorite movies are romantic ones, and I can't get him to watch one with me!
I understand. Once he made me watch P.S. I Love You.
Really? HE made YOU watch a ROMANTIC movie?
Yep, those movies make me want to barf.
Well, maybe you will let me borrow him when the next romance comes out.
Ok, but don't get any ideas!
Well, maybe I'll try hypnosis on my boyfriend.
It's worth a shot, but don't try it on me!
