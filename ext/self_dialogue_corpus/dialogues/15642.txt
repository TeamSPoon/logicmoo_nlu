What do you think of the music of Gilbert and Sullivan?
I like the music but not the lyrics.
The lyrics are the best part! I am the very modle of a modern major general.
That may be but i'm not really a fan of the wimsical rhyming nonsense.
As oppossed to the masterful lyrics of today?
I'm not comparing it with pop music.  I just said that I don't like their lyrics as much as their music.
I like the lyrics better but I do agree that the tunes are memorable.
They really are the only composers of light opera that Ic an think of.
I agree. I can think of comic operas but not light opera.
I think comic opera is light opera.
You are probably right.
But, I think they are the last of the light opera composers.
Yeah, because most operas I can think of from the turn of the century (the last century) were serious.
Yes, like Madame Butterrfly.
Well you know that Gilbert and Sullivan are referred to as Savoy Opera.
Why?
Because they wrote for the Savoy theater owned by Richard D'Olyle Carte.
Did he own the hotel?
Yes, and that's why so many famous actors dined there.
Good to know.
