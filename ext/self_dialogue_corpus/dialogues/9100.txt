If you were going to make a list of songs for an "Evolution of Rock Music" playlist what would you choose?
Well, first I'd choose something by Elvis Presley.
Like "Hound Dog"?
Right, or "Devil In Disguise".
What next?
Then I think I'd choose something from the Rolling Stones.
Like "Paint It Black"?
Yeah, maybe.
And then who would you choose next?
"Rock and Roll" by Led Zeppelin seems like a good choice!
