I saw Furious 7 last night.
I hear they got a new director.
James Wan, replacing Justin Lin.
Didn't Walker die before finishing the movie?
Yes.  They used his younger brothers as stand ins to finish.
Crazy.  What's the plot?
The bad guy from 6 (Shaw) has a brother who vows vengeance on the gang.
Is Dwayne Johnson in this?
Yes.  He had a schedule conflict with Hercules but got it straightened out.
Nice.  I read the movie had  tribute to Walker.
