So who do you think is going to dominate the Grammy's this year?
That's a good question. There are a lot of people to choose from.
Yeah, we've had some good songs by Katy Perry, Justin Bieber, Lorde...
Taylor Swift might still be happening this year too.
Very true. It's been a few years since she last had an album out.
Yeah, and she put the duet with Zayn out this year. Maybe to test the waters?
I think so. I think it was to see how people responded to her still.
True. I would love to see how Justin Bieber does with all of the big hits he's had this year,
Despacito... I'm the One... He's definitely had some good ones to choose from.
Yeah and without Adele this year, it could be his time.
Don't forget about Ed Sheeran. I think he has a very good shot to dominate.
Agree with that too. Shape of You was massive, and he has some good hits from his album.
I wasn't too crazy for the album, there was about five songs I really liked but the rest I couldn't get into.
Which ones?
Happier, Perfect, Supermarket Flowers, Save Myself, and Shape of You.
What about Castle on the Hill?
It's alright. I liked it at first but I'm not as crazy now.
I see.
I'm just excited to see what all goes down.
Me too!
