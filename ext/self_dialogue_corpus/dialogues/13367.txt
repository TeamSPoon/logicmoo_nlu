Do you have a favorite character in the Star Wars movie series?
Han Solo always seemed to be a very heroic, funny character.
There was chemistry between Han Solo and Princess Leia.
You think so? They were so far apart in age.
I always loved the deep voice of Darth Vader in the first movies.
I believe that voice is spoken by James Earl Jones. Do you know him?
James Earl Jones is a great actor. The later Darth Vader actors were not as convincing.
The outfit too was pretty wild for the times. Very scary and dark. What did you think of Yoda?
I thought the special effects could have been better with Yoda. Do you believe in The Force?
I think there is something beyond science that we cannot explain. That's one reason I love Star Wars.
