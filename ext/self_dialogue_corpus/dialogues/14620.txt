Who's better, LeBron or Jordan?
Are you kidding me?
What? That's a serious question.
Of course the answer is Jordan. It's not even close.
Not even close? That's not fair at all.
What's so great about LeBron?
I think he's a better overall player.
He's a better passer and he's a bigger guy.
Right. He's more versatile than Jordan. Jordan was mainly a scorer.
But that doesn't make him better. Jordan was a much better leader.
I think a lot of the leadership on Jordan's teams came from Phil Jackson.
Phil played a big part for sure. But Jordan was a major force as well.
People often compare LeBron to Magic, but I don't think that's a good fit.
I kind of agree with that. He's not quite Magic, and he's not quite Jordan.
Yeah, he's something in between.
One thing that always bothered me about LeBron was that he never entered the Dunk Contest.
You know, I've always wondered about that.
Why did he never compete?
He said one time that he didn't want to take the spotlight away from other players in the contest.
I think that sounds like a lame excuse.
