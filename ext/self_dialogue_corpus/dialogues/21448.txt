Did you like the movie?
It was better than I thought
The movie didn't have many cheesy or stupid scenes.
Yeah. I'm glad that they didn't have any love scenes. Sometimes a love scene destroys a good movie.
But I thought the scene where the girl was washing her hair and Tom Cruise came to say good bye was stupid. Why did they have that there? It didn't make sense.
I agree. They didn't need that scene
When you are talking about good movies versus great movies, each and every scene counts
But besides those one or two scenes, the movie was great
I liked almost everything about it. I really liked the samurai that was beating up Cruise in the beginning of the movie. The guy second in command. He was cool too.
Every movie has a guy like him. They try to make him awesome even though they don't say much.
I don't understand why Tom Cruise went back to that village. If he was the only survivor, wouldn't that make everyone suspicious about where his loyalty lies?
It was clear in the movie that he loved the place and the samurais. Clearly everyone knows that he isn't a traitor. I would have done the same thing in his position
I guess I think so too.
But isn't it suspicious that he is the only survivor?
Well, all the samurais were looking for a death in battle. Cruise wasn't.
But only the boss received the satisfaction of being killed with the sword. Nobody else did.
That is true.
I guess we can agree to disagree on certain points.
Overall though, we both found some things in the film that we liked, right?
Right! I'm glad that we went
