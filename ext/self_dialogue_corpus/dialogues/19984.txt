Have you ever heard of "Jim Sullivan?"
The Sheepdogs have a song called "Jim Sullivan". Is that about him?
I don't know. I tried looking it up, but didn't get an answer.
Was he a musician?
Yes. He had an album in 1969 called "UFO".
Did he have any hits?
No, but he had a song called "Johnny" that could have been a hit if the radio stations had played it.
That's what the media does to thousands of people : ignore them.
It's all about the money. Jim Sullivan was a popular performer in California, and decided in 1975 to head for Memphis.
Looking for studio work?
It's hard to tell. He had a wife and kid and started driving to Memphis one day.
Was he a rocker or a country player?
A little bit of both. He played guitar and wrote his own music.
I don't think I ever heard of him. Did he join any other groups or just stay solo?
He disappeared in 1975. In the desert somewhere, I think in Arizona.
What? What happened?
The police had stopped his car because he was falling asleep behind the wheel, so he stayed at a motel one night.
And then what happened?
His car was found the next morning with his guitar in the back seat, abandoned alongside of the desert.
Did the U.F.Os pick him up?
