Alright, who's your pick for Superbowl this year.
Ha, ha we haven't even started pre-season yet.
Yeah, well still.  You must have some idea about who will be the best.
It will probably be New England again.
You think?  I don't know.  They are starting to get old.
Are you kidding.  That don't seem to affect that team. They just find a way to win.
That's the truth.  Well I think it will be Denver for the AFC and Dallas for the NFC with the Cowboys winning.
In your dreams. Denver might get there but the Cowboys?
Hey, they were supposed to be there last year but had a couple bad snags.
Yeah, like loosing their QB.
Well, we found a diamond in the ruff though and this year he will be even better.
Well, we'll see.  I think that Carolina and Arizona will be tough to beat this year.
Can't count Green bay out either.  Ever.
That's true.  Rogers is still at the helm so anything can happen there.
Yeah, it's getting about time for him to retire too ain't it?
Yeah, he is probably getting close.  I think over the next couple of years there will be several greats that will retire.
I know.  It's hard to believe that some of these guys have been in now for 12, 15 years now.
Yeah, like Rothlessburger and what's his name down in New Orleans.
Drew Breeze.
Yeah. Him too.
