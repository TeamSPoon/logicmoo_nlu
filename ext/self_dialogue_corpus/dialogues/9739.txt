Did you like the new Kendrick Lamar?
Which one?
I think it was called DNA.
Oh yeah, that album was hot.
I think he might be the best out right now
He uses a crazy vocabulary in his rhymes
You can tell hes educated
I dont know about that, but he puts thought into his rhymes.
He says stuff no other rapper is talking about
Thats what sets him apart I believe.
