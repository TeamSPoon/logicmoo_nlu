Have you ever seen David Bowie in a movie?
Only in Labyrinth many years ago.
I just watched a great film from the early '80s called Merry Christmas Mr. Lawrence. It's Japanese.
He was in a Japanese movie?
Yes, surprisingly. He plays a prisoner of war in a Japanese prison camp during World War 2.
Does he play a Briton?
No, a South African. The film does a good job at showing Japanese and British culture's perspectives towards war.
Is his character Mr. Lawrence?
No, Mr. Lawrence is played by Tom Conti. He plays a beautiful role in trying to bridge the cultural gap between the Brits and Japanese in the movie.
How was David Bowie's performance?
Quite touching, actually, with a lot of nuance brought to the character. Another standout role was Ryuichi Sakamoto as a Japanese captain.
Isn't Sakamoto a music composer? Same guy?
Yes, that's him! He also scored the movie and even won a BAFTA for it.
Wow, Sakamoto and David Bowie on the same film's score must have been a gift for the ears.
Unfortunately, David Bowie was not involved in the soundtrack at all.
What a waste!
You should still give the film a try. It is a beautifully sensitive film that will sit with you long after you've watched it.
Brotherhood is a concept that always makes me feel like someone has been cutting onions!
Prepare yourself. Don't watch it around your girlfriend.
Noted!
