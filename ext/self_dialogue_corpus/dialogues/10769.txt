Do you enjoy the fast and the furious movies?
Yes they were very exciting!
I am so sad though now that paul walker died.
That is terrible! He was so handsome.
Vin diesel was good in the movies too.
I should really watch them again just to see those to racing their cars really fast.
I agree, Tokyo drift was ok
All of the movies before that one were great!
Really went downhill after paul walker
Yep, he held everything together.
