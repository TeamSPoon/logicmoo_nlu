You interested in Jingle All The Way?
Oh yes! I love that movie.
My son watched that so many times.
That is a really good movie.
Everything he goes through to get a toy.
I know I think I may have given up.
Fighting with that guy over a Turbo Man.
At least in the end he gets one.
You like Arnold Schwarzenegger?
Yeah he is pretty cool.
I like him in the Expendables.
That is a pretty good movie.
A lot of stars.
Yes you also have Sylvester Stallone.
Yes Sylvester Stallone was going to bring the girl home with home.
She got shot though.
It was a shame.
She was helping him and got shot.
I liked all three Expendables.
Do you know if there is any more?
