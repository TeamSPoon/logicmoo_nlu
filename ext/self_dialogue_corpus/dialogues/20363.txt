Are you a Kevin Smith fan?
Yes, love his stuff.
Then you should check out Yoga Hosers.
What? That doesn't sound like a Kevin Smith movie.
It is, he made it with his daughter Harley.
So it's a kid's movie?
Oh no, more like teen horror comedy.
Really, sounds like a Canadian yoga workout.
It's a really goofy movie but it's fun.
So not like your typical Kevin Smith film?
No, not really. It's pretty out there.
What's it about?
Harley and her friend, played by Johnny Depp's daughter, work in a convenient store and one night, weird stuff starts happening.
Like what?
All I'll say is that involves little mini bratwurst men.
Say what now?
And they're played by Kevin Smith.
Well, I have to say, I'm intrigued.
You should be, check it out when you're looking for something ridiculous to watch.
I think I might just do that, thanks.
