I'M THINKING OF GOING TO SEE "TRANSFORMERS: THE LAST KNIGHT". DO YOU WANT TO COME?
ISN'T MARK WAHLBERG IN IT?
YES HE IS AND I HEAR HE IS AWESOME!
I HAVE A HARD TIME SEEING MOVIES THAT HAVE SEVERAL SEQUELS.
IT IS STILL A GREAT ACTION MOVIE!
I WAS THINKING MOVE OF SEEING "WONDER WOMAN"
I SAW THE TRAILER FOR IT BUT I KEPT WAITING FOR LYNDA CARTER TO SHOW UP.
OH I LIKED LYNDA CARTER TOO AND HER COSTUME WAS AWESOME!
NOW WE HAVE TO DECIDE BETWEEN "TRANSFORMERS" AND "WONDER WOMAN"
TRUE, ANOTHER "TRANSFORMERS" OR A NEW "WONDER WOMAN"
I STILL VOTE "TRANSFORMERS"!
WHAT ABOUT GOING TO SEE "THE HOUSE"?
WAIT! YOU'RE CHANGING THE CHOICES! I WANT TO SEE AN ACTION MOVIE!
BUT WE CAN'T DECIDE WHICH ONE BECAUSE WE DON'T LIKE THINGS ABOUT THEM.
"THE HOUSE"?  I DON'T LIKE HORROR MOVIES.
WAIT! WHAT?  "THE HOUSE IS A COMEDY ABOUT A CASINO HIDDEN IN A HOUSE!
ARE YOU SURE?  SOUNDS LIKE A HORROR MOVIE TO ME
THIS IS MAKING ME CRAZY!  I'M GOING TO STAY HERE AND WATCH A MOVIE CLASSIC LIKE "LOST HORIZON"
I LOVE CLASSIC MOVIES! WE CAN WATCH THE ORIGINAL "FRANKENSTEIN" AFTER THAT
NOW YOU'RE TALKING!  I'LL MAKE THE POPCORN!
