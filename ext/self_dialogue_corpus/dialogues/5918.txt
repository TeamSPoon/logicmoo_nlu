Well several disney movies  just feel like filler
What does that mean
It means they do not feel fully fleshed out
Give me an example
The lion king two is a perfect example
But i liked it
It was ok but it forgot the impact of the first
Why do you think that
Nothing was as touching or memorable
Maybe it could be
