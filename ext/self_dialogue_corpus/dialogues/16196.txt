I need some new bands to listen to. Can you give me something I haven't heard before?
You came to the right person. Have you ever heard Pinback?
I never heard of them before. What kind of music are they?
They're indie, but very experimental in what they do.
That sounds pretty interesting. How are they experimental?
They do things that no one else does. They're a 3 piece band that sounds like more than 3 members.
What songs should I listen to?
You should check out Fortress. Its my favorite song from them.
I will as soon as I get home. What albums would you say are the best?
My personal favorites are probably their self-titled, and Summer In Abaddon.
I'll make sure I listen to them soon.
I will warn you. Their lyrics can be a little weird at times.
I don't necessarily mind that, but what do you mean?
I'll just say that sometimes the lyrics don't make much sense. They're just a really fun band to listen to.
I'm very interested. I can't wait to listen to them.
The best thing about them is that the bassist kind of emulates a second guitar, but still gives them the much needed low end.
I love when bassists try to go above and beyond the normal duty of a bass.
Me too. This is why I'm so in love with them.
Thank you for the suggestion!
Any time. I am always happy to help with recommendations.
