What current pop song do you think will still be playing 30 years from now?
Ooh, nice. We still have a lot from the 80s that are well-known.
I think anything by Adele will be around for a generation or two, easy.
Yeah, her voice is transcendent.
Nice analysis. Yours?
"Shut up and dance"
Why that one?
It's the perfect dancing song that isn't obnoxious techno that you'd hear in a club, and it's still pop.
The video is amazing.
I think I'm in love with the girl in the video.
