There are some pretty bad movies out there this year.
Isn't that always the case? Enterprising filmmakers have been cranking out horrible stuff for decades.
Do you know of any films that are so bad they're good?
Sure. The one that comes immediately to mind is Plan 9 From Outer Space by Ed Wood.
Wait, that name is familiar...there was a movie about him some years back, with Johnny Depp. I didn't see it though.
Yes, that was the movie Ed Wood. I think Depp really captured the guy.
So who was this Ed Wood?
The real Ed Wood was this earnest, good-natured, cross-dressing, profoundly untalented director from back in the 50s. He made several movies.
How does a no-talent guy make more than one movie?
Perseverance, I think. Plus he cultivated a friendship with Bela Lugosi, who by that time was an old washed up has-been.
They were actual friends?
Yes, and Ed put Lugosi in several of his movies. Go see the movie Ed Wood, and you'll get an idea of how they were.
So tell me about Plan 9 From Outer Space.
It's about space aliens who turn corpses into zombies to take over the world. It is hilariously bad.
What makes it so funny?
The dialogue is just awful. But the movie is so sincere - Ed was really trying to make a masterpiece.
I guess you have to admire the guy for getting films made.
I remember the first time I saw Plan 9, at about 3 in the morning with a couple of buddies who had memorized all the dialogue and would quote whole scenes during the commercials.
Wow, what a movie memory!
Yeah, Plan 9 and car ads from Cal Worthington in the middle of the night. You can't get any more entertaining than that.
