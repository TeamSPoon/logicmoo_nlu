What was the last comedy you saw?
I'm really more into 80s comedies, so I just rewatched Big.
I love that movie! Tom Hanks was hilarious in it.
I know, he did such a good job acting like an overgrown kid.
But then again, Tom Hanks is great in anything.
He was also really good in that other movie Sleepless in Seattle.
I personally thought he was best in A League of Their Own.
That movie had such a great cast!
I know, Geena Davis and Rosie and Madonna did a really good job.
Now I want to re-watch it.
