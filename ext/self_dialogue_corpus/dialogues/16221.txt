Hey what are you listening to?
Hi.  I'm listening to 'Despacito,' by Luis Fonsi.
I love that song!
It is unbelievably catchy.  And I love reggaeton and other Latin music.
I didn't know that about you.  Also, didn't Justin Bieber sing that song?
No.  Originally, it was by Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee, but Justin did a cover with them in English.
Oh I see.  It's cool that they did that.
I agree.  The collaboration definitely boosted the popularity of the song even more than before.
Bieber's influence, whether you like him or not, seems to be quite far-reaching.
That is an understatement.  Did you know by the way this was the first song primarily in Spanish to top the Billboard 100 since "Macarena?"
I didn't know that.  I can't believe it has been that long since a Spanish language song got on Billboard.
I'm really happy about it.  It's a great genre that more people should appreciate.
What other songs or artists do you listen to in the genre?
Well the featured artist in 'Despacito,' Daddy Yankee, I really like.  His song 'Senorita' with Reykon is one of my favorites.
I think I've heard of Reykon before.
He's very popular so you probably have.  That song I just mentioned is another example of Reggaeton.
Is that different from something like 'Danza Kuduro?'  That song I really liked.
Yes, it's very different.  I think they're both technically reggaeton, but 'Danza Kuduro' almost had elements of meregue in it.
What are other examples of Merengue?
'Si Te Vas' by Omega might fall under that category too.
