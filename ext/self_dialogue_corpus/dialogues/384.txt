Did you ever see that movie Mystery Men that came out in the 90's?
Wasn't that the one with Ben Stiller.
Yep, that's the one.  Massive bomb at the box office.
Doesn't surprise me.  It looked horrible to start.
I think it had a Smash Mouth song in it if I remember correctly.
I think you're right.  That's a pretty good memory you have.
Well, I'm pretty good at remembering really unimportant facts.
The fact that you remembered this movie is pretty impressive.
Like I said, it's a gift.
Your mother must be very proud of you.
