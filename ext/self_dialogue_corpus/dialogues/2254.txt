Who do you think will be the surprise team this year?
I like Houston a lot. Adding Deshaun Watson was big for them.
Do you really think they'll improve over last year with a rookie QB?
They finished 9-7 last year and first in their division with a terrible QB
But there's no telling if Watson will be any improvement over terrible
I think you'l be surprised at how good he is. The guy wins ball games.
If he does have a good year, then they definitely have a team that can win a lot of games.
Last year they were without JJ Watt for much of the season.
So having Watt and Watson this year means they're due for an improvement.
Having a winning QB, which I think Watson will be, along with a stellar defense is the key to making it to the Super Bowl.
But they have to go through New England to get there.
Watson will be able to win 2-3 games on his own. I can't wait to see him run through defenses.
Do you think he'll be rookie of the year?
Yes. He'll put up very good stats for a rookie QB and I believe he'll lead the Texans to 13-14 wins.
I'll be shocked if he's able to put up good numbers. There's a reason he was taken number 12 with two other QBs ahead of him.
Scouts and GMs are obsessed with mechanics and potential to be a prototypical QB; Watson is not that.
Then what is he if he's not prototypical.
He's a Cam Newton type QB who is capable of winning games without filling up the stat sheet.
I hope so. Houston has been good for three years now, but they've finished 9-7 each time.
This is the year they either break out of that with the best record, or they falter with Watson.
