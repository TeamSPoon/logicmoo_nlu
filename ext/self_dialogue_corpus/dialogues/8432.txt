Have you heard any good pop music on the radio lately?
Eh...not really.  I've been listening Pandora lately.  I have Robin Schulz as a channel and it's been pretty good for working out
I've heard Schulz's remix of Prayer in C, what else does he have that's worth listening to?
Sugar is quite good.  Funny video.  Features some teenage Canadian singer.. can't remember his name exactly, but it's Yates
What other songs are on there?
I've heard Jasmine Thompson and a few others.  There's a dance remix of Wicked Games on there which is pretty good.
Parra for Cuva?
Yep.  That sound familiar.  They also have some remixes of older songs as well.
Oh? like what?  That sounds interesting
I just heard a remix of Is You or Is You Aint My Baby by Dinah Washington and Spooky by Dusty Springfield.
