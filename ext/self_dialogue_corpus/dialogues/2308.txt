What are your thoughts on the upcoming NFL season?
I am an Arizona fan so I care about the NFC West.
Who won that last year?
The Seahawks won the NFC West in 2016.
How did the Cardinals do?
They under performed and did not even make the playoffs.
What was their main problem.
Surprisingly, place kicking really hurt them.
How did that happen?
They lost at least two games where field goals that should have been made would have won the game for them.
Any other problems?
The defense also did not produce as expected.
What was wrong with them.
They had one great corner and the other one was always vulnerable.
How does the upcoming season look for them?
Hopes are high  because Carson Palmer can still produce and Larry Fitzgerald was as productive as ever last season.
How about the defense?
They lost one good lineman but have shored that position up.
What about corner back?
The added some depth there and should be much better.
