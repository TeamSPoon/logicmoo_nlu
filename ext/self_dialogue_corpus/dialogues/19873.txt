So have you heard heard Miley Cyrus's new single yet?
You mean Wrecking Ball?
Dude, you gotta get with the time, Wrecking Ball was a couple years ago.
Wait, seriously? Whoa, I had no idea.
Yep. Her most recent song is called Malibu.
Is this one as raunchy as her last one?
No, actually, she's gone back to a bit more of the country style.
That's certainly a style shift.
Well, she's had a lot of those in her career.
True. Hannah Montana years were very different from what she became.
My kid was obsessed with her when she was younger, it's a shame she went nuts.
Well, maybe she's coming back. What's Malibu like?
Well, like I said it's much more country-pop. Like a slightly more sultry Taylor Swift.
Miley's got a great voice for that; it's nice and rich.
Yeah, she could have really rivaled Tswift if she'd stayed in that zone, I think.
Are the rest of her songs going to be in that vein, or?
Sounds like it. In an interview she said she's 'no longer' the person in her old music.
Not surprised. She did a full one eighty when she came out with her last album, and now she's balancing that.
Well, if the rest of her songs are like Malibu, I think she's finally figured something out.
Nice, I'll have to check it out!
