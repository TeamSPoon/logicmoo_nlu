Who do you think the coolest character in Star Wars is?
I think that would be Darth Vader.
I agree. He has so much depth.
I like him in the first movie the most.
That's a good point. He is not accompanied by that overused theme.
I wonder how the idea of Vader was thought of.
I am not sure. I wonder who came up with the idea.
Well, it was probably George Lucas.
Do you think they should have made Vader turn back to the light side?
No, he should have remained evil the whole time.
