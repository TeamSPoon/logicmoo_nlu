Who's your favorite pop artist that people don't know?
Abra Moore!
Who is that?
Exactly.
Right, I got you. Tell me about her.
She had an album out in 1997 and had just one mini-hit.
What was that?
Four Leaf Clover.
Not sure I know what it sounds like.
Again, that's what you asked. She has another album in 1995 that was good, an unreleased album, and two more that didn't chart.
