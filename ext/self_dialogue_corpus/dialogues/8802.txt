I just found my old Soundgarden CDs.
Oh wow. You still have those?
Yeah, I looked for them after Chris Cornell died. Were you into Soundgarden or Temple of the Dog?
I liked them both. I was more of a Nirvana and Pixies fan at the time.
Oh I love Nirvana. What's your favorite album.
Nevermind, of course! That album is a classic!
Yeah but some of the earlier stuff is good and In Utero was pretty good too.
Yeah. I was just reading a Spin article where Kurt Cobain was placed as one of the top 100 guitarists of all time.
Hm, yeah I'd say so. He didn't shred all that much but the songs were good.
Kim from Soundgarden was also on the list of top guitarists. I miss 90s rock!
