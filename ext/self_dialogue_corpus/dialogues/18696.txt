Do you like Radiohead?
I do actually.
What's your favorite song of theirs?
Probably creep, how about you?
Good choice, street spirit.
Also a good choice.
Do you think we'll ever find another artist like them?
Maybe but doubtful they're fairly unique.
I think all musicians are pretty unique in a way.
Each one creates their own style of music.
It's beautiful isn't it.
Yes it is.
Like any other songs?
I like Karma Police.
Haven't heard of that one surprisingly.
How about Paranoid Andoird?
I know that one, not a big fan of it though.
I like it.
We each have our own tastes that's for sure.
yes we do.
