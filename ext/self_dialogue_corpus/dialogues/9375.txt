What era of Rap do you like best?
You can't even compare rap today with the 90's.
I know what you mean.  Today you have Little Wayne, drake, etc.
They can't even wipe the shoes of the Wu Tang, Dre, Beastie Boys, Nas, etc
What about the Fugees album?
That was one of the best hip hop albums of all time.
What about the Chronic by Dre.  That might actually be the best rap album of all time.
Everyone song on that Album was great.
Don't forget the Notorious BIG
He was amazing.  The song Warning is one of the best of all time.
