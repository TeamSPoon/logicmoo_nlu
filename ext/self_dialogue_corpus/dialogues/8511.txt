You know who is super talented?
Who are you talking about?
Adam Levine. He sounds good all by himself and good in a group.
You are so right! I love his song "Locked Up".
Yes it's the kind of song you can listen to again and again.
I know. The lyrics get stuck in my head.
Me too! I love it though.
He's great in Maroon 5 too!
Yes I think one of my favorite songs is "Moves like Jagger."
Yes it's a very catchy song!
