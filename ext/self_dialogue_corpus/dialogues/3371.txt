I loved An American Werewolf in London
For the time period it was made, yeah it was pretty good.
Would you call it a comedy
No I would say its horror with comedy mixed in.
But not like a scary movie.
No, I liked the idea of the guy never knowing when hes going to turn into a werewolf.
Thats sort of a scary proposition.
No its really scary and well put together
The acting by David Naughton was top notch.
It was one of his finest works.
