I love Fight Club.
It was my favorite for a while
Did you like Pitt or Norton?
Pitt was better in it.
I think you could empathize with Norton's character though.
Yeah you could, he played a weird role.
It was very depressing for awhile
Didnt Meatloaf play in that movie?
He did, though it wasnt a starring role.
Leto played a crazy character too.
Yeah all around it was a crazy film
The idea of blowing up a credit building was innovative?
I liked the way it was shot in some elements.
Yeah the cinematography was cool.
Do you think they could do another one?
I mean if he struggles with himself again yes,
But I feel like he killed that part of himself.
No, you never can physically do that
He did when he put a gun in his mouth
Technically he did not, so I dont know.
