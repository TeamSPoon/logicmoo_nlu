Are you looking forward to the Hans Solo movie?
I am now that Ron Howard is directing it!
Is he? No way! I hadn't hear that.
Yeah! I have more confidence in it now.
I don't think I actually care about the early life of Hans Solo.
Well, maybe we can learn about how he met Chewbaca?
I haven't enjoyed the prequels at all, and this one doesn't look like it'll be better.
But you liked Rogue one!
That's true. That one was good.
But, everyone isn't going to die at the end of this one!
