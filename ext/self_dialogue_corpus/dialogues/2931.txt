Lonnie Devers just got married.
He did?
Yep.  They said after winning the Super Bowl, he decided to do it.
Who'd he marry?
His college sweetheart.
That's so sweet.
He basically won the Bowl for his team.
Wow.
I guess success makes men settle down!
Ha ha.
So maybe he will play better than ever now.
That would be exciting.
How many touchdowns does he have so far this season?
I think he's at 7.
Man, he's good.
He will probably finish with 20-25.
He's one of the best.
I'm so proud of him.
Me too.
I'll be watching.
