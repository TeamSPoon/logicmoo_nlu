Who is your favorite character in Star Wars?
That's a tough questions. I think Obi Wan is my favorite.
I like Obi Wan a lot too although he is responsible for helping train Darth Vadar.
Ya that's a good point he didn't always make the best choices.
I think it would have been better if he had listened to Yoda.
Ya yoda did warn him not to train Anikan but then he insisted because of the death of Qui Gon Jinn
Ya I guess Obi Wan didn't want to train him at first.
Ya that's a good point. Without Qui Gon Anakin would have stayed with him mom.
Ya maybe he would have been happier if he had never left to become a Jedi.
That's a great point and then he would have been there to save hiis mom.
