Have you heard of the band SHinedown?
Yes, I have heard of them.
They're really a great band.
I don;t know too much about them.
They are a rock band, kind of came into the spotlight recently.
Oh really? How was that?
They made a big splash by making music for the first Expendables movie.
Oh really? Which song was that?
It was called diamond eyes.
Oh yeah?
Yes,  It was part of their sound of madness album.
Sounds very good.
Yes it was. It kind of helped to lay the scene for the movie.
That would defiitely help a band.
It did, It really helped propel the band.
Thats fantastic.
Yeah, and it took a while, but they're really making it now.
It took a while?
Yeah, they were formed in 2001.
