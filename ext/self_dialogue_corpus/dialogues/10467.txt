Hi, how was your weekend?
Hi, it was great! I went to see a movie.
What movie is it?
The new Pirates of the Caribbean.
Is it a good movie? Do you like it?
Well, I feel the storyline is somehow boring, but I like the music in the movie.
Yeah, I watched the previous movies in the same franchise. I am really impressed by the music.
Ah, are you also a fan of this movie franchise?
Not really though. I used to like the actor Johnny Depp very much. However, since his divorce, I do not like him very much.
I see. Well, I cannot comment on Johnny Depp's personal traits, but his performance in the movie franchise is absolutely fantastic.
I agree. I like the actors' performance and the music in the Pirates of Caribbean series.
Have you heard about Hans Zimmer?
Is he the music and sound composer of Pirates of the Caribbean?
Yeah, he has many famous works but Pirates of the Caribbean is one of those fantastic ones.
What other movies has he involved in?
There are a lot, such as The Lion King and The Dark Knight.
The Dark Knight? That is one of my favorite movies ever!
Interesting to know that. I also like the new Batman's movie a lot. The director is Christopher Nolan.
I know him. I am a big fan.
Great. He is directing a new movie Dunkirk. Let's go and watch it together in this summer.
