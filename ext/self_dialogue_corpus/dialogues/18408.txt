What musical has the best soundtrack of all time, would you say?
Les Miserables, hands down!
Wow, that was a quick answer.
I just really like the music. Both lyrically and the melodies behind it.
What's your favorite song from it?
Oh man, that's a tough thing to try to answer. There are so many great ones.
I have always been fond of 'On my Own'.
Yes, I think for a lot of people that's their favorite.
But not you?
For a while it was, but I kind of moved on. It got a bit overplayed.
Yeah, it's sad when that happens to music you like a lot. You end up ruining it by listening to too much of it.
I think maybe my favorite song is 'Empty Chairs and Empty Tables'.
That song is so sad!
Yeah, it's not a cheerful song. But it's very beautiful, and I can relate to the sentiment.
What is the sentiment.
It's a person who is alive mourning those who have died and wondering why he is alive while they are not.
That's pretty morbid.
Definitely. But again, I can relate to it.
I prrefer happier music, generally.
Me too, but for some reason that song really works for me.
