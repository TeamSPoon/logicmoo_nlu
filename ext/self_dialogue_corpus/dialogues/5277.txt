Have you checked out Avengers?
Yes, with all those super heroes around, it was on my 'to watch' list before its release.
Well then good news for you, as Avengers: Infinity War is on the cards?
When does it release?
As per the initial reports around April 2018.
That seems to far and a long wait.
You haven't heard it all. It is a two-part movie.
What?!! Do part 1 and 2 release together?
No, so far I know only about part 1 releasing in April 2018
Reminds me of Harry Potter's last book and movies which were divided into two parts. A long wait then for part 2.
