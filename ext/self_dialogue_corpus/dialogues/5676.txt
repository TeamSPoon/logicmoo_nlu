What are your top disney films?
I think there anImated Peter Pan was really great!
For me the later Hook film surpassed this film.
Not really comparable. One was Animated and the original story more or less. Hook was totally original plot.
I still think it was better than the animated film version.
Was it even a disney film though?
Spielberg began developing the film in 1980s with Walt Disney Productions. But stopped work then later brought it out on his own I think.
So to my point not really the same world. I want to know your disney pic?
I always thought The Lion King was a disney masterpiece. Original story for them too.
It was great. You seem to appreciate an original story more than a rendition of an existing fairytale.
