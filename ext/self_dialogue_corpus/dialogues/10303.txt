I like will smith in his action roles
They are a bit different than what i am used to
I know it is a bit off kilter
huh
You know odd seeing him in those roles
Well yeah he is know as funny man
And then he plays these action roles so well though
True he played deadshot perfecty
It was the best part of the movie
Without a shadow of a doubt
