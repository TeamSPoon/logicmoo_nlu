Do you remember watching the Lion King?
I remember going to the theater as a kid.
Do you remember much from the actual movie?
Not a lot other than some of Simba's experiences.
I watched it recently.
How was it.
It is so great to watch a movie as an adult that I only saw as a kid.
What was it like.
It was like watching a new movie, I really enjoyed it.
Interesting, I will probably give it a watch, thank you for mentioning it.
