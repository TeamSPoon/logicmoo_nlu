You know what I don't understand about Lady Gaga?
No. I personally don't know much about her.
Well, she has a pretty voice but she often doesn't display it. She sometimes sings with this mannish voice.
Like in Poker Face?
Exactly. Songs like You and I display her pretty voice.
I haven't heard that one.
It's on her Born This Way album. I'll play it for you.
OK. Then I can hear what you mean.
I wish she'd sing the good way all the time.
Madonna does something like this too. I have the same thought about her.
