I know Lady Gaga is a controversial figure. But, is her music controversial also?
I think so.
Why do you think that?
Some of her songs bring up issues people would rather not talk about.
Can you give me an example?
She has stated that "Poker Face" is about her sexuality.
Wow, that's kind of heavy.
Yes, it's a consistent theme in her work as are equal rights.
It does seem like both she and her music are controversial then.
Yes, I think she's using her music as way to express beliefs.
