Did you see the movie Malificent?
Yes I did. Angelina Jolie was pretty convincing as Malificent.
Yes She was. She looked pretty scary.
I wanted to take my grandkids but I though it may be a little scary for them.
Yes could be.
The special effects were really good.
It was a good spinoff on Sleeping Beauty.
Yea, Disney movies can't be beat.
The animation in the animated ones is amazing.
Generally you are never disappointed in a Disney film.
