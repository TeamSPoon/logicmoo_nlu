What is your favorite Star Wars Movie?
Rogue One
Why
I liked the Death Star.
It was a great weapon.
I don't think you can fire lasers and blow up planets.
It is a little far fetched.
I like the concept of a round space station.
It makes sense, just hard to make something that big.
It would be expensive.
