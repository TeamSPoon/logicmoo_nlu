Yeah i followed him his entire career, he definitely changed the game.
Who is your favorite New York artist?
I'm a big fan of Jay-Z as well but i also like Jadakiss as well.
Jadakiss can always br counted on to bring some fire to a track.
Yeah it doesn't matter who he raps with, he is usually the stand out artist on a song.
How do you feel about Nas?
I think he is a talented artist, i just wish he was more consistent.
That is so true but you can't take away from the fact the illmatic is one of the best rap albums ever.
