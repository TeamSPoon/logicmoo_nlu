What bands have you been into recently?
Not too much new but I've been really getting into older Alice In Chains stuff.
Yes, I haven't listened to them in a while but they were really good. It's too bad about their singer dying.
Yeah, Layne Staley had an amazing voice. Jerry Cantrell is still keeping them going and they got a new singer who also sounds really good.
I wish I could have seen them in concert back when they were in their prime.
Definitely so. They are still touring but it's not the same as seeing them back when they were at their best.
Out of all the bands that came out of Seattle, Alice In Chains was probably the best.
That's a matter of opinion. There were a lot of good bands from that city in the day but yeah, they're up there for sure.
What's your favorite Alice In Chains song?
That's tough to say but right now I have been listen to the song Would a lot so I'd say that one. Ask me again in a week and I'll probably have a different favorite.
