I just got a Spotify account. Can you recommend some new artists for me?
Sure, I'm really into Ed Sheeran these days.
What does he sing? His name sounds familiar.
He sings Shape of You, Thinking out loud, Castle on the Hill.
I think I've heard of him before.
Yes, he used to be good friends with Taylor Swift.
Oh I love Taylor Swift. Her album "Red" is one of my favorites.

I'll definitely have to look him up. What album do you reccomend?
My favorite is x but his newest is divide.
