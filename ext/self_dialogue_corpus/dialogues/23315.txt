Are you by any chance a fan of superhero movies?
Yeah, I'd say I am.
Okay, now who would you say releases better movies? Marvel or DC?
That's easy. Marvel, because they release more consistently good ones. DC has more or less always been hit or miss with their movies.
Marvel hasn't always been good either.
I know they haven't. The Blade and Ghost Rider series still exist, remember?
Oh, dear. Those were terrible!
Exactly. All I'm saying is that Marvel releases far more good movies than bad ones.
Thinking of it now, I can see what you mean about DC being more hit or miss.
Right? Good example would be that while the Christopher Nolan Batman films were all great, movies like Batman & Robin and Superman III were awful.
And Marvel has really been on fire lately. They really haven't released one bad movie yet.
They've all been consistently good since the start of their cinematic universe thing, or whatever it's called.
What do you think about DC's cinematic universe?
They have all the material ready to go, but the execution has been pretty poor.
So I take it that means you don't like any of those movies?
No, I don't. So far, they've all been disappointing.
I thought that Batman v. Superman wasn't nearly as bad as people have said it is.
It's not that bad, but it's still very disappointing. The storytelling in that movie was just so all over the place.
To be honest, I didn't pay that much attention to it. I was just there to see Ben Affleck's Batman.
Well, to be fair, he did do a great job as Batman.
