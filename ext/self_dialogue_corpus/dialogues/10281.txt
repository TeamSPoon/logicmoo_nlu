So, Mark, what's the best action movie of all time?
Easy, it's Gladiator. Great hero, great effects, exciting action.
Yeah, great effects, those digital animals in the arena were  amazing! But I preferred those Bruce Willis ones.
You mean all those Die Hard movies. He's gonna be making one when he dies.
And I'm going to be watching that one when I die.
Don't you think he's kind of old for an action hero?
Tom Cruise is too short for an action star, Danny DeVito is too ugly, and Jason Statham is too bad at acting. So what?
Jason Statham is an excellent actor. Did you see his movie War? It's epic.
Nah, I never saw it.
Well, hey, I've got it right here. Let's watch it.
