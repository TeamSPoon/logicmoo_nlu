What was the last movie you saw?
300!
I love that movie.  One of my favorites.
I know, Gerard Butler was a total monster in that movie.
Plus the battle scenes were the best you've ever seen.
Yes!  It was crazy the slow then fast fighting.
And all the Spartans were super ripped.  Like beast of nature.
They way they just smacked around the Pursians for so long.
Yeah, King Xerxies though was pretty cool.  He was so tall.
He manipulated that Hunchback pretty well too.
Yeah I know.  I don't know if I could have resisted either.
He knew what he was doing to have an empire that big.
How about the ending?
yeah, all the Spartans died.  Except that one guy with the eye of course.
And it was cool how at the end they talk about how many more Spartans there were.
You know what else was great?  When the queen killed that guy.
Yes, using his own words against him.
That guy was a total tool.  I hated him.
I know, it's always great when a bad guy gets a fitting death.
And when it's done by someone who owes him.
