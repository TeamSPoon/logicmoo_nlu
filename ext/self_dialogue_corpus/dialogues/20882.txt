I had no idea that Split was connected to Unbreakable.
Me either. I was so confused when Bruce Willis showed up at the end.
I was so confused when Kevin actually turned into The Beast.
I know. I was not expecting the movie to be a supervillian movie at all.
I thought it was just going to be a typical scary movie.
Totally, but it did make me want to watch Unbreakable after I saw it.
Me too, and did you hear a sequel is coming out called Glass?
Really? I had no idea.
Oh yeah. It's coming out in 2019.
That's exciting. It has been a while since I have seen Bruce Willis in a movie.
Me too. I loved him in The Sixth Sense.
M. Night Shymalan directed The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable, and Split.
Wow. That must be why I love all of those movies so much.
Yep. Did you ever see Signs?
No, I've never heard of it.
He directed that movie, too.
Oh, is it any good?
It's not as highly rated as some of his other films, but I found it very enjoyable.
Cool. What is it about?
It's about a man that has lost his faith after his wife dies, and he has to comes to terms with what he believes when aliens try to takeover earth.
