Can't wait for the football season to get here. Summer will not be over soon enough.
I agree. Baseball is fun for a while but the season just drags on.
Yeah. In football, the season is much shorter and much more exciting
So who do you think will be the best team this year.?
Da bears!  I heard mike ditka is coming out of retirement to bring the bears back to the promised land.
Hah ha. Aren't you a comedian. The bears will have to beat he packers first. And we both know that will not happen.
Not necessarily. Aaron Rodgers is getting older. And Mitch trubisky is the real deal.
Are you delirious?  Trubisky was maybe the third best quarterback in the acc last year. And how you think he can win in the NFL?
Certainly. He went to UNC. They develop smart players.
Oh?  You are not smart if you get As in fake classes.
Whatever. You know that you are scared of the bears this year.  Probably worried about the Vikings and the lions too.
You have lost your mind. The packers will dominate the NFC north
They might win a few games at lambeau because the rest of the league is not used to playing in ice.
We will win 7 of 8 at lambeau and win 5 more on the road for a 12 win season. Then it is on to the playoffs.
I will bet you that the packers will not make the playoffs this year. If they do, I will wear a Rodgers jersey for a day.
Ok what size do you wear?  I will be ordering the jersey later today
I wear an extra small. Same as the chance that mike McCarthy survives the season as the coach.
Doesn't matter who the coach is.  Go pack go!
The pack is wack. I hope they get stuck in godforsaken Green Bay.
Not listening to that nonsense. Holler at me when the bears score a touchdown this year.
