What's your thoughts on the Beatles song let it be?
One of my favorites. Like the story behind it.
Imagine having a dream about your mother and waking up and writing a hit song about the dream.
That's a talent for sure.
I know ther was a lot of dissension making the album let it be,but I still think it's one of their best.
I agree. Yoke was a big problem in the studio.
She was always there which was unusual for the Beatles. No outsiders were ever in the studio before .
She was a constant that rubbed the other Beatles the wrong way.
Especially paul!
Hahahahah that's for sure.
