Hey what kind of music do you like?
I really like ska music, what about you?
Death metal is usually what I listen to.
Say, why do you like such loud music?
Well ska is loud sometimes, too, and it sometimes comes down to personal preference.
I guess you're right.
So do you ever listen to other genres?
Yeah I'll sometimes listen to country or rock, you?
I surprisingly like jazz sometimes.
Oh yea, I forgot, Jazz is great!
Yeah. Have you ever been to a concert?
Yeah I went to see Streetlight Manifesto back in January. Do you ever buy merch at concerts?
I've bought a t shirt and cd's.
Wow, who still listens to cd's now adays?
Hey, I still use my casette player.
Wow. Are they from 1980?
Yes, they are. I am an old man.
I guess death metal has been around longer than ska right?
Indeed. Goodbye
Goodbye
