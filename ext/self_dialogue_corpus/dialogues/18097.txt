Do you like Gwen Stefani's music?
I mean, I guess I do. I can't say that I seek it out, but I like what I hear on the radio.
I like her. I think she has unique style.
I like that song Used to Love You that she put out a year or two ago.
That was a good one. And it was a real window into her life I think.
Right, that was after her divorce from her cheating husband right?
It sure was. But she is with Blake Shelton, a country singer now.
I like Blake Shelton. I know his music.
I really like some of his newer stuff, but I do not know much of his older stuff.
I really like an older song that he has called Austin.
Hey, I know that song. I didn't know that was him.
What newer songs of his do you like?
I like Honey Bee. It is pretty catchy.
I think that he and Gwen Stefani should do a duet.
I thought they already did, didn't they?
Oh yeah, that is right.
I think it is called Go Ahead and Break My Heart.
That's right. It is kind of a funny mix of genres.
It is, but I really like how the song turned out.
I really like it too, now that I remember it.
