What did you think of Star Wars: Rogue One?
I really liked it, and how it ties in to the series.
I do too, especially how it ends right where Episode 4 starts.
Yeah, the ending with Darth Vader wrecking those resistance fighters was great.
Did you like that ending the best out of all of the Star Wars movies?
I think so, except for the ending of Empire Strikes back.
I like that one too, but Rogue One was so good!
K2SO was my favorite droid out of all of them.
I know, his literal, sarcastic tone is hilarious.
I love Alan Tudyk, the man who does K2SO's voice.
