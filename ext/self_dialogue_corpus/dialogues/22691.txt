Did you know they came out with a new Cars movie?
I don't think I did know that. Is it as good as the old ones?
I'm not sure, haven't seen it yet.
I was thinking of taking my kids.
Me too.
My older son was a huge fan of the older Cars movies. Especially Cars 2.
I loved Cars 2. Mator was hilarious.
Yes! Especially when he ate all that wasabi.
He thought it was pistachio ice cream.
Did you know that blonde actor I forget his name did Lightning McQueen's name?
You mean Owen Wilson?
Yes him! I knew his face but not his name.
He did pretty well.
Do you know who did Mator's voice?
Actually no I don't.
It was Larry the Cable guy.
Oh okay now I can see that. Makes sense.
I liked the pretty car who was "Mator's girlfriend."
She was a nice character. I like how she claimed him at the end as his girlfriend.
It was super cute.
