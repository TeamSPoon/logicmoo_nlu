Did you see both Wonder Woman and Superman?
Yes, and I saw all Superman movies.
Which did you like better?
Wonder Woman by far.
Me too, but did you hear about the wage gap?
Nope, what happened?
Henry Cavill made $14 million for his first stint as superman but Gal Gadot made just $300,000 per each of her three Wonder Woman movies.
That's crazy, but I understand.
How??
Well, Superman is well-established in the superhero movie business and was easily going to make $500 million, whereas Wonder Woman is not and is a gamble. He is also well-established as an actor, while she's a famous model.  So, it makes sense.
