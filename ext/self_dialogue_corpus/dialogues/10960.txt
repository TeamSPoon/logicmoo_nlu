What are the Pens chances against the Senators?
I think they dominate
But this is the Eastern Conference Finals
The Pens already beat the two best teams in the east
But what about the trap?
The Pens are too fast to be affected by that
Weren't the Rangers fast though too?
Yes, but not nearly as talented
They still lost though
Yes, but it took two miracle last second wins
So how many games?
Pens in 5
Isn't that a bit early?
No, the Pens take two at home, split on the road, and finish up at home.
Who wins in the West?
Predators in 6
Why is that?
The Ducks are weak
So Pens and Preds in the finals
Definitely
