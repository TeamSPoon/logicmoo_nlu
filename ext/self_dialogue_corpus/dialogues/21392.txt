Have you been to the movies lately?
Yes, I went last weekend.
What did you see?
I saw the re-air of Rear Window.
Wow! I didn't know that was even possible.
Yeah, Turner Classic Movies has these showings of classic movies at theaters around the country.
I wish I would have known!
I'll let you know the next time they do something like this.
That would be great. I love classic movies.
Me too. And getting to see them in the theater again is the best.
Much better than just on your tv, I would imagine.
Oh, definitely! And they have restored the films as well.
So they look good up on the big screen?
Really good. Cleaned up, no hissing or soft edges. Really sharp and nice.
Have you seen other films like this?
You mean in the theater?
Yeah, in the theater, re-airings.
No, not other classic movies. That's why I really wanted to go this screening.
Well, don't forget to let me know the next time!
Don't worry, I won't!
