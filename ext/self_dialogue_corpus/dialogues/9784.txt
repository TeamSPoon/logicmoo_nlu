What's your favorite Run-DMC song?
I like My Adidas.
That's a good one. Do you like Run's House?
I love that song. I also like Krush Groove.
Which one is that?
They made a movie back in the eighties called Krush Groove. It was the song they did at the end.
You mean the one with Sheila E, The Fat Boys, and Kurtis Blow?
Yeah that's the one. The verse Run-DMC did on there was sick.
I wonder what ever happened to The Fat Boys?
I think one of them died.
