Do you like the specail effects in the Star Wars movies?
Yes, I watch the movies to see the specail effects.
Do you perfer the old movies or the new movies?
I like both sets of movies.
I think that the newest Star Wars movies have the best specail effects.
I agree, but the old set still looks real good.
Thats true, the older movies have a kind of appeal to them.
The old set have a kind of nostalgic value.
Definitly. but I still perfer the newer movies.
I have no perference between the sets.
