Yes, it's not a bad movie.

Sean Penn, Elizabeth Hurley.
Nice.  Any sex scenes?
Hurley does a nude scene, but no sex.
Anything else?

Too bad.  What is it about?
A writer and his wife go on his brother's boat for a vacation.  The writer flirts with the brother's girlfriend.
Cool.  Anything else?
There's a whole other plot based on a murder in the past.
Sort of like Possession?
Yes, pretty much like that, with flashbacks to the past.
Who was in the past?
A very cool young actress named Sarah Polley playing a murderess.
Sounds neat.  I might see it.
