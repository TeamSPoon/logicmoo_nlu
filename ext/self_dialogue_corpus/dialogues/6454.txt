Did you see the Cars 3 trailer? The graphics changed a lot.
Well, the other trailers didn't have the same quailty, but still better than the first two.
It must have been to for the dramatic scene then.
Yeah, some scenes are given extra details in animation.
When I see a drastic shift in art quailty, I get taken out of the movie.
Lightning McQueen crashing like that and changing from plastic to a gritty art style will make people notice.
I know they do that to get people feel a certain way but still.
It's just a trailer. Maybe the whole movie will still look like plastic.
Yeah, the trailer is sometimes different than the movie.
I can't wait to see how it turns out.
