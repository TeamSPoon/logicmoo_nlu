Hey, are you ready for some football?
Yes. Can't wait for the first game.
You. I can't wait to see Green Bay run the season.
Green Bay, get out of here. They are not going to the superbowl this year.
Why do you say that? They have one of the best quarterbacks in the league.
Who you talking about, Aaron Rodgers?
You know it. He has a ranking with touchdown to interception ratio of 4.12.
But what does that really mean?
That means for me, that Rodgers is number 1 quarterback in the NFL, and he can take his team to the superbowl.
I think you are forgetting the team has to do their part too.
No. Ha Ha, it just sounds like I'm getting ahead of myself. Looking forward to a good season.
Well, I'm going to stick with my boys from Houston Texas.
Your a Houston Texan fan?
You know it. They may have never made it to the Superbowl, but there is always potential.
Who is their quarterback?
I believe this year they are using Deshaun Watson from Cleveland.
Did they ever make it to the playoffs?
I know they did 3 or 4 times, but there could be more.
Well, I'll make sure to keep an eye out for these Texans you talk up so much.
Alright, and I hope your team has a good season. Peace.
