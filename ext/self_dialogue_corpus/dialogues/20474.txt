What is your favorite money-related film?
Interesting question. I would have to say The Wolf of Wall Street.
I enjoyed that movie. It could have been an hour shorter though.
Agreed, but between Martin Scorsese's direction and Leonardo DiCaprio's acting, the film was close to a masterpiece.
I wouldn't go that far. Also, I much preferred Oliver Stone's Wall Street.
While a good film, I found it too overt in its criticism of the financial sector.
It was a bit overt, but I think it was attempting to portray the growth of the financial sector that was occurring at the time it was made.
Did you ever the sequel made after the 2008 financial crisis?
Yeah, it was terrible. I would contend that the sequel is one of Oliver Stone's worst films ever.
Not JFK or Nixon?
I am kind of interested in conspiracy theories, so I really liked those films.
Fair enough, my favorite Oliver Stone film would probably have to be Platoon.
That was a great film, but I always preferred Full Metal Jacket to Platoon.
Platoon is also really good. My favorite part was the drill sergeant played by R. Lee Ermey.
He is such an underrated actor. I really liked when he played the police captain in Seven.
Also an amazing film. Such a great performance by Kevin Spacey in that film.
Agreed. There was like a five-year period in the 1990s where Kevin Spacey just made great movies.
Yeah. The Usual Suspects is my favorite crime movie of all time.
Probably the high point of Stephen Baldwin's acting career.
Yeah. I still can't believe that he followed up such a great film with Bio-Dome.
