My brother's favorite character is Lando.
Really?  He's not very memorable in my opinion.
Lando is cool though.  Fast talking guy, can get out of a situation easily.
There's already someone like that called Han Solo.
Yeah, but where do you think Han learned it from?
Lando also stabbed them in the back and basically got Han frozen.
He didn't mean to, he didn't have a choice.
He did have a choice and he screwed it up.
He helped get him free eventually though, don't forget about that.
Yeah, but who wants to be frozen in carbonite?  Lando has lots of blame for that.
