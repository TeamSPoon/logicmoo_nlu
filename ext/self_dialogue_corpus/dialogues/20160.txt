Are you excited for all these new DC movies?
I mean, in a way I am.
Why would you not be?
I prefer the Marvel Universe movies.
I like DC better.
Why do you like those movies over Marvel?
I think they tend to be a bit more gritty than the Marvel movies.
How do?
Well, Batman for one.
Batman has to be dark, he is the Dark Knight.
Well, even the Superman movies are a bit more dark than say, Xmen.
Day of Future Past was actually really dark.
You think more than Batman?
I think the whole Xmen franchise was dark and gritty.
Come on, Xmen the Last Stand was a joke.
That movie gets a bad rap
The way they just let Summers die, off screen bothered me.
Well, that was part of the plot, to build into the new one.
The newest one just erased all the old one.
That was part of the plot!
