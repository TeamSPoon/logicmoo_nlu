Is there a certain horror movie you always watch in October?
Indeed, I always make sure to see Halloween.
Is that the movie with Jamie Lee Curtis in it?
Yes, it was her first horror movie.
I remember now.  She was dubbed The Scream Queen.
Did you know that she used her own clothes in the film?
That is neat.  The soundtrack really made the movie scary.
The music was creepy as well as the mask.
The mask is actually William Shatner's face painted white.
It is amazing how creative John Carpenter is.
