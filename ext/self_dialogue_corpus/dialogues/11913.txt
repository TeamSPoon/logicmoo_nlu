Are you a Beatles Fan.
You bet your ass I am, they were amazing.
I know, I have watched their first appearance on the Ed Sullivan Show over and over again on YouTube.
I have watched a lot of their old concerts live on YouTube.
The Sargent Pepper album changed music as we know it.
I love Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds.  It is one of my favorite songs of all time.
I love that one also. I also love when i'm 64.
I feel like that is always one of their most underrated songs.
Don't forget Lovely RIta
There are just so many on that Album that were amazing songs.
