My kids keep asking to watch Disney movies.
I love Disney movies! What are you watching now?
Now it's Moana.
Oh, I loved that! I loved the strong female lead.
Yeah, it isn't too bad. It makes me want to go on vacation somewhere tropical.
The ending is really fun. And those songs will be stuck in your head.
This chicken is cracking me up, I have to admit!
Yeah, there are some really funny parts. You will like it by the end, I promise!
Well, like all Disney movies, I'm sure I will have learned a lesson.
You are right! There's always a good moral!
