Are you a fan of the lord of the rings?
I thought it was ok, not my favorite series
Why not?
I just thought the movies were too long
Yea, 3 hours is a long time
Peter Jackson is a good director though!
Yea, I liked how they filmed it in New Zealand
That was a good aspect of the movie.
He also made the remake to king kong
I really loved that movie
A big gorilla destroying stuff is also fun to watch
Planet of the apes is something you gotta see then!
I have not seen it!!
Its about apes who are are just as smart as humans and they talk
Really? Wow
Yea, and humans and the apes go to war!
It sounds amazing, who is in it?
There are a lot of movies, but Matt Reeves directed the new one
I love science fiction movies like that
Its a nice blend of action and philosophy
