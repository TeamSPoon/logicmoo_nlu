Do you think Drew Bres is going to catch Peyton Manning's touchdown reccord?
What is he, like 74 away.
Yeah he would have to throw 37 in the next two years to get it.
He's 38 years old though, and he's going to turn 39 during the season. I don't know if he'll do it.
Plus his team isn't as good as its been in the past. It might take him three seasons.
Tom Brady isn't that far beind Bres either, maybe he will break the reccord.
Tom Brady is a year and a half older though, he would have to play until hes 42 to get it.
He doesn't seem to be slowing down any time soon.
Anyone else close to the reccord?
Eli Manning is the next closest whos playing, but hes pretty far behind. I don't think he has a chance.
What about Aaron Rodgers?
He is about three hundred behind. I think missing those years sitting behind Favre is going to cost him a chance.
It really improved his game though.
I know, he has the best QB rating of all time.
Rivers is right up there with Eli Manning, but he probably won't get it either.
It's crazy how many people on the TD leaderboard are still playing or just retired in the last 10 years.
Teams throw a lot more now though, some teams barely run the ball unless they have to.
Dan Marino played back before all of this and he's pretty high on the list.
So did Fran Tarkenton, he had a lot of TD passes.
Imagine if those guys played today how many they would have.
