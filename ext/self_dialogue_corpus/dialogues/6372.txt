I just got finished watching Moana with my daughter for the 100th time!
Wow, that's a lot! She must love that movie!
She really does. Especially the songs, when they come on she sings and dances. It's adorable!
Aww! I've heard a bit about the movie, but I've never seen it. It's the one with The Rock in it right?
Yes, he plays a demi-god named Maui. He's actually pretty funny!
I've been meaning to watch it. What's it about?
Moana is the main character, she travels across the sea with Maui to save her island from "the darkness".
Where does it take place?
I thought it was Hawaii because of Maui, but I read somewhere it's actually inspired by the Polynesian islands like Bora Bora and Samoa.
Sounds awesome. I'll have to check it out soon!
