Do you know the band Manchester Orchestra?
I think so! They are from the East Coast, right?
Correct. They are from Atlanta.
I thought that was the case. I heard of them years ago.
My favorite song from them is called "Shake It Out"
Interesting. I am more partial to the song "I Can Feel A Hot One"
What year was that song released?
It came out in 2009
Who is the main songwriter of the band?
I believe that his name is Andy Hull.
That sounds familiar. I remember reading his name on the liner notes of the band's CD.
There are more members in the band than just him though.
Who else is in the band?
The drummer is named Tim Very.
Good to know. Who plays guitar?
Robert McDowell is the name of the lead guitarist.
And Andy Hull also plays rhythm guitar, right?
Correct. He plays and he sings.
Wow, I am always impressed when people can do that.
Me too! I wish I had that skill set.
