Hi there.
Hello.
Do you like music?
Yeah of course I do.
What kinds of music are you interested in?
Oh just a whole bunch.
Are there any genres in particular that you gravitate towards?
I really enjoy hip hop.
Oh that's cool.
Yeah hip hop from the 80's and 90's.
Don't like the newer rap?
No it all sort of sounds the same.  Like everyone is trying to imitate one another.
Yeah I can see that.  Didn't that sort of happen in the 80's and 90's as well?
To small extent, but most were trying to be different and groundbreaking.
Do you have any favorite acts?
I really like Rakim.
Is he a rapper?
MC yeah.
Cool.
Yep.
