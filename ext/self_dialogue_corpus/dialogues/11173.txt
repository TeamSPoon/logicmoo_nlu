Who do you think was the worst dressed at this year's Met Gala
Caroline Kennedy, hands down
Why do you say Caroline was the worst dressed.
Although she stuck to the theme, the dress was simply unflattering on her.
A agree. What made it unflattering to you?
It just seemed way to large for her body frame.
Yes, I agree. It really overpowered her.
Right. I hated her shoes as well
They were like little black pilgrim shoes
Yes. Reminded me of the same shoes the Wicked Witch of the West wore in The Wizard of Oz
Yes. They were not very complementary to her dress.
Her hair was not complementary to the dress either.
I agree. Neither was her makeup. Very plain.
It didn't seem like her hair and makeup were done at all.
Right. She just put on the dress and figured that was enough, I guess.
I would have liked to see her in something with less volume.
I agree. One of the more slenderizing designs of Rei Kawakubo would have been nice.
Yes. Caroline is tall and slim. I think a drop waist design would have worked better
And better shoes
Yes. A nice pair of stilettos would have looked nice instead of pilgrim heels.
