I want to go to Neverland.
Neverland? As in Peter Pan's home?
Of course! I want to be Wendy.
Now that you mention it, I do too.
Except I'd never leave. Who would leave that place?
Yeah, there's no reason to grow up. It's awful.
Peter had it right. Peter and Tinkerbell.
Tinkerbell is my favorite.
Wendy is such a wet blanket. Peter is better off without her.
Poor Wendy! She's not that bad.
