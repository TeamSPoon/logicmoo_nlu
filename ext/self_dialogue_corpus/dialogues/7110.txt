I can't remember-- which Disney movie did "When You Wish Upon A Star" come from?
That's from Pinocchio.
Thanks, I remember now! Jiminy Cricket was so cute.
Yeah, and Pinocchio sure needed Jiminy Cricket to be his conscience.
That movie had a good message for kids about lying and disobeying.
I agree, and it was presented with the usual Disney magic.
True, it taught kids a lesson without being too preachy.
Looking at the state of the world today, some people really needed to see Pinocchio when they were kids.
It's too bad real people's noses don't grow every time they lie.
Yeah. It would make my life easier if they did!
