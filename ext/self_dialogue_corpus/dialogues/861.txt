Are you ready for this years NFL season?
Yes, I am are you.
Ohh yea, I cant wait.
Im really looking forward to see how the raiders do.
The move to vegas should be good for the fan and the team.
I bet it will breathe some new life to the franchise.
I sure hope so.
The raiders have been mediocre for awhile.
Im also very excited about Marshawn Lynch
Me too, should be good.
Do you think the falcons can get back to the bowl.
I do, they will be tough to beat this year.
New England got pretty lucky last year.
Yes, they did.
I hope the rams can pull out of the slump,
yea, they had a lot riding on them last year.
Its time to let the rookie QB shine.
Thats why they drafted him.
Goodluck this season.
You too as well.
