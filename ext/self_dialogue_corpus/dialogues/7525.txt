I just finished Harry Potter and the goblet of Fire!
Really? What did you think of it?
Well, first of all, I didn't even know that either of the two schools existed. Durmstrang and Beauxbatons are really interesitng to watch, when competing with Hogwarts.
I know! It really was cool to find out that viktor Krum was in Durmstrang. And a Triwizard champion at that!
One of my favorite parts wsa when Harry saved not just one, but two people from the lake.
Yeah, that was rather heroic!
Cedric performed so well, didn't he?
Oh yes, he was a favorite champion, that's for sure. So many people wanted him to win.
What about the tournament itself? Did you want anyone in particular to win?
I really wanted Cedric or Harry wo win, Hogwarts all the way!
