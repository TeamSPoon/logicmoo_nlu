What are you listening to on your MP3 player?
Enya. Her music is awesome.
Really? Why do you like specifically Enya?
There's just something about her choice in songs, and the combination of lyrics and her silky voice.
I've heard that she is the same person who did the vocals for some major movies.
Yes! She did May It Be, which is a song from the Lord of the Rings movies.
I can imagine her voice in those movies.
But her music in general is very relaxing and will always be a part of my relax favorites playlist.
I need to add her to mine! When did she start her music career?
She first started writing songs for the Celts, which is a BBC show that came out in 1986.
Oh, so she has been a songwriter for over thirty years, now.
Yes.
So does she fall under Celtic music or New Age?
Both. I think her albums offer a lot to people who want to experience Ireland, as well as  something relaxing.
Is she pretty popular among people of different cultures?
Yes, she has actually sold 75 million copies of her album worldwide.
Speaking of New Age, I think Yanni also falls under that category.
Yeah, I like his stuff sometimes, too. He is Greek.
He got his start is the eighties, right?
Yeah, he was older than Enya, born in 1954.
