What a crazy off-season its been in the AFC East!
I know! As usual the patriots got stronger and the Jets didn't.
The patriots did have some great signings and trades, but you can't deny that Tom Brady is getting old.
Sure, he's over 40 but he had one of his best season's last year.
But no quarterback has ever done this well at his age, he's due for regression.
I still disagree - he's got the best coach in the game that knows how to call plays to ensure he's not getting hit.
I was impressed with them getting Brandin Cooks - great trade!
He's going to be amazing with Brady - finally the weapon that Brady needs.
I think Dwayne allen will do well in this offense too
Yeah, that seems like a underappreciated trade.
What about the Jets - do you think they'll improve on last year?
No way! They are a mess - and they don't have a starting caliber quarterback.
You don't think Petty or Heckenberg can have a decent season? I think the defense will be strong.
No - neither of them is an NFL starting quarterback. They drafted well though - they're going to have two great safeties in Adams and Maye.
Yeah - they're going to be great in a few years, the issue is the jets got weaker at Cornerback
Agreed - they should have signed someone reliable other than Claiborne - he's good but injured too often.
But if Claiborne has a good season - the secondary will be a strength of the team.
Don't forget the defensive line - thats the real strength.
Thats true - but Mo Wilkerson needs to have a bounce back season.
I'm sure he will - and Leonard Williams is a beast who will only get better!
