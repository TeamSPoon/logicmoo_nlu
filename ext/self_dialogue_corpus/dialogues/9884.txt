Are you listening to much rap these days?
Sometimes, though I usually play old school stuff from the 90s. I'm not that familiar with newer rappers.
90s rap is good, though there's some great stuff being released right now. You should check it out.
I wouldn't know where to start.
Try Kendrick Lamar. He's good.
Cool, who else?
Run the Jewels are excellent. Try their song "Oh My Darling, Don't Cry".
That doesn't sound like a rap song.
Trust me, it's a rap song, and it's very good.
Okay, I'll check it out!
