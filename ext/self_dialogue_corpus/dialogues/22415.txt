Have you seen the Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 2?
Not yet, I knew it came out the other week, so I have just been working too much as usual!
I was wondering if you would like to go to the movies tonight with me?
To see the Guardians?  Sure, that sounds fun.
Chris Pratt and Vin Diesel is in it.
Yes, it looks even more exciting than the first one was.
I want to see Groot  ;)
Yes, he looks so cute as a small guy.
I know!  I am a big fan of him.
The other movie I want to see is Rogue One.
Rogue One, the new star wars movie from last year?
Yes, I think they are playing it again over at the theater as a special showing.
Any of those sci fi movies always look best on the big screens.
Yes, I agree about that.  I saw Avatar on the big screen, and totally fell in love with that movie.
Avatar was phenomenal. it got so many awards.
Yeah, it is one of my favorites.
What time do you want to go to the Guardians?
How about 7pm?
Sounds good to me.
See you then!
