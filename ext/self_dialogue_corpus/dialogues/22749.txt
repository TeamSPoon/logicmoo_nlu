Have you seen Wonder Woman yet?
No, I think I'm the only person who hasn't seen it yet!
What? Why haven't you seen it?
Just haven't gotten around to it yet. Did you think it was actually good?
I totally did. You know I don't even really like superhero movies, but this was awesome.
In what way?
Well, both the leads (Gal Gadot and Chris Pine) were really engaging, and had great chemistry together.
Okay. They're both pretty attractive as stars.
But what was really fun for me was the way the female director shot this movie.
Did it actually make a difference, you think?
For me it did. I liked how the camera didn't really seem to objectify Diana's character in the way most movies do.
Hmm, interesting. I didn't really think about how having a woman director might influence things.
Plus, the fight scene across no-mans-land is AMAZING!
No-man's land?
Yeah, this particular story is kind of a creation story, and it's set during World War I.
Whoa, I didn't know that. So, fighting Nazis?
World War I. Still Germans, but not Nazis.
Oh, right. The previews I've seen look a little steampunk.
Yeah, the London scenes definitely are. At any rate, you should definitely see it. It was amazing. I want to see it again.
Okay, you've convinced me.
