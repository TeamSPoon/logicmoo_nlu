I liked the villain in Man of Steel.
He was great.
I think he was called Zod.
Yes, he was a general on Crypton.
The fight at the end was amazing.
Oh yeah. Super man had to fight him.
It was amazing seeing that destruction.
They really destroyed everything.
Superman even killed him.
He had no choice.
