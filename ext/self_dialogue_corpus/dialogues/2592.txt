Think the Patriots will again this year?
Yes. This year and the next. Then the wheel start to fall off
What do you mean?
Brady will be 42 in two years...I think. Father time will catch up with him
Suprised that it hasn't already?
In a way. I think he made a deal with the devil.
Hahahahaha, that, crazy man
Then explain to me how he is able to produce this long...
I can't. Been wondering a bit about that myself.
For some strange reason he's been able to do this for this long, missing only one year.
Nothing changes with that team, and I hate it so much
Don't know how they do it.
I'm not really worried about them doing it. I mad beause my team ain't doing it
Hahahahaha true. It burns me too.
Nothing we can do about it either.
I am not ready to give up yet.
That's cool...just don't hold your breath
Never had...lol
Wait a minute, who is your team?
Cincinnati
