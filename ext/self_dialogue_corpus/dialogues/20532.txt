Have you seen any good movies lately?
Yeah, my husband and I just rented Get Out.
How was that?
It was different...not what we expected, but good.
I just saw A Cure for Wellness.
I wanted to see that.  How was it?
It was awesome!  Kept me guessing til the very end!
Do you like suspenseful movies?
Love them!  One of my favorites is Fear.
That has Mark Wahlberg right?
Yes it does.  Usually I only like him in funny movies, but he was excellent in Fear.
I loved him in Ted.
That is a great one!  How did you like him in Daddy's Home?
Thought he did great.  I think he and Will Ferrell work great together!
Will Ferrell is a great actor.  I liked him in Step Brothers.
That's one of my favorites.
How did you like him in Talladega Nights?
I didn't care for that movie as much.
It wasn't my favorite either.  I think my favorite Will Ferrell movie was Elf!
That's an excellent movie!
