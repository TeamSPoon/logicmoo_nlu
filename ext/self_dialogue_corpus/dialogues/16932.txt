I've been listening to a lot of Bruce Springsteen lately.
I love Springsteen, very classic sound.
I do too, I like to listen to Born to Run.
Thats a great song.
I saw him once at Fenway, it was the first concert that was ever there.
That must have been so cool to see a concert in a baseball stadium.
It really was and it's so close to my house.
How cool you got to see a concert and walk home in just a few minutes.
I loved it, what a unique experience.
Can you hear the other shows even if you don't go to them.
Oh yes, a bunch of us sit outside with our dogs and listen.
Thats awesome you can hear all the shows.
When Paul McCartney played we could hear everything.
Next time I want to come over and listen.
In a few weeks I'm going to New Edition.
Wow, they must be so old.
They are it will remind me of my childhood.
I used to listen to them all the time.
Me too, and they are playing with Paula Abdul
What a great show.
