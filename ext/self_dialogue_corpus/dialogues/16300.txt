What is your favorite kind of music to listen to?
I like Kanye West a lot.
Seriously?
Yes. I don't know why people do not like his music.
He went downhill once he got involved with a reality star.
I slightly agree in terms of his ego but his music is still good.
He uses way too much auto-tune.
But that is what makes it good though!
I used to like his Graduation album.
That is probably his best one.
What songs do you like from his new stuff?
Real Friends.
Oh that song is okay.
I also like No More Parties in LA.
I have not heard that one yet.
Take a listen sometime soon.
Well I enjoyed talking to you!
Same to you!
We should do it again sometime!
Agreed!
