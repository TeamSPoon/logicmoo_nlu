Hey, do you like Mel Brooks movies?
Yes, I have seen all of his movies and think they are hilarious.  Blazing saddles has to be my all time favorite.
Yeah, that was a good one.  Really enjoyed their parody of the wild west.
Yeah, who was your favorite character in that movie?
Probably the waco kid.
Gene wilder did a really good job with that character.  the back story about him getting shot by a kid was funny.
It was.  Him and cleavon little had really good chemistry together.
Yeah, the whole cast seemed to work really well together.
Did you like the ending?
That was the only part that felt a little out of place.  i thought they could have done better on that.
