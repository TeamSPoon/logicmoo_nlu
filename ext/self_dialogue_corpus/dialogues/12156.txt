So, how would you have changed The Force Awakens?
Well, I would have added more of TR-8R.  Heck, maybe even made him a secondary protagonist.
What.. who's TR-8R?
Not surprised you don't know him, they never gave his name.  He's that Stormtrooper Finn confronts, who calls him a traitor, drops his blaster and shield and pulls out a baton type weapon.
Oh, yeah, I remember that scene!  That was pretty cool!
I agree, but it was waaaay too short.  The should have built that guy up a little more, maybe have something interrupt the battle and them have them fight to the death later or something.
Did he get shot or something like ten seconds within the fight?
Not sure it was even that long, but yeah.
Man, it's a bit like Darth Maul, cool villain, but little development.
Yeah, and they both died in a pretty lame fashion as well.
