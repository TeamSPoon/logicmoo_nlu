Who do you think is the best Quarterback of all time?
My favorite is John Elway, but best of all time is probably Tom Brady.
So you like Tom Brady?
No, I hate him with a passion.
But you say he is the best of time.
That statement is based on his merit not how I feel about him.
Why dont you like Brady?
Because I am a Bronco fan. Denver and New England have a lot of play off history.
The patriots also have the best coach of all times.
Yes that would be hard to debate against him.
He was way better than any Bronco coach.
Well the Patriots defensive coach was a Denver head coach and destroyed the team, so.....
Denver was just a horrible team.
We had some of the best prospects that he fired.
Brandon Marshall and Jay Cutler?
Yes, those two.
They were no good.
They are better than you could have ever been.
But im not a professional athlete.
Exactly, why are talking like this?
