Have you seen the new Cars movie?
They made a new one?
Yes! Of course they did.
How many is that now?
It is Cars three.
I was not even aware they made a second, why so many.
It is a really successful film series.
I do not see how.
What? Mater was so funny.
They are just cars, there is no story line.
