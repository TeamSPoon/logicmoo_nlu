That's not as sad as flipping burgers at a local fast food joint for the rest of your life.
Nope. And it's actually a pretty good job. You might even be able to get Phys ed teacher certification and get paid twice. For the teaching and then for the coaching job.
I wonder how much that is.
Some make a lot more as a full fledged coach. Others get a teaching salary and a stipend as a coach. it all varies.
I wonder who the highest paid high school basketball coach is.
I know people who get paid more than 100K a year for coaching high school b-ball.
Who?
A guy named Kevin Boyle. Used to coach at St. Patrick High school. Got headhunted by a school in Florida.
Nice sunny weather vs Joisy. Hard to pass that up.
Yep, Yep. He's now making over 130K a year.
Yeah, but how many of these D-leaguers will make it as a high school coach to that extent?
Not many for sure.
Well. Maybe we should commercialize amateur sports in the US.
Um. no.
Why not?
Because Amateurs do it for the love of the game. They have to learn the love of the game first before they can love the money.
Everyone loves the money.
That's why we can't let commercialization of the amateur games at college/high school levels.
Colleges make so much money if you have a good football team, or even nationally ranked basketball teams.
But most of these amateur programs are money losers. Commercializing them won't help much.
