Who are your top five favorite rappers of all time?
Probably Nas, Jay Electronica, Phonte, Max B, and MF Doom.
That's a really interesting list.
Who are your top five?
Biggie, Nas, Big Pun, Del, and Kendrick.
You're saying Kendrick is an all-timer already?
Well, he's actually been around longer now than Biggie was.
Yeah, that's a good point. Biggie died very young.
I think Kendrick has given us three classic albums already.
It's hard enough to put out one.
Jay Electronica hasn't put out any.
I know, but the few songs we've heard from him are on another level.
It's odd that he's had such a small amount of output.
I used to be really frustrated by it, but I've gotten over it.
Yeah, there's nothing we can do about it.
Do you think he'll ever put out an album?
I have no idea.
Del was another interesting choice on your list.
I like him because he's so unique. Nobody else sounds anything like him.
Yeah, that's very true. He's instantly recognizable, and he has bars.
