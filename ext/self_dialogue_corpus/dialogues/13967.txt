I was reading about Lady Gaga and she had a band named," Stefani Germanotta Band with some friends from NYU.
That is a crazy name for a band.
The band started out playing gigs in New York on the lower east side.
I think it would be fun being in a band. I do not have any musical talent.
I don't either but I love to sing along as long as I am by myself.
Is she from Austria or Europe?
No, she is an American.
Really, I did not know that.
I'll bet you didn't know she went to a Catholic school but she says the New York underground is where she found herself.
Well, I am glad she did because she has some really great songs.
