Was Patrick Stuart in one of the superhero movies?
Duh, he was in X-Men. He's Professor X.
Aw snap! I thought I saw him but I've been out of the loop. Is he any good?
Yeah, he's perfect for that role. It's like the comics came to life.
Good casting makes a big difference.
No doubt, it sucks when they have a great part and make bad choices.
Like when Ben Affleck played Daredevil...should have been dare douchebag!
Haha, that's funny.
That was a true skunker.
Yeah, it's got to be the ALL time worst!
