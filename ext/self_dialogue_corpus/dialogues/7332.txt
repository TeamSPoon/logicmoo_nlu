Didn't you used to love Cinderella?
Yes, I still do. She is my favorite Disney princess.
Her dress is the prettiest, I think.
Even though the pink dress was pretty, the one the Fairy Godmother made ended up being beautiful.
It was so sad when the step sisters destroyed the pink dress, though.
I know, the mice and birds had worked so hard to make it special for Cinderella.
I think that Jaq and Gus were my favorite characters. They were so cute.
And they loved Cinderella very much. They really tried to look out for her!
Yeah, even though her step-family was so mean to her, she did have good friends in the animals.
And she was lucky to have such a good fairy godmother!
