I feel like the Eagles are going to be the next big thing in the NFL
I feel the opposite
Whys that?
They dont have a young anything
Their quarterback?
Even hes older for a 2nd year player.
Well they can last longer if theyre smart.
I think thats part of it, but yeah they arent young anywhere
The thirst their receivers are going to have is going to be crazy
I admit the 1 year deal was a good thing no matter what you say
It could cost them but if hes hurt then they are geniuses.
I think they made good moves this offseason to improve the team
The defense will always be a question mark
Yeah I just dont know why that team has not fielded a good team in years
Every since Jim Johnson passed they havent
And their scheme is not all that complicated
I think its a bit vanilla.
Maybe so, but who knows
Cox needs a huge year
So does Jenkins or hes going to get cut
