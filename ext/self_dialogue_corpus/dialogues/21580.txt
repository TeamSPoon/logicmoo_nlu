so how are you entertaining me when i visit yours.
hahaha my mom made some pancakes and got frozen pizza and couple of drinks, so don't worry mate,you in safe hands hahaha.
don't you think it calls for a great movie, to watch while we dine lol
oyeah i had already thought about that i rented couple of 2017 blue ray movies.
that's what am talking about, so how many movies you got?
rented just 3.
which are?
''Baby Boss" "Fist Fight" and "47 meters Down".
wow no way , you got "47 meters Down"?
yeah sure though I've not seen it yet, rented as i found the story line on the pack quite interesting so i gave it a go.
my colleague at work was talking about it just couple of days back.
oh really.
is a story about a guy who found a girl in a mysterious place but never knew she was a ma maid.
oh no stop don't tell me the full story, i want to enjoy the movie, we should probably see that then.
hahaha alright. sure that would be of, if there's still time we could watch "Fist Fight" saw it half way at Ann's parent's.
oh i see, i guessed right then, i knew you'll love Ghetto films and with Ice Cube on it is easy to tell it would be nice.
of course,it is, so far from the little I've seen.
alright then, until you get here.
Ok, let me go freshen up and i'll be on my way to yours.
No worries mate, expecting you.
