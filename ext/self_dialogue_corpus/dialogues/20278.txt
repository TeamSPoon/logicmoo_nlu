Have you seen the movie Juno?
Yeah I've seen it and really enjoyed it
What did you like about it
The soundtrack was really good, because it featured a lot of my favorite artists, like Kimya Dawson
Yeah the soundtrack was good.
What actors performance did you like the best.
I think Michael Cera did a great job
What about Ellen Page
To be honest, her performance was so forced
Really?
Yeah, except that one scene where she is crying in the end
Thats the scene that stole my heart!
But my favorite scene was at the end, when Michael Cera's character was hugging her in the hospital bed
Yeah it was a very touching scene
Yeah, I cried when i saw it in theaters
What year was that?
Around 2008 I think
Wow has it really been that long?
Yeah, it's a pretty good film
one of my favorites
