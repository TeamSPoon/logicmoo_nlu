Are you a Bears fan at all?
I really don't like the Bears.
Understandable. So, I guess you're a Packers fan?
I'm more partial to the Packers, yeah.
The Bears had a really rough time last season.
Yeah, I feel like they're losing fans.
I can't believe they only had three wins last season.
It doesn't seem like they'll have many more this coming season either.
Yeah, I feel like they gave up too much in the draft.
Me too. It wasn't worth losing their picks for a quarterback.
I agree to an extent. They did need a quarterback, though.
Yeah, but they still have huge problems in their defense that could have been addressed.
True, they did pick up a tight end, though.
They got Sheenan, right?
Yeah, and Trubinsky as a quarterback.
Trubinsky was actually the top prospect for quarterbacks.
Yeah, he was. I still think they gave up way too much for him.
I agree. Trubinsky and Sheenan are not going to be able to carry the team themselves.
Definitely not. They're still ranked 32nd overall.
That's not the spot you want to be in starting off a new season.
