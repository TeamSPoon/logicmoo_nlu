Hey mom, what is a good movie?
Honey, I'm busy. Go watch Alice Through the Looking Glass.
Oh, the movie with Johnny Depp? I heard it was a flop.
No honey, it was good, okay? The time guy was very cool looking.
Wow Mom, do you have a crush on him?
Yeah, if I was Alice I would steal the time orb, and try to get the time man to marry me.
I like the mad hatter.
Yeah, because you are a little bit mental.
Do you still love me?
Yeah, I guess so...Go watch the red queen, that's my mood right now.
