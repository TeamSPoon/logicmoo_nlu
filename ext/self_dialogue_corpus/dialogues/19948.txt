So what are you listening to?
Nothing right now, I'm trying to make up a conversation.
... okay then... anyway, what have you been listening to.
Mostly children's music.
That's right you have a son, don't you.
Yeah, I've been playing a lot of cds for him.
What's his favorite?
The Do Re Wee name song.
I've never heard of that one.
It's a song that names all the friends in the room and has motions to the verses.
Do you like it?
Surprisingly, I'm not as fed up with it as I could be after hearing it for the millionth time and sing it for the houndred thousandth.
Ha ha ha...
It's actually pretty good for a children's song.
What do you listen to when he's not around.
When is he not around?
... well... when he's napping and stuff.
I usually have it quiet so as not to disturb him.
Well, that makes sense.
Yeah, I can hear myself think, but I wonder about the thoughts sometimes, because it's like I'm talking to myself.
