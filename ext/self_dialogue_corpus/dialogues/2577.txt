Have you ever gone to an NFL game?
I haven't. Have you?
Yes. I love going to live games.
Would you say it's fun for people who don't know a lot about football?
I think the exciting atmosphere makes it fun for anyone.
I always wondered how the kids would like it.
I see kids getting very involved. I think it depends how far away they are.
True. I feel like if the seats were too far they would be bored.
NFL games are a great family event, though. It's fun to paint your faces and get into it.
Are the tickets expensive?
It varies greatly.
Depending on where you sit?
That and other factors. Playoff games and the Super Bowl are more expensive.
I've always wanted to see a Super Bowl live.
Yeah, those tickets are very expensive and highly sought after.
I've always liked the Chargers. Maybe I will look into buying some tickets soon.
You should. If you buy some early season tickets it won't be expensive.
That way I'll be more likely to get some good seats, also.
Yes. The Chargers are looking like they'll do better this year, too.
That's awesome to hear about my favorite team.
