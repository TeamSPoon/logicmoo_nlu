When's the last time Christina Aguilera released an album?
I can't remember. It's been at least four years.
I really enjoy her music. I wish she would release another album soon.
Yeah. The last big hit I can remember of hers was Candyman.
I know, and that song came out so long ago.
She has probably just been busy with other projects.
You're right. She was working on The Voice for a few years.
I also heard she was offering singing lessons through an online course.
Really? Wow!
Yep. She definitely has the industry experience to teach people.
