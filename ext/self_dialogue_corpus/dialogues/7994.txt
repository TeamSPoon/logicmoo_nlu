I think the Disney Channel helped to produce some really good pop music.
You mean like songs from Hannah Montana?
That's one example.There's also The Jonas Brothers.
I love the song Kid's From the Future.
I do, too.
A song I love was done by Mitchell Musso and was called Shout It.
That was good and I wish he had recorded more songs.
Let's not forget all of the great pop songs from the High School Musical series.
Like Breaking Free?
That and /Fabulous.
