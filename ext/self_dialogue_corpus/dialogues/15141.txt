Who would you say is your favorite male musician, and who is your favorite female musician?
Female musician is easy. Beyonce Knowles.
Yeah, she's pretty cool.
I'm a huge fan of hers. I think her new album Lemonade was outstanding.
It had some hot tracks. OK, what about favorite male musician?
Can it be someone who is no longer alive?
Sure.
Then David Bowie. The man was a genius, and I'm sad he's no longer with us.
I loved Ziggy Stardust.
He was such a fascinating character. And his music was sublime.
Can you imagine a collaboration between Beyonce and Bowie?
That would be beyond awesome! Too bad it will never happen.
Yeah, it's a shame.
So who are your favorite male and female musicians?
I'd probably say Prince for male, Jean Grae for female.
I obviously know who Prince is, but who is Jean Grae?
She is a rapper. Born in South Africa, grew up in NYC.
Huh. Never heard of her.
Yeah, she's not super mainstream. But her music is top notch!
I'll check her out, thanks for the recommendation.
