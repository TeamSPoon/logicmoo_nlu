Who is your favorite character from Star Wars?
Princess Leia, she is so awesome.
I like Leia too.  She is a strong role model for girls.
So is Rey.  I can't wait to see what happens next.
I know right, do you think that she's the "Last Jedi"
I don't know, maybe it's Luke.
He was so cool in the Force Awakens.
I know I got chills!
I wish that they hadn't killed off Han.
I know that just broke my heart,
