Do you think Peter Parker was a better student before he became Spiderman?
It seems like being Spiderman held his studies back
The science in the movie is believable
I don't think you can just have a small sun in your lab
Yeah but fusion is something that people were having a hard time with when the movie was made
It was dumb how he made the same mistake with the second one, just made a bigger one
Otto Octavius was a victim of the claws
He was afraid of them
He was very upset about his wife
It is kind of like real life in that new discoveries are dangerous
