What ever happened to Britney Spears?
She's still around.
I haven't heard a new song from her in a long time.
I think she has a show in Las Vegas now.
She was the Queen of pop music for a while.
It seemed after she broke up with Justin Timberlake she didn't handle that well.
She had a couple of hit songs but nothing like she was in the late 90s.
It's got to be tough to be that famous at 18.
Justin Bieber was more famous at a younger age.
Yeah, well look how well he's handling it.
