Did you see the game between the Giants and Mets yesterday?
Yes, it was on really early on the West Coast, but I was able to watch it online at work.
Wow, that's some dedication you have.
Well, I am a fan of the Giants, and work wasn't too busy.
Can you believe the Giants were able to come back in the 9th inning like that?
No, I was really surprised.  They have been on a horrible losing streak.
Yea, the Giants have looked really bad lately.  What is going on?
Well they have had some key injuries, and some of their free agent signings aren't working out.
True, it's quite a shame what happened to Bumgarner and how he got injured.
Yes, but I mean the Mets are in the same boat.
That is true.  Giants and Mets met in the playoffs last season, and this year they both look like they've regressed.
Well the Mets had a really promising pitching rotation.  But injuries have really hurt them.
Harvey, Syndegaard.  Yea, you are right.
For a while there the Mets looked like they were going to be a dynasty.
Yes, and now, all bets are off.  They just can't keep their pitchers healthy.
What happened to Matt Harvey is such a shock.  He looked destined to be the next big star.
This is true.  Well at least the Giants won 3 World Series already, right?
Yes.  Our fanbase can't complain too much when we've done so well in this decade.
Yea, I think the Giants are due for some bad years.
Well I wouldn't go that far.  But yea, there is that fear that the window might be closed.
