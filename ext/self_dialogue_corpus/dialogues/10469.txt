Hi, what is it your listening to on your ipod?
Oh, it's the new Jimmy Buffett album that just came out.
No kidding, what is it called?
Jimmy Buffett-Live at Wrigley Field.
Oh wow, he is great to see live!
Yeah so much fun!
It's more like a party than a concert.
Yeah it is, those Parrotheads know how to party!
Yeah they do, how is the album?
It's good, it has a lot of songs on it!
Thats a plus, is it old stuff or new stuff?
It is a little bit of both actually.
Oh thats pretty cool.
Yeah is has a lot of the classics like Volcano, and Margaritaville of course.
Oh yeah those are classics for sure.
There are also some new ones as well mixed in.
Nice, he always puts a lot of songs on his albums.
Yeah, can you believe he is 70 years old?
No way that is impressive!
Yeah, and still going strong!
