I really can't deal with the radio these days.
Why not? It's not too bad.
It's just that so much of it is lacking strong melodies.
Well to be fair, you are a jazz fan. You don't hear much jazz on the radio.
I like pop too! Would you consider Andrea Bocelli pop?
Absolutely not, my friend. He's kind of crossover though.
I guess I just resonate with strong voices like June Christy or Dean Martin.
June Christy was an absolute goddess.
Agreed. She is so underrated.
Have you heard her Gone For the Day album?
No, I only have Something Cool and The Misty Miss Christy, both in mono.
She has so many good albums in her discography.
You're right. I should check them all out.
And if you like June Christy, Blossom Dearie is essential.
I do have a couple of her LPs. You know she used to perform in Paris?
I did. Her and Josephine Baker were huge in Paris.
Josephine Baker is another one who had such an incredible voice.
There will never be another one like her.
Or another Billie Holiday or June.
They really were a cut above.
