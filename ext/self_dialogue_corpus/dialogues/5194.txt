Have you seen Pinocchio?
Yes, but not since I was a kid.
What do you remember about it?
I remember how Pinocchio was a wooden puppet who was made real.
Well of course, what else?
When he would tell a lie his nose would grow.
Do you remember pleasure island?
Yes, those poor kids turned into donkeys.
I liked the part inside the whale, what about you?
The whale was scary, I liked the blue fairy.
