have you seen pinocchio?
of course, its a classic.
so what was the deal when pinocchio went off to school
what do you mean?
its kind of strange, at one point he goes off where a bunch of boys get turned into donkeys
oh yeah, that was crazy
they never really address what happens to the rest of the boys after they are turned into donkey
that is kind of weird.
a lot of the parts of the movie are strange like that. later he goes to bottom of the ocean to get gepetto out of a whale
i never really thought about it
