Seven was the creepiest movie ever.
It's actually got a 7 in it.
Huh?  What do you mean.
The title of the movie is actually Se7en.  It has the number 7 instead of a v.
That's odd.  I get it, but still odd.
I winced at the ending for sure.
It's not every day you find your wife's head in a box and learned she was pregnant.
That was genuinely screwed up.
That was the point though.  It wasn't a happy ending movie at all.
I wish they would make more like that.
