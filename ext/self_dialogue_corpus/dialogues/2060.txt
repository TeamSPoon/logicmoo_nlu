Did you know the Packers are named after a meat company?
...What?
Yeah, they sponsored them somehow.
Like the workers played for the team, or?
No, it was like a local factory that paid for their jerseys and such.
Oh, like coke does now.
Yeah, but local. They're one of the oldest teams.
I bet they're worth a lot, then.
Yeah, but they're one of the few professional teams you can still buy stock from.
So how come you can't buy stock from other teams?
I don't know if you can't, it's more that you can't just do it from a stoke broker.
Oh. So how do you do it?
Well there's only a small amount, and it's not really seen as an investment.
So you can't make money off it?
You could, but it's more of a family heirloom thing.
Fan cred?
Exactly; it's like how most people don't scalp tickets because they actually want to go to the game. It means something.
That's actually really cool. So are you looking forward to them this season?
Honestly, no. In fact I just read an article about how they're probably doomed this next season.
Ouch. Well, at least they've still got that sweet, sweet fan cred!
