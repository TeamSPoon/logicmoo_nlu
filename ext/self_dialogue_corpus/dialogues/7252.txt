Until now thereâ€™s not better animated movie than Big Heroes 6.
That's correct. Big heroes 6 it's the best in all their aspects.
All the characters have a wonderful and funny performance.
Yes, although the storyline was kind of sad, it was vey nice at the end.
I would like to have someone like Baymax.
I want one too. He's the better companion for Hiro after Tadashi's death.
I hope in a sequel Tadashi is alive as Callaghan's daughter.
I don't think so. His death was very sad but Baymax helped with tha situation.
Well, but at least a second part will be enough for the fans.
I hope so, and with the participation of Stan Lee it will be a total success.
