I'm thinking of introducing my daughter to Old Yeller.
Good movie.  She's gonna cry though.
Yeah I know, I'm probably going to cry too.
Doesn't everyone at the end of that movie?
Yeah, I want her to see it but I don't want to see her cry.
She'll be fine.
I know she will but she cries for tons of movies.
I haven't seen that movie in so long I hardly remember it.
I remember the dog not taking the food he set out.
Yeah I remember that part too.
I remember he was a good dog.
I also remember he saved everyone.
Yeah, I think early in the movie one of the cows had rabies or something.
Yeah I think so too.
Of course the end is traumatic.
It was. I felt so bad for him.
The dog he loved so much was beyond saving.
And he had to shoot him.
But they got a puppy in the end.
Yeah, kind of a small prize to losing Old Yeller.
