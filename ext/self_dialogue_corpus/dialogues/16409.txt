Hey, what's up?
Not much, what about you?
Eh, about the same. Just listening to some Lorde.
Lorde? I've heard of her but I don't think I've listened to any of her songs.
Really?
Yeah, I don't know.
She's a fantastic singer; One of the best, I think.
You've gotta be kidding.
No, I'm serious.
Isn't she so young, though?
So? She's got the pipes.
I don't know, I like Stevie Nicks and stuff like that.
Lorde's new album is shaking me up.
Good or bad shaking?
Good, all of her songs give me chills.
Well, if you say she's really that good, then I'll give her a listen.
Good! I love Stevie Nicks too, but it's hard to compare different styles and genres.
Yeah, it is. I'll try Lorde out.
Nice, thanks man. Let me know how you like her.
I will.
