How bout those Giants?
What do you mean? They're like 6 games under .500.
Yeah, but those three titles in a row were great.
Yeah they were. I loved the 2014 World Series against the Royals.
When is Maddy coming back?
Probably after the all star break sometime.
Are you a Giants fan too?
Yes, but I am realistic about them.
Well, miracles happen.
I bet they can comeback after the all star break.
Do you think the Dodgers are good?
They have only one pitcher and Justin Turner just got hurt.
Yeah that will hurt them.
Do you like the Mets?
No
Their pitching staff is unfortunate.
Yeah, they have to pretend Harvey is actually an ace.
I am excited for the playoffs.
This might be the Nationals year.
Some Giants fan you are.
