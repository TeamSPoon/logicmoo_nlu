What have you been into as far as pop is concerned?
I've always been a big fan of Selena Gomez.
I do like her! Her songs are always on the radio.
That is usually how I get my fill of pop songs actually. Who do you like?
I will admit to liking Chainsmokers, their music is so catchy.
Same here, I can't help but sing a long every time their song comes on.
I especially love the collaboration they did with Coldplay!
Don't get me started about Coldplay, I've loved them for decades.
Me too! I'm so glad they're still making music years later.
I hope they never stop.
