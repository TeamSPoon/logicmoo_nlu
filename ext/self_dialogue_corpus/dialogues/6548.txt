Did you like the Toy Story movies?
Yes, I really did, I can remember seeing the first one in the theater.
Which one of them is your favorite?
I'm not sure, I really like each of them so much.  I guess I'd say Toy Story 3 probably.
Yeah, that was probably my favorite too.  What did you like about it?
I was really impressed with the direction the movie took, and how they dealt with Andy growing up.
I know, and then they even added in some pretty scary parts.
For sure, I was really scared for a while, and then I even started to cry.
Yeah, I cried to.  Although, honestly, I cry at most of the Disney movies that I watch.
It is pretty normal for them to pull on your emotional strings, and trying to convince you that Woody would die is doing just that.
