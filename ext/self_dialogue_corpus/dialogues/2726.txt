How are you feeling about the Cowboys this year?
Really bad.
You think they don't have a chance
No I'm really not a fan these days
I agree, they've been pretty disappointing
I just can't get behind them because they throw away games
You were a fan for so long
Yes since I was a kid but it was just painful to watch really
Do you follow anyone now?
I live on the West coast now so I go to some 49ers games?
I've been impressed recently
Sure not bad at all. I enjoy the atmosphere
I've been a lifelong Saints guy but lately I'm really impressed with the Seahawk
They have a really tight team
It's pretty aspirational I think
It will be interesting to see if they can keep it up
That's the test, my Saints faded away the next year
That's the difference between good and great
Will you be going to the Superbowl
No way. I'll never go again unless by some miracle the Cowboys make it there
