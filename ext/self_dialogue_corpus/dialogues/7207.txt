What's your favorite scene in The Little Mermaid?
My favorite scene is probably in the royal kitchen with the singing chef.
Ah les poissons. I always found that song hilarious
It has the same tune as "Be Our Guest" from Beauty and the Beast.
What really??
Yes! It makes me laugh every time I think about it.
My favorite scene is probably around the very end where Triton lets Ariel become a human and stay with Eric.
Oooh, yes the glittering water is beautiful.
Just that whole scene is so pretty and just what you want.
A happy ending.
