You see that new Kendrick Lamar video that dropped yesterday?
I did. Pretty solid stuff, as always.
Yeah, Kendrick definitely knows how to make a interesting video.
I wouldn't say that it's as good as the 'Humble' video.
That one would be hard to beat. Lots of interesting visuals.
What did you think of his new album?
Man, honestly, I liked it OK but I don't think it's nearly on the level of his last two.
Wow, really? I think it's great.
It's an above average rap album for sure, but coming in the wake of two stone cold classics, it was almost boring.
OK, now you're just being unreasonable.
I know, I'm definitely in the minority on this one.
Tell me a better rap album from this year.
Oh, that's easy - Run the Jewels 3.
That one came out in 2016, smart guy.
I know, but it came out on Dec 25, so it's basically a 2017 album.
Fair enough. That was a really solid album.
Those guys can do no wrong as far as I'm concerned.
They're great, but better than my man Kung Fu Kenny? No.
To each his own, man.
Ha, agreed. But you're still wrong.
