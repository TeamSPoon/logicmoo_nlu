You know what movie I recently watched again?  'Hercules.'
Wow, I haven't seen that one in forever.
Wasn't it such an excellent movie?
I loved it when I was younger.  I always became so emotional during it.
When Hercules finally became a god and defeated Hades, it was such a powerful moment.
I loved the training montage scenes.  Danny DeVito as Phil was hilarious.
He was the faun, right?
Yup.  I also loved the music of the movie.
What was your favorite?
'Go the Distance' was wonderful.
