What did you think of Zootopia?
I really liked it! It seemed different from a lot of Disney movies.
It was a change to have a modern story rather than something fairy-tale.
Well, all the characters are animals, so it's not super-realistic.
No, but it seemed like it was about modern life.
I really liked Judy's determination to become a police officer even though people doubted her.
Yeah, and it was fun watching her deal with criminals even though she's a little bunny.
And the animation was spectacular.
I know, the city looks so wild, with all the different areas for different animals!
I'd love to see Disney do something else in this style. Maybe we'll get a sequel?
