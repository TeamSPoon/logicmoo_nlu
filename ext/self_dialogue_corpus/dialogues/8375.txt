So, are you suprised that The Chainsmokers have hot the pop music charts?
No. It seems a lot of alternative bands go mainstream pop.
Like whom?
Take No Doubt for example.
Isn't that the group Gwen Stefani was in?
Yes. They were a Ska band, then one of their songs hit the top 40 and they went pop.
Wow, i did not know that.
Yes, it caused strife with the band, they broke up and Gwen went solo.
Amasing! Any other bands that transitioned over from Alternative to pop music?
Oh, lots of them have.
