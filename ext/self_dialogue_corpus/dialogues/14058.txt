What do you like most about Lady Gaga?
I like that she speaks up for what she believes in.
Yes, you can hear that in a lot of her songs.
Which ones do you think have the most powerful messages?
Born This Way is very beautiful.
Yeah, she displays lots of love in that song.
Have you ever heard about the song she did that donated money to sexual abuse victims?
I haven't heard of that. What song is it?
Yeah, it called "Til it Happens to You".
I'll have to look that up on Youtube.
