So who is your favorite Beatle?
I'd say Paul is.
Yeah, I think I'm with you there.  John made some good songs but Paul is a genius.
Yeah, Sgt. Pepper was pretty much all his idea.  John knew the vibe of what Paul was going for and made some good ones too though.
Yeah that's true.  Really though, George Martin played a huge part in all that as well.
Yeah, his work in the studio was unbelievable.
I don't think the Beatles could have made it to where they got without Martin.  That guy knew some serious tricks.
Yeah it was crazy.  I'm sure what Brian Wilson did with Pet Sounds gave them a lot of ideas as well.  I think that's why Paul wanted to do Sgt. Pepper in the first place.
Yeah I do believe that's right.  Pet Sounds in phenomenal as well but I think Sgt. Pepper is still better.
The Beatles really did everything better.  They were just musical geniuses.
