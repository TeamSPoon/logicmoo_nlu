Well the rock part is why.
Yea,we both like rock n roll and those bands rock.
Yes they do with a little country touch.
I know. It's almost like we're contradicting ourselves.
It could be seen as that I guess.
Either way I love it.
Would have loved to seen lynyrd skynyrd all together.
I can't even imagine.
That plane crash was terrible.
What a shame and waste.
