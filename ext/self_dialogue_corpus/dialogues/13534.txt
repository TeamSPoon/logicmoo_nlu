Did you like Empire Strikes Back?
No, it was too dark.
Whet? It was the best Star Wars movie ever.
I like the first one better. It was brighter and happier.
I can't believe this. You didn't think it was cool when Luke fought Vader lost his hand and found out Vader was his father?
Um, no.
You're hopeless. What's so great about the first Star Wars?
Remember the the scene where the ship flies overhead and keeps going and going...
Yes.
That was really cool.
