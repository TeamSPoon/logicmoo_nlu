Have you seen the new Guardians of the Galaxy?
No, I haven't. Is that the second movie in the series?
Did you know David A. Hess wrote and performed the soundtrack on Last House on the Left?
I didn't. Wasn't he the main bad guy, Krug?
The movie Clueless was based on a Bronte novel called Emma.
I always loved that movie, and now I know why!
Do you enjoy the new Marvel movies?
No. I'm not a big fan of their lack of story.
Did you know the main actor in the movie Get Out is actually from the UK?
No I didn't! You can't hear his accent at all.
Have you ever seen the movie Coyote Ugly?
Isn't that the one about the bar dancing?
Did you hear they were remaking the movie Flatliners?
Did that movie have Kiefer Sutherland and Kevin Bacon?
Are you a fan of Texas Chainsaw Massacre?
Yes, but only the original. Gunnar Hansen did a great job with playing Leatherface.

I thought I recognized her face from somewhere else!
Have you seen Rob Zombie's remake of Halloween?
I did! It was scarier than the original.
