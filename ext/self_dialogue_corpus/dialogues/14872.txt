Hey, do you like romantic comedies?
Yes, I love them?! What are your favorites?
I really like the ones from the 1990's and early 2000's. Like How to Lose a Guy in 10 days.
Oh yea, that one was great. I really love Matthew Mcconaughey.
Oh man, me too! He is so hot. Have you seen him in Failure to Launch?
Yes, I did. But I'm not a big fan of Sarah Jessica Parker.
Me neither, but I really liked that Bradley Cooper was in it.
Oh, I forgot he was! He is also a cutie.
Except I didn't like his character in the Hangover.
Yea, that one he was kind of annoying in.
