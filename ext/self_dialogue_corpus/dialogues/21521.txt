Do you like Godzilla movies?
Well it depends on what series we're talking about.
What do you mean?
Well, first of all there's the original Godzilla movie that came out in 1954.
That's the first Japanese one, right?
Right, and it's a lot different than the Japanese ones that came after.
How so?
Well the series started to become rather goofy soon after, almost like a kid's movie.
A big difference from how it started, huh?
Yeah, but then in the 80's they started taking it seriously again.
Some of my favorite Godzilla movies are from the 80's and 90's.
Definitely a great time to be a Godzilla fan, but then the Americans got their hands on the series.
Oh no, are you talking about the 1998 American Godzilla movie?
Oh yeah baby, that giant piece of crap.
Do you think the Americans redeemed themselves with the new Godzilla movie that they just made?
Maybe, but it's hard to forget Ferris Bueller petting Godzilla.
So are the Japanese still making Godzilla movies?
Yeah, the latest one brings the series full circle, and is very true to the spirit of the original 1954 movie.
It's great to see that they still have it.
I'm just hoping that Godzilla vs. King Kong doesn't ruin everything!
