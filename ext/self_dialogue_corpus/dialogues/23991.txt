I just saw the new Transformers.
They made a new Transformers?
Yeah. It's called Transformers: The Last Knight.
Was it good?
I think you already know the answer to that.
Yeah, I heard it was pretty terrible. Michael Bay hasn't made a good movie since Bad Boys
Hey, I actually liked Pain & Gain too!
I didn't see that one.
It had The Rock and Mark Wahlberg in it. They were amazing
I love The Rock! I thought I'd seen all of his stuff.
It only came out a few years ago, but it wasn't in theaters for very long I don't think. If you really like The Rock, give it a shot.
So Bad Boys and Pain & Gain are Michael Bay's only good movies I guess.
I think that old movie he did called The Rock was also pretty good.
Wait, there was a movied called The Rock too? Let me guess, the main actor was Dwayne Johnson?
Haha, no, it was a Sean Connery film from the 90s. It was really cool, especially for its time.
Woah, that was confusing! He has to do a sequel now, though, and hire The Rock.
Definitely, I think with all the remakes Hollywood is doing it would be pretty good!
Well, glad to know the new Transformers isn't worth it. Was thinking about going to see a movie later and now I know one to avoid.
Hey, I thought you didn't know it was playing?
I didn't, but now I won't be tempted to go see it and can give in to my inner child and see Cars 3 instead.
