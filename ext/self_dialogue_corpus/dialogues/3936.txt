Any recommendations on a good thriller I can watch with my girlfriend this weekend?
Hm, I don't know. Maybe Black Swan.
What's that about?
It's about a ballet dancer who has "performance anxieties" and loses her mind. Natalie Portman and Mila Kunis are in it.
Oh I like those actresses, but I'm not sure I wanna watch a ballerina thriller. My girlfriend might like it, though.
Yeah, that's why I recommended that one. How about one of the Batman movies?
She's seen all of those. I want to watch something more like Fight Club, but she has seen that too.
How about Inception?
I that's a good movie! I'm not sure she has seen that one, but I know she will like it.
Yeah Leonardo DiCaprio is actually pretty good in it. If she doesn't like that one, you can try watching Gone Girl.
