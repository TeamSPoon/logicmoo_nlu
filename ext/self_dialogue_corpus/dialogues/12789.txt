Did you see Rogue One?
Yeah, I did. I like Star Wars and all, but that one was a lot more intense than the previous ones.
Yeah, I thought so too. It was more like a war movie, but set in the Star Wars universe.
My thoughts exactly. It was still a cool movie though.
Who was your favorite character?
Hmm, that's a tough one. So many good new characters in that movie. I'd have to go with Cassian I guess.
Yeah, he was cool. I liked Jynn the best I think, but K2-SO really stole the show.
Haha, yeah, he was awesome! I liked how blunt he was!
Kinda like C-3PO but with a lot more sass and attitude!
Exactly! Hey, want to rent the DVD this weekend. This conversation makes me want to see it again!
