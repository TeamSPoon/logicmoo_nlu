Do you like thriller movies?
Yes! Do you?
They are the best genre.
I wish they would remake some more Hitchcock films.
Something like the Birds.
That movie made me so afraid of birds, for years.
All of his movies played so well into human fear.
I like the way the suspense seemed so real.
Yep, like the plot could happen to any one.
I think that is what made all of his movies so thrilling.
