So have you heard the theory about Rey?
You're going to have to be more specific; pretty much everyone has a theory about Rey.
I mean the one where Obiwan is Rey's father.
What? How would that work?
The idea is that Obiwan got married on Tatooine and then had Rey really close to the end of his time.
I don't know if that timeline works out.
Well, she could be his grandchild then!
Why do you want it to be Obiwan?
The series has always been about a Kenobi and a Skywalker, imo. It'd be so much better to keep it that way than to make it about one family.
And just have it be about friendship instead? I can see the merit in that, I guess.
