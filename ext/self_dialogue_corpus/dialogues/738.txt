It seems like the Seahawks might be on the downswing, but they still have a good coach.
Yea, they have that and a great quarterback as well.
Yea, I agree, but I just keep wondering when Russell Wilson is going to ware down.
Yea, he is still young and hasn't yet.
Yea, I know. Some of these fast quarterbacks just ware down quickly.
Yea, we know RGIII did.
Yea, exactly, but it seems like Russell Wilson is less injury prone.
Yea, he seems to put himself in harms way less, but he needs to continue doing that.
Yea, if he can stay healthy and so can most of his team, they will still be a contender.
Yea, I agree, but there are a few teams still better in my eyes.
Yea, I'm not sure they can top the falcons.
Yea, especially if Matt Ryan has another repeat season.
Yea, he was amazing last year.
He was and he should be again. They have great receivers.
Yea, especially Julio Jones. That guy can fly.
Yea, it doesn't hurt to have one of the best running backs in the league.
Yea, they do and even their backup is even good.
Yea and they finally have a great defense.
Yea, they really were all around good last year.
Yea, its just too bad they couldn't win the big game.
