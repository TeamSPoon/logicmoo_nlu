My daughter and I watched Brave last week.
Oh, I love that movie!
Me too. Sharing it with my daughter made me love it even more.
Remember how much we loved the posture scenes?
Where they would stand up straight and quietly walk through a room of men?
Yes!  And all the men would suddenly shape up.
My daughter is trying that out now.
Awesome! Merida is a Disney princess that you can feel good about your daughter emulating.
Yes. She is fully clothed, and refuses to be a child bride.
I'm so glad Disney bought Pixar.  They really do some awesome stuff.
