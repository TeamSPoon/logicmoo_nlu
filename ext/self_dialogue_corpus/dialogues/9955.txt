You know what was an underrated movie?  The Fugitive.
Wow, what year did that come out?
1993 I think.
I remember seeing it in theater way back when.
Harrison Ford did a great job in that movie as the doctor.
But Tommy Lee Jones stole the show.  That dude is all business.
I liked how the plot continually advanced.  They didn't waste time on a dumb backstory.
That was crazy when he jumped off the dam.
Nobody could survive that.  That was the only part I didn't like.
Didn't bother me.  Made for a great visual.
