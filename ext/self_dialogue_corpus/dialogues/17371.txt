Are you going to see any concerts anytime soon?
I'm not sure. I might see Incubus in August.
Oh, Incubus! Nice. When are they playing?
First week of August and guess the opener...
Hm.. Cage The Elephant?
That would be nice, but I'll give you another try.
Imagine Dragons?
Nope. Jimmy Eat World!
Woah. A blast from the past.
Yeah, tell me about it!
I saw them open for Foo Fighters almost 9 yrs ago.
Yeah, they've been around for a long awhile.
I remember listening to them in middle and high school.
Yeah, I remember hearing them at parties in high school.
Feels like a different world, doesn't it?
Sure does. Life moves fast.
I'm getting nostalgic now. Going to listen to them again.
You should. Also their new stuff isn't that bad.
Can't wait to check it out.
Tell me what you think afterwards!
