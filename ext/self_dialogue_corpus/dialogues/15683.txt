Man, whatever happened to that bull Canibus?
I think L L Cool J ended his career.
What you mean?
Remember they had that beef over the song 4,3,2,1 ?
I didn't know they had beef.
Yeah. Canibus did a verse on the remix. L L thought it was a dis, so he deleted the verse from the song.
I think I do remember hearing about that. That song was still hot though.
Yeah. But Canibus bowed out of the game.
He was a beast. He did a feature with the Lost Boyz and like Redman.
Oh yeah. That song was called Beasts From the East.
Canibus had the hottest verse on the track.
Yeah he did, but A + had a verse on that track which was just as hot.
I forgot all about A +. What happened to him.
He was a young bull when he was in the game. He made like a solo album but it wasn't that hot.
I liked him. Do you remember M C Shan?
Do I remember? I got Living in the World of Hip Hop on like five of my playlists.
Yeah, that song was tight. I remember when Shan was beefing with KRS-One.
Yeah. Shan made The Bridge and then KRS came back with The BRidge is Over.
I know right. The way The Bridge is Over starts out? That bass line.
KRS was that dude. I liked him back when Scott La Rock was still alive.
