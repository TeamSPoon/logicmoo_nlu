Did you see the Chiefs hired a new GM?
No, I haven't been paying much attention this off season.
Yeah, I guess they let the last one go and it doesn't sound like it ended well.
Hmm, I wonder what could have happened, but I'm sure we'll never know everything.
The new GM sounds like he's been a coach or part of the team before, so hopefully that'll help.
I sure hope so! The Chiefs could really use some good luck.
I know, it's been years since they've even come close to making it to the Super Bowl!
It's been really hard to be a fan all these years, but yet we still show up every year.
Yep, and the ticket prices keep going up!
Yeah, my siblings have season tickets in the lower level and they're $850 for ten games! Don't even get me started on parking.
The parking is highway robbery!
I think I saw that it can get up to $60 per car if you don't pre-pay!
Man, that would be a nightmare! I'd never pay that to let my car sit in a parking lot!
Neither would I. I think I'm going to sit the season out and cheer on from home.
That sounds like it'll be easier. Maybe I can join you?
Absolutely! Let's start our own Chiefs Sunday tradition!
Maybe if we don't go, they'll do better. It wouldn't hurt to try!
I sure hope so. I haven't seen a Super Bowl with the Chiefs in my lifetime.
My parents had barely seen it either! Here's to hoping!
Let's go Chiefs!
