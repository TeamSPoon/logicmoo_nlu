Let's play a game:  I'll name an actor, and you name the best movie they've appeared in.
Ok, start.
Robert De Niro?
Wow, coming out with the big guns, huh?  So many good ones-- Deer Hunter, Godfather part 2, but I liked him best in Goodfellas.
Al Pacino?
Another toughie-- love Glengarry Glenross, love Scent of a Woman, but I'm gonna go with ...And Justice for All.
Patrick Swayze?
Haha, believe it or not, tough call between Dirty Dancing and Roadhouse.
Peter Weller?
Robocop, duh.
Tom Hanks?
He's been in everything, and he's generally excellent, but I'm gonna say Forrest Gump.
Naomi Watts?
Ah, you know she's my favorite actress.  Mullholland Drive-- she blew me away.
Kurt Russell?
I really like him a lot in Guardians of the Galaxy volume 2, but definitely the Thing.  I need to rewatch the Thing soon.
Liam Neeson?
He's great-- he trained Batman and Obi-Wan.  I'm going to say I liked him best in Taken.
Jack Nicholson?
Oh man, he's been awesome in so many things.  I loved him as the Joker in Tim Burton's Batman, but he really shined in the Shining.  Pun totally intended.
