What was your favorite Disney movie growing up?
The Lion King!
Oh, that's a good one.
Wait, I really liked The Little Mermaid too...
Yes, that one was my favorite- along with Aladdin.
A whole new world!!!
Hehe, the best karaoke song!
All those movies had the best songs to sing along to.
Right!? I used to have my sister write out the lyrics for me because back then it was only dial-up Internet.
Oh my gosh, we are so old.
