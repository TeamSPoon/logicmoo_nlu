Here's the thing, Batman Returns is a crime drama and its success as a film hinges on that fact.
Maybe, but I always kind of thought it hinged on Heath Ledger's performance, more than anything.
Ledger's performance was obviously important, but that just goes to further prove my point.
Well, he was the main criminal, granted, but without the costumes, capes and gadgets I think it would have been far less successful.
That's creating a false dichotomy, because Batman has always been a detective and the Joker has always been a criminal.
But, does it hang together without all of the outrageous flavor of the comic book world?
I think that characterization would be the necessary ingredient for that to be the case and it just so happens that these characters are from the world of DC Comics.
It's like a mash up of all the hope and altruism of the superhero genre, meeting head on with the cynicism and amorality of Crime Noir.
Except, Batman never loses hope, or gives in to that cynical viewpoint.
No, that part is embodied by others, namely the Joker, which is why I was right and Heath Ledger's performance is the integral ingredient.
