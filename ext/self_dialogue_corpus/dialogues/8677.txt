Have you seen the new Paramore music video?
Hard Times? Oh yeah.
What do you think of it?
I love the 80s style.
I do too. It even gets an A-ha feel at one point.
You mean like from the video for Take on Me?
Exactly. That kind of moving line and illustration.
I can totally see that.
Do you think Hard Times' music video is better than Still Into You's video?
No, I definitely prefer the video for Still Into You.
