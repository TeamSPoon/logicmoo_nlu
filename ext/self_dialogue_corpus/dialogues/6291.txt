I love when disney movies bring folklore and mythology into play.
Like when?
Like there was Hades and the titans from Hercules.
And Maui from Moana.
I think Te-Ka too.
I don't know about that.
Maybe she was a symbol for Pele the volcano goddess.
Maybe...
I'd love to here her backstory.
Definitely deserves another movie.
