How do you feel about the Minnesota Vikings?
I think they are a decent team. Not great but decent.
What makes you think that?
They lost Teddy Bridgewater to that nasty injury. No one knows if he will play again.
Yeah that was a bad situation, they do have Sam Bradford.
Bradford didn't do too bad last year given he didn't have an offseason to prepare.
Adrian Peterson is also gone, which is a bummer.
They did get Latavius Murray in Free Agency so they should be fine. AP was old.
They also drafted Dalvin Cook, so I agree their RB's will be just fine.
They do have a great defense, that secondary has become very solid.
Harrison Smith may be the best safety in the game
True, and Xavier Rhodes is becoming a shut down corner.
What you think their record will be this season?
I am thinking 9-7
Playoffs or no playoffs?
Wildcard playoff spot by the tip of their tongue. First round elimination
Who you think will win that divison?
Packers are still the team to beat while Aaron Rodgers is the QB.
I think that also, Bears, and Lions are still rebuilding.
The Lions yes, I have no idea what the Bears are doing.
