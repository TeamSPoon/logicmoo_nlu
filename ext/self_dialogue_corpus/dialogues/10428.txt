Have you ever really listened to movie soundtracks.
I mean, I am sure I have just never really thought on it.
I have been. And wow, some are just amazing.
I have liked some songs from movies
I just watched Tron, the listened to the songs. They were really good.
I do not think I have even seen that movie.
The new one is really good, hi tech stuff.
The effect are better than the older one I imagine?
For sure. The effects are out of this world.
I like really hi-tech movies. Like the Matrix.
Love that show. You know I really was not into the music on that film .
I do not even know any of its songs. There has only been one I can think that I listened to the music.
Which is that?
It was the one with heath ledger where he plays a Knight.
A Knight's Tale?
That is the one. Set long ago, but with rock music.
I loved the way they did that.
Made the movie have an edgy feel.
He also played in another Knight movie.
The Dark Knight?
