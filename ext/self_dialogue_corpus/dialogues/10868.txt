Did you like Vin Diesel in the Fast and the Furious?
Oh yeah. He was so cool.
Is he in anything else?
Yeah, I remember him in Pitch Black
That was a cool movie.
He brings that coolness to every role and he brought it to The Fast and the Furious.
Did you like his car in part 1?
Yes, it was cool. I liked the red.
Did you think his character would ever get killed off during the movies?
I thought so, since he did some crazy things.
