What do you think of Ricky Nelson?
Oh my god you like him?
I love him!
Wow,me too.
I remember watching Ozzie and Harriet when I was growing up and at the end of the show Ricky would sing.
I couldn't wait to hear what song.
I know. I usually already had the record before he sang it on the show.
Me too. The single was already out on a 45.
Exactly,and that's how he promoted it by singing it on the show.
He had a lot of hits.
He sure did.
How adout,Marylou,Travelin Man,Poor Little Fool.
They were really good songs.
Wasn't it called,Rockabilly music?
Yes you're right. It was called that.
He was another one that died in a plane crash.
Yes he was.
Remember the song It's Late?
Another hit for him.
Seemed like all his songs were hits.
