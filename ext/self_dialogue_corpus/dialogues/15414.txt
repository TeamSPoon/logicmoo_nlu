Have you heard of any of the rappers on that XXL magazine?
There's a lot of them in that magazine, that's what it's about.
I'm talking about the freshman class or whatever it is?
Oh yeah, I've heard of a few of them, some of them are pretty good.
Which one's?  I'm looking to hear some new music.
Well, I'm not a fan of xxtentacion, I'm pretty sure he beat his girlfriend.
That's not good, what about the others?
I like Amine, ugly god, kyle, and Pnb rock.
What are some good songs by them?
Caroline as awesome by Amine, and I think my favorite ugly god song is water.
What about Kyle and Pnb Rock?
Check out iSpy and Doubt it for Kyle and Selfish by PnB.
Awesome, I'll definitely check them out. Where'd you hear about them?
I heard about Kyle on Reddit, and then just kind of found the other ones.
Are any of them coming around here any time soon?
I'm not sure, I know PnB is playing about an hour from here next month.
Really? Let's go.
Alright, I'm down.  Let me know what you think of them.
I will man, I appreciate it!
No problem.
