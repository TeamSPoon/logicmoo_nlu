What are your  recent favorite movies?
I recently saw lion, I loved it.
I liked that one a lot too! Pretty incredible storyline and think ti is based on a real guy.
Hard to believe,the acting was really great in it too. Patel has been on my radar since the movie slumdog millionaire.
Slumdog.. what  great movie that was. Another good one he was in was the grand budapest hotel.. oh wait not him. Adrian brody.
I have seen that and ya was Adrian brody. Wes anderson films are great, did you see any other films of his?
I have seen some. The royal tennebaums, fantastic mr. fox, Moonrise kingdom. You?
Ya, I think I have seen every film of his.  I liked his style a lot. Life aquatic is a good one to watch if you haven't already.
Cool I will look into it. Any other recommendations of his other films?
Rushmore, is one of my favorites. Really funny.
Is Wes your favorite director ?
He is up there. I mean I love john waters a lot too. What about you?
So many great film directors, it is hard to say.
But if you had to list top three? Who would it be?
Hmm, Dennis Villeneuvue, Spielburg, Darren Aronofsky. Your top three?
Wow strong list. Wes Anderson, Woody allen, David Fincher.
I really think those are good movie directors as well. Loved Fincher since  I saw the movie Seven.
Ya Seven is one of my all time favorite films. Brad pitt was at his peak too.
That was Pitt's time to shine. He had a bunch of great films around then,  especially fightclub.
Fightclub is such a great movie. My second favorite Pitt film.
