I just saw this great horror movie called Lights Out.
I did not see that yet, is that the one with the blind man hunting people down?
No, that is Don't Breathe. Lights Out is way better.
What is it about?
A young woman from a dysfunctional family reluctantly goes back to help her kid brother face a supernatural threat, while her mentally ill mother resists her.
Is it a haunted house movie?
Not exactly. The being can appear in different places, but only when the lights are out.
That sounds like a childhood nightmare come to life! What is Don't Breathe about then?
Don't Breathe is the one with the blind man who turns out the lights to track some young thieves in his house.
Okay, I think I know the difference now.
