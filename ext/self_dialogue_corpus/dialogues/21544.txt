Hey, do you have my copy of Django Unchained?
Oh, I forgot it, its at my house.
What did you think?
I loved it! You know how much I love Tarantino movies though.
I thought for sure that Leo was going to get the Oscar for this role.
Me too. He totally got robbed.
As usual.
What did you think about the plot line?
I liked it a lot, I like the idea of a freed slave getting his wife back.
Yeah, with help of a bounty hunter no less.
Its not a bad deal when you think about it. Get free, get a job, and get your wife back.
True. Though it was a bit more complicated than that.
Well obviously.
I can't believe that Leonardo DiCaprio actually played a bad guy. He's always so nice!
I read that Leonardo DiCaprio,was uncomfortable with how horrible and explicitly racist his character was.
Well wouldn't you be?
Yes, I couldn't imagine having to say all those words, in front of other people.
Samuel L Jackson actually helped him through that.
Really?
Yes, he told Leo it was just another Tuesday to everyone there and not to feel bad.
