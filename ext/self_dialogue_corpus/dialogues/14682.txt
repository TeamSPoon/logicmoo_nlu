How about the Rockets just giving up on the series?
Yeah thats embarassing
Bad enough the fans showed up late.
Put had no problem complaining.
That and they had a 7 man rotation.
That will kill you all day everyday.
I agree with you on that point.
You cant go in with a bench that shallow.
You also need to get guys around Harden.
I think hes got a great cast.
He did finish one of the best seaons ever but I dont know if he can keep doing that.
They refuse to play defense.
People want to be just like the Warriors.
Yeah but they play D.
I forgot about that.
How do you forget about Draymond Green?
Slipped my mind you could say.
Hes always like a defensive player of the year.
I dont know how I could forget
Hey youre getting old happens to us all
