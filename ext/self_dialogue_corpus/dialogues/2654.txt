Did you hear How Tom Brady upset the Pittsburgh Penguin fans?
No what did the Patriots quarterback do now.
He posted a picture of himself touching the Stanley cup.
So i assume Steelers fans are thinking he ruined it some how
Yes it was funny reading all the tweets of fans telling him to get his hand off the Pens Stanley Cup.
Well maybe he jinxed himself and the Steelers will defeat the Patriots.
I hope the Steelers make it to the playoff i would love for them to win another ring.
They already have 6 how many more do you want.
As many as we can get. I just dont want the Patriots to tie with use or get more superbowl wins then us.
I dont think anyone wants the Patriots to win much of anything.
I would like to go to the Steelers first home game against the Cleveland browns.
When is that
I am pretty sure it is September 10
Do you know what time it is
It is a noon game against the Browns.
I wouldnt mind seeing it.
I think it is cheaper then normal since it is a preseason game,
We should go see the game together
Ok i would like that lets make plans for it
Ok that sounds like fun
