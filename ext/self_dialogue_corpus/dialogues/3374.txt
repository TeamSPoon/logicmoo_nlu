Have you seen the new horror movie Get Out?
Is it the one directed by Jordan Peele?
Yes! It was a low budget movie, but it grossed so much.
I saw that one! It was so good!
It just shows never to underestimate a movie base on their budget.
So true.  The story line was so intense.
I was at the edge of my seat the entire time.  Who would have thought Rose's family would be so crazy?
I would have ran if I met her family.  Chris was so brave to stick it out for the weekend.
I know! Who would have thought Rod would recognize Logan, or else they wouldn't have figured everything out.
That's what makes this film so unpredictable.
