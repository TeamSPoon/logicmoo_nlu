Who is your favorite pop artist/group right now?
I would have to say my favorite is The Chain Smokers.
Really? Their music is so generic.
Well, everything sounds similar today.  Who would you say your favorite artist is?
I'd have to say my favorite right now is Bruno Mars.
Seriously? And you think The Chainsmokers are a bad choice?
Hey, Bruno Mars has a lot of range and you can't deny his style.
He's just trying to be new Michael Jackson and you know it.
Well you've seen that youtube video where a person recreated every chain smoker song right?  Their music is so generic.
Well agree to disagree.  You do you and I'll do me.
