Have you seen the latest Captain America movie?
Yes, Is one of my favorites! I really liked it!
Do you know the name of the actor on the movie?
Yes, his name is Chris Evans.
That is right! Wasn't he also in the Fantastic Four?
Yes! that's correct, that was kinda awkward, suddenly becoming another super hero, though he blended very well to Captain America, it suits him.
Have you seen him on other movies other than doing Captain America or in the Fantastic Four?
Of course! He has many, Celullar, Push, Scott Pilgrim vs. The World, and Gifted among many.
Which one is your favorite?
I would have to be Celullar, her wan´t as famous then and he gave an all star performance.
Really? What was the movie about?
He is an average guy and he accidentally gets a call from a kidnapped lady, and it´s up to him to save her and her family.
Oh wow! That seems very heroic. Which other actors participate in the movie?
You´ll find Kim Basinger, William H. Macy, Jason Statham, Noah Emmerich, Jessica Biel among many.
Wow! Even Jessica Biel made an appearance, now I definitely have to see it.
Yes! I recommended it greatly.
You also mentioned this movie called Gifted, is this a new one?
You are right! It was launched on the movie theaters just about a month or two. I heard is really good. We should go see it together.
Sounds great! Will do!. Do you know what is it about though?
Yes is about a guy that adopts his niece, but she is very gifted, has a very high IQ, and there are people trying to take advantage of her.
