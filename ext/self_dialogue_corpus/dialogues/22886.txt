Who were the big winners at the 2017 Oscars?
Do you mean the Academy Awards?
There one and the same.
I know I was just messing with you. I think Moonlight won Best Picture.
I thought La La Land won
Oh geez, don't start this again.
Kidding. I know about the controversy.
Have you seen Moonlight?
Not yet, but it's in our Netflix queue
It's streaming on Netflix?
No, we still do the DVD plan. Much better library.
Oh wow, you and a select few.
Yeah, but we get a lot better selection vs streaming.
True
I think Fences was nominated for Best Picture as well
Which one was that?
The Denzel Washington one based on a play
Oh, I heard about it, but didn't see it.
Mixed reviews. I might pass.
Yeah, me too.
