I just took my son to see the latest Cars movie.
How was that?
It was good.  I love all of those animated movies!
I agree.  Even though I'm an adult, there is something about watching the animated movies with my kids that just makes me smile.
Which ones do you like best?
I love the Toy Story series.
Me too!  Which one was your favorite?
I loved Toy Story 3.  I cried at the end!
Oh me too!  My kids thought I was crazy!  I really like the older more classic Disney movies.
Oh yeah?  Like Cinderella?
Exactly.  I love Cinderella, Snow White, Bambi...
Don't even get me started on Bambi.  I cry every time!
Lion King always gets me choked up.
Definitely!  Which movies make you laugh?
I really like Monsters Inc.  That little girl cracks me up!
She sure is a cutie.  I liked the sequal to Monsters Inc where they go to college.
That was really cute.  Have you seen any of the minions movies?
I have.  They're cute, but not my favorite.
I agree.  They're okay, but I found them somewhat annoying.
I know, but my kids love them!
