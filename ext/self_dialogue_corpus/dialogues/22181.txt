Did you see any of the ”Hunger Games” movies?
Yes I saw them.
Which one was your favorite one?
I liked them all, but the last ones were pretty dark.
Did you read the books as well?
I read the books, how about you?
I loved the books, but I always liked the author, Suzanne Collins.
There were a few things that I didn’t like in the movie, compared to the books.
Like what?
The cats name was Buttercup, in the book she was a yellow cat.
Okay, I don’t remember the cat from the movie.
In the movie it was a black cat, I mean how hard could it have been to get a yellow or orange cat? A black cat shouldn’t be named Buttercup.
Before you saw the later movies or finished the books who did you think Katniss was going to end up with?
I thought it would be Peeta, though he was the wimpier choice.
I thought it would be him too.  There was so much they went through in the games together.
She did go through stuff with Gale though, real actual life stuff, like hunting and killing animals.
She was trying to survive from poverty and such with Gale, but they were trying to kill her with Peeta.
Did  you have another favorite character in the movie?
Haymitch was a cool character in general, and the acting was good.
I liked him as well, I think the actor did a good job.
