What do you think of this year's Miami Dolphins roster?
Their offensive line is stacked in my opinion.
What makes you think that?
Are you kidding?
I didn't see their draft. It must of been good to get this reaction.
Twenty six players on their roster got drafted in the first three rounds of the NFL draft.
Take me through a few players.
Ok lets take their quarterback for instance.
Ryan Tannehill?
Yes, He's the best quarterback they have had since Dan Marino retired.
Well he has shown a consistent level of improvement every year since he was drafted.
Exactly. He is on a very steady upswing and his performance really shows it.
Who else would you say on the roster is a stand out on the team?
I'd say their runing back is another stand out for me.
Jay Ajayi?
Yeah thats him! He established himself as a Top 10 RB in the NFL with three 200+ yard performances.
He was also in a pro bowl if I remember correctly.
Yes he was which just adds on to how good this guy is.
Do you expect them to do well this year?
Absolutely I'd be shocked if they didn't
