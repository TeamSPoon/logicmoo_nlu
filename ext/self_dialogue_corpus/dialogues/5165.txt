Hey you look like Elsa from Frozen in that blue dress!
Oh sure, I just need a long blonde braid.
So if you're Elsa, does that make me Olaf?
Oh no way! You're lots smarter than Olaf!
At least I'm trustworthy, so Hans.
Yeah Hans was a traitor!
Maybe I should go to the costume store and dress like Anna.
Oh sure. ' cause I've always wanted a sister!
So I guess that leaves us Sven?
Well he is the most cuddly character!
