I haven't heard a Shakira song in a long time.
Me either.
Her song Hips Don't Lie was such a big hit.
I know, and around the time it released her song with Beyonce came out.
Yep. What was it called again?
I think it was called Beautiful Liar.
That's right. I used to love that song.
Me too. I'll have to check out some of Shakira's newer music.
The last I knew she voiced a character in Zootopia.
Really?
Yeah. Unsurprisingly she played a singer.
That's funny, but now that I'm thinking about it.. didn't she sing a song for the Olympics pretty recently?
Oh, you might be right.
I know she received a lot of attention for her song for the 2010 World Cup.
Oh yeah. I forgot about her song Waka Waka.
She has such a unique voice.
I agree. She doesn't sound like anybody else.
She kind of looks like how Mariah Carey looked in the beginning of her career.
You're right. I think it's the wavy hair.
Yep, and now Mariah Carey's style is straight hair.
