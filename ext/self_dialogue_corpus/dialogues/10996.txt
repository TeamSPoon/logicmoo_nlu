Where is the draft being held this year?
I have no clue.
Guess it doesnt matter.
Its a 2 player draft anyway.
Yeah who do you think is going first?
No clue, either do the Devils.
Kinda bizarre we dont know just yet.
I think you cant go wrong with either.
Will either play this year?
They both will contribute right away.
Oh ok, thats cool.
Yeah I think draft picks dont need to marinate in the AHL for too long anymore.
When did that start?
No idea when, just know thats how it is.
Gotcha. Does Vegas have the first pick?
No the Devils do.
Wow, cant believe they didnt go with an expansion team.
I guess in the spirit of the lottery.
When do the Flyers pick?
Number 2.
