Watched anything good lately?
I saw that movie 'Get Out', actually.
Oh I heard awesome things about that!
Yeah it was really great. Better than I expected.
Did Jordan Peel write it?
Yes, and direct it. It was only kinda funny though, but it wasn't supposed to be a comedy.
I've only heard good things about it. I love the sketch show.
It's written just as well. Really smart writing.
Is it scary?
Kind of - it's more jumpy than scary.
I missed it in the cinema, I'll have to watch it on DVD.
That's a shame - I'm really glad I saw it in the cinema.
Was it more scary?
That, and the kind of shared tension in the room, y'know.
Oh yeah, that always adds to the effect. I saw The Blair Witch Project in cinemas.
I bet that was freaky!
Yes! I wasn't even that scared, but because it was in the dark...
I wouldn't want to watch it by myself, that's for sure.
Oh definitely. I haven't watched it since then. Freaked me out too much.
That movie freaked me out, too.
