What's your favorite pop radio station?
I like Kiss FM. They play all the hits from today's pop music.
What's the most played artist on their station?
They play a lot of Bruno Mars, Taylor Swift, Justin Bieber...
Have you heard Justin Bieber's new featured song Despacito?
Yes! I have. It's great. I can't believe there's a song in Spanish on the radio and it's a hit.
Do you understand any of the lyrics?
No, I don't speak Spanish... but I've listened to Daddy Yankee before.
Daddy Yankee? Didn't he sing that song called Gasolina?
Yeah that's a popular reggaeton song.
