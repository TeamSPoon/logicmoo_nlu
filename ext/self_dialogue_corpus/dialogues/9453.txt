do you like mumble rap?
why would i like that?
they are unique. hip hop is at its punk phase
Its not like punk.
its opening the doors and doing new things.
its not speaking on anything important though.
its more about having fun i suppose.
its not very political.its just stupid
well, its good music to bump to in the case.
maybe
