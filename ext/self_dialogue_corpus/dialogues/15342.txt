Do you like electronic music at all?
I like some of it. It really depends on what it sounds like.
What kind of music do you normally listen to?
I like funk or disco music. I have a wide variety of tastes, though.
If you like funk and disco stuff you should check out Snake Hips.
I've never heard of them.
It's like electronically replaced disco and dance music.
That sounds like a lot of fun.
It is. It's hard to not start dancing.
That's the main reason I love those types of music. It makes you want to dance.
Definitely. I  would categorize funk as one of the funnest types of music.
Do they have a specific song or CD I could check out?
They have a song called "Forever (pt.2)" that you should check out.
I definitely will. I love finding new music.
Another good artist that is similar is Griz.
I have heard of Griz. He's great.
He actually plays the saxophone at his live shows.
Wow! Really?
Yes, I would say he's one of the funnest DJ's to see live.
That just makes me like his music twice as much!
