Have you heard the new album from the Weeknd?
No but I have heard of couple of his singles on the radio.
You should listen to it, it's really well done.
It seems like he is very talented.
He really is and I think he is underrated.
It doesn't help that the radio burns you out on songs.
Yeah for sure, I heard I Can't Feel My Face probably 1000 times when it came out.
Yes! I really didn't like that song either.
I thought it was probably the worst song on that album.
Makes you wonder why they chose it for a single.
Probably because it was catchy and poppy.
I guess. It did get stuck in your head!
His new album is more musical.
That one new song reminds me of Michael Jackson.
Oh! The song I Feel It Coming?
Yes! That one. I really like his voice there.
That's how most of the new album sounds.
Well I'm a huge fan of Michael so maybe I'll give it a try.
You really should, I think you'd like it!
Well if you don't mind, I'd like to borrow it.
