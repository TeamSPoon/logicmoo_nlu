Did you know that the Beatles now have their own channel on Sirius XM?
I did not, but I will listen because I love their music.
What song of the Beatles do you like best?
I like "I Want to Hold Your Hand".
Which Beatle do you think had the most success?
I think John Lennon would have if he had lived as long as Paul McCartney.
John Lennon gained a whole new generation with the song "Imagine".
I agree. it was very sad about his death.
What do you think about The Rolling Stones?
I think they had fame with "Paint It Black".
That song is still popular at college parties.
I also here "Emotional Rescue" quite a bit.
Didn't you do a report on Elvis in Music History class?
I did. i felt that the song "Hound Dog" set the stage for his unique Rock and Roll sound.
"I Can't Help Falling in Love" has had so many cool versions made of it.
Elvis' songs will live on forever.
My father likes the 50s sounds in music he grew up with.
Didn't you say his best memory was of "Peanut Butter" by The Marathons?
He would play that song every afternoon when we were in preschool.
I remember him playing "Sherry" by The 4 Seasons when we were over for dinner last month.
