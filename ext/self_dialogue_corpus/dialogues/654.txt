I was reading about the top draft pick for the 2018 NFL draft.
Who's the top pick?
Sam Darnold, a QB from USC. He threw 31 touchdowns last season.
Sounds like he has quite an arm.
He completed 67% of his throws, so he's pretty good.
So he's the top pick, huh?
Maybe not. The article said he might play a couple more seasons at USC.
He's going to wait for the 2019 season?
He still has time to decide, but several people close to him have said he might want to play with USC a couple more seasons.
It makes sense, if you are doing well on a team, you want to keep that up.
Yeah, but if he gets hurt it could stop his chances from the big leagues.
I'm sure his team is going to try and protect such a valuable player.
It depends on how well he plays this season. If he does well and is the number one pick, that would be hard to pass up.
How many yards did he throw last season?
Over 3,000. So all eyes are going to be on him this season.
Especially the scouts. That's a lot of pressure on Darnold.
Yeah, but it's a good pressure to see how well he'd do in the NFL.
They can always use a good quarterback in the NFL.
Yeah, especially since some of the QB's are getting older and probably going to be retiring.
Somehow, I see Tom Brady playing with grey hair and never retiring.
