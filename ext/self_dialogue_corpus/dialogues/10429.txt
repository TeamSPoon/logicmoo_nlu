Guess what movie I saw yesterday?
Logan.
That's right. How did you know?
You've only been talking about it for the last month.
It was fantastic!  There was this great scene....
Save it. I'm not interested.
What!? Why not?
I don't like superhero movies.
Logan isn't a superhero. Well, not exactly. He's....
I don't care. I don't like those type of movies.
Well, ok.  What do you like?
I like movies about situations I can relate to, with regular people who aren't waving guns around and bulging with muscles but yet they never eat or if they do they only eat salads.
You mean like regular dumb farts who eat Pop-Tarts for breakfast?
Exactly.
So you must have liked Ordinary People?
Oh, that was superb. Especially the part where Mary Tyler Moore got naked.
Wait, what!?  I don't remember that.
Oh, you missed an eyeful buddy. She was a knockout.
I gotta check Netflix. I mean, right now.
Relax--it's in my list.
