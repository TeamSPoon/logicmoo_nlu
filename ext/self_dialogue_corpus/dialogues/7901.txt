So what do you think about pop music today?
I don't think it has ever been better, so many great artists.
Who are some of your favorites?
I really like Rihanna and Katy Perry.
I love both of them too. They each have so many catchy songs.
They really do. I've been listening to a lot of Rihanna's older songs.
That's cool, which ones?
Songs like umbrella and disturbia.
Nice, I think her songs have aged well.
Me too, looking forward to her new stuff too.
