What is your favorite movie?
Wow, that's a tough question.
Why is it so tough?
Because there are so many good movies.
Well, what's your favorite comedy movie?
I would say Half-Baked?
The Dave Chappelle stoner movie?
Yeah it cracks me up.
I didn't think that would be one of your favorite movies.
Why is that?
I didn't think you liked stoner comedy.
I found that movie funny.
Well, what is your favorite action movie?
I have to go old school and say Terminator 2.
That movie was ahead of it's time.
The CGI used in it still holds up today.
They had a great bad guy.
I love when he turns to a liquid and walks through the iron bars.
Sarah Conner was also a beast for a female character.
She was on the strongest women I've ever seen in a movie.
