Who is your favorite new orleans artist to see live?
Oh, there are so many good ones!
I know it's a hard question. there are so many genres too.
I like Kermit Ruffins.
Yeah he really captures the spirit of the city.
The Essentials are fun.
I like them and Tank and the Bangas
Mmhmm. Lots of good female singers.
Have you heard Kelcy Mae?
Her songwriting is good but she's boring to watch.
I miss Hurray for the riff raff being around town
For sure. they were always a good show.
Andrew Duhon is similiar to Kelcy Mae
Writes good songs but is boring as hell to watch?
Exactly.
The Soul Rebels are super fun to watch
DJ Matty is good
Not as good as DJ Soul Sister
Well no one is as good as her
True. I'm sad she doesn't spin on saturdays anymore
