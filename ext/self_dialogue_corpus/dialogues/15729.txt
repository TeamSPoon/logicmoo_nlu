What are you listening too?
At the moment Haim.
Isn't that the band with the 3 sisters?
Yes it is.
How are they?
Really good, takes me back to the 80's a bit.
So are they like a pop group, like a girl version of the Backstreet Boys?
No, not at all. They're poppy but they they make all of their music.
So they play instruments?
Yes, all of them and they're all great singers as well.
Who would you compare them too?
That's hard to say. Some songs sound like you're listening to old school Wilson Philips and others make you think of Pat Benatar.
I love me some Pat Benatar.
Who doesn't, but Haim pretty much stands on their own. Not too many bands like them these days.
What songs should I check out?
The Wire is really good from their first album.
How many albums do they have?
Just one studio album right now but their new one comes out in July.
I might give them a listen sometime.
You should, it's great feel good music.
