I don't know about the latest game.
With who?
Celtics.
What about them?
You can tell they're losing their touch.
Because of the brain drain?
No, defense.
Their playbook.
Yeah.
They've got a weird playbook.
They don't know what they're doing.
They have weird ideas.
Definitely.
They always try dumb plays.
Oh, god, yeah.
They love to do that.
I don't like them.
They're interesting.
Are they?
They always do something different.
