I was flipping through channels last night and found the movie The Rock.
What is that one?
A great action movie with Nick Cage and Sean Connery.
I remember that one.
Good movie. I ended up watching it again.
Sean Connery is such a great actor.
Ed Harris isn't bad, but seems he's always a bad guy.
He does. He does do a lot of good action movies.
Yes, but Nick Cage is better in movies.
I have to agree.
