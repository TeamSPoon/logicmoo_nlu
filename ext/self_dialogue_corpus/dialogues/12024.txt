Who is your favorite character in the Star Wars series?
My favorite character is Han Solo.
I can understand that. It's pretty amazing all of the stuff he gets away with in the Millennium Falcon.
I am really glad that Luke turned out to be Leia's brother so that she could end up with Han instead.
It's kind of strange that his best friend is Chewbaka.
I'm not really sure how Han and Chewy carry on conversations, but I think they are cute together.
I'm so glad that Harrison Ford has lived long enough to continue to play Han Solo in the newer movies.
I completely agree. I will be so upset when he dies. I cried and screamed in the theater when Han was killed.
It's pretty terrible that his son, Kylo Ren killed him like that.
It was absolutely horrible! I hope Kylo Ren gets what is coming to him in the next movie. He needs to be punished!
