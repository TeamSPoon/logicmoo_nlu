Did you hear that they're making another Beteguise?
No. When's that happening?
Not sure. It just shows on IMDB as "announced".
Well I hope they are.
Me too. I just love Tim Burton.
What about Michale Keaton?
Oh yeah, soooo good!
I wonder why they're doing it now.
I know. Its been like 30 years.
Yeah, Michael Keaton will fit the part even better!
All old and decrepit!
Ha!
Well I'll be looking forward to that coming out.
I'll let you know if I hear anything else.
Please do.
Maybe we could catch it together.
Yeah that'd be good.
What's it called?
Betleguise 2, I think.
Cool. I'm gonna look it up.
