So have you seen all the Fast & Furious movies?
I believe so, they're all so great
but which one is your favorite?
if you have to choose, it's gonna be the one that involves cars jumping over a drawbridge, I don't remember which one that was
sounds like the second one when Paul Walker was an under cover FBI agent
yea that's the one, god I miss Paul Walker already
yea me as a fan of the series as well, it's so sad to see Paul Walker gone, at such young age
you know there was a song dedicated to him, "see you again"?
oh yeah, How could I miss that song, I heard it has 28 million views on Youtube already?
yeah, it's crazy, but Paul deserved it
