Have you seen the new Guardians of the Galaxy movie yet?
No, I haven't. Is it worth it?
It's totally worth it. Go!
I really liked the first one. you know how sequels can be.
Personally, I think the sequel is better than the original.
But, Groot! I will miss Groot! He was the best part of the first movie.
I love Groot too. And, trust me, he lives on in baby Groot.
Excellent. What did you like about it so much?
You will laugh until tears stream down your face and you will cry heart wrenching tears as well.
So, it hits the full range of emotions. Sounds like I will like it.
