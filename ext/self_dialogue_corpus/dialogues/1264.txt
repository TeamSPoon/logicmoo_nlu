What happened to the Bengals last year?
Half of their receivers left. AJ Green was hurt most of the year.
Really shows you what kind of impact big playmakers have on success.
Most definitely, big play ability is what makes most good teams good.
Is Dalton the future?
I don't know. I am starting to have doubts.
What about McCarron?
He's a good game manager but without multiple big time weapons around him I don't see him producing big numbers.
The defense is almost good enough to make up for that though.
Almost is not good enough.
Yeah,  you're right.
And Burfict and Jones miss a few games a year because of this malfeasance or that.
Why can't the Bengals get that squashed?
I have no idea bro.. But it's every single year and it's frustrating.
With a basically healthy and full defensive roster for an entire season could they get it done?
With some of the new draft additions and a healthy tight end position I say yes.
It's tough to be a Bengals fan when they are in the playoffs most years but can't win a playoff game.
Yup, the wildcard game against Pittsburgh two years ago about ended my fandom.
I feel ya', and it was Burfict and Jones.
If the Who Deys could clean it up just a little more they would achieve playoff success.
