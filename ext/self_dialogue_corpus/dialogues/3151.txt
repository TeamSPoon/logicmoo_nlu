Do you know where they are gonna have next super bowl at?
I have no clue. Not like my team is gonna be there...
Who's your team?
Miami dolphins. They aren't so hot.
They aren't that bad either. Besides things can change with the draft...
Yeah, I know, but they haven't been good for some years now.
Well, I'm still a Giants fan and I really am rooting for them.
You know, they may have a chance though.
I hope so. Another team I like is the Titans. I used to live in Nashville.
Oh, they surprised us last season! They were good!
Yeah, I love it when a young team like that do so well.
I know, they are kind of an under dog.
Mariota is pretty impressive.
Is he recovered from his leg injury?
Oh, I forgot about that. I would think so. He had a lot of time to recover...
...and he is young and healthy.
Exactly. I have high hopes for them.
Better than the Dolphins? haha...
Better than the Browns, Duh!
That's mean! Hahaha, but so true!
