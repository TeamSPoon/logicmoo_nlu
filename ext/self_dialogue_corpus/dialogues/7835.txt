Last Sunday I have seen one of the Harry Potter movies.
Good. Which part of Harry Potter movies?
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows part 2 which was released on 2011.
I too like that movie. How did you feel?
Enjoyed very much. I am a huge fan of Harry Potter movies.
Harry, Hermione and Ron are grown up in this movie. And Hermoine looking too cute in this movie.
Exactly. I very much like these three characters.
After seven earlier films reaching back a decade, the Harry Potter saga comes to a solid and satisfying conclusion.
What I can observe is that this final film is a reunion of sorts for a great many characters we've come to know over the years.
Harry Potter is the ever green wonderful movie.
