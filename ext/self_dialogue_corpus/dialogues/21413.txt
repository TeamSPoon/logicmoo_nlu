So I have an assignment for my history class that I am hoping you can help with.
What is that?
I have to pick out a movie that represents or is based on a historical event and write about it. What are the best movies like that you know of?
Well, what time period of movie are you looking for?
Maybe something set in the first half of the 20th century.
Okay, well a few come to mind. What about Pearl Harbor?
Is that the one with Josh Hartnett?
Yes, it is a pretty good film.
I agree, but there is a little bit too much love story in it for me.
Okay, well how about Tora Tora Tora?
What is that one about?
It is also about Pearl Harbor and the events leading up to it.
Is there a lot of love story in it?
No, it pretty much just sticks to the historical aspects of it.
How old is the movie?
It was made in 1970, but it is a good one.
Oh, I am not saying an old one cannot be. I love old movies.
I think some of the best movies are "old".
Well, I will give Tora Tora Tora a try then. Thanks.
No problem, I hope you enjoy the movie.
