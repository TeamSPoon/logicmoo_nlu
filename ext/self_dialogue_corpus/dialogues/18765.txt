Have you heard that Stevie Nicks is going on tour with Fleetwood Mac?
I heard that yesterday and was so excited.
Have you seen the tour schedule yet?
No, but I know you can tell me if they'll be playing.
So far there are no concerts scheduled in Arizona.
How about in the L.A. area?
Of course they're playing in L.A!
When is the concert?
July 16th-You could take me for my birthday.
Is it just Stevie Nicks with Fleetwood Mac?
There's actually a weekend of Classic Concerts-the  16th also has Journey and Fleetwood Mac.
Who else is performing that weekend?
The Eagles, Steely Dan and the Doobie Brothers.
We have to go, how much are the tickets?
Anywhere from 150 to 2500 dollars, depending upon seats, perk, 1 or 2 concerts.
We can't miss these concerts, they will never happen again!
I know and they're in Dodger Stadium so if we want to be close enough to see, we'll have to get a good package.
That's true, I don't want to watch them on the Jumbotron
Let's check out the packages and decide today before it's too late.
It's a deal and I hope they take credit cards.
