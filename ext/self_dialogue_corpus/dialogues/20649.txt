Did you ever see the movie the Sandlot?
Yea that was a true summer time classic!
It came out in  1993.
Yea my kids watched it all the time in the summer.
Mine too!
Those kids really had some amusing adventures.
Remember the dog in the backyard  behind the fence?
Yea I do.
Who was in that anyway?
Well, Tom Guiry played Scotty Smalls.
Yea he was the new kid that moved to the neighborhood.
Yea and the dog was named Beast.
One of the balls that went over the fence was signed by Babe Ruth.
Yup.
It has become a cult film.
I know that and Stand by me.
Another great movie of the 1990's.
Boy those were the days.
Yea sitting home in the summer , watching movies, too young to work.
Ahhhh, sweet summer!
