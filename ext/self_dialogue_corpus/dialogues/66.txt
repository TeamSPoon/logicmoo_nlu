I think Bale should reprise his Batman
It was good but I dont know if it was that god
They way he interacted with the Joker
I think that was more about Ledger's performance
He was even great with Bane.
No not so much he was barely in it
I agree that the dialogue was lower
And it was Bane's movie
There was not alot of action in the film
Yeah and that is what brought that below the first in my rankings for the newer Batman movies.
