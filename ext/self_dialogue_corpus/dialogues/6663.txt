DID YOU SEE THE NEW DISNEY ANIMATED MOVIE MOANA?
YES! I LOVED IT!
MOANA'S SINGING WAS SO BEAUTIFUL!
I LOVED HER SONG "HOW FAR I'LL GO"
YES, WHEN SHE SANG IT AT THE GRAMMY'S IT WAS A HIT.
I ALSO LOVED THE ROCK AS THE CHARACTER MAUI WAS GOOD CASTING.
I LIKED THE LITTLE ANIMAL CHARACTERS TOO!
THE CHICKEN AND THE PIG WE'RE REALLY CUTE.
IT ALSO HAD A GOOD MESSAGE.
YES, IT SHOWED THEY HAD BRAVERY. THE COCONUTS WERE ALSO VERY FUNNY!
