You a fan of Muse?
Yea, they're pretty great!
Ever see them live?
Yea, a few times.
They put on a great show, huh?
Their stage setups are pretty amazing.
I know, right? I've seen them in small and large venues and they always have cool effects.
When's the last time you saw them?
At an amphitheater. The show was delayed an hour starting because it rained like crazy and there was lightning.
Wow, that's wild! Still a good show though?
Oh, absolutely. When they finally came on, they rocked it! Played past midnight.
Wow, sounds like a great show.
Yea, I'm hoping they tour again after the new album is ready.
When's it supposed to come out?
In the Fall, I think? They played one song from it at the show I attended.
What was it called?
"Dig Down", it was pretty good!
Cool, I wonder if it's on YouTube or anything?
I think so, I read the other day that they dropped a video for it already.
Awesome, I'll check it out!
