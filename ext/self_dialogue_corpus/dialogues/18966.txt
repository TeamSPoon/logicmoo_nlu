When did you start listening to the Beatles?
I think I was in junior high school.
Did your parents have records or tapes of them?
No, there was an oldies station in the area where I lived.  They would play a syndicated Beatles show every week and I would listen to it faithfully.
Wow, you were really dedicated.
I was.  In fact, sometimes I would tape the show so that I had some of the songs.
You had a tape cassette in your radio?
Yup.  Remember those?
People say that tapes are coming back.  And so are mix tapes.
Oh, I loved making mix tapes.
I wonder if the movie Guardians of the Galaxy played a role in making mix tapes popular.
I don't know.  But making mix tapes are fun because you can also add your own vocalizations much more easily than with a CD.
I don't even have any burnable CDs anymore.  I mainly listen to music on my phone.
Do you think that impacts the quality of the music?
People say it does, but I think they just say that to sound discerning.
I wonder if it makes a difference the type of music you listen to.
What do you mean?
Well now, there is so much synthesized sound vs real instruments I doubt that it would make a difference.
People also say that the headphones you use makes a difference too.
Yeah, the people who sell the headphones.
