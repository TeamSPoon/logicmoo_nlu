Bases have been weird this season.
They've been gross.
Lots of stealing.
Did you see the game with Boston?
What about it?
They killed all game.
Like, stealing?
It was extremely disrespectful.
How many?
20.
What?
Seriously.
Who does that.
I know.
That's nuts.
Boston is nuts.
God, I love Boston.
I know.
Insane players.
Absolutely.
