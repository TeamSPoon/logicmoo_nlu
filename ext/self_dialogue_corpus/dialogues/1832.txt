I am excited abou the upcoming NFL season.
I am too, it should be starting soon.
Yes, pre-season games will start next month!
Who is your favorite team?
My favorite NFL team is the Saints.
What city is the Saints in?
The Saints are in New Orleans.
How did they do last year.
The saints had a good season, but not like the one in 2009.
What was special about that season?
The City of New Orleans was still recovering from the massive huricane that hit in 2005.
What did the Saints do that year?
The Saints had a winning season and ended up going to the super bowl to play the great Peyton Manning.
Who won the super bowl in 2010.
In 2010, the Saints defeated Peyton Manning and the Colts easily to win their first ever super bowl title!
I bet the city was happy about that.
Yes, there were celebrations everywhere and Drew Brees became a household name.
Is Brees still the quarterback for the saints?
Drew Brees is currently their quaterback and has passed for more 5000 yard season than any other quaterback has in the NFL.
Wow, I can't wait to see what Brees and the saints can do this season.
