So have your kids finally gotten that "Frozen" song out of their heads.
Yeah, finally, but now they're singing that one from "Moana."
Oh?
Yeah, it can be a bit much.
Ha ha ha, which song.
Really?
What are you going to make me guess?
Now, I've got the lyrics stuck in my head.
You're welcome.
NOT FUNNY!
Yeah, you're laughing on the inside, and you know it.
Whatever.
Well, we could start singing that old favorite from Frozen.
Don't you dare.
You should learn to lighten up.
You are despicable.
Maybe you should just let it go.
I hate you.
No, you don't.
Whatever.
