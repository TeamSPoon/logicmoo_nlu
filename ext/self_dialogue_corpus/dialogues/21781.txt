hey Fred guess what?
what's it?
come make a wild guess lol
you know am not not good at guessing, what's it?lol
i just got selected as an extra in a new movie from paramount pictures starring bradley cooper as the lead actor.
wow when did this happen?
just got the email couple of minutes lol
damn that's nice you hedging your way to your quest to be an actor,you can start networking especially with cooper if possible.
of course i am so looking forward to meet him.
please let me not be too over myself isn't cooper same guy that acted "american hustle" ?
yes he was on american hustle but wasnt really the lead actor, hangover was his biggest movie so far.
oyeah i knew him from hangover as well, he did brilliantly.
oh sure cooper is a good actor and now that he has relocated to the USA  you bet he would be getting more lead role like this one i am featuring as an extra.
what's the name of the movie?
which?
the one you got invited to take part as an extra.
oh its called "Goons of a mafia"
hmm nice movie tittle, wonder what the storyline is about.
i haven't got any idea about the story line as of yet, shooting starts nextweek so be sure i would be updating on the spot hahahah
oyeah can't wait to see you on the big screen when it is released.
