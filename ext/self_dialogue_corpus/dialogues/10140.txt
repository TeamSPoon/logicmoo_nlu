Did you enjoy American Sniper?
Yes, that is one of my favorite action movies.
It had a lot of good drama, but the action scenes were very realistic.
I agree and the acting was top notch.
Clint Eastwood is a serious director.
He has done alot of good work for many years.
I was surprised at how big Bradley Cooper got for that role.
He must have trained a few hours a day to get in that kind of shape.
He is a really good actor.
Yeah, Clint knows how to cast a film.
