what kind of music do you listen to?
right now im really digging break beats.
what is break beats?
its a sub genre of techno.
what makes it different than other techno.
its kind of hard to explain.
give it a shot.
well the music builds up till there is a "break".
what do you mean a "break"?
like the pace of the music keeps getting faster and more intense until it reaches its max and "breaks".
so its kind of like sex?
yeah, i guess you could put it that way.
it sounds interesting.
really, break beat is the perfect music to have sex to.
is break beats what break dancers dance to?
yeah, a lot of times.
break beats were very popular back in the rave days.
i guess i'm too young to understand.
