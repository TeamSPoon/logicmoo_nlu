Do you like Red Dirt country music?
I don't know what that is. What kind of country is it?
It's a type of country music that comes out of Texas and Oklahoma.
That sounds interesting, why is it different than regular country?
It is specially non-Nashville, and it embraces the down home roots of country music. It doesn't really have any pop elements in it.
Why did it begin?
Red Dirt began because of a distaste for Nashville country, and because certain country artists felt they were being shut out of the Nashville music scene. A lot of the songs in red dirt reflect that sentiment.
So do all of the bands and musicians come from Texas or Oklahoma?
I think originally, yes, but today many artists do not.
What are some examples of Red Dirt artists?
Jason Boland and the Stragglers, Robert Earl Keen, Waylon Jennings, Willie Nelson, and others.
What is the difference between "outlaw" country and "red dirt" country?
Well, there aren't many outlaw country artists left, I believe. However, there is a lot of overlap between artists who were "outlaw," or outside of the Nashville music scene and red dirt artists.
What is the sound like?
Red dirt sounds more like bluegrass, rock, Western swing, honky tonk, even Mexican influences. I think most of the country music coming out of Nashville has undeniable pop overtones.
When did this begin?
It began in the 1970s, and really grew to apex around the early 2000s. However, many people today would say that the gap in the types of music are closing.
If they don't go to Nashville, how to these artists get their start?
The musicians tour various honky tonks, dance halls, fraternity parties, wherever they can get a gig.
That sounds so good and interesting! I will certainly check it out!
