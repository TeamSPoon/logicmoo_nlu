What's your view on the new Wonder Woman movie ?
I am fairly pumped for it.
Do you think it will be a good one ?
I think it has potential
I like her in the Batman and supernan film.
She has a real presence.
I think it will go over well in her solo film.
It will for sure have a lot of action
Don't D.C. Movies always have action
I'm sure this film will double up on action
Why would they do that ?
Since it's a gamble film. Wonder Woman is a well known, but never had her own movie
I get it. Needs a lot of D.C. Action cred
Exactly. Their movies are so much just non stop action ad power , I'm sure this one will be even bigger in that
I kind of hope so. I like the whole strong superhero, female superhero
It seems like that is something we will see more of in films
I think the Wonder Woman film is the perfect catalyst for it
The movie should have a lot of power, but also a softer side I bet
Wonder Woman movies could never be soft.
So maybe no Wonder Woman romance film ?
