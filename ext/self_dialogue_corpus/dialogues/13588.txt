What do you think of the latest Star Wars Movie?
I really liked it, how do you think the next one will be?
Well I really hope it turns out better.
Yea me too.
Personally I thought the last one that came out was a little week.
Why do you think that?
Because they didn't really explain things all that well.
Isn't that what they're suppose to do? Make you wonder?
Yea, but I would have liked to have seen a bit more than what the ending gave.
Yea that would have been nice.
