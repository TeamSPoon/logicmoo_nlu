Thank you Lord it's almost football season again.
Oh cmon the MLB Allstar game is tonight!
Baseball is too slow, I want action!
How are your Chiefs going to do this year?
I don't know.
What? You always say this is their year.
I know but Alex Smith keeps letting me down, and don't get me started on Reed.
Andy Reed? The coach.
Yeah. He's a horrible time manager.
But put together a great team.
But he chokes at crunch time
Maybe this year will be differant
Maybe monkeys will fly out my butt.
As long as they beat the Raiders.
As long as everybody beats the raiders
You think the rivalry will still be there after the move
Sure.... the raiders will always suck
What are you lookin forward to the most on opening day?
Barbecued lil smokies and beer.
Me too man, me too.
