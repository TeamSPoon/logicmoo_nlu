Do you know of any good movies to watch?
What kind do you like?
I like almost all genres, but I'm really feeling a romantic comedy right now
Have you seen "Me Before You"?
I don't think so...
It has that blonde chic from Game of Thrones in it
Oh I love her!
Me too! I read the book a couple years ago and I'm not a big book-to-movie fan, but they did a really good job on this one!
What is it about?
It's about an adventurous guy who gets into an accident and becomes a paraplegic. His parents hire someone to take care of him and it ends up being a romantic comedy, with a twist at the end.
Twist?!
Yeah, but I'm not going to tell you because I don't want to ruin it.
Ugh, okay. But it's a romantic comedy?
Yep, just what you're looking for.
Who else is in it?
Emilia Clarke is the Game of Thrones girl, and Sam Claflin is the other big star. He played in "Love, Rosie" another book-to-movie that is great!
I think I remember him!
Yeah so definitely check it out and let me know how you like it!
Would you be up for watching it with me?
of course!
