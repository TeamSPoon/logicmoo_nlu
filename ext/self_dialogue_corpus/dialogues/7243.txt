If you were one of the seven dwarfs, which one would you be?
Do you mean like from Snow White?
Yes! I think I would be sleepy.
I am a little sleepy right now, but I think I would be happy.
I might even be sneezy with all of the allergies I have been experiencing.
No kidding! I am definitely sneezy this time of year.
Snow White was always my favorite Disney princess. I think she is so beautiful.
I really like Snow White as well. I think she has a beautiful voice.
She definitely has an amazing voice. I always wished I could sing like her.
So did I, I wanted to be just like her when I grew up.
