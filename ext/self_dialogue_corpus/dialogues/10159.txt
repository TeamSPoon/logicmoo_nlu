What do you think is the best action film in the last five years?
That is a hard one. Maybe something like, Edge of Tommorow.
With the aliens and the big guns, very suspenseful and lots of action.
I liked the way the plot played with time too.
Oh yes, they died so many times it was crazy.
I like that one and Snowpiercer.
I have never seen that one.
It has Chris Evans in it, it is not a really popular one.
Is it a super hero one?
No, he is on a train going no where and there is just a lot of action. He ends up dying in the end.
