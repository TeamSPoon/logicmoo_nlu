Do you think that Kirk Cousins will sign a long term contract this year with the Redskins?
Maybe or maybe not. The Redskins should certainly pay him
The past two years Cousins has been one of the best quarterbacks in the NFC
He has set all kinds of Redskins passing records
How much do you think that he will get paid if he signs?
I am sure it will be near $30 million a year
He is set to make like $27 million this year for being franchised
He is the first one to get the tender in consecutive years
It will be crazy if he gets its a third year in a row
It would be crazy
I forget, what college did he go to?
He went to Michigan State
That's right. He was a rookie the same year as RG3
Griffin was drafted with the second pick overall. Cousins was drafted in the fourth round
It was certainly a wise fourth round pick looking back on it.
Yes. Cousins took over for Griffin numerous times especially that first season
When did Cousins make his first start for the Redskins?
That first year against the Browns. RG3 missed that one game after injuring his knee the first time.
What game did RG3 hurt his knee against for Cousins to start the next week.
Ravens. Haloti Ngata hit him. Cousins came in that game and brought the team back to win against the Ravens. He started and won that next week against the Browns.
