Hi.
Hello.
How are you today?
Doing well and yourself?
Not too bad.
Good good.  Do you like music?
Yeah sure who doesn't.
I don't know I'm sure there are some people out there that don't.
Really, never met one.
I'm sure there are people out there that like talk radio, or podcasts, or something like that.
I guess.
What kind of music do you like?
I like Reggae, rap, r&b.
Okay cool.  Who is your favorite Reggae group or artist?
Well of course there is Bob Marley.
Anybody else?
Peter Tosh.
Don't know much about Reggae myself.
I love it.
I should listen to more of it.
