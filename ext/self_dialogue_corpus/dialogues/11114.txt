I wish I had more money so I could be more fashionable.
I don't think you need money to be fashionable.
Really? But all the best brands cost so much!
Yeah, but haven't you seen people combine cheap clothes in interesting ways before?
Yeah, but -
And there are people who actually alter their own clothes. And even make their own from scratch.
I can't do that.
Well, have you ever tried?
No, I guess not. And if nothing else, I can try to do more with what I have.
That's the spirit!
But do you think I can ever look fashionable considering I'm a little overweight?
Of course! Anyone of any race, gender, weight, whatever can be fashionable if they have confidence in what thy're wearing and choose interesting outfits.
Do you really think so?
Definitely. And there's no one type of fashion.
What do you mean?
Everyone has different ideas about what's fashionable.
But aren't some people right and some people wrong?
Not necessarily. Think about Project Runway. Sometimes the judges legitimately disagree.
Oh, you're right.
I think what matters most is that YOU like what you wear.
