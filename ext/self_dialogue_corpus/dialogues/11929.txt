Is it true the Beatles had their own cartoon series?
Yes it is and it came on on Saturdays.
Did they use real Beatle music in the show?
Yes the cartoon series included most of their biggest hits.
I bet lunch boxes, tee shirts and other Beatle merchandise is still collectible today.
It is and if you check on the bidding auction sites you'll some of it being worth quite a bit.
I have a double cd collection of Beatle hits. You think it may be worth something?
I am sure it is but Beatles old original Lps are probably worth twice as much as the cds.
Did Paul McCarthy start another group after the Beatles group broke up?
Yes Sir Paul McCarthy did but I am not sure of the name.
