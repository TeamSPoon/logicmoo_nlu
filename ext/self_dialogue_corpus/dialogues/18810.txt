What do you think of Eminems new music?
Its not nearly as good as his older music.
I agree. I dont like how fast he raps now.
I know! I wonder why he does that.
People say its because hes sober now.
I've heard that, too. Thats good, though.
Yeah, I do miss how he rapped back then, though.
Well, he's still selling millions of records every time he releases one. How did you like MMLP2?
It had like 4 good songs. I didnt like it much at all.
Which was your favorite
Ironically, Rap God. Even though thats when he raps the fastest.
That was great, yeah.
What do you think his best album is?
I love The Eminem Show.
Thats one of the best. My favorite is the first MMLP.
That's a classic.
He's been hinting at a new album on Twitter.
Really?! How so?
Hes been tweeting about his old albums, releasing stuff and there have been rumors.
I hope its this year.
