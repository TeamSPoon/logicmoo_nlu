Hey are you going to be watching NFL this season?
Yeah, of course I have to see if the Raiders live up to the hype.
What hype do you mean?
Well, I'll be interested to watch Amari Cooper this season.
Even though the team is moving to Las Vegas?
Yeah, even so. I'll still be watching.
Why is that?
Well, they'll be wanting to move on a hot streak so it's important to see that they do.
What do you think about their quarterback?
Oh, I think Dereck Carr will be phenomenal this year.
Do you see anybody exemplary in the backfield?
Yeah I see a few players.
And who might they be?
Khalil Mack for one.
So you're just banking that the lineup they had last year pulls through?
Not just banking on it, counting on it.
I don't see how such a prediction can be made.
Well, without any injuries this season I think they'll be well-placed to make the playoffs.
And what about the fans in Oakland?
They'll have to get used to seeing the Raiders succeed on their way out.
