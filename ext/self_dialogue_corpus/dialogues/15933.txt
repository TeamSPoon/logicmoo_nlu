Do you enjoy opera music?
Sometimes I listen to opera and classical.
Have you heard of Sarah Brightman?
Yes! She is amazing! Phantom of the Opera is awesome!
Yes! I love it too. She was married to Andrew Lloyd Webber who wrote Phantom of the Opera.
I didn't know they were married.
Yeah. I love when she sings the Phantom of the Opera song.
Me too!
I have her Symphony album.
You do? I have heard some of the songs.
The song called "Let it rain" is my favorite.
I really like that song too.
I have the "La Luna" album too.
I would really like to borrow them.
Of course!
Her "Eden" album is th best.
I really like that one. The "Dust in the wind" song has strong meaning.
Yes. I love that song. You can borrow that one too!
Thank you!
No problem.
