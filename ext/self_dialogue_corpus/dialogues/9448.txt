Do you have a favorite artist on the G.O.O.D. Music imprint?
Aside from Kanye, who is of course the best?
Yeah, aside from Kanye West.
My favorite has to be Pusha T. That dude has such evocative lyrics and a great cadence.
Yeah, he really makes you feel his words.
I know. I've been following him since back during his time with Clipse.
Same, I remember being young and seeing the video for Grindn with Pharrell and being hooked.
Yeah, it was a mindblowing experience for me. Loved the aesthetic of that video with all the guys on the bike.
And the beat was so spare, but worked so well.
I know, imagine trying to come up with a rap to put over that though? That takes a ton of talent.
