What do you think of Mumford & Sons?
I really enjoy listening to them. They are extremely talented.
Have you listened to Hanson no music lately?
No I haven't, but I will check into it. I remember when their first song came out about 20 years ago.
Do you like Led Zepplin? They are one of my favorite bands.
Mine too! I really like the Immigrant Song; it's definitely one of my all time favorites.
You know Hanson is going on tour in 2017?
Yeah. They will be in Atlanta on September 20th.
Mumford and Sons are coming to Atlanta on September 16th.
We will have to go to both of those.
Marcus Mumford, the main singer, is actually married to actress, Carrie Mulligan.
They have a daughter together.
How do you feel about the Foo Fighters?
Dave Grohl is a genius. He started in Nirvana.
They have a new album coming out this year.
It's called Concrete and Gold. The track list sounds great.
They are touring in the Fall of 2017.
Yeah. They'll be in the United States around October.
I wonder what they're next single will sound like?
Hopefully it sounds more like their old stuff. But they sound great either way.
