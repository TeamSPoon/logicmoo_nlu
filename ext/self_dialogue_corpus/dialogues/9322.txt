Lets talk about gangsta rap
Well I loved NWA
NWA started the whole thing and I loved Easy E
I love Ice cube
Dre had the music on point.
The lyrics were so true to the era and what was going on at the time.
What is the best NWA song ?
I would say they all were good.
I liked easy e solo carrer, He had some hits.
Easy does it was the best song ever by Easy.
