What is your least favorite Star Wars movie?
I really don't like Star Wars episodes one, two, and three.
Those are the ones I dislike the most as well. They are just too cheesy and gimmicky compared to all the others.
I agree. They are a prequel to the originals, but besides somewhat fitting with the storyline, they're not much like the other movies.
Yeah, I feel the same way! Plus, you know, there are characters like Jar Jar Binks.
Ugh. Yeah, exactly.
Have you seen the newest Star Wars films? What do you think about those?
Yeah, I saw The Force Awakens and Rogue One in theaters. I really liked those!
Me too! I thought those movies were well written and really good! They reminded me a lot more of the original films.
Yeah, it's great that they have awesome female leads in the series again. Plus, Rey, Finn, and Jyn are pretty awesome characters.
