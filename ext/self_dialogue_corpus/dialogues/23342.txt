Have you heard about that new movie with Scarlett Johansson?
I don't think so, what is it?
Oh my goodness it looks so funny!
Who else is in it?
I think Jillian Bell and a few others.
I might have seen a trailer for it. Is it the movie about a bachelorette party?
Yes! A group of friends get together for a bachelorette party and some crazy things happen. It looks so funny!
It's called 'Rough Night'. Do you know when it comes out?
I think sometime in June right before Father's Day.
We will have to go see it, I wish Melissa McCarthy was in it though. She's my favorite, and her movie with Sandra Bullock was the best!
The Heat?
Yes! That's my absolute favorite movie of hers.
That was a really great movie, but it almost seemed too far from reality.
You think so? I thought it was great.
I'll tell you a great movie. When they remade Ghostbusters!
Ok, yes! I completely agree.
I think they did a really good job remaking it. I honestly wasn't excited to see it at first.
I was the same way. I thought they couldn't ever make it even remotely close to the quality of the original.
I just looked up Rough Night and it comes out June 16th.
Let's plan on going!
