What do you think about bands playing to a backing track?
I think it is pretty lame
Me too
I wish they just played what they have live
I understand doing it on an album, but not live
I especially don't like it for the voice of the singer
Yeah we cannot tell if he is really that good, or not
It's not as bad as lip syncing though
I agree
There are some organic bands out there though
Like who?
Iron Maiden doesn't do that
They are just pure music
Yes and they are the real deal
I saw them live once
Was it fun?
Yes and no backing track
That is awesome
I think no metal bands should ever have a backing track
Of course they shouldn't. No band should
