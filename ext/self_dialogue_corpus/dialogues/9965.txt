What did you think of the final Matrix movie?
Revolutions?
Yup, that one.
It was too preachy.
I think it would have been fine if they didn't rush it.
What do you mean?
Remember, parts 2 and 3 came out in May and November of the same year?
That explains the crap CGI.
The script, too, it was awful.
Could have been less obvious with the Jesus reference, too.
