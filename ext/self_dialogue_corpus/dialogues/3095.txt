Are you ready for the NFL to return?
I sure am! I think fans everywhere are ready.
I think you are right about that my friend!
I was just setting here talking to my son about the best defensive ends to ever play.
That sounds like an interesting conversation. There have been some great ones.
No doubt about it, my son feels that Julius Peppers is the best ever.
Peppers was great, but not the best ever in my opinion.
I agree with you! I told him that Lee Roy Selmon was the best to ever do it.
I remember him, he absolutely harassed quarterbacks in his prime.
He sure did! He was a six time pro bowler as well.
Who did he spend the majority of his career with?
He played his career with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.
He was awesome, but still not the best.
Who do you think was the best defensive end in NFL history?
The correct answer is a man by the name of Reggie White.
I knew you would say that!  Reggie was awesome for sure.
He was the most dominant football player that I have ever seen.
Do you think he is the best Green Bay Packer of all time as well?
Absolutely! Not even Brett Favre was better!
White was great, but I am gonna stick with Selmon as the best end of all time.
