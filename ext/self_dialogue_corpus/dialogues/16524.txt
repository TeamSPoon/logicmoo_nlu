aside from sia, the uk pop group little mix would open the concert.
who's little mix
oh a UK all female pop group l, they won the Uk x-factor
what year?

i would check them out then, so i get a feel of their music before the concert
they do pop music and "black magic" is their current effort and its doing well atleast in the UK, although i love it too, i would send you a link to download if you want.
oh that be cool,do send.
