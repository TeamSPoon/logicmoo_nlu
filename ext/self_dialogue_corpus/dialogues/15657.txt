You should come over and listen to some music with me.
That sounds like fun, what are we gonna listen to?
Anything you want! You like hip hop music, right?
I have been in a Justin Timberlake mood lately.
I have a lot of his songs actually.
Do you have Can't Stop The Feeling?
Yes! Is that the song from The Trolls sound track?
Yes it is! My daughter loves that song!
What was the other song he had on that sound track?
I think there are a couple more that he did for that movie. The two other ones that I know of are called Hair Up and True Colors.
I think you are right. Do you like any of his older music?
Yes, I love those songs Sexy Back and Cry Me A River.
Me to! Those songs really helped establish him as a great solo artist.
They sure did! Who is your favorite singer at the moment?
I am a huge Bruno Mars fan!
Yea he has some great songs out himself.
Have you ever heard The Lazy Song?
Yes, that song has some awesome lyrics.
Yea, a lot of his songs do.
I think his best song is Just The Way You Are.
