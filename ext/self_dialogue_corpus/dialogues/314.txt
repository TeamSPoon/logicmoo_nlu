DO you think their will be another better wolverine
Nah Jackman was the best
Well he did play the role
He played it well for over ten years
That is quite a long time and good
Sad to see him go
i know and i am not sure who is going to measure up
I am not sure if anyone ever actually can
Yeah it is going to be big shoes to fill
Maybe almost impossible
