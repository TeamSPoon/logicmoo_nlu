What Lady Gaga song do you think would be good to work out to?
Applause would be a good uptempo song to excercise to.
Oh, yeah.  I could picture that one playing during a spin class.
Maybe even Bad Romance.
That could work, too.
A lot of her songs have a fast tempo, don't you think?
Yeah.  Born This Way is pretty fast.
So is Just Dance.
Is Paparazzi fast or slow?
I think it's in between.  It's not exactly a dance song, but it has a good tempo.
