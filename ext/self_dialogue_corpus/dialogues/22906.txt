What's your favorite Robin Hood movie?
That would have to be the 1939 Adventures of Robin Hood with Errol Flynn and Olivia De Havilland.
That's one of the best films ever made, in my opinion.
in glorious color when most films were still madei n black and white.
Basil Rathbone was a wonderful hissable villain, Sir Guy of Gisbourne.
I hissed a lot at Claude Rains as Prince John too.
You can't beat those two for playing bad guys. They were great adversaries for Flynn's Robin Hood.
And Olivia never looked more beautiful than she did in this film, in my opinion.
The music by Korngold is a classic score as well.
The swordfight between Sir Guy and Robin at the end, with the long shadows and terrific choreography, was breathtaking to watch.
Rathbone and Flynn were considered two of the best on-screen fencers in the business, and this battle really showed them off.
And I loved the lighter moments, like the sequence when Robin and Little John "recruit" Friar Tuck into their band of merry men.
Eugene Pallette played Friar Tuck, and he was an unexpected and wonderful swordsman in his own right.
He was an awesome Tuck.
How does this classic stand against, say, Kevin Costner's Robin Hood.
I will say that Costner did his best to do the legend justice, but dude, he wasn't British, and he didn't have the right accent.
Yeah, took me right out of the dream every time he opened his mouth. He sure looked great in the part, at least.
Alan Rickman stole that movie, with the most entertaining, over the top Sheriff you could ever imagine.
I had a lot of fun watching Alan Rickman. He made the movie worth watching, for me.
But I'll always love the Errol Flynn Robin Hood the best.
