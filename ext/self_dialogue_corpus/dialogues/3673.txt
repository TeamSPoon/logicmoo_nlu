Have you ever seen Momento?
Oh my God yes, hardly anyone knows that movie but it was great.
I know what you mean.  They used the plot device of an unreliable witness to mastery.
Yeah, and how that girl tricked him into killing his friend the cop.
And how that cop was getting him to kill other people.
One of my favorite lines from the movie was a funny one though.
Yeah, when he was like "Why am I chasing this guy" and he tries to shoot him.
Then he's like "Oh no, he's chasing me"
Yeah that was good.
His tattoos were pretty good too.
