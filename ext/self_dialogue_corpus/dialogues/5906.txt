I never really liked Disney movies as a kid.
Oh, I did. Especially the old ones like Sleeping Beauty.
Bambi was devastating though.
True. And I cried so hard during dumbo.
What did you think of 90's Disney movies?
I really liked The Little Mermaid.
Beauty and the Beast was good too. Have you seen the new version?
I haven't seen the new version yet.
My niece is obsessed with Frozen.
I like what they've done with the princess genre.
