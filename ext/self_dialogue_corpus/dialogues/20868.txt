Have you seen Wonder Woman yet?
I've been meaning to, but haven't gotten around to it.
I enjoyed it. It's gotten good reviews on Rotten Tomatoes. I liked the back story about how the WWI plate ties back to Wayne Enterprises.
I wasn't aware that the movie had Batman in it?
It doesn't, but the connection piqued my interest. It did the same to you.
I heard that Diana Prince rescued a pilot.
That was the younger Diana. Captain Steve Trevor crashes along an island coast and then the German military that's been chasing Trevor arrives.
What a lot of action in the opening scene. What was your favorite part?
For me it was when the story turns. Sir Patrick tells Diana that he's Ares and that he has been giving humans their inspirations to destroy themselves.
How does that tie in with the rest of the story?
Ares says that even though he has given humans their destructive desires, that it's really they who are responsible since they are the ones with free will and are performing the actual violent acts.
Ahhh.... So Diana's the hero who's going to save humanity from themselves?
Well, Kind of. Ares tells Diana that she, as the daughter of god killer Zeus, is actually the destroyer of humanity.
How does she take that?
Ares tries to convince Diana to help him destroy humanity. She declines. It turns into a battle between Diana and Ares.
That's kind of the way that I thought it would go. So Batman's not in the movie at all?
Well, let me explain first. Captain Trevor saves the world by sacrificing himself in an act where he takes a bomber filled with deadly gas to a high altitude and detonates it, killing himself in the process.
I don't see the connection to Batman.
After Trevor's death, Ares tries to convince Diana to destroy humanity again. She declines; and they flash forward to the present day, the end of the movie and Diana is typing an email...
Let me guess, the email is to Bruce Wayne, right?
