What's your taste in music?
I like lemon. Just kidding!
"They Call Me Me Mellow Yellow..."
Sweet, but no. I'm a lover of worship music.
You mean songs like "Amazing Grace" and "The Devil Went Down to Georgia?"
Nice try, but no. Contemporary Christian music is what I listen to mostly.
Why?
I prefer contemporary music with meaning and inspiration.
Like what?
I love alot of the music that comes from "Jesus Culture" and "All Sons and Daughters".
I've never heard of them. What do they sound like.
Jesus Culture is christian worship music with a rock and pop sound.
I can dig that.
And All Sons and Daughtes is a bit more mellow. One of my all time favorites is their version of "Great Are You Lord."
When do you listen to that?
I've got it playing on my iPod right now. Here, listen!
Hey, that's not too bad. All Sons and Daughters?
All Sons and Daughters.
Well, I wasn't expecting that answer, but I can see why you like it.
Yeah. If I'm going to be listening to music at work, I prefer it e something that help lower my stress level!
