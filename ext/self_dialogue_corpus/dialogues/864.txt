It's the most wonderful time of the year.
Christmas?
No, silly! Football season!
Oh yeah, right. Not quite but soon.
Not that far off. Season begins September 7th with the preseason kick off on August 3rd, less than a month away!
Oh wow, that can't believe how fast this year has gone by. Who is starting us off?
Hall of Fame game of Dallas Cowboys versus Arizona Cardinals on NBC.
That is going to be an intense game. Even if I wasn't a major Cowboys fan I wouldn't want to miss it.
Been keeping up with their players lately?
Been keeping up with their cheerleaders mostly, but did hear a couple players had some issues this past week.
Oh? What's up?
Well linebacker Damien Wilson was arrested for suspicion of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon. Then running back Darren McFadden family was injured in that Little Rock shooting.
Oh no, that's horrible! What happened?
I don't know all the details, but I'll update you if I hear more soon.
Appreciate it. Thanks man.
No problem. Any other good pregames to look forward to?
August 25th Kansas City Chiefs at Seattle Seahawks should be promising.
Ooo. That will be a good one. What's Denver look like?
They're earlier on. August 10th I think at Chicago Bears.
Bears don't stand a chance in Hell, but I'll be in the area that week so I may check it out anyways.
