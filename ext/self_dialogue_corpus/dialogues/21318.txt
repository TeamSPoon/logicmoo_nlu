What did you think about the movie moonlight.
I enjoyed it, for a black movie it dealt with a touchy topic.
I know what you mean.
Hopefully the movie opened up some dialogue.
The movie became best picture.
I know even though some thought La La land would get it.
Do you think the young man was in denial about his sexuality.
I think he was at first as time went on he accepted it.
But he did not have any other sexual experiences, just that one.
Well I know it would seem like he was in denial perhaps he had not met anyone else he cared about.
I liked how in the end it looked like he was back with the only man he ever had a sexual experience with.
I know, maybe he felt they would somehow cross paths again.
Its a shame in this day and age some gay man are still not accepted.
Especially in our communities.
I know earlier in the movie the couple that helped in made him feel he mattered.
You and the man became a sort of father figure.
The women became a mother figure
His own mother was strung out on drugs.
I  found that part of the movie sad, in the beginning it looked like she was trying to be a good parent.
I did seem that way until she got caught up in the drugs.
