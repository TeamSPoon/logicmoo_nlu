Who was the better mentor to Luke Skywalker, Obi Wan Kenobi or Yoda?
Of course Yoda is the better mentor!
Why is Yoda the better mentor?
It's because Obi Wan Kenobi got killed by Darth Vader in the first movie.
Ah, that's true.
Right! Obi Wan Kenobi did not really teach Luke Skywalker anything before he died.
I think he told him about the force.
He did, but Yoda was the one who helped train Luke Skywalker.
It would of been better if he was trained by the both of them at the same time.
Yes! He would have better skills.
