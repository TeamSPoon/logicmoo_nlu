Are you a fan of older horror movies?
Absolutely! Have you seen the Hellraiser series?
Yes, I love how mysterious and demonic it is.
Me too, its crazy how they rip peoples faces apart with chains and hooks.
It is so cool how the cenobites are spawned by using a puzzle cube.
Yeah, it really adds to the mysteriousness of it all.
I was a huge fan of the first two movies in the series, but after that it just became random.
They really started just killing anyone instead of killing the person who unlocks the puzzle cube.
It fell apart from the old Hellraiser story from the comics.
Yes it did, its a shame how terrible those movies became later on.
