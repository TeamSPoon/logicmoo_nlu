Which NFL teams do you think will make it to the Super Bowl in 2018?
Wow. I hadn't thought about that yet. I guess I can see the Patriots making it again.
What about the Falcons?
I don't know about them. Last year was kind of a fluke for that team.
Well, I wouldn't call it a fluke. More like a Cindarella story.
Kind of like the Cubs making it to the World Series.
Not quite that dramatic, but it was a surprise.
I don't see the Falcons making it all the way again this coming year.
I guess we'll see. What about the Broncos?
Not without Manning. Probably not, anyway.
How about the Seahawks?
Yeah, maybe. They're a great team.
They won the Super Bowl a few years ago.
Who did they beat in that game?
Denver. The Broncos.
Oh, right! They stomped them. I think a lot of people lost money betting on the Broncos.
So true. Everyone was surprised, I think.
Except maybe hardcord Seattle fans.
Of which I am one. I love the Seahawks.
Well, maybe a Seahawks/Patriots matchup will be in store for us in 2018.
