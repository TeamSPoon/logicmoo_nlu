What do you think will happen in episode 8 and 9?
I think the Jedi will come be different
I hope they stop fighting
The starkiller base was pretty epic
Do you think they'll rebuild one of those?
I think they'll build something
They need to get their government under control
It would be nice to see them working together in the end
Too bad it's called Star Wars
I think Rey will do some training in the next one
