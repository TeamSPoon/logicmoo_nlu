Have you seen the new Disney movie, Moana?
Yeah, I have! What did you think?
I liked it! I love Lin-Manuel Miranda, so it was great to hear music from him.
Actually, I thought the music could have been more memorable.
Moana got a couple of great songs. And I loved "Shiny"!
Okay, that whole sequence with the giant crab was great.
The animation was beautiful, too. All those green islands!
Yeah, it made me want to visit the South Pacific.
And I thought Maui was a great character. So funny, but with a heart.
I really enjoyed it, and I hope there's a sequel one of these days!
