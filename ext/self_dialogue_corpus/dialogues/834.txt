Are you ready for the NFL season?
Absolutely, I am ready to tailgate!
Do you think it will be a new team to win this year.
I hope the Bears win, what about you?
I would rather the Chiefs win.
I'm sick of seeing the same teams in the superbowl.
I agree completely, it seems the Paitroits are always in it.
That's what happens when you cheat to win.
Or just deflate a ball over and over.
What other teams would you want to see in the Superbowl.
Well if it was not my number one pick it would have to be the Packers.
I would say the Colts.
But both teams have been in it before.
Just as long as it is not the Raiders!
Yeah the Raiders are my most hated team.
Broncos would also be nice.
Indeed, I really just want a midwest team to win.
Would that include the Vikings?
No way! I will never route for the Vikings
Or the 49ers!
