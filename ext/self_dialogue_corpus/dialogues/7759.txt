So I watched the first Harry Potter movie again yesterday.  It's the first time I've watched it in years.
Me too!  I think it's the best one they made.
Yeah, when everyone got older it just seemed a little strange.
The last movies seemed to take a darker, more serious tone too.
They weren't as fun as the first one was.
The first movie really was inspiring.  It made me dream about what it would be like to live in that world.
It made everybody want to live in that world too.  It had more hope in it.
Also, it made me hope Hermione and Harry would get together.
I did too. I think they made a better couple.
I want to watch that movie again today!
