What did you think of the Harry Potter movie "Prisoner of Azkaban"?
Some of the best scenes in the series are in that one.
Like what?
My favorite snapshot is when the camera slowly zooms out while Vernon and Petunia look up as Vernon's sister floats away.
I loved that one!
The slow zoom out shows Dudley covered in cake in the sun room, watching tv, as his parents pound the ground in utter humiliation and agony.
It's just beautiful and a great visual into who they are as characters and what Harry must deal with in regards to his only family.
I like how that one really got into just how awful Harry's so called family was. Really great scenery.
The new director was fantastic, and it showed immediately
I was not even aware it was a new director. The films there after did have a new feel.
