Have you seen any thriller movies about dinosaurs?
Yeah, I just watched Jurassic Park for like the 500th time.
I love that movie! It's intense.
It definitely is. Do you remember the part where the T-Rex eats the guy who was in the bathroom?
Yeah, that was awesome. But my favorite part is when the Velociraptors are chasing people around in buildings.
That part was tense. I thought for sure they would kill all those people.
It would be so scary to be in that situation.
I think its pretty odd they didn't have a bunch of guns around.
Me too, considering they were surrounded by dangerous dinosaurs.
I'm gonna have to watch that movie again, I'm excited just thinking about it.
