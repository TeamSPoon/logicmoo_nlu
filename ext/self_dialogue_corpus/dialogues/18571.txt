Who is your favorite band?
I love the beatles.
Oh yeah! I love them too.
They're classic. What's your favorite song?
Oh boy, that's a hard one. So many to choose from!
I know! I like all of their music throughout their development.
They were so revolutionary. How about a favorite album?
I love the white album. So different.
Wonderful album. Sgt Peppers is my favorite!
Oh yeah! That one was trippy, but had a message!
Some of their best work I think.
I had that one on vinyl.
So here's the million dollar question. Favorite Beatle?
Paul McCartney! He was a hottie and had the most talent!
Interesting, most people say John Lennon, and on occasion George Harrison!
They were good too, of course. Just something about Paul.
Poor Ringo never gets any recognition.
Haha yeah, he was alright, more there for personality I think.
I wish I could have seen them in concert.
Me too, but at least we still get to listen to their wonderful music.
