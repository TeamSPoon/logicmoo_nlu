So, do you think Watto could learn the ways of the force?
No, he's a toyderian. I don't know what that means, but he is one of those.
It's funny that there are so many classes of people.
Yeah, Tattoine seems to have lots of different races.
I thought that Watto was a good character.
Yeah, I liked how greedy he was.
I wonder what happened to him after episode 2.
He probably just stayed on Tattoine.
I preferred the Watto from Episode 1.
Me too. He had like two lines in the Episode 2. That us not enough.
