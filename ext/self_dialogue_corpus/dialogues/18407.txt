Which do you like better, the Monkees as a TV show or the Monkees as a musical group?
Definitely like the music better than the TV show.
What is your favorite Monkees song?
It's hard to pick but I would have to say Pleasant Valley Sunday because you hear all four of them and it's a great little pop song.
Who do you prefer as a lead singer for the Monkees?
I actually prefer Mike Nesmith.
Why?
I just think his songs have more meat to them and I can sing along to them better.
Who do you think is the better singer between Davy Jones and Micky Dolenz?
I prefer Micky Dolenz because his songs are more popular and he has a better singing voice.
Did you know two of the Monkees were born on the same day (just different years)?
Yes -- both Mike Nesmith and Davy Jones were born on December 30th.
Did you know that the Monkees were the only group from the 1960's that had all four living members until 2012?
Yes - bascially all groups from the 1960's had lost a member due to drugs or alcohol or other reason, but the Monkees were all alive until Davy Jones' untimely death in 2012.
What happened to Davy Jones?
He died of a heart attack on his horse farm in Florida.
Do the Monkees still tour?
Yes the Monkees are out on a 50th Anniversary tour right now.
Is it all three members touring?
No, just Micky Dolenz and Peter Tork.  Mike Nesmith has retired from singing.
