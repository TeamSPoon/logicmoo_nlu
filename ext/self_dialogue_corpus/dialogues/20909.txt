Do you want to go out tonight?
Not really, I would rather stay in and watch some movies.
That sounds like fun. What do you want to watch?
Something silly would be great.
Have you ever watched any Pauly Shore movies?
I think I have, but it has been a long time.
He has some pretty funny movies actually.
Was he in a movie about the army?
Yes, it is called In The Army Now.
That is it, I have never seen the whole movie.
It is pretty good. It also has Andy Dick in it.
What other movies has he done?
He played in Jury Duty. I enjoyed that one as well.
Yea I watched that one with my mom a long time ago.
My favirote movie of his was Encino Man.
I remember that one! Who else was in that movie?
Brendan Fraser; they had great chemistry with one another.
I agree, that is a very underrated movie.
So, which one do you want to watch?
I think we should watch Jury Duty. I love that one!
