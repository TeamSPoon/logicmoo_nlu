I can't wait for football season!
I know man. It is going to be awesome.
I just watched a video on some of the best receivers.
That's cool. Did Julian Edelman make the list?
He did, but I am unsure why.
What do you mean?
Well, I haven't really seen him make too many great catches.
But he had an awesome SuperBowl catch! A nearly impossible catch!
True, but that is one play and I don't feel as if a play defines a player.
You're right. I like him though.
I like Edelman too but Malcolm Mitchell is my favorite Patriots receiver.
What? No way. Why?
We went to the same university and I respect his work
Oh, okay. That's understandable.
Also, I think that it is amazing that he made it to the Patriots fresh out of college.
Yeah, it is pretty amazing. He is really good.
I like Amari Cooper, from the Raiders, too. He went to the University of Alabama.
Oh, nice! That's where Julio Jones went.
Yeah, they have an awesome football program.
Nick Saban, the coach, is awesome.
