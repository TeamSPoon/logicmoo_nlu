Country, what about you?
I like country too, and hip hop
Hip hops fun, especially for dancing.
It is
I used to go to this club that had line dancing
That sounds fun, what kinds of songs?
I knew the dances to cotton eye joe, sweet home alabama, and copperhead road
I bet that's fun
It is and copperhead road is a fun song especially because it gets faster.
I can see that, I've always wanted to learn how to line dance
It's a lot more fun then people think
Especially with the right music I bet
