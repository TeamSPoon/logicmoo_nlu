My kids will not stop watching Aladdin.
Oh, I love that movie.
They sing along to "Never Had a Friend Like Me" over and over again.
It must be funny seeing them try to do all the different Robin William's voices.
My youngest one pets the screen every time Raja comes on.
Is that the tiger?
Yeah, and she loves Abu, too.
I always thought Aladdin was kind of cute.
what? That so funny.  He is a cartoon character.
I meant if he was a real life person, obviously.
