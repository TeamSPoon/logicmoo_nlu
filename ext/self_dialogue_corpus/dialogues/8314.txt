The new Lorde album is a masterpiece.
I haven't heard it yet, what's it called?
The new one is called Melodrama, it's produced by Jack Antonoff.
Whoa no way, Jack Antonoff produced it?
Yup, he seems to be everywhere nowadays.
True that, I am even more excited to hear it now.
You should be, the song Supercut is a grade A masterpiece.
Is it on Spotify?
Yeah it is but I have it physical.
Oh nice we can take a ride in your car and listen.
