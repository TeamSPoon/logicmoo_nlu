What do you think happens to Carrie Fisher's character?
From what I read, CGI.
That would be cool but I Think they need to wrap it up.
In what sense?
Maybe kill her off.
Why does it have to be like that?
What other option do you have?
You could have her retire.
That does not work with the series.
Lucas could unfold another angle.
