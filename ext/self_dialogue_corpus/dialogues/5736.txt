Were you a fan of the Hunchback of Notre Dame?
I thought it was great as a kid, but I watched it recently and not so much.
I did too, Esmeralda was my secret crush.
She was prety cute for a cartoon, I just wish she was in a better movie.
It was very depressing as a kids movie.
It was like a history documentary versus an adventure of wonder.
Usually Disney films hold up over the years.
Well this is not one of those.
Especially after that second one.
Yeah they should have stopped when they could.
