Who is your favorite music artist?
I really like Lady Gaga.
Yes! She is very unique.
I have to agree.  She always gets people talking.
What is your favorite song by her?
I really enjoy listening to "Bad Romance."
Me too.  It makes me just want to sing along and turn the volume up.
I like to turn the volume up on her songs especially in the car.
How about when she went to the award show in the egg thing?
I remember that! It was very interesting.
