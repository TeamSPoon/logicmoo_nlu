Have you ever seen Bad Santa?
No I haven't? What is that?
Billy Bob Thorton plays a thief who pretends to be Santa.
That is crazy! Why would he do that?
He uses his position as Santa to rob a mall.
That is crazy! Is anyone else in this?
Bernie Mac is in it. He was great.
Wow! I am so sad that he is gone.
It is sad that he died. You should remember the good things he did though.
I will. I will have to check this movie out now!
