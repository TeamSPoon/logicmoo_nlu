What's your favorite movie?
I don't like movies
Why not?
It's a waste of time
How so?
It makes you lazy
What do you do with your down time?
I sleep
Sleep..?
Yea
But what do you do when you are tired but not sleepy?
I read
Read what?
Fiction
But fiction is a waste of time
No, I'm reading
But it's still pointless madeup stuff
I dont agree
You're an odd person
..thanks..
