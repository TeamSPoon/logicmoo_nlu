Let's catch the game tonight at my house.
Okay. Who is playing?
The Bears and the 49ers.
Okay. That doesn't seem like an excited game.
All NFL games are worth watching.
Maybe, but some are better than others.
That is true my friend, but at least it is football.
Yes, and it is away from the house for a while.
See, football to the rescue.
I will be there. I may fall asleep though.
Is life hitting hard right now?
Yeah, just exhausted. School is kicking my butt.
At least the game can be a good escape.
I can definately use one of those.
I am glad to help.
I will even leave my books at home.
You better dude.
It's good brother.
I will have pizza.
I will bring drinks.
