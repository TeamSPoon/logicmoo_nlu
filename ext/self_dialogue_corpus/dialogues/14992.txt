Better comedy Monty Python and The Holy Grail, or Groundhog Day?
Is this a serious question? Groundhog Day is enjoyable, if a bit overplayed on TV, but Python all the way.
I would agree if we were talking The Life of Brian, but always felt Holy Grail was overrated.
No way, how could you not laugh at some of the scenes?
Notice I never said I didn't laugh, it's still a funny film, although never been huge on British humor.
Well I will concede that Life of Brian was even better and while I love Bill Murray, Groundhog Day isn't on the same level.
Well we can agree to disagree, Murray makes anything better.
Oh he does indeed, but Monty Python makes everything better as well.
I did really laugh at the banging coconuts for hooves.
Ha yeah that was great.
