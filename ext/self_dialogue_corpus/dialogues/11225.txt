Are you going to Fashion week this year?
Yes, I think I'm going to see the fall collections in New York this Fall.
What will you wear?
Well, it depends on the shows I will see but something beautiful of course.
I've been really into stuff from Kenzo and Balenciaga lately.
Me too.
What do you think about this seasons trends?
I don't like getting involved with the newest fashion trends all that much.
I know what you mean. I like a lot of classics fashion pieces.
Absolutely, you can never go wrong with classic fashion pieces from the times or Audrey Hepburn or even Marilyn Monroe.
Definitely. Sometimes I like a newer print but for the most part I like neutrals and black.
You can never go wrong in basic black.
That's for sure!
Where are you heading now? Shopping?
Yes, actually I am headed over to H&M. They always have the best designer collaborations and they're inexpensive.
So true. I loved their collection with Isabel Marant.
Target also does some great collaborations.
Yes, for sure. They are great especially for fashion for younger girls.
Yes, they have great basic pieces like solid tank tops and classic t shirts.
I agree!
