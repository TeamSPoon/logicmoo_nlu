Do you think Elvis truly is the king of rock and roll.
Yes I do.
There was a lot of originals like chuck berry but Elvis took,it to another level.
Yes he did.can you imagine not showing him from the waist down on Ed Sullivan.
I know,times,have changed.
They sure have.
What a voice.
What a performer.
So many hits.
I love his real old ones.
Oh yea,jailhouse rock,return to sender.
That's just a couple.
How about,I'm all shook up and good luck charm.
Yes,and of course,I can't help falling in love with you.
When he did that song live,the show was over.
That was always his last song.
He did no encores at all.
No he didn't.
Elvis has left the building.
That was said at the end of every performance.
