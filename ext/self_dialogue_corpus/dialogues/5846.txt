What is your favorite Disney movie?
I really love The Little Mermaid.
Oh, I grew up watching that! I love the music.
Me too, I still know all the words to Under the Sea.
I used to think I was a mermaid like Ariel. Do you like other Disney movies from the time?
I think so -- like Beauty and the Beast?
Yes, or Aladdin?
I don't care for Aladdin, but I really liked Beauty and the Beast.
Yes, I think Beauty and the Beast is great. Have to seen the remake?
No, I haven't. But I plan to when it comes out on DVD.
