What's your favorite Britney Spears album?
Oh my, I don't know! They're all so good.
Just pick any! There's gotta be one.
Okay, her first album 'Baby One More Time' is probably my all time favorite!
Really?? Why is that?
I don't know! I think it's 'cause she had plenty of really awesome songs there.
I agree, my favorite was 'From the Bottom of my Broken Heart.'
Ah, that song always brings me to tears.
Do you have a favorite in that album?
If I had to pick, it would be 'Sometimes.' It just talks about young love you know?
Totally. I totally forgot about 'Email my Heart.'
Ah that is like such a cute song. Do you have a favorite Britney album?
I think 'Oops I did it again' is probably the best one she's done.
Her sales for that were definitely off the charts.
Yea! And she was starting to find her true identity.
Right, she talked about it in 'Stronger.'
Yes! I love that song.  And 'Lucky' is also another hit.
We can't forget about 'Lucky,' those lyrics were so catchy.
Ah I love Britney! I miss her oldies.
Yes me too. Let's listen to her now.
