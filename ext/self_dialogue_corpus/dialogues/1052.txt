Have you seen the Saints roster for training camp?
Yeah, It looks good, I think Brees is going to have a great year.
They are in a tough division though.
Not really, the NFC isn't looking all that strong this year.
Who do you think is going to win the NFC South?
The Saints, probably, but its going to be a tight one.
What about the NFC North?
Green Bay has got that division locked up for sure.
Yeah, Rodgers is no joke, he's easily the best quarterback in that division,
Don't count out Detroit though.
Who do you have winning the Super Bowl?
I really like Denver this year.
I think Kansas City is a better team.
Maybe, but they just don't have the depth to take them into the post-season.
Don't count out Pittsburg.
No Doubt, they are always late playoff contenders.
Who do you have winning the NFC?
I'm sticking with New Orleans, my man.
I think it's going to be Washington.... everyone is going to sleep on them and they are going to catch fire late.
No way, not out of that division. Dallas wont let them.
