Have you seen any of the batman films?
Of course! Who hasn't?
What was your favoritre one?
Defniitely The Dark Knight.
What about Batman Begins?
That one was good but the other 2 were much better.
I think The Dark Knight Rises was definitely my favorite.
I liked that one, but I wish the Joker was in it.
I know. Heath Ledger had a fantastic performance.
What is your favorite film that he is in?
Actually, I haven't seen any other of his.
Me too. The Dark Knight is the only one.
I will say, the storyline in The Dark Knight Rises is really good.
I think the soundtrack from The Dark Knight makes the movie though.
True. Hans Zimmer is awesome.
He scores a lot of films that I like.
I think he put a great score together in Inception too.
Wow! I forgot about that movie!
Is it better than the batman films?
No way.
