I love cats. What movies should I watch?
You need to watch The Aristocrats! A great musical starring cats and kittens!
Wow! Who are the main characters?
A mother and her three kittens--they have to go on the run from their home in Paris.
Oh no!
Luckily, the encounter a street-wise tom-cat who helps them out.
When is the movie set?
I think its the 40s or the 50s.
Are there any other animals in the movie?
Oh yeah--there are geese and horses!
