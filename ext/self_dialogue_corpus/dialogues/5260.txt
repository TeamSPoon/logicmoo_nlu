Do you have a favourite Disney Princess?
Yes, my favourite one is Princess Jasmine from the movie Aladdin.
Cool! She is my favourite too, I love that movie!
Do you know when that movie was released?
I think it was some time in the 90's, but I can't be sure.
Yea that's what I would guess too.
I remember watching Aladdin as a child and always being amazed by his flying carpet.
Tell me about it, I need a flying carpet of my own!
That would be so cool, I'd never be late to anything.
Maybe a genie of my own too! I could use 3 wishes!
