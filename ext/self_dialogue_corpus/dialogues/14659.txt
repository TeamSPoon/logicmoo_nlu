You like basketball right?
Yes, I do a lot. Mostly pro ball.
Are you into the classic games?
Yeah, I like watching any with Wilt Chamberlein.Do you?
Yeah, he was a legend. I stick to old ones with Jordan for sure. Did you think he was the best?
No, I would have to go with Kareem Abdul Jaabar. He is a legend.
He was. Do you follow any teams now?
Yes, I follow the Atlanta Hawks.
There center is Dwight Howard right?
Yeah, he plays a good game. Do you follow any teams closely?
I follow the Hawks too. I also follow the Lakers close, Their point guard is really great.
Jordan Clarkson? HE scored high points in a game I seen in person.
Have you seen a lot of NBA games in person?
I have seen a few. I like the international ones.
I was not aware of those.
Yeah, they do them sometimes for charity,go to another country and play. It is really cool.
I would like to see basketball in another country.
It was worth the price. Did you catch the last Hawks game?
No, I did not get a chance. Was it tense?
Oh yeah, they always are.
