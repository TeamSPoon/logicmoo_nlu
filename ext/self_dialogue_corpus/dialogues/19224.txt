Did you watch last years MTV awards?
I think so, they're like the VMA's right?
Yeah, except more targeted towards the younger audience.
I vaguely remember it, I remember the artists performing more than anything.
Beyonce's performance, that was the highlight.
Yes! She was pregnant and stood on a chair and sang from her last album.
Lemonade, right?
Yep, exactly. I thought the performance itself was alright but I liked the music.
Yeah, I think Lemonade is a great album too.
What are your favorite songs from it?
I actually really love Don't Hurt Yourself.
With Jack White, right?
Yes, I just love the passion in the song!
It is a good one. I also like Hold Up.
Yep, same thing with the passion! And the music video!
I always love watching someone destroy things with a baseball bat.
What I like about the album is that all the songs really do go together.
What do you mean?
Like, they all have a common theme and sound.
Oh, yeah I agree with that.
