The Halloween movies will be on soon.
Which is your favorite?
Hocus Pocus. I don't like anything gorey.
Neither do I. It's so unnecessary to have all that violence.
I feel like life is violent and horrible enough for some without us turning that into entertainment.
That's pretty much how I feel too.
That's why I like family movies.
So do I. Hocus Pocus is a good choice.
Want to watch it with me?
Sure. Do you get the right channel?
Yes. It is on at six so let's get ready to watch it.
I don't watch movies too often but this one is one I've liked since childhood.
I did too. I watch it every Halloween.
I used to but haven't seen it for ages.
You're in for a treat then.
I love the witches. They're so funny.
Yes. I like all the characters accept for that bratty little girl.
It seems there's always a brat in these movies.
True.
They are better without them in there, though.
