When do the 49ers start their summer training camp?
I think it is the 3rd week in July. The 22nd I believe.
Are you going down to see them?
I will try to see a couple of practices during the week.
Did you get the single ticket offer in mail yesterday?
I did. I'm thinking about doing it.
Me too. I'm a little concerned about where my seats might be.
Have you thought about the standing section in the back?
Can you see the 49ers bench from there?
Yes, you get a pretty decent view of both teams from those seats.
Do you think the 49ers will have a .500 season?
I hope so. They handed out some pretty big contracts if the off season.
I think the coach will be gone if they don't
I'm not sure about that. They've got him for 3 more years.
Yeah - it will probably take a something awful to happen before they move him
Did you make your Superbowl reservation yet?
I've got the hotel room - we'll see what happens
I think our ticket options will be very limited, unless we want to spend a coupe grand
I would get moving on flight and hotel if you are the least bit interested in being there for game time
I'll reach out to my ticket broker today
