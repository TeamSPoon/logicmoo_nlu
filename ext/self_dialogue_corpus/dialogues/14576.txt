Do you think Derrick Rose is done?
Well I mean he will keep playing basketball but I think MVP Rose is gone.
It is such a shame he was so athletic and fun to watch.
Yes, but all those knee surgeries and downtimes are really catching up with him.
Yeah that same slashing speed seems to be gone.
That's what I think too. Plus he is in Knicks purgatory now too.
Yeah, no one comes back from that dark place.
Yeah and they have two super ball dominant players running the triangle.  It makes no sense.
Well it makes sense if it was 1990.
Yeah and you had Michael Jordan to make it all look good.
As good as Jordan was I think it was the fact that zone defense was illegal that made the zone viable.
Probably. I wonder why they changed that rule.
Probably because it made the game less fun to watch.
True, that is the same reason they are going to get rid of the hack-a-Shaq.
I think you are right but I wish they wouldn't.
Why? It is so bad to watch.
I agree with that but it seems like ensuring you can hit free throws should not be too much to ask of NBA players.
That makes sense but I just don't care.  I don't want to watch free throws anyways.
Yeah I think a lot of people feel like that.
They do and that is why they are going to fix hack-a-Shaq with some rule change.
