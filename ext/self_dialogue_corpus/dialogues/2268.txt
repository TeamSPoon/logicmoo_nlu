What is your least favorite thing about the NFL?
My least favorite thing would probably be the injuries.
Yeah, the injures always make me feel bad.
Me too! Like these men are just trying to do their jobs.
And a lot of them are really young too.
That's true. Like Teddy Bridgewater.
Yeah, his injury was really nasty. I felt so terrible for him.
I heard he could potentially miss the 2017 season because of it.
That honestly makes me so sad.
Yeah, me too. I hope he comes back soon.
I hope he comes back soon too, but only if he's ready.
Yeah, I don't want him to feel pressured to make a return and get hurt worse.
Especially because he's so young too.
Yeah, I think he's only 24.
I don't want him to be the next Austin Collie.
Don't say that, that guy had so many concussions it was ridiculous.
It really was. I don't want Teddy to be like that.
I don't want anyone to be like that.
Concussions are terrible.
I'm glad we both agree on that.
