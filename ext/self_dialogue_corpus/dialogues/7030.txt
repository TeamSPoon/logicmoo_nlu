I watched Beauty and the Beast for the first time last night.
That movie is a classic! What did you think?
Belle is great, but I think she is too good to be with the Beast.
I think that's the point of the movie though - the beast isn't really that bad when you get to know him.
I guess so. I really like the fact that Belle loves to read.
I love when the Beast shows her the library and she gets so excited.
Yes! I wish I could have a library like Belle.
Did you like the soundtrack?
I loved the soundtrack. I can't stop singing "This Provencial Life"
My favorite song is Be Our Guest.
