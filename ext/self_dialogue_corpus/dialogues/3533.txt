What do you think of vampire movies?
I love them.
What is your favorite one?
I like Subspecies.
Is that American?
No, it is foreign.
Cool. What other vampire movies do you like?
Abbot and Costello Meet Frankenstein is great, cause Dracula is in it. But, it's pretty comedic.
Nice, have you seen Nosferatu?
Yes, I love that silent film.
