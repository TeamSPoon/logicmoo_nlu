Marley and Me had me crying.
I think Marley and Me had everybody crying.
I just wish it hadn't with Marley's awful life towards the end...
Eh. Yeah. I'm really looking forward to that movie about the marine and her dog though.
Megan Leavey! It looks so good!
I just hope the dog doesn't die in it.
Well, dogs die.
Yeah but I like that thing where it fades out and then it's the real picture of the dog and they tell you what happened to them.
Oh I wasn't even thinking of that-
It's less gut-wrenching that way.
Totally. Lots of movies based on true stories do that, too, so it's super possible.
Yeah. I'll watch it anyway, though.
Me too - you know there's a website that tells you if the dog dies in any given movie, right?
Really? That's hilarious. So I'm not the only one here?
No, not at all. Too many dog-lovers.
I bet it got started after John Wick came out.
Probably, haha. That was pretty brutal.
It was. I don't like how so many movies with the dog dying are good.
The writers are getting you where it hurts when a beloved dog dies.
Yeah, actually I think you're right. It's kinda worse than people dying because it's not as common.
