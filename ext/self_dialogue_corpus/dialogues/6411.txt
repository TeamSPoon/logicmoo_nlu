Do you ever think Disney will ever make a new Aladdin movie?
I think so, it's a classic.
I wonder who would star in it as the main characters.
I think Jake Gyllenhaal would play a great Aladdin.
Who do you think would play a good princess Jasmine?
I think Vanessa Hudgens has the right look to play the part.
Wow. That would make quite the cast.
Agreed. I think Disney would deliver if they decided to remake a modern Aladdin.
I think the scenery would be especially great if they shot the movie in the deserts of the Middle East.
It would be fantastic!
