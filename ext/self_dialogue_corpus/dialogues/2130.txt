Planning to watch the NFL this fall?
Not really, kinda tired of it all.
Really? Why?
Same ol' same ol'. Watch hundreds of games over fifty years and they all start to look the same.
That surprises me. You used to he a huge Miami Dolphins fan. Larry Csonka was your hero.
Yep, I even sported a number 39 jersey through most of elementary school.
I remember that from old family photos. Who was the QB then?
Bob Griese. One of the most underrated QBs ever.
I barely remember him. When did he stop playing?
Around 1981 or so. Dan Marino took over after him.
The Dolphins were a great team back in the 70s, won a few superbowls.
Yeah and went undefeated in 1972. Still the only team that's done that.
New England almost did it a few years back but then lost the Big One.
Yeah, that was a shocker. Another reason I don't like NFL much anymore. New England and all their cheating.
I don't think that's anything new.
Maybe not, but I guess all the money in it changes things. One reason I prefer college ball these days.
I hear you, but watching college ball looks a lot like watching high school ball. Not as professional.
Haha. I like high school ball! Those 70-3 score games are a hoot.
Except nowadays that's considered bad form and they put the 5th string in after the lead hits about 30.
Can't upset the precious snowflakes;)
