Have you hear of John Legend?
Yeah. I know  and like his music.
Did you know he co-wrote "I Want You" with Janet Jackson?
Cool! I did not know that.
It was certified Platinum and received a nomination for Best Female R&B Vocal Performance at the 47th Annual Grammy Awards too.
That is no surprise! They are both great music artists.
I totally agree!
Legend's debut album, 2004's Get Lifted, went platinum as well.
Legend made his film debut in "Loverboy"

I believe he started singing in a church choir.
Yep, at age 4. Then he started piano at age 7.
