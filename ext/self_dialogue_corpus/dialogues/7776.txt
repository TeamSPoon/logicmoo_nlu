Do you think actor who played Harry Potter looked like what you imagined Harry Potter to look like?
No he didn't to me. I grew to like him but he got kind of weird looking as he got older.
I thought so too. I liked Rupert Grint for Ron but he didn't look anything like Ron from the books.
Yeah, he was supposed to have a long skinny nose and be very lanky. That kid was not that but he fit pretty well.
What about the Weasley twins....not what I expected either.
No, but it was okay. I think they were under utilized as characters in the movie and the books.
I would have liked to see more of them too. They were great characters.
I liked that they were good natured pranksters. Who couldn't like them?
I know, I think they could caused more havoc when the deatheaters took over the school.
Yeah, but remember they were gone by then. Doing the joke shop thing but they came back to join the fray when the time was right.
