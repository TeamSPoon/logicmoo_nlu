Do you like the music from Twin Peaks?
Love it. Who does it again?
Angelo Badalamenti.
Right! He's great.
Very little of it in the new show though.
I noticed that. What was that jazz song during the breakfast scene?
Take Five.
Dave Brubeck Quartet.
Maybe. It might have been a different version.
The songs at the end are good.
The Au Revoir Simone one was my favorite.
Me too!
The percussionist looked like Ronette Pulaski.
I didn't notice that.
You should look if you watch it again.
I will.
Who was the band at the end of the pilot?
Chromatics.
I don't remember the song title.
Me either.
