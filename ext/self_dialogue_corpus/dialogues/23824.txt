Have you ever seen the Psycho remake?
No. Who did it?
Gus van Sant. He did a shot by shot remake of Psycho.
Who did the original?
Alfred Hitchcock, in 1960.
When was the remake?
1998. It was in color. Plus it wasn't an exact shot by shot remake, though pretty close.
Is it any good?
It's interesting. He changed a couple of things, but it's worth seeing. It's like a film school project, almost.
What did he change?
He added a few flash frames to the murder scenes. Plus Norman Bates masturbates in this one.
Hitchcock didn't have him do that, then?
Er, no.
Who was in it?
Vincent Vaughn was Norman Bates, and Anne Heche played Marion Crane?
Were they any good?
Vincent Vaughn was OK. I didn't like Heche. I thought she was too ditzy.
Yeah, I don't like her much.
Still, you should check it out. Especially if you know the original well.
Thanks. I might well do that.
