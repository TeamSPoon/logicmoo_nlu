Okay, which of the two new Star Wars fillms out do you like better? Force Awakens or Rogue One?
Rogue One, definitely
Why is that?
Becuase it's closer to the Stars Wars I grew up with and fills in a fairly unexplored part of the Star Wars universe.
Yeah, I mean the capture of the Second Death Star plans was expanded upon with SHadows of the Empire, but not the frist Death Star plans.
Yes, and I liked the fact that the thermal exhaust port vulnerability wasn't an oversite, but a subtle piece of sabotage.
Yeah, that was a nice touch.
Truly it was a very nice touch.
Force Awakens is still very good, though
I'm not saying it was bad, just that I liked Rogue One better.
