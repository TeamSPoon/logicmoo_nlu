Have you seen Captain America?
Yes why do you ask?
I was considering watching it for the first time, is it any good?
You haven't seen it?
No not yet sadly.
Then you best clear your schedule because Captain America is glorious, it's set in a time actually i'll just let you enjoy it.
At least tell me something.
Alright so Captain America is a man who was signing up for world war 2 and he was given the opportunity to try a new experiment.
Go on.
So he did and this super soldier serum if you will made him into a super soldier and he's pretty much a super hero.
