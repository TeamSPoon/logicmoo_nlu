What was that movie with Emma Stone in it?
La La Land?
Oh no.  The one where she was a teenager in high school.
I think you mean Easy A.
Yes!  That's the one!
It was pretty darn underrated and funny.
It kind of put her on the map a bit as well.
She definitely elevated her status in that movie.  It was a cut above the other teen movies.
Too bad she's like 40 years old now.
Wow, you are way offbase.
