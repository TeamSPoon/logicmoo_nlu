Have you seen Scream?
Maybe?  That thriller movie from the 90s?
Yes!  With the guy in the ghost mask.
I think I have but its been a long time.  Who is in it?
Drew Berrymore, Neve Campbell, Courtney Cox, Rose McGowan.
Oh yeah.  And David Arquette, right?
Yes!  I love that movie.
I thought it was okay.
It is one of my favorites!  It was so hard to figure out who the killers were.
Yeah - that part was definitely cool.
