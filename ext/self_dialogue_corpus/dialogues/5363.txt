Did you hear they're finally making a new "Incredibles" movie?
Oh, great!  I love that one.  It's a long time between the original and the sequel.
I know.  Hopefully it will be worth the wait.
Mr. Incredible is the best.
What about Frozone?  That scene where he says "Honey, where's my super suit"?
Hysterical.  The way his wife answers is the super funny.
Is Syndrome going to be the villain?
I have no idea.  Wasn't he killed in the first movie?
Will the kids be the same age do you think, or grown up?
I don't know.  Maybe Jack-Jack will be in high school or something.
