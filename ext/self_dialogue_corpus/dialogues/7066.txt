Have you seen 'Frozen'?
Thankfully not - I'm sick of hearing that 'Let It Go' song everywhere.
I know how you feel. It's crazy Disney is still making hits, though.
Disney is timeless. You can still watch an older Disney movie and it stands up to the test of time.
I watched 'Beauty and the Beast' for the first time since I was a kid and the animation is gorgeous.
It's amazing what they were able to do decades ago, and it still looks beautiful.
'Alice in Wonderland' is still an amazing feat of animation.
That's definitely one of my favorite Disney movies. The scene with the Queen of Hearts and all the cards is so scary!
I remember feeling claustrophobic and panicky when I saw that scene as a kid.
Me too. Disney movies just really stand up to the test of time, in my opinion.
