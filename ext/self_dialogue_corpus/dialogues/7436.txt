I agree, the songs became very catchy!
Have you been on the Frozen ride in Disney?
Yes! We loved it, well worth the wait!
You are right, with the songs and the ride I don't think anyone will forget Ana and Elsa.
Don't forget the Clothing and the Dolls!!
Of course not!
Which one does your daughter relate to more? Sammy loves Ana
So funny! Kinz loves Elsa.
I wonder what Frozen 2 will be about?
Maybe their children.....
