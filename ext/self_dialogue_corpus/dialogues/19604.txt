So what kind of music do you listen to?
I'll listen to anything, really.
As long as it's a good song, right?
Exactly.
I'm the same way. I'll listen to anything from classical to rap music.
I don't usually listen to the radio that much, though.
Same here. Lately, I've actually been listening to a little heavy metal.
There are so many kinds. Which kind do you mean?
Nothing to dark or heavy. Mostly those old hair bands from back in the day.
Oh, do you mean those old bands like Metallica from the '80s?
Exactly! Do you listen to that stuff at all?
Sometimes; not usually, though.
You're not really a heavy metal fan?
Oh, I like it. I've just been listening to stuff like Rage Against the Machine when I want to listen to something loud.
I love Rage.
Yeah. It's a shame they're not together anymore,
Some of them got together last summer for a collaboration project.
Yes. They toured with someone from Public Enemy, I believe.
None of it's the same without the frontman Zack.
I agree. He was really the sound of Rage Against the Machine.
