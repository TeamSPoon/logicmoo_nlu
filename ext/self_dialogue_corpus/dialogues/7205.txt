what did you think of inside out
it was a brilliant movie
Pixar can do no wrong
they just do things so cleverly
they think outside the box
who else would make a movie like that?
a lot of companies but they stand a lone in how they do it.
they make the characters so well too
they end up so likable
they are the best at what they do
