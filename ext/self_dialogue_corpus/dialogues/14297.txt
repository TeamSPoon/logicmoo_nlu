Do you know a lot about basketball?
Yeah but not the NBA
What do you watch then?
Usually college basketball
Do you have a favorite team?
Yeah, I am a huge fan of BYU
That team is not very good!
We don't win many championships, true, but we are still good!
I like UCLA, because we win a lot of championships.
That's not the only reason to like a team though!
Why not?
You should like the school, the players, the coach, etc
I don't know anything about the players anymore but I used to!
Why do you say that?
I like them because I went to UCLA! I dont know anything anymore though
Oh I see. So that's why you like them so much!
Yeah, I used to even have classes with the players, so that was cool.
Awesome! I like BYU because I know Jimmer!
Who is that?
He was a great player a couple years ago, he could hit really long 3 pointers!
