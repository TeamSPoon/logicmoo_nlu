Do you like Pixar movies?
I don't know. What Pixar movies can you think of?
I like A Bug's Life and Cars and that one about the rat cooking in France.
Oh, yeah. I remember that last one. It was Ratatouille!
Yeah, that's the one. Did you see it?
Yeah, I saw Ratatouille back when I lived in Georgia.
Didn't you think the animation was beautiful?
Yes, I remember that now that you mention it. It had a kind of soft feel to it, and the views of Paris were something.
It was a little over the top to imagine a rat controlling the movements of the human cook, wasn't it?
I guess so, but it was still fun.
Yeah, I thought so. I liked the first Cars movie too, did you see that one?
I think so, was that the one with the race car that got lost out in the desert or something?
Yes, he got lost in an old town along Route 66 at the time when they were building the new Interstate and everyone was bypassing the town.
And that was Owen Wilson that did the voice of Lightning McQueen, wasn't it?
Yeah. Lightning had to learn a lesson from the townspeople, or townscars, I guess you'd have to call them.
That's funny, you're right. Did you see the movie with the snail that races?
Oh, yeah, what was that called?
It was called Turbo.
Yeah, I saw that one too. It was kind of fun.
I guess I do like some of the animated movies now that we're talking about them.
