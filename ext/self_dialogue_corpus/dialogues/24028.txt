Have you seen any good action movies lately?
Not for a while.
What is the last good one you saw?
I really like the Smoking Aces movies.
I like those as well.
The first one is far better than the second.
I agree.
What is your favorite assassin group in the first one?
I like the brothers that drive around  in the car.
Yeah, they are crazy.
What is your favorite group.
I think I like the guy that impersonates Bertolli.
He is scary.
He sure is.
What is your favorite scene in the movie?
I like when the lady is shooting the large sniper rifle through the windows.
That part is gnarly.
What is your favorite?
I think mine would be when they are all in the hotel room at the very end.
That part has a lot of action.
