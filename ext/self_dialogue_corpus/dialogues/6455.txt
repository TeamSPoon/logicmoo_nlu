Have you seen the new Beauty and the Beast movie? You should, with the kids.
Did you like it?
I did, it was a wonderful remake.
You're not the first person who has told me that.
The effects were stunning and Emma Watson is a wonderful actress.
I think I'll buy it for my kids the next time we go out.
Definitely one of those movies you're going to want to keep around.
I kept all of my Disney movies my whole childhood.
Same with me, I think my parents still have a few down in the basement.
I'm excited, this was a remake I was very excited about. Nice to hear they did it the right way!
