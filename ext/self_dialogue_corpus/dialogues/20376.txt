I really want to see the new Wonder Woman movie.
Really? I am not a fan of superhero movies.
What? Are you insane?
They have just never interested me.
Don't tell me that you didn't like Christian Bale as Batman.
Eh. He was okay.
What about Tobey Maguire as Spiderman?
I wouldn't watch the Spiderman movies if you paid me.
Okay, last time. What about Chris Evans as Captain America?
Hm. I don't think I've ever watched any of those.
There's still a chance that I can change your mind about superhero movies, then.
Oh, I don't think so.
Fine. What is your favorite movie genre?
I love dramas.
Seriously? Those are so boring.
No way. Seeing the vast range of human emotion displayed on screen is amazing.
Okay okay. What movies would you recommend?
I would recommend The Help. It is very dramatic, but there are also some very funny scenes throughout.
That's the movie with Octavia Spencer and Viola Davis, right?
That's right. Octavia won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for that film.
