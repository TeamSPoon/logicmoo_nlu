Are you a fan of Jodeci from the 90s?
I absolutely loved Kci and Jo Jo. That was my group.
They had a string of hits back in the day.
Love you for Life is definitely one of my favorites from them.
Did you know Devante actually wrote and produced all of those songs?
I had no idea. He's really talented in that case.
Kci and JoJo went solo for a while but that didn't really last long.
Yeah I think we all liked them better as a group.
Kci and Mary J Blige were a couple for a while when they first came out.
Right they were all under Bad Boy under P Diddy at the beginning.
That's when the music was great. It's not the same as it used to be.
Do you remember when Mary and Jodeci came out on The Arsenio Hall show?
Wow that is so old school. I remember that show, they were on there with Stevie Wonder.
Right and they sang You Will Know by Stevie together.
Right and Stevie was worried that they were going to mess up the lyrics.
Which they did. They put the first verse second and vice versa.
That was funny. They did a great job singing it together though.
I hope Jodeci comes out with a reunion show.
Me too. My Heart Belongs to You is my favorite of theirs.
They pretty much defined 90s era r&b if you ask me.
