Are you ready for the upcoming NFL season?
Are you kidding?  Less than two months til pre-season--can't wait!
Me neither, man.  I've been to a couple of open training camps.
Yeah, I've been to the Cowboys training camp in Oxnard myself earlier this year.
Autographs, cheerleaders and everything?
You bet. Man, you should see Dallas' passing game in practice.
Impressive?  With Romo gone, you gotta wonder will Prescott start.
You gotta wonder.  He reminds me of Theismann.
Those were the days!  Remember when NFL players were paid like regular people.
Ha!  My dad got Jethro Pugh's autograph at a sporting goods store where he worked in the off-season.
Times were sure different then.  I remember ol' 88 on the Cowboys Drew Pearson...
... was a sportscaster on a Dallas radio station!  Said he sure as heck wouldn't be doing that if he got paid like the kids today!
Speaking of old NFL players, I met a old dude yesterday whose dad sold cars to Doak Walker and Bobby Lane.
That IS speaking of old NFL... the golden age of the NFL.
Dandy Don and Hollywood--
Henderson?  You know he won the Texas lottery twice after he retired.
Do you always think of Dallas?  I was referring to Hollywood Joe Willy Namath.
Well, you mentioned Don Meredith so I thought you were still talking Cowboys, yo.
I could, you know. I could go on and on about any team in the NFL.
But the Cowboys are your favorite! Have a good night.
