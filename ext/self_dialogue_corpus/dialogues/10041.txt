Do you like any Bruce Lee movies?
Of course, I'm a huge fan. I love all of them!
What's your favorite Bruce Lee movie?
Oh that's definitely Enter the Dragon.
For me it's Fists of Fury. That black and yellow suit is the same one Uma Thurman wore in Kill Bill.
I know, that was a great homage. It's crazy that his son was killed almost the same way he was.
I know, that was very tragic too. He was a great fighter and great person all around.
I love martial arts movies but he's my favorite star. Have you seen the movies about his master?
You mean Ip Man? Yes those movies were great too, great storyline and background.
My father turned me on to Martial Arts movies when I was young and I haven't stopped watching since.
