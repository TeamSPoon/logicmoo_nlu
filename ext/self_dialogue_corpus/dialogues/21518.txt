What's your favorite Sandra Bullock movie?
I think I'm going to have to go with Hope Floats.
Is that the one where she has to movie back to Texas with her daughter?
Yes! After she finds out that her husband was cheating on her.
Her mother is a real character in that movie, right?
Yeah, everyone is pretty eccentric. It's great.
I just remember when she danced with Harry Connick Jr. at a picnic or BBQ.
It was such a romantic moment!
Do they get together in the end?
It's complicated for a little while, but they do eventually.
It reminds me of Sweet Home Alabama with Reese Witherspoon.
Yeah, it definitely follows a romantic comedy formula.
But it's so much fun anyway!
Yes, both movies really are lots of fun.
I love romantic comedies when they are set in the south.
I know! It's such a relief from all of the ones that take place in NYC or California.
A good setting makes a movie much more enjoyable.
That is seriously true.
And both Reese and Sandra are southern anyway, so they really pull it off.
You're right, they do!
