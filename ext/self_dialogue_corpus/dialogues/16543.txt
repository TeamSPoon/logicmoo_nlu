What do you think of Bjork?
I used to listen to her music and quite enjoyed it, but haven't kept up on her latest stuff.
Oh, cool. I really like her style. She's quite innovative and has a beautiful voice.
Yes, her voice is beautiful--as is she! I like that she has so much control over her music.
Agreed! When you hear a Bjork song you are getting something very personal in a way--it's not like she's just singing the songs but they've been written and produced by others.
Usually that's true. Though I'm pretty sure she's done at least one cover. Anyway I kind of lost interest in her music after Vespertine.
I continued to like her music after that. I like how she keeps reinventing her style. Her music videos are also quite brilliant and innovative.
True. I like how she changes her appearance a lot.
And she is always experimenting with new techniques! I hear she has gotten into virtual reality lately.
Oh really? You mean she's making virtual reality videos, or is she actually performing live in VR?
360 videos I think. I haven't seen any yet but I'm looking forward to it.
Have you seen/heard much music in VR, then?
A fair amount. It's quite interesting being surrounded by a whole seen, like for example being in the middle of the band performing, or having a music video happening all around you.
It seems like it would be a natural match for electronic dance music
Yes, definitely. I saw an abstract video for a Lindsey Stirling song in virtual reality.
Oh, she's interesting--her blend of techno music and classic music is quite brilliant.
For sure. I'd love to see her live, but haven't had the chance. Then again I don't like crowds much, so...
I was at a rave that played a lot of her music.
Well, that is a natural venue for Stirling!
I was certainly in the right frame of mind to appreciate her groove.
