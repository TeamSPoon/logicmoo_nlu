Lady Gaga's music videos are such art.
I know, it's crazy how she can come up with these ideas.
No one does it like her.
The video for Paparazzi was pure perfection.
I loved the stuff she did with Beyonce.
Yes!  Video Phone and Telephone were legendary videos!
We're going to look back on all of her stuff and compare her to Micheal Jackson.  She's that great!
She's way better than Madonna, that's for sure.
And Mariah Carey.  Gaga is in a league of her own.
I'm forever a fan.
