I love the Spice Girls Movie.
Me too! Everytime I watch it it takes me back to when I was a little kid.
I know. I love all the cameos in the movie.
It's so funny how their tour bus driver was the singer Meat Loaf.
I love when their rushing down the hall, and they all give Elton John a kiss.
Haha. He was in such a daze after that, and he had lipstick all over his face.
I think the funniest character in that movie is Clifford.
It's so hilarious how uptight he is.
And his boss never gives him a straight answer only adding to his stress.
Yep, that movie is awesome.
I can't believe the low rating it has on Rotten Tomatoes.
Me either. It was great for what it was.
Exactly. I don't know what the critics were expecting.
I don't know either.
I thought the use of their music in the movie was seamless.
I agree. I love when Baby Spice is telling the male dancer about her stuffed animals in between singing.
That part was so funny.
It's also funny when Posh Spice doesn't know which little black dress to wear.
It's so nice how the movie managed to capture all their different personalities.
I know. I feel like I know them after watching the movie.
