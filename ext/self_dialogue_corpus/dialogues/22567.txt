John Wayne was my dad's favorite actor. I grew up watching a whole lot of John Wayne movies.
He was a classic movie star, I think.
Some people disparaged him, saying he couldn't act, but I don't agree at all.
What do you think were some of his best roles?
His showiest role was as Rooster Cogburn in True Grit, the film for which he won the Oscar, finally.
He had been nominated before, right?
Yes. I think the win for True Grit was a win for his entire filmography at that point, but it was still well deserved.
He had just beaten cancer at that point. I think Hollywood understood that he was a treasure of the industry.
I think one of his best acted roles was in The Quiet Man.
Interesting, since it wasn't one of his many Westerns.
This one was about an ex-boxer escaping his tragic past by going to his roots in Ireland, and falling in love with a bold Irish lass.
Who was played by the quintessential Irish lass, Maureen O'Hara.
They made a great team in that film, because they were both such strong characters and personalities.
And that film had one of the best fights ever - going through the entire town before they ended it by shaking hands. Iconic!
I have a lot of favorite John Wayne Westerns, but I think Rio Bravo would be in the top 2 or 3.
That one had such a great cast - Angie Dickenson, Dean Martin, Walter Brennan, and even Ricky Nelson.
I could watch that one over and over. Great writing and dialogue, lots of suspense, great music.
There's another non-Western that he was great in - Hatari, set in Africa.
That's a great one too. Red  Buttons as the sidekick.
And don't forget "The Baby Elephant Walk," which became a classic song. Great John Wayne movie.
