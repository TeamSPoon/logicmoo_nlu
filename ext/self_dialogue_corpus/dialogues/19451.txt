I don't understand new music sometimes.
What are you talking about? 'New music'?
For example, you remember when like 10 years back dubstep became huge?
Uh huh. It took a few years to really catch on, but yeah, it was the pretty hot thing for a while.
Well, for me, I didn't understand any of it. I didn't get the appeal, and I didn't like it.
Maybe it just wasn't to your taste? Or maybe you're getting old?
It's not just dubstep though, it's lots of new musical styles. Take vaporwave for example.
What's wrong with vaporwave?
I don't understand it. I even tried looking it up, and I found out vaporwave evolved from seapunk, witch house, and chillwave.
Shoot, that's not even getting into sub-genres of vaporwave like hardvapour or Simpsonwave which is more of a visual experience.
See, that proves my point! I don't know what's going on with modern music!
I think people simply like things like vaporwave because it's an alternative to the hyper-manufactured pop-styling you get in the Top 40 on the radio.
But isn't that the point of alternative radio stations?
Alternative is basically just bunch of  Foo Fighters or Coldplay inspired bands who aren't popular enough to hit it big, but aren't original enough to stand out.
That's pretty harsh. Then what do you consider to be regular rock?
'Rock' basically just refers to post-grunge nowadays, like Nickelback or again, Foo Fighters, with a bit of 'rap-rock' thrown in.
Rap-rock? What constitutes as that?
You know, like Linkin Park. It's basically radio friendly standard rock music, but with a few rap verses thrown in here and there.
Point made. Still, even if a lot of that music is unoriginal and pretty derivative, at least I understand it, unlike vaporwave.
True, even I don't see the point of things like Nightcore. I guess there's a place for both kinds of music, though.
