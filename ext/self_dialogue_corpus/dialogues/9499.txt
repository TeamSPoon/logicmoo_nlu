Who is your favorite rapper?
I love Eminem.
Lame. My favorite is Drake.
That's even lamer than Eminem!
At least I didn't say Macklemore!
True. Do you like any older rappers?
No I don't like any of the classics. I like the newer artists.
I think Common was awesome.
Yeah. He was! I forgot about him.
I need to listen to more Common now.
