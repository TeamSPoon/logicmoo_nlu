I want to watch an action movie that will make me think.
Are you a fan of Guy Ritchie?
I loved the movie Snatch.
He made a great movie called Revolver.
That sounds interesting, is it about a gun?
Not quite. There are definitely guns but it is more about enlightenment if you read between the lines.
How do they manage that?
The movie is about a man discovering that his ego controls him.
That sounds intense. How does he resolve this?
He goes to his biggest enemy and apologizes to him.
