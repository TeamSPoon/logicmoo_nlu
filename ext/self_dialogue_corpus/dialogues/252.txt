What's your favorite Marvel movie?
I'm a big fan of Thor.
Thor is a pretty great superhero. He's kind of stereotypical but also funny.
His banter with Robert Downey Jr. in the Avengers is great.
I love everyone in the avengers, even Hawkeye.
Hawkeye is so under-appreciated.
He's got skills with those arrows when they kill the aliens though.
Wouldn't it be great if they made a Hawekeye movie! Or a Black Widow movie?
That would be great. Representation is important.
Yes, and you can still make good movies. Black Panther looks like it could be the best Marvel movie yet.
