What was that movie with Jack Nicholson at the hotel?
I think you are referring to The Shining.
Right, the Stephen King movie.
Man, that was creepy.  Bleeding walls, twin girls.
Full of tons of cool things.  Probably one of the greatest quotes ever with 'Here's Johnny!'
Fun fact: did you know that was improvised?
Oh really?  Didn't know that.
Yep, Jack made it up on the fly after he smashed the door.
That's cool.  I never realized that and it makes me respect him a bit more.
He probably has more of a comedic touch than you would normally think.
