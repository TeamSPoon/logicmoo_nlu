The Houston Astros are smoking hot right now!
Yeah they have won 9 out of their last 10 games.
The Astros have the best record in baseball.
Yeah they are winning about 70% of their games right now.
I didn't see this coming at all. I figured they would be pretty good, but they are dominating teams
Yeah right now they are 7 1/2 games in front of the Rangers
Yeah they have won 4 straight games.
This could be a championship season for the Astros.
Wouldn't that be crazy. It seems weird that they are a legitimate title contender
Yeah it is a little weird to see them where they are right now.
But let's not get ahead of ourselves. It is still early in the season.
True. You don't want to jump the gun because there are so many games left.
True. But when I look at the American League West, I don't see anyone contesting them.
Me neither. They may coast in the division all year.
Yeah for sure, but their challenge is the Yankees
Yeah the Yankees are their competition this year. To me, they are the frontrunners in the American League
Yeah, but I hate the Yankees, I wouldn't mind the Astros getting to the World Series
Truthfully, anyone but the Yankees!
Yeah maybe the Astros can pull it off. They have to believe in themselves.
That's the key, especially for an organization that's not used to winning.
