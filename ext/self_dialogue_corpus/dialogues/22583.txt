Hello Waldo, have you seen any good kids movies recently?
Oh hi, Vladimir, as a matter of fact I have.
What did you see?
I saw Cars 3 with my kids a couple of weeks ago.
How was it?
It was really good actually!
Better than Cars 2
Yeah, it was.  It got back to the spirit of the original Cars movie.
That's good, my four year old wants to see it.  Do you think he'll like it?
He'll love it, and you probably will too.
That's good to know.
I enjoyed trying to figure out who was doing the voices on the cars.
I do that a lot with cartoons too.
Nathan Fillion from Firefly was one of the voices.  I knew I recognized the voice, but didn't figure it out myself until after the movie.
Oh, I bet that drove you nuts.
It did.  I wanted to get out my phone and look it up.
But you were good and waited until after the movie?
Of course, I can't be rude during a movie.
I'm glad you have good movie manners.
Thanks dude, I'll talk to you later!
