Are you fan of Wes Craven movies?
I liked Scream. Did he do anything else?
Oh for sure. Nightmare on Elm Street
Is that the one with the claws on the hand
Yes, Freddy Krueger
yeah, I remember seeing him in a lot of promos back in the day
Yes, he was part of teenager's nightmares that would become reality
Wow, sounds pretty far out
Yes, some of the early ones were very weird and disturbing to watch.
Hmm...not sure if I can watch something like that.
