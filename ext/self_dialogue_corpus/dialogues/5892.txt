How many remakes of the Disney movies do you think they will make?
Like, into live action ones?
Yes, from the cartoon.
Well, Cinderella did not do to well.
Beauty and the Beast did ..
I know they were doing a Little Mermaid one.
I think the actress they wanted back out.
I heard they are doing a Lion King one too.
That will just be Hamlet then, if it does not have Lions.
Lion King is based on Hamlet.
