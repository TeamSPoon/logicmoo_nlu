Do you like rock n roll music?
A little bit. I like some of the older rock n roll music more than the newer stuff.
What kinds of rock n roll bands do you like?
I loved Aerosmith when they were in their prime.
Oh yeah, Aerosmith was the best way back when.
I still listen to their music. What rock n roll bands do you like?
I really like The Rolling Stones and Led Zeppelin.
Do you see what I mean? The older rock n roll bands are the better ones.
There are still some good rock n roll bands playing today.
Like who?
Have you ever heard of Radiohead or Imagine Dragons?
No I haven't heard of either one.
What about Greenday? They still play and they are great.
That's true. I do like Greenday.
U2 is a good band too, I love their music.
I don't really like U2. They take rock n roll into a more a pop direction.
Some of their stuff does have an upbeat pop sound.
Yeah, I don't like that too much.
You will have to give Radiohead and Imagine Dragons a listen and let me know what you think.
I will! I'll get back to you soon about it.
