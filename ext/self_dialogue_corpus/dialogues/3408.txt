Do you like those horror flicks that are actually silly?
Do you mean the spoofs?
Yes.
Some of them are OK but others are lame.
I haven't seen many actually.
I've seen all the Scary Movie ones.
I saw one. Parts of it were funny.
We saw the third one together, right?
Yes, a few months ago when Josie rented it.
That's right. It made fun of Scream and other ones.
