How many Star Wars movies are there?
I would have to say 8, including The Force Awakens and Rogue One.
I've seen two of them. Revenge of the Sith and Attack of the Clones.
So you've never seen any of the ones from the 70's?
No but I've been making it a point to watch them. What's your favorite of the originals?
I'd have to say Return of the Jedi. That's when things got real.
Oh yeah? Well is it necessary for me to watch them in chronological order?
I would say that's your best bet so that it flows seamlessly for you. The storyline I mean.
Oh ok. Is it true that James Earl Jones does the voice of Darth Vader?
Yes! He's such a great voice actor. One of the greatest of our time.
