There are a couple teams this year that could really make some noise.
Yea, a few seem to be on the decline.
What do you think about Philly?
Uhhh, I'm not sure. I think they have a a quarterback.
You like Wentz?
Man, that guy is a stud.
Yea, as long as they have playmakers around him, they will win.
Yea, last year, nobody could catch the ball.
Well, Alshon Jeffrey should solve some of that problem.
Yea, him and Torrey Smith were nice additions.
Yea, that with Ertz over the middle. Very nice!
Don't forget about their defense either. Fletcher Cox can ruffle some feathers.
Yea, he better do that or their secondary is going to get torched.
Yea, thats a major weakness. They have to figure that out.
Yea, I can't name one player on their secondary.
Come to think of it, I can't name any of their cornerbacks.
They do have a couple of great safeties, but time will tell if that is enough.
Yea, I don't know if even that will be enough.
Yea, well if they can get some pressure on the quarterback consistently, it just may.
You are right. We will find out.
