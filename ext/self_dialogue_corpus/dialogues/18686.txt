I was checking out Spotify to find some new music to listen to. I found some really great songs from RuPaul!
I never paid much attention to his music before but its been getting more popular now so I listened to some. I was really impressed.
Have you heard Low by Todrick Hall? RuPaul is featured in it.
Yes! It is so good, I love dancing to it.
I love finding new stuff but I'm also still a huge fan of Radiohead. I'll never stop loving their music.
Me too. I've always liked Fallout Boy and their new stuff is good too.
They went for quite a while without releasing anything new but it seems pretty steady now.
Yes, there is a new artists I really like right now. The Cactus Blossoms.
Yes I like them too. I also like Christopher Gallant.
Do you know who will always be one of my favorites? Flo-Rida.
No doubt, I love "My House" just as much as I loved "Whistle."
There's a new group I just started hearing about recently that is pretty good. I checked them out because their name is "Cabbage" and I really liked their stuff.
I've heard of them. A fairly new group I like is "Twenty One Pilots."
Yes they are alright. Some of their lyrics are very thought provoking.
That is what I like about them, but I also like the lyrics from many songs off of Panic! At the Disco's new album.
I love them. I saw them live and it was amazing.
I'm sure it was. The best live performance I ever saw was Three Days Grace.
I've never been to one of their concerts and I heard they lost their lead vocalist. Is that true?
Adam Gontier left the group. It won't be the same now, but sometimes groups can recover from losing someone.
That's true. I will wait and see what they can do without him before I decide.
