Did you hear the latest Rise Against?
No how bad was it?
It was a departure from their normal stuff thats for sure.
Ever since Counter Song they have really gone downhill
They stopped focusing on their lead singers voice
Yeah and chilled out with the aggressive tones.
I liked how great they sounded for a long time
They knew how to make political statements without sounding bad.
Yeah and thats one of the reasons I listened to them.
I agree, I wish they would go back to that song.
What was your favorite song by them
I loved Give it All
The video for that song got you pumped up.
What was yours?
I loved every track on Revolutions per Minute
So you dont have a favorite track?
No not really, like I said I loved an entire album
Thats interesting, have you seen them live?
Yes and they were very emotional.
I wish they still could have that emotion in their songs
