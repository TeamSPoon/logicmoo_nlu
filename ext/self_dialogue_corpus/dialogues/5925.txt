Did you hear they are making a new Incredibles movie?
Yes, I did.  I think the movies where Disney works with Pixar are the best.
I think so too.  Finding Dory was great.
I hope they continue making really good sequels for Disney movies. Sometimes kids movies have terrible sequels.
I thought they did well with Monsters University.
I liked that one too.  Cars 2 was terrible.
They're making a new Cars movie too.
Really?  I hope its better than the last one.
The previews for it look pretty good but I think they've kind of beaten that one to death.
I'll just wait until that one comes to dvd to see it.
