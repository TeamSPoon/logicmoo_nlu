Hey, what's going on with you?
Nothing much. Just bored out of my mind.
I don't see how you can be bored, especially with the invention of music.
Ha, ha. Lately, all these music artists sound the same.
How could you say such a thing? (feigns shock)
It's true. Who can you say is different from the rest?
Beyonce.
Ok, you have a point. I don't really listen to her though.
Hence the fact of your boredom.
Is she that great? You're driving a hard promotion here.
Are you kidding me? Beyonce has changed my life for the better.
How can a celebrity affect you in such a great way?
All of her albums speak life into me, especially Lemonade.
Isn't that the one about a tumultuous relationship and how she overcame it?
Yes, exactly! What gal can't relate?
You have a point there too. (smiles)
See there, Beyonce has already made you smile and you have yet to press play.
Thanks for the info. I'll check her music out.
Thank me in concert tickets to see her one day.
We'll see... (Winks)
