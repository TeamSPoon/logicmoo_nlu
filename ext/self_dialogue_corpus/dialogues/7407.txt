I think Inside Out is Disney's deepest movie yet.
Why do you think that?
Well, it looks at all the human emotions and puts a classic disney twist on it.
That's true, but what about the movie The Chronicles of Narnia.
Why was that movie deep?
Well there were tons of symbols in that movie that everyone was talking about.
Yeah I guess maybe that could be a prett deep movie as well.
It might even have more symbols that Inside Out!
Maybe we should watch the both of them again. What do you think?
Sure, how about tonight?
