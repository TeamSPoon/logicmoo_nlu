Is Peyton Manning the greatest QB ever?
No I think he cant win that one now
Why not?
Not enough Super Bowl wins
So theres a set amount?
To be the greatest ever, yes.
So Brady eclipsed him by 2004?
It looks like that now.
But what about all the yards he racked up?
Just numbers at this point and not enough to grant him the best ever.
He still is a surefire Hall of Famer!
Yeah thats true.
I think his Denver years were alright though
That last year wasnt all that good.
Brady has been doing it consistently.
Right and both lost a year to an injury.
OK So we have to say Brady is the best, right?
Yeah, if you want a QB for one game you want Brady
Strange because Manning could dice you apart.
He could unless it was in a playoff game
