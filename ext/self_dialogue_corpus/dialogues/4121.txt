No Country for Old Men was a weird movie.
Weird?  Not the word I'd use.
Well, by that I mean it's creepy.  I'm not sure I get it.
You mean the ending where he's talking to his wife?
No, before that where the villain guy is talking to his wife.
Yeah, he flipped a quarter and killed her.
How do you know she's dead?
After he's done, he looks at this shoes.  That's a tell that there may have been blood on that.
I never noticed that.
You should watch it again to see what I mean.
