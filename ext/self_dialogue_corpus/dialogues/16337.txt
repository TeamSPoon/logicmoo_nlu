Did you heard that Radiohead is releasing a reissue of Ok Computer?
No, I didn't know. Wow, that's really exciting!
I know. Its going to be called , OK Computer OKNOTOK 1997 2017.
Is there going to be any new tracks on it?
Yes, they're putting out 3 previously unreleased tracks, along with a bunch of b-sides.
That's really great news.
I think so. I thought they were done after Moon Shaped Pool.
Me too. What did you think of Moon Shaped Pool anyways?
It wasn't my favorite, but I liked it for what it was. A Radiohead album.
So any new music by Radiohead is better than no music?
Not exactly. I think I just keep waiting for OK Computer Radiohead.
I thought A Moon Shaped Pool was really good.
To me, it felt more like a novelty album than anything else.
What do you mean a novelty album?
I feel like they played a lot of games with it, deleting the website, sending out the singles, it just didn't feel like Radiohead to me.
I can understand why you would feel that way. Do you think the 3 new tracks will be like that?
No, I don't think so. Since they're previously unreleased, I'm hoping that they are from when Radiohead first got started.
I think in any case, its great that they're releasing new tracks and touring again.
I agree with you. it feels like they're doing this for the die hard fans, so it should be really good.
I'm sure it will be, we'll just have to wait and see I guess.
