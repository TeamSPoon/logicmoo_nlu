You know what movie was both dumb and good at the same time?
What?
White chicks.
Yes!  It was stupid but it kind of gets away with it.
Yeah, lets hope there is no sequel.  It worked once, it shouldn't have but did.
You have to admit though Terry Cruz was awesome in that movie.
He always is.  He's a funny guy.
Yeah, he actually is.  You don't think of him as a comedian because of this size.
i know what you mean.  Most comedians are short and fat.
And he's tall and ripped.
That movie was just one dumb joke after another.
Seemed to put it together though.
I liked the shopping scene.
The part where Jennifer Carpenter was going nuts?
Yeah that was funny.
You know what else she was good in?
Both Dexter and Quarantine.
Yes, Quarantine was scary.
Have you ever seen Rec?
Yeah, it's like the same movie but in Spanish.
