Do you know what year Sleeping Beauty came out?
No, can't say that I do.
It came out in 1959.
Wow, I wasn't even born yet.
Me either.
I do like that one. It is a classic.
Yes, her parents were smart to hide her.
Most characters in their stories don't think of the worst.
Well guess it didn't matter anyway, did it?
No, but as usual it all works out in the end.
