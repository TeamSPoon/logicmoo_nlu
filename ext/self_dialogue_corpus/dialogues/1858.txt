What do you think is the strongest division in the NFL?
That is a tough question. I guess I'd have to think about it division by division.
Well, the AFC East is out. The Patriots are strong of course, but there's really nobody else.
Fair. I'd say the AFC North could be a contender with the Steelers, Ravens, and Bengals. We can forget about the Browns!
Poor Browns. The AFC South could be a contender in some years, but not lately.
I agree. I think next year we should see some good things from the AFC West with the Chiefs, Broncos, and Raiders.
When I think of the NFC, it seems like each division has a couple good teams and a couple bad ones.
I can see that, but I think the NFC East and NFC North are both difficult divisions.
Well, you can't underestimate the NFC West either with the Seahawks and Cardinals.
I know, but the other two are so bad!
Fair point. I feel the the NFC East and the AFC North have the biggest rivalries.
I'd agree with that. You have Vikings/Green Bay, but I don't feel like all four are rivals as much as the Giants, Cowboys, Eagles, and 'Skins.
Then you take the AFC East. Where are the rivalries?
Well, the Pats have been so dominant for so long that it is hard to have a rivalry.
Do they even have one at all?
If anyone, I guess the Giants because of the two Super Bowls, or maybe the Broncos, but that's about it.
I think you might be right with the Giants. Ruining a perfect season does tend to create some hard feelings.
I still can't talk about it.
Even with this year's amazing comeback.
Even with that. The 2007 loss still hurts!
