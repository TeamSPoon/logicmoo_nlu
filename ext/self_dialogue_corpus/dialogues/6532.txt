Have you ever watched Pinocchio?
You know I have not even heard about it.
It is a great story I highly recommend it!
I will have to look into watching it.
You should watch it soon, it has so many metaphors to life!
That sounds really interesting we should watch it today!
My favorite part is when Pinocchio finds himself in the really big... Oh never mind I do not want to spoil it for you!
Yeah seriously you know I hate movie spoilers!
I just can't believe you have never seen Pinocchio before that is crazy!
Well lets watch it now then!
