Michael Jackson was a gift.
Why you say that?
I'm watching the Remember The Time video.
Oh, that's one of my favorite jams.
That dude could dance, could sing, told a message with his music.
I know right. He's gone too soon.
This Remember The Time was off the chain my dude.
I like Rock My World.
I do too but that full version video is too long.
The song is tight though.
Yeah you right. I think I might listen to the Thriller album after this video goes off.
Do they have his full album on youtube?
They might but imma listen to the cd. I don't like all the commercials.
Yeah, you can't enjoy two or three songs in a row on there without a commercial.
It's close to midnight...
You got me wanting to hear some Mike my damn self.
Ain't nothing wrong with that. Didn't he die in June?
I think so.
As much music that he gave us, that makes all of June celebrate-Michael-Jackson month.
I know that's right.
