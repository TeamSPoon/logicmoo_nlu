Which movie do you think has the best soundtrack?
I don't know. There are so many like Lost Boys, Fifty First Dates and so many more.
How about musicals?
I like the songs from Carousel and Grease but that's it.
Not even the Disney movies?
I don't count those as musicals. Some of them are good.
I love the older ones from the 80's and 90's.
That's my favorite era, too. Most of the newer ones are too poppy.
I agree other than Moana.
That's funny. I like that soundtrack too but not the movie so much.
There are several movies I don't like as much as the soundtrack.
I feel that way about many newer movies. I just can't get into that.
Most of the newer kids' movies are annoying.
So annoying and even the music is in most of them.
My kids loved Frozen and it drove me nuts.
Ug, don't get me started.
Do you at least like Idina's singing voice?
No.
Neither do I. I hate that Let it Go song.
My kids love it.
