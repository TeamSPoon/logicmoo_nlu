What did  you think of the new Linkin park  track?
I thought it was solid   but missing  its original feel
What do you mean?
Well the vocals just  did not hit the same  was  as  tracks like in the  end .
Do you think some of the message  got lost  as well?
Some what  it did  seem  a little dumbed  down   ,
And it just did not have  the same punch to the  gut  right ?
Thats part of it   it just felt so  artistic now .
Would  you like to  see  them  go back to  their roots  more ?
Well even the  remix  they did  with Jay  seemed  very edgy at  the time .
I would   like  to  see  the orignial members  all come back  together myself .
I  think thats part of it  too the  chemistry is  just  kind of  off .
Would  you go see them perform  live  still?
Yeah I am sure   they still perform  amazing  live  and  I like  their older  stuff  still .
Who  do you think  should  open  for  them ?
I  think  a band  like  chevelle  or  hinder  would  sound  great with them .
I would  also like to hear some of the older  stuff  that did not make  the cd  cuts  .
I wonder  how much of that would be   hits .
I  am sure  we will  see them  get  better with time  again
I hope  so too
