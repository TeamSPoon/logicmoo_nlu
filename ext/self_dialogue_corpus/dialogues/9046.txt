In all honesty, do you think there's a definitive best rock band?
Who knows? In my opinion, it could come down to three options and no closer than that.
Which three?
Queen, the Beatles, and AC/DC.
Those are great choices, actually.
Right? Just think about it.
The Beatles are obviously one of the greatest music groups in history.
Then there's Queen, who helped bring rock music to the mainstream.
And AC/DC gave it the edge that spawned hard rock.
See? That's why it couldn't go any further.
