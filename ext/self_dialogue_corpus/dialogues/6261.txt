Did you watch the 1950 cinderella movie
Yes but I am afraid I little forgotten, could you please recall the character
Oh my goodness how can you forgot this movie characters, did you remember who is the leading actor in this movie
Yes I know, she is Helene Stanley but I doubt on the story line
Ok let me help you, In beginning Cinderella lives a miserable life as she lost her parents in her early age. Now did you catch something
Yes I know she was a very kind and gentle young woman but her stepsister were jealous I guess from her
Yes the stepsister were jealous because of her beauty but the Cinderella loves a prince you know?
Yes something I know that they wants to marry each other but there both are facing some difficulty, please tell me the climax
In the end both are happily married to each other
Yes now I remember how Cinderella fought and get the good results in the end.Thank you
