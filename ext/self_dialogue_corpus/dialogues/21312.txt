Have you seen "The Simpsons Movie"?
Yes, but I didn't think it was as good as the TV show episodes.
I agree, I think the storyline really failed the movie.
Maybe someday they will come out with a second Simpsons movie.
Do you like comedies?
I do! I recently saw "Baby Mama" and loved it!
That movie is hilarious. I love when the SNL stars get into a movie together. What part was your favorite?
I loved when they took the baby classes. And Dax Shepard's character was so funny!
Since you liked "Baby Mama" you must have liked "Mean Girls".
I do love "Mean Girls". I have watched it so many times I know it word for word.
Another SNL great. Lindsay Lohan isn't my favorite person or actress, but she did well in that film.
She did. I thought Rachel McAdams put on the best performance though. She was so snobby and cruel!
Did you see Rachel McAdams in "The Notebook"?
I haven't seen it, but have heard about it.
It's a great movie- very romantic, but there are some sad parts.
I'm not that crazy about romance films.
It was based on a book, I saw it a few years ago and loved it.
I'm looking forward to watching the new "Beauty and the Beast" move with Emma Roberts
It does look good. I haven't seen it yet but I want to.
It has already won some film awards.
