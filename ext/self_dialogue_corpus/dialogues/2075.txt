Who do you think is the top running back right now?
I think Leshon McCoy is the best right now talent wise.
Will the Bills ever make it back to the Super Bowl?
They'll need the right quarterback. They haven't had a good one in years.
Did you like the Super Bowl?
It was awful I can't believe James White was that good.
I think the Cowboys will own the NFC east.
They have good young stars, but the Giants always compete.
Who's your favorite receiver.
I like Julio Jones. He is a once in a lifetime player.
Can you believe Carr is the highest paid player ever?
That's crazy. Usually you have to win before they give you a huge contract.
Do you think the Giants will be any good?
Eli Manning is nearly past his prime.
Why won't Brady retire already?
I know. He's achieved everything he can.
The only thing Brady hasnt done is beaten the Giants in the super bowl.
I doubt he ever will. The Giants won't make it back.
Do you think Josh Gordon should be reinstated?
No he's had too many chances and blown them all.
