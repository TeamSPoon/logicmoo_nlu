Do you like U2?
Ummm, yeah. Is that even a question?
Well I don't know. Sometimes you never know.
I fell in love with them with Joshua Tree
Yeah, that's their classic iconic album.
Oh yeah. So many great songs.
With or Without You
Where the Streets Have No Name
Oh yeah, I love the whole album.
I heard they're going on tour again.
Yes, 30th anniversary of the release of Joshua Tree
Oh man, has it been that long?
Yeah, we're getting old man.
I never really got into their new stuff though.
Yeah, got a little too commercial after awhile.
Yeah, but still amazing that they could still produce.
Yes, that's true. Very impressive.
I'd like to go to another one of their concerts before they finally call it quits.
Yes, me too. Let's plan on it soon.
Yes, definitely.
