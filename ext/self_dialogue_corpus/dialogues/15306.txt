All these main stream artists are jumping on the dance music movement and sampling tracks from the underground scene. Have you noticed?
Like who?
Kanye sampled M.A.W. on his Pablo album.
Really I haven't heard it.
Yeah, and just recently Katy Perry sampled an old school classic from Roland Clark.
Which one?
They used "I get deeper" it sounds cool but you know how the scene gets about going mainstream.
Has there been any response from Roland about his vocals being sampled?
I haven't heard anything but I know he was supporting the track on social media.
That vocal is iconic in the scene. Hopefully Roland gets the credit he deserves for his work.
Dance music is so trendy now. It is the reincarnation of disco.
Dance comes from disco right? I love disco I don't know why it went out of style.
Disco was killed because of the culture and lifestyle that came with the music and that is why mainstream and the general population wanted it to end. Disco thrived in the underground and represented a world that was not safe to live among the general cookie cutter population.
Oh wow I didn't know that.
Yes, dance music as we know it today is the descendant of disco. Some would say it comes from Chicago house music when the Godfather of House Frankie Knuckles turned it all on it's head.
Oh I've heard of him.
Yes Frankie Knuckles was a major influencer and New York natives talk about Larry Levan and what is known as Garage music. All these sounds stem from the underground and are great influencers of what we now call dance music.
Who else sampled underground tracks?
Well Drake ruined a beautiful track by Black Coffee he not only sampled it but put another woman's vocals on it that sounds awful.
Haha that sounds about accurate. When mainstream gets it's hands on underground art they ruin it.
