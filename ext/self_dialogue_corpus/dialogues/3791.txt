Did you watch the Shallows?
Yea, I hated it.
Why? It was so good!
No, it was dumb. I mean who get's stuck on a reef.
You never know. Maybe lots of people that go missing, actually got stuck on reefs.
Hah! sure. But anyway, Blake Lively is a bad actress.
I thought she was great. And so beautiful.
Yea she's beautiful, but she's no shark killer.
Yea, I kind of don't like it when shark movies have happy endings.
Same here, people can't beat monster sharks.
