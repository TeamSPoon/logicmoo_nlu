Which pop music band is your favorite?
I think it has to be the Beatles.
Oh right on!  I like them a lot.
They were so popular in their time. There's been no other band like them.
They're in their own category it seems.
And they wrote so many classics.  I enjoy their songs so much.
Classic is a good word.
Also their music still feels fresh today.
Its really clever stuff.
Too bad some of them are gone now.
