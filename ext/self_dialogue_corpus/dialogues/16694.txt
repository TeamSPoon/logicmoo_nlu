Hi.
Hello.
What's up?
Not much, you?
Yeah same here.
Cool.
What kind of music do you like?
I like rap.
Thats cool, not a fan myself.
You don't like rap?
No not really.
Why?
I don't know, just not for me.  I can't relate to it I guess.
Man you're missing out.
I mean maybe, but there is just so much music.
Yeah, but that includes rap.
I see your point, but I just can't get into it.
Different strokes for different folks.
yeah that's true.
yep.
