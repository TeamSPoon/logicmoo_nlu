Do you think they'll make a sequel to Zootopia?
I imagine so, it made a ton of money.
What do you think the story would be about?
Judy Hopps stops a predator on a routine traffic stop and ends up shooting and killing them for no reason
Yeah, I don't see Disney making that movie.
Her partner Nick Wilde sees the whole thing and has to lie for her.
This doesn't feel very Disney.
The climax is a tense courtroom scene where the city offers a $3M settlement to the grieving family in return for their silence.
This got really dark, really quick.
Over the credits, various unseen cell phone footage is shown of Judy and Nick covering it up. The End!
