Here we go again. Rate your Top 5 favorite movie soundtracks. Ready?
I'm always ready. Crazy question. I have to think this through.
You sure do. Only Top 5. I couldn't take giving you ten choices. You're terrible.
Yes, you're right. Well I know "Purple Rain" is number one. Prince made me fall in love with it.
Yes he did. Rest in Peace Prince. That album was massive.
From watching the movie, I was completely entranced. He was magic.
I can't believe he's gone. He was another genius.
He played all the instruments that ever was. Incredible artist don't last long it seems.
Well Prince lasted longer that lots of legends. He probably has so much unreleased music.
I can imagine that. He was so particular. He was a perfectionist.
Oh yes he was. He poured over every aspect of his music.
That could be hard to deal with, but you can't question his art. He was a master.
Did you ever see him in concert? That's one of my biggest regrets.
I am one of the fortunate ones to see him live. He of course was incredible.
That's awesome. When was that? Purple Rain days?
No. I was too young to see him then. I saw him in 1998 at Madison Square Garden.
That must have been wicked. Did you go with anyone? Who was on the bill?
It was completely incredible. My best friend bought us tickets for my birthday. Chaka Khan and Larry Graham.
That's crazy. Prince wrote "I Feel For You". She had a hit from that.
Prince's influence is so huge. He's going to live on for centuries through his music.
