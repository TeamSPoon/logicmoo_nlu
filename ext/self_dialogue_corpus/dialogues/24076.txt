Who's your favorite director?
Tough choice! I think I'd have to go with Wes Anderson, though.
Why is that?
Well, I like the subjects of his films, but I also think the way the scenes are filled is really beautiful.
Beautiful in what way?
I think it's because everything tends to be very symmetric, and I love how it looks.
Oh that makes sense! Do you have a favorite film of his?
The Life Aquatic is a classic, but I'm also a big fan of Grand Budapest Hotel.
Grand Budapest Hotel sounds familiar. Who was in it?
It has a huge cast! Ralph Fiennes plays the main character.
Why does his name sound familiar? What else has he been in?
He was in Schindler's List, and In Bruges, and he played Voldemort in Harry Potter.
Oh yes! And didn't his younger brother play young Voldemort as well?
That's right! His brother Joseph played Tom Riddle.
That's so neat. Tell me about that other film, The Life Aquatic?
Yeah, that's probably my favorite Wes Anderson movie. Bill Murray plays Steve Zissou, and they spend the whole film hunting down a 'jaguar shark'.
What's that supposed to be? A parody of something?
Yeah, the whole film is a tribute to and parody of Jacques-Yves Cousteau!
Wow, that's really cool!
I agree. Wes Anderson's films are brilliant.
