I just caught a show in Reno.
Who was playing?
Royal Bliss.
Are they still touring?
On a limited basis.
Why limited?
I heard that they are bases out of Utah, so they're just hitting the western states.
I see. Was it any good?
It was OK. They're not my favorite.
Why did you go?
It was free.
My favorite price!
You going to see any other shows this summer?
No sure. Have you heard of anything coming up.
I heard Willey Nelson is coming through town.
Why would you want to see his show?
He's about a hundred, so it's now or never.
I guess. I didn't know you liked country.
No my favorite, but I'd like to be able to say I saw him in concert.
I can't argue with that!
