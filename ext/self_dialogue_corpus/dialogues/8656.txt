I heard that U2 is on tour this summer.
U2?! Are they still around.
Of course they are. Still rockin' after 35-40 years.
That's amazing. I would love to see a U2 concert again. It's been a while.
Yeah, I once saw them live in the '80s.
It's been almost that long for me too. Where are they playing?
MetLife Stadium in NJ on June 28.
I'm sure it's sold out.
I don't know. Ticketmaster is still advertising it.
Maybe I'll check it out. I'd love to get my hands on some U2 tickets.
