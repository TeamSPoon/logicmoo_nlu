Have you ever seen The Faculty?
With Josh Hartnett right? And I think Usher made an appearance in it too.
Right he was one of the football players. It was a great movie.
It's been a while since I've seen it. Reminded me of Invasion of the Body Snatchers.
That's the movie they sort of based it on. Lots of movies have used that same theme.
Have you ever seen The Stepford Wives?
The original one or the newer one?
Have you seen either?
Yes I've only seen the newer one with Nicole Kidman.
Right I have to say I like that one a little better than the original.
Usually the original is better but then you have those exceptions.
Right like normally sequels aren't as good as the original but an exception is Terminator II
Terminator II definitely outdid part 1 but that was because it came much later and special effects had improved.
That's true. I saw it at the movies with my dad when it first came out.
That's awesome. Are you a fan of Arnold Schwarzenegger?
Of course I am! Isn't everybody? I even liked Kindergarten Cop.
Yeah that was a cute one along with Twins with ihim and Danny Devito
Whatever happened to Danny Devito? I haven't seen him in anything in a while.
I guess he's retired. He and his wife Rhea Perlman are somewhere relaxing that's for sure.
They make such a cute couple too. They remind me of how cute Ruby Dee and Ozzie Harris were as a couple.
