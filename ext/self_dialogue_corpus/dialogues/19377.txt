Hey, have you heard any good music on the radio lately?
I don't really listen to the radio much, but I've heard some great songs on Youtube.
What have you been listening to?
I really like the song Wagon Wheel by Darius Rucker.
Oh yeah, that's an older one but it's great!
I know.  Did you know he used to be the lead singer for Hootie and the Blowfish?
Oh wow, really? I had no idea.
Yeah, I saw them in concert several times in the nineties.
Yeah, they had a totally different sound from Darius Rucker's music today!
I know.  I would never make the connection.
He has a new song called If I told You that's pretty good.
Yeah, I've heard that one.  It's not as good as Wagon Wheel.
No, but it still has pretty good lyrics.
Yeah, I'm not wild about it.
Wonder why Hootie and the Blowfish split up?
I have no idea.  They were really popular in the nineties and had a lot of hits.
Yeah, they did.  Then they just sorta disappeared.
Yeah, but Rucker definitely reappeared on the scene.
Yeah.  His new music is much better than the Hootie music ever was.
I definitely think so too.
