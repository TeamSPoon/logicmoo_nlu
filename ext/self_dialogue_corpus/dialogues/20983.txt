You know what the worst movie plot twist is?
Oh, great, here we go. What? I hated that movie about this girl, and she moves in this place and befriends this woman and falls for this widower guy, and the neighbor woman turns out to be a ghost of the widower's dead wife... That sucked.
I have no idea why I know what that movie is... Safe Haven.
Yeah! Safe haven. That sucked.
no. I was going to pick the planet of the apes, where at the end they show and Lincoln Monument with an ape Lincoln sitting on it.
That was retarded too.
That's saying it lightly. It's like they wanted to say the ape world has gone exactly as our world has gone and they decided to dedicate a monument to their version of Lincoln. That was so stupid
You know what's even more retarded?
What?
That movie with, what his name, the old English guy. Um... he gets into this romance with really young girl, and the girl ends up sleeping with the old guy's son.
I have no idea why I know this movie based on that description, but, yes, the old English guy is Michael Caine, and the movie is called Mr Morgan's Last Love.
Yeah! That movie. That was just creepy.
Creepy because the son of the old man and the girl the old man was attracted to decided to get it on?
That's exactly why!
Well, I guess there are things that are worse.
Not many things are more creepy that sleeping with your dad's love interest who's 30 years younger than him.
That's not really creepy, it's just morally objectionable.
which is... creepy.
Well, believe it or not, the actual story line is not all that creepy, but quite charming. The old man loved his old wife who has passed, and ends up with this void in his life, and then this young woman comes in and make it seem just a bit more bright. And then his son, who's having problems with his own marriage, comes to check on him, and the girl and the son has an affair. It's a messy confusing story line, but it's plausible.
Well, I 'll just leave it at confusing.
