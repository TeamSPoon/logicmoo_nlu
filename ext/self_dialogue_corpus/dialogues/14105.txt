I introduced my little sister to some Lady Gaga music last night.
Oh yeah? What did she think?
She loves it. Born This Way is her jam.
Great message.
Agreed. I feel like that song has something for everyone.
Yeah. It's about loving yourself, no matter what.
A lot of Lady Gaga's music is like that.
Yeah. It's so empowering.
I've never really been a fan of female pop singers until her.
Me neither. I think it's because her music actually says something real and doesn't just pander to men.
