TV is playing 'Tarzan' movie. Want to watch it?
Want to revisit the childhood?
You will find it surprising but I haven't watched the movie.
Seriously, how did you even manage that?
I know. Even I find it hard to believe. What is the best thing about the movie?
The animation was pretty advanced for that age. I loved the way they portrayed the chemistry of Tarzen-Jane.
It's kind of embarrassing that I haven't watched it till now. How many oscars it won?
I guess they won an oscars for Best Music, Original Song.
Oh! Who gave the voice for adult Tarzan?
Sorry friend, I don't know much about it.
