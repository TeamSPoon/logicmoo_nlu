Sooo I watched the movie "Logan" again last night.
Haha how many times have you watched it dude? Like 50?
I lost count at this point. It keeps getting better everytime I watch it.
Ohhh I'm not disagreeing dude, that movie gave me the feels.
You can say that again! I cry at the end everytime. It's kind of pathetic lol.
Real men cry too brother hah. I hope they keep the movies coming even though Wolverine is dead.
They have too!!
Yeah I think you're right. Logan is going to become her father's prodigy.
I hope you're right! I dont know if I'll be able to live myself not knowing what happens.
Psh haha imagine how much of baddass Logan is going to be when she gets older.
