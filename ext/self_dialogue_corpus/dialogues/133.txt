Did you get a chance to watch the flash on netflix yet?
Yup. I watched a few episodes the other day when I was hungover.
Did you like it? I watched the entire first season a couple weeks ago.
Yeah it was alright. I thought the show's story line was really good but it seemed a little cliche.
What do you mean by cliche? I thought the show was fantastic.
I dont know, it seemed like Marvel was trying to hard to piece together each episode if that makes sense?
I'm still not following you dude, explain.
It justt seemed like the different villians in each episode came into the story really fast and left the story line too quick, Idk just didn't feel much of an attachment to the charchters.
I didn't get that vibe at all. The series really made me feel a connection between everything that took place.
I guess I'll agree to disagree with you on this one my man!
