Who are your favorite non-main characters in Disney movies?
Oh, like not Aladdin or Woody?
Yeah, like in Beauty and the Beast, I like Belle's dad.
Oh sure he was funny, and invented some really interesting things.
Yeah, so who is one of your favorites?
Oh, I like the side kick characters best, like the crab in The Little Mermaid.
Do you mean Sebastian?
Yes, his song was one of the best in the whole movie.
That's true - he really added a lot of fun and humor into The Little Mermaid.
Yeah, I think that's what the side kicks do best, is to be able to add jokes to the movies.
