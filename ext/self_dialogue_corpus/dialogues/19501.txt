Let's talk about heavy metal.
Oh yeah, let's do it!
I've been listening to a lot of it recently. Lots of good stuff out there.
You don't strike me as a big metal guy.
I'm not, but every now and then I'll go through a phase.
Who are you into recently?
I've been listening to a lot of this band from France called Gojira.
I've heard of them, never listened to them though.
They're pretty good. Mostly faster stuff, growly vocals, very clean sounding.
Do they sing in French?
No, it's all in English. I actually held off on checking them out for a while because I thought that metal lyrics in French would sound kind of goofy.
Who else have you been listening to?
This isn't the most original answer, but Mastodon's new album is pretty good.
Oh yeah? I thought they were kind of past their prime now.
They're definitely a bit past their prime, but the new album is a big improvement over their last couple of albums.
Fair enough. I'll have to check it out.
The drummer sings a lot on this one.
Bummer! I'm not really a fan of his singing.
Really? I kind of like it.
I just like it more when Mastodon gets a little more growly and mean, and the drummer's voice is so high.
