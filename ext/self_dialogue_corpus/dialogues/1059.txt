I want to see the Browns be good again
That is never going to happen
They are on the right track
Well they are tanking for sure
Plus they have a ton of draft picks
I mean they are doing the right thing just the wrong process
Osweiler could turn out to be OK
No he showed hes not a leader this year in Houston
Yeah I mean they overpaid him but I dont blame them
Its a classic backup QB case, happens all the time in the NFL
Who is the next one to be just like him
Mike Glennon in Chicago.
So you think Trubisky starts this year?
No I think they tank as well, again.
Wow but they still have to pay both of them
I dont think thats the issue
Trubisky is only on the rookie deal for a little bit
And sitting a year lowers his value.
If he was a trade commodity yes, but he isnt.
I think he lasts 3 years in Chicago and they draft a new quarterback
