Did you ever see Birdman?
Yes, I didn't like it at all. Strongly disliked.
Really? I thought it was pretty interesting how they shot it.
Very depressing and unwatchable a second time.
Yeah, I guess I would never watch it again.
Yeah, I can't believe it won Best Picture. So many other good movies.
What would you have picked?
Whiplash for starters.
Oh yeah, that was good. J.K. Simmons was really good as the teacher.
Yes, agree. I also really liked Grand Budapest Hotel.
Hmmm, I don't remember that one.
It's a Wes Anderson movie. Very colorful, but also a great story line.
Okay, I'll have to check that one out.
I also liked American Sniper.
Yeah, I didn't really care for that one.
Really? I thought it was a very interesting story.
That's just it though. I heard the story was a little fabricated.
Well they always do that for Hollywood.
Yeah, but then a lot of people take it for the truth.
Yeah, that's true.
