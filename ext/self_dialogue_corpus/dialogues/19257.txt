What do you think of music on the radio nowadays?
I absolutely hate it.
Why?
I just like radio music years ago
What's wrong with today's radio music?
It's all trip. It's all rap. It's all the hype without the finesse
Oh I kind of get what you mean?
Yeah. It's too repetitive, and there are too few vocals it just sounds like noise.
What music did you used to like?
When it was B.O.B, Eminem, even Katy Perry, Lady Gaga. The music was powerful. It had vocals.
There's some strong music today though. Justin Beiber? Adele?
Yeah sure there are some, but those aren't the most popular.
Maybe you need to get with the times?
Ah maybe it's not too bad, and I'm just a nostalgic sucker.
I agree though, I like older movements like R&B.
Yeah they sure don't make R&B anymore.
I'm sure there's music of your genres somewhere too. They just aren't on the radio.
Yeah I don't listen to the radio much anymore. I can find my bands and singers on spotify or youtube.
Right. Maybe the old times made better music, but you can find better music today.
Yep.
