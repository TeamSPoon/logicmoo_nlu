Have  you had the  chance to  see  the  Jane doe  movie ?
is it  very  suspenseful ?
It is  predictable  but  i think it has  a  few  good  turns .
Is  it  very gory ?
There is one  scene  where  they  cut her open  and pull her  skin  back  thats  pretty  brutal .
Did  she  live thru  that ?
Jane  actually  starts  as a  dead  body in the  mourge .
So its more  about  finding out  who she is ?
Yes and  what  killed her  which  is where the  twist  comes in .
I might  have to  check that one out  is it in redbox  yet ?
