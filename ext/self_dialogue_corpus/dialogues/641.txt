You a Giants fan?
Nah, I'm not a big fan at all.
I really liked them during the Bill Parcels era.
Yeah, that was a pretty good era.
Yeah, he was there during the 90s.
How many Super Bowls did they win back then?
The won one in 1986 and another in 1990.
Oh I remember the 1990 one. That was against the Bills.
Yep, one of the four that the Bills lost.
Yeah, that was the infamous Scott Norwood kick.
Yeah, who can forget that.
And the start of the Bills Super Bowl losing streak.
Man, must hurt even more being Scott Norwood.
How many Super Bowls have the Giants won in total.
Four in total. One in 2007 and one in 2011.
And they both were against the Patriots in the 2000s.
Yes, I believe you are correct.
Man, they know how to play against the Pats.
Yeah, Tom Brady's worst nightmare
Definitely. The New York Giants!
