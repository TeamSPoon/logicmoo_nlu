I love the movie Ratatouille.
It is really fun. It made me crave Italian food.
Me too. It was very cute.
The main human character reminded me of my friend.
Oh yeah? That's funny. There are many memorable characters in that one.
Yeah, that little chef was so funny.
I did not think he would be such a bad guy.
But, in the end, everything worked out.
Yes, I'm glad that reviewer liked the food.
I did not see that coming.
