I finally watched 'The Sixth Sense' last week.
Wow, you were really late to the party on that one.
It's funny that I just never got around to watching it before.
So what did you think of it?
Surprisingly, I didn't figure out the ending, and no one has ever spoiled it for me.
Oh that's great, because if you know beforehand, the whole film would have been ruined for you.
Yes, I can't believe I didn't see the ending coming.
When I saw it when it first came out, I didn't figure it out either.
I guess that's why they call it a twist.
It's so much fun when it happens and you don't see it coming.
