did you see hancock
yeah the movie with will smith?
he was a great character
it was cool to have a superhero that really isnt that super
well, what do you mean by that?
he has power but he's kinda a jerk
i know what you mean.
he is no goody goody two shoes superman or anything
yeah, i loved that too.
he just did not care
he was imperfect and it was more real than other heroes
well aside from things like the watchmen
the watchmen were all so messed up in the head
they were kinda a different level
yeah, they were criminals and thugs to be honest
but they went through their issues too
yeah but thats true with everybody
and not everybody becomes like them i guess
thats what i mean
they suck
