What good quarterback will never win a Super Bowl?
Matt Stafford.
No? Why not?
He plays for Detroit.
Is that it? They're pretty decent.
Well for one, they feel snakebitten.
Yeah, 0-16 puts a pall on one's franchise.
But also, look at their division.
Green Bay, Minnesota and Chicago.
Yeah. That's a tough division.
Except Chicago.
Right, but Green Bay is great and the Vikings are on the rise.
They're sneakily good.
So I think that's a tough road ahead of them.
I can see that.
Plus, they've lost Megatron, and he was huuuge in that offense.
They've got Reggie Bush though.
He's had some lucky years there, but their RBs are snakebitten too.
I suppose, yeah.
And there's still no replacement for Johnson.
