Have you heard Justin Beiber's new song Despacito?
Yes! Isn't it so good?
It really is. I feel like he's slowly started releasing songs again.
Yeah, he's been kinda absent for a while, hasn't he?
I think so. At least i haven't seen many in the top charts. But Despacito is fire right now. It's so catchy.
DO you even understand the words?
Not really, but I still like to sing along. I just mumble the parts I don't know.
He also released I'm The One recently. That song has a lot of famous people on it.
Yes! It's so good and I love Chance the Rapper who is on that song too.
Yeah, Chance has slowly started getting really popular. I heard he doesn't even charge for his music right now so he lives off of donations and merchandise purchases.
Really? I wonder if he took any money for making that song?
I mean, if JB and DJ Khaled and Lil Wayne did, it would be weird if he didn't.
Still, I kind of want to purchase some of his merchandise now. I've never heard of an artist not charging for his music.
Yeah, it makes it less about money and more about the heart of the music. I really respect that.
I agree. Plus, it's really good music! His songs are really catchy.
Didn't him and Justin Bieber do another song together?
Yeah, I think it was called Juke Jam.
Yeah, that's the one! It's really catchy for a slow song.
It's so good though. They make a good due. I hope they release more songs together.
Me too!
