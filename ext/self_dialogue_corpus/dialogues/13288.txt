You know, Daniel Craig played a storm trooper in The Force Awakens?
I know, and it was a huge waste.
What? Why?
Because you have 007 on set and you cover his face in plastic armor? Please.
What would you suggest they do?
I don't know, put a ton of makeup on him? Make him into an alien?
How is that any better?
You'd still know it's him; just a distorted version. As a stormtrooper, you'd never know without being told.
Oh, I see. Like, a little 'blink and you miss it' easter egg sort of deal?
Something like that, yeah. At least let us know he was there without having to look at IMDB.
