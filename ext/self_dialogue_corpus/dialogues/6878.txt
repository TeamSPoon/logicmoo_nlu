What's your least favorite Disney character.
That's easy, it's Malificent.
Ugh, what a horrible movie.
Yeah, what were they thinking?
Well they redeemed themselves with the new Beuty and the Beast.
I love the music in the origninal.
The new one has new songs.
Terrific, I'll have to watch it.
Disney has had some great villains.
And many great heroes/heroines!
