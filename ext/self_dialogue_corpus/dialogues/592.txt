What do you think about the Browns this year?
I think they are actually going to surprise some people.
I know, right?
They drafted well the last few years and seem to be going in the right direction.
Well its about time.
No kidding, how many years has it been since they were decent.
Well since before they moved?
I think you are right.
Did you hear about the Cinnicinnati option?
No?
Well there is discussion about coaching changes and the impact they might have
For this year?
Well next but I am sure how they all do impacts that.
Crazy!
Speaking of the Bengals what do you think?
i think they have some good pieces but I am not sold
I know, every time I think I am they dissapoint me.
I just don't think they are ready for the big time yet
Maybe if they get some veterans
I agree
