What is the best quotable scene from the Star Wars movies?
I think it has to be, "These aren't the droids you're looking for?"
Really?  More so than, "No, I am your Father?"
Okay, perhaps you have a point.  That is the quintessential Star Wars line.
What about, "Now THIS, is podracing!?"
Now I know you're kidding.
You're right, I was joking around.
I think the most overused one may be "Do or do not.  There is not try."
Definitely overused.  I heard it in a graduation speech once.
You were correct about "No, I am your father" being the clear winner.
