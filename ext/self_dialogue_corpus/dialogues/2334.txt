Do you watch the NFL football?
Yes I try to watch every Sunday.  Do you?
Most games yes.  Do you do fantasy football?
I am in 2 leagues this year.
Who's your top picks?
If I get first pick trying to decide between Leveon Bell or Ezekiel Elliiott.
Two good choices, I think I'd go with Elliott.  Young and strong.
Yeah I hope so.  Who's your top quarterback choice?
Brady is always tops or maybe Rodgers.  But depending on who's left.
Yeah, Dalton always does well for me.
I like Dalton, he has good numbers.
I think Drew Bree's days are limited.  What do you think will be top defense?
That's a tough one.  Maybe Arizona or Seattle.
Don't forget Houston Texans. JJ Watt should be back and he's a killer
Yes I've always loved JJ Watt,  he's a good guy.
Yeah I just don't care for the Texans.
Me either.  Not many people like them.  Who's their quarterback?
I think some rookie Watson. Don't know much about him.
Me either I do know Weeden is a back up.
He was a joke when he was with the Dallas Cowboys.
