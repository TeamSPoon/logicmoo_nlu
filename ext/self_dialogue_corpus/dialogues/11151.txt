I see you're wearing Gymshark's women's workout leggings and gym tights, Jan.
Yep. They came in the mail yesterday.
Just in time for today's workout.
Exactly.
How do they fit?
They fit really well on me. I did some lunges, squats and dead lifts and they held up.
I've been thinking about ordering myself a pair.
You should. They are worth every penny.
Which one are those?
They are the Neon Tropical Legging.
Do have a hidden pocket?
Yeah. It's concealed along the waistband.
I think I will order a pair when I get home.
You won't regret ordering them. These figure sculpting and high waisted, are very supportive.
They look like they are pretty comfortable.
You wouldn't believe how comfortable they are.
I'm not fan of the color though. I would have to pick something less loud.
You know they have a selection of colors.
I think I will get the blueberry marl colored ones.
Those are so cute.
