Did you end up seeing the Warcraft movie?
Yeah I did.
Did you like it?
It was alright but just missing so much.
Like what?
I'm honestly not sure it just didn't scream World of Warcraft to me.
yeah me either sadly.
Just something off about it.
I think the actors did well.
I liked the story too.
What was it then?
I think they tried to make it too realistic honestly.
That's a fair point, it's really not a realistic kind of movie.
I think if they would have gone with an animation like Avatar it could have been awesome.
That sounds awesome.
Yeah it does.
Just hope they do more it was cool to see Gul'dan in movie form and all the other characters.
Yeah it was nice to see everything on the big screen after so many years.
Do you think they will do more?
I think a couple yes.
