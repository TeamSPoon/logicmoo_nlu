Do you like classic comedies?
What do you mean by classic?
Do you like movies like Airplane?
Yeah, I love that movie!
I do too! What's your favorite part?
I like the whole bit with the copilot.
That part is pretty great. It makes me laugh every time.
I also just like all the puns in that movie.
I feel like they just don't make movies like that any more.
I know! I really wish they would make more movies like that.
