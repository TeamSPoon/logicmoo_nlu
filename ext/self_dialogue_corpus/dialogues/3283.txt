What was the last horror movie you watched?
I like the classics, so it was Evil Dead.
The breakout role for Bruce Campbell?
Yes, exactly.  It's my favorite movie of all time.
What is so appealing about it?
The grittyness and the creativity.
What do you mean by that?
Well, they had a limited budget so they never let you see the real evil spirit to maintain a constant tension.  They also got very creative for the special effects and makeup due to the low budget.  The film quality, or lack thereof, lent itself to the overall eerieness of the movie too.
So nothing to do with the acting itself?
No, the acting was also great.  Bruce Campbell is a bit hokey but still feels real, like how an actual person would when faced with possessions in a cabin in the woods.
