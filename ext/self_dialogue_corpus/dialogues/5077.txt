Did you see the Yankees against the cubs the other night?
Yeah. Wow that was the longest game. I was watching until 2:30 in the morning!
I know right? Eighteen innings. It was a crazy marathon.
Its a rarity to see them play.
Yeah I think it's been 3 years since they've been face to face.
I'm glad the Yankees swept them.
Yeah I'm glad that the Cubs finally won the World Series last year!
They broke the 108  year curse! I'm happy for them too.
I'm watching Yankees vs Astros now.
It's crazy how we swept the Cubs but we are losing to the Astros.
We shouldn't  have traded McCann.
Well Sanchez is a good DH and he's a great catcher.
I dont know If Sanchez is up to par since his injury.
He just came back from the DL and he's trying to adjust. He'll be fine.
How about that Aaron Judge?
He's awesome! I think he broke the video board the other night with his hit!
Yes he did. the Yankees aren't  going to fix it either. They say it will go down in history as a static record.
Thats so funny. I'm really looking forward to seeing all the new young players.
Me too. I miss the old dynasty but I think we are going to do great with the new home grown!
I agree! Its time for another Championship! Number 28!!!
