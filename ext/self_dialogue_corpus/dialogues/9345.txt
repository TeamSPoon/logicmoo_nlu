This hip hop stuff is different
How is it different
it is more mellow than the rap i usually listen to
Well it is not the same as west coast rap
I mean it is more nuanced and has a different type of  beat
That is the point of it
I like how rap and hip hop have different genres
I know the musics diverse
Diverse as can be man
For sure
