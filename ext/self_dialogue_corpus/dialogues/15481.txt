So have you heard that The Killers are releasing their new album soon?
No, I hadn't....Do you know when?
I'm not sure exactly but I think in the next month or so.
That's cool.  How did you find out?
I read it online.  They had released a new video.
Oh, really?  What's the name of the song?
It's called "The Man".
So what did you think of it?
Well, I've only heard it a couple times but I'm not so sure about it.
Is it nothing special or just maybe a grower?
It's a little cheesy, to be frank about it.  I expected more.
Yea, they have made some exceptional music.  What were you hoping for?
The thing is - I loved Battle Born, their last album.  I was hoping it would at least be up to those standards.
Did you think it might be?
I wasn't optimistic because the lead singer, Brandon Flowers, said that Battle Born was an inconsistent record.  I thought it was outstanding so I couldn't see where his head was at.
OK, I understand.  Well maybe the rest of the album will be better!
I sure hope so.  Someone has to keep the New Wave flag flying!
Why, is that your favorite type of music?
It sure is.  Music from the 80's is still the best.
There certainly were some awesome tunes!
