Have you seen any good movies lately?
I recently saw Pirates of the Carribean on video.
Oh. Which one?
It was Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides from 2011.
What happened in that one?
It takes place after At World's End. They go on a trip to the Fountain of Youth.
Would you recommend it?
It depends. Do you like the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise?
I do, actually. I've seen the first one and Dead Man's Chest.
You would probably like this one then. It was one of the biggest films of 2011.
I bet it made a lot of money then.
It did. It's up there with some of the top earning movies in the world.
Who is in this one?
It has Johnny Depp. It also has Ian McShane and Penelope Cruz.
I wonder if they're going to make another one.
There's one for the summer of 2017, actually.
Oh. Have you seen it?
I haven't. Would you like to see it with me?
Sure! When is it out?
It's already out!
