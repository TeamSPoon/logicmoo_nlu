My favorite kinds of movies are comedies.
What's your favorite?
I really like Judd Apatow movies like This is 40.
Did you know that Leslie Mann is actually his wife in real life?
No, I didn't!
Yes, and the two girls in his movies are actually their daughters, Iris and Maude Apatow.
I also really like Adam Sandler movies.
I think he's hilarious! I love Big Daddy.
Big Daddy was good, but my favorite is 50 First Dates.
Is that the one where Drew Barrymore plays a woman with amnesia?
