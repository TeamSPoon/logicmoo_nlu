Hey! You are the midnight piano player - I never knew you played!
Hey, haha, I guess it never came up.
Who is your favorite composer?
Umm, I like Debussy. His music is just like an aether through which you glide in reverie.
I'm not too familiar with Debussy...
Do you know the impressionist movement?
Yes, but do you like Liszt?
I like Liszt, and he has certainly found a formula for orgasmic music, but he is a bit predictable.
What about Bach?
I really don't like Bach. If you had to describe it, I would say Bach is very geometrical.
And Vivaldi?
They're both very predictable. I don't really like Baroque period music at all.
More of a romanticist?
Yes, I think Rachmaninoff is wonderful.
But you play Beethoven so well!
Thank you, I like the angst in Beethoven's music, but his chords are predictable as well.
Everyone has a signature set of chord progressions?
Yes! I haven't really studied any music theory formally, but you can tell there are patterns - you see certain intervals over and over again.
Have you ever thought of being a professional musician?
Yes, I have, in high school, I practiced for four hours a day because I thought I would be a musician.
