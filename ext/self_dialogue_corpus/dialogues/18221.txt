Do you think ringo and Paul McCartney will ever tour together.
I hope they do.
I do too.
What a show that would be.
It would be awesome.
They could do so many Beatles tunes.
There is plenty to do.
Just hearing them do sgt peppers and a little help from my friends would be enough.
I heard ringo is working on a new album.
Yes I've read that.
He had paul play some bass on some cuts too.
That I didn't know.
Paul has been working on a new album for awhile.
I liked his last one,new.
Yes,that was good.
Amazing music he wrote.
And is still writing.
Exactly.
Ringo has had his share of hits too.
Very successful solo career.
