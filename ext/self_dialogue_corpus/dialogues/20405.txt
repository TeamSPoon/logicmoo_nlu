What movie does everybody love, but you hate?
I'm scared you will be made if I tell you
Never, everybody body has a movie like this
Well honestly speaking, i hated Mean Girls
What? Thats a cult classic!
I know, everybody loves it, but I think it's the worst movie ever
Worst? Why?
Well for starters, the humor is so bad
Lindsey Lohan was great in it though
She was good, but nothing special.
What about Rachel Mcadams?
She was just Meh as well
Well didn't you find the plot entertaining
The whole subject of revenge that they tackled was so overdone and is very juvenile
Yeah but sometimes juvenile can be fun, can't it?
I guess, but the way it was execute was just...wrong
How would you have made it better
I would have hired a better script writer for the jokes
Well, it is what it is I guess
Yeah, we all have our different tastes
