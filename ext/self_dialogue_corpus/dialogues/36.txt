So what is your favorite super hero movie?
I really like Guardians of the Galaxy and its sequel.
Oh, I really love those movies, Star-Lord is my favorite character, what about yours?
I love Drax, he is so funny, he never gets any of the jokes.
Ha, yeah. He is even funnier in the second one.
Yes, him and Mantis have some of the best scenes in the whole movie.
Who would of thought that the best superhero movies would feature a talking tree and a raccoon.
It just shows how good of a studio Marvel has, I wish DC Movies were as good as Marvel.
Yeah most of them have sucked so far, but Wonder Woman was amazing!
I haven't seen it yet, but she was the best part of Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice.
