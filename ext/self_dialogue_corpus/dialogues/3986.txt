Did you ever see the Sixth Sense?
It's my favorite movie ever!
What's your favorite part?
I like how the aliens are so creepy and were seen in other countries too
I loved that part, with the Spanish birthday part!
And what is your favorite part?
I like how the aliens are hurt by water, that is so random
And the little girl happened to have tons of water glasses around the house, right?
Yeah she hated dirty water so she left them glasses out everywhere
Oh man, I never saw it coming! What a good ending!
