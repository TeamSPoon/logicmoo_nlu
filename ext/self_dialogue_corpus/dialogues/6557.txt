Did you hear they are making a new Toy Story movie?
Really? Another one?
Yes. I can't say I'm surprised.
I know it is really popular and all, but what else can they do with the storyline?
They have all been really cute. They will think of something.
I never watched the second or third ones. I did see the Halloween short, though.
Well the midway toy story mania is super popular in disney world.
Yes it is. We're lucky to get on it more than once per trip.
They are also making Toy Story land in Walt Disney world too. It's gonna be awesome.
I suppose it makes even more sense to make more movies. Gotta keep that brand alive!
