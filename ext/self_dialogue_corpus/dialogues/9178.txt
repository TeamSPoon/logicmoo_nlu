What's your favorite rock group?
I really like Foo Fighters.
I do too, though I'm more into their older hits.
Like Everlong and My Hero?
Yeah, their newer stuff isn't as good to me.
Like stuff newer than Learn to Fly?
You know exactly what I'm talking about.
Yeah, I feel the same way about Foo Fighters' music.
Do you also like Red Hot Chili Peppers too then?
They're my favorite band!
