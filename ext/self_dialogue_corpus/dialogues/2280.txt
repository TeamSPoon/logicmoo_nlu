Hey there, excited about the Cowboys chances for next season?
You bet! Would have loved keeping Romo on the bench for insurance since you saw him step in at the end of the season last year and make a TD, but whatever.
Dak and Zeke are amazing, but makes you think they won't flake out in their sophmore year?
I think Prescott has the maturity to keep going--he's already shown his leadership with the old guys. I just hope Elliott doesn't get himself hurt with all his gymnastics!
Zeke's on fire! He's fun to watch.
Yeah, he sure does light a spark under that offense and makes those veteran look life-like again!
Now if they could only pull it off during post-season--it sucks only getting there and then never winning.
I don't know what it is about the post-season. Even with a bye week they still managed to come in and screw it up.
Just can't play more than 16 games a year, I guess!
I don't know if it's coaching or what?
Same thing happens every time they get there since.... I don't know... Coach Switzer? Back in the mid 90s??
I blame Jerry Jones. I know he got us three rings but it seems like he cost the team a lot of integrity.
What do you think people want--Super Bowls or integrity? I bet I know...
Truth... it's about the money. Not like when Tex Schramm and Landry ran the team.
Nah, still about money, just in a different way. Stop being so idealistic! Remember all the guys that had the team after Schramm sold it.
I'd just like to see my 'Boys win and stop getting into trouble.
... and Jerry Jones keep out of coaching and player business and just stay up in the owner's suite where he frickin' belongs!
Here here!!
Makes me want to go down to the new stadium in Arlington and pay some exorbitant price for a ticket!
Not so new! But, then again, I last saw them was in the "old" stadium in Irving, and they had been there since before I was born!
