What do you think was the best era for rock music?
I'm going to say the mid 60s to the late 70s.  So many good bands at that time.
Yeah, Rolling Stones, Beatles, Zeppelin, Fleetwood Mac...
I love Fleetwood Mac!
What's your favorite song by them?
Silver Springs I think, even though I love so much of their stuff, so it's hard to pick one.  You?
I really like Songbird, and Never Going Back.
Some deep tracks there.  Favorite album?
Easily Rumors.
I would love to see them in concert.  Do they still tour? I've got the biggest crush on Stevie Nicks.
