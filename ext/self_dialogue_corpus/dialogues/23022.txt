Did you see that movie Jackie Brown?
What made you ask me that?
I was watching it last night. Did you see it?
Yeah I saw it back in the day.
Did you like it?
It was alright. Could have been better.
I know right. Your boy Chris Tucker was a fool.
You mean for getting in that trunk?
Yeah.
I know right.
Ain't no way in hell I'm getting in the trunk for anybody.
Especially fresh out of jail? You got to be kidding.
I would have told Samuel L, naw dude, Imma stay home and chill tonight.
He tried to. Samuel L. come talking that sit in the trunk with the gauge nonsense.
Yeah. I think Tarantino has made better.
I know right. I like Pulp Fiction.
What does Marcellus Wallace look like?
Say what again. Say what one more time.
Samuel L. had that grease dripping Gherri Curl and stuff.
That thing was looking greasier than a mug.
