Are you a fan of old movies?
You betcha. One of my favorite cable channels is TCM.
Don't you just love it when they do a whole day of movies with a certain star in them?
Absolutely. I also like the days when they feature one director.
Let me tell you my favorite. I like the Hitchcock marathons.
Wow! Me, too. What's your favorite?
Well, his older films are better. It starts with Strangers on a Train, I think.
Yeah, and then the ones with James Stewart as the leading man. Not many of them, but all great.
You said it, Vertigo, Rear Window...
Were there any others?
I can't remember right at this moment. Too bad Hitch's later movies kinda declined in quality.
What do you mean?
Well, you know, like Family Plot, one of his last, if not his last, it was awful.
Yeah, but just before that he made a couple with his muse, Tippi Hedren, in them that we quite good.
Right! The Birds and Marnie.
Wasn't Sean Connery cool in Marnie?
Now, that's another topic. Sean Connery the movie star, what a hunk!
Yeah, too bad he retired.
Well, like I say, there's always Turner Classic Movies and we can keep watching and watching.
I can see so many of these "old" movies over and over again, and they never get "old"! Isn't that great!
