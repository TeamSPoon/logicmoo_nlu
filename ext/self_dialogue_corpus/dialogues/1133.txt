I think the Cowboys are going to kill it this year.
Aren't you worried about the Seahawks, the Packers, even the Vikings.
There are some good teams out the in the NFC.
It surely will be exciting to see how the senior league shakes out this year. Dis you know that there used to be a separate league, the AFL.
I do. The Broncos, Patriots, Bills, Chiefs... There are a bunch, they had their own league until 1970.Before that, they were totally separate.
That is why Joe Namath is in the Hall of Fame. He brought respectability to the league. He beat the NFL Colts with his AFL Jets. He even guaranteed the outcome beforehand.
That was ballsy. The Jets were the upstarts, but they kick Baltimore's butts.
It really changed the adversarial dynamics of the league. The AFL gained respectability. They wont Super Bowl IV too.The chiefs Walloped the Vikings!
Then it was time to break bread.They new league would be much more powerful. A new level!
That is obviously how it turned out.Even greater than the league could have hoped.
Football is now king! It hasn't even been close for the last 20 years. Baseball is a distant number 2.
Hey, remember! We are only supposed to talk about pro football. What do you think of the Giants chances in the NFC East?
It all depends if the receivers can play like they did last year....without all the drama!
That stupid cruise down Miami during the playoff layoff was foolish!
Odell Beckham has to grow up and think! He is such an enormous talent.But, he has to grow up.
Would you take him over the Cowboys Dez Bryant?
No.Dez seems to have settled down. There age difference is small.As much as I like Odell's talent, I would keep Dez.
I like that the Cowboys drafted Ryan Switzer. Do you think he will replace Beasley?
I think they should keep both.I thought Cole had his best season last year. Why jettison him?
Well, that is just the scuttlebutt. I heard it through the grapevine!
