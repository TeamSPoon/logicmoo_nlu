Have you seen the new power rangers movie?
No i havent but i really want to see it!
You definitely should! It was really good i felt like a kid again
Did they bring back all of the original power rangers?
No, they used different people for the parts but same concept
Oh wow! I think they should have at least used one of the originals
Yea! I agree but another must see is Beauty and the Beast
Oh yea i saw that!
Did you like it?
Yes i liked it! I just didnt like the ending,with the two guys dancing
Yea, i agree i think they need to let kid movies be kid movies and stop confusing them
Yea totally agree!
I heard disney was doing a peter pan movie as well
Oh really i feel like they did that already
Yea i know! I would love to see them do the lion king! That would be really interesting to see how they redo that
Yea that woukd be awesome l!
