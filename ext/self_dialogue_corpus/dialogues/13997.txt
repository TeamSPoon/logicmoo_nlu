When did you first start listening to Lady Gaga?
I started listening when she first got popular with Poker Face.
See, I didn't catch on till The Fame Monster.
That is my absolutely favorite album of hers.
Mine too. I like how it deals with obsession and the dark side of fame.
Paparazzi is the best.
I feel like it works on a fame level, but also on a relationship level.
Yeah. She's good about writing in a way that reaches everyone.
I like that she seems really connected to her music.
I agree. It all feels really heartfelt and passionate.
