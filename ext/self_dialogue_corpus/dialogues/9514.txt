Did you watch the BET Awards?
I watched clips of the performances online.
Did you see Future perform "Mask Off" with Kendrick?
Yeah, Kendrick really stole the show.
I know, the crowd went crazy when he came out.
He sounded really great live. He delivered everything perfectly.
Did you see Post Malone and Migos perform too?
Yep. I thought it was fun that they did "Bad and Boujee."
Thank god they didn't bring out Lil Uzi to do his verse.
I know right? I feel like his verse kinda kills the song.
