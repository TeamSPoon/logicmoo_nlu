I want to update my wardrobe with some spring pieces soon.
Me too, I was looking through Vogue recently reading about the new spring 2017 trends.
What were the trends?
Well, there are a lot of pieces coming out in the color pink.
I like baby pink and candy pink. Balenciaga has some beautiful spring pieces in pink.
Pink is very trendy this year.
Florals are big this spring as usual.
True, but this year they have more of a 1970s vibe to them.
I might try a geometric print. Maybe on a maxi dress or a skirt.
Sonia Rykiel just came out with a really cool geometric print poncho. It was a part of the spring fashion runway show.
I'll look up a picture of it later.
While you're online, look for jumpsuits. I think a jumpsuit is a great piece to have for spring and summer.
I agree. I may try to find a denim jumpsuit.
I want one too.
I'm going to buy a ton of leggings as well.
I love leggings they're so comfortable so I'm glad they're on trend this season.
Louis Vuitton designed some gorgeous lace leggings for Spring.
Y/Project makes beautiful velvet leggings.
Velvet and lace leggings are great because they can be dressed up to wear out for the evening.
I know, style and comfort. What more could you ask for?
