What's going on with rap music these days?
What do you mean?
The songs these young dudes is making today are kind of lame.
I know. I don't even listen to none of these new rap artists.
Who do you listen to?
I still listen to Nas, Jadakiss, Rakim.
Rakim is that dude.
I know. I have his first few albums in my library.
You talking about the ones with I know You Got Soul?
That, Move The Crowd, Follow The Leader.
Follow The Leader was the truth.
Was? Still is to me.
That's right. I be banging these old school joints like they just came out.
I know right. Then all these young bucks be asking me, "who is that old head"?
They be hearing that banging bass and them eight oh eights and be losing their mind.
The rap game today don't do it like it did when we were growing up.
Shoot. You got me about to listen to some Special Ed.
Which one?
I Got It Made.
That right there is a classic.
