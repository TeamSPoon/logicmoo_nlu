Any new movies you want to see?
I'm excited for wonder woman
That one does look really good.
I hope it's as good as I'm expecting
I'm sure it will be, they've been really good with the superhero movies.
They have been, they all are great.
I want to see get out, it looks like a funny horror movie
Oh, I've been wanting to see that one too
It looks good
It really does
So does the new pirates of the Caribbean movie
I didn't know they were coming out with another one
Yea I think it's in theaters now
Now I want to see it
Those movies are really good
They have great plots
And Johnny Depp is great for the role
He is perfect for it
They cast him perfectly
They did
