Currently, do you have a favorite NFL team?
Of course I do. It's the Denver Broncos.
They are a great team. I bet you were very happy last year when they took it?
Oh absolutely. I actually had to work the next morning at six in the morning but made sure to stay up until the end of the game.
I think it is safe to say that they redeemed themselves after 2014?
Oh please do not get me started on that game. That was truly difficult to watch.
It was a rough one. I believe it went down as the most one-sided SuperBowl game of all time.
I can surly believe that. I had a friend who was betting a little bit with co-workers and he lost money very quickly!
I remember thinking of you when that game was going on. Thinking how you must've tossed your TV across the room!
It came close. I was at a friends house for that game, and he is not a Denver fan, but even he felt it was very hard to get through.
Are you family Denver fans, also?
Actually, no. Just my step father, who lived in CO for a chunk of his life.
Do you remember what his thoughts were on that game?
If memory serves, he did not even watch the whole thing.
Did he even make it to half time?
I believe he said that was when he turned it off.
Safe to say, not due to a lack luster half time show?
Not at all! He was very upset with his teams performance and could not take anymore.
Needless to say, the Broncos made it up for it last year.
And I was truly happy to see it!
