So, please tell me what you think of Lilo and Stitch.
It has been forever since I've seen the movie, so I really can't say much about it.
Do you at least remember Stitch?
Yes, I do remember the little blue alien.
What did you think about him?
I remember that he got in all kinds of mischief.
Yes, he did. I think that made the movie.
It did because I still can remember those aspects of the movie.
The movie was basically based on the antics.
If I can recall, they were hilarious.
