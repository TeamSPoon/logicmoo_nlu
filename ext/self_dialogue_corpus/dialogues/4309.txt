Have you seen the 1990's  thriller movie Primal Fear?
I know I have at least heard of it. Who is in it?
It's with Edward Norton and Richard Gear. It's actually a pretty good movie with a crazy twist ending.
What is the movie about exactly?
Richard Gear works as an attorney for Norton's character, who suffers from multiple personality disorder and is on murder trial.
Doesn't sound too bad. How is the acting, especially of Norton?
I think Edward Norton completely steals the show, in my opinion. He is real good at bouncing back and forth between the different personalities.
Primal Fear sounds like a good "Popcorn flick", as they call it these days.
I would strongly suggest you check it out sometime. I will not spoil the ending.
Okay sounds good and I look forward to seeing it one of these days!
