Do you remember when the Falcons too Ryan in 2008.
They grabbed him in the second pick right?
They grabbed him in the second pick right?
Yeah, I think it was the second pick and they only got him for a fraction of what the Bills got EJ for.
EJ is playing with some real vets.
Yes, but the Bills don't have a single Super Bowl player on the team.
The Bills has a fresh line up, but that also means they don't have a bunch of bad habits.
I guess they can improve once their head coach is gone.
Flacco did get some good playoff wins.
He did have some impressive plays. None of them got Flacco to the finals.
Let's hope Flacco's new contract can get him to the finals.
It shouldn't take him more than two seasons to hit the finals.
You are assuming they keep their head coach. Flacco has never taken to new leadership well.
Yeah, he did interfere with the new running back a few times.
Dalton and Rogers got overlooked in the draft.
I didn't even know their contracts were up.
Their contracts have both been open since last season.
Free agents usually don't go for the bidding wars, but I guess they are staying put for now.
Dalton, can't be that picky. It's not like he's going to get on a playoff team.
The Broncos were courting him, but I don't know what happened with the negotiations.
