I hate when this happens
What happens
Well some movies they are just made poorly
How is it poor
Well you know how things move right
Yeah?
Well sometimes it is called pacing
Okay
And some movies have bad pacing
How can it be bad
Well sometimes it moves to fast it misses things
well that can be bad
It is more than bad
Hm?
It is detrimental to the movie
What about if its slow
That is still better
How
Well it might take longer but nothing is skipped
I guess so
