Who is your favorite artist right now?
Hmm, I have so many.
Narrow it down to two, then.
Okay, well my first would probably be Alessa Cara.
Who is that?
She's a pretty new singer.
Oh, so she's like Pop?
Yeah, exactly!
Is she on the radio a lot?
Recently, yeah, she has a couple songs.
Which one should I listen to, do you think.
I like "Here", that was her breakout song.
I'll have to check it out.
You should!
Well who is your second favorite right now?
I like Panic at the Disco, currently.
YES, I love PATD.
They haven't released anything this year yet but they're so good.
Yes, I loved "Death of a Bachelor"
I agree, what a great album.
