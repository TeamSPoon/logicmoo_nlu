Do you like Wes Anderson movies?
Of course I do!
I just watched the Royal Tennebaums.
What did you think.
I loved the dark humor in it.
It was off the wall, but also made sense.
Had a realistic feel even in the craziness.
You would like The Grand Budapest Hotel then.
Who plays in that one?
It has Ralph Finnes.
The guy that played Voldermort?
Yes, he is amazing in it.
Is it like Anderson's other films?
I think it is his best one ever.
Better than Rushmore?
So much better, it is more grown up.
He has a new one coming out next years.
What is it called.
The Isle of Dogs, comes out in 2018.
I hope it hold up to his other movies.
