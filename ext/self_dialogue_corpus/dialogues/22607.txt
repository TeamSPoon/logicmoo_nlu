Since most people have, I assume you saw Deadpool from last year?
Definitely saw it in the theaters and I enjoyed it.
Some friends and I went and saw it, as well. Were you a fan of the comics?
I actually was not and not very familiar with the DeadPool character at all.
Same here, actually. The only thing I remember seeing from DeadPool was his brief role in the X-men movie back in 2009.
Yes, I remember that, too and was not too impressed.
I remember going last year with my friends with an open-mind. I didn't even it was rated R.
Same here! Once the credits started rolling and the jokes began, I had an idea of what kind of a movie it was going to be.
I think so many people enjoyed it, because it's simply something different.
Definitely agree with that. It's not your typical super hero movie and is very funny.
The movie was just fine and you can't help but love Deadpool. I also liked the fourth-wall breaking throughout.
Same here. Ryan Reynolds definitely reedemed himself!
What was your favorite scene or funny line?
I actually loved the scene where it's a cutting to different parts of him looking for Francis.
Yes, that was great. The part where he is interrogating Jeremy, the pizza boy, was real funny, too.
I think, as a whole, it was an all-ground enjoyable movie.
Did you see the trailer for the sequel?
I saw the teaser, yes, where he takes forever in the phone booth?
Do you think the sequel will live up to the original?
I definitely hope so but all we can do is wait and see.
