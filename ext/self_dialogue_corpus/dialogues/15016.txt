What is a good comedy?
I like Groundhog Day.
Really? Who is in that?
Bill Murray is in it. He plays a weatherman.
That is wild. What does he do in the movie?
He is reporting on Groundhog Day and enters a sort of purgatory that he can't get out of until he fixes his life.
Wow! That sounds like something I need to experience!
Are you talking about the movie or the purgatory? The concept is so great that it makes you think like that!
I am talking about both!
Awesome. Go check this movie out now. It will change your life.
