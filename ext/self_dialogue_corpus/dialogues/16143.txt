So did you know when Metric is coming out with a new album?
No, but I really wish they would.
Oh?  I didn't know you were a fan really?
Of course!  I just love the way Emily Haines sings.
Me too.  They can be a little spotty, album-wise, though.
True.  What was your favorite?
Probably Synthetica.  How about you?
It has to be Fantasies.
Yea, that's a great one!
They incorporate so many sounds!
They sure do.  I really appreciate their New Wave influences.
Of course!  Do you have a favorite song?
It would probably be Artificial Nocturne.
Yes!  I love that one too!
I also loved Lost Kitten!
Sure, another right tune!  Now I can see why Synthetica is your favorite Metric album.
It has to be.  I also like Dreams So Real and Breathing Underwater.
You're making Synthetica my favorite Metric album now!
It sure is an outstanding album!
There's no doubt about that!
