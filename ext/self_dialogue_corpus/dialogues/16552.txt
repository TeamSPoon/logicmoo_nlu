hi gubis
sup how's it going?
cool man, please when coming over to mine, can you get me drakes new album from the CD store? would transfer the money to you when you come.
alright no worries, but why drake, Kendrick is killing it out there now and is album also drooped this month.
you can't compare drake to Kendrick i think they both have different style of rap.
oh you think drake raps.
of course he is a rapper.
lol. drake be singing on all the hit songs he's released of recent, from "hotline bling" to "one dance".
true though, but that doesn't make as he started as a rapper.
but then i know you love rap music so wondering why buying a drake that sings now when you want to listen to rap music.
hahaha, well i just think i am a die hard fan so anything he drops makes sense, rap or singing.
alright then as you want, would get it when coming.
or maybe if you've got extra you could buy be the Kendrick's album. am a fan but not compare to how i love drake.
that dude spits fire, is flows are not out of this world.
chill bro. lol he's not that good compare to likes of nas,2pac and biggie
oh i meant that in the context of the new skool, everyone already know those are great rappers.
well just get me both drake's and Kendricks CD.
alright bro would get them.
and please don't forget to come with dj mix i would need for the party.
no way , i've already place it in my bag.lol
