I am really excited about the 2017 NFL season. Are you?
Yes, I am excited, especially due to the wild finish from the 2016 season superbowl.
Speaking of the superbowl, which two teams do you think will be in the 2017 Superbowl game?
I think Baltimore Ravens and Atlant Falcons.
I can understand Atlanta getting into the superbowl for the second year in a row, but Ba;timore might be a stretch.
I believ that Baltimore is the only team in the AFC that can beat the New England Patriots.
Your correct. There aren't many teams in the AFC that can beat New England.
Baltimore has a history of playing New England tough.
I agree with you. Baltimore is one of the only teams that play New England competitively. I believe the Patriots will go back to the superbowl.
I expect Baltimore to bounce back strong this year, and I don't see New England in the superbowl for a secon year in a row.
On the NFC side, I, I think Matt Ryan can play well again this year. I expect to see the falcons in the Superbowl.
I like the Packers for the superbowl.
Aaron has a pechant for losing tough playoff games.
Yeah, but I expect the Pakers to find a way to win.
The game shoulfd be interesting.
II aleays look forward to NFC games.
I look forward to all football games.
I do too.
I love football
I love football too.
