Do you think The Beatles still have an impact today?
No I think they are more or less a historical item.
I dont doubt that but I think there are people just getting into the genre who appreciate them.
What genre?
Rock and Roll
I dont think they really did rock music.
Are you serious?
I think most of their music was pop.
I starkly disagree with you on that.
Really?
I mean they played all 4 instruments.
So what all pop music stems from instruments.
And their music was different than the times.
People said Elvis was rock music.
At the time it was.
I am arguing that right now their music would not be rock.
OK I guess I can see your point.
Its the right point to be honest.
I agree with you then.
Its not that disagreeable of a point
