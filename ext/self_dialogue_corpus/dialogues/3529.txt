What is the scariest japanese-american horror movie?
I think it is probably The Grudge.
Was that the one that was originally Ju-On?
Yes, this one has Sarah Michelle Gellar in it.
The sound that the boy and woman makes is terrifying.
Exactly, it is like a creaky groan.
My favorite part of the movie was when the ghost was under the covers.
That scene completely blew away my "safe spot" when I'm scared.
There was no happy ending either, which was different at the time it was released.
Now you never know if a movie is going to end good or bad.
