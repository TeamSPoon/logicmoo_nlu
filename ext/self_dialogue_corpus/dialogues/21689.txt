I am so excited I get watch Lego Batman tonight.
I saw it in theaters. I think you'll like it.
Do you remember the name of the guy who voices Batman in the movie?
It is Will Arnett. He's the guy from Arrested Development.
That's right. He voiced Batman in the original Lego movie too.
He was the funniest guy in that whole movie in my opinion.
I am extra excited to watch it now. We are watching tonight after supper.
I know you will love it.
I love Eddie Izzard and I heard he plays a character in the movie.
There are a ton of stars in the movie.
Who was your favorite character in the movie, other than Batman?
Bane is my favorite. I think he was voiced by Doug Benson.
Who's that?
He is a stand up comedian and sometimes actor. The guy who is always high.
Oh yes I like him he is very funny.
I also liked Harley Quinn but I don't know who did the voice.
Do you remember how long ago the movie was in the theater?
It came out in February. I remember because I took my wife for valentines day to see it.
My kids went to see it with a birthday party they just love Batman.
Who doesn't love the Bat!
