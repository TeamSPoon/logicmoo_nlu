Have you ever listened to Jeff Rosentstock?
No what does he play?
He plays mainly rock music.
Oh ok I will have to check him out
He was in a larger collective music group called Bomb the Music Industry
What style did they play?
Same thing but they had hundreds of rotating members
Sounds interesting to be honest
He would have anyone come on stage at live shows and perform instruments.
Wow thats pretty different if you ask me
Yeah I loved it but him as a solo artist is just as good
Does he still play the same kind that he used to?
No this is more straight forward
How many albums has he put out
Two proper releases now
Can you get them in stores
No he does a system where you pay whatever you want to
Wow a true DIY ethics type of guy
Yeah he thinks its important to have those still
It means alot more when an artist does that
