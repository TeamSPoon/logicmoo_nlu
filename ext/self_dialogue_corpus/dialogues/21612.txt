Hey, have you seen the new Ghost in the Shell movie?
I haven't seen it yet. Have you seen it?
Yes, I just watched it last night.
What did you think of it?
It was definitely different from the anime version. I'm still not sure whether Scarlett Johanson was the best choice for the leading role.
That's sparked up some controversy.
It definitely has. I guess since she's Hollywood she might attract more people to watch the movie.
True but I think that could compromise the integrity of Ghost in the Shell.
I don't have as much to say because I'm not a super fan of Ghost in the Shell but I can say that Scarlett's performance changed the vibe of the original anime.
So do you think the film is worth watching?
I think it is. It still looks visually pleasing and the story is decent.
But just don't go in thinking it's going to be like the original?
I would say that. It would probably fair well with people who have never seen the original.
People who come in with no expectations right?
Yes, I think even for people that are a fan of the original, it would be better to watch it with no expectations.
I think I'll probably watch it then.
Yeah I think you should. I really did like the look of the film.
I've seen pictures and the setting looks incredible.
It looks like a real world that exists somewhere.
I'm a sucker for science fiction settings.
