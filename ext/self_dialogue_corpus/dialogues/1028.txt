Hey are you ready for the next football season? Are you playing fantasy football?
Yeah I am really ready. I'm tired of no sports playing at the moment.
Who are you rooting for this year?
I think I am rooting for the seahawks
Do you think they will be ready to get back to the superbowl?
I think so, Russell Wilson has been training his body and getting work done
You don't think the trouble between Wilson and the legion of Boom will affect this season?
No, I think that was all created by the media, I really don't think there is any real substance going on here
Yeah I kind of agree with you, I think when it all comes down to it, they all want to get back to the glory of the superbowl
What do you think of Lynch coming back and playing for the raiders?
Yeah I think it is crazy, it will be a must watch game when they play the seahawks
Do you think he will be back to his old self?
I'm not sure, he does not look fast in his training videos, he looks bigger, but he has always been big
Yeah, not to mention that he is one year out of the league and 30 years old
Yeah that is ancient in terms of football
I'm not sure if he can handle the likes of the new and younger players in the league
Yeah I agree, he was a legend, but coming back after a year off is tough. Remember these are all pro players and they are all very good
True that. I hope he does well. Do you think the Patriots are going to repeat?
Tom brady sure looks good, I think as long as he is healthy, they have a really good shot
Yeah, he is old, but as long as he doesn't get hit too often, he will be fine
