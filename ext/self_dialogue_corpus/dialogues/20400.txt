What kinds of movies do you like?
I like a lot of artistic movies.
Like what? Also, what do you mean?
Well, artistic in a couple different ways.
Please explain more.
The directing style has a lot do to do with it, like the Tarantino movies.
Oh, that I can understand. What else?
A lot of movies do kind of the same thing, or have the same kinds of characters in them.
It definitely feels like that sometimes.
Yeah, it makes each movie kind of feel predictable.
So, an artistic movie to you is one that is unpredictable.
A lot of it is that, but it has a lot to do with the emotional impact of what you see too.
How is that?
Well, in the movie Amelie- have you seen that one?
No, I don't think I have.
Oh it's great! Just the way everything is directed is so interesting to watch.
What do they do?
There's a narrator that talks about things like a cat's personality and what it likes to do.
That's pretty funny.
Yeah, but each scene has all kinds of cool stuff in it and it actually has a lot of romance.
