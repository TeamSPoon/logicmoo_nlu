Are you still going to the concert?
You mean Americanarama? Yeah, I want to see Dylan again, haven't seen him for years.
But aren't you worried about terrorism?
Yes, I am, a little. But that won't stop me, it's Dylan.
Well, I'll worry about you.
Thanks. But maybe there'll be shorter lines for food and drink.
That's the attitude. Maybe there'll be discounts on tee shirts.
Maybe there'll be all-access passes for everyone. But I doubt it.
Yeah. Security is likely to be tight.
I've never been searched, maybe its my gender. But this time, for sure.
Yeah. They better search everyone.
I hope they do. I think they will, too.
Of course, that's no guarantee.
It's not. They got those kids in Manchester outside the venue.
Yeah, the powers that be can't keep us safe. Not really.
I know. But my music is my freedom to me, and I'm not giving it up.
I'll be thinking of you.
I'll be lying on the grass. Or dancing.
Yeah, it's a good venue. I wish I dared.
It's not daring. It's a little bit of defiance.
