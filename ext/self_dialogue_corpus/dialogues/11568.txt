what do you think the beatles think of shows like Love in vegas?
I am sure paul mccartney has some opinion. He is still alive.
I did not realize that. My bad. I wonder if he likes it.
I would think yes but who knows. I can't believe you thought he was dead.
I think of them as such an older band. They really epitomized the 60s.  I just thought they must all be dead now.
He is old but kicking. he is actually father of stella mccartney the fashion designer.
I did not know that either. I like her work but out of my price range generally.
Ringo Starr is still alive a swell. Though much less public than paul.
Really? wow I had no idea. I like ringo.what about george?
Harrison died in 2001 , I think it was cancer.
