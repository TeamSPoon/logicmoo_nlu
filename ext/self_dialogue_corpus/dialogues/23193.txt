Hey did you ever see the movie Cujo?
The Steven King movie?  Yeah it was really scary.
Yeah, that's the one.  The one with the dog.
Yes.  It really freaked me out!
It came out back in 1983 didn't it?
Yeah I know it's really old.  I'm not sure of the exact date.
I think that's right.  What kind of dog was Cujo?
I think he was a St. Bernard wasn't he?  I remember he seemed huge.
Yeah it's been awhile since I saw it.  Who was in it?
I remember Dee Wallace but I can't remember anyone else.
That came out around the same time as Pet Semetary didn't it?
I'm not sure.  I remember watching Christine.
Was that the one about the haunted car?
Yeah, it was actually pretty stupid.  I think it came out in 1983 also.
Didn't John Carpenter direct it?
Yeah I think that's right.  I just didn't think it was very scary.
No, Cujo was definitely scarier to me.
Well Cujo could actually happen.  Christine was a bit of a stretch.
You can say that again.  I do get scared of freaky dogs.
I don't like them either.  Not after watching Cujo.
