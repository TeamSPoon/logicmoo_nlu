I really like Drew Barrymore. She is my favorite actress.
She is good!
Yea, she has a lot of famous actors her family including Lionel Barrymore.
What movies was she in?
Some of my favorites that she was in were The Wedding Singer, Fifty First Dates and BOys on the Side.
I love the Wedding SInger, that is one funny movie.
Adam Sandler was her co star in that one. But her first movie was ET
That was a great movie!
Yea she was only about seven or eight in that one I think.
I remember she was really little.
SHe had a lot of problems with drugs later on in life and once tried to kill herself.
Oh that is sad.
But that is behind her and she continues to make good movies.
Has she had any recent ones?
I do not think so. None that I have heard of.
Me either.
I would love to see her do another.
Yea one with Adam Sandler.
Yes or maybe a serious role.
She is a great actress.
