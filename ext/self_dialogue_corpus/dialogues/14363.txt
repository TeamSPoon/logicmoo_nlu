Do you think the Celtics use that draft pick this year?
No I think they need to trade it.
They could use Fultz.
They may be able to but I dont think they need it to be good.
So what do they do with it?
I would package it for a proven star right now.
Like Jimmy Butler?
Maybe thats where they go.
But wont this help them by getting younger.
They are plenty young.
Plus they have the Nets pick next year.
Yeah so this is looking like its going to work out for everyone.
What if they dont trade it.
Then theyll have a surge in certain areas relative to the picks.
Oh OK, do they resign Thomas?
Depends on the person they draft.
I would keep him, he looks like a stud.
Yeah but he might price himself out of their range
I dont believe there is a price too high.
Yea he seems like he may be their core.
