have you seen pulp fiction?
I have seen it, but i haven't watched it recently
I think Bruce Willis gives an underrated performance in that
I almost forgot he was in it
it had an all star cast
who all was in it
Bruce Willis, Uma Thurman, John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Ving Rhames, Eric Stoltz, Christopher Walken and a few more i'm probably missing
Tim Roth and Harvey Keitel were in it too
oh yeah, that's right!
they were both in Tarantino's earlier movie Resevoir Dogs
that was another great film
some people theorize that both of those movies are in the same "universe" as each other along with a few other films of his
i didn't know that
yep there are subtle hints of names of characters who are related or linked to each other in those movies
that's crazy, I'll have to go back and re-watch those and see if I can pick up on that
there is also a wild theory about Vince Vega and Jules Winnfield retrieving the suitcase for Marsellus Wallace in pulp fiction
I think i have heard part of this
the theory is that Marsellus Wallace's soul is in the suitcase
you never actually see what is in the case in the move so it could be
it would make sense as to why it was so valuable to him
