Have you been listening to any kind of new music lately?
I discovered Gorillaz.
That's a funky name. Are they any good?
Most of the stuff is pretty good I would say.
What do they sound like?
They have a lot of different sounds actually.
Like what?
Some songs have a lot of rap in them, and some songs have a lot of pop in them.
Oh, that's pretty cool. What are your favorite?
Everyone really likes Feel Good Inc.
Fun title, it sounds familiar.
That's their most popular one by far.
Wasn't there a cover of that done recently?
Probably, I haven't heard it though.
What are some of the better albums?
I only know a few, but Demon Days is pretty good and Plastic Beach is my favorite.
Such interesting names. Why do they have cartoon characters also?
It's just their thing, they really only have one guy in the band.
Oh, I didn't know that.
Yeah the characters are the official bandmembers, but that's just for show and style.
