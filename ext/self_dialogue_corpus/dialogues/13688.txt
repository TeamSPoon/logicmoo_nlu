What do you think of Lady Gaga's duets with Tony Bennett?
I think they're great!
I agree! She does a great job with the vocals.
I think she sounds like an old jazz singer.  I don't mean old, I mean vintage.
What do you think of her solos on that album?
Yeah, they are really good.
I think her singing is great.
Have you heard her play the piano?
I don't think so.
She's great.
