Do you have a particular favorite rock band?
I have been a huge Avenged Sevenfold fan these last number of years.
I hear that. They are a great band and I've been listening to them for a long time, as well.
Do you have a favorite album of theirs?
I feel their self-title from around 2008 was very well done and had some great songs.
That was a good one. Nightmare, which I think was their next album, was also great.
Nightmare was an amazing album, too. I loved the song "So Far Away."
Did you know that song was completely dedicated to The Rev?
I have heard that, yes. Very sad he passed away so young.
Definitely but I think he would've wanted the boys in the band to continue on.
