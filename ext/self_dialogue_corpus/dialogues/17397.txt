what is the worst cover to you?
There are many.
Well lets go through them a little then. Top choice?
I really disliked Madonnas version of american pie.
who was the original by?
It was Don  Mac lean and amazing.
I liked the madonna version, but I LOVE HER.
I love her too, but she butcher this song. She made it into a dance song.
It was her take on it. Artist license.
I suppose, but it lost it's essence and beauty for me.
I do like that the original is a good sing along song.
ya there is none of that is madonna's.
I don't mind it because I enjoy the beat and dance vibe.
She should have just made a different song altogether in my opinion.
Maybe if you think of it as a different song you could learn to love it.
I don't think I would ever love it. But a change of a perspective is a good suggestion to deal with it existing.
It is not that bad!
I think we have a musical divergence of taste.
Perhaps we will have to agree to disagree.
I think so.
