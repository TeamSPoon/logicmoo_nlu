How do you feel about Ariana Grande?
My daughter really likes her a lot.
My daughter does too.  It is so sad what happened as her concert ended in Manchester England.
It was a senseless act from a coward.  I don't think I will ever understand terrorism.
Don't you think it is pretty great that she is going back to Manchester to do a benefit concert?
It is definitely a great act of both courage filled with compassion. It is making a statement to terrorism too.
It is pretty awesome too of the other artist that have stepped up and are joining her for the benefit concert.
What do you think of Justin Bieber joining in to do the concert?
I personally think it is great.  I hope he sings "Sorry".
Not to mention, his mentor Usher is also going to perform at the concert for the victims.
He will definitely keep Bieber in line.
I actually think Bieber might be growing up some.
Do you know of any more musicians who will be performing at the benefit concert?
I have heard that Miley Cirrus and Katie Perry will also be performing.
That is pretty awesome for all these artist to join Ariana Grande on the stage during this time of pain.
It is great.  I bet it will be an incredibly emotional concert.
What do you think of Ariana Grande going to the hospital yesterday to visit the kids who were injured in the bombing?
It actually brought tears to my eyes when i saw it on the news.
I think it is great that they are showing the world, they will not live in fear.
Me too, Ariana Grande you are doing an amazing thing that will help Manchester heal.
