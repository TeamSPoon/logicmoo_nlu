The draft picks are chosen.
Oh yeah?
Yeah.  I've been following Ivan Smith.
Is he good?
He was the best player at SMU, so they pulled him quick.
Oh ok, I've heard of him!
They're hoping he's strong enough for the league.
Why?
Because he only weighs 156 lbs.
That's small. Height?
I think he's about 6 feet.
Ok, yes that's kinda small.
He will beef up soon.
As he matures in the league.
I'm sure they'll up his dietary intake.
Lots of steak for him!
He has to gain weight.
Is it a requirement?
I'm sure it's not, but recommended.
Oh, I see.
