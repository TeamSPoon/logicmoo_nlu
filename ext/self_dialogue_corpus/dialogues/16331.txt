I hated my undergrad concert band director.
Adams?
Yeah, him.
I never met him but heard great things about him.
Yeah, he's in the college band director hall of fame, but behind the scenes he was an awful director.
How so?
Well, he was kind of creepy. The student helpers were always attractive girls and he was in his 70's.
Did he hit on them?
A bit, yeah.
Gross.
He also used the method of yelling to get results, instead of being calm.
Did he ever yell at you?
Once, without calling me out. I played a wrong note completely out of character, and he lost his head.
Sorry, but you should have played the right note.
I played an A-natural instead of an A-flat.
Ha, during a big moment?
Fortissimo, full band. Stuck out like crazy.
Did the audience laugh?
No, it was during rehearsal.
That's good, at least.
