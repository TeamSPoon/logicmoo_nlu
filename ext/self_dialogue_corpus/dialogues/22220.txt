Have you seen Iron Man?
I haven't, who is in that?
Robert Downey Jr, have you ever heard of him?
I have. He was in Due Date.  Did you see that?
Yes, wasnt Zach funny?
Yes, I think he is very funny.
I also liked him in the Hangover.
He was very funny in that too, but I didn't like the sequels.
Yeah, they weren't very good.
Did you see 21 Jump Street?
Yeah, Jonah Hill is hilarious.
I actually really liked Channing Tatum.
Yeah, he has great delivery.  The sequel was good too.
I havent seen it, was Depp in that one too?
No, he wasn't, it wasn't necessary.
Was it better than 21?
No, not really close.
Sequels are never better.
Not in comedies.
Right.
