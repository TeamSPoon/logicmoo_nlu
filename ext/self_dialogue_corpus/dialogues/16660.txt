I have always loved rap music, what about you?
I used to be a fan, but after I had kids I quit listening to it for the most part.
I can understand that, it has just always been a passion of mine.
I used to listen to Tupac a lot back in the day; I miss his songs!
Tupac is my all time favorite rapper, he is a legend to say the least!
There is no denying that, his ability to write songs was amazing.
You are correct about that, he was an awesome rapper, but his writing set him apart in my opinion.
What are some of your favorite songs of his?
I would go with Dear Mama, All Eyes On Me, and Changes.
Those are all good ones, I used to love that song Ghetto Ghospel.
Oh yea, I forgot about that one. He has so many classics!
Yes he does, I just wished he was still around to come up with fresh hits.
Yea, with so much going on in the world today, I would love to be able to listen to one of his songs about all of the madness.
No doubt about that! So, do you have any other rappers that you you like?
Yea I have always liked Eminem. He can also write great songs.
I have not listened to him in a while, but he is very talented to say the least.
Yea he is, he has a lot of songs that deal with personal issues that he has experienced.
I respect that, you have to admire someone with the courage to rap about family problems the way that he does.
I would love for Eminem and Tupac to have had a rap battle back in the day.
Yea that would have been a classic!
