What in a game drives you crazy?
Constant commercials and TV time-outs.
Well, duh. Everyone hates that.
Ask a silly question, get a silly answer.
Fine, what about gameplay annoys you the most?
Icing the kicker.
You mean when coaches call a timeout right as a field goal kicker attempts a kick?
Yup!
Why do you hate it?
It makes the game even longer, and it doesn't work?
It doesn't?
Nope, statistics show that the kickers aren't affected.
Don't they panic and re-think the kick and then mess up?
No, they get more time to re-think the angle.
Do they try to make it even if they know it's coming?
Yup. If they miss it, they make an adjustment. If they make it, they repeat it and they got a free practice kick.
What's the percentage of icings that work?
I'm not sure, but logic disproves it.
How?
If it works, it's chance. It can work sometimes and the coach is a genius; if it doesn't work he's an idiot.
