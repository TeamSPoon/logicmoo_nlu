Have you seen any comedies from the 1990s?
I have seen plenty. That was a great time for comedy.
What is your favorite from that decade?
I think I would have to say Dumb & Dumber.
I love that movie! Jim Carrey is amazing in it.
Yes, the cross country road trip he takes with the other character provides a backdrop for so many hijinks.
What is the name of the other main character again? I always forget his name
Jeff Daniels plays opposite of Jim Carrey in this movie.
They are an excellent team. They probably had a really fun time making that movie.
I agree. They seem like they get along really well and have great chemistry.
