do you have a favorite kanye album?
is there a right answer?
well, i do have my opinion.
its hard because all of his albums are so good.
he has the most critically acclaimed discography in hip hop.
even 808s had lasting influence.
not his best though.
what's your favorite then.
fantasy is the best
i like college dropout
i feel like those are the two best answer.s
yup. its when kanye needed that drive.
fantasy, he reinvented himself.
and college dropout is when he started.
both amazing albums.
do you think he's got another one in him?
of course he does.
pablo wasn't that great in my opinion.
i liked yeezus better
