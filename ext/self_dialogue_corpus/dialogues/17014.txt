John Williams has got to be the greatest composer ever.
John Williams? I feel like I know that name.
You should! Among other things, he did the soundtracks for Harry Potter and Jurassic Park.
Jurassic Park! That's iconic!
I know, right? I cried when the trailer for the new movie came out, simply because they used a few well-placed notes of the original theme.
Talk about capitalizing on nostalgia. And the Harry Potter theme is nothing to forget, either.
Yeah, even when Williams wasn't composing the soundtracks anymore, they still had to keep using his theme song as, well, a theme throughout the movie.
Wait, John Williams didn't compose all the Harry Potter soundtracks?
No, there were actually a few composers, including Patrick Doyle and Nicholas Hooper.
I haven't heard of any of those people.
I mean, they're not bad, but they're no John Williams.
What else has Williams done?
Oh, you know, little old projects like Jaws, ET, and Star Wars.
No way! You'd never really think to connect the dots on that.
Yeah, it's pretty interesting, because once you know what you're listening for, you can kind of hear some of his habits and trends.
I don't know, I don't think I have a good enough ear for that.
Honestly, I don't either, but there are some times that I'll listen to a song from a movie from the eighties or nineties, and it will have kind of a Harry Potter vibe to it.
Really? Isn't that like reusing your old work?
I mean, maybe kind of, but I think he just has a certain style.
And I guess you'd repeat yourself a little bit with so many different songs under your belt.
