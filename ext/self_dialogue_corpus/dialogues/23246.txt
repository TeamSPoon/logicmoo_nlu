Hey have you seen the new movie Bay Watch?
No I haven't, I wasn't sure if it really looked worth watching.
Well I have to say it really is. It also doesn't help that I love Dwayne Johnson.
Yeah I have to agree with you there, I am a big fan of his.
See than you should see the movie.
Well what was it even about, besides the normal Bay Watch stuff from the old show.
Well it is about everyone of course on the Bay Watch team and how they are trying to solve a crime.
So is it just funny or is there action too since they are solving crime?
It has both super funny parts and some pretty cool action parts.
I think I will watch it then when I get home. Who else was in it besides The Rock?
Zac Efron is also in it. He is pretty funny but at first I hated his character.
Yeah he can play a good jerk if you know what I mean.
Yeah absolutely. I think that they made a really good team in this too. One had a bad attitude while the other was happy and well liked.
Yeah in a lot of movies I have noticed they make The Rock out to be a really goofy and funny guy but still tough.
Exactly like in that movie Central Intelligence with Kevin Hart!
Yes I loved that movie! That is really one of the only reason I am going to give Bay Watch a try besides your suggestion.
Well I don't think it was as funny as Central Intelligence, but it is still a great comedy you have to see.
Sounds good I am going to watch it tonight. Maybe this weekend you can come over and well have a movie night and watch Central Intelligence again.
That sounds great. I will bring the pop corn.
I'll bring the drinks. And I will try to find more funny Rock movies!
