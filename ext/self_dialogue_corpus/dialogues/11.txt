What did you think of Wonder Woman?
Gal Gadot was amazing!
I couldn't agree more! She was fantastic.
She was the perfect Wonder Woman!
I liked the part when she was taking in all the bullets from the no man's land.
She looked like a total babe doing that!
It made me tear up a little because she was doing it out of emotional response from that family.
That was very touching, I cried on that part.
I want to see it again for sure!
Let's go together next time!
