Hey, are you a fan of the NFL?
Definitely. I love watching football.
Who is your team?
I am a Vikings fan. How about you?
I watch the Seahawks mostly. Do you think the Vikings are going to win this year?
I kind of doubt it. Our quarterback is injured.
What happened?
His knee got hurt two years ago and he is still recovering from surgery.
That is crazy. Those guys really do take a ton of abuse.
That is true. So many talented players have shorter careers because of injury.
Do you think the NFL needs to do a better job protecting players?
I am not sure you can. Football is a very physical sport.
Yeah, I agree. Who did you think is the best rookie this year?
He got drafted later, but I really like Leonard Fournette out of LSU.
I watched him play. He is a really physical running back.
Yeah. He reminds me of Reggie Bush.
Is Reggie Bush still playing?
Maybe? Last I checked, he played for the Lions.
Amazing how a guy can be that good and then gone in a few years.
Yeah, you never know who will last and who won't.
