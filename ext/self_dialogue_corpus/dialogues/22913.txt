So Johnny Depp came out with a new movie
Wow that's crazy did he make like 4 more before it
Which one you talking about Pirates of the Caribbean right
Yeah isn't that the movie he's mainly known for
Yeah but this one is called dead man tells no Tales
Let me guess the Dead Man start talking
Yeah how you know?  you seen it already
No it's just the title says it all seem like you'll be a boring movie
I mean the storyline was pretty bad but it was a lot of action
Johnny Depp always make terrible storylines people just watch the movie to see him
I don't know why Johnny Depp's not even that cute
Because he got that unique look and it's kind of cute
But the special effects on this movie was awesome
Did the zombies look real?
Yeah we didn't go to the regular theater we went to the IMAX
What's the IMAX
I think it's the same thing just a higher resolution
I'm have to check that out in the IMAX theater
I got a friend that one that said you can go with her
Alright tell her about how about this Saturday
