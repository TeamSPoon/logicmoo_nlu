What is your favorite lady gaga song?
I actually like one of her very first songs called "Just Dance"
I don't really remember that one.
It was one of the ones she released before she became very famous and more controversial.
She does have very unique songs and videos.
Yes she does and very eccentric taste in fashion too.
I do not think I have heard any new songs from her in a long time.
You're right, it seems like she has kind of disappeared for awhile.
For awhile there she was all anyone could talk about.
Maybe she is on tour in another country.
