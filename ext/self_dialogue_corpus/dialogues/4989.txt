Are you keeping up with the Rangers this year?
Not as much as last year...they are really struggling.
Yeah, they have had a hard time fielding, hitting, and providing good relief pitching.
Well...that pretty much sums up what a baseball team does...ha!
Yeah...but they did just win their sixth game in a row!
Oh, nice, they are back in the hunt?
Not so much...the Astros won five-in-a-row until Texas finally picked up a game on them.
Well, on the bright side, Texas usually whips up on the 'stros. Well, usually.
The Yankees did beat the 'stros today and are playing the second game of a doubleheader.
So, do we have to root for the Yankees!?
Absolutely, not! We just root that Houston loses every one of their games against non-Yankee teams.
That's right, you never, ever root for the Yankees!
Oh, my greatest sports moment was watching A-rod strike out at the ballpark, the year Texas made it to the first World Series.
I was there!
No way! Are you serious...I would give so much to go back into a time machine for that moment!
Ha...well, I remember thinking for the first time ever that I was in a baseball town.
Hmm, for some reason, Hamilton didn't get that same sense.
Yeah, that was tough when he left Texas and criticized the fan base.
I'll tell you one thing, if we ever get a time machine...I am going back to Game Six and pulling Cruz out of the game!
Oh, man, you had to bring up Game Six...I am now sad.
