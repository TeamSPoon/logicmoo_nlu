have you ever heard of the superbowl curse?
no, but i doubt it's real.
listen, it's definetely real, or else it wouldn't be a curse.
so what does it entail?
well, there's several parts to the curse.
the first i'm guessing is people who have ever won?
yep, teams that continously get to the superbowl but always lose.
well, i know the vikings have never won.
yep, and neither have tons of others.
well, they should try harder.
ha ha, well the other part of the curse is that people usually lose on their home field.
what do you mean?
basically, if a team plays the superbowl in their home area they are garunteed to lose.
interesting, like what teams?
okay, i remember the falcons definetely being one.
okay, so one team out of 32.
and the 49's! you dont remember when they lost?
i do, but they lost in their state?
yes, i'm telling you!
i don't know how much i believe this.
