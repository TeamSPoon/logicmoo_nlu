Did you see “The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo”?
Yeah, I saw both versions of it.
There was more than one version of it?
There was the foreign film version made first, and then the English one.
I only saw the English one, was the other one as good?
I liked them both, but if you hate subtitles then you might not like the Swedish one.
I am not a fast reader, so I probably wouldn’t be able to keep up.
The first one was the foreign one in 2009, and it got fairly good reviews. It got good reviews from both the public and reviewers.
The American version was pretty graphic.
I think the foreign one was more graphic than the American version.
I think I went to it with my girlfriends, thank goodness I didn’t go with a guy I didn’t know well.  That would have been awkward.
They both were graphic. Neither was a very good first date movie.
Sexual assault in a movie is kind of weird in a romantic situation.
The other books in the series were made in to movies as well.
In English?
They were made by the same people as the foreign version.
Were they good as well?
I liked them.  The book that was written by someone else after the author died will have a movie version coming out next year.
In English, or foreign language?
I am not sure.
