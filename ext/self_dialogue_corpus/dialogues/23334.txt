Power Rangers!
Umm... what?
Go go Power Rangers!
Ooohhhh you must have seen the new film. How was it?
Actually, surprisingly good. I was EXTREMELY skeptical when it was announced, being a hardcore fan since its release, but they actually captured the spirit perfectly.
That's awesome. I'll have to check it out.
You should. So what's up?
Not much just on my way to Guardians of the freaking Galaxy volume 2.
Really?
Yup. Been dying to see it but have been uber busy for weeks now. This is my first day to myself in forever.
Definitely a great way to spend your day. You should make it a double feature if it's been that long.
Y'know... I really should. Any suggestions?
Tons. Beauty & The Beast was fantastic but your wife would kill you if you saw it without her... um... Wonder Woman. Definitely Wonder Woman.
Really? But it's a DC movie.
I know, I know... but they got it right this time.
Seriously?
Completely. This is where they get their shit together and start catching up to Marvel in quality.
Dang, that good eh?
The only thing better are the dc animated universe movies but unfortunately they don't get a theatrical release.
It's a shame. Under the Red Hood and Teen Titans: The Judas Contract deserve a big screen treatment.
