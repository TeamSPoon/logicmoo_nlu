Are you into Eastwood action films?
Like Dirty Harry?
Yes, the old school nothing but action and a bit of romance here and there.
I think he is the perfect example  of action star.
His best one may be Gran Torino.
I loved how that one followed his life, like he was still old but a really bad and cool guy.
It reminded me of his part in Sudden Impact.
The raw tuff guy you mean?
Yes, that whole action man persona he does.
His work in the Enforcer, that was action to its core.
