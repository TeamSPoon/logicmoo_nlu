Do you like Sleeping Beauty?
Yes, the animation is beautiful.
It might be the most beautiful Disney film.
That is up for debate. Snow White is pretty gorgeous too.
Yeah, I even liked when it got more rough with 101 Dalmatians.
Yeah, that looked a lot different than the rest.
But, do you think Sleeping Beauty is the best Disney movie?
Yes, I do. It is amazing.
Was that made before Snow White?
No, after.
