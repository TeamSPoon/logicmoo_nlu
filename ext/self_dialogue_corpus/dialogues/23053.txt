Do you know what movie they should've made a second one of?
What?
There's Something About Mary.
I agree. They could've gotten away with a second.
The characters in the movie could have gone on to so many things.
They could've.
Ben Stiller is a funny actor.
He is.
I loved the way all the characters worked against each other.
Then there was Magda.
Was that the older lady with the bad tan?
Yes.
The best part was when he drugged the dog and gave it mouth to mouth.
I forgot that part.
That was great.
The beginning was hilarious too.
When they were going to the prom?
Yes.
Can you imagine that?
No.
