There is a new Pirates of the Caribbean Movie coming out.
Again?  There have been so many.
Ya, it seems like that.
The last couple weren't all that great.
Well the reviews on this one are a lot better.
Okay well that's a relief.
You can't go wrong with Johnny Depp as Jack Sparrow.
No, you are right about that.
And Javier Bardem is in this one as Armando Salazar
Oh he will be scary for sure.
