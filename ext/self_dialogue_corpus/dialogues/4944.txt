So what about them A's?
What are the A's?
They are a baseball team, I think they are on the east coast.
OH the few teams I know are on the west coast.
What teams do you know?
I know of the dogers and the giants but I am sure there are more, they can't just play eachother.
Well that sure is true. There's the national and then reginoal teams.
Baseball is so difficult, how do they hit that ball.
I figure it is with lot's of practice and maybe some drugs.
I don't think they can use drugs while in a professional sport
So when was the last time you seen a game.
It has been a few weeks, I went down to the statium and saw the red sox play
How cool.
It was but sort of sucked I mean it was eight dollars for a beer.
Wow that is extortion
I know I don't know how they could charge so much, I thought beer and baseball really went hand and hand but at those prices
True, I wish it was more accessible to go to more games
Who would you want to see?
I would want to see the Giants or maybe the Dogers
Me too those are the best teams but they are rivals.
