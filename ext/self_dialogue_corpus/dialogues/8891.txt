What was the first rock concert you went to?
Wow, so long ago. I have to think.
Mine was a music fest concert.
What like an all day thing?
Well, a half day concert. All great bands.
Who was it?
Journey, John Cougar, Brian Adams, The Tubes and Sammy Hagar.
All five. You were lucky, that's a great line up.
Steve Perry can really belt out the music. Brian Adams sang Cut's Like A Knife.
Wish I could've seen all them bands.
