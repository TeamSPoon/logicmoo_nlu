Are you a fan of Jay-Z?
Absolutely he is one of my favorite rap artist of all times.
Do you have a favorite Jay-Z album?
I would probably have to say The Blueprint album is my favorite.
I heard Kanye West produced a lot of the songs on that album.
No wonder they sound so soulful wouldn't you agree.
Without a doubt. I actually thought the Black Album was a great album as well.
Yeah you can't take anything away from that joint, it had a bunch of classics on it.
We should have known he would take the industry by storm just by his debut album.
Ah, Reasonable Doubt! A hip-hop masterpiece to say the least.
