Do you like horror comedy movies?
Sure, I've seen a few, why?
I saw this great movie the other day called Get Out.  Have you seen it?
No, I haven't but I heard about it.  How was it?
It was excellent.  it was funny and scary and thought provoking.
That sounds great.  Who was in it?
Daniel Kaluuya and Allison Williams, among others.
Oh, I haven't heard of them.
Don't worry about that.  They did an excellent job.  And Jordan Peele, from Key and Peele, wrote and directed it.
Really?  Wow!  I didn't know he did horror movies.
Yeah it was surprising to find out but he did an awesome job.
So what's the movie about?
I don't want to spoil it for you but this black guy is dating a white girl and they go to meet her family and some crazy stuff happens.
Hmm, I guess I'll have to check it out if I want to find out more, huh?
Yeah, but it will be worth your time.  It's still playing in theaters and it's definitely worth the couple dollars.
Is it too scary to bring my 12 year old to?
Honestly, I don't think it was scary or gory in that way but they probably won't understand a lot that is going on.  It may be a bit too complex for a younger kid.
Okay, no problem.  I'm gonna check it out.
Great, I hope you enjoy it!
I'm sure I will, thanks!
