Hey, what Beatles's songs and from what albums do you love?
I love "I Want You (She's So Heavy)" from Abbey Road!
Why do you love it so much? It is not one of the usual ones!
Well, it is because how unique it is!
What do you mean? Please do explain!
Well the song has a strong acoustic.  How about you? Which songs of Beatles do you like?
I am more mainstream. I love "Here Comes the Sun" and "Yesterday"
How about "Don't Let Me Down?"
Oh yeah, I love that number it is so easy to listen to!
I agree, I can "chill" while listening to it!
