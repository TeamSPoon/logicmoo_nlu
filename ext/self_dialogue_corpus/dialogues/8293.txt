So, here's something kind of a weird... music I like but hate the music video.
Huh... can't think of any songs like that off-hand, but one might pop in my mind while talking.
Well, I got one to start with Pink's "Try".
I don't think I've seen the video for that.
Well, like I said, I really, really like that song, to me it projects an image of preserving despite adversity and all, but the video has Pink and some random guy beat the crap out of each other while performing dance moves.
Say what?
Yeah, they're in a room together with all this paint and stuff and they get slapping and hitting each other.  I mean, I get it, it's all symbolic and relationships and stuff and how we can hurt each other real easily, but still.
Yeah... you're thinking, "They could have found a better way to convey that?"
Exactly! I mean, I don't know.. just was not what I was expecting.
Well, that's the interesting thing about songs, there's all kinds of different ways to interrupt them.
