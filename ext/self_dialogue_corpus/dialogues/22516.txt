Hi Jimmy, Mary here.  I am calling to find out if you have seen that latest movie on John Wick, Chapter two
Not yet, I knew it came out the other week, so I have just been working too much as usual!
Yes, I want to see it too.
There is another movie I want to see called the Mummy with Tom Cruise in it.
Yes, I saw that was about to come out soon.
Yes, I think it will be fun to watch.
I am pretty sure it comes out June 9th or so.
We can try to check that out at the theater that day if you want to.
Sounds good.
We can see John Wick now and try to this weekend.
That sounds great, I look forward to it.
What time do you get off work?
I get off work around 6pm.
Ok, then we can catch some dinner and go watch the John Wick film
What restaurant do you want to meet at?
The Grill.
ok, do they have one near the movies?
Yes, it's across the way from the movie theater we will go to.
Sounds great!
Ok let's do it.
