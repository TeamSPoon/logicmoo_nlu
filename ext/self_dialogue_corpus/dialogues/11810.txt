Were you ever into the Beatles when you were a kid?
Definitely. My mom bought me the Sargent Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band album.
That's a good one. What's your favorite song on that album?
Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds is my favorite.
Nice. My favorite is With a Little Help from my Friends.
Did you know Ringo wrote that one?
I didn't know that. Who wrote Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds?
I think it was Lennon.
I listened to one of their greatest hits albums. I can't remember the name. Anyway, that's what I was into when I was a kid.
I agree. Their music is so easy to listen to, and it reminds me of my childhood.
