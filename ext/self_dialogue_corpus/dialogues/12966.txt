Ok, so I can probably guess, but what is your least favorite Star Wars movie?
Definitely the Phantom Menace.
Because of Jar Jar?
Yeah, he's awful, but I thought the whole movie was a let-down after waiting so long?
Why?
It's kinda dull, with the race and little Anakin is annoying. The only good thing is the Darth Maul fight.
I have to agree-- I thought it was creepy there was a budding romance between Amidala and Anakin.
Yeah, that kid was like 8, and she had to be at least 16 or so.
All of the prequels under-delivered in my opinion.
Yeah, the series didn't really get good again until they took control from George Lucas.
