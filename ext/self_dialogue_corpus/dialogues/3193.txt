What NFL team do you like?
I guess you could say I'm a Bears fan.
Chicago? Is that where you're from?
Yes.
When was the last time they won?
The last year they won was in 1986.
That was before I can remember. Was it with Ditka as the coach?
Yes. The town went nuts.
Really? How so?
I remember hearing about the Lane Tech High School marching band being ransacked during the parade.
Who were the players?
I remember a few of them. Walter Payton was the star running back and William "the refrigerator" Perry was their main offensive lineman.
Why did they call him the refrigerator?
Basically, he was a big heavy-set dude, so people equated his size and weight with a refrigerator.
He didn't ahve the typical ripped physique people associate with athletes?
No, he was quite the opposite of that.
I see. Who was the quarterback?
It was Jim McMahon.
Was there a famous song about the Bears?
Yes. It was called "The Superbowl Shuffle."
