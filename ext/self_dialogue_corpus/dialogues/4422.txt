Identity was on T.V. last night.
What's that?
A movie. Didn't you ever see it?
I don't think so.
John Cusack and Ray Liotta are in it.
No, then I never saw a movie with the two together.
Great film. Look for it.
Is it a thriller or action?
More of a thriller. Really has a twist to it.
Well you got me interested in it. I'll watch it.
