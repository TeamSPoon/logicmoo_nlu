What's your least favorite DC movie?
Oh that's not hard at all. Green Lantern was terrible.
I agree with that. The special effects and acting were horrible.
I wonder if Ryan Reynolds regrets making that movie.
He made it seem like he did in Deadpool. I loved that little nod.
Me too. Now that was a great movie and a great role for him.
I agree. What's your least favorite DC movie?
Probably any of the Superman movies. They were super corny to me.
They really were. But I did like the latest ones with Henry Cavill as Superman.
Okay those I can tolerate, but even though Christopher Reeves was great I don't like the originals at all.
