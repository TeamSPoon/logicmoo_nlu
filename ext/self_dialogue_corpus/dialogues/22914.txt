I think it's about time the Academy recognizes Andy Serkis.
I am in full agreement with this.
His motion capture work is truly incredible.
I can't believe there is no category for that yet.
Time and time again, he's proven that it's an art in it of itself.
Which role stands out the most to you?
I love him as Caesar in the current 'Planet of the Apes' franchise.
So many emotions conveyed through his facial expressions and voices.
Exactly, and isn't that the core of acting?
It really is.  If we can award someone for gaining or losing a lot of weight for a role, then Serkis should surely get one for his performance.
I recently read that there used to be a Special Achievement Award that is no longer around.  Would be a perfect category for him.
Especially if motion capture isn't going to be a category yet.
Which was your favorite Andy Serkis role?
I think of course I'd have to go with Smeagol from 'Lord of the Rings.'
Of course, that is classic.
Not only did he bring Smeagol to life, he also gave us that trademark Gollum voice.
It's universally recognized.
I think it's only a matter of time before they recognize this as a category.
Especially with more CG roles and more actors doing the same.
Even Benedict Cumberbatch did this for his role as Smaug in 'The Hobbit.  It is only a matter of time.
