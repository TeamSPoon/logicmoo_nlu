You saw The Hunger Games, right?
Yep, sure did.  Saw all the movies actually.
So what was your favorite?
I would actually say the original.
I liked Catching Fire myself.
Nothing really wrong with Catching Fire, just lacked some of the gut-punch of the original.
I can see that.  It's always more impacting when it's the first time.
The actual hunting each other part was better and less fanatical in that movie I thought.
Which movies did you not like?
All of Mockingjay.  Both Parts 1 and 2 were dreadful.
Completely agree.  They were just not good at all.
I hated how they tried to make her some sort of great soldier.
Agreed.  That's just not her thing.
And don't get me started on the ending.
I was so irritated by it.
The book ends that same way, but still.
It was just such a letdown.  Makes you wonder what the whole point was.
I think they were getting at that it doesn't matter who's in power, things don't change.
I guess.  Just kind of depressing overall.
Sometimes everything can't have a Hollywood ending.
