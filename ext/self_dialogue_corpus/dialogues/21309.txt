Okay, so what's another example of one of your famous "Good BAD films" that you like so much?
Well, definitely Samurai Cop.
Samurai Cop?
Yeah, it was an action film made in the late 90s that was went straight to VHS but later gained a cult following on the Internet.
Oh, so, I assume Samurai Cop is about.. what, a samurai cop?
Yeah, except he's white, but he speaks "fluent japanese" even though he can't seem to pronounce basic Japanese names later in the film?
Wait, what?
Yeah.. one of the characters is talking about him, "Yeah, he's speaks fluent Japanese. He was taught by masters in Japan."
The "masters" in Japan?
Yeah, everybody knows who the masters are.  Try to keep up, okay?  :)
Hahaha.
So, it's basically a really bad ripoff of a Lethal Weapon where Samurai Cop and this black dude and trying to take down this "gang" of drug dealers and stuff.
Why did you put gang in quotes?
Well, they're the most inept and poorly funded looking gang I've ever seen.  At one point the boss and his men are having dinner at this "restaurant" and you can see a bunch of dirty windows in the background.
Wow.
Yeah and that's just for starters.  In another scene, they're going after the gang's leader and he's got a big old Defender arcade game in his living room.  Clearly something a drug dealing gang overlord would have.
Defender?
Oh, yeah, keep forgetting how young you are... it's an old arcade game.  Used to play it a lot on the Atari when I was a kid.
Gotcha.
And that doesn't even scratch the surface of all the crazy stuff I could tell you about this movie...
