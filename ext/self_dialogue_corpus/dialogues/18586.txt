What's your favorite 70s band?
That's a hard one. Talking Heads?
Oh, I didnt even know they were around in the 70s.
Yeah they started then. But most of their well known stuff is from the 80s, like Speaking in Tongues.
Oh yeah, so you like their more commercial stuff?
I like both. Remain in Light is my favorite album of theirs.
I haven't heard it, but I will check it out. I've seen Stop Making Sense though.
That's a great concert documentary. So what's your favorite 70s band.
Led Zeppelin!
Oh, of course! Which album?
IV.
Yeah that's a brilliant album. Jimmy Page is amazing.
I love Robert Plant's voice. It just takes me to another place.
I'm not a huge Zeppelin fan but I will agree he has one of the best voices in rock.
True. Who do you think currently has the best voice in music now?
Oh, that's a hard one. How about Bjork?
Her voice is very distinctive.
Yeah there is no mistaking her voice. How about you?
I can't think of anyone now who even compares to Robert Plant or people who were big back in the day.
Yeah, Robert Plant, Mick Jagger, Janis Joplin. They dont make them like that any more!
