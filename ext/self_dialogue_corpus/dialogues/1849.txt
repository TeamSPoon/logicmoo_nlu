Hi There.
Hello.
Are you a football fan?
Yeah sure am.
Do you like college or nfl, or both?
I like both really.
Do you like one more than the other?
I like the pros a bit more I think.
Why is that?
The skill level is a lot higher and I like that.
That's a good reason.
What about you?
I like the pros as well but still catch a bit of college games.
Do you have a favorite team?
I like the Falcons.  What about you?
I'm a Seahawks fan.
Oh cool, I like Russell Wilson a lot.
He's the man.
Good talking to you.
You too.
