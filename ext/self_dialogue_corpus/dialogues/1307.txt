Hey are you psyched about this coming NFL season?
Oh yeah. Can't wait to see my team in action.
What team is that?
The Bills.
No offense, but I don't see them doing anything this year.
Why is that?
They had 9 losses last year, and pretty much the same for the past years.
Hey nothing is impossible.
Your right. The starting quarterback; Tyrod Taylor could be replaced.
I don't think it's just a quaterback issue.
I'm just saying, he is a major component in the team and has to step up.
On that note, did you hear the Bills picked up Nathan Peterman?
Has he played on any other NFL team?
No, he was recently drafted from a Pittsburgh college.
I wander how his stats are?
From what I see, there is a close chance he can be starter quarterback for the Bills.
Which one would you want to see out on the field as starter quarterback?
I'm sticking with the veteran quarterback.
A true fan of Tyrod Taylor I see.
Yes. Until his career is over with the Bills.
