What is your favorite type of music?
I grew up in the 90's as a huge Hip Hop/ Rap lover
Who were some of your favorite rappers?
First, you have to start with Dr. Dre and the chronic. Possibly the best hip-hop album ever in the history of music.
The Chronic change things in the music industry.
Other group that I absolutely loved it was the Wu-Tang Clan.
They were also revolutionary and brought something different that I've never been there before.
There songs and lyrics were awesome.
Of course then you have other rappers like DMX and Busta Rhymes.
I was a humongous fan of both of them. The Roughriders anthem was ridiculously great.
When you heard that song at a club it was on. Everybody would get up and dance.
And then Busta Rhymes came out with his stuff. His rap style and voice were very unique.
And you can't talk about wrap without mentioning the Notorious B.I.G.
If he had not died, there's no telling how many awesome albums he could've put out.
His song "warning" is one of my favorites of all time.
And of course she still have Jay Z.
He is an amazing lyricist and has great rhymes.
I have some of the best beats in songs of the 90s.
And then finally Eminem is one of my favorite all-time rappers.
Me too, white or black, his lyrics and rap style or some of the best ever in the music industry.
