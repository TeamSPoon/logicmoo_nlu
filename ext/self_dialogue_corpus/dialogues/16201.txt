Have you listened to Taylor Swift on Spotify
No, did she release a new song
No, she put her music back on streaming
So, nothing new, just the old stuff
Yes, but now I can listen to it while running
I like 1989 but not the older country stuff
Those are my favorite songs to run to
I like Despacito on my workout mix
That sounds like you, it is my Justin Beiber fix
I don't want to like him but I do
Same, those songs are catchy
Yes, they are kinda like Taylor Swift
In what way?
Both are traditional pop singers I do not want to like
I am not ashamed of my taste
It is not fancy though.  Have you listened to the new Katy Perry?
Not really, the singles are not my thing
Yeah, her other songs were more catchy
Swish Swish is not bad
That is probably the best song
