Excuse me sir?
Yes
Could you have your son not play his music so loud.
Sure, why?
I don't mind much, but he plays it too loud from his car as it's warming up.
I've told him
I was wondering
Yeah, he won't listen.he thinks he's a rock and roll star.
Yeah, but he had to realize that he's too loud.
Your should hear how loud his music is inside his car.
Can he still hear good?
I don't know, I'll ask.
Yeah, please have him keep it down.
What if I don't?
I'll go over and make him.
Do it and you'll see.
You'll see.just ask him to lower it.
I will.
Its ok if it's jazz.
I'll talk to him.
