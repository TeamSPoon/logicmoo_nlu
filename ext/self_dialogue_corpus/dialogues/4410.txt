I finally saw North by Northwest in my film class.
That's a classic by Hitchcock.  What did you think?
It was an interesting film.  Not sure I liked Cary Grant in it.
What was your favorite scene?
I thought the field scene was awesome.
Was that where they are in the corn?
Right, where the plane is chasing him around.
Yeah, that's an iconic film moment and staged very well.
Well, Hitchcock is the master of suspense.
That he was for sure.
