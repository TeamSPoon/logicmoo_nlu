Britney Spears might be the world's oldest teen.
Uhm, I see what you mean, but I saw her perform, and she put on the ideal act for Las Vegas.
You mean she was vulgar and over the top, unbelievable and trashy. Like Vegas.
No, I mean she slayed. Her act mixes naive and sophisticated like a gambler who's been losing in that town for 20 years.
Oh. Naive and knowing. She knows all the ways to lose.
Yeah. But not how to stop playing.
But really she's a hard-working highly-trained Southern girl who as brought up in show business. She's a professional.
Right. It's an act. I'm sure she's somone else when she's not working.
I'll tell you though, when she's working, she's the queen of pop. You should go see her. Just climb over all those screaming fans.
Right, and dirty old men like you.
