Have you seen the list of The Best and Worst Dressed at the People's Choice Awards 2017?
I haven't seen the list, but I did see the show. Who were the best dressed?
Jennifer Lopez, Yara Shahidi and Priyanka Chopra were among them. They all looked modern, and very gorgeous.
Oh, yeah! Jennifer Lopez was wearing a gown with an embellished illusion bodice. She looked breathtaking.
Priyanka Chopra looked comfortable yet stylish wearing that peach, fringed dress.
Yeah, it looked really good on her. I bet it would look bad if I wore that.
The Disney star was on the list, too... I can't recall her name. She wore a blush cocktail dress with floral things attached to it...
Oh, the short dress with the black floral sequin-like things? I think you mean Peyton List.
Did you see what Ruby Rose was wearing?
The matching orange suit and pants?
Haha, yes! That's what. With of course, a low-cut, an matching heels.
She looked like  a prisoner. I think that was the goal.
One of the worst dressed were Gwen Stefani.
Oh, yeah. Yikes! What was that? It looked like a curtain threw up on her...
It's apparently a clown-inspired ruffled blue dress with a cut-out panel on the tummy.
And that's not all, she even wore fishnet tights. Talk about topping the list of the worst.
Jodie Sweetin's on the list, too, but I beg to differ. I think she looked amazing!
Yeah, I agree. I guess it's just quite unorthodox to wear a floral ball gown with a leather jacket.
And, of course, Chris Sullivan definitely made heads turn and eyes bulge out of their sockets with his look.
My eyes hurt to look at his pants... paint-splattered pants... I hope he chooses better next year! If he's still invited, that is.
