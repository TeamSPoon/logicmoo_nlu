What was Amy Winehouse's first album?
Frank.  It's more of a neo-soul album.
Is that the one that has the song Amy, Amy, Amy?
Yes.  It's really good.
I'm so sad that she died so young.
Such a tragedy. Kind of like Whitney Houston.
Yeah. They both had husbands who got them hooked on harder drugs.
And both husbands seemed to come out of it unscathed.
Have you heard her duet with Tony Bennett?
Yes.  She sounds so much like Billie Holiday.
I agree.  I also think that Lady Gaga sounds like Ella Fitzgerald.
I think so too.  She really had a beautiful voice.
Well, I think that Amy Winehouse sounds like Billie Holiday because they both had the same drug addiction.
But, they also both had great talent.
I have found some Youtube vidoes of Winehouse doing some older songs and they were great.
I have too. But, I don't like Beattles covers.
I don't either. Solo artists just don't capture it the same way.
The worst, honestly, was Motown sings the Beattles.
Yeah, the styles dont' match.
It's like Drake trying to sing.  Ha ha!
