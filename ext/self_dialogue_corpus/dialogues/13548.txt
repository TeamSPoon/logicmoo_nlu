Who is your favorite jedi master?
My favorite jedi master is Qui Gon Jin, played by Liam Neeson.
My favorite jedi master is Mace Windu.
Yeah, it seems like all the really cool jedi end up getting killed.
I know right? I honestly couldn't believe that Mace Windu was killed because of Annakin.
It really kills me too that Qui Gon Jin was killed in the first movie, I mean come on, It's Liam Neeson.
Well, at least the legacy is about him essentially creating the most powerful jedi, even though he turned evil.
I feel like he was kind of forced to, He became a really good jedi but the council wouldn't make him a master.
Yeah, and the council didn't even want to give senator Palpatine a trial, like they should have, and Annakin was his friend.
Who could even blame Annakin for becoming a Sith Lord.
