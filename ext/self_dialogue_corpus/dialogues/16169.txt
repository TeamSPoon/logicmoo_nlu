Would you consider yourself to be an audiophile?
I'm not sure if I am. How would you define that exactly?
An audiophile has an interest for hearing musical recordings on the best quality equipment that they can. It's an appreciation for hearing the music as it was intended and also the technology of audio equipment.
From my understanding, these people like to spend vast sums of money for really expensive stereo equipment.
That's kind of the stereotypical audiophile. I suppose if a person were really rich and could afford it, they would.
How expensive do these stereos get?
Well, the state-of-the-art stuff for home music listening can get up into the hundreds of thousands of dollars.
That's insane.
In particular, some of the best speakers can cost over a hundred thousand just for a pair of speakers.
I would never spend that kind of money on a stereo. I enjoy music on my Bose system well enough.
Well, nowadays you can get audiophile quality sound for less money. If you have a computer and are willing to spend about 500 dollars you can get a sound setup that is remarkably good.
No kidding? What about the quality of the music or the recordings?
That's actually just as important or even more to an audiophile than the stereo equipment.
Really? What recordings are really good?
Some of the best recordings are from the late 1950s. Some examples are the Bach Goldberg Variations by Glen Gould and "Time Out," an album by the jazz quartet led by Dave Brubeck.
What about more recent stuff?
There are plenty of good recordings from every decade. A good example is the MTV unplugged recordings. The Alice in Chains recording is particularly good.
That's cool. I haven't listened to Alice in Chains in a long time, but they're good.
I would also recommend the jazz recordings of Hiromi Uehara if you want to hear some 21st century stuff.
I might check that out.
