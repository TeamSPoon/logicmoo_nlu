I went out to karaoke last night.
Oh, yeah? How was it?
Epic!
Did you sing anything?
The usually: Rolling Stones and some Creedence.
I love CCR! What did you do?
Have You Ever Seen the Rain.
Classic!
I totally botched the second verse, but it turned out OK.
You should let me know when you go next time.
Oh, I didn't know you were in to karaoke.
Well, it take a few drinks to get up the nerve, but I could totally tear up some Meatloaf.
Meatloaf?!
Yeah, what of it?
Your not invited.
Jerk!
Just kidding. I'll definitely let you know.
Cool. We could do some Blues Brothers.
Soul Man?
Yeah!
