Falco was weird. It was so 80s though. It's the quintessential Europop from the 80s
Not sure if I would call it that.
That was literally the first song in German I've ever heard.
i know that can't be right.
What? how do you know?
Because 99 Luftballons was back in 1983. Rock me Amadeus was in 85.
Oh.. Shoot. Right. I did hear that luftballons song before.
As a matter of fact, i would go so far as to say, it was Nena's popularity singing in German helped Falco to achieve his fame
Like, Americans have liked a German song before, so why not another German song...
Exactly.
But anyway, the way Mozart was portrayed was kinda weird. He was portrayed so odd, childish, and immature. And what's with the laughter?
Eccentric. i think the movie makers wanted to portray his eccentricity.
Yes! Eccentric.
Well. Mozart in his time was an incredibly odd fella. And to go against the grain to write an Opera in German, at the time, was unheard of.
Movie makes an error. Mozart was not buried at a pauper's mass grave.
It is known that he was interred in a common grave.
Yes. Not sure why the movie maker made that error or did it intentionally.
Probably did it intentionally to elicit more emotions from the audience.
But that's a fake emotion off a false idea. That's... violative.
That's a big word for you. Yeah, it's somewhat misleading. But it makes you really hate Salieri.
