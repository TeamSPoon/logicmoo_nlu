Are you going to the Fences show next week?
I am! I already got my tickets, are you going?
Yeah, I'll be there. I'm really excited to see them live.
Me too. I haven't ever seen them live, are they good?
Yes, they are fantastic live. It sounds even better than on the record.
Awesome, I'm super excited. I hate when I go see a band and they sound totally different live.
Oh I know, it feels like you're getting ripped off.
That's how I felt when I saw Blink 182. I feel like they edit the vocals too much on the albums.
Yeah, Tom is actually not a very good singer live.
Right? He sounds totally flat and tone deaf.
You don't have to worry about that with Fences.
It should be a good show then!
How did you feel about Chris's work with Macklamore and Ryan Lewis?
I actually really liked it. I love Macklamore and Ryan Lewis and Christopher's vocals fit so well with what they're doing.
Same. I hope that they are going to do more projects together.
I really liked what they did with Arrows. Did you see the video for it?
No, how was the video?
Really good, it told an interesting story about the burdens and pressures of fame.
I just watched the video for Sunburns the other day. I really like that video.
Me too. Chris looks like an old sailor in it, but its a great track.
