Which was your favorite Disney movie from when you were a kid?
It would have to be Aladdin.
Don't tell me, you couldn't get enough of Genie?
Yeah, between Robin WIlliams vocie and humor and the magic he was always a hoot.
Yeah, but the guy who did Genie's voice in Return of Jaffar was pretty good too.
True, and I loved the little Rambo reference when he tries to fight Jafar, even though I didn't get it at first.
Plenty of pop culture references and shape shifting always made Genie funny.
Yeah, shame about Robin Wiliams, though
Definitely, the world lost a great talent with his death.
That is very true.
