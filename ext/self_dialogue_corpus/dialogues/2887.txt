When does football season start?
Football goes all year long.
What do you mean?
I mean the business of football goes all year.
What happens offseason?
Let's see. February there are regional combines.  March is free agency. April is the draft of course.
Oh yeah, the draft, that is important isn't it?
Yes it is.  The draft process is what keeps the league competitive and allows the league to have parity.
Parity? What does that mean?
It means that any given team can win on any given Sunday.
So it means the Cleveland Browns are as good as the New England Patriots?
Not exactly. What it really means is that the Browns will get the most help from the draft.
So that they can be better in the future?
Exactly, the best teams will, in theory, become worse and the worse teams will become better.
So how long does it take?
The truth is, it can take many years.
So there really is no parity.
Maybe not in a given season, but overall, free agency and the draft keep teams competitive.
So that means, that sometime in the far off future, a team will beat the Patriots?
Exactly.
