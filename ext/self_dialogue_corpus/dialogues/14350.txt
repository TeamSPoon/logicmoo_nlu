Hey, do you know why the Celtics are wearing black bands on their jerseys?
It's for Isaiah Thomas's sister.  She died not too long ago.
He's had no luck lately, has he?
Right?  And out for the rest of the series.
Nice try at a 3-pointer there, Cavs.
Okay, Boston, try passing again.
There we go.  Nice layup, Crowder.
And another try at a 3-pointer for the Cavs.
No luck.  Boston gets it back.
Good.  I hate to say but I have to root for the underdog here.
Nice job, Boston!  Another 3-pointer.
They're fighting again.  Good.  They need to.
Absolutely.  The Cavs are great, but sometimes you want someone else to win.
Nice pass behind the back by Bradley.
Yep, he's got his fighting spirit back.
And Cleveland gets one point for the foul.
And two points, now.
Brown got a little too handsy with James there.
Yep, and now the Celtics are paying for that again.
38-51?  Well, at least it's only 13 points.
