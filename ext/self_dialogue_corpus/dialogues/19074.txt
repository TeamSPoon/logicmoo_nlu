I really enjoy this new song I've been hearing on the radio.
What is it called?
I'm not sure.  I never hear the DJs announce the song title or the artist.
Do you ever use apps like Shazam?
No.  I just like to listen to music when I drive around.
I mainly listen to the news when I drive.
Do you like any particular stations for news?
I like NPR.  Sometimes, they will have music as well.  World music or old tunes.
My public radio station also plays classical music.
Do you listen to a lot of classical music?
Sometimes.  But not when I drive.  It makes me drowsy sometimes.
Who are your favorite composers?
I like the romantic composers.
Who does that include?
Composers like Chopin.
Oh yes, I like Chopin too.
Many people do.  But sometimes I like Wagner.
I like Mozart.
Any particular songs?
I like the songs from the Magic Flute.
