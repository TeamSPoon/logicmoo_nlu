I saw Vertigo the other night.
Not my favorite Hitchcock, but good.
I liked the story line.
Kim Novak was so pretty.
Barbara Bel Geddes had a fun comic role.
She was pretty cool.
I liked the scene where Kim Novak jumps into the water.
It was shocking.
The tower scene was very scary.
A dramatic ending.
