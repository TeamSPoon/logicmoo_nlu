Did you see another Top Gun may be made?
Yes, thats absolutely disgraceful.
Why do you think that?
Some movies should not be touched.
I dont think Top Gun has that status.
Yes it does not.
So why would you make that assertion?
Its been far too long since the last one.
And thats why they revive it.
Yeah but for who?
The audience that watched it last time.
That was almost 30 years ago!
And now you can introduce to the plot to a new audience.
Tom Cruise is just too strange nowadays.
People do not remember him as the normal Tom Cruise.
Thats why they need to walk away.
The Jack Reacher franchise has done well.
OK and so did the Mission Impossible as well.
I still think you leave well enough alone.
Well thats Hollywood always repeating what works
