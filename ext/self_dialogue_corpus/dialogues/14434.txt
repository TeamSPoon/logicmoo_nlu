Did you catch that game last night between the San Antonio Spurs and the Golden State Warriors?
Of course, I wouldn't have missed it.
Game 3 of the series is pretty big one.
Yeah, with the Spurs being down 0-2 in the series this one was cruicial for them.
They really needed this win to stay alive, but it just wasn't happening for them.
The Warriors were just too good!
Did you see Durant last night?
Sure did! He was on fire!
I think he ended up with 33 points. He was hitting everything!
Don't forget the 10 rebounds he got too.
I think injuries were what got the Spurs.
Yeah, with Leonard out, they were hurting.
Popovich said Leonard wasn't playing but I wasn't sure.
Me too. I was hoping it was just talk.
Then Lee went down in the first quarter.
I know! He came down hard on that left knee and didn't come back.
Well, I guess game 4 could possibly finish the series for them.
Not sure if the Spurs can come back from this.
Looks like it's probably going to be the Warriors and the Cleveland Cavaliers in Round 3.
Wonder how that will turn out!
