I just saw John Wick for the first time.
Cool.  Keanu Reeves?
Yes, plus Bridget Moynahan, John Leguizamo and Willem Dafoe.
She was hot in Coyote Ugly.
Right.  It was a pretty cool movie.  Violent.
What happens in the movie?
A hired killer goes after mobsters who steal his car and kill his dog.
What role does Dafoe play?
Reeves' mentor.
Wow, sounds exciting.
