What do you think about the Raiders moving to Las Vegas?
It is a bone head move.
Well, it just breaks down to the money for the owners.
The teams should just stop adding the city names to branding.
It looks like they have no problem moving teams now.
It is just too much.
Business is business.
But, you have loyal fan bases.  People love those teams and to see them leave town is tough.
The nfl is huge revenue, and really, people can still turn on the tv to see the games.
There is just something different about being able to be around the team.
Yep.  When your team is in the playoffs or going to the superbowl, it is different.
You see all the people around town with their nfl team colors on.  It gets really crazy.
When the niners went to the superbowl, you could see everybody in red.  People had flags on their cars and everything.
Having a team local is big.  Watching it on tv is okay, but there is something about having them close by.
The nfl teams moving is just the way of the future.
It just sounds corny to hear the Raiders playing in Vegas.
The Las Vegas Raiders does not just roll off the tongue.
It just does not sound right.
The nfl is betting that the fans will adjust and get over it.
Some fans are not going to like it.  I guess it is just the new way things are being done.
