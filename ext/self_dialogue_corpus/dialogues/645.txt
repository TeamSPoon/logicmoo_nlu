Can't wait to eat at the game.

Green bay packers!
Packers! I don't like green bay!
You're nuts, packers are always in the lead and always look good winning losing.
Man, I'm a cowboys fan, they'de beat packers any day of the week.
Anyways, wanna go to the game with me tonight?
You wanna know what. Sure! Why not.
So did you watch the game on sunday?
Yea, the eagles beat minnosota in it bad, 7-42 score.
That was talked about all over work.
Yea, so pick me up in 5 we must head to the game.
Hey buddy, nice cowboy hat, ready to rowdy up those fans?
Nothing like pissing pissing packer fans off, pretty fun.
Oh,oh, did you here about the giants playing next month near my moms house?
Oh man, i so wanna go, giants are ok, but seeing there tense action is so cool.
Now were at the game, and so noisy, so less on the talk and more watching.
Man, the team looks great, rooting for the dallas and the packers, enemy meets enemy.
Oh, well, who ever wins. By the way I'm going to the consession stand to get some roasted nuts, want anything while I'm there?
No, just going to sit back and root for my home team. Three strikes your out at home ball game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
