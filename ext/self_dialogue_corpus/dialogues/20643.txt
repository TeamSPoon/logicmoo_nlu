Do you remember ET?
Yeah, I swear I remember when ET came out.
But didn't it come out in 82?
I think so, but I remember my mom taking my cousin to see it.
Why didn't she take you if you were a year old?
I don't know.  Babies don't really watch movies.
You were old enough to remember it.
I remember them going and thinking it was a monster.
Did you ever watch it?
Yeah, when I was a little older, my mom bought it on VHS.
Did you like it?
It was okay.  I never liked the part when the science people were coming in.
Yeah, it gets all sad then.
Did you have any of the toys that they came out with?
Yeah, I remember having an ET figurine.  It was a little plastic toy.
Yeah, a lot of places gave out glasses and stuff.
It was one of the most popular movies of the time.
It's surprising a lot of today's kids have never seen it.
Yeah, it's crazy to think that.
Scenes like the one where he is on the bike were so iconic.
