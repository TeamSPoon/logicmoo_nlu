I was really shocked when David Bowie died.
Me, too. I didn't even know he was so ill. Did you?
No, I had no idea. I read somewhere that he tried to keep it quiet on purpose. Just wanted to be private.
I don't blame him. I would probably do the same thing if I was famous.
Boy, he had some amazing moments in his career. The whole Ziggy Stardust thing was so groundbreaking.
Yeah, he was ahead of his time.
And some of his songs are so memorable. Major Tom, or whatever it was called.
Yeah. Changes is one of my favorites.
I loved the later stuff, too. China Girl. Let's Dance.
Yeah, he was so talented. That was a surprising and sad loss.
Definitely. Any other one hit you as hard?
Well, it wasn't quite as shocking, but when Kurt Cobain died, I was really sad. It felt like we had lost so much.
Yeah, he was a ground breaker, too. Paved the way for a whole new genre of music.
Yup. And who knows what he'd be doing now? Probably something cool and experimental.
You know, listening to his music is weird, because it's so powerful and raw and evocative and then the output just ... stops.
Very premature, I think. It definitely feels like a career cut short.
Yes, that's where he and Bowie differ a lot. Bowie did it all. Kurt seems like he could have, but didn't get the chance...
That's a good way of putting it.
Well, they're both missed. Both one of a kind and both missed.
Let's go listen to some of their music, okay? You've got me in the mood.
