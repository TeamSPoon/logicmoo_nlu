What do you think of the upcoming Fate of the Furious?
Personally I can't believe they are doing an 8th film.
I know right? I mean I'm all for a movie about cars, and racing them, but come on!
I know right? Its kind of completely lost its touch.
It's like the entire movie has forgotten the reason why the movie was put together in the first place.
Right? The movie just needs to go back to the basics, fast cars, fast women, and good times.
At least they still have most of the original characters.
Yea, my favorite is Dom, I'm really wondering what is up with him in this latest movie tho.
Yea it really looks like he's going to be a bad guy.
Yea what do you think that's all about?
