Did you see Jose Batista get hit while up to bat last night?
No.  And I thought that is only a controversy when he's playing the Baltimore Orioles.
Yes!  It usually is.  In fact he is playing them tonight; we should watch the game.
I wonder if there is anything brewing between those two teams this year.
Yeah.  There always is.  I wouldn't be surprised if he gets hit between the letters first pitch!
Well, you have to remember they will be more focused on winning then anything.
You never know.  People are people and when they hold grudges, I think that might trump the game.
Not when millions of dollars are on the line!
That's true.  Who is favored anyway?
I think the Orioles have a better record, but have been in a bit of a slide lately.
Yeah, that's what I heard.
I wouldn't be surprised if Toronto took it to them tonight.
Me either.  What time is the game?
I think first pitch is at 7:05pm.
Who is pitching for the Orioles?
I'm not sure, possibly Dillon Bundy?
He's a pretty decent pitcher.
He more the decent.  He is the ace of their staff right now.
Sorry, I forgot Tillman is still down.
Yeah, until he gets his body and mind right again, Bundy is the ace.
