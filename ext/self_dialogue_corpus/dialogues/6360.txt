Did you know that Sleeping Beauty was the last animated Disney fairy tale until The Little Mermaid?
That can't be true.
I read it on Disney's website. There was a 30 year gap between those two.
Wow, I can't believe that. Why?
I guess it was because Sleeping Beauty didn't do too well in theaters.
That's a long time between movies though.
It definitely is. Especially for a classic fairy tale like Sleeping Beauty.
You said The Little Mermaid was the one they did right after Sleeping Beauty?
Yes.
That's crazy. 30 years is a long time.
