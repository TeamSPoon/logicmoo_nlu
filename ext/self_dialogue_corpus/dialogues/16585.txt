Have you heard that new Kendrick album?
Kendrick Lamar?
Yes. It's called 'Damn.'
Is that the album the new single is on?
'Humble'? Yep, that's it.
Man, that's a great song. How's the album?
So good. Basically every song is as good as that.
I'll have to listen to it. I generally don't like rap.
Me neither, but he's really talented and it isn't all the same stuff.
I get so bored of the money-and-women thing in rap.
Kendrick avoids that which is awesome. He's a great writer.
That kid from One Direction is a great songwriter too.
I heard one of his new songs and couldn't believe it was him!
Me too! It sounds nothing like that boyband-type pop at all.
Yeah, it's more rock/indie. His voice really suits it.
You can kind of tell that's what he prefers to do.
Agreed. There's already been some great music this year.
There really has. Any albums you're looking forward too?
I think Lana Del Rey has something out in a few months. She's great, too.
I like her aswell. She has a nice voice.
