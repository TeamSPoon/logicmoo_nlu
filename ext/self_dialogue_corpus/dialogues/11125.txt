Do you like those fashions, that minic years past?
Not at all bell bottoms should stay in the seventies.
Not even the eighties? it was an awesome decade.
Are you joking?, shoulder pads and neon colors, no thank you.
So you would perfer somthing more today.
I just want something new.
What do you mean, like futurisic?
Maybe, i'm just tired of the same old things.
Ok, tin foil hat's and space helmets then.
Ha, Ha, no nothing that far out.
You know what i like, movie costumes when they predict the future.
exactly, if it's so easy for costume designers to be creative why can't fashion designers?
Well tha't true, fashion does seem to be in a rut.
A several year, long rut.
I'm optomistic, fashion will evole soon.
And if it doesn't it can  do what it always does, come out with bell bottoms again and act like it's new.
Sometimes fashion designers put on.. way out there shows.
But none of them ever really translate to the every day people.
Oh well, I for one like bell bottoms.
You can keep them.
