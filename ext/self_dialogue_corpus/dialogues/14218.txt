Do you like Lady Gaga's song called "Million Reasons"?
I love that song, as a matter of fact, I was listening to it in my car today.
I like when she hits the really high notes.
Yes, she has a really good voice. Lady Gaga and Sia are my favorite singers.
Let's listen to one of her songs now. I can pull it up on my phone.
That sounds great!
Let's sing along with Lady Gaga.
Okay, but I really don't have a good voice.
Don't worry, when I go high, you go low.
Okay, let's make Lady Gaga proud!
