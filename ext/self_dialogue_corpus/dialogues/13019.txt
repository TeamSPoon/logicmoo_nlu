Remember in Empire Strikes Back there was that scene with all the bounty hunters
Right, Vader recruited them to catch Han Solo
There was like a robot one, an alien one, some guy wrapped up like a mummy
And of course Bubba Fett
Yes, Bubba Fett. He was a great character.
I wonder why Vader needed bounty hunters to catch Han Solo
True, I thought he had the force.
Must not have worked with Han Solo.
In the end Bubba Fett caught them though, right.
Yeah, he was the one that finally got them.
