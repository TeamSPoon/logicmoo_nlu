So did the Celtics win last night?
Are you kidding me?!
Why, what?
The Cavs destroyed them.
Just in game 1?
No! Both game one and two.
Were the games close?
Ha! Not even.
How bad?
Cavs beat them by 40+ points in game 2
Oh my goodness. Is that some kind of record
Sure is. Largest margin of defeat
Wow. I wonder what all of the old Boston alum are thinking
Yeah, low point in Celtics history
Well they did make it to the conference finals
Yeah, I guess that's true
The Eastern conference is just not very good.
Yeah, only one dominant team - the Cavs
Could also be a bad matchup
Yeah, that's true...bad match up
