Joe, have you ever listened to Queen before?
Of course I have, I know a couple of their songs anyway.
Nice, which songs do you know?
I know Bohemian Rhapsody and Another One Bites the Dust.
Those are classics!  I love Bohemian Rhapsody!
Me too, whenever it comes on the radio, I have to sing along.
Me too, I wish I had the voice of Freddie Mercury!
Yeah, he was so talented.
Have you heard any of their other songs?
I'm sure I have, but none come to mind.
How about We are the Champions and We Will Rock You?
Oh, yes of course I've heard those.
Did you know that Queen did a soundtrack to a movie in the 80s?
No, I hadn't heard that before.  What movie was it?
Flash Gordon
Oh, like the comic book Flash Gordon?
Yes, the movie wasn't very good, but I like the music.
That's cool!  Too bad I never got to see them play live, I bet it was amazing.
Well, they still tour, but with a different lead singer.  He's ok.
Interesting, I bet it's a hard job to try to sing Freddie's parts!
