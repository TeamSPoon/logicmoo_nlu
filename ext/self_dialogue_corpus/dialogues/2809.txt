Did you watch the NFL draft closely?
Fairly. I tend to skim it over for the most part.
Same here. Who do you think had the best draft this year?
I'm gonna have to go with the 49ers or the Browns.
They both did very well with what they had available.
The Browns played it especially well I felt.
Yeah, they didn't spend too much and they got Garret.
They also ended up grabbing that Notre Dame quarterback.
Yeah, DeShone Kizer is his name.
I liked that they didn't overspend and they're in a great position for next year.
That's true. They have something like 5 picks in the first two rounds next year.
That's a very nice spot to be in.
More than enough for them to get a first round quarterback and anything else they need next year.
True. The 49ers played that draft well too.
Yeah, they traded their 2nd round pick to the Bears and still got the guy they wanted.
That allowed them to make a couple more third and fourth round picks, also.
They got Solomon Thomas, right?
Yes they did. That was a highly sought after pick.
They also ended up with Reuben Foster.
That's crazy. I can't believe they ended up with both of those players.
