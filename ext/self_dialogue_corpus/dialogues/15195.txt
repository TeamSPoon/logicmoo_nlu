Have you listened to that new Metallica album yet?
Wait..Metallica relseased a new album? First time I'm hearing about this.
Have you been living under a rock? Yeah, it's their tenth album.
What's the name of the album? Is it any good?
The album is called "Hardwired... to Self-Destruct" and it's not as good as like Ride the Lightning but it's not terrible either.
That's kind of disappointing to hear, the last album Metallica relseased was back in 2008. They had almost 10 years to make something great.
Chill out man, the album isn't that bad and plus I was comparing it to Ride the Lightning which is the greatest Metallica album ever made.
Umm you really think Ride the Lightning is the greatest Metallica album ever produced?
I'm assuming you don't agree?
Heck no! Do you even listen to metal bro? Master of Puppets blows Ride the Lightning out the water.
Dude Ride the Lightning has a much better selection of good songs. Master of Puppets is alright.
I can't even have this argument with you rite now, do you even know who Cliff Burton was?
Ofcourse I do dude, Cliff was the bass guitarist for Metallica, wasn't Master of Puppets his last album?
Yeah it was, he was killed in a bus accident while Metallica was touring for the album.
That really sucks, but I'm still not changing my mind about Ride the Lightning being better. You can't overlook the song quality of Fade to Black, or For Whom the Bell Tolls.
I do love those songs but how are you going to overlook Master of Puppets being certified 6Ã— platinum?
Ummmm Ride the Lightning was also a cetified 6x platinum album dude ha.
Really? Well I never knew that.
Now you do. Plus  Ride the Lightning was the last album featuring Dave Mustaine..
I guess that's why I never liked the album. I hate Mustaine.
