What do you think of Mozart?
Amazing.  He wrote most of his music as just a kid.
I know, that's crazy.  I can barely carry a tune as an adult.
Yeah much less write a symphony.
What was your favorite work?
I really liked Jupiter.
Such power, and so majestic.
Yeah it was.
They say his sister was even smarter than he was.
That's amazing.  Being the level of prodigy his is.
Yeah, you know what's great about his music?
What?
The fact it always has this full sound to it.
Yes, it's very youthful and springlike.
I know what you mean.  Not quite as dark as Beethoven.
Yeah, of course Mozart died very young.
Yes at only 35.  It was as if the music reflected his life.
Yeah, he hadn't had time to feel true tradgety through much of his musical life.
Yes, but he did a great job.
Tell me about it.  I always remember the Loonytoons song haha.
