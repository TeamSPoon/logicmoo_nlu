The year the Jets make the Superbowl is almost here.
Not even in your dreams I'm afraid.
No need to rub it in. You know I'm just kidding.
The Jets are looking to be legitimately one of the worst teams this year.
I read that some executives stated that they may be fielding one of the worst teams in recent history.
That team could legitimately go 0-16.
That 0-16 Lions team was not that bad at all. They just ran into some serious bad luck.
I agree. They were a lot better than this upcoming Jets team is
I'm scared about the quarterbacking situation. We seem so lost.
Who even is on the roster? Hackenberg and Petty?
I think so. I don't even know who our third quarterback is. Assuming we have one.
That's pretty unsettling to have those two as your top quarterbacks.
I haven't heard very much that was good about Hacky.
Last I heard he was apparently so inaccurate that he was pelting reporters in the back on accident.
I heard about that story to. I really wanted to hope it was a joke.
They always said he was a huge project. It's showing.
It grows tiresome that we seemingly keep drafting projects. I want prospects, not projects.
What's the difference?
Projects can take years to develop. Time you don't have. Prospects can contribute instantly.
Oh so basically someone like Tebow was a project, while someone like Newton would be a prospect. I understand.
