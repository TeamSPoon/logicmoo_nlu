Lets talk about happy rap
I love happy rap and Will Smith is a good rapper.
Yes he never cuss in any raps.
I loved the fresh prince theme song.
Yes and parents just dont understand was a good one.
Summertime was jamming back in 1995.
Yes will smith did a good job with good music and no cussing.
Just the 2 of us was a good song too.
Will Smith did a good job with no cussing songs that was for the whole family.
He is such a good rapper.
