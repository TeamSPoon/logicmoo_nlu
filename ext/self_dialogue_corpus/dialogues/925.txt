How are the Patriots looking for the fall?
Pretty good! Tom Brady is obviously the best.
I don't know about that. The Oakland Raiders look pretty good!
I don't know a lot about the Raiders. Are you a fan?
Yep! I grew up in Oakland and I have been to a few games.
That is awesome. Who are their best players?
Derek Carr is their quarterback. Have you heard of him?
I don't think so. Where did he play in college?
He played at Fresno State and was drafted in 2014.
Oh wait, does his brother play in the NFL?
Yeah! His brother, David Carr, used to play for the Giants.
That's right! He was pretty good I think.
He was pretty good. I think he was with the Giants when they won the Super Bowl in 2011.
They sound like a very athletic family. How are the Giants looking for next year?
I don't really know. I only know they have Eli Manning.
Yeah, I don't know much about them either.
They are certainly better than the New York Jets though.
Oh definitely. What was their record last year?
I think it was 11-5, the same as the Steelers.
Yes, the Steelers were 11-5 last yer as well. We will see how the season goes!
