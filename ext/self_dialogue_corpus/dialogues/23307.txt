There is nothing on television tonight. What is a good movie we can watch?
Boy, I don't know. Comedy or action?
Maybe comedy. I could use a good laugh.
Did you ever see the movie Get Hard?
I don't think so. Who's in that?
Will Ferrell and Kevin Hart.
No , I never saw them in a movie together.
Well that one is hilarious.
What happens?
Will Farrells character gets framed and has to go to jail.
So does he meet Kevin Hart in prison?
No. Kevin Hart washes cars and is hired to get Ferrell ready for prison.
Why is he a tough guy?
Just the opposite. Since he is African American Ferrell thinks he is.
Kevin Hart is a funny guy.
Well you have to watchc it. There are so many funny parts.
So Will Ferrell thinks he can be trained to survive in prison by Kevin Hart?.
Yea and then Ferrell joins Kevin Harts cousins gang.
Before he goes to prison or after?
Before because he found out that Hart wasn't a tough guy.
