Have you heard that new song by Ariana Grande?
No I really don't listen to her.
Oh, really why?
It's something about her voice that I just can't get into.
I can understand that but she is really talented.
Yeah I know she can really sing her voice just irks me for some reason.
Well if you get a chance to listen to her new song you may think differently.
What is different about it?
It's less poppy and her voice really has a different sound in the song.
Oh well then I may actually like it!
I think her sound is changing a bit since she's getting older.
Yeah sometimes the teens, although talented, come off really cheesy in their music.
Yes, and some never grow out of it.
Like Britney Spears?
Exactly. It makes me so sad what happened at that Ariana concert.
Yeah that was terrible. I didn't like the way Ariana responded to that either so that's another thing that turns me off.
I think it's hard for us to judge celebrities because of the media.
That's a good point. I'm going to find that song and listen to it.
Well you will have to let me know what you think!
I definitely will, thanks for recommending it.
