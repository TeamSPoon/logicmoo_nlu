So do you have a favorite band?
Sure do, Fleetwood Mac is my favorite band. Gypsy is one of my favorite songs
I love them too, my favorite is the Grateful Dead. I love Truckin.
Those were some great bands that started in the seventies. Shame that Jerry Garcia is gone.
Yes. Fleetwood Mac is still going today! Stevie Nicks sings like an angel.
I went to see them last year, the show was phenomenal.
I never saw them in person,I did see the Grateful Dead though.
That must have been an amazing show.
It certainly was!
I wish I could have seen them, I love them!
