do you have a favorite action film?
maybe enter the dragon with bruce lee.
that was good but i liked the one where he fought chuck norris.
that is epic. i forgot about that one.
two of the best fighters ever going against each other.
yeah, and bruce knocked him out.
I guess bruce really is the better fighter.
i wish i could see a real fight between them
especially because there are so many sayings about chuck
bruce is better though
