Who's your favorite band?
Probably the White Stripes
Oh, is that the one Jack White is a member of?
Was a member of.
Oh, they no longer exist?
They disbanded in 2011
Wasn't it just two people?
Yes, Jack and his former wife Meg. They divorced in 2013.
Wow, I had no idea
Yeah, they hit it big in 2007 with Icky Thump
Yes, I remember that album.
But rumor has it that Meg had some major stage fright and they had to cancel part of their tour.
Wow, so they kind of fell out of the music scene pretty quickly.
Yes, and Meg hasn't been heard of since.
Man, they had some really good songs too.
Yes, Seven Nation Army is a classic
Oh yeah, that's a great song.
Sad that they didn't stay around longer.
Yeah, could've done a lot more great work I'm sure
Absolutely
