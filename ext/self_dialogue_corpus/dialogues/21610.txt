Have you seen Angel of Darkness?
No. I haven't even heard about it.
Well, do you like period dramas?
I love them. Do you think I would like Angel of Darkness?
You probably would if you like shows set in the Victorian period.
I love stuff like that.  What's it about?
It's based on the true story of a woman serial killer.  She killed her victims with arsenic.
Sounds interesting.
She killed between 13 and 21 people.  I think she was a nutjob.
Who plays in the movie?
It's that one lady who plays Anna in Downtown Abbey.  Her name is Joanne Frogett, I think.
I love her!  Is she just as good in this film.
I think she is, but I have to warn you that this moving crosses a few lines for me.
In what way?
You know how the British are when it comes to sex scenes.  Sometimes the go a bit far for me.
Is there a lot of skin or something.
Not that.  But it is pretty clear when a sex scene is on because they don't really hide any of the movement going on.
Wouldn't it be great if we could filter crap like that and just enjoy the movie?
I know what you mean.  I almost didn't finish it, but the story intrigued me.
I think I will take a look at it.  I love a Victorian mystery.
