Do you know what ludacris' real name is?
I have no idea
Christopher Brian Bridges
Thats a long name
It seems like rappers always have these dorky names
Maybe or maybe we are just so used to their rapper name
That their real names seem dorky
That could be it
Ludacris is better than chris bridges
Thats so true
