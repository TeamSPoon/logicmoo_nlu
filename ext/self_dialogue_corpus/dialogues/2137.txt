Do you following the NFL?
Yeah for sure. I watch every Sunday in the fall no matter who is on.
Who is your team?
I'm a Steelers fan.
So it my dad. I'm Patriots all the way?
How did you end up a Pats fan?
My uncle was so I decided I would be do.
I guess you can thank him for that!
I guess so. It is fun watching a team who wins a lot, I'll admit it, but it's hard to say I'm a fan when everyone responds with "bandwagon."
That's true. I'm sure you've heard that a lot.
I do. And then I have to tell them I liked them with Bledsoe was still the quarterback and that helps a little.
That's good. I mean, the Steelers haven't been over the top recently, but they've won a lot too.
For you. You have the most Super Bowls!
True. I can't imagine being a fan of the Bills or Eagles or a team like that.
It would definintely be painful. They're loyal though.
Kuddos to them! I guess I would be to the Steelers too, but I wouldn't like it.
Very true. Steelers should be decent again this year.
Yeah, it is tough to say. No guarantees like the Pats.
Hey, I don't see it as a guarantee. You never know.
Right. Any given Sunday. Isn't that the motto?
