What do you think about the strict tackling rules for the NFL?
Man, I wish they would just let them play football.
Don't you care about the safety of the players?
Well of course I do, but they get paid a lot of money to get hit.
And a lot of them die in their 50's because of it.
Honestly, that's the price you pay.
That's cold man.
Maybe, but the league is so soft now with all these anti-tackling rules.
Like what?
The players used to be able to lead with their helmet and hit "defenseless" players.
So you think it's a bad thing that they can't anymore?
Maybe, I think it takes the excitement out of the game.
I can see that somewhat, but I think the players safety far outweighs that.
I get where you're coming from, but don't you miss big hits too?
I do, I really do.
Wouldn't you want to see them come back.
To an extent I guess, I don't want dead players either.
That risk is always there.
True, but there's no need to maximize it right?
I guess so, I just miss it.
