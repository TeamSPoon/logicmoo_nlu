Who was the actor that played Obi-Wan in A New Hope?
Sir Alec Guinness of course. A brilliant actor who was in like a 100 movies.
Who played Darth Vader? Any clue?
No dude, it would have been cool it was actually James Earl Jones. Man he has the best voice.
David Prowse was his name. He too was in a bunch of films and TV shows.
I do know who played R2D2 though.
Me too, it was Kenny Baker. He was in that movie Time Bandits also.
Who played Chewbacca? I know.
Why Peter Mayhew of course, and he really is a big dude. He's easily over 7 feet tall.
Man those Wookies are big. I bet they have knee and hip issues when they get older.
