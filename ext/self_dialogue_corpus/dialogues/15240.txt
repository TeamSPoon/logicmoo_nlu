Do you ever go back and listen to really nostalgic music from your past?
I love doing that.
I was just listening to Taking Back Sunday's first CD the other day.
I used to play that CD constantly.
I had completely forgotten about it until I saw it in my old memory box.
I used to listen to them and Brand New on repeat for hours.
Brand New was amazing too. Remember Saosin?
I actually saw them live once.
Their vocalist made a new band called Circa Survive afterwards.
Yeah, and Saosin replaced him with another guy.
Who did you see them live with?
It was at the Van's Warped tour, so there was a lot of bands.
Yeah, the flyer for those events are always filled with bands.
That type of music isn't as popular as it used to be, though.
That's very true.
Everything is going electronic now.
I think it's a good and a bad thing.
Me too. New music sounds great but sometimes you miss having real instruments.
Yeah the quality of recordings is crazy now.
Although some people are deciding to stick with the more vintage stuff, I've noticed.
