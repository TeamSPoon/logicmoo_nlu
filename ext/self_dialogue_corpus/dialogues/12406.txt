Are you excited for the new Han Solo Movie?
Yeah, it's not for a while though.
I know, I just want to see him get the Falcon.
And how he meets Chewy.  Best team in movie history.
I know, they had been together forever.
I'd like to see him and young Lando too.  I hope they do stuff together.
Yeah, looks like they were close at one point.
I wonder what tore them apart?  The Falcon maybe.
That seems more like friendly smuggler business.
We'll find out though.
