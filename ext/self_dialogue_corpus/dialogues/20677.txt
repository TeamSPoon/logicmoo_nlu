I hate the movie Mean Girls.
Why? That movie is such a classic.
I know, but whenever I watch it I just find myself getting annoyed with the characters.
Ah. I see what you mean.
I just hate how fake Regina George is, and then Cady ends up just like her!
Yeah, but at least Janis and Damian were pretty cool.
Yeah, I guess you're right.
Did you ever end up watching Mean Girls 2?
No, I've never heard about it.
It didn't have a theatrical release. It premiered on ABC Family.
Oh really. Was it any good?
I thought it was pretty good for a television film.
Some of these television movies nowadays are not so bad.
I agree. I loved Big Driver.
Me too. Maria Bello was so good in that movie.
The cameo by Joan Jett was nice as well.
Totally. Did you ever see A Good Marriage?
No. What is that one about?
That one is based on a Stephen King novella just like Big Driver.
Wow. It must be so cool for him to see his books brought to life on screen.
