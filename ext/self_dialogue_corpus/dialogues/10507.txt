Guess the song.
Go on.
"Staking in a park"
I need more.
How about the year?
That may help.
1987
Hummm. Is it by Duran Duran
Yes, if I give you more clues, you'll guess.
Is it "food on me"?
Yes
That's a good jam
I love to dance to that.
I never have, but I guess so.
There was a lot of dance music then.
Yup, the 80's
Do you like music videos?
Not really? How about you?
Yes,I dig them
I guess they are ok.
