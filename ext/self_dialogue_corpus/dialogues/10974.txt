There's a lot of traffic today because of the NCAA finals.
Oh, is that right?  What is the NCAA?
It's the college men's ice hockey.  You have never heard of it?
No, didn't even know there was such a thing!
Yeah, I am pretty stoked.  My alma mater is in and I got free tickets.
Nice!  Which school did you go to?
I went to the University of Denver.  Will definitely be supporting the the Pioneers tonight!
Great!  Who are they playing?
Minnesota Duluth.
Are they any good?
I think it will be a good game.  Very excited for it.
How did you score free tickets?
My college buddy's son is playing for Denver.  So it would be an even sweeter victory if we won.
Wow!  What time is the game?
Starts at 7 tonight.
You going with anyone else besides your buddy?
Yeah, his whole family are ice hockey fans.  Grew up in Michigan.  So there are 10 of us going.
That sounds like a lot of fun!
Yep.  Definitely will be!
Good luck to you and your team!
