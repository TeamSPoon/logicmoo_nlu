have you ever seen the movie Seven Samurai
no, what is it about
oh its a classic black and white film about 7 samurai who defend a village against bandits
I don't really watch black and white films
you should really check it out. I lot of westerns are based on  Seven Samurai
that sounds pretty interesting
plus its directed by legendary film director Akira Kurosawa
i have definitely heard that name
One of the samurai has this crazy long sword, you have to see it to believe it
is there a lot of action in it
its a long movie, and there is some action, but a lot of time is spent building up in between pivotal scenes
how long is it
its about three and a half hours, so you might need to set aside some time for it
that is really long
yes, but its well worth it. plus the music is incredibly immersive
i might need to do watch it in parts
if you can make it to the end, the final battle and conclusion of the film are well worth it
what happens?
I leave it to you to watch, but the seven samurai do battle with over 40 raiding bandits in the climax
I might need to move this to the top of my watch list!
