Have you ever heard of Bo Burnham?
Bo Burnham ... Bo Burnham ... sounds familiar. He's a musician?
Kind of ... he's like a hybrid between comedian and musician.
Interesting, what are some of his songs that I might know?
Well, probably none of them to be honest with you.
Haha, okay well which ones should I check out.
Okay there's this one that's really catchy and really clever called 'Words Words Words.'
Oh, isn't that a quote from Hamlet?
Yes! See he's so smart, I've been listening to that song for years and still sometimes catch something new.
Okay cool, so does he do concerts and stuff.
Well I guess he does more like ... stand up comedy?
But his songs are still good?
Yeah, and his songs even sometimes are really deep. He's got this one called Art is Dead.
Oh wow, that's really cool! I have to give him a listen then.
You really should. Any musicians you have to recommend?
Like comedian musicians?
Sure, why not.
Well Adam Sandler was really funny with his comedy music.
Oh yeah?
Yeah, watch 8 Crazy Nights. It's really funny and I still remember all the songs from it.
