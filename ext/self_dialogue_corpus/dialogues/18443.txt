Do you know who I just saw on a commercial?
Who?
Boyz II Men?
What kindo of commercial was it?
I don't know.  I think it was for a digestion medicine.
Okay, well that's weird.
Right?  It's like they are getting old.
Well, they probably are close to forty.
I know, but it seems weird that Boyz II Men is doing a commercial about upset stomach.
I bet it was weird, but I'd love to see it.  It sounds super funny.
Yeah, they were singing about having gas.  And it was perfect harmony.
Well, at least they still got it!
Yeah, one of the guys was missing.
Which one?
I couldn't tell.  It caught me off guard.
I bet.  I wouldn't expect them to be in that.
Ten years from now, I bet NSync will be doing the same thing.
No, I don't think Justin would need the money.
Maybe not, but I can see the other guys doing that.
Oh yeah.  Especially Joey!
