Is Markelle Fultz that much better than everyone?
I'm not sure Lonzo Ball seems pretty good too.
Yea, I just don't know much about those top guys.
I know Lonzo Ball has a crazy dad.
He sure has that. What is with that guy?
I don't know man. He's a little too confident in his kid.
Just a little bit. Its ridiculous.
Yea, I agree. I feel bad for the kid.
I don't. He's about to get paid.
Yea, he is in a big way, but I don't know if he will live up to it.
We'll you never know with these guys. You just cant.
That is true. Its all a gamble.
Yea, thats why its called a draft.
I agree. Hopefully the top 3 at least are gamers.
Yea, we will find out in about a month.
Yea, about that. I just hope the sixers get a good player.
They should at number 3.
Yea, no Fultz, but thats okay.
Seems like the top ten is pretty good.
Yea, but usually a few don't pan out.
