Hey, are you going to see the new Spiderman movie?
Are you kidding me?  I love Marvel movies!  I'm going to see it on the night it comes out!
What's your favorite Marvel movie?
Probably either the first Iron Man or the Avengers.  Anything except Iron Man 3.
What was wrong with Iron Man Three?  I liked it.
They switched directors.  It was too different from the other two movies.
I thought Jon Favreau was in Iron Man 3.
He was, but he wasn't the director.  Iron Man 3 was just way too long for me and I thought the ending was cheesy.
I forget, what happens at the end?
He destroys all his suits and gets into a relationship with his assistant.
Oh wait.  Maybe I'm thinking of a different movie.  That doesn't sound right.  ...how can he destroy all the suits at the end?  Doesn't he wear a suit in Spiderman?
See, that's what I'm talking about!  Iron Man 3 doesn't fit with the rest of the movies!
So how does he get his suit back for Spiderman?
I assume he builds a new one.
Is he still with his assistant girlfriend?
No, Gwenyth Paltrow's contract ended so her character is "taking a break" from Iron Man.
That's a shame, I really like her.  But at least Robert Downey Jr. and Jon Favreau are in Spiderman, right?
Yeah, it looks like it's going to be a lot of fun.  Want to see it with me?
Sure.  Do they have it available in 3D?
I hope so!  I hear they spent a ton on the special effects.
