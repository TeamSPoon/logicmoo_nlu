Seen any good films lately?
Well, I saw The Girl On The Train, that wasn't too bad I guess.
Huh.. what was that about?
Well, this girl, she rides a train everyday and passes by this particular house where's she's speculating about the lives of the couple that live there, also she spies on her husband and his new life who lives next to said couple.  Eventually someone turns up missing and she gets involved and so on.
Huh.. sounds interesting.
Yeah, it's a bit confusing though, because they keep bouncing back and forth between three different characters, two of which look rather similar and the main narrator is an alcoholic so we (the audience) can't rely on what she's experiencing.
Ahh.. yeah, the Unreliable Narrator.  You see that sometimes in books and stuff.
Neat you say that, cause this movie is actually based on a book.
Really?
Yeah, I believe the original story takes place in London.
