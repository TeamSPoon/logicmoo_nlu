Did you see the new Disney movie "Moana"?
Yes! I loved it, what did you think?
It was good. I liked the tropical setting and thought the characters were pretty interesting.
Yeah, me too. I really liked those little coconut guys, what were they called again?
Kakamoras!
Yes, that's it. They were too cute, and I loved that song they sang.
The movie was full of great songs. Disney movies usually are though.
Ain't that the truth. Every time I go and see a new Disney movie, I end up humming the songs for days!
I hope they make a sequel to "Moana," I thought there was more story to tell.
Yeah, that would be great!
