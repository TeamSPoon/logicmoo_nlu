Have you seen the Apple Airpods commercial?
Yeah, why?
It has an awesome song.
What's it called?
Down, by Marian Hill
Aw yeah, that one's pretty cool.
Yeah my favorite part is when the dancer puts on the pods, and starts dancing to it. He just floats everywhere.
That is pretty cool! I barely remember that.
Yeah. Even though the airpods themselves suck, the commercial is still pretty cool.
Didn't that air during the superbowl.
That's right. I imagine Apple spent a lot of money on that commerical.
It's funny that Marian Hill probably benefitted the most from that commerical.
You're probably right. Let me check her numbers. Yeah wow, she started trending after that.
Makes sense, Down is a pretty catchy song.
Not to mention it's really unique. It has an awesome drop.
Not to mention it's smooth.
Right. Too much electronic music nowadays just focuses on the drop.
Yeah I agree. The parts in between are boring, and you're just waiting for the drop.
I'm looking forward to Marian Hill's stuff in the future.
Me too!
