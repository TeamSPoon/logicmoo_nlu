Who do you think will make the NBA finals this year?
I assume it will be Cleveland and Golden State again.
I heard that the same two teams have never met in the NBA finals three consecutive years.
That's pretty interesting. I didn't know that.
Yeah, but I agree with you. Those two are the best again this year.
I guess someone could get injured.
That's always a possibility.
But both teams have been blowing through the early rounds with no trouble at all.
Yeah, I've barely even watched their games because I knew they would be blowouts.
I wonder if the Spurs will give Golden State any trouble?
Well, they'll certainly be more of a challenge than Utah and Portland.
Yeah, those series were a joke.
San Antonio can never be counted out.
They're kind of like the Patriots of the NBA.
Right. Popovich is a lot like Belichick.
Yeah, he always finds a way to make things work for the team.
I really hope we get to see the Cavaliers and Warriors again though.
I know. That's the matchup I think most people want to see.
If everyone stays healthy we'll be seeing round 3 soon enough.
Let's hope so!
