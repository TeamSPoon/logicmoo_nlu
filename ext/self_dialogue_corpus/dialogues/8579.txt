What do you think of U2?
I like them.  They have been able to reinvent themselves and stay popular.
Have you seen them in concert?
Yes, I saw the Joshua Tree Anniversary Tour.  It was awesome!
Who is your favorite member of U2?
I know Bono gets lots of attention for his charity work, but the band would not be U2 without The Edge's guitar mastery!
What is your favorite song of theirs? I love One and Bad.
I love Beautiful Day, Pride, and Where the Streets have No Name.  I think All you Can't Leave Behind is their best album.
What other concerts gave you been to?  I would like to see Coldplay.
I think Coldplay is overrated!  I love  Mumford & Sons.  I have seen them twice.  I saw Fleetwood Mac two years ago.
