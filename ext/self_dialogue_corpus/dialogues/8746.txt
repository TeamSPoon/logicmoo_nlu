Who is the greatest rock band of all time?
Is that a question or statement?
Oh, haha.  Yeah, the Who is pretty great, but I don't know if I'd say they're the greatest.
There are a lot of contenders, but my vote goes with Led Zeppelin.
I would definitely agree with that-- I loved how their sound evolved.
Yeah, they started with a very bluesy sound, and ended up being a precursor to heavy metal.
What's your favorite Zeppelin song?
I'm going to go with the Rain Song.
Great choice.  Best Album?
I'll say Led Zeppelin 4, also known as untitled, sometimes wrongly referred to as Zoso.
