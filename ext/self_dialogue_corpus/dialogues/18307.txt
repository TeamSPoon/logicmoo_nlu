Do you know who has a new album out?
Who?
Night Ranger.
Really?
Yes, they are going on tour too.
I saw them in the 80's.
Let me guess, in 1985?
Yes.
They have so many great songs.
Sister Christain and Don't Tell Me You Love Me really made their careers.
They did.
Are they playing around here?
Yes, actually at The Kirby Center I think.
We should go.
We should.
I don't know any of their new stuff.
Me either.
Maybe I"ll get the CD.
I heard one song, Somehow Someway. It was good.
Then we will go.
