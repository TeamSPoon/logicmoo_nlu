who is your favorite director?
probably tim burton
scissorhands is a classic!
all of his johnny depp movies are great to be honest.
i agree. they are a power couple
and tim's wife too!
yeah, she is in a bunch of his movies.
like the barber shop one.
i wonder if he will make another classic
i think so.
he has a lot of years left, I think.
hopefully he stays around and makes more grown films
yeah, i didnt care for his kiddy movies.
like frankenweenie
yeah, that was no good.
it was like a nick or disney movie, right?
i think it was disney.
It needed more johnny depp
probably.
he can save any movie
