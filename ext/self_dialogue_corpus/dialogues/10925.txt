Are you interested in ice hockey?
No, I hate sports
Well, it's fun to watch hockey because there are usually fights
I suppose so, if you like that sort of thing
Well, it's a way to relax for me
Yeah, OK.  I just don't care for violent sports I guess.
It's better for men to take out aggressive impulses by watching sports than through war
I suppose
It is a theory of redirectd aggression
Yeah, maybe.  But what if it makes you more likely to be violent by rewarding the enjoyment of violence?
I hadn't thought of that, but I enjoy ice hockey, it's fast paced and fun
Well, I'm not saying you shouldn't, just that it's not my thing
You should watch a game with me sometime, you might change your mind
I doubt I would, but if there's a pizza involved I'd be up for it!
I'll see what I can do, what about next Friday
I will have to check my calendar and get back to you
I hope you give it a try, I can explain the rules as we are watching
OK, well, if I can make it I will
Sounds good, hope to see you then!
Bye
