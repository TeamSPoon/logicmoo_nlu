Hey what kind of music are you into?
Oh i like all kinds
Yeah, everybody says that, but really...what do you like like?
I like indie pop folky stuff a lot. I listen to a little classical sometimes too
Cool. I have eclectic taste myself. I love genre bending stuff.
Hey, me too!
Name some of your favorite artists
I like Sean Lennon and Beck and Sufjan Stevens and Alicia Keys and Philip Glass
Cool, i like some of those too.
Do you play any instruments?
I do. I'm not great at either but i play piano a bit, and used to play guitar, but not so much these days.
Nice. I never learned to play anything and i regret it.
Hey it's truly never too late. I didn't really start playing piano til i was thirty eight!
Wow, really?
Yeah, i took a few lessons as a kid, but i never got very far with them.
I wish i'd taken lessons when i was younger.
It's never too late. I'd be glad to give you some free lessons to get you started if you're interested.
Sure that would be awesome. I would want to try guitar first.
Cool. I have an extra guitar you can borrow if you don't have one.
Awesome, thanks!
