Hey, I was just listening to some Pink Floyd.  Do you like them?
They're allright.  I haven't heard them too much.
Their music is definitely unique!  You should listen to them more.
What do you like about it so much?  I always thought they were a little weird.
Oh, I think The Wall is one of the best albums ever released!  Their uniqueness is what makes them so great.
They're from London, right?  Like the Beatles and the Rolling Stones?
Yes, they are from the same time and same place.
I am not as wild about that style of music.
You just aren't appreciating it.  Wish You Were Here is one of the most beautiful songs ever produced.
Yeah, I do like that one.  But a lot of their stuff just sounds too bizarre to me.
Well, it can go in that direction, but think of it as relaxing music to listen to.
To me it's just lacking a beat.
Well apparently a lot of the world disagrees with you.  They're in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.
Oh, I didn't know that.  But yeah I know they're pretty popular.
The Dark Side of the Moon was another album that was great.
Yeah, I've heard of that one, too.
It was on the Billboard chart for over fourteen years.
Wow, that's unbelievable.
Yeah, see what I mean?  They are a talented group with great music for sure.
Well, maybe it's just not my style.
