The one thing I dislike the most about the PC cafe that I go to is the loud music.
Don't you wear headphones when you use the computers?
Yes, but they play the music at too high of a volume.
Is it at least music that you like?
No, it's annoying dubstep.
I like some dubstep.
Me too, but the kind they play at the PC cafe is obnoxious and not good.
Can you listen to your own music to block it out?
That's what I've been doing lately. I usually listen to hip hop when I play games.
Old school hip hop? Or newer stuff?
Mostly newer, like Migos and Travis Scott.
That's interesting. I have seen a lot of criticism revolving around those artists.
Sometimes you need to separate the artist from the art, I guess.
What else do you listen to when you play games?
I've been listening to a lot of Kendrick Lamar.
I like him. What do you think of his newest album?
I like it. I think he managed to pick up a new persona.
Really? I feel he is falling back to his roots.
Maybe so, but his music is a reflection of his present self.
That's very true.
