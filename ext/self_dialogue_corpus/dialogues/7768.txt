Have you watched any Harry Potter movies?
I watched all of the 8 movies in the theater indeed.
That's a big surprise. Which one do you like most?
I like the one titled "Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban", although I know many people do not like it very much.
I do not like it either. I think the storyline is somehow not good for children.
Too scary? Not really indeed. It has time travel part which is fantastic.
But the scenes of Dementors in the movie are really scary.
I see. What is your favourite Harry Potter movie?
The first one, the Sorcerer's Stone.
I like the first one too. It introduces a new magic world to the audience.
