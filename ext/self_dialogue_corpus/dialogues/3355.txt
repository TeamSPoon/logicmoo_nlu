Have you seen the movie It Comes At Night?
Yes, and I didn't like it at first.
I had the same reaction, but than I decided to dig deeper?
What do you mean, what did you find?
I found that the ending was supposed to give a feeling of being unresolved.
Is that so?
It involved true terror and some questions were never answered.
I get you, like who was the original carrier of the illness.
I wondered if the baby was even sick at all.
So this was the intention of the filmakek to leave us questioning.
