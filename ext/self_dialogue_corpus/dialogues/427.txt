I heard the Chiefs are looking for a new running back.
They should could use one and defensive end too.
Do you think inflate-gate was something real?
I don't like the Patriots that much but I don't think letting a little air out of the ball is going to matter.
Do you think New England will win the Superbowl again?
I don't know who else is going to knock them off, maybe the Cowboys.
Are you sick of all the pink gear in the NFL?
Nah, that's OK, I'm just sick of all the politics and the high ticket prices.
What happened to ESPN?  The can't even talk football without some political slant.
Yeah, I'm sick of it.  They should stick to the game.  People watch the NFL to get away from politics.
Do think the Browns will ever win the Superbowl.
Yep, as soon as pigs fly and hell freezes over.
I think the Chiefs are going to be better this year.  They haven't lost anyone major.
They should.  They finished strong but they still have an anemic offense.
It's not fair.  New York has two NFL teams and they both suck
The Giants aren't all that bad if you can stand the fans.
I heard Kaepernick went to Chad or somewhere in Africa.
That's a good place for him.  Nobody wants him in the U.S. except the flag burning types.
The Lions traded for a new defensive end.
They need guards and tackles.  Their offensive line is like Swiss cheese.
