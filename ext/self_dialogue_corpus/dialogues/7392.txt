I saw on the cover of Entertainment Weekly that Emily Blunt is the new Mary Poppins.
I know, I can't wait to see it.
I was totally in love with the original.
Oh, Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke dancing and singing. I adore them!
I heard they wanted Julie Andrews to do a cameo in the new movie but she said no.
Yes, she wanted it to be Emily Blunt's time to shine, She's so sweet that way.
I wonder if Dick Van Dyke will show up in a cameo?
I hope so, that would be great.
And he can still dance, I saw him on TV last month.
He's the best.
