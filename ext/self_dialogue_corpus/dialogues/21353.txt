I think I am getting tired of comic book movies.
Why do you say that?
There are just far too many movies based on comic books coming out.
I wouldn't disagree.  There are a lot of comic book movies coming out.
Do you think that the superhero bubble will burst soon?
I think people may become a bit tired of them, but I wouldn't go that far.
Why not?
Superhero films and television shows have been around for decades.
Yes, but the previous movies and television shows haven't been as popular as they are now.
That is true.
Just as we saw vampire-influenced movies lose popularity, you will see superhero movies lose popularity.
I look at the comic book movie genre just as I do the action movie genre, sci-fi genre, or crime genre.
What do you mean?
Every year we have action movies or cop dramas that come out, yet there is still an audience for those movies.  People have not abandoned those genres.
I see what you are saying.
Also, I think if you create these movies right, you can constantly create fresh material.
Yes.  The worlds of the comic books are definitely filled with a lot of different stories that cover a lot of subject matter.
You can create a spy drama, a movie about Norse gods, greek gods, horror.  The list goes on.
I think it will take the right directors and writers that are willing to take risks with the story.
Agreed.  You have to change it up or it can certainly grow stale.
