I need to find some decent study music.
What do you consider study music?
Mostly instrumental songs, although I can also listen to foreign language music without getting distracted.
What about Rammstein?
That's already on my list. I've listened to them too much lately and need something new.
Try YouTube. There's a ton of free music on there.
But don't you get bombarded with all those ads?
Only occasionally. But for hours and hours of free playlists, it's worth it.
What sort of music do you listen to on YouTube?
I like Gregorian chants. Those are good for background music that you don't really have to pay attention to, but it's just sort of always there.
Sounds perfect! Can you send me a few links?
I could, but you could just search for study music, relaxation music, or stuff like that.
Thanks for the tip. I definitely work better with a little background noise, but nothing too distracting.
Sometimes I can tolerate lyrics when I'm studying or working. PJ Harvey can be good for that.
Ever listen to Enya?
As embarrassing as it is to admit this, yes. Yes, I do listen to Enya.
I'm sorry to say that I do, too. But only for studying.
Totally. Please don't ever tell anyone I listen to Enya.
Sure thing, right back at you. Do you like the Memory of Trees?
Yeah, but it gets annoying after a while. I often just put Boadicea on repeat, since there's really no actual words to that, just humming.
