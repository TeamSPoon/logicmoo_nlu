I just saw "Brave" on Netflix.
Yeah? It's an interesting movie. Did you like it?
It's ok, it's like a different take on the classic "Princess" storyline.
I thought it was interesting how her mother turned into a bear.
Right?! That was weird. But why was I so ready for her to ride her "Mother Bear" into battle.
I thought the same thing, or at least use the mother in a fight.
You know the princess, Merida, was played by Kelly Macdonald.
Cool, I didn't know that.
Yeah, she did a good job, you could really hear the emotion in her voice.
I think all of the voice actors did a good job.
