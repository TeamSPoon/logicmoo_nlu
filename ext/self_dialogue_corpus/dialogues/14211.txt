I heard Lady GaGa is going on tour this year!
I guess that means she's not going to be on American Horror Story again.
Yeah, probably not, but I'd rather see her live.
Same here. I haven't seen her live since her debut.
What songs would you want to hear?
I'm hoping to hear some of the stuff off of Artpop.
Same! She ignores that album sometimes.
And I want some really crazy and cool costumes.
Well she always brings really cool sets and costumes on tour.
You're definitely right about that!
