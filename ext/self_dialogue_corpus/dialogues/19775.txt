Do like the singer Lorde?
Well, yeah I liked her first song, Royals That was super different.
I liked that one and Team and Tennis Court too.
Didn't she have a song in one of the Hunger Games movies?
Think so. Maybe it was Flicker Beat?
That's right. She had a lot of hits and she's so young.
I think she has an album dropping this month. Looking forward to it.
One of the songs has already released. Green Light.
Oh yeah, shes so interesting musically. How would you describe her music?
Hmmm. Hard to say but maybe art pop, indie tronica. drea,m pop.
She defies categorization.
That's probably why I like her so much!
Lorde is such a majorly accomplished singer,musician and she isn't even 21 years old yet
Is Lorde from England or Australia?
Actually she's Croatian and from New Zealand.
She's won so many awards so young and I think she has staying power.
Something like  31 awards and 82 nominations not even counting 2017
When's her new album coming out?
June 16 th. My wedding anniversary.
Can't wait to hear what she's come up with.
