I was so happy to see that they re-released Oliver!
Really?  Why?
I remember seeing it in the theatre as a kid but they didn't release it on tape back then.
I didn't know that, I wonder why they didn't release it.
I don't know why, but I know that we would have had it if they did.  My mom even loved that movie!
Interesting.  Do you have it now?
No, but I'm planning on buying it next week.
When you do, let's have a viewing party!
Ok, that sounds like fun.  You bring the popcorn!
Ok!  "You and me together, you'll see. Forever, we'll be."
