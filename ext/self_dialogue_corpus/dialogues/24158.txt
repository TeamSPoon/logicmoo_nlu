What's your favorite genre of movies?
I love Italian and European Westerns from the 1960s and 1970s.
You mean like the Eastwood ones with Sergio Leone?
The ones that a layman would probably know are the Leone ones but there are many enjoyable ones besides that.
What are your favorites?
Django, for one, the original.
What do you like about them?
They're like a glimpse into this bizarre other world where English is spoken via dubbing and the picture quality is horrible.
Why is the picture quality so bad?
I primarily watch them via a Mill Creek DVD set with two movies to each side of 20 DVDs. They're public domain copies so the quality is really sketchy.
What else do you like about them?
They're very visceral, every man with a gun is a Grim Reaper ready to bring death upon whoever opposes him.
That sounds like a really cool way to watch.
It is. Also, the stunts are crazy. You never really know what you're going to see.
What are some other movies you recommend?
There's this far-out one called Keoma starring the main guy from Django, Franco Nero, that's really out there.
Where can I see these movies?
Some are available to stream on YouTube. If you look up Spaghetti Western on Amazon several sets come up.
That sounds great!
Yeah, it is, but you have to take the movies on their own terms. They won't always make sense or be any good, but I enjoy them very much!
