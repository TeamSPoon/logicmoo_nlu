Are you familiar with the concept of a desert island disc?
I think so. Does it mean the record that you'd take with you if you were stuck on a desert island and would potentially have to listen to it forever.
Yes, that's exactly it. A strange hypothetical that I don't think has happened to anyone ever, but a fun one nonetheless.
Yeah, so what's your desert island pick?
I would take The White Album by The Beatles. It's all over the place emotionally, musically, and collaboratively.
I like that pick, but there is too much on that album that I simply don't like.
What would you pick then?
That's a super tough question. I'm afraid I don't have an answer off the top of my head.
Quick the plane is falling and you get to choose just one disc.
Okay, okay, okay. Pet Sounds by the Beach Boys, what a beautiful record.
I can see "I Know There's an Answer" being a song of hope for you.
Exactly. The album is the perfect amount of poppy, mixed with orchestral, mixed with experimental, and there is such a genuine feeling about it.
If you had to pull one song off that record what would it be?
That's tough. Probably Let's Go Away for A While.
Hmmm. That's an instrumental song, wouldn't you maybe want one instrumental song on a desert island?
Good point. This makes it very tough.
Okay, again I say, plane is falling, you gotta pick one song to go or you don't get any of them.
Well, I just realized Pet Sounds is also an instrumental track. The eponymous song, I'd drop that one, Pet Sounds, it's not as good as Let's Go Away for A While.
A considerably easier task, but I still will ask: What would you drop from the White Album?
Probably No. 9. I think the avant garde sound collage aspect of it would make me go crazy.
