is it bad that i love childrens songs
no, its not bad in my opinion.
my mom thinks its creepy when i hum them out loud.
o.k that might be a little creepy.
see? people think im creepy!
well if you just sing them out loud to yourself.
you may have a point. i do get them from horror movies.
like which ones?
like from rosemarys baby and the autopsy of jane doe
those are creepy songs bro.
really? i love them though.
the one from autopsy of jane doe freaks me out the most.
really how?
it's just the setting when they start singing just gave me the chills.
now that you mention it, it did give me the chills too.
you see! it is creepy
it may be, but i love to hum them
well, i like to hum songs too sometimes
well, lets both just keep humming our songs
sounds good to me!
