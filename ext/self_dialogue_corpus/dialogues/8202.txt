What are your thoughts on Ariana Grande?
I think that she has one of the best voices in music today.
Totally agree. Even in very poppy songs like Break Free, she is able to demonstrate great vocal range.
Yeah, I would even argue that her voice is better than Adelle's voice.
I totally disagree with that statement. I think Hello was one of the top vocal performances ever by a female artist. I think it ranks up there with Whitney Houston's I Will Always Love You. It was that spectacular.
Hello was a great performance, but I wouldn't say that it was one of the best vocal performances ever. My problem with Adelle is that she'll have one great single on an album that causes everyone to overrate the other songs on the album.
Really? Could you provide an example of that?
Sure, while Rolling in the Deep was a great single off of her 21 album, songs like Someone Like You and Rumour Has It were nowhere in the same league.
What about Set Fire to the Rain? Adelle's vocal range on that song was ridiculous.
I'll concede that Set Fire to the Rain was better than my two aforementioned songs. However, it was still probably not as good as Rolling in the Deep.
