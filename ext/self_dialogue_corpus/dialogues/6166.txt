the indiana jones movies are the best thign disney has done
i certainly don't think so!
harrison ford makes movies and you know it!
yeah, but does he make good movies?
...yikes. okay. go on. what do you think disney is doing right, then?
honestly nothing...
but if you had to pick a favorite!
i guess i'd have to go with mary poppins
are you kidding?
yeah, of course. disney sucks, end of.
