Let's talk a bit about some of these intermediary films. Do you think Rogue One was a proper Star Wars film?
I don't know. What do you mean by 'proper'?
I mean is it a respected part of the canon and up to the same quality as the others?
It definitely is. It's politically a very interesting movie.
You mean because of a group of rebels going rogue or radical?
Yes, that's a lot of it. The Rebel Alliance was fairly regressive.
In what respects was it regressive?
Well, they're really only working on behalf of royalty and other regressive political forces.
And Rogue One showed a better way?
It did. It showed that people who really want to get things done don't necessarily listen to the official 'resistance.'
