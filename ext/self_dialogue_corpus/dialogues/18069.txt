Have you heard Eminem's Rap God song?
Yes and I loved it.
Me too.
Why?
I tried to rap the song but I just couldn't keep up.
I wouldn't even try he's too good.
Do you like any of his other songs.
Lots but I like Stan a lot.
Haven't heard that one in a long time.
Me either might have to bust out the old cd's.
You still have his cd's laying around?
Of course and a stereo.
That reminds me of the good old days.
That's why I keep it around.
The first song I remember hearing was the real slim shady.
That's one of his first big hits.
Yeah, wasn't all of his songs big hits though.
I think so.
He was a superstar in the 90's.
Yes he was.
