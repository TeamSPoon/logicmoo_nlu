I never got to watch the entire Alice in Wonderland movie.
I did when I was little.
I only ever saw pieces of the movie.
I don't remember much. Except I'm late for an important date.
That's funny. Was that the Mad Hatter.
Yes.
What was the deal with the two huge playing cards?
I really don't remember.
Well, some night we will have to watch it together.
Sounds good. I'll bring popcorn.
