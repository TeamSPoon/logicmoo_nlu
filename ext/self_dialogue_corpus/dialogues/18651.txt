Have you heard of the band Wintergaten?
No, I haven't. What are they like?
I think they're German, but they do all kinds of interesting music using machines.
Like what?
They have this one song that's really popular on Youtube called Marble Machine.
Is it actually about a marble machine?
Yes, in fact. The guy built this machine that uses thousands of metal marbles to play a song.
Oh, that's really cool. What does the song sound like?
The machine uses a glockenspiel for most of the stuff, but it also has a bass and drums built in.
That's very neat. Are all the songs like that?
They only have the one song that uses that complicated of a machine, but other songs are similar.
How are they similar?
There's another song that uses a small machine that plays a music box.
Very cool. It sounds like the music is really relaxing.
It definitely can be. They choose a lot of tasteful sounds in their music.
What are some of the other instruments they use?
They use a typewriter for some of the percussion bits.
Wow, I would have never thought of a typewriter as an instrument.
Yeah, the main guy also has an electric violin type synthesizer he built himself.
Very wild, I'll definitely look them up online.
