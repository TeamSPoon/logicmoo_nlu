What's your favorite Superhero movie?
Well, it's got to be Iron Man.  Robert Downy Jr. was great in that.
Yeah, I liked all of the Iron Man movies.  I love how he made his outfit in the first one.
I like that they spanned like four or more movies and kept adding more superhero's.
Yeah, when they created the Avengers.
And brought in Thor and The Hulk.
Who played Thor?  I can't remember.
Chris Helmsworth.  Loved that character.
And Cpt. America.  You know, Chris Evens.
Just watched the latest Cpt. America.  Civil War was great.
