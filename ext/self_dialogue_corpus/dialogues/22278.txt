I just saw a trailer to an interesting movie.
Which was?
Annabelle 2: Creation Official Trailer .
What's Annabelle?
A haunted doll.
Is it supposed to be a horror?
Yeah. Annabelle 2 tells the tale of a doll maker and his wife who, several years after the tragic death of their child.
Let me guess, they make a doll and call it their daughter?
No silly. They welcome a nun and several girls from a shuttered orphanage into their home.
Then what?
They become the target of the dollmaker's possessed creation, Annabelle.
How can you be scared of a doll? It is just a doll, hit it.
I hear you.
I can't wait till the day they make a movie that will genuinely have you scared and not for two seconds like all these jump scares nowadays.
Pretty much every single supernatural movie does that to me.  The Ring, The Grudge, Insidious, The Conjuring, Grave Encounters, etc...all of them.
Not hating on the movie but I don't understand why the doll is haunted.
I'm not entirely sure. It is my understanding that the girl did want her soul moved into the doll.
So if she move into a doll, why is she acting all scary and creepy?
Good point now you got me thinking.
Could it be demon and not the little girl?
