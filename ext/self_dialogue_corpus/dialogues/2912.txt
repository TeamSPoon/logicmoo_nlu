Well, another football season is a few weeks away.
Go Browns!!
Wow, did you get season tickets again?
Of course.  Every year for 10 years.
I haven't been to a Browns game for a long time.  But I do watch the games.
What are some of your best memories?
Monday night football games at Municipal Stadium.  I lik
Did you go to any playoff games?
I saw Cleveland and Baltimore in the playoffs.  Johnny Unitas  was the quarterback!
That was a long while ago.
I miss the Browns from the late 1980's.  They were great.
Under Scottenheimer.
They got within one game of the Super Bowl!
Those playoff games were exciting.
Especially the Jets game.
Double overtime.  So exciting.
So many good memories of great games.
I know.  I just wish the Browns could be in the playoffs again.
Someday.
Someday.  Someday soon, I hope!
