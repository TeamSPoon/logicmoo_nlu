Did you hear about Disney getting hacked in May?
No, what happened?
Some cyber thieves stole one of Disney's new movies coming out. They want a ransom in bitcoins, or they're going to post it on online for people to steal.
So is Disney paying the ransom?
No, they are insisting they won't pay ransom. Someone already stole 10 episodes of a Disney tv show and posted it online.
What movie did they steal?
Disney wasn't saying, but they had Pirates of the Caribbean and Cars 3 coming out soon.
I bet it was Pirates of the Caribbean. There would be a bigger audience for that than a kid's movie.
Probably. Johnny Depp's character in the Pirates movie is pretty popular.
They probably would like that it's a movie about pirates, stolen by online pirates.
