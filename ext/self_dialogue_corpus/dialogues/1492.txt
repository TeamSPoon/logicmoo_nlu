CAN'T WAIT FOR FOOTBALL TO START AND I DON'T MEAN PRESEASON!
TELL ME ABOUT IT.....TIRED OF BASEBALL
ANYONE BUT THE PATRIOTS
MY BUCS PICKED UP A COUPLE GOOD ONES AND BETTER THAN YOUR DOLPHINS
WHAT ABOUT YOUR PRECIOUS STEELERS
CAN'T WIN WITHOUT CHANGES AND THEY DON'T HAVE THE GUTS TO DO THAT
THEY NEED TO SIGN BELL AND MAKE HIM HAPPY
OPENING NIGHT IS CHIEFS AND PATRIOTS
SHOULD HAVE FALCONS AND PATRIOTS REMATCH
NO WAY....TOO MANY BAD MEMORIES EVEN FOR ME
PATRIOTS, COWBOYS, AND PACKERS ARE THE FAVORITES TO GO TO SUPER BOWL IN 2018
PACKERS ARE TOO WISHY WASHY AND COWBOYS COULD WITHOUT QUARTERBACK DRAMA LINGERING
I SAW THE STEELERS PICK UP WATT'S LITTLE BROTHER IN THE DRAFT....WONDER IF HE WILL DO THE SAME
I LOVE WATCHING WATT PLAY AND IF HIS BROTHER IS THE SAME THEN HE WILL FIT WELL WITH THE STEELERS
SAINTS AND VIKINGS ARE FIRST MONDAY NIGHT
NOT A BREES FAN ANYMORE
CAN'T WAIT TO SEE A GAME UP IN PACKER COUNTRY WHEN ITS COLD AND SNOWY AND THE FANS ARE CRAZY!!
JUST READY TO WATCH FOOTBALL NO MATTER WHERE....GO STEELERS!
GO BUCS!  GO DOLPHINS!  GO ANYONE BUT  PATRIOTS!  ARE YOU READY FOR SOME FOOTBALL?????
YOU BET I AM!!  SUNDAY...MONDAY...THURSDAY!!!!
