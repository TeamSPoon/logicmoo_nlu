The Fast & Furious movies have had some great soundtracks over the years.
They have! Do you have a favorite?
That'd probably be Fast & Furious 6.
That film's main theme was so great.
Yes! Whoever calls for these soundtracks really know how to appeal to big audiences..
My entire family was hooked onto that song after we went to see the film.
Fate of the Furious also has a fantastic soundtrack.
That one's a classic for rap fans, mainly.
Exactly why I like it. I'm a rap fan!
So am I!
