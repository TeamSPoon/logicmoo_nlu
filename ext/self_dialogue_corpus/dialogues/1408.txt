Hey, it is July already.  You about ready for some football again?
I am, but I do appreciate baseball.  Where I live at all I hear about is football all year long.
Yeah, you do live in New Orleans...............they love their Saints there.
That they do, but I'm a Dallas Cowboy fan. Cowboys forever.
The Cowboys had a great year last year.  Bet you never saw that coming.
I didn't and hardly anyone else did either.  I would've never though that Romo would not be a Cowboy.
That was a shock.  Dak is where it is at, though.
He is definitely the future.  Hope he stays healthy long term.
Yeah, and hopefully he doesn't go into a sophmore slump because sometimes the rival teams have figured you out in your second season.
I hope not.  I hope he is the Cowboy's quarterback for a long time to come.  We are actually picked to face the Patriots in the Superbowl.
I did read that.  If that is the case, I'm pulling for your Cowboys then.
I hear you.  You get tired of hearing about the Patriots and Brady all the time.
I mean he is a great quarterback, but I like it when new teams win the Superbowl.  I mean, that is when my team isn't in it.
Your team?  It must suck being a Browns fan.
Yeah, I don't go into my closet at night for fear of hanging myself.....hahahaha.........I don't expect much from the Browns that is for sure.
At least they won a game or two last year.  They were barely projected to do that.
Yeah, don't remind me.  I don't know how the Browns will ever turn it around.
Look at the Cowboys, been losing for years recently and now we are preemptive favorites all of a sudden.
Well, we'll see what happens this year that is for sure.
Yes we will.  Good luck to you even though being a Browns fan it's usually bad luck.
