Hey what kind of music are you into?
I'm a really big pop fan. One of my favorite artists is Katy Perry.
Oh I like her, she's cute. What's your favorite song by her?
It's going to sound silly, but I really like California girls. It resonates with me on a deep level.
That's a pretty good song. I personally have always liked Hot n Cold myself.
Do you ever listen to Lady Gaga?
I've heard her a few times, and I liked her superbowl performance. She's always been a little out there for me.
That's true, but I really like her originality with these things. It kind of sets her apart as an artist.
You've got a good point. That's why I like Lindsey Stirling.
Lindsey Stirling is amazing! She's such a great composer, and her collaborations are off the charts.
I really liked that song she did with John Legend. What was it called?
I believe it was a collaboration of his song All Of me. That's one of the best songs of his I've ever heard.
Speaking of, John Legend sure has been busy lately hasn't he!
Yeah I believe he was just on The Beauty and The Beast soundtrack, as well as some other things.
I also saw him on this really long Target Christmas commercial that was pretty cool. He actually did a little acting.
Speaking of instrumentalists, have you heard The Piano Guys?
No I haven't. Who's that?
They're this group that does really excellent covers of songs and they've got some original works and also some collaborations. It's worth looking into!
Okay then I'll have to do that. If you like Lindsey, you definitely have good taste in music.
Why thanks, I'm sure you won't be disappointed. While you're at it, check out Two Cellos on YouTube.
