Who do you think has the worst personality in the NFL?
As far as players go, it's a toss up between Aqib Talib and Richard Sherman
Is it something about playing defense that makes people so unpleasant?
I know people gave Ndamukong Suh a hard time for being a dirty player, but at least he wasn't running his mouth off
I hear bad things about Vontaze Burfict on the Bengals, too
Do you know of any dirty offensive players?
I don't know about dirty, but Odell Beckham Jr. has a pretty bad attitude and doesn't deal well with loss
Well when you play for the Giants, you ought to learn to deal with loss
Steve Smith Sr. had an attitude, I know, but he's retired now so I suppose that doesn't count
Yeah, and he really showed up Talib when he played for the Panthers
That guy had it coming, playing aggressively and taking cheap shots and players
You'd think he would have learned his lesson by now, but there he goes poking guys in the eye
Yeah what was that about?
And then he ripped Michael Crabtree's chain off his neck during a game
To be fair, there's no reason to be wearing flashy jewelry during an NFL game
Maybe not, but that doesn't give other people the right to destroy others' property
I saw a guy get some of his dreadlocks ripped off during a game once
I remember that, and I remember the referees basically saying that players' hair is an extension of their uniform and that grabbing it isn't a penalty
Maybe Aqib Talib is bald because he's afraid his behavior will make people want to rip his hair out
That, or maybe being a dirty player makes your hair all fall out
