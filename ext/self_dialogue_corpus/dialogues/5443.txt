That's quite a movie collection you have there!
Thanks They are mostly all Disney movies.
Disney movies are still my favorites.
Mine too. " I watched them as a child, began purchasing DVD's for my daughter, and now my granddaughter is watching them.
Have you seen Moana?  It's wonderful!
Yes, and the girl who played Moana was wonderful.
She has a fantastic voice.  Did you see her sing her sing a duet with that little girl on the Ellen show?
I did!  They were both great, and the little one was so excited to be singing with the "real" Moana!
And I love seeing the Disney stars have such a good time interacting with their fans.
I'll have to remember to look for a copy for my collection next time I shop.
