Hey, I know we both like the Bucs, so I was wondering if you wanted to go to a NFL game? My treat.
That would be awesome, but what game would you be interested in seeing?
Well, I guess we could both figure that out now.  What other team do you like?
The Panthers. What other team do you like?
Miami; both the Florida teams.
Ha Ha. Miami?
What is so funny?
Miami is horrible, I don't even know why they are still a NFL team.
That is your opinion.
Last year, their game stat was 10-6.
Okay, that does not mean that they did not improve, since last year.
I'm not saying that, but do you remember how bad they lose. Remember the game between them and the Ravens 6-38.
Yes I must say, "that was a big ouch," but the other losses were not that bad. Maybe only a 12 to 15 point deficit.
And you have to admit, they don't give much of a game to watch.
Okay, okay, then what team would you want to see the Bucs play.
How about not choosing any of the teams we both like.
Okay that sounds fair, so I'm just going to say a team and you agree or disagree.
Okay, let me hear it.
New Orleans Saints should give us a good game to watch.
Sounds good to me, I agree.
