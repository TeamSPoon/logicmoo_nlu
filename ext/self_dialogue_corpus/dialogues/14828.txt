What is your all time favorite comedy? Like the one you want to watch over and over?
Easy, The Princess Bride!
I love that movie! I laughed the whole way through it.
I know right?....My name is Inigo Montoya you killed my father. Prepare to die....
What about Wallace Shaun.....it's inconceivable!
It really is...You keep using that word but I do not think it means what you think it means. I laughed every time he says that.
Hard to believe Princess Buttercup is Claire Underwood.
What? Crazy. I did not put it together.
Talk about going to the darkside. Black.
Yeah, Darth Vader is like Mr. Rogers compared to her. I got to go watch that movie again.
