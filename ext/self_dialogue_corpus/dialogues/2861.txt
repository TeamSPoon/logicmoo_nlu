No, I mean if Cook was in a different team he wouldn;t have ranked that high.
Well, I don't know about that. Cooks has a pretty good YAC at 15
YAC is yards after catch?
Yes. 15 yards after catch is right up there with the top receivers
His target/reception is pretty low though. 78 out of 117 targets. That's like 66%
yeah, but that's not really all on him. it also depends on the defense covering the receiver.
TY Hilton's is even worse, at 58%. Yet he's the no 1 receiver in the league
Well, again the target/reception doesn't really tell you much about the receiver.
Jordy Nelson's is about 63% yet he has the most TDs last year at 14
That's because how the Packers likes to score. And Nelson is Rodgers' favorite target for the end zone.
You know what's funny?
What?
The Patriots's no 1 receiver isn't even in the top 10.
Oh, yeah. And they still won the superbowl. Hahaha.
And their RBs aren't that great.
LeGarrette Blount is a 8th ranked RB. pat's running game is on point
The Pats use him to punch in for the TD.
He does have 18 TDs, more than any other RBs.
Does he have really that many?
Yep, the second is David Johnson at 16 TDs. and Then Zeke Elliot at 15
