Have you seen Sing Street yet?
Not yet, I know you've been recommending it to me for months.
You have actually betrayed me by giving me that answer.
I just haven't had the time I promise.
For Sing Street you make the time, it's a perfect film.
See though when you hype it like that I'm unsure.
Trust me, perfect soundtrack, great unknown cast, all musicians.
So the actors play their instruments?
Yes John Carney wanted to make it as authentic as possible.
That's admirable, some music movies are lame when you know they aren't actually playing.
Exactly, that's what makes Sing Street so relatable and easy to enjoy.
So everything else is bad?
Don't be like that, the acting, especially Jack Reynor's character is incredible.
I'll watch it soon I promise, what's it on?
You can catch it on Netflix now, I've watched it like six times since it was added.
That's a lot, it's hard to believe it's that good.
It's just an infectiously good movie, great vibes.
Will I like it if I don't like 80s music?
I think so, taste in music doesn't defeat a beautiful coming of age story.
You have a point, I'll watch it tonight.
