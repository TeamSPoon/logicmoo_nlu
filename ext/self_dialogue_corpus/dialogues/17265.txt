Who had a bigger climb to fame in your opinion, New Found Glory or Fall Out Boy?
Fall out boy
Yeah I tend to side with you on this one.
I mean they were a typical garage band making pop punk records.
Take this to your grave was their best album
Yeah and as they evolved they went more rock.
But they broke on to the scene quickly.
Yeah they only had one album out before they were on the radio.
What was the name of the song that got them huge?
Sugar we're going down, right?
Yeah thats it, it was a good song.
No doubt but it took away from the scene.
I agree with you, it brought mass appeal
Then they broke up for a little
Yeah the band went through alot of turmoil.
That stinks because of their older fans
Regardless they still have an impact on the underground scene.
I dont know they seem to be a joke anymore
People still listen to their first album
It is more of a guilty please for some
