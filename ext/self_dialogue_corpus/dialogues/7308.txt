Have you ever seen Emperor's New Groove?
Yes. I love that movie.
Me too. It's really funny.
I loved David Spade as the Emperor.
He was perfect for it. So was John Goodman as Pacha.
I liked his wife too. That one actress did her voice.
Oh yeah Wendie Malick. I like her.
I liked Kronk the best though. He cracked me up.
Patrick Warburton did the voice for Kronk right?
Yeah that's him. He is really great. I like his voice.
