So, do you listen to much rap music?
I won't lie to you, it's not really my favorite genre, but there are a few guys I do.
Really, like who?
Well, I'm more into "old school" type rap, like Run-DMC, Public Enemy, NWA and stuff like.
Oh, yeah, I listened to a lot of those growing up.
Yeah, for example, really loved "It's Tricky" by Run-DMC and, of course, the duet they did with Aerosmith.
Oh, yeah, both of those songs are classic!  "Walk This Way" was the one they did with Aerosmith.
Yeah, I'm told it really helped bring rap music into the mainstream environment.
Yeah, I remember when I was a kid they used to play that video and "Tricky" a lot on MTV.
Oh, yeah, back when MTV actually PLAYED videos!
