What do you think will happen to Kylo Ren in this movie?
Hard to say.  I get the feeling he might not be as bad of a guy as we think.
He might have some qualities that are redeeming, I guess
It will be interesting to get more of his backstory.
On why Leia and Han abandoned him?
Well, the didn't abandon him, but he obviously didn't grow up how they anticipated.
My guess is they start talking about that in this movie and the next one fully comes out with the why.
I'm interested myself.  It's one of the character narratives we don't understand quite yet.
Only another six months or so to find out!
Yep, can't wait!
