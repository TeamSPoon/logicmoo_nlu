Hey how's it going?
It's going well. How are you?
I'm fine, what have you been up to recently?
I went to a concert to see City and Colour. What about you?
Oh, Dallas Green, he's a very talented musician/songwriter! I went to see the movie Boss Baby.
Yes, he's is very talented! How was Boss Baby?
Boss Baby was funny. I saw it with a good friend.
Nice, I'll probably check it out with my kids.
That's cool, how was the concert by the way?
The concert was great, he's awesome to live. Do you have any other movie recommendations?
Finding Dory, and Pete's Dragon.
Oh yes, those sound good.
Do you have any plans for the weekend?
I'm going to another concert, to see Kimbra.
Ah, I heard she's great live.
She is! This will be the second time I see her.
That's awesome! Have fun!
I will, thanks.
I'll probably just hangout with family.
Have fun with them!
