What's the most recent Marvel movie you've seen?
The Avengers: Age of Ultron. I loved it.
Me too. I loved the character of Ultron. He was so much like Tony Stark it was funny.
Yes, Tony Stark if he was much more arrogant than he is.  It's funny that Ultron really believed he was doing good.
That's how most villains think. I love Scarlett Johannsen as Black Widow. I loved her in Lucy too.
Yes that was a great movie. She was the only one who didn't attempt to pick up Thor's hammer in Age of Ultron.
Right. It makes me wonder if she would have been able to pick it up had she tried.
Vision was able to pick it up with no problem I thought that was awesome.
Me too. That scene where they were all trying to pick it up was hilarious.
Yes it was. I couldn't help trying to calculate how much monetary damage they caused in that movie alone.
