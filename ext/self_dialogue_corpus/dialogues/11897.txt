I was thinking about that Beatles song, "Yesterday". I like the verse "yesterday all my troubles seemed so far away".
It's funny when your young how everything seems to be life or death.
Yeah, but when you look back you only remember the really good or bad times.
It's funny how a song can take you back to your past. I remember roller skating and the song "Don't let me down" was always playing.
I really liked "I want to hold your hand". Seems so tame to the lyrics the kids listen to today.
Isn't that the truth. I guess it does make one think of yesterday.
It really does. It seemed like a wild time but it was really so innocent.
Oh, to have back the innocence of our youth again. Life in the sixties and seventies times were a changing.
They don't have music like that anymore. Music that will be around and still make sense fifty years from now.
I don't know it may make sense to this generation and may make them smile when they hear it again.
