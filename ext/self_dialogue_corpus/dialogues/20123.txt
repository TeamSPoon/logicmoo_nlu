So what did you think?
About what?
The new Star Wars trailer that we just watched silly!
The trailer looked really awesome, but I'm still not that excited to see it.
Really, you? You are the biggest Star War fan that I know!
Yes, I know, I don't know if you know this, but I even read all the non-canonical books as well. I could never get enough.
So what changed?
The movie, A New Hope, kind of killed the franchise for me.
Don't you think that is a little extreme?
No, it destroyed a lot of the original Star Wars mythology for me.
Like what?
Rey didn't even know that the Force existed an hour ago, and now she is using mind control!
So what is wrong with that?
Well, Luke trained with Yoda and Obi Wan for a very long time, and she just "knows" How is that possible?
I never thought about it like that.
Also, she has never even seen a Millenium Falcon and fixes it better that Han! Oh and don't get me started on the "convenient" timing of everything.
But it's Star Wars!
In name only!
So, you don't think that you'll go see it?
No, I will, I'm keeping the faith that they will be more faithful to the story and explain some of the major plot holes.
