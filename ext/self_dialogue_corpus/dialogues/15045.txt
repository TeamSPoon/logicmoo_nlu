Have you seen the movie Zoolander?
Yeah with Owen Wilson and Ben Stiller?
Yep, I love that movie.
It's been a long time since I have seen it.
Well you remember the ending right?
I think so, with the modeling competition right?
Yeah and Will Ferrel trying to mind control Ben Stiller with music.
Didn't he try to make him kill some Asian guy?
Haha, yeah that part is too funny.
I'll have to watch that movie again soon.
