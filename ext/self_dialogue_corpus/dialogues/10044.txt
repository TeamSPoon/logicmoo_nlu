Have you seen "Snatched" with Amy Schumer and Goldie Hawn?
Yes, it was kind of stupid. Goldie Hawn was not funny.
I didn't think so either.  But Amy was good.
Yes, i like the way she runs around telling the kidnappers off.
And they kept getting caught too.
Why were they out in the jungle anyways?
She met that guy who was showing her around.
Oh yeah and he was in on the kidnapping in the first place.
Thats the guy she slept with and danced with.
At the end it was ok when mom and daughter hugged. Otherwise it was a stupid movie.
