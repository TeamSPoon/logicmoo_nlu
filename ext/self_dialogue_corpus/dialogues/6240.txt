Did you like Peter Pan?
Yes and I love the ride at Disneyland too.
That is a lot of fun. Who is your favorite character?
I like Wendy. She is so nice.
I agree. Peter is pretty cool too.
Yeah, I also like their dog in the beginning.
Oh, you mean Nana?
Yes, that dog is so sweet. I like when Tinkerbell puts the fairy dust on it and it flies up a little.
Where does that movie take place?
In London and in Neverland.
