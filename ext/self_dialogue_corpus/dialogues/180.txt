Have you seen the Iron Man Franchise?
Yes I have.
What's your favorite part of the franchise?
Probably when that Russian guy builds his own suit but it's not some big bulky machine like Iron Mans.
Interesting, care to elaborate a big more.
Sure, well at the race track the guy had two electric laser type whips and that's pretty much it.  He whipped those things around slicing cars in half and doing some serious damage.
I rather enjoyed that as well.
I also liked it when Iron Man had a suitcase that put his suit on rather quickly.
Yeah that was awesome.
We should watch it together soon.
