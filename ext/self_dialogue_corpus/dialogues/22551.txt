I like THE BREAKFAST CLUB.
That is a great movie.
It was released in 1985.
It was directed by John Hughes.
It was produced by Ned Tanen.
It was also written by Tanen.
It had several actors.
Emilio Esteves was in it.
He is cute.
Paul Gleason is in it.
He was the thin kid.
Anthony Michael Hall is in it.
Also Judd Nelson is in it.
I liked Molly Ringwald.
She was my favorite.
Ally Sheedy was in it also.
The music was by Keith Forsey.
It only had a million dollar budget.
It made $51 million.
But it is a classic.
