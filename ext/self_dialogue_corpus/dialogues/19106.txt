Were you ever into Maroon 5?
Yeah I was when they first came out. I like that song She Will Be Loved.
Oh that's such a pretty song. Adam Levine has a great voice.
He really does. They had a pretty successful run I must say.
Another group I like is Coldplay. Chris Martin is unbelievable.
I know, The Scientist is my favorite song by them.
Wasn't he married to Gwyneth Paltrow for a while?
I know they were but I don't know if they're still together.
You know she actually has a great voice too.
Who Gwyneth Paltrow? I can't say I've ever heard her sing.
There was a movie called Duets that she came out in and she sang an old Smokey Robinson song called Let's Cruise
Oh I know his version but I've never heard her sing it.
It's acceptable. I won't go as far as to say it's great.
That's funny. Another actress who actually sings great is Zooey Deschanel
Did she come out with an album or something?
No she did the voice of one of the characters in the movie Trolls
Oh did she? How well does she sing?
She has an amazing voice. She sang a rendition of Hello by Lionel Richie.
Oh I'd love to hear that. Christopher Walken is a surprisingly good singing actor.
Right he played the voice of King Louie in the new version of The Jungle Book.
