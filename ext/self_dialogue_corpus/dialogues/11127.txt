Hey Sheryl have you seen my new Dooney & Bourke  hand bag?
New one?
The one I am holding.
Girl, that is cute. What is the name of it?
It's the Dooney & Bourke Patent Leather Trina Satchel.
That is such a pretty shade of yellow.
Isn't it? They call this shade dandelion.
What other colors does it come in?
Black, key lime and white.
Are all of the colors glossy like yours.
You know it.
I like the tassel on it. It makes the bag look fun.
I bought the dandelion color to wear with my spring outfits.
I'm not a big purse fan as I lean more towards cross body bags. They are easy and convenient.
Then this one would be a good one for you, too.   It is the perfect size, easy access -not too deep, not too wide.
I just love their bags but I hate their prices.
Dooney & Bourke can be and are usually pricey.
They are expensive.
But that bag is to die for. I may get me one.
I think every woman should  own at least one designer handbag in her lifetime.
