Do you like Lady Gaga?
I like her style.
She looks like she doesn't gove a crap what people think about her.
Probably not.
I like the song Monster.
I don't remember that one.  What about paparazzi?
The lyrics to that were good.  It has a good message.
So does Born Thos Way.  Inspiration in song.
What about Alejandro?
Those lyrics are pretty elementary.  Don't call my name Alejandro.  Gorl had Alejandro issues.
