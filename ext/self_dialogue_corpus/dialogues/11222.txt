Did you see the gowns at the Met Gala this year?
I did! Who was your favorite?
I thought that Rihanna looked amazing. She wore the designer being honored, you know.
She did make an impact, but her look was too much for me. I preferred the simpler looks, like Gisele.
But the designer is all about crazy looks, and Gisele was so boring!
Simple, but not boring! Her metallic gown was so beautiful.
No, I still think that it was boring. Who were some of your other favorites?
Dakota Johnson looked beautiful too.
I don't remember her look. What did it look like?
She wore a black dress with these shoulders that puffed up.
Oh, right, I remember that one now. That was a nice look too.
Who were your other favorites?
I thought Zendaya looked amazing--not as outrageous as some, but her dress made a bold statement.
I don't remember her. What did she wear?
She wore this orange gown with giant parrots on it.
That sounds interesting. Did you see Solange?
I did! She looked like she was wearing a giant sleeping bag, but it was fun.
You're right, it did look like a sleeping bag!
Some of the looks were really crazy this year.
Yes, some of them really were.
