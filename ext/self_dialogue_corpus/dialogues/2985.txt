Hey man, who do you think is the best receiver in the NFL?
Oh man that's tough there's some good ones.

Yeah I think I got it down to Bryant, AJ Green, Julio Jones, and Beckham.
Yeah I think those are all good, I take AJ Green out though.
Yeah I think those are all good, Id take AJ Green out though.
Why not AJ Green?
Why not AJ Green?
I think he's really good, I just don't think he offers some skills such as running after the catch, like the other guys do.

That's a good point.
And Julio Jones can be a stud, but sometimes I think his hands are a little bit suspect.
Yeah but he's such a force physically.
No doubt. Beckham might have the best hands of the bunch.
I'd  he has the most talented hands, but not the best hands.
Yeah I guess he does seem to drop a lot of easy balls.
Right, really I think that does leave those bryant as the best receiver.
Yeah I hate to say that because he's a cowboy though.
Yeah I hate acknowledging that any cowboy is good.
Their fans are just so annoying.
