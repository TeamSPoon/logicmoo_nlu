What is your favorite home run moment of all-time?
I think Mark McGwire hitting a monster homer off of Randy Johnson, when they were on Seattle and Oakland, respectively.
Don't say "respectively" in real life. That's for an academic paper. Also, the order is wrong. It should be "Oakland and Seattle, respectively," as you introduced McGwire first.
Don't be an idiot. What's your favorite?
Probably when Ken Griffey Jr. was essentially calling his shots in Boston during the home run derby.
I remember that! Wasn't he intentionally hitting home runs into the harder parts of the ball park?
Yeah, maybe he was doing that to be more fair. Or he's a prick and was showing off.
A bit of both, I'd say. He could have easily hit 50 over the pitifully-short right field walls.
I remember I was really proud of myself for calling the derby winner.
How so? Don't be pretentious, though.
My whole family said Sammy Sosa would win, and I called McGwire.
How'd you know?
Well, I remember seeing Sosa during the season and saw his home runs were more line drives, whereas Mark's were skyscrapers. Only one could tame the Big Monster.
That's what she said. Get it?
Seems like you planned that too far ahead. It wasn't very good, sorry. Least favorite home run moment?
Oh that's easy. Jeffrey Maier giving Jeter a homerun over the Orioles. They needed an idiotic, corrupt umpire to miss that call.
I remember that, it was awful. He clearly reached over.
Yours?
I'm a Phillies fan. Joe Carter's World Series walk-off was devastating.
Hahahaha, you're a Phillies fan!!!
