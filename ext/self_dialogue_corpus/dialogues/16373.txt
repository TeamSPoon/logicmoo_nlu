I'm trying to get a group together to play music. Know anyone?
Depends. What kind of music?
I guess pop punk kinda.
One of my roommates might be interested. Where do you practice?
I don't have a space yet, just trying toguage some interest first.
I have a pretty huge basement that we've rented out for shows before.
That's sweet! Would it be cool if I borrowed it to jam with your roommate if he's interested?
Yeah totally. I'll ask him if he wants to play. What musicians are you looking for?
Well I'm a drummer, so anything but a drummer!
Sweet, my roommate plays guitar.
Nice. Would you be able to put he in touch with him?
Yeah definitely. I'll give you his number.
Do you know if he currently has any bands or projects or anything going on?
Not that I'm aware of.
Cool. Maybe he knows some other folks too that might be interested.
How long have you been playing drums?
About 10 years. What about ypur roommate?
I think about the same, but I know he started playing music altogether when he was like 6.
That's sweet!
Yeah, I'll be sure to tell him we talked about this.
