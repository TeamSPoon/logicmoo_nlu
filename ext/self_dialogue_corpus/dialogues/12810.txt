I always liked the first film better than the second
Why is that?
All the actors in the first film were unknown and were really selling it
Who was your favorite character
Darth Vader, everyone loves Darth Vader
Why is that?
Because he was mysterious and bad and he didn;t make excuses for it
What was the worst thing he did?
Killing Obi Wan was the worst thing he ever did
Wow that is evil!
