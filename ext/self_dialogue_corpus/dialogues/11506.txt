What are you listening to?
A playlist I created of oldies music, right now it's the Beatles.
The Beatles? My mom loved them, I can't seem to get into their music though.
They were iconic. You don't even like "Hey Jude?"
No. What are some of their other hits?
My other favorite is "Here comes the sun."
Well, I guess that song is alright. I just don't understand why girls went so crazy over them.
My mom thought Paul McCartney was a total fox.
To each their own. It is sad about John Lennon, though.
Yes, especially because he had a young son. But he did leave quite a legacy.
