I just thought of something funny that could have happened in Episode VII.
I was doing work, but okay. Let's hear it.
Know how Kylo says "Grandfather...I'll finish what you started."
Yes, when looking at the helmet, right?
Yup. Imagine if he was from a different region.
How would that matter?
"Dad-dad. Papa. Gramps. I'll finish what you started."
So?
Same meaning, but hilarious
I get it, but the tone would be too affected. It would be distracting.
