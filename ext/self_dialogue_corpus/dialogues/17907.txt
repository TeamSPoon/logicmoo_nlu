Are you excited for the new Arcade Fire album?
I don't really know that much about them actually. What kind of music do they play?
They're an indie / alternative rock band. They've released some really great albums. I definitely recommend that you check them out.
Cool, I do like rock and roll music, so I'll have to give them a listen. What albums should I look for?
You could probably go in chronological order, but I'd say start with "Funeral." "Reflektor" was really incredible too.
Cool, thanks for the recommendation. As for me, I'm really stoked for the new Queens of the Stone Age album.
Me too, I heard the first single from the album on the radio, it sounds great.
Yeah, it's called "The Way You Used To Do" I believe. That song is awesome!
There's some other cool new music coming up I'm pretty excited for, like the the new album by The National.
I really like the lead singer's voice, really deep and emotive.
Yeah, that band really knows how to conjure up a dark mood, but in a good way.
Speaking of dark, have you heard the latest album by Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds?
I did actually, really heartrending stuff.
It sure was. No wonder after all he went through with the death of his son.
Yeah, I wondered whether he would return to making music at all, but I'm glad he did.
I saw him perform not long ago on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert actually. It was good to see him on stage again.
I imagine that must be very therapeutic for him in a way. I actually saw him perform at Madison Square Garden years ago in support of his album "Dig Lazarus Dig."
That must have been really cool. I hope to get a chance to catch his live act someday.
Yeah, it was a pretty wild night. You should see them if they're coming to a city near you.
I'll make a point to do that. I wonder if the vibe will be different at his live shows now.
