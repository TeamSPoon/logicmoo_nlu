You remember the Stone Roses?
Umm... no I don't think so.
They were huge in England in the early 90s.
They were never big in the States?
They had two minor hits.
What were they?
"She Bangs The Drum" and "Love Spreads."
I vaguely remember "Love Spreads."
It was ore well received in the US than the other song, ironically.
Ironically?
Yeah, it's from the second album, which was reviled in the UK.
Why, that bad?
It's not great but had the problem of coming after the first album.
What do you mean?
The first album was so perfect, nothing could have lived up to it.
People got their hopes up.
Yeah, but it didn't help that the second album wasn't great in general.
The first album was that good?
It's perfect.
I'll have to listen.
