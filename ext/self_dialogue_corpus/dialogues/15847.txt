What’s your favorite music genre?
That’s a hard one. I guess 80’pop music.
I know what you mean, 80’s pop is timeless.
Exactly. I love pet shop boys, Phil Collins, oingo boingo, pretty much all pop. What about you?
It changes all the time but right now I’m listening to a lot of classic rock.
Another great genre, anyone in particular?
AC/DC, I’m constantly listening to them lately.
What’s your favorite track?
Thunderstruck. That one gets me pumped, it’s great gym music.
I think you can’t go wrong with classic rock, I remember listening to guns and roses constantly when I was growing up.
Yes, I feel that thier music is so unique. I still listen to them now, I never get bored of listening to them, so many classic hits.
Agreed, like welcome to the jungle, paradise city, November rain, the list could just go on.
When I listen to any classic rock, it’s almost like there’s a song that takes me back in time.
I think that’s a lot to do with music from the 80’s and 90’s. It’s that part of your life where a lot of significant things happen.
That’s true, it’s almost like my life is a soundtrack.
I think that’s why I love 80’s music so much, it was all that my mother played when I was growing up.
Very true, I think the same when it comes to rock music. The same songs playing in my house everyday.
I grew up with the record, I remember when cd’s were launched. My first LP was Michael jackson bad.
Great album, timeless. I had that one too, I played it over and over again and the thriller album also!
Yes me to! I inherited that album from my mum. She loved Michael jackson and so did I.
