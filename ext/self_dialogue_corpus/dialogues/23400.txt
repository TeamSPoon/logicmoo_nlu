I watched this funny video the other day to raise autism awareness, and it had Adam Sandler and Bob Barker in it, so funny!
I'm not really a big fan of most of Adam Sandler's movies.
Which of his movies DO you like?
I like 50 first dates, and Click, I guess I like his more sentimental movies.
So you don't like Happy Gilmore, Waterboy, Billy Madison or Big Daddy?
I like the Waterboy ok, but not the others
what about Little Nicky or pixels?
Ok, yeah I like both of those. Little Nicky was the first Adam Sandler movie I ever saw, and Pixels is the most recent one I've seen. The kids loved Pixels.
I'm pretty picky with Rob Schneider movies, the two of them seem to have a similar brand of comedy and they're often in each other's movies.
"YOU CAN DOO EEEEET!"
HAHAHAHAHA! Yeah always with the cameos.
I liked his movies more as a 9-12 year old. I haven;t watched Rob's movies in a while...what even are some new ones?
Grownups franchise.
How many are there? I don't think I've even seen them.
There's a 1 and 2 right now, a 3rd is being made, I just saw a trailer the other day.
Does it look any good, or like a try too hard sequel?
Seems like hasbeens who need money.
Well that's sad.
speaking of has beens, I hear the cashmeoussidehowbowduh girl might be getting a reality show.
That is disgustingly disturbing.
