Have you seen all the Harry Potter movies?
Yes.  I have also read all the books.  They have so much going on in them.
Yes.  There are a lot of side stories.  Which was your favorite book?
I have to admit that I really liked the first one the best.  I believe it's called Chamber of Secrets.
That was a good one.  I really like the part where they were playing chess with those big chess pieces.
I think I liked the part best when Hagrid came and got Harry for the first time.
His aunt and uncle were a little surprised, weren't they?
I always think there is something special about the first in a series of movies.  They seem more original.
I have to say that the visual effects in the movie got even better as the movies went along.
I agree.  I do hate that the series is over.  I enjoyed watching them so much.
