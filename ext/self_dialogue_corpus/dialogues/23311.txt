What is your favorite Stephen King book made into a movie?
I don't know. There were a few good ones.
There were. I just watched the old IT last night.
They redid that one didn't they?
Yes, it's not in theatres until September.
Are you going to go see it?
I don't know. The first is so creepy.
I know. Pennywise the clown just creeps me out.
The preview for the new movie looks good.
I saw it too. Looks like it starts out the same way as the old movie.
Yes, with the little boy losing his boat in the sewer.
Did you see the new clown?
Yes, even more creepier.
I don't like clowns.
Me either. Probably because of the movie IT.
Yes, I think that has ruined a lot of kids.
Stephen King movies are very good.
I liked the movie Misery too.
Yes, Kathy Bates played a great role.
She did and she was in Dolores Claiborne too.
