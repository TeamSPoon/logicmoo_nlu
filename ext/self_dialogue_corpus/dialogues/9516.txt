Man, i'm so sick of all of these poppy-rap songs!
Yeah man, tell me about it.
Why can't radio stations go back to the good old days where rap gods dominated the airwaves?
Personally, I think it's time the rap game go back to what made it great.
Yeah, they need to ditch all the excess noise and get back to their roots.
That's harder than it sounds, especially with today's artists.
What do you mean by that?
Without their autotune, they would all sound like amatures with no flow.
There's gotta be at least one artist with enough skill to ditch all the autotune.
We'll just have to wait and see, because as it looks now, the future of rap seems bleak.
