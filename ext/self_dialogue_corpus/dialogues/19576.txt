Hi there, what kind of music have you been listening to lately?
Hi, and I've been listening to a lot of instrumental music.
Without any words?
Well without any singing really or singers.
Is that mainly like classical music?
No not quite. Some stuff sounds pretty classical though.
What's your favorite instrumental song?
I'm not sure, but I like a lot of electronic instrumental stuff.
Like techno?
Sure some techno instrumentals are good, like Daft Punk.
They're pretty popular I've heard.
Definitely, especially now since they've been doing a lot of songs with guest artists.
What other bands have good instrumental stuff?
C418 is one of my favorites, they're really really good.
They do Minecraft music right?
Yeah they did the music for Minecraft, that's what they're most famous for.
What else have they done?
Music that's pretty similar, lots of classical kinds of piano pieces and good melodies.
I liked what's in Minecraft so I'll probably like the other stuff that they've done.
I think you would, give the Beta album a good listen through. It's very long though.
