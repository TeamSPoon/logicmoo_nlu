How did you feel when at the end of the one movie happened
What when they almost lost
Yeah i was expecting them to lose
Same but then griffindor got the extra points
Then they clutched the win and saved the day
Yeah i was on the edge of my set
Dumbledore is such a nice guy
I know right
He is like the father harry never had
Pretty much what he is set up to be
