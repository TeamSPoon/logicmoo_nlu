Did you see Captain America?
Yes, that was my favorite MCU movie.
It was pretty good.  Tommy Lee Jones was pretty good in that.
So was Chris Evans.  He's great as Cap.
I know.  Did you know in the beginning that was him playing that part?
No way?!  That is amazing.  I thought it was a different actor.
Yeah a lot of people did.  But they just altered his image.
That's amazing.
It was.  And the plot was one of the better ones too.
The World War 2 era fighting was cool.
That's what Cap was made for.
And lets not forget the Red Skull.
Hugo Weaving was awesome as the Red Skull.
I hope they bring him back somehow in a future movie.
I mean why not?  Cap survived.
And the Red Skull is just like him only evil.
And ugly.
Yes, very ugly.
Still, that movie was just solid all around.
I agree, MCU is doing it right.
