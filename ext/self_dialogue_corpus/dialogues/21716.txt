Who do you think is a better actor, Colin Farrell or Jack Nicholson?
Thats a hard one, I'd have to say Colin Farrell.
Why?
I just like more of his movies
Thats fair, but which do you think has more talent?
Hmm, maybe Jack
Yea, I agree.
I do like Phonebooth a lot though
Me too! It was fun
Almost no one liked it though
Yea, I thought the dyamic between him and keifer sutherland was great
I love keifer, I wish he was in more movies
He is great in 24
Yea, the 24 movie was amazing.
I wish Colin Farell would do some more dramas.
Yea, he has not been in many movies recently
I know, a lot of these actors are getting older.
Where has Jessica Alba gone?
I dont know, she has not been in many movies either
I guess I will start looking at younger actors to admire now.
