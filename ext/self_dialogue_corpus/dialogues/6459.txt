Finding Nemo was a great Disney movie, don’t you think?
Yes, all of the tropical fish were so vibrant, and colourful.
It didn’t have a lot of singing in it like many Disney movies.
I still enjoyed it though; I thought the characters were charming.
Which was your favourite character?
I liked Dory best, the forgetful fish.
I agree, I liked Dory best as well, she was very funny.
I though the part with the sharks was a bit scary.
Yes, but I felt sorry for them as well, because they were trying so hard to be vegetarians.
I thought Bruce the shark was very funny.
