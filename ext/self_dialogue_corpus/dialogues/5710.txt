What are your thoughts on The Hunchback of Notre Dame?
I enjoyed the film. I thought it was very dark for children.
It is a dark story. I was surprised to learn of the actors involved.
I never looked into it deeply. Who was it?
Well hugo was voiced by jason alexander.
George from Seinfeld?
The very same. I like him a lot, I was just shocked to know it was him.
He has a distinct voice. I never watched it more than once to realize who it was. who else?
Well Demi moore is also involved. She was Esmerelda.
They are both very seductive characters/people. I think that was a good casting choice. Demi has a sultry voice.
