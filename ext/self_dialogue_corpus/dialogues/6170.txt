If you could become a part of a Disney movie, which would you pick?
All of them!
Okay, okay. But if you had to narrow it down?
Let's see...probably Pirates of the Caribbean.
Pirates, totally!
Exactly! Who wouldn't want to be an awesome pirate?
Would you want to sail with Jack Sparrow?
Oh yeah. That would be so entertaining!
Have you seen the new Pirates movie yet?
Nope, but have plans to see it this weekend.
