Who is your favorite rapper of this generation?
I would have to say that Lil Wayne is my favorite rapper these days.
Really, I just can't seem to get into any of his songs.
Yeah man! I just really enjoy the comentary of his songs.
I mean, to me, the lyrics just seem vulgar and disgusting.
I mean, if you're listening to the wrong songs, I could see your argument.
Just look at "Lollipop", it has no message at all other than pure vulgarity.
He may not have a solid message like rappers from the past, but I can still appreciate his music.
I mean, to each his own, I just can't see past how empty his music sounds.
Perhaps it's more a general fault of rap today, rather than purely Lil Wayne, that skews your perception of his music as being empty.
