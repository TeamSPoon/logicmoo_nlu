I think the best action movie of all time is Die Hard.
You see, I'd agree with you if they didn't just put out Mad Max Fury Road.
Wait you're going to put Mad Max Fury Road over Die Hard?
Nothing against Die Hard, Bruce Willis is the man and it's his best film but come on, George Miller.
I guess I'm just not seeing what makes Mad Max Fury Road so good.
Did you watch it?
Yes I've watched it twice.
Then if you still can't see what makes it so good then I'm not sure what to say.
It's just Max barely said a word.
And that's fine because it's an action movie, and when it comes to practical effects and directing it's the greatest of all time.
I'll have to give it another watch but in my mind nothing competes with Bruce Willis.
You're not going to get much push back from me because in a world where Mad Max doesn't exist I would pick Die Hard.
That is comforting to hear and in a world where Die Hard doesn't exist I would pick Mad Max.
Very well, now can we talk about Mad Max being better than Die Hard?
But Die Hard exists so no, no we cannot.
Alright you got me.
I will agree though that what George Miller accomplished with Fury Road was magical.
Seeing in theaters is an experience that cannot be replicated.
Do you think we'll see a sequel?
He says it's coming, who knows when though, it's an exhausting movie to make.
