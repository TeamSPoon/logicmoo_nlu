Have you heard of Korean Hip Hop?
I thought it was a joke at first, but I actually like it.
I know. Its not like the rap or hip hop here in the US, it has more singing in it and shows vocal range.
True. Its like the rappers are more like Idols than just rappers.
Exactly. Sometimes you can't even tell if a group is a hip hop group or a idol group.
Big Bang is a good band that shows that.
Yep. G Dragon is really good at that. He sings and can rap.
I know. I love his music, Crooked is probably one of my favorite songs.
Did you hear he is going on tour this year?
I did. I want to see him live.
