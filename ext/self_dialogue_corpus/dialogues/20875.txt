Hi! Have you seen the movie Sausage Party?
I did, and I really regret it.
I was about to say! I was an animation movies fanatic, but that movie is really disappointing.
I agree. Aside of the over-excessively lewd humor and such, the plot itself is not really interesting.
I agree. I am glad that I did not watch it in the theater.
Me too! I watched it on netflix.
There are so much controversies surrounding that movie too!
Ooohh please do tell!
For example, the animators are forced to work overtime with no overtime pays!
Really? How awful! Where did you learn about this?
Some websites. Also while it is rated adult in the US, it was not so in Sweden.
What do you mean?
Well, I forget the ratings definition. But basically kids from 7 - 11 years old can watch it wit adult supervision. Kids above 11 years old can watch it themselves!
Wow! I wonder how the parents thought after learning about the movie!
Ha ha! Probably they have the same reactions like what we had when watching the movie.
That is pretty interesting. I also learned that Edward Norton was one of the voice actor.
Interesting! Which character?
The bagel! Remember? He is one of the sidekick!
Ah I remember that character! He sounded like Woody Allen!
Ha ha! Yes! It was Norton's idea actually to have the character to sound like Woody Allen!
