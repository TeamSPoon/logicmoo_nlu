Hey man, do you ever listen to Dio?
What is a Dio?
Dio is not a what!  I am talking about Ronnie James Dio.
I never heard of him.
Seriously?  He was the lead singer in Black Sabbath for a time.
Black Sabbath?  Is that Ozzy Osbourne's group?
Yes, but Ozzy left the group back in the 80's for a time.  Dio took over the singing for two albums.
Ok, I could give those a try as I like heavy metal.
Awesome!  Go out and buy "Heaven and Hell" and "Mob Rules".
I will do that.  Is that the only two albums I should buy?
That's just a start.  Dio was in a number of groups.
What groups was Dio in?
Well there is Elf, Rainbow, Black Sabbath, Dio and Heaven & Hell.
That is a lot of groups.  Are they all good?
Well I don't really care for Elf.  They did not really have any popular songs.
Ok, I will not check into Elf.  What about the others?
Rainbow had a few songs that really rocked.  Not sure if you really want to buy the albums.
Well I will keep that in mind.
If you want to hear Dio at his best just stick with his Black Sabbath years, any Dio album and the one studio album from Heaven & Hell.
Thanks for the info man.  I will do that!
