What do you thin of Ed Sheeran?
I think he's great.
My favorite is Galway Girl.
That ones good, but I like his version of Wayfaring Stranger that he has on YouTube.
I don't think I've seen that yet.
You have to check it out, he does it with just a microphone and a repeater.
Whoa really, that sounds awesome.
It is, it shows how good he actually is.
I just bought Shape of you off of iTunes.
Well hit play and turn it up.
