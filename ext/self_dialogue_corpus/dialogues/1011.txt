Have you ever been to any NFL games?
Only a few times and it was the Cowboys.
How is their stadium?
It is awesome.  Jerry Jones really put a lot of unique things inside.
I think the Falcons have a new stadium this year that looks really cool.
All these billionaire owners are trying to one up another with stadiums.
Don't forget the stadium in Los Angels for the Rams and Chargers.
Football in Los Angeles seems weird. Did you see any of those Rams games last year?
I did see some video of a few it was like no one was there.
There is too much to do in L.A.  I don't think the people are all in on football.
It's a shame that the Rams move from St. Louis.
It all came down to a stadium issue there.
It's hard for the small market teams in the NFL to compete financially.
Yes and the owners just want cities to pay for new stadiums because of the revenue the teams can generate for cities.
The NFL is big business for sure.  They get my money for merchandise and watching the games.
The Super Bowl is a must watch event now.
That last Super Bowl was one for the ages!
I agree, Tom Brady and the Patriots never quit.
These professionals really love the game and it showed through in the last Super Bowl when they could've given up.
Well Belichek alwasy has a plan and he made one for that comeback.
