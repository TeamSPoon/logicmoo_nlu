I hope they make more Fast and Furious movies.
I'm not sure if they can.
Why not?
They're already done a lot and Paul Walker won't be in them
That is true.
Paul Walker makes the franchise.
Maybe they can replace him?
No way
Each movie is really good though.
Yes. The only one I did not like was the second one.
