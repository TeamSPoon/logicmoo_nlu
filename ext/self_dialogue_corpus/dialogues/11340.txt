Do you listen to the Beatles?
Sometimes I do.
My mom found an old box of records in the basement. There were a few Beatles albums in there.
Do you have a record player?
My mom found one in the basement. It still works.
What albums did you find?
We found Revolver, A Hard Day's Night and Let It Be.
I heard that there's a Beatles album that's worth thousands of dollars.
It's called Yesterday and Today. It wasn't in the box.
I wonder why it's worth so much.
