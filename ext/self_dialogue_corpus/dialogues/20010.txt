Turn that back. That sounded like the Thompson Twins "Hold Me Now".
You only heard a second of the song, how did you know?
That was one of favorite songs when I was growing up.
I like the bass in the song.
No matter how old I get, or how old this song gets, I will always love it.
I love this song too. It is simple yet creative.
It brings back a ton of absolutely great memories and a few bad ones too!
That's nostalgia for you.
I remember how much I miss the music of the '80s, a timeless era, a timeless classic!
I think we are hopelessly stuck in 80's.
If I had to be stuck in a decade, I'd rather be in the 80's.
I think  plenty of people in the world are "hopelessly" stuck in the 80's.
We aren't the only ones?
Not by a long shot.
Do you know where they got their band name from?
I always wondered that because I never saw any twins in their videos.
The band got the name from the two detectives in  the adventures of tin tin comic strip.ï»¿
Cool factoid! I like this band, and never knew that!
This song has two of the best lines ever, which I think everyone can relate to. "I'll ask your forgiveness but I just don't know what I'm asking it for"
"You ask if I love you but what do I say? You know that I do and this is just one of those games that we play".
