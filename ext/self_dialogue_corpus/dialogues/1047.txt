What do you think of the Giants chances this year?
Hard to say.  They've got a tough road in front of them.
But they've got such a killer receiving group.
No doubt.  Gonna be hard to try and guard them.
ODB is the best WR in the game.
Top 5 for sure, but hard to say he's the best.
But looks who's backing him up.  There's enough CB's on a team to stop their WR onslaught.
Signing Brandon Marshall will be interesting.
Right, and they've got Shepard who was awesome last year.
I think they lost Victor Cruz, right?
Yeah, he signed elsewhere, but he's done anyway.
What happened to him?
Injuries.  He was robbed of his speed when he blew out his knees.
Tough break for him.
Eli Manning is getting old which won't help.
I think he's 35 or so at this point.
Yeah, and he's slowing down quite a bit.
I bet the defense will help relieve some pressure.
Probably so.  They'll challenge for a wild card spot.
Even the division.  I expect Dallas to fall a bit.
