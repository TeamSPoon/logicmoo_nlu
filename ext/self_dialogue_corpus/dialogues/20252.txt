Have you seen the new Wonder Woman movie?
No I haven't.
I saw it with Cheri last week.
How was it?
It was awesome!  Not like the comic books.
How so?
She was an amazon and was fighting in world war 1
Really?  That's interesting.
Yeah it was really cool.  She fought to kill some god that she thought was one of the German leaders.
That is different!
Yeah but then it turned out the real bad god was actually British!
Laugh - that's funny!
Yeah but I want to go live on the island with all of the Amazons.
I have heard that is an awesome place.
Its a beautiful sunny tropical island.
And it has no men!
Exactly!  Its much more peaceful that way without men to start wars!
For sure.  Women are way smarter!
Laugh!  Yes for sure.  We can use our brains!
Yes.  There are better uses for our money than starting wars.
