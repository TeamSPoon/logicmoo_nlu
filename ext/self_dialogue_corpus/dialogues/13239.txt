I'm so sad about Carrie Fisher dying. She made the first Star Wars movies so special.
She really did. Princess Leia was one of the best parts of the original trilogy.
I feel like she was really independent in a way we don't get to see very often with women in action movies.
Yeah! And her storyline is so compelling.
She loses her home in the process of seeking justice.
Right. And she totally gets revenge for it too.
Luke's story is also a revenge story, sort of.
Yeah, there's a lot of revenge going on.
Everyone except Han. He's just in it for the money.
Only at first!
