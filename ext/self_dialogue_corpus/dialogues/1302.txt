Hey, I see the Chiefs are coming out to Foxborough for opening day. Catch a flight and come out out.
Wow, I thought the Patriots would play the Falcon's opening day. That would be great.
Yes, I've been out here for 3 years, XX moved us out for a new job and I love the town.
Really, I haven't talked to you in 5 years I didn't know. I'd love to come out there.
Yes, 2 years ago with the Chiefs played the Patriots in the Playoffs, I had ticket but got sent to London the week of the game so my wife went with a friend.
What are the odds, that would suck.
Yes it did, oddly; it was a noon game so I was haunting the streets of Soho looking for a pub that was televising the game. Not what I envisioned with I bought the tickets.
Wow, you get to travel to England for work, amazing. So what weekend is that game?
They're playin Thursday, September 7 at Gillette Stadium. Opening day.
Definetly, I'll look into airfarer. I hear it's a pretty good tailgate.
I haven't been to a game, but Stacey said she was the only Chiefs fan in the endzone sears I got surronded by a lot of blue, red and silver.
How much are the tickets?
I don't know, I'm sure I can get a pair on Stubhub for $300 or $400, it being there not the quality of tickets.
Are the Chiefs anygood this year?
I don' t really know, they fired the GM, John Dorsey; relased their best receiver Jeremy Maclin so who knows.
Well, I've never been to a Patriots game so I'll look into tickets tomorrow.
Great, let me know, I think you can get airfare from KC to Logan Airport for around $300 this far in advanced. Look into Providence, RI too because it cheaper, less crowded and closer to Foxborough and our house.
Definetly,  I look them up tomorrow and get back to you.
Perfect, we haven't caught up in a long time and what a weekend to do it!
Your right, we should do thas more often.
