Do you ever listen to Rap music?
I'm not a huge fan unless it is "classic 90's rap" as I call it.
What do you mean?
I mean I like artists like Snoop Dog, Biggie Smalls, Tupac.
Tupac is amazing!
Yes it's a shame his life ended when it did. Just imagine what he could have accomplished.
One of my faves was "California Love".
Yes I loved that one! Especially because I used to live there.
It was always a good hit.
You know who else was good but you didn't hear a lot about?
Who is that?
Coolio. I loved his song "Gangster's Paradise."
Oh my goodness that is an old one!
You're right it is but I loved it. Still do.
Rap music these days is nothing like it used to be.
No it really isn't.
Remember when P Diddy used to be Puff Daddy?
Yes I do, not sure why he changed his name.
I'm not sure either. Remember that one song he did with Mariah Carey?
Yes it was "One Fine Day" I think!
