Do you think the quarterback option is an outdated move in today's NFL?
Yeah, I think the defenses in the league have learned how to defend against.
I kind of disagree. I think it still have its merits.
How so?
I think that quarterbacks with good pocket presence will still be able to use the move to stall defenses.
So only good quarterbacks can use it?
Yeah, I think quarterbacks who can stay in the pocket longer can benefit from it.
What about running quarterbacks?
I don't think they'll be able to manage it. Like you said, defenses are just too fast these days.
I agree. I think quarterbacks who use it to run themselves are going to get buried.
But like I said, good passing quarterbacks can use it to stall defenses.
Which quarterbacks do you think can use it?
Aaron Rodgers, Tom Brady, etc. those kinds of quarterbacks.
It's so odd how that move became so outdated.
Yeah, I think defenses were just so new to it that they didn't know how to respond.
That's why the NFL is the top of the class when it comes to studying film.
I hope more elite quarterbacks use it though. It's entertaining.
I agree.
I definitely think that a good offensive line helps as well.
Definitely.
