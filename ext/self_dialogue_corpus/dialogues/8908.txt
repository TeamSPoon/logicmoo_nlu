would you say rock music is dead nowadays?
well of course not, there are plenty of rock bands that still draw huge crowds
But doesn't there seem to be a significant lack of new rock bands these days?
I suppose, yeah. Most of the big touring acts nowadays have been touring for decades.
Why do you think that is?
I think there's a total genre shift happening in general right now - towards rap and edm.
hmm, why would rap and edm invalidate popular rock music the way it seems to?
maybe because of the technology - digital instrumentation is so sophisticated now that real instrumentation is pretty rare these days
I've noticed the distinct digital sound now - maybe it's part of a changing social philosophy?
perhaps, we're definitely looking at a different aesthetic now than we were 30 years ago.
