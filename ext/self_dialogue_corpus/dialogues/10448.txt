Hey man, how are things?
I can't complain; how are you?
No complaints here either. I've been super busy recently, but mostly with cool stuff.
Yeah? Like what?
My brother and I went to see the band Mutoid Man play the other night; it was really good.
Mutoid Man? Never heard of them.
I think you'd dig them. Really heavy riff-based rock.
Kind of like Mastodon?
Eh, not really, maybe like a heavier Queens of the Stone Age.
Oh man, sounds right up my alley. So the show was good?
Yeah, it was super loud and my ears are still ringing. The show was two nights ago.
I remember when we saw Explosions in the Sky I swear my ears rang for a week.
Yeah man, those guys are super loud.
So good though. Did you know that they did the Friday Night Lights soundtrack?
No, I didn't. That's awesome.
Yeah, they've actually done a number of soundtracks besides that one.
Like what?
The Lone Survivor soundtrack.
Really? That was a pretty decent movie.
Yeah, I liked it too.
