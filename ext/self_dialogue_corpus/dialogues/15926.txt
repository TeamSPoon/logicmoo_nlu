I need to find some good music to listen to!
Do you like music that is popular today?
Not really, I am a fan of older music to be honest.
That is cool, who do you like?
I used to listen to the Judds all the time!
My mom used to have one of their CD's.
I love that song Why Not Me that they sung.
I heard that one before, it is really good.
What other ones of theirs have you heard?
Did they sing one about one of their grandparents?
I think you are talking about their song called Grandpa. I love that one as well.
See, I know some older music myself!
Have you ever heard Mama, He's Crazy?
I do not think I have heard that one before.
You should listen to it some time!
I will, what other old country do you enjoy?
I love Conway Twitty as well.
I do not know of any of his songs.
I love the song Lay You Down that he sang.
Maybe I will have to start listening to some of this old music!
