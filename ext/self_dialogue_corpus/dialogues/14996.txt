What is your favorite comedy film?
My favorite has always been Billy Madison.
What a great movie with so many good one-liners!
I agree; it's just so quotable!
What about Billy Madison?
I love that one too, though I get annoyed by how immature Adam Sandler's character is in the film.
Yeah, that's true, but Chris Farley's cameo is amazing.
Oh, I know! He's amazing.
I just wish Adam Sandler would make good comedies again.
Agreed, or quit trying to make comedies altogether.
