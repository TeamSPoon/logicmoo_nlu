So what did you think about Frozen?
I was really surprised that Anna was more a main character than Elsa.
Yeah that was odd but Oloaf was my favorite.
Definatly. He was so funny. Some things he said when he was dreaming about summer.
Or when kristoff said "I'm going to tell him"
Yeah that was funny too.
I still don't understand how all of a sudden she could contol her power at the end.
Yeah that was odd. And every one in the kingdom had turned on her and then poof everything is back to normal.
Yeah oh well I still think it was a good movie.
Meh. There was too much singing and all the songs get stuck in my head.
