How do you think The Last Jedi will be?
Not sure but I hope it doesnt focus around Leia's death
Do we know she will die?
Well she did in real life so I imagine thats what they do
They could CGI her for as long as they need.
They could also have her die off screen.
I hope Kylo Ren has a bigger role.
He had a huge role what are you talking about?
Some times evil needs to triumph good
This is Disney though
