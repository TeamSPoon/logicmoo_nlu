Hey do you like Disney movies?
Sure, why?
Which one is your favorite?
Probably the Lion King.  What about you?
Definitely Pocohantas.  I loved the music.
Disney always has the best soundtracks.  I loved the soundtrack from Aladdin too.
Yeah, that was great.  A Whole New World is an awesome song.
They always have really talented singers on their cast.
Yeah, they always make great choices in voice actors.   I can't wait for the next Disney movie to come out.
Me too, they never disappoint.
