You know there is not one song on the American top 40 that I would buy right now or even listen to again.
Same.
It's horrible.
This is bad.
So how do you tactfully
Just go in the room and shut it off. Ban all quote music of that nature. Confiscate it from your son.
Play something he would actually want to hear that betters the atmosphere.
He would now listen to the other at another house?
No.
Is there someone we can report to?
Your local Congressman. The FCC?
That is a good question.
"If you're unhappy with the quality of the music, words, and lyrics that fill our mainstream airways.....
Right.
What if we just start playing some classical
Or something sweet and funny
It would change things. Sweet would change things. Funny not so sure.
Fantastical.
Please.
There are kids right now riding in cars
