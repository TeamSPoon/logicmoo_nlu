Are you a fan of zombie movies?
Yes, I absolutely love them.
Me too!  I even like the really cheesy ones.
Yes, they have a pack of movies at Walmart for like $5 and it has a few bad zombie movies on it.
I hope The Walking Dead has a movie at some point.
I think that seems like a logical way to go.
Maybe have the series end and then have a movie afterwards.
Yeah, I don't really like prequels but I feel like The Walking Dead needs one.
It's hard to keep up with indeed.
Still, nothing beats Night of the Living Dead.
