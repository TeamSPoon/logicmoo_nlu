What is going on with the Steelers?
Big news is Martavis Bryant looks to have turned himself around and will be able to compete this year.
That is big news.  He could really open things up for Ben and the rest of the offense.
I agree, with AB, Leveon and Martavis the offense is primed to perform.
It seems like we've been saying that for a while now.
I know.  The problem is they haven't all been healthy and ready to play at the same time.
Staying healthy is easily the most important aspect of the game.
Do you think teams will work the players less during training camp so as to preserve their bodies?
Honestly, it is a very fine line. If you don't prepare you can easily get manhandled during the season.  Over prepare, and you risk wearing down your body.
I think the league needs to be harsher with guys that are obviously trying to hurt other players.
You mean guys like Vontaze Burfict?
Exactly. I mean I understand it's football, and things happen, but when you witness it over and over and don't address it in the proper way?  I think it is bad for the league.
Especially when players get suspended for a year for smoking marijuana.
Really does not seem to make sense. You treat the guy who could benefit from coddling harshly and then the guy that is flagrantly trying to take out superstars, you coddle.
Seems weird that their HR is so outdated and behind the times.
You would think they would be super progressive.
If not progressive, a little more concerned about the welfare of their superstars.
Sometimes I think they forget the value that these guys bring to the game.
That is for sure. Who would go see the Patriots without Tom Brady, and look how the league treated him.
They need to get their Human Resources act together.
