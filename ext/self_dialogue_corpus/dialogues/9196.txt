So are you a big fan of Jimi Hendrix?
Yeah, I have all his studio albums. Not the live stuff, though.
There are a lot of bootlegs and lost recordings of live shows that have come out.
Yeah, it's almost like the Grateful Dead, huh? Hippies love collecting live shows.
Hendrix in the studio was pretty fascinating, though.
I know. If you listen to "Third Stone from the Sun" there's a lot of experimental stuff going on.
Backwards tapes, stereo panning, probably an attempt to reproduce what it sounded like to be on drugs.
You mean like auditory hallucinations? Maybe.
But there are a lot of artists who created a bunch of self-indulgent noise and put it on tape, like the Red Krayola.
True! Hendrix was gifted as a pop songwriter, and that made all the difference.
