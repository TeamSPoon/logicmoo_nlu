Hey little girl!
Hi Dad!
I was cleaning out the attic and came across this box of old Disney storybooks.
Oh, awesome!
But take a look at this one, 101 Dalmations.
Yeah.
Look at this page. Read it and tell me what you think.
That doesn't seem right. It did happen that way in the movie!
That's right! They changed the story details in the book!
Political correctness, I guess.
