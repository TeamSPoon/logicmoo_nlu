Why do you think they put 2 villains in Spiderman 3?
That made it interesting
It made spiderman look weak
It was important to the story
Spiderman should have seen that coming
It was god that he was there to save Mary Jane
That was a good move by the villains to capture her
Why do you think Sandman agreed to team up against Spiderman
Maybe he thought Spiderman would try to kill him
The sandman was basically invincible
