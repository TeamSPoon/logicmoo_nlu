Did you hate the Phantom Menace?
Yes it was a wasted opportunity and sellout of original fans.
Exactly. Too much for kiddies with Jar Jar and idiotic dialogue.
George Lucas was just making more money like with the reissues.
It was odd Jar Jar seemed like a racist caricature too.
Also Watto was.
Could have been a great movie. Darth Maul was a great character.
Yea Lucas is washed up as a director.
Yup and these new ones Rogue and Awakens are great with his hands off.
Lucas is done creatively but his works can be mined for more material.
