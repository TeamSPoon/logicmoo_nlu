Who wins Rookie of the Year?
A Sixer
No kidding? Which one?
I think Saric should
Because he stayed healthy?
Yeah the best ability is availability.
I believe that but Embiid was all worldly.
He was and he changed the way games looked.
So you wont give him the award?
He did not do it for long enough in my opinion
I guess I can see that viewpoint
Can Embiid stay healhy?
I would say no because of his height.
Shaq didnt have the problems hes having.
Of course not but thats rare.
So every year something else will happen.
I think so, yeah.
Is he teetering on Oden status?
Hes shown hes better than Oden.
I second that for sure.
