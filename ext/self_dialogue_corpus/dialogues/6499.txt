Pixar movies are my favorite.
Me too! Did you know that Pixar is a subsidiary of Disney?
Yeah, I think I heard that before. What does that mean?
It means they're under the umbrella of Disney. All of their movies come out under the Disney imprint.
Are you saying that some Disney movies are Pixar, but that every Pixar movie is Disney?
Exactly.
That makes sense.  I think Finding Dory is my favorite.
Oh, that's a great one. I actually prefer Finding Nemo.
I have to say, it's honestly a tough choice between the two. I might have a recency bias.
Yeah, it's a tough choice. Maybe I have a nostalgia bias.
