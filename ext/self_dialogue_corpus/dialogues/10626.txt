I just don't know what to think about the Fast and The Furious films now?
I think I know what you mean, but you need to elaborate some more.
Well, look at the first film.  It was a decent action film revolving around racing and fast cars.
It also revolved around "family" as "Dom" always likes to say.
Right.  The stunts were great, but for the most part everything was believable.
Which is the complete opposite of what they are doing now.
Exactly!  In the Fast Five film, there was a scene where they were using their cars to drag a sealed bank vault down a busy street!
In the Fate of The Furious, the Rock's character manhandled a torpedo.  I love it.
Maybe it is because I am getting old, but I like my action scenes to be more realistic.
I want to see how much farther the movies will push the envelope.  Will space be the final frontier for the movies?
