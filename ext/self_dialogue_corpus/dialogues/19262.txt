What are you doing Labor Day weekend?
Nothing in patticular, why?
Do you like local music?
I'm not really familiar with it to be honest.
Well there's a local music festival going on, and it's usually pretty fun!
Sounds cool, but I am kinda on a strict budget right now.
Don't worry! It's free.
I'm definitely down then! Do people usually know all the musicians there?
No, definitely not. They're all small bands, but some really talented artists!
What kind of music is it mostly?
I'd say it's kind of a mesh of a lot of genres.
Is it danceable?
Totally.
Then you don't need to convince me any further!
Yay! There's also some good food trucks there.
Where does it take place?
It's just in the corner park, you don't need tickets or anything.
Cool.
Wanna meet there Saturday before Labor Day at 1?
I will! And bring my dancing shoes!
