Have you ever watched the Kill Bill movies series?
Yes I did.
What did you think?
They were great.
Yea, Quentin Tarantino makes some messed up movies.
Yea, but they are good.
Uma Therman was great in the films.
I liked her character. She had ever right to do what she did.
I agree.
There were a lot of good actors in those.
Yea I like Michael Madsen.
He is a good actor.
Daryl Hanah's character was no good. She was terrible to her.
Yes she was, I'm glad she got bit by a snake.
She deserved it.
How many volumes were there?
Uma Thurman won a couple awards for her role.
I didn't know that.
Sorry, there were only two movies.
I forgot I even asked you that.
