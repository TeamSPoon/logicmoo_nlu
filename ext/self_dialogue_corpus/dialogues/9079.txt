Which era is your favorite for rock music?
I love rock music from the 90's! That era epitomized rock music.
I actually agree with you. I really resonate with certain rock groups from the 90's.
Which ones are your favorites?
My two favorite groups are the Stone Temple Pilots and Depeche Mode.
Great choices! I think both of those groups produced some great rock music.
I jammed out to quite a few of their songs.
I did too. "Big Bang Baby" by the Stone Temple Pilots was my jam.
That is too funny. I can just imagine you jamming around to that song in your room on full blast.
If you think that is funny you should have seen my hair styles that I had during that time!
