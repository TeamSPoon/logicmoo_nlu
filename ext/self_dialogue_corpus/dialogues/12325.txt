So which Star Wars movie is your favorite?
Well, that is a complex question. Do you mean of the old trilogy, the newer movies, or out of all of them?
Out of all of them.
I guess I would still have to go with A New Hope.
I like the older ones better anyways.
Yeah, they will always be Star Wars to me.
Anytime Jar-Jar Binks is in a scene of the newer ones I about have to leave the room.
Oh I know, I cannot stand to here that thing talk.
Why in the world did they add him as a character?
I can see why his part was important, but why did they make him so annoying?
