Have you seen that old Disney movie Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs?
Yes, of course!  I used to love that movie when I was growing up!
Me too!  I wish Disney would make a newer version.
That would be really cool, I would be first in line to the theatre to watch it.
How many of the seven dwarfs can you name? I think I know all of them.
I'm not sure, I know probably around 5 off the top of my head.
Did you know it first came out in 1937?
No I didn't.  For such an old film it is really good!
I agree, I didn't realise at first how old it was!
Neither, you've made me appreciate it even more now!
