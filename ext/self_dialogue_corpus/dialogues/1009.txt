Who is your favorite football player?
Currently or ever?
At any time.
Well, for many years when i was asked that it was Martine Grammatica.
He was a kicker?
Yes, for the bucs like 15 or so years ago.
What did you like about him?
Well, he was like 5 foot 3 and use to plant that field goal every time.
Seriously?
Yes, they use to call him "Automatica"
No way. That was cool.
Yeah, his family was all kickers like in football and soccer.
Right on.
Yeah, it was odd when he left football.
How so?
Well, he just had a perfect season and he lissed like 2 field goals halfway thru the season and they just swapped him out.
That's very strange.
I agree. i never looked into it but it always bothered me.
No doubt.
Someday i'll read up on it.
