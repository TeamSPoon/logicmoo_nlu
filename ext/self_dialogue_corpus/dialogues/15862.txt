What do you think of Tupac Shakur's music?
Oh wow, what a hard question to answer.  He's definitely one of my favorite artists of all time.
Why is it hard to answer then?
Well, I love his music.  I have so much to say about it.
I love his music too.  Plus there's so much intrigue surrounding him and his biography.
Yeah, there really is.  Some people think he's still alive.
I don't, but I think his music is great.  I think he wrote some of it in prison.
Yeah, he did.  That's what I heard too.
And it's weird to me that he kept producing music after he was dead.
I think that was stuff he already wrote that someone else produced and released.
Oh, I was wondering how that worked.  Well that makes sense.
Yeah.  It had a different sound to it than his original stuff.
Yeah, but it was great music too.  I love how his music evolved over the years.
It really did, but it always had great beats and great lyrics.
That's what I love about it.  His tunes are always memorable.
Yeah, not like so much of the bland hip-hop you hear that all sounds the same.
I know it.  He had that great West Coast style, too.
Yeah, in almost all of his songs.
I have a book of poetry he wrote, too.
Man, almost all of his songs were like poetry.
