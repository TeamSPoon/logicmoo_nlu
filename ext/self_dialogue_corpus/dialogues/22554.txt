Have you seen any good movies for the kids lately?
Actually, I just saw Cars 3 the other day. Have you seen the other Cars movies?
Well I have seen the first one about 1000 times, but I haven't seen the second one.
Oh you should, it is very good!
I think my son would like to go see the third one. Is it imperitive that we've seen the second one to see the third?
No, not really. It can stand by itself.
What is the movie about?
Well, Lightning McQueen is getting older and there are a lot of yournger and cooler cars.
This sound like a story I have heard a lot-just with people instead of cars.
Well, it is a familiar story, but it is very good.
How does it end up?
Well everyone wants him to retire, but he decides to give it one last go. The deal is he has to win his first race of the season or retire.
Well, does he?
I am not going to tell you that. Go watch the movie.
Oh fine. Who is your favorite Cars character?
I have always liked Tow Mater. He's a funny guy!
I like him too. My son is obsessed with Lightning McQueen though.
I like him as well. He is such a flashy and arrogant car at the beginning of the first movie, but I like how he changes.
Life lessons learned through Pixar films, huh?
I think there are definite lessons for our kids to learn.
