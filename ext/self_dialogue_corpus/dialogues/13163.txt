How did you feel about Rogue One?
Honestly I did not like it
Oh really? Why?
It wasn't as compelling as the other parts of the series
in what way?
i guess in the setting in general
What wasn't good about it?
Honestly it just felt like it took place on earth, it didn't put me in the same imaginary place as the other parts
i can see how it can be like that
thats why i dont like Rogue One
