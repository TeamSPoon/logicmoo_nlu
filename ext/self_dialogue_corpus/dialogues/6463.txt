Did you hear about the live action Little Mermaid movie that's coming out?
Yes! I'm really excited!
Me too. I loved the cartoon version. Ariel is one of my favorites.
Mine too. Do you know who is playing Ariel?
I haven't heard yet. They'll need a good actress.
They'll need good cast for Eric, Ursula and King Triton too.
I wonder if it's all going to be filmed underwater or on a green screen?
I would think a green screen!
Wouldn't that sort of cheapen it?
Nah, with effects these days it will look great. Besides, they have to add in Flounder and Sebastian!
