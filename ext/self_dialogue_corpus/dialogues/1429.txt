Who is your favorite NFL team?
I actually don't know that much about the NFL. Who is your favorite?
I love the Cleveland Browns.
Oh no, even I know they aren't very good!
This is true. But maybe this year will be different.
I hope so, for your sake! How did they do last year?
They won one game.
Oh no! Who did they beat?
The San Diego Chargers.
I am not too familiar with the Chargers. Are the Browns usually better than that?
Yeah, well in 2015 they were 3-13.
I see. Who is their head coach?
They had a new head coach last year, Hue Jackson.
Oh I don't know anything about him.
He was previously the offensive coordinator for the Bengals.
Oh, where are the Bengals from?
They are Ohio's other team, they are from Cincinnati.
Interesting. Are the Browns going to keep Hue Jackson for next year?
Well, they haven't fired him yet!
Well I hope next year is better for you!
