How did you like Pirates of the Caribbean?
I really liked the original!
It was definitely the best
Orlando Bloom was a very interesting choice for the movie.
I liked how Captain Jack Sparrow was a typical drunk pirate, but was still super dynamic
The music was really good too.
The sequels however were pretty boring
Yupp, its so hard to get quality sequels anymore.
What other good pirate movies are there though?
Not that many
It's probably why Pirates did so well.
Yupp, it was original and had a good story
Treasure Island was one I remember now.
I've never seen it, what was it about?
It was about the pirate Long John Silver
Who was in it?
I think Charlton Heston played the main character
Oh, and Peter Pan was about pirates, kinda.
Yea, that was a classic too!
I wish I could fly around like that
