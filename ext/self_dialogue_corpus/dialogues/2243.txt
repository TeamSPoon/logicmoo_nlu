Heu are you ready for the Patriots to win the superbowl?
Yhea right that is not going to happen.
Your just jealous of how good my team is.
No i feel sad for your team since they have a sad girly quarterback.
Tom Brady is the best in the whole NFL.
Hey just out of curiosity who owns the Patriots
Robert Kraft is the actual owner of The Patriots team.
Do you know when he purchased the franchis and for how much?
He bought the team for 175 million dollars in 1994 from James Orthwein
Wow wish i had that much.
Well my Patriots are definatly worth it.
I can name 3 other teams that are better and still not worth that much.
Really go ahead and try.
For one the Steelers
Please the Patriots stomp them consistently.
No they are pretty equal in wins and losses against each other
ok ill give you that the 2 do put on a pretty good game.
Plus the Steelers have 6 superbowl rings i believe your Patriots only have 5
So The Patriots only need one more to tie them
But we all know that wont happen.
