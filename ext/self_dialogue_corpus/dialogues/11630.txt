So what have you been listening to lately?
I've been going back through my Beatles albums. I love them.
I could never really get into them. What albums should I listen to?
My personal favorite is Rubber Soul. It was the very beginning of their psychedelic period.
Is that the one where they are standing in the street on the album cover?
That's their last album Abby Road. Rubber Soul is from around 1965.
I'll have to check them out. I think my dad has a bunch of their records.
You should definitely listen to them on vinyl especially Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, That one is a classic.
I'll look for that one. Anything else I should listen to.
Every one of their albums is great. I think you would also enjoy the white album.
