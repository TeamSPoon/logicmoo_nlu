So what are you planning on doing today?
I am thinking about just hanging around the house and watching some movies.
What do you plan on watching?
My dad is wanting me to watch a new movie with him that he just bought.
Cool, do you know what the name of it is?
I think it is called Wilson. He said it is a comedy that he has heard good things about.
I have seen previews for that one. It stars Woody Harrelson, right?
Yep, that is the one! My dad has always liked him in movies.
I think he is actually a very underrated actor when you think about it.
I agree with you,and I think my dad would as well!
He has played in some really great movies, but he is rarely talked about as one of the best all time actors.
White Men Can't Jump, Kingpin, and Indecent Proposal were all great movies just to name a few.
They were and he done a great job in all of them. Money Train was another excellent movie that he was in.
Yea I forgot about that one! Who else was in that with him?
It also starred Wesley Snipes and Jenifer Lopez as well. I feel like without him though, the movie would not have been as good.
I agree with you about that.We could set here and name all kinds of great movies that he has been in.
I just do not understand why he never gets the true credit that he deserves!
In my book he is one of the best actors in Hollywood.
I feel the same way! I enjoy the vast majority of all of his films.
I am glad he has got some new movies coming out! Love watching him perform!
