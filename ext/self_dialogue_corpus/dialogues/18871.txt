Did you listen to Death Cab for Cutie's last album?
I gave up on them a long time ago.
Yeah after Transatlanticism I kind of tuned out
Did you like that album?
Definitely it was probably their finest
Yeah but you could not top that
I agree but the albums before that were good as well
Nothing on that level.
I loved The Photo Album
I thought that was their second best
What is your favorite track by them
They look like giants is their best work
I liked the title track from that album.
Thats another strong one
They did a good job.
Did you ever listen to the postal service.
I never heard of it before, what do they sound like.
It was Ben Gibbard's side project
So they sound like death cab
They sound almost the same without many instruments
