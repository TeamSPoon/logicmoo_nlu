I'm not sure which ones I have.
Which ones of... in the series?
Yeah. I know I have the first 5 I think.
Furious 5 is the first film where Rock plays the DSS agent
Yeah, that's why I remember I have it.
i don't even remember what happens in 6 and 7...
In 6 the crew's scattered. And Letty suffers from amnesia, and Dom's sister Mia gets kidnapped, but gets rescued. And Dom drives out of the exploding plane. That's so lame.
Oh Yeah, yeah. Then the 7 is about Letty regaining her memories. And the English guy's brother goes all crazy for vengeance.
yep. Then they go to Abu Dhabi of all places. Then they tried to steal this computer program called God's eye
Oh yeah and they do that air drop thing into some place in Europe. And in the end Letty regains her memories.
