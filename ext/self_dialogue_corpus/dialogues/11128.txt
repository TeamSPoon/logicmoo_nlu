Did you see Levi's re-cut the 501 again?
Yeah, hopefully it fixes the stitching issues on the inseam.
Here's to hoping! Have you seen their other offerings?
Yes, I absolutely love their jackets. For both genders!
I just recently got a denim jacket from them on sale.
Is their construction similar to their other denim?
Yes! Speaking of jackets, what are your thoughts on old military jackets?
They can look nice, but only when it's over-sized and bulky.
Kind of like a grunge look?
Yes, but be careful that's going out for the new Bohemian look.
If I get a military jacket, what boots could go well with it?
I believe I've seen Liam Hemsworth wearing Red Wings and it looked really good.
I love those! It seems old mining boots go well for men and combat boots for women.
Absolutely, Krysten Ritter looks great in combat boots!
Yes! Especially paired with a nice leather jacket.
Too bad leather is prohibitively expense and unethical by some perspectives.
Yeah that's why I elected to choose a faux leather jacket and it's worked surprisingly well.
I have one of those too, it's held out quite well provided the stereotype that it won't hold out as long as real leather.
I want to get one similar to the one Bradley Cooper's been spotted wearing!
With the brown leather? I love it!
