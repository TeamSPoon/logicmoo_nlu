Did you hear that they're going to make a bunch of 'Avatar' sequels?
That's really exciting.
Yea, I really loved the first one.
Me too, though the plot was literally the same as 'Pocahontos.'
True, but nearly every movie is like every other movie that's been made.
How so?
Well, you mention Pocahontos.  But that was also basically 'Dances with Wolves' and 'Last Samurai.'
Good point.
I also think that since film is a visual medium, something as beautiful as 'Avatar' is to be admired.  Even if it wasn't that original, plotwise.
I could agree with that. Like I said, I still really liked that movie.
It blew my mind the first time I saw it in IMAX 3D.
I saw it in IMAX 3D as well.  It's the only movie I ever paid extra to see it in.
I wonder where they'll take the sequels though.
I guess the world Cameron created is so vast that they can keep exploring the rest of Pandora.
But who will be the villain this time?  Other tribes in Pandora, or will Earth people come back?
My money is on the Earth people, but I hope I'm surprised with an antagonist that is completely different.
That would be cool.  Though I'll definitely miss Scott Lang as the villain from the first one.
Oh yeah, he was the best.  Plays an excellent villain.
I sort of wish Scott Lang plays Cable in the next Deadpool movie.
Yes!  That would be incredible.
