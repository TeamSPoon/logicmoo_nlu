Everyone's saying that 'Let it Go' from Frozen is the best Disney song ever.
That's crazy! There are so many songs that are classics.
That's what I said! What about Aladdin's "A Whole New World"?
And "Tale as Old as Time" from Beauty and the Beast?
And even more old school like "When you Wish Upon a Star" from Cinderella?
So we agree, classic Disney still holds up.
Absolutely. Although I do love "Let it Go."
Yeah, it's a great song. And I like the snowman song too.
"Do you Want to Build a Snowman"? Yeah, that's pretty fantastic as well.
So perhaps not the best ever but they can be added to the list of great ones.
