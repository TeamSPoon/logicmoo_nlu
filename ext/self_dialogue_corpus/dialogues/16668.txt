What radio station do you listen to lately?
any station that plays classic rock from the 60s through the 2000s
So you like the old stuff. I used to be into metal myself.
I saw Metallic years ago, they had a great concert.
I remember seeing Ratt. I still enjoy music from my younger years.
yeah the 80s were a great mix of different types.
Clash and Sex pistols were great early punk bands.
Although I liked the hair bands like Van Halen myself.
Well, because Eddie Van Halen was one of the greatest guitarists ever.
True, but I saw Clapton in concert in 1995, and he was great then, and still is.
I know, there doesn't seem to be as much effort put into music lately.
There's a few good musicians, but it seems that lyrics are just silly and redundant.
True, but we had that problem back then too.
Ok true, I mean Devo and Culture Club? Many not as deep as we thought.
Do you like any current music?
I like Adele and Bruno Mars.
I think Lady Gaga is really talented.
She is, and what she did with Tony Bennett was great.
But anyone with a weird name like Fetty Wap or something I can't tolerate.
Agreed. Music has to have some quality and skill.
