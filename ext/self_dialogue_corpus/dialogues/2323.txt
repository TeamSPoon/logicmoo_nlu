Hey man, I can't wait for football season!
Me too! Its going to be a great year for receivers.
Why do you say that?
It seems that offense has been ruling the NFL the past few seasons.
That's true.  Who do you think has the best group of receivers?
The Giants, for sure!
No way! Look at the Patriots this year!
Dude, they are only good because of Brady!
No way! Edelman would hold his own on any team.
That is true, he is shifty.
Brandon Cooks is a beast! He broke 1000 yards and 8 touchdowns in both of the last two seasons!
Wow, that really is impressive.
Yeah it is! and on top of that they have Hogan and Mitchell, both of which have proven they can play.
Yeah maybe you are right, that is a pretty good receiver corps.
The Giants only have Odell anyway.
What about Brandon Marshall?
He is to old now, maybe five years ago he would have made them better.
I think the Jets made him look bad last year.
Yeah, they really did! The Jets made everyone look bad last year!
Yeah, everybody on their team. They made their opponents look great!
