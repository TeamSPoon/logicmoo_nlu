What's your least favorite Star Wars movie?
That would have to be The Phantom Menace, as it just failed to deliver an interesting story line.
Yeah, I agree and it was just ridiculous when they introduced Jar-Jar. I mean who likes that character?
Jar-Jar was such an unnecessary character, but I liked how they introduced the concept of a Grey Jedi.
Qui-Gon Jinn was perhaps the only redeeming character in that movie.
That and the epic fight scene between Obi-Wan, Qui-Gon and Darth Maul.
I really enjoyed that fight scene and the music that accompanied it was awesome.
Do you ever wish that they would make a movie more dedicated to the Sith and their origins?
It would be interesting for sure, as there is so much mystery surrounding the Sith.
Hopefully we will get to see something in the future.
