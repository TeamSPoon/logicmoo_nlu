Who do you think Snoke is?
You mean the theory that he's already a known character?
Yup. I heard some good ones.
Probably Plageius.
How so? He's dead.
So Palpatine thinks. Or, so he WANTS us to think.
Maybe they're in cahoots? And he'll take over with Palpatine dead?
Maybe. I have a good idea.
Who do YOU think Snoke is?
He's a guy named Snoke. He's just old and wise and powerful. he can easily hide.
