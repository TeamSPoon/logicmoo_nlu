Hey Bro, Whats up? I haven't seen you in a long time!
I know! When was the last time again?
It was at the Miami Dolphins home game in the Hard Rock Stadium.
Oh yeah that was such a good game!
So did you buy season tickets for this season?
No unfortunately I could not!
But you know we get a discount from our job this year right?
