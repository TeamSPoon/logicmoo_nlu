I love how complex Disney movies are getting.
I think complexity was always present.  But now it's evolving.
That is what I meant.  Take the movie 'Inside Out,' for instance.
I thoroughly enjoyed that film.
The whole thing was an allegory for puberty and growing up in the world.
I never looked at it that way, but you're right.
The voice acting was also spot on.
Who were some of the actors and actresses?
Amy Poehler and Bill Hader were two of the main voices.
I didn't realize that.  It makes sense that two SNL alum would play such funny characters!
