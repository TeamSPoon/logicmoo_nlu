i love when modern rock bands cover the beatles
oh, that does sound cool.
i'll give you an example. the flaming lips had a whole album!
really. that sounds really cool, i love the flaming lips
their sgt. pepper cover is honestly the coolest thing since sliced bread
i believe it
they did have miley cyrus on a song or two...
wow...automatically less cred
her voice worked really well for the songs, though!
eh, i'll have to hear it to believe it
