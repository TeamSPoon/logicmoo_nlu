Have you seen any good movies lately?
Uh...Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2!
I've wanted to see that. How was it?
Amazing! Just as good as the first!
I'll have to check it out. Any other good ones?
King Arthur was pretty good.
I've heard good things. Who's the guy in it?
Charlie Hunnam. The guy from Sons of Anarchy.
Oh yeah, I loved him on that show.
I also went and saw Baywatch the other day.
How was that?
It was good. Zac Efron and The Rock had good chemistry together.
Ha, I never would have guessed you'd see those two together in a movie.
It sounds crazy but they make it work.
Are you going to go see the new Pirates of the Caribbean movie?
I don't know. I am kind of worn out on them.
Are you kidding? I love them.
I think they just seem to blend together.
You're crazy. Johnny Depp is the best.
He is pretty good. I guess I'll go see it with you.
