Why do you think pop music is so popular in any decade?
Probably because it is so repetitive. It's like brain washing of sorts.
Are you saying that it doesn't take much to entertain the youth.
Yes pretty much  that's exactly what I am saying.
Simple things for simple minds. Yep guilty as charged. I fell victim as well to pop music when I was a kid.
Well think about it if it has the catchy chorus or some other "hook" then you are all set for the big time.
The thing is the "hook" as you put it also helps generate more revenue through clothes that these entertainers wear
Yes that is very true. Good Point.
I am going to leave you now and go put my bell bottoms on and halter top.
Hey don't forget your puka shell necklace.
