This is the year for Andrew Luck.
Do you really think so?
Yes, he is a great quarterback, and he will lead the Colts to the Super Bowl.
Wow, that's a bold prediction for a mediocre team.
That's just how good I think Andrew Luck is.
So he will put the team on his back and carry them through the playoffs?
Yes, and he's been close a couple times before in his short career.
I actually agree with you that he is a top-notch passer.
He's my favorite player, and he's durable and tough.
I followed him a lot more when he was in college at Stanford.
Oh yeah, he was the man when he was in college.
It was crazy how good Stanford was with Luck and Harbaugh there.
Oh yeah, I forgot that Jim Harbaugh coached them for awhile.
Yes, and then he went to the NFL to coach San Francisco, and now he's back in college at Michigan.
That's funny how things change so quickly for coaches and players in sports.
You have to be very willing to move and adapt if you play or coach.
I don't know if I could move my family around that much.
Yes, it must be hard if you have young kids.
I guess that's one of the reasons that these guys get paid big money.
You really have to be committed and love the game in order to uproot your life like that.
