What's one of your favorite 80's movies?
Oh my gosh, there's almost too many to name.  I would say Princess Bride.
Yes, love that one.
I literally watched that movie on repeat as a kid.
Me too!
I would run around the house screaming "hello, my name is Inigo Montoya, you killed my father, prepare to die!"
Haha, yes.  Lot's of good one-liners in that movie.
or, "Inconcievable!"
I like - "you had love in the fire swamp, and you gave it up!"
I'm going to have to go home and watch that one now.
Definitely!  Such a great film.
Yes, I completely agree.  What 80's movies do you like?
I like anything with John Cusack.
oh yeah, Say Anything was another favorite of mine.
I think it was every girl's dream to have a guy stand under her window playing Peter Cetera!
Haha, for sure!
I love Better off Dead.
I love One Crazy Summer.
Ah yes, great movie!
Those twins always creeped me out though!
