Do you like Kid Rock?
Do I, I love Kid Rock.
Me too.
Have you seen some of his music videos?
I have seen several.
I like any video where he is riding a motorcycle.
Me too.
I also like some of the older videos with a large fur coat.
He was quite flamboyant back in the day.
He sure was.
What is your favorite song?
I like most anything.
I think my favorite is "Cowboy".
Yup, that is a good one.
Have you ever been to one of his concerts?
I was supposed to go a few years back.
Why didn't you?
I had a family conflict come up.
That is too bad.
It is, I wish I could have made it.
