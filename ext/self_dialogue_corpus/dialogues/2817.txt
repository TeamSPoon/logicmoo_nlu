Everyone asks about favorite teams, but what I want to know is what is your most despised NFL team?
Personally, I really can't stand the New England Patriots.
I feel like that's a common response to that question.  Why don't you like them.
I don't like them because of their known history of cheating.
I think they were cleared the last time something like that happened.
I don't think they were cleared.  Usually when someone receives a punishment it's because they did something wrong.
Good point.  I'm not much of a Tom Brady fan myself.
He's another reason I don't like the Patriots.
A lot of people like him, but something about him just makes me very suspicious of him.
Agreed.  I do think Bill Belichick is one of the best coaches in the game right now though.
Even though there's been accusations of play stealing?
Even with that I think he's one of the best coaches.
What do you think of Sean Payton?
Anyone that offers a reward for injuries in a game like this should be banned from the game.
There have been a few incidents of obvious intent to injure in the last few seasons.
But there's a difference between losing control of emotion on the play field and offering players compensation for causing injuries.
I suppose you're right.
Ever since that incident I've completely hated Sean Payton.
Do you feel the same way about Drew Brees?
No, I think he's a decent enough person and definitely a good enough player.
