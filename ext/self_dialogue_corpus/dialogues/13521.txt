Why do you think Star Wars never has a solid family unit?
Well, Luke had one in the beginning of Epsiode 6.
Yes, but his family was quickly killed. So was Leia's.
It does seem like parents are always dying, doesn't it?
I can't think of a single family unit that stays together.
They continued the trend in the new movies as well. Anakin leaves his mom and she later dies.
Yes, and Rey doesn't have parents either.
I wonder if maybe its just too hard to let the protagonist run off to adventures if there is someone keeping tabs on them.
That is a valid point, but you would think at least one character would at least have both parents until adulthood.
Technically, Han and Leia both survive until their child is an adult, not that it turns out particularly well for them...
