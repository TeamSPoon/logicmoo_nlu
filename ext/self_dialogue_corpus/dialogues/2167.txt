Did you watch the last Superbowl?
Yes I did It was a fun Superbowl.
I know, I dont think Ive seen a more exiting Superbowl that last years.
Where did you see it?
I was with a couple of friends at my apartment and just had like a little party.
Oh thats cool, so were you rooting for an espefic team?
I was, I wanted the Patriots to win so badly.
Im guessing you were pretty happy with the outcome then!
I was it was a great comeback, did your support a particular team?
No, not really I just wanted to watch the game but was exited to see that comeback.
I know it was pretty cool, we were all down becaues we thought that Patrios were going to lose.
Well It was a hard feat, I dont think many teams have recovered from that and win.
I think its the only team that has done that feat.
I like that they never gived up althought things were lost.
I know, I couldnt believe it when they won.
Im guessing the party got a lot better.
Yeah we had a great time the comeback inspired us all.
Do you think the Patrios will do well this season?
I dont know, I ve heard they hired good players this years so they might repeat the titlle.
I think that they have the potential but the competition is pretty hard.
