Have you seen the new Vin Diesel movie?
Oh you mean the one that already has like what 7 or 8 parts to it?
Yes the one that is number 8. My husband took me to it and I thought that it couldn't be any good.
And let me guess there was a lot of crashes and stealing of cars and hot sexy men.
Yes, but there was actually a good story line to it. It actually had all the adventure and of course hot cars and Vin Diesel and the Rock.
I didn't know the Rock played in it.
He returns back as head of the group leading a mission. And of course he had his big gun along side. Nathan Staten was in it.
I like my Nathan Staten movies. I might have to go and see it this weekend.
I promise you will not be disappointed. It takes on a whole new flavor.
Wasn't Nathan Staten a bad guy in one of the previous movies?
He was but it was great. They are able to get the bad guys and the good guys all on the same page to go after a really bad guy.
Now you really have me interested in going and seeing it.
I loved how the writers just put the twists and the turns in the movie.
Suprisingly most of the franchise movies are the same over and over again. That's why I was not interested at first.
They actually did a good job writing in the most of the scenes and made them a little more convincing.
It is hard to believe that this movie was made without Paul Walker. Did they write him out completely?
No they just made his character retire. I sure do miss that handsome guy.
I will have to find a friend to go with me to watch it since my husband doesn't really like the movies.
I'm free on Saturday and I wouldn't mind seeing muscles and sexy cars again.
That sounds good. I can't wait to go.
