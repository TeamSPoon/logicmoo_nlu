Do you like the movie Alice in Wonderland? It's my favorite Disney movie.
I think that's a great movie! Old, but great!
Yes, it was made in 1951. Kathryn Beaumont voiced Alice's character.
Ed Wynn was the voice for the Mad Hatter. He was hilarious!
To be honest, the Mad Hatter annoyed me.
Why?
He was really crazy. His character was too much for me. I liked the white rabbit.
Tweedledee and Tweedledum were great. Oh and the Cheshire Cat!
Yes, the Cheshire Cat was awesome. I liked how he'd disappear.
Everytime I see a flamingo I think about the game of croquet...
