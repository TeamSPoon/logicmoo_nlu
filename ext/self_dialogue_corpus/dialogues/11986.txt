If you could be one character from star wars movies , who would it be?
Since I am female  I would have to say lea.
Really why? The new females are so much more empowered.
Well I loved the original star wars movies the most. I also love that gold bikini and adore Han solo.
Fair enough reasons. The other newer females don't really have any love interest do they?
Well with rae she sort of does, but not as clear if that will develop or not. But not as overt.
That is true, I was just thinking we left out the whole romance of queen amidala.
Oh yes, I did blank on that. She was not as fun or witty but did have beautiful costumes.
I agree. Much stiffer character than lea. But great costume design.
I forgot to ask your favorite star wars  movie character, sorry.
