I just watched Green Room and I will never look at Patrick Stewart the same way again.
I know! He was really creepy as the neo-Nazi.
You saw it, too? What did you think?
I liked it. It was brutal but human and kind of darkly funny at times.
It was too brutal for me, I had to look away a lot.
Yeah, the special effects team had a lot of fun with this one.
I liked how creative some of the survival strategies were. If I was being hunted down by neo-Nazis I would die so fast.
Well, do not book a gig in a skinhead bar and you should be okay!
Most of all, I felt kind of bad for the dogs.
Even the ones eating people?
