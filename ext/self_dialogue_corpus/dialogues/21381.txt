So, seen any good movies lately?
Yeah, I saw Guardians of the Galaxy 2.
Oh, yeah I wanted to see that one, was it any good?
Yes, my son and I thought it was great.
I thought the previews were really funny.
The best part is there are a lot more funny scenes than what they show in the trailer.
I really liked the songs they used in the trailers.
Yeah me too, my favorite was the one by Fleetwood Mac.
Is the rest of the soundtrack as good as the first one?
Yes, although there are quite a few obscure songs too.
So were all of the main characters back in this one?
Yes all of the guardians are back as well as a few new characters.
Does Vin Diesel still play Groot's voice?
Yes, he did the voice again in this movie and was great.
What other actors/actresses were in this movie?
There were a few new ones like Kurt Russel, Slyvester Stallon, and Pom Klementieff.
When did you go see the movie?
I went last weekend with my son during the matinee.
Cool, should I see the movie in 3D?
No, they didn't release a 3D version of this movie.  It is definitely a great movie though.
