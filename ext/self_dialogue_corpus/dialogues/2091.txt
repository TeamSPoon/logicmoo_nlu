Hey, how is it going?
Pretty good. You catch that panthers game last night?
Yea, it was great.
Cam is really coming into his own in the NFL.
He's had a few good seasons to be sure. Can't forget that super bowl performance though.
I think that was nerves more than anything else; he looked jittery.
Sure, but that's part of being a quarterback. He didn't look jittery last night.
I guess the pressure isn't as bad during regular season.
You think they will go all the way this year?
Don't know, but they looked pretty solid.
Maybe. Still looks like some problems on the offensive line.
You talking about the right tackle?
Yea ha ha, he didn't seem to be on the same page as the rest of the line.
Well he is a rookie. Can't expect him to just pick up and run with it until he has some time to practice with the team.
Sure, sure. I'm pulling for the Saints this year anyways.
The Saints? Really?
Yea. Really liked what they did last year, and they picked up some good players in the draft.
I see.
Well we better get back to work, talk to you later.
Sure, see you around.
