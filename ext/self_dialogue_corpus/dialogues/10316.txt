Any good action movies you can suggest for us?
Do you mean old or new?
Either. We are getting sick of comedies.
How about Assault on Precinct 13.
Is that the one with Ethan Hawke?
Yes. Did you ever see it?
No actually we never watched that one.
Well, it's a good one.
That's a remake isn't it?
I believe it is. Very good movie.
