Have you ever seen wait until dark?
The one with audrey hepburn?
Yes, I assume from that response you have.
Indeed I have. It was such a different role for her.
Yes you don't typically think of her in a thriller.
True or as a blind woman.
Very true. She was very real in that role, got to show she had a wider range than thought.
I have always thought of audrey hepburn as talented.
Me as well but I feel a lot of her popularity had to do with her style and charm not always talent.
To some degree I agree very known for her fashion. But she is talent all the same.
