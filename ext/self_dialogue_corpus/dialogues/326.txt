Are you anticipating any of the new superhero movies coming out this year?
Yes, i can't wait to see the Justice League movie.
I hope they do a good job on it because if not Marvel is going to be dominating the genre for the next few years.
I agree with you but i am totally hype to see Jason Momoa play Aquaman.
Isn't that the guy from Game of Thrones?
Yeah, he's a pretty good actor and i'm glad to see him get a major role in such a big budget film.
Ben Affleck portrayal of Batman was pretty good in the last movie.
I think as the films progress he will grow more comfortable in the role and make it more believable.
Hope Chris Terrio did a good job with the screenplay for it.
With such legendary characters it shouldn't be to difficult at all.
