Do you Think Kobe Bryant is better than Lebron James?
No because Lebron is better.
But Kobe has 5 championships.
That's not fair because he has played 20 seasons.
But he's been to the finals the same amount of times as Lebron which gave them equal opportunity.
True but Lebron's career is not over.
I'm just saying you can't be better than someone and not have more championships.
Robert Horry has more championships than Michael Jordan does that make him better than him?
I guess you have a point there.
I will admit Kobe has had a better career than Lebron.
Doesn't that make him better?
No because just because he had a better career doesn't mean he is more skilled.
Please elaborate.
Lebron is a more skilled player than Kobe but Kobe has been around longer.
What skills does Lebron have that Kobe doesn't?
Lebron can pass, rebound, play defense, run and EVERYTHING else.
So what you're saying is that Kobe is good at some things but Lebron is good at everything?
Yes, Kobe never shot above 47 percent from the field in a season but Lebron has shot 57 percent from the field in a season.
So I see, Kobe has had the better career but Lebron is a better player.
Exactly.
