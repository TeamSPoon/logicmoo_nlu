who is the best grunge band
thats a tough one
what is your favorite
probably nirvana
mine too.
alice in chains were the most technical though
i loved down in a hole by them
stone temple were underrated
yeah. creep was so good
i liked their creep better than radioheads creep
me too.
i never liked pearl jame
i only liked their hit songs
nirvana were simple but powerful
their melodies were important
even kurt valued melody over lyrics
yeah, his lyrics were a mess
you cant tell what hes saying
or what hes talking about
thats part of the beauty i guess
