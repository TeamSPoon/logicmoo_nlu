I have been going down memory lane lately.
In what way?
Looking at old photos, reading favorite books again, favorite music.
Music can take you right back to a specific day, or even moment.
I know.  For instance, 'Sultans of Swing' makes me think of that horrible day we had to evacuate because of Three Mile Island.
Lets think of more.
I remember being in my bedroom on Franklin St. and listening to the Kinks, James Taylor and Neil Young.
You are old.  Ha ha!
Not funny!  I remember listening to U2's Joshua Tree album when I was in love with a crazy Irish person, driving all around, whe I REALLY should not have been driving.
I think of discovering Guy Clark from a boyfriend that broke my heart.  It was wodth it to discover Guy Clark!
I remember getting a pair of leather boots exactly like Keith Emerson had.  I thought I was really cool!
Same thing here, only it was Steppenwolf and a fringed rawhide vest!  That was my first concert.
My first album was the Herman's Hermits.  I got it for Christmas the same year I got my first mini skirt!
Listening to George Harrisons Dark Horse album non stop and going to Philadelphia to see him!
What is horrifying is that I remember a short phase of listening to lack Sabbath and Alice Cooper when I was in high school.
NO WAY!!! Say it ain't so!
I snapped out of it soon and listened to the Kinks.
I remember trying to get to New York City to see Guy  Clark and being heartbroken that I couldn't.  Soon after, I was in Galway, Ireland and got to see him in a little tiny place!
Similar time here, only it was Jesse Colin Young, in Montreal.
Life without music....can't bear to imagine it.
