You know what the new Star Wars movies need?
More actions? More drama?
A killer cyborg.
That took an unexpected turn.
In the original trilogy, you had Darth Vader. In the prequels you had General Grievous, but in the new movies, nothing.
Snoke could be a cyborg for all we know?
Even if he is, he hasn't killed anyone, so it hardly counts.
I see your point.
It's one of those classic Star Wars motifs. It needs to be brought back.
To be fair, Saw Gerrera was pretty mean, and he had a cybernetic leg. But I guess that doesn't really count for several reasons.
