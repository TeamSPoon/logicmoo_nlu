It was old school music day at work today.
That sounds cool. Was it fun?
Yes it was. I really enjoyed the music they played.
You enjoyed it? I didn't think you were into old music.
I didn't I would like it either but you know they made some good music way back when.
It's better than the stuff you hear on the radio today.
You are not lieing.  I really like a song by the name of Head Over Heels.
By Tears for Fears? I love that song.
I knew you would have heard of them, mom.
Boy, that was my generation. I grew up listening to and loving that song.
I can see why. Some incredible music came out of the 80's.
I think the best music came from that decade.
I don't know about all of that but I do know Tears For Fears made some beautiful music.
Have you heard their song,Everybody Wants to Rule the World?
I googled them at work and I watched their videos on you tube.
What did you think of it?
That song rocks. The beat, the melody, everything was perfect.
I am so glad to hear you say this.
Why?
Because I have been telling you for years that my music was worth listening to. I feel vindicated!
