What is your favorite type of music?
I love hip hot/rap.  Well, I use to
What do you mean
I love rap of the 90's and early 2000's.  I loved artist like the Beastie Boys,  Jay Z, Wu Tang, KRS ONE, Mobb Deep, Redman, and the last great rapper, Eminem.
You don't like rap today.  You don't like Drake?
I really don't.  I saw him do comedy and he was good but I think his music sucks.
I actually like drake a lot.
I respect that, I just don't think it's god.  It is nothing like the real rap of the old days.
What should I listen to then?
You should try The Fugees or Wu Tang
What was your favorite album?
It's hard to choose.  The Beastie Boys "License to Ill" is a classic.
Anyone else that is good.
Hell yeah, you should listen to Nas.  He was amazing.
What did you like about these artists?
The actually raps themselves.  they just flowed and you could get jiggy with it.
Jiggy with it?  what is that?
Buy a Jay Z album.
Ok, i'll have to check some of it out?
YOu want be disappointed.  I didn't even get into other greats such as Dr Dre, Snoop Dog, DMX, etc.
