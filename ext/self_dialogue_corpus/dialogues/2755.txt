Marcus Mariota will recover from his injury and lead the Titans to a 12 win season!
Wow that's a lot of confidence in Mariota.
Mariota showed that he was one of the leagues best quarterbacks last season when he was healthy and he barely had any weapons to work with.
I like Mariota better then Jameis Winston but I don't think he has enough to lead the Titans to a 12 win season.
Looking at the Titans division I think they have the best team.
That's true other than the Texans I don't see the Colts or Jaguars as posing much of a threat.
I can't fully rule out Andrew Luck with the Colts because he's such a good quarterback.
He is talented but he takes a lot of risk and gambles.
I think that's what it takes to be a star quarterback. You have to have the talent and confidence to take those chances.
He threw a lot of interceptions last season though.
Well the Colts trailed in a lot of games so they were forced to pass a lot.
That's true when you have to play from behind the defenses can predict what you're going to do and play accordingly.
Exactly, and for Luck to be able to come through in those situations proves that he's a talented quarterback.
Right, that's why I think the Colts aren't completely dead in the water even with the new roster they're fielding this year.
I just feel like the Titans have their team and they're sticking with Mariota as the face of their franchise. He's confident and everyone believes in him.
I do like his wide receivers. They're not household names but they get the job done.
They just need the running game to come alive this season again. That'll help out their offense by so much.
Do you think DeMarco Murray will hold up for another season?
DeMarco Murray is a tank I think he'll do what he did last season and with Derrick Henry backing him up to give him a breather they'll be fine.
It'll be exciting to watch how the Titans perform this season. I hope Mariota fully recovers from that broken leg.
