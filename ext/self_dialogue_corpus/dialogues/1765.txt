Do you like the Colts?
I do actually.
Is it your favorite team?
It is indeed.
Mine too.
Maybe we should watch a game together.
Sounds good to me.
Why do you like them?
One player got me to love them.
Who is that?
Dwight Freeny.
Why him, isn't he a defensive player too?
Yes he is.
Why do you like him now?
Right, he was a small defensive end pass rusher.
He was rather unique.
His spin move was the best in the game.
I agree with that it was great.
I miss him.
He retired early.
