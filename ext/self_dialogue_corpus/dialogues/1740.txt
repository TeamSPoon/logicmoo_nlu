You see that Giants and Steelers game last night.
I watched the first half. The Giants didn't do anything.
Yea, but they played a little better in the second half.
Yea, it was weird. The Steelers scored in some strange ways.
They had 4 field goals and a safety.
I know. I didn't even want to watch the second half.
I watched the whole thing until the end.
Say, what was the final score anyway?
The Giants scored 14 but the Steelers scored 24 points.
How many yards did Roethlisberger pass for?
He had about 289 yards.
What about Manning? How did he do?
Manning had less passing yards with 195.
Who was the Giants rush leader?
Perkins led the Giants with only 38 rush yards.
The Steelers shut down the rush game for the Giants.
Yep, Eli had to rely on his keen passing to stand a chance.
Who led the Steelers with rushing yards?
LeVeon Bell had 118 rushing yards.
Okay. We will see how the games go next week.
