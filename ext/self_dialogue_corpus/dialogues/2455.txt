Are you ready for the upcoming NFL season?
I am, but honestly I like college football better.
No way. NFL is so much better than college ball.
I disagree. College football has the rivalries. The color. The music. So much more.
Maybe so, but you have to admit the quality of NFL is so much better.
Agreed in big games. But watching a bad NFL team play a strong NFL team can be pretty boring.
True but the same can be said for college football.
I will agree with that. But I love to watch my college's team.
But don't you feel the same towards your pro team.
They are the Browns so not really. Just joking. I agree but not quite as much.
Who do you think will win this year?
Well the Patriots are always good. Same with Seatlle, Denver, Green Bay.
I agree. To me the NFL season really gets going around Thanksgiving.
Agreed. Especially with cold weather, snow, etc.
Yep, and what is it with warm weather teams and domes. That and to much artifical turf.
I like watching the snow games and rainy games. Much better than 70 degrees inside.
So who wins it this year?
I will go out on a limb and pick the Patriots
Pretty big limb you are going out on. I am picking Green Bay.
Safe pick. Well should be fun to watch. See ya.
