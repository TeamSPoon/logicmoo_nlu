Who you picking to get to the Superbowl this year?
Tough one, man. Let me tell you who I want.
Ok. Who then?
I want the Falcons back.
Who else.
Not the Patriots. That's for sure. Raiders or Broncos.
Ok. Now why do you like those match-ups?
First. I'm a Falcon fan. Last year. That's rough. That's just a rough way to end the year.
Agreed. What else you got?
So with the Raiders, I want to see Carr at full health. And of course Marshawn. I feel like he got robbed a few years back, you.
Yeah. I can understand that. What else on those two teams, Oak and Denver?
So, I know with all the Warriors' success, it's not like Oakland's in no-man's land or anything. I just feel like it would be great to win before they leave. I also just want Lynch to blow it up, you know?
I do. I do. And the Broncos?
Mostly fan base. NFL hype. You know, either of those match-ups, Denver-Atlanta, Oakland-Atlanta. It'll be good PR. I mean, it'll be a lot of hype and lots of folks'll watch.
Yeah. Yeah. For me, just my bias, I'd like to see Oakland.
They've got a good shot. Too much can go wrong, though, you know. Always too much can go wrong.
Yup. But it'd be good. Man Raider nation would go crazy if they make it to the Superbowl, even more if it happens before they move.
Oh, I know, right? I would definitely tune in for that. "Must See TV," for sure.
So the A versus Oakland or Denver? I could live with that.
Yeah, man. Here we go!
