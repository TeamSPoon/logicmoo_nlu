Justin Timberlake, for sure!
I love Justin Timberlake!
His new album is absolutely amazing.
The 20/20 Experience is one of my favorite albums of all time!
What is your favorite song on it?
It is so hard to choose. Probably Suit and Tie.
That is a really good one. Mine is probably Blue Ocean Floor.
Oh, that is a great one too! I am surprised you chose that.
