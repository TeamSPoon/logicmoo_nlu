I can never get enough of that movie.
What movie is that?
The Titanic
I have yet to see that movie.
Are you serious?
Yes.
I can't believe you!
Do you expect me to see every movie that comes out?
No, but Leonardo DiCaprio stars in it!
Really? He's so dreamy to look at.
Who are you telling? I'm one of his biggest fans.
I'd like to think of myself as a true fan also.
Do yourself a favor and check out that movie as soon as possible.
With my bad memory, I'll have to write it down somewhere.
Lol. You're so silly.
Silly but oh so true.
Are you busy right now?
No. What's up?
I'm coming over with the dvd.
Great! I'll get the popcorn ready.
