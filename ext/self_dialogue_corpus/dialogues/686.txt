So who do you think will win the NFC division in 2017?
That's a hard question to answer there are so many good teams.
I know but if you had to narrow it down.
Well Atlanta obviously since they won the division last year.
Yeah despite the meltdown in the Superbowl I still expect them to be good this season.
That game was kind of a fluke. They went up early and got careless. Only the Patriots could have made that comeback.
Yeah it was a crazy game. Besides Atlanta who else do you think has a chance?
The Cowboys for sure.
What? The Cowboys. You really think they have a chance?
Did you watch them at all last season?
Yeah I watched their playoff game against Green Bay which they lost.
Barely lost. If they would have won I think they may have been able to beat Atlanta.
I don't know about that. What makes you think they will be better this next season?
There offense will be at least as good or better than last season.
Yeah but what about there defense?
They drafted defense very heavy and picked up some solid players.
You think a squad of rookies can carry a defense?
They still have some solid veterans like Sean Lee in the mix.
Yeah that guy was really good in the games I saw him play in.
He is one of the cornerstones for their defense. If the rookies can play a part the Cowboys can make a playoff run.
