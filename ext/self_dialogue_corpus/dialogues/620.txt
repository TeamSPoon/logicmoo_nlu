Do you think Jerry Rice is the best NFL receiver ever?
Without a doubt.
I think so too but there have been some great ones.
Yeah, tons. Like Randy Moss.
yeah, Moss was good. Especially when he was with the Vikings.
Yeah, he was a beast there.
I bet the Vikings will be pretty good this year.
Even without Adrian Peterson?
Yeah, I think they will be better off without him.
He was pretty good for awhile.
Yeah, that year he almost beat the record, that was great.
He is getting old though.
Yeah.
I just hope the Patriots don't win again this year.
They need to stop winning Super Bowls haha.
Yes! Leave some for the rest of us.
It has been so long since my team has won.
Mine too, who is your favorite team?
Chicago Bears. Yours?
Dallas Cowboys.
