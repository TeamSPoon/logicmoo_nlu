I was on a date with a girl last night, and she told me she had never seen any of the original Star Wars movies.
How can that be?
She said that they felt too slow for her as a kid.
Are you going to watch them then?
Yeah, I was going to try to make it happen.
Seems like a good third or fourth date.
Exactly. And I feel like they're such a cultural touchstone.
Like Harry Potter or Lord of the Rings.
Right. If you haven't seen them, so many jokes just go over your head.
That's definitely true.
Which is your favorite?
Definitely Empire.
Everyone always says that. Why?
I think it's the most complicated of the three. It's gripping.
Hmm. I get that, but I've always liked Return of the Jedi best.
Why? It's so predictable.
Yeah, but a predictable movie isn't a bad one. It's a satisfying ending.
I don't know, I really prefer to be hooked the whole time.
I guess that's fine. Either way, I'm starting with A New Hope.
Can't go wrong there.
