Did you hear Primus is going on tour?
I didn't! How much are tickets?
When I last looked they were about $50.
That's not too bad for a show.
Yeah and Clutch is opening up for them.
I don't think I know them very well.
They're not very popular but they're not bad.
Does Primus have a new album?
I think they came out with one a few months back.
That's cool. Les Claypool really knows how to play.
The guy is amazing on bass!
He plays a fretless one! How does he do that?!
The guy truly is amazing.
Did you know he auditioned to be in Metallica?
No way!
True story. He didn't get in though.
Why didn't he get in the band?
Metallica said he was too good for them.
Well that makes sense.
True. It would have been cool to see them together though.
