Are you a Taylor Swift fan?
A little bit yeah.  Are you?
Kind of.  I can't help it, her music is catchy.
Yeah I agree.
I did lose a bit of respect for her during the whole Kanye thing last year.
Yeah me too.
She kind of went MIA after that.
Yea totally, wouldn't you though?
Probably.  I like Kanye's music, do you?
Yeah, I think he's pretty talented and creative.
Totally.
I really like Jay Z.
Yeah, he's good.
I think he's a rapping genius, he makes such great  music.
What about Eminem?
Yeah, I've always loved his stuff.
What other music do you like?
I like a lot of pretty mainstream stuff.
Do you like Lady Gaga?
Yes, I love her music.  I'm obsessed with the Million Reasons song.
