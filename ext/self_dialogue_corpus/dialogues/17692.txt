So, what all did you get for your birthday?
I got a lot of CD's that I have been wanting!
Did you get any new ones that I would be familiar with?
I got the new Katy Perry album!
Cool,I am a huge Katy Perry fan! How is the album?
I love it, have you heard any of the songs from it?
Is that song Chained To The Rhythm on it?
Yes it is! That one is probably my favorite song on the entire album.
Yea I like it a lot myself. What other songs are on there?
I am sure you have heard that song Swish Swish, right?
Is that the one featuring Nicki Minaj?
Yes, it is a really good song in my opinion.
Yea I know that one! Does that album have Bon Appetit on it as well?
It sure does! Those three songs have been released as singles before the album came out.
I thought so; I think I need to go buy this album as well!
You really should! I would recommend it to any Katy Perry fan.
Are there any songs that were not previously released that you discovered you liked on there?
There are two that I had not heard before that I really love.
Which ones were they?
Miss You More and Mind Maze are both really good songs on the album!
