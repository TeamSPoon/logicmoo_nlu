What is your favorite Rocky movie?
Rocky IV. That's the one with the Russians, right?
That was an awesome Cold War-era movie. However, I think that Red Dawn was my favorite Soviet-themed movie from that period.
Also a great film. I love Patrick Swayze movies!
Me too! Ghost and Dirty Dancing are two of my favorite 80s movies.
Yeah, but Roadhouse is kind of cheesy.
That's what makes the film so awesome. The 1980s was the era of ridiculous action stars like Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger.
Very true. Do you think that we'll ever have movies like Terminator or Rambo again?
Unfortunately no. Nowadays, movies are more difficult to make, so studios are less likely to make movies not based on popular source material.
That would explain the proliferation in comic book movies over the past decade.
Yeah, although the Avengers is still a great franchise.
It's fun, but they rely way too much on explosions and the plots can be thin.
If you're going to an Avengers film expecting to find an amazing plot, you're probably missing the point.
True. However, I thought the Ironman movies had the right mix of plot, action, and humor.
I would agree with that assessment for the first and third Ironman films. However, Ironman 2 was weird.
Totally agree. I just felt that once they started to weave the Avengers narrative Iron Man 2, things started to get unnecessarily complicated.
Yeah. It seems like DC Comics is starting to copy Marvel in that respect in their films today.
The problem with DC Comics is that they haven't made any good films yet. Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice was terrible.
Yeah, although Wonder Woman is supposedly really good.
Really? I should probably check it out then.
