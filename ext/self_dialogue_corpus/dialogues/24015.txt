Are you still a fan of Nightmare Before Christmas?
Definitely!
Okay, I wasn't sure. I know you liked it a lot as a kid.
I did, but it's one of those movies that has stood the test of time.
It is a pretty cute movie. I like the character of Jack.
Jack is pretty cool. I like the mayor, the ghost dog zero and sally, oh and sally's father.
All the characters were so creatively designed.
Yeah! Every time I see it I appreciate something new about the characters' aesthetics and eccentricities.
I like that it's not completely morbid though and it actually pretty heartwarming.
It it very heartwarming. Come to think of it all my favourite christmas movies are pretty morbid though.
Oh yeah?
Yeah, like Gremlins, and the depression and suicidalness in It's a Wonderful Life.
Those are all great movies.
Yeah. Know what my favourite part of Nightmare Before Christmas is though?
What?
The music. I feel like every single song is written and performed well.
They are, and they are so catchy!
Yeah they definitely have a tendency to get stuck in my head.
"This is Halloween" gets stuck in my head a lot.
For me it's "What's this?"
