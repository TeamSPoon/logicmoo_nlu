Do you listen to old pop music from when you were growing up?
I sure do. Stuff I didn't really like at the time is enjoyable now because of the nostalgia.
Who are some of the artists that you listen to now that you never would have before.
That would probably include NSync and the Backstreet Boys.
I know the girls sure go wild for those songs when they hear them come on at a bar.
It takes them back to when they were teenagers.
Do you still listen to pop music today?
There are some pop artists that I like. I think Adele is really good.
She is an amazing singer.
There aren't too many artists like that anymore. She is a throwback to artists that were popular just because of their talent level.
