Have you seen Seven?
Yeah it was pretty good.  That was a total mind bend.
Yeah, both Brad Pitt and Keven Spacey at their best.
The ending was classic too.  Who doesn't know "What's in the box?"
Yeah, often copied by people.  Even when joking around outside of media.
That's what happens with classic movies.
I know, the movie had such a great plot.
I agree, killing the people in the same way of their deadly sin.
Yep, technically he won in the end.
Because Brad Pitt killed him.  With wrath like he wanted.
