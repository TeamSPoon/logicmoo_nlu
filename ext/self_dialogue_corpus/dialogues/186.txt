If you had to choose between batman and superman who would you choose?
Thats a tough one but i think i am going to go with batman
I asked you that because of the movie "batman vs superman: dawn of justice" where the world had to decide what type of hero they needed
Oh i see i didnt really like the movie even though i am a batman fan
Yea i agree, it was too much killing in it but i like how they had a cameo with wonder woman in it
Yea i was really disappointed in the fight scene where batman and superman go at each other
I agree i felt like the whole movie they just complained about each other, i even felt that batman came off as a big bully the entire film
Yea i agree they did make his character unengaged
i really didnt like the way they left people thinking that superman was dead!
Yea we all know superman is not dead especially with the movie "Justice League" coming out theres no jusitce league without superman!
