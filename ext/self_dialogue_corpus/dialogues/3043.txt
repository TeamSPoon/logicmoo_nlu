It is pretty amazing that Pete Carroll has been able to sustain a contender in Seattle.
Yea, that has been nothing short of amazing. He has done a good job.
Yea, he is tough on his players and committed to winning.
Well, it was always the same at USC.
Yea, but that doesn't always translate. We find that out often right?
Yea, we sure do! Especially with Chip Kelly.
Yea, I agree, but Pete Carroll is more polished and seems like he can handle the business.
Well, didn't he try the NFL earlier in his career?
He might have, but this time, he is successful.
Yea, its pretty amazing that he was able to come to the NFL and have success right away.
Yea, I mean, it helps that he was surrounded by an amazing defense too.
Yea, that defense has been feared for years. Teams are scared of them.
Agreed! And with that crowd and that defense, nobody wants to play there.
I feel like their magic is starting to ware off a little bit, but some is still there.
I agree. I just feel like more teams are starting to rise up.
Yea, well theres only so many years you can stand above everybody else.
Yea, eventually they start pushing back.
I agree! Atlanta may be the class of the conference now.
Yea, they sure do have a great team!
I agree! We will find out just how good this year.
