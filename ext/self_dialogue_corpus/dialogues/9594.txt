Did you hear about Bam Bam Carter?
OMG. So awful. I loved his music. I'm a big rap and hip-hop fanatic.
Who else do you like?
I'm kind of into DJ Khaled right now.
Me too. I like "Wild Thoughts" with Rihanna.
That's a great track. I love "Glow Up" and "I'm the One".
I heard "Wild Thoughts" is number-one in the UK right now.
Cool. What do you think of Chance the Rapper?
I love Chance the Rapper.
I think DJ Khaled and Chance the Rapper have collaborated on some songs.
