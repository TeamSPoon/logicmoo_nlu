After Beauty and the Beast, what other classic movie do you think they will turn into a live-action film?
I heard they plan to do that with the Lion King.
Do you think that would work? Since there aren't any people in the movie?
They will be using CGI animals.
Isn't that basically the same as animating them?
Pretty similar I guess. But it will look more real.
I love the Lion King and the music is great, so I would still go see it.
Yeah, I would too.
I guess it is a good idea for Disney to do.
I guess so too.
