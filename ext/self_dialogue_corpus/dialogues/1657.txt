Hey are you ready for the NFL season?
Yeah I'm getting pretty excited. Summer is so boring for sports
Yeah, The draft in April always gets me pumped for the season
Yeah! Training camp is going to start soon.
Are you planning on going to any teams' training camps?
No but I always follow each team's news
Yeah, me too.
Who you got this year in the super bowl?
I'm not sure. The Cowboys looked really good last year and then choked in the playoffs.
Yeah, I could see that happening again this year. I like the Raiders this year.
Yeah, Derek Carr is a beast.
Definitely. The Patriots are going to be contenders again this year.
I know! When do you think Tom Brady will retire?
Not sure. Probably never! That man is a machine.
I know. I think he'll definitely win one more super bowl before he retires
Yeah, for sure. He is the greatest of all time, by far.
Easily. Who do you think the next great quarterback will be?
I think Prescott or Carr. They are both looking very promising.
Yes, but the competition just isn't there. The golden age of quarterbacks seems to be over.
True. We will see what happens. No one can predict the future.
