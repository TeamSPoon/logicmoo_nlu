Hey.  Do you want to go see the Race to Witch Mountain with me?
The reboot with Dwayne The Rock Johnson? Yeah I do!
Carla Gugino is in it too.  She plays the astrophysicist.
Back in the day, I tried so hard to do my lipstick like hers in the Bon Jovi Always video. And she really rocked that hat!
Great, we'll go see it in the theater together....do we want to bring our kids?
Is it really responsible to take them to a movie without watching it first?
Probably not.  Even with Disney movies, it's important to know what your kids are watching.
OK. So we will leave the children home, for their own sakes.
Yes.  It has nothing to do with wanting to go see a movie with The Rock without dragging around our children.
We are so selfless.
