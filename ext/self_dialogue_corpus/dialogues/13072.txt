It's amazing how much influence Star Wars has on pop culture these days.
Now that you mention it, I saw something Star Wars related in a video game recently.
Let's hear it!
Well, the video game was a Chinese knockoff of a game called Overwatch.
Okay? Where is this going?
One of the playable characters in the game was legitimately a Stormtrooper with a different name!
Really? That sounds ridiculous.
It is. I wound up playing Battlefront for hours after seeing that just to get it out of my mind.
I don't like video games at all. I'd rather be watching the movies.
