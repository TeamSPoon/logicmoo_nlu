Do you consider Weird Al Yankovic to be music?
Somewhat yes but also somewhat no.
I agree I am not sure it is fair to call what he does music.
He basically just takes good songs and writes parody lyrics. His original songs are mostly silly.
That isn't how music should be made.
Call him a parody artist or a joker. I can't call him a musician.
Exactly Weird Al isn't really the first choice at weddings or even birthday parties.
The other thing is his lyrics are often crass and sophmoric.
I know he is just trying to get cheap laughs from little kids who still find swear words to be funny.
He isn't all bad but I definitely don't think it's fair to compare him to the artists he makes fun of.
Some of his parodies were good don't get me wrong such as White & Nerdy and Canadian Idiot.
Yes he can make me laugh but again both of those original songs are also good.
Yeah while the parodies are good the reason we like them is partially because of the original songs.
People seem to forget that when they listen to parodies.
I heard Weird Al is getting a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.
Well I guess we can't really hate on him to much then. He is sucessful at what he does.
Yeah even if we can't call him a musician we can call him a success.
He is definitely one of the best parody artists.
Exactly you know what Weird Al isn't that bad of a guy.
He really isn't that bad!
