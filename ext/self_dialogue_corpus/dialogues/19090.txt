We're going to the James McMurtry concert next month.
What kind of music does he play?
Sort of country-folk, singer-songwriter stuff.
Where did you hear of him?
He's from Texas and we first heard him live there.
What is it you like about him?
He has really intelligent lyrics and an interesting storytelling style.
Who would you compare him to, for someone like me who's never heard of him?
He's part of that whole school of Texas singer-songwriters like Guy Clark and Robert Earl Keen, but maybe a little darker.
What's his latest album. I might want to check him out.
His latest is Complicated Game. Check out a couple of his videos on YouTube.
Any particular one you'd recommend?
How'm I Gonna Find You is a good one -- kind of funny, too.
James McMurtry -- the name is sort of familiar.
His dad is Larry McMurtry. He wrote The Last Picture Show and Lonesome Dove and a bunch of other books that were made into movies.
When is that concert again?
Next Month. The 14th
Where is it?
At the White Rock -- it's kind of a small venue, but the tickets are reasonable. Let me know if you want to go.
I'll look into it. Thanks.
