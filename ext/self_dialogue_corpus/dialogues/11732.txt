Hey, I saw an old rerun of the Dick Caat show on YouTube.
Yeah? Who was he interviewing?
George Harrison of the Beatles.
Nice. What was he like?
Not like anything I imagined.
What did you imagine?
I don't know. Some pompous, arrogant pop star who was self-centered and ignorant.
And what was he like?
He was a nice guy. A bit shy and quirky, but he didn't seem like a jerk.
A rare animal in the music industry! For sure!
