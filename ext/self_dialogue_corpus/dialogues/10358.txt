What was the best Lord of the Rings movie?
That's a nearly impossible question to answer.  They were all exceptional.
I'm with you.  The third probably had the best action.
Do you mean the big battle at the end at the gates of Mordor or the one outside the city?
Pick either one.  There were tons of good examples in that movie.
I always thought that Helms Deep from the second movie was my favorite.
That one definitely had a very intimate feel since the scale was grand, but centralized.
It helped that they were so outnumbered.
I'll have to watch the series again to give you the best answer.
Let's go watch the first movie right now!
