What is your favorite rock band?
I really like southern rock, like Lynyrd Sknyrd.
Skynyrd is a most awesome group.  What is your favorite song by them?
Most people like "Sweet Home Alabama", but I like "Freebird" the best.
Oh I love that song.  Freebird always makes me want to slow dance.
Listening to Freebird makes me want to wave my lighter in the air.
What album is Freebird on?
I know it is on Gold and Platinum.  That album has all their greatest hits.
Is it one CD or two?  Do you know?
Its a double CD set.  I have pretty much worn mine out!
