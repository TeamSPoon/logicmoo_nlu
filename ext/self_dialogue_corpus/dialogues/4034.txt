Did you see the movie Mystic River?
That's the one with Sean Penn and Kevin Bacon?
Yeah, that's the one.
I saw it. It was good.
I read the book, then when the movie came out I just had to see it.
Was it just like the book?
Almost word for word. When I read the book I could picture everything that was happening,
It was messed up how the two kids are the one's that killed his daughter.
I know right. He jumped the gun thinking that his friend killed her.
Yeah, that part was messed up.
