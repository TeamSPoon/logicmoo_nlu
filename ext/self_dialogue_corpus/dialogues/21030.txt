Have you seen Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 yet?
Yes, I saw it on opening night.
I'd like to see it sometime. What did you think?
It wasn't as good as the first one, but I still like it a lot.
I loved the first one.
Yeah, that was a great movie.
I just thought it was really fun and irreverent.
The special effects were great, too.
Amazing how they turned Chris Pratt from chubby sitcom goof to action star.
Yeah, he got pretty buff for that, too.
Totally, P90X, I think.
He was a great casting choice, though. Fit the role so well.
Marvel does excellent with casting.
I totally agree.
I think I'll watch the first Guardians of the Galaxy with my son then take him to see Vol. 2.
That's a good idea, I'm sure he would really enjoy both.
I can't wait to see the postcredits scene.
Those are always a treat.
Yeah, it will be interesting to see how they start trying Guardians into the larger MCU.
Well, I won't spoil anything, but you will see some of that in Vol. 2.
