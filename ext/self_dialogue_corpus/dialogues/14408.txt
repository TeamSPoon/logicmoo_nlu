Are you loving playoff time or what?
No, not really.  My team was put our first round.
Oh yeah, who's your team?
The Memphis Grizzlies.  Yours?
My team is the Warrior's
They are so stacked that it's unfair.
I would agree, but I love it.
I am sure you do.  You even got Matt Barnes from us.
That's right.  He was a welcome addition to the squad.
Yes, we miss him.  Do you play any basketball video games?
I sure do.  I am a 2K fanatic.
Oh wow, I am as well.
That's hilarious. I spent over $600 on VC for NBA2K.
Haha, my wife hates when the theme music comes on for NBA 2K
Do you use the Grizzlies on there?
Nope. Warriors, haha.
It's the only way to go.  They are dropping 3's all day.
As stated, it's unfair how great they are.
It's a great time to be a Warriors fan.
The Grizzlies will take them down again next season.
