You know in some of the older Disney movies, they reused a lot of the film?
Like what?
They reused the dance sequence from Sleeping Beauty in the Belle movie.
Beauty and The Beast?
Yep, they just covered it, but used the same film.
How did they do that?
Pre-Pixar, before they merged most of the Disney animation was done by hand.
Even stuff like the Lion King?
Yep. There were computers involved by then, but most was by hand.
Wow, that makes the movies even cooler.
