Hey, are you a big Disney fan?
I'd say so. Why do you ask?
I was just wondering. What's your favorite Disney movie?
Frozen all the way!
That's a good one. Who is your favorite character?
Olaf! Yours?
Olaf is pretty great, but I think my favorite is Kristoff.
Oh I love him. He's definitely better than Hans.
I can't believe how evil Hans was!
You are so right!
