What do you think about the Dwaye Allen's chances this season?
I don't know, he should be fine.
Yes, but he never really worked out in Baltimore.
True, but in New England he has Tom Brady throwing to him.
Yes, but Andrew Luck is also pretty good.
Yes, but only one of those guys is already guaranteed a spot in the Hall of Fame.
I will give you that, but what about Gronkowski?
What do you mean?
Well, if Gronk is healthy, won't he take all the catches.
He will get his share, but there is always room for more.
Even so, will there be resentment over salary?
Because the two have similar contracts, you mean?
Yes, that is what I'm asking.
Well, they are all professionals.
OK, what about the coaching.
Well no one knows what Bill is thinking.
I was referring to the Offensive Coordinator.
Oh, Josh McDaniels.     He will be fine.
So you see this as another Patriots victory.
Yes, that is my interpretation.
