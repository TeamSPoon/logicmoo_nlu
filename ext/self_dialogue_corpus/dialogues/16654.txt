Hey, I've heard that you like rap music ?
Yep, that is right.
Me too! What are you listening to these days ?
Kendrick Lamar. Have you heard his newest album DAMN ?
Oh, yeah ! I really like his song Humble.
Oh that is fire ! Did you know that it was produced by Mike Will Made It ?
No did not know that. But you can kinda guess, tho. The beat went hard.
Haha yes it did ! I really like DNA. Have you heard it ?
No I haven't ?
I it is really good. And the video is crazy.
As crazy is the Humble one ?
Haha not THAT crazy. But Don Cheadle and Kendrick trade argue using the lyrics of the song.
Oh wow that sound cool. I should watch it.
I also like the LOYALTY track from his album.
What is it about ?
It features Rihanna and they rap about the necessity of complete loyalty in a relationship.
Sound like a song for me !
He also uses his newest moniker.
Oh yeah, what is it ?
Kung Fu Kenny haha.
