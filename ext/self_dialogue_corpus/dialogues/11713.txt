Are you a Beatles fan?
I like a lot of their songs, but I don't think I know nearly enough to consider myself a fan.
I'm assuming you have Beatles 1 then?
Exactly.  I know their greatest hits.
Those are some of their best songs.  Though if you are counting their best, you should remember 'Norwegian Wood.'
I don't know that one.
It was written by John Lennon.
What is it about?
It's about a person's brief love with a stranger.
Wait, this sounds familiar.  I think George Harrison played the sitar for this song.
