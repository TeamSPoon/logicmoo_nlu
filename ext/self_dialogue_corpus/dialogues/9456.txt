Who is the best female rapper?
I'm not sure, I don't know a lot of female rappers. Maybe Nicki Minaj?
Nicki is good, but I don't think she's anywhere as good as Lil Kim or Missy Elliot.
Wow, I haven't heard those names in a while.
They might be older, but both of them have the rap chops that I don't think Nicki has.
Nicki can rap really fast though.
Yeah, but rapping fast doesn't mean everything.
I guess that's true.
The really important things are whether or not you are doing some unique and original, and I think Nicki is kind of basic.
Yeah, she kind of is.
