What do you think about Tegan and Sara?
I like some of their songs, but I'm not a huge fan or anything.
Me too. Did you know they sing the Everything is Awesome song on The Lego Movie?
What! I had no idea.
Me either. It sounds so much different than their other songs.
It's so surprising. I almost can't believe it.
They won an Academy Award for Best Original Song for it.
Wow, that's amazing.
What do you think of The Lonely Island? They starred on that song.
Now that I can expect. I like The Lonely Island for what it is, a funny twist on popular music.
Me too. Their song I'm On A Boat is so funny.
I can't believe they got T-Pain in that song.
Me either. His lyrics make it even funnier.
What do you think of Weird Al Yankovic?
I think he's clever, but I don't really like his songs.
I feel the same way.
Hasn't he been sued before for Copyright Infringement?
Hm. I don't know.
I was just wondering because it seems like he copies people's songs.
I wouldn't say that. He makes the songs his own by coming up with his own lyrics.
