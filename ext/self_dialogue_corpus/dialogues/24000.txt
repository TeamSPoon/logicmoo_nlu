Hey, do you want to watch Pirates of the Caribbean with me?
At the theatre?
No, I have it on DvD.
I don't know, who plays in that movie?
One of the stars is Orlando Bloom.
I don't like Orlando Bloom.
It also stars Keira Knightly.
I don't like her, either.
It also stars Johnny Depp.
Oh, I love Johnny Depp!
Yeah, so do I. So, do you want to watch it with me?
I don't know, what is it about?
It's about an evil pirate curse.
What does Johnny Depp have to do with that?
Johnny Depp plays Captain Jack Sparrow, an adventurous pirate.
Yeah, but what does that have to do with the curse?
It has everything to do with it.
Yeah, okay, but how?
Well, let's watch it and find out!
Fine, I'll watch it.
