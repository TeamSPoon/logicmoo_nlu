Just because I'm asian means I know about Chinese music?
You know what I mean bro.
I can only tell you what my parents know.
Sure that works.
So my parents listen to music from 30 years ago.
So they listen to traditional Chinese music?

What do you mean?
Don't get it confused with like ancient Chinese music, with the Gu qing, and the chanting.

Think of modern karaoke, to an orchestral background.
Huh. That's hard to imagine.

So most Chinese songs are love songs?
