How do they make a movie then come out with a prequel twenty years later?
What are you talking about?
I'm talking about Star Wars.
Oh yeah, I saw the three originals.
Those are the only three I've seen.
The ones after that are supposed to tell the story of what led up to those three.
Who starts a movie or a story backwards?
They made them movies just to make money off the franchise.
I like The Empire Strikes Back, it had a lot of action with Luke and Darth Vader.
Me too. I had a feeling all along that Darth Vader was Luke's father.
