Have I told you recently how much I love Lady Gaga?
What's your favorite song of hers?
Well I've always loved Eh, Eh (Nothing Else I can Say).
I loved the music video for that song, I'm surprised it wasn't more popular.
Me too. Have you heard her new album?
No, when did it come out?
Last year.
What's it called?
Joanne, it's so freaking good.
I'll have to check it out!
