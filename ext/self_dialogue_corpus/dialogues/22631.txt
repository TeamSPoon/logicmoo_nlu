Did you see what they're showing on LOGO this weekend?
I don't get that channel.
They have a weekly show where they drink alcohol and watch a movie. They call it "Cocktails & Classics"
My cousin calls that Sunday afternoon.
Anyways, they're showing Showgirls.
The one with that girl from Saved By The Bell??
Yep.  They were either scraping the bottom of the barrel or someone in that movie gave them a big check.
Among other things.
Will it be unedited?
I doubt it
They better use shot glasses then.
I don't think they do.  Why?
That is going to be one very short program.
Hahahahaha might make the movie better.
The only reason to watch that movie is for the nudity.  Who didn't grow up wondering what Jessie Spano looked like naked?
Anyone who watched Showgirls first
Is there any part of her body she doesn't show off?
Oh yeah.
What's that?
Her brain.
