What do you think of the new stuff by Lady Gaga?
I do not like the sort of added country feel to some of the songs.
The one about the mirror you mean?
Yes, it was not pop enough for her. She is a pop star not a country one.
I like the change of pace of her stuff.
It may be a change, but I like her older stuff.
What is her best song in your opinion?
I would have to say Poker Face.
Good dance song, I do not think it is her best.
I like that is had meaning, but was also just there, all pop and all happy.
