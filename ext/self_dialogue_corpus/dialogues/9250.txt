What's your favorite rock band of all time?
Like if I only had to listen to one rock band for the rest of my life?
Yea.
Probably Weezer.
Ahh, good choice.
Yea. I mean I've been listening to their music for like the past 15 years at least, and I still don't get tired of them.
Their songs are so good. Especially the early stuff from their Blue album.
I know right?! Say It Ain't So and Buddy Holly are my favorites from that album.
They're so catchy. I only wish that their later albums were as good.
Yea, the other albums were kind of hit or miss. There were a few good songs from every album, but I loved every single song from the Blue Album.
