I really like Twenty One Pilots.
I don't know much about them.
They're really good.  There are two guys in the band.
What kind of music is it?
It's hard to describe.  It's kind of alternative, but pop.  Sometimes they rap.
I don't really like rap music.
It's not rap music.  It's just sometimes they rap in it.
So, there is music, other lyrics and stuff in the songs?
Yes.  It's not rap music.
OK.  I'll listen to them and see if I like it.
