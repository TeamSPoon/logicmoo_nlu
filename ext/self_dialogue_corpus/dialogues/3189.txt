Hey man what's up.
Not much here.  What about you?
I'm OK.  So you been watching football lately?
I used to watch it.  My whole family watched it when I was growing up.
Oh yeah?  What was your team?
New York Jets.
Hey me too!  Did you grow up in New York?
Close.  Jersey.
How close to the city were you?
Very close...we lived not far from the Meadowlands.
Where they buried Jimmy Hoffa, right?
Yeah, right, right!  That is the story anyway.
Or was it the GW Bridge pilings?
I don't know man.
You go to any games?
Not too many, we grew up kind of poor.
Yeah yeah I hear that.
So anyway, you know, I have not watched football too much lately.
Oh yeah?  Why is that?
I don't know man.  Just not too into it these days.
