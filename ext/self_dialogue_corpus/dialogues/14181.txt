Hi there.
Hey.
Do you know about Lady Gaga?
Only a little bit.
Not really a big fan of hers?
No I wouldn't call myself a fan, but I know a few of her more popular songs.
Bad Romance is a really  big one from her.
Yeah that is one I've heard that is pretty catchy.
It got a lot of radio play.
It still does, I hear it from time to time on the radio.
