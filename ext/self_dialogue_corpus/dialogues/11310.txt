What is your favorite Beatles Album?
I like The White Album. It is so crazy.
I like Sargent Pepper. My favorite song is A Day in the Life
Yeah, that's a good one. Is that the one with Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds?
Yes. I also like the older songs, like I Wanna Hold Your Hand.
What about Twist and Shout? Wasn't that in Ferris Beuller?
That's right. It's too bad they had to break up.
I would say that they're one of the best bands ever.
Maybe. Definitely the best British band.
I agree.
