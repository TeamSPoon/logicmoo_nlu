Ugh...this is driving me crazy...
What? What are you doing?
I'm trying to make a mix from my favorite 90's bands and I'm on this Rob Thomas streak.
Rob Thomas? Do you mean Robbie Thomas?
No, he's the songwriter and vocalist for Matchbox 20
Oh man...I loved that music when I was growing up.
Right?
I really liked that song "Push"
That's his best known one with Matchbox, but he did a lot of other good ones too?
Wait, did he do "Everything you Want?"
No, that was Vertical Horizon, he did songs like "Bent" and "3am" that I really like.
So what is driving you crazy about it then?
I'm trying to find his song "Mad Season" and I can't seem to download it anywhere
I don't think I know that one
It was on the radio forever along with "Unwell", but maybe it has another name or something.
You know he was the vocalist for Smooth right?
Smooth! I totally forgot about that one! Who was it he did that song with?
I think it was Santaria or something like that...if I recall correctly.
No, your thinking of Sublime, Smooth is with Carlos Santana
Yes, love Santana's jams. If you haven't seen it, the live version of it is really good.
