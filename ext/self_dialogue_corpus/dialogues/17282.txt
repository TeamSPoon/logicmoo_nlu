Not to be a downer but I really hate classical music.
What makes you say that?
It's boring. It's doctor's office music.
Doctor's office music? What does that even mean?
It's the music you put on in a waiting room to keep people calm.
Oh, well yes people do use it for that but it's definitely not boring!
I've heard a lot of it. I think I can safely say "Bored!"
You've heard it, but have you really listened?
Well, yeah. What was I going to do, plug my ears?
No, I mean have you listened to it and actually paid attention to what's happening?
Not really I guess.
Ok, take this for example. Everyone's heard Moonlight Sonata right?
Yeah... I've probably heard it a million times.
Great, then it's a good example. It starts out all quiet and soft and kind of repetitive, right?
Yes. That "dun da da" thing keeps happening over and over.
But if you listen, underneath it keeps changing. That little bit of melody is floating on top of something that's always moving and shifting around.
Ok, but it's still not exciting. Floating isn't exciting.
Right, but if you keep listening it gets bigger. There's tension building, and all of a sudden instead of floating you have these surges of energy and sound!
Oh, when it gets all low and poundy?
Yeah! And then it relaxes for a second and then pounds again. Tension and release, over and over. That's not boring!
