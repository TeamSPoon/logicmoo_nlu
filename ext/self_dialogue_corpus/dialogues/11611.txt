Who's your favorite Beatle?
Oh, tough one. These days it's Paul.
Really? I had you pegged as a Lennon gal.
Yeah, I used to be growing up, but now I find Lennon too serious at times.
Ah, I love Lennon. He's my favorite.
He is great, don't get me wrong, but no one can touch Paul's melodies.
I think I read an interview with Bob Dylan once where he said Paul is the best melody writer of all time.
That's extremely high praise!
Yeah, it is, coming from one of the best lyricists of all time.
Yup! My full ranking is this Paul then George then John then Ringo.
