Do you remember that movie with Eliza Dushku in it about 15 years ago?
Was it the one where they were camping?  Pretty sure the name is Wrong Turn.
I remember now.  That was such a great movie.  I wished the sequels were as good as the original.
They never are.  The ending was my favorite part when they came back to the convenience store to rip down the map.
That was funny.  I was really sad when the boyfriend was hit with all the arrows.
That was upsetting.  He almost made it back to the truck, but the killers were just too good at hunting.
How about the part with the ranger station in the trees?  Would you have jumped out of it?
I would definitely have jumped because it was on fire.
I can tell you this, I did not want ot take a camping trip to the mountains anytime soon after seeing that movie.
Just don't take any unmarked roads and you'll be fine.
