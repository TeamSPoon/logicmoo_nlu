There used to be this reggae singer I really liked a few years ago. I can't remember his name.
Was it Shaggy?
No I remember him, it was someone else.
Then it must be Sean Paul?
Did he sing "Angel"?
I'm not sure, I think that may have been Shaggy.
Did he sing that one song "Give it Up to Me."
Yes he did!
What album was it from, do you remember?
The album was titled The Trinity I believe.
Oh okay. I love Reggae music.
It's so fun!
I know! My mom would actually let me play reggae in the car.
I remember when I was a senior in high school we went to Trinidad and I hear reggae music there.
I bet that was a fun experience.
Oh it definitely was. I'd love to go back again.
I'm surprised that reggae music isn't more popular.
I think a lot people classify it as rap. Which it isn't.
Right. I can see that.
Yes I think it's ridiculous though.
