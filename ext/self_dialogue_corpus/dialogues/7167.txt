I went this weekend with my kids to see Cars 3. They love it!
We wanted to go and see it but we didn't make it. Lighting McQueen is my son's favorite Disney character.
All my kids love him too.
Did you see it in 3D? How was it?
Yes we did. It was fantastic. We really enjoyed the animation, the effects and the plot of the movie.
What is it about this time around?
I don't want to give away the plot, but the message in this Car's movie is one that really will help children believe in themselves.
That's a good message for kids now a days.
Yes is it, and the best part is that the whole movie revolves around believing in one self. Which is amazing.
You can never go wrong with a Disney Pixar movie. They are the best. We will definitely be seeing this one next weekend.
