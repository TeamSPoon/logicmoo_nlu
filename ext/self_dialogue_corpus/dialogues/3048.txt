Who do you think will win the superbowl this year.
I hate to say it but the Patriots.
Those cheaters?
Yep. Tom Brady is still pretty good
And they have Gronkoski still too.
And that evil cheating coach Bill Bellichick
Tom Brady is 39 years old though
That might slow them down
I think the Falcons also have a chance though
I don't like Matt Ryan
Me either, but he's a great QB
Who else is good for the Falcons?
They have a new tight end
The rookie?
Yeah Eric Saubert. He's going to be good.
I hate to say it but I think Dallas might do well this year too
I love watching Dallas lose
Who is their QB?
Dakota Prescott so far
And a bunch of back ups
