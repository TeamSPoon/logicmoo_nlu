Have you ever seen Red Letter Media?
I don't know think so.. what's it about?
It's this guy who does reviews on Youtube.  One of the things he's most famous for it this several of his Star Wars movie reviews, including the Phantom Menace.
No, I haven't.
Oh, man, it is HILARIOUS!  I mean, he doesn't just nitpick things, but he offers a lot of really wise insight while pretending to be this deranged old guy.
Oh, man, it's sounds pretty funny.
It is.  You'll have to look it up.  I mean, he points out things like, there's no real protagonist in the movie.
Uh.. isn't that Anakin?
No, not really.  I mean, he doesn't show up until about the middle of the film, and pretty much affects the story only by accident.
Oh, yeah, I remember that.  He just hits a few buttons and the ship takes off on it's own.
