I just heard this band for the first time and I'm completely amazed by them.
Which band?
They're called Primus.
I've heard of them.  Their lead singer plays bass doesn't he?
He does.  His name is Les Claypool.
If I remember correctly, he's really good or something right?
I think a lot of people would say that he's really good at bass.
Yeah, I remember a song from them called Shake Hands with Beef.
That song is a pretty good example of why people think he's good at bass.
He's got that funky slap bass style.
He sure does, but he's also a really unique and creative song writer.
Why do you think he's unique?
Because the style of his songs are centered around the bass and use the percussion and guitar as a supporting cast.
There's other bands with lead singing bassists though.
But Primus handles the situation differently and the bass is the centerpiece.
How is it different?
For example, the bass will literally drive the music while the guitar will play something completely different and has an almost ambient sound.
That is different, most rock bands have the guitar playing a lot of chords.
He also plays an upright bass at times, which is incredibly unique for the genre.
I've definitely never seen a rock band using an upright bass.
