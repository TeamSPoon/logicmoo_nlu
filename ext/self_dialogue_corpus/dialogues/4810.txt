Hey, who is playing tonight?
I don't know why?
I feeling like going to a bar to watch a game.
Let's go.
Let me look up to see who's playing.
It's the Cardinals and Mets.
That sounds like a boring game.
Yeah but one beer will make it better.
That's true.
I saw the Mets last year.
Cool where?
In L.A..
Who did they play?
They played the angles.
Did the angles win?
Yes.
Was it a good game?
It was ok I guess.
Would you want to see them play again?
No, it was a sad game.
