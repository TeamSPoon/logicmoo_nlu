Did you see the movie The 300?
No.
Why not?
Because I don't like those types of movies.
What type of movies?
All those gladiator warrior type movies.
Why not?
Because that stuff is way before my time.
And?
And who cares about those old prehistoric, pre modern day era type flicks where men fought with shields and swords?
I like them, In my opinion The 300 was a good flick.
Man, that movie is almost three hours long.
What that mean?
It means who has time to spend almost 180 minutes looking at a movie screen?
Man you stupid.
Naw, just don't like long behind movies.
So anything over two hours and you won't watch?
Anything over 90 minutes it's a wrap for me.
That's lame.
Naw, three hours watching a movie is lame.
