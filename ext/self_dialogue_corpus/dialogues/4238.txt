Did you ever see Identity with John Cusack?
Oh my goodness that was a wonderful movie. I never saw the twist coming.
I don't think anyone did. They did such a great job of separating the characters.
I love movies where the main character has a split personality and thinks he's interacting with separate others.
Me too. John Cusack did a great job in 1408 also.
Oh that's the movie based on the Stephen King book right?
Yes it is. I have to say he did a really wonderful job of displaying fear in that movie.
That's one I haven't seen yet but I need to check it out.
It'll have you on the edge of your seat, trust me.
Yeah I believe you but Identity is one of my favorite suspense thrillers for sure.
