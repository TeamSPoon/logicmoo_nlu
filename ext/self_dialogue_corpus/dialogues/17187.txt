Have you ever had a bad experience at a concert?
Of course, I think everyone does sooner or later if you go to a lot of them.
What was a bad experience for you?
I went to see KMFDM. They are a very rowdy alternative rock band, and their mosh pits have a lot of shoving and hard physical stuff.
Did you get hurt in the mosh pit?
No, I was robbed intentionally I think.
What happened?
The crowd suddenly started shoving a lot, and then I felt someone shove me really hard, and I kind of stumbled, but didn't see who it was. Then I looked down and saw my shoulder bag was missing- but just the purse part. The fabric straps were still on my shoulders. They held onto the purse and then shoved me really hard to break my purse off.
Oh how horrible. What did you do?
I borrowed a flashlight from security, checked the floor, and checked again when the lights came on, and never found it.
What did you lose in your purse?
The worse part was my car keys. I had to call someone to come get me from an hour away, and go back the next day and get the car. I lost $100 and my drivers license.
I bet you were mad.
I was furious, but also scared. They had my address on my license and my house keys on the keychain, so I didn't sleep when I got home and had to get both the door locks changed at my house.
Did you enjoy anything about the concert?
Not really- I usually liked their songs, but it was just too loud, the mosh pit was too mean, it was too smoky.
So did you ever go see that band again?
No, because I knew that I would always keep remembering that, and it would ruin another show.
I think I would have skipped seeing that band again too.
It did teach me a good lesson- leave my purse in the trunk, and wear pockets to put my keys in.
