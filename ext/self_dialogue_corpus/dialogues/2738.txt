What did you do on your trip to San Francisco?
Actually I ended up going to a 49ers games.
You did? Was it fun?
Tons! I hadn't been to a football game in ages.
Who was playing?
It was the 49ers vs the Seahawks.
That sounds like it could've been an exciting game.
It was! I got really into it.
Who won in the end?
The 49ers. It was great.
I'm glad it was the team you wanted!
Me too.
It's been a long time since I've seen a game in person.
We should go sometime! I bet we can get tickets to a Brancos game sometime.
Hmm. Yeah, that could be fun.
Let me look it up and see when we could get tickets.
How's it look?
There are some affordable tickets for a game in two weeks.
Great! Let's go.
I'll buy them now!
