Do you like Taylor Swift?
I'm not the biggest fan. She's a bit too pleasant sounding for my taste.
I could see that. She is really popular in younger audiences.
I respect the fact that she writes some of her own music, though.
Yeah, she also really plays the guitar well.
True. I do catch myself singing along to "Bad Blood" sometimes.
It's hard not to. The chorus to that song is awesome.
I don't really know many of her other songs. They blur together for me.
I'm sure you've heard "Shake It Off". I've been listening to that a lot lately.
Oh yeah. That one was all over the radio.
