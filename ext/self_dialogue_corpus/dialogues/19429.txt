Did you ever listen to Sugarland?
The old country band? Of course!
I really miss them. They were so good.
Yeah, Baby Girl is one of my favorite songs of all time.
Me too! I listened to it a lot in high school.
Fly Away is also good.
I haven't heard Fly Away. What album is it on?
It's on Twice the Speed of Life.
I don't remember that album.
It came out in 2004. I think it was their second album.
Oh, right. Is that the album with Tennessee and Time, Time, Time.
Yes, it is. Both of those are great songs as well.
I wonder what the band members are doing now.
I think Christian Bush and Jennifer Nettles each have solo projects.
Oh I think you're right. It seems like they did better together though!
I agree. I think Love On the Inside is my favorite Sugarland album.
Oh, what songs are on that?
Already Gone and It Happens are both on Love On the Inside.
Oh is Already Gone the song about growing up that is kind of sad?
That is the one. It is great though.
