Who's your favorite band of all time?
The only band that matters.
No, multiple bands can matter. Who is your favorite?
Ha! "The only band that matters" is another name for The Clash.
I see, I see. What's the deal with The Clash.
They were labeled as "punk," but in my opinion, they only put out one true punk album, the rest of the stuff isn't neatly categorized.
Why is it hard to categorize?
It spanned so many genres: rockabilly, soul, punk, rock, pop, reggae, dub, electronic, etc.
Yeah, that certainly sounds much more complicated than simply punk.
It's a shame that some people don't check them out because they don't like punk.
I never thought of that. How labels influence what bands get listened to.
Right, labels are useful and harmful in all aspects of life, but especially music.
Agreed. Kendrick Lamar, to some, is a rapper from the hood, but that's super simplistic, he's also the best storyteller in the past thirty years.
That's a bold claim, but I get what you're saying, genre labels can limit and define.
Back to The Clash, they're your favorite, so probably a difficult question, but what is their seminal album.
London Calling is not just their seminal album. It's the best album of all time.
Another huge claim from you. Why do you think this?
It's self-assured, it's experimental, it's got a meaningful worldview, and it's still fresh almost thirty years later.
Those are some pretty good criteria. What's the catchiest song on London Calling.
Hmmm...Train in Vain for sure, that's a classic pop rock song.
