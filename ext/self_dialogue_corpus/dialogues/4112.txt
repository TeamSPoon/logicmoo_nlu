Have you seen Blue Velvet?
Of course I've seen it, I love David Lynch.
I figured you would've. Really neat that Kyle McLaughlin and Laura Dern are in it, since they do so much with Lynch.
Yeah two of his standby actors
Where would you rank it among Lynch films?
Near the top honestly, I'm partial towards The Elephant Man and Fire Walk with me since I love Twin Peaks so much, but it would be right behind those two.
My list would best be the same, but Blue Velvet would be first and those other two second and third.
Did you know Blue Velvet had really mixed reviews?
I didn't, but it doesn't surprise me. Lynch is unique enough that not everyone will get it so to speak.
Yeah I know Ebert for example absolutely hated it, his loss I say!
