Hey Shayne what's going on with you today?
I'm just hanging at my pops watching some football tape, you wanna come over?
Oh definitely man, you watching any teams in particular?
You know I have to catch my Dolphins man!
Oh right you are a Florida boy before a California boy, even though you live in California.
I can't root for a team just because I like them?
Of course you can, it is just weird to like a team that doesn't represent the place you live.
I honestly just used to watch Dan Marino all the time and that inspired me to watch the modern era.
That is cool, I completely understand having legends inspire.
It is the same with any sport, I still follow the Bulls because of Jordan.
Good point, let's watch some Dolphins and classic Titans tape.
You mean the Tennessee Titans?
Oh definitely man, I am from California but I always loved the McNair and George combination!
Eddie George was  a quick and savage monster.
I agree man, in his hay day he was an absolute beast.
And you remember McNair was incredible in NFL Blitz?
That was the best game of all time!
I have an old PlayStation, we can actually play it!
Football and Blitz, classic day.
It'll be fun, see you soon.
