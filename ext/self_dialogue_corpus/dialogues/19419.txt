Are you a big fan of music festivals?
Well, it depends on the festival.
Really?  What are the deciding factors.
I am a bit older, so I like festivals that are easier to access.
Oh I understand.
I also am over camping at music festivals.
What's your favorite type of music to see at a festival?
I'd have to say super jams.
What in the world is a super jam?
It is a general collective of musicians that offer a one time performance.
Oh that's really cool.
Indeed it is.  There are usually artists from several different genres.
Do they practice?
Sometimes, the artists are able to practice and other times, they play standards that everyone knows.
Where can I catch a superjam?
I saw my first one at Bonnaroo in 2002, but they are everywhere now.
Do they ever add rappers?
Yes, in fact Chance the Rapper was a part of this year's super jam.
That's incredible.
It sure is.  Let's go hit up a super jam now.
