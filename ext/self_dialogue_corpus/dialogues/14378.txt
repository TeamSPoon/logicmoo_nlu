Hey what about the Warriors this year?
What do you mean?
Do you think the Warriors will win the Championship?
No way.
Why is that?
Because they don't play well.
But they have so many stars.
Name one.
Stephen Curry is a star player.
But he is too short.
But he is still effective in scoring points.
How many points does he usually score?
I'm not sure, around 30 per game.
That is a lot of points.
Ya, and he is not the only star.
Wow, so I think the Warriors are good.
Do you think they will win the Championship?
Ya I think they will.
Do you like their jersey colors?
Ya their colors are good.
