What's that new Pirates of the Caribbean movie called?
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell no Tales.
Right, that's the one. We should go see it.
Sure. I love some Johnny Depp.
I hope he keeps making more Pirates of the Caribbean movies. They're so unique.
I enjoy the world and the lore. Of course it doesn't hurt that Johnny Depp is the perfect Jack Sparrow.
I wish they would bring back Orlando Bloom to play Will Turner and Keira Knightley to play Elizabeth Turner.
They're in the new movie from what I'm told.
Are you serious?
Yeah. They are there but only at the end for a little bit.
