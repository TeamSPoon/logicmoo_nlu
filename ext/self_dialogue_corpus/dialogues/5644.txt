Have you seen any good Disney movies lately?
Yeah I saw Pirates of the Caribbean.
I love Johnny Depp in that movie.
He is really a great pirate in that movie.
I also love Kiera Knightley in that movie.
She is also very good.
What did you think of Orlando Bloom's character?
He was also decent in it.
I havent seen the others but I would like to.
Same.
