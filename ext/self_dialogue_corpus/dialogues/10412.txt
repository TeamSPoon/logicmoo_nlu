Hey, how's it going?
I'm doing great how about you?
I'm doing really good. Went to an awesome concert last night!
Oh yeah? Who'd you see?
My favorite band in the world, Duran Duran.
Oh I like them, did they do a lot of their older stuff?
About half new stuff and half older stuff. They really put on a great show!
That's awesome. Who was their opening act?
Do you remember Chic, from the seventies?
Yeah they're pretty groovy!
They put on a fantastic show as well!
Nice! Where did you see them?
They were at the Greek Theatre in Berkeley, it's a nice venue.
Did you have good seats?
Not really, we were in the nosebleed section.
Aww that's too bad.
Yeah but they sounded terrific.
I'm so glad you had a good time.
Me too, I love those guys!
It was nice talking to you. Take care.
