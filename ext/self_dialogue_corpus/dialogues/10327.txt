Do you remember Roy Scheider?
Wow, I haven't thought of him in years.
Well I saw a great action movie that he did back in the 70's.
What was it?
It was called Sorcerer.
What was the plot?
Scheider had to run a truckload of nitroglycerine through a South American jungle.
That sounds tense.
It was very tense and the cinematography was great.
I am going to see if I can rent that one tonight from iTunes.
