Have you seen Les Miserables?
You mean the one with Hugh Jackman?
Yes, that's the one. It also starred Russell Crowe and Anne Hathaway.
I didn't see it. Was it any good?
It was fantastic but then again I really like musicals.
It was a musical? I didn't know Hugh Jackman or Russell Crowe could sing.
I didn't either until I saw the movie. Apparently Hugh Jackman was on Broadway in his early career.
What about Russell Crow? I just can't imagine him singing.
There was a little bit of controversy over his singing. You either loved it or hated it.
What did you think about it?
I think that he did a great job! His character was Javert who was all about following the rules.
What do you mean? Was he like a judge or something?
No, he was like a policeman. He was very unhappy and legalistic and his voice was strained but that just made it seem authentic.
Oh, you mean because he was an uptight kind of guy.
Exactly! He was trying to catch Hugh Jackman's character because he thought a man could never change and once a criminal he would always be a criminal.
What was the character's name that Hugh Jackman played?
Jean Val Jean was the name of the character. He was a criminal but he had been shown mercy by a priest and had really become a new person.
So Javert had no mercy or compassion and just hunted criminals to bring them to justice?
Yes, and in the end he had so much bitterness and hatred inside that he actually committed suicide.
Wow! That's really sad. It's too bad no one had shown him mercy.
