Are there any songs you've completely memorized?
Sure, I love music, and my favorite songs I listen to over and over.
But I'm talking about perfect memorization, where you could sing it word for word perfectly.
Yeah, there are a few.
What's one of them.
Well, this is a little embarrassing...
Aw, don't be shy! I won't laugh.
"The Humpty Dance", but Humpty Hump and the Electric Underground.
Haha, what??
You said you wouldn't laugh!
OK, I couldn't help it. But why do you know all the words to that song, of all songs?
It's my go-to Karaoke song.
Why would you pick that one?
Well, it's got goofy, funny lyrics, so people have fun listening to me sing it.
That makes sense, actually.
I mean, I have a terrible voice, so no one wants to listen to me sing some normally beautiful song badly.
Yeah, choosing music where you don't actually have to be good at singing is a smart strategy.
It's worked well for me over the years.
And it explains why you know all the words to the Humpty Dance!
Precisely. Maybe I'll sing it for you sometime.
