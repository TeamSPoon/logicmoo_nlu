Any news on Big Ben Rothensberger?
Are you talking about the fourth of July accident.
Oh yes i did hear about that.
It was not true he did not blow up his fingers.
I find it hard to believe anyone would actually believe that story.
Some people did believe it.
The Steelers have won 6 super bowls correct
Yes they won four in the 70s and 80s durning the reign of the Steel curtain and 2 after that.
Who was your favorite player of all times
I would say Terry Bradshaw is one of my all time favorites.
He was pretty awsome durning his time.
He was playing durning the time of the Steel curtain.
As far as now i like Ben Rothinsberger
He is a great quarter back with a wonderful arm and he is fast for his size.
He is tall for a quarte back and he can take a hit better then most.
yes he can take a hit and he can run that ball if he needs to.
Wonder if we could make a game this year.
i would not mind seeing a preseason game. They are cheaper and less crowded.
That is a good idea.
Lets look into it today.
