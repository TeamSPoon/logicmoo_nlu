Do you like those old Do-wop songs?
What is do-wop?
Like, stuff from before the late sixties.
I do not know, like what?
Like Chuck Berry stuff.
What does he sing.
Johnny Be Good.
I have heard a lot of people sing that one.
Yes, John Meyer does a pretty good cover of it.
I think I heard that one blues guy sing it too, that always is on commercials.
B.B King?
Yes, he did it well.
He took after the Big Whopper.
Who is that?
That is the who really got all the do-wop stuff started.
I thought it was more stuff like Earth Angel.
Yes, but he started what they built on.
What are some other good ones of that genre?
I like the Platters and, The Great Pretender.
I love those slow and sort of sad song.
