If you arrange the Beatles first names by alphabet what order would it be?
That is not hard to do. It would be G J R and P.
G for George J for John R for Ringo and P for Paul right?
Yeah. Now can you put their the last names in alphabetical order?
I don't know all their last names so no I couldn't.
It would be H L M and .
H for Harrison, L for Lennon, M for McCarthy and S for Starr right?
Yeah. Hey that was pretty good.
I more of a fan of the Beatles music than of their names.
You up for playing some Beatle music trivia?
