What's you favorite genre of movie?
I like dramas and science fiction, why?
Out of science fiction, what are your favorite films?
Well, Star Wars and Dune are high on my list.
Got it. Do you like Arthur C. Clarke?
As in..
As in 2001 the Space Odyssey.
Yes definitely!
Its my favorite. Such a game-changer in the genre.
What's so special about it?
The scenes, direction, art, story, and a computer gone so wrong.
That HAL computer.
Right.  That was a unique picture of the future that the director had.
The director and writer were both ahead of the times.
They both were definitely visionaries.
Did you see the sequel?
You mean 2010?
I think thats the one.
It wasnt as good.  I read that one, and its sequel.
I can see you're a big fan.
