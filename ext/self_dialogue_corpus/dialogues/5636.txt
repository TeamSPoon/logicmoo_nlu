Who is your favorite character in Guardians of the Galaxy 2?
Definitely Baby Groot.
He's mine, too. I think he;s so cute.
I know. I loved the opening of the movie when he was dancing around.
My favorite part was the pushing buttons scene.
That was really funny.
I didn't like it in the ending credits when they showed him as a teenager.
I didn't watch the credits.
Well, he was a teenager and wasn't' cute anymore.
Too bad. I was hoping he would still be Baby Groot if they make another sequel.
