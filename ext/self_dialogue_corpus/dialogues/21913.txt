Have you seen the preview for the new Transformers movie?
No, does it look good.
I am not a huge Mark Wahlberg fan but it looks okay.
Is Optimus Prime in it, I heard he maybe wasn't?
Yeah, he is in the trailer so I think so.
I hope so, how would you make a Transformers movie without him?
Yeah, that would be crazy.
I know.
It looked okay, in the preview Optimus says he is no longer protecting the planet.
I see, so he is turning on us.
I guess, but  you know how trailers are.
I know, sometimes they give you the best parts in the trailer.
I know, I hate that.
me too.
Hopefully, that is not the case with this because it is really going to be bad otherwise.
I don't know if I like Mark Wahlberg in these movies.
Me either, I'm not sure I like Mark Wahlberg movies in general.
Yeah, me either.
He just doesn't appeal to me.
I can see that, I'm not sure about him.
