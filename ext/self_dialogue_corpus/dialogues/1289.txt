So who do you think is going to the Super Bowl this year?
Anyone but the Patriots, I hope!
Me too! I'm sick to death of them.
Yeah, plus they cheat constantly and lie about everything.
I'd like to see some new teams get there.
I don't know. Look at the last two NEW teams. Panthers and Falcons. Panthers were awful and Falcons were worse.
That's true but the Falcons played a great first half.
Yes, but look at the second half. That was the worst meltdown we've ever seen in a Super Bowl.
How about the Cowboys? They should stand a chance.
They have a serious chance but I hope not. I can't stand them.
But they're America's team!!
Only in their heads.
Okay, how about the Redskins?
I like the Washington Redskins. I like Kirk Cousins and I'd like to see him do well.
I'm not much of a Redskins fan.
I like the NY Giants better. I like Eli Manning and a few of the other players.
Eli's pretty good. He might have another SB win in him.
I hope so. I'm partial to the Mannings.
I think Houston might have a good chance.
I agree with you. They had a monster defense last year. It will only be better with JJ Watt coming back.
