Hey did you take your kids to see the new Beauty and the Beast.
You mean the new one staring Emma Watson as Bella
Yes   My kids and i loved it,
Yes we went and saw it i thought Dan Stevens did a wonderful job the his Beast character.
I agree but i did miss Angela Lansbury as Ms Potts i always loved her voice.
Yes Emma Thompson played Ms Potts on this one but Angela Lansburys voice was much better
Do you recall who directed this Beauty and the Beast movie
Bill Condon directed this one i think he did an excellant job with the whole movie and cast.
I agree it has to be hard to work with live actors and do the computer generated stuff to.
He probably has the whole movie envisioned in his head and wantes everything a certain way.
yes your probably right but can you imagine how had it must be to get all your ideas out and have others understand it well enugh to act it out perfectly.
I imagine its diffacult and frustrating   Guess thats why were are not actors or directors.
Do you know of any other movies he has directed?
I know he did Mr Holmes and i think he directed some of the Twilight films.
I thought he did more i just cant think of any of the movies
He also did some writing of movies to
Yes he wrote and directed Gods and Monsters and Dreamgirls.
He also wote the screenplay for Chicago.
Other then the last 2 Twilight movies he directed i must say i think Beauty and the Beast is one of his top movies
I agree i loved it and so did both of my kids.
