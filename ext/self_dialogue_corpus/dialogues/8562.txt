Lady Gaga is such a fantastic musician!
What instruments does she play?
She plays plenty! I have definitely seen her play guitar and piano before.
She played those during her Super Bowl halftime performance, didn't she?
She did! Wasn't that a phenomenal show?
It really was! My favorite part was when she dropped down from the top of the stadium.
I loved that part too. She must have had a big stunt team help her with that.
She has always done interesting performances and the halftime show was no different.
I saw her perform David Bowie songs at the Grammy's too. Those were really cool!
She did a great job with that too. I loved that she had hair just like Bowie during the performance.
