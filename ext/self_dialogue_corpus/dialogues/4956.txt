How do you think the Dodgers are going to do this year?
It's hard to say, I guess it depends on how many injuries they have.
Yeah, I know what you mean. For what, about four years now by the time they get to the play offs they're pretty beat up.
It's pretty discouraging, they win their division every year and then they fizzile in the play offs.
I know right, they kind of remind me of the Atlanta Braves in the 90's. They just couldn't quite win the big one.
They had a heck of a team back then though.
Yeah, with Maddux, Glavine, and Smoltz, that was quite a pitching staff.
It was. Smoltz was pretty unbelievable after he got injured and came back as a relief pitcher.
It was like he had two careers. I wonder if he'll make it to the hall of fame.
I dunno. There's a lot of good players who don't get into the hall.
I think it's all a lot of political B.S.
Could be. But as long as Barry Bonds doesn't get in, I'm good with that.
Yeah, he was just such an incredible jerk.
Not to mention the thing with the steroids.
Yeah, one year he was thin, and then the next year he shows up with an extra 30 pounds of muscle.
There is no way he wasn't taking steroids. Him and a lot of other players.
Look how long it took Piazza to get in to the hall, and he wasn't even suspected of using steroids.
Yep. Just because he played during that era, he was automatically assumed to be guilty.
I was really broken up when the Dodgers traded him. I think he got the royal shaft.
He did. The Dodgers can be jerks, and they can't win the World Series, and yet we root for them every year.
