If you want to watch a great movie, watch Shoot 'em Up.
Never heard of it.
Clive Owen is in it.
I like that actor.
Yes, his movies are almost always good.
Who else is in it?
Paul Giamatti.
Let me guess, he's a bad guy, right?
Of course, isn't he almost always?
Yes. Well I like both of them, so I'll have to rent it.
