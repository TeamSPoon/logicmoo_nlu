Did you know Harrison Ford got paid just over 10K for the original Star Wars?
No way. Well, he wasn't really that well known back then
Nope. Star wars helped his career greatly. But still only a 100 a week was what he was paid
That's still good money even today's standards. That's like 4 thousand bucks a month. Well over middle class income.
yeah, and adjusted for inflation, it's over $39K today.
So wait, adjusted for inflation, he was paid close to $16K a month? That's a lot.
yep. And the last movie, the force awakens goes over $1 billion, Ford will make over 34 million from that
Sometimes I wonder if actors are paid way too much
How come?
No one deserves to get paid 34 million for being in a movie that's 2 hours long, at least if you ask me. Meanwhile school teachers barely make their bills. It's not fair.
