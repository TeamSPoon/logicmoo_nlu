So who is the best QB in the league?
Man, tough decision.  Tons of good ones to choose from.
You must have a favorite though.
Well, I'll have to go with Tom Brady.
I said best though.
I know you did.  I'd still go with Tom Brady.
The guy is like 40 years old now.
But he's still winning Super Bowls.  He would have been MVP last year if he had played all year.
I'm not saying he's not a great QB, but not sure he'd be my pick.
Alright then, who would you take?
I would probably go with Aaron Rodgers.
You could make an argument for him.
I don't really need to make an argument.  He's probably the most talented QB in the NFL.
His arm strength and accuracy is good no doubt.
He basically beat the Cowboys on his own.
If that's the condition you use, why not go Brady though?
Because Brady's talent seems to be mostly in his head, not his body.
That's a really dumb argument.
All I'm saying is if I'm choosing a QB, I'll go with Rodgers.
And me Brady.
