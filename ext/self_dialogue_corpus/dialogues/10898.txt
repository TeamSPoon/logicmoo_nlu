I love the Fast and Furious original.
Its the best one.
They were so young looking.
It was so cool to see it for the first time.
The ending was awesome.
That old muscle car was powerful.
It did a wheelie off the line.
I liked that he didnt get caught.
The cop let him go.
He risked his job for his friend.
