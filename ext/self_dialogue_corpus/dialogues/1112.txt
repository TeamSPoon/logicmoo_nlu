Who is your favorite NFL team?
I like the Detroit Lions!
Oh man that sucks to be you!
Yeah they are not so good right now.
They did have one of the greatest running backs of all time though.
Yeah Barry Sanders was amazing, who is your team?
I like the Green Bay Packers.
Haha so you're a cheese head then.
Yeah, definitely!  I bleed cheese.
Don't remind me of the Aaron Rodgers hail mary from last season.
I could never forget that, I didn't want to bring it up.
Thanks for that, haha.
How do you think the Lions will do this year?
I am hoping they make it back into the playoffs again.
I think they should, Matthew Stafford is a great quarterback.
He just needs help from the Offensive line and they did upgrade that in the off season.
Yeah hopefully they do well!
Indeed, there could be some exciting games.
Well it was nice talking to you!
Take it easy and go Lions!
