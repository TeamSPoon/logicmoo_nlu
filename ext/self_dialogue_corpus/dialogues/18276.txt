So it seems that boy bands are making a comeback.
Really? I hadn't heard that.
Ya, but there is nothing like the classic ones of the late nineties.
I know. I grew up in that era and loved them.
Who was your favorite?
I was an odd one out and really loved 98 degrees.
That is strange. Most people were into N'SYNC or The Backstreet Boys.
Ya, like I liked them, but they weren't my favorite.
Which one of the two did you like better.
I would say The Backstreet Boys.
I liked N'SYNC better, but I thought that The Backstreet Boys had better songs.
Ya, I love the song Quit Playing Games With My Heart.
That's a good one. My favorite is Larger Than Life.
What was your favorite N'SYNC song?
I like Tearin Up My Heart.
My favorite is God Must of Spent a Little More Time on You.
Ya thats a sweet one. I see that The Backstreet Boys are actually performing together again.
Ya I would really like to go. It would be like time traveling.
Ya, nothing like the good old boy bands of back in the day.
Totally agree.
