Can you help me study for music?
Sure, which class?
Renaissance music history.
Oh, lordy, that's a tough one.
Yeah, I really need studying advice.
What's the test on, specifically?
Well, it's a listening test.
Wow, those are rough.
Really?
Yeah, know how everyone thinks they all sound the same?
Yeah, haha.
Well, it's true. My school got rid of comprehensive music history tests because no one could pass the listening exam.
So how do I do it?
First off, it's only on a few composers, right?
Yes.
Listen for the language.
How so?
If it's in Latin it's a mass. If it's Italian it's Monteverdi.If it's French...
Got it, listen to the lyrics.
Yup, it's not so bad.
