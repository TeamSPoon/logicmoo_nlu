Did you like the comedy in Disney's Aladdin film?
Yeah I did.
Me too, funny right?  Robin Williams was on fire.
He did a solid job.
In an unexpected way.
They did a good thing casting him.
I still love the song A Whole New World.
A friend's daughter sang it at school.
Was there an Aladdin 2 film made?
I don't know but I'll find out.
