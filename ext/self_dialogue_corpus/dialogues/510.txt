The packers have to be looking for a new QB soon
Why would you think that?
Rodgers is getting up there in age
No I think he is playing just like he should be
Yeah but you always have to look to the future
They were just fine when Favre exited
But can they really hit it on the head with 3 QBs in a row?
They draft very well.
So you think they already drafted their guy?
No I think they will address it in a few years.
Do you think theyll have him sit like they did with Rodgers and Favre?
It really could go either way, like what happened with the Colts.
I think that was pure luck, no pun intended
Yeah they did get lucky but at the same time had to sit through a dreadful season
That doesnt seem to happen in Green Bay
It did when they Had Scott Tolzien starting
Forgot about that year
Yeah so they could be looking.
They seem to be in it every year though
Thats because of the depth the franchise has.
