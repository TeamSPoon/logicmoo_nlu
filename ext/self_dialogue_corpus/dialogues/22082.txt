Did you ever see Pan's Labrynth?
No. I don't go for subtitled movies.
I generally don't either, but this one is a must see.
Anyone I know in it?
I don't think so.
Who was the director.
Guillermo DelTorro
That guy is pretty good.
Yeah, I think he had a hand in the Hobbit Trillogy.
Why did they make that a trillogy.
I don't know. It did seem weird.
Yeah, they added all kinds of stuff that wasn't in the book.
It's a shame. The Hobbit is one of my favorites.
Mine too.
Read it as a kid and was hooked.
Yeah, I had higher expectations for the movies.
Movies made out of books are usually like that.
I thought they did a great job with The Lord of the Rings.
Agreed, but three books, three movies...
True.
