Hey what movies have you seen recently?
I saw Alien Covenant last weekend.
Oh I saw that too! I'm very interested to know what you thought.
It was "meh", I was pretty disappointed, although it did have its moments.
How so?
Well there were some interesting concepts and Michael Fassbender is excellent.
I see.
And it was also great to see the xenomorph in action again.
I agree.
But ultimately I think it was a tonal mess and all over the map.
Yeah I felt the same way...it seemed like it wanted to be two movies at once.
Yes, and that was very distracting and irritating.
I personally preferred Prometheus.
Me too, although I think they are "overthinking" this whole franchise in general.
Yes I agree, they need to keep it simple.
Exactly, why all of this mythology? It's getting way too convoluted.
They need to just stick to what they know best- straight up action or horror.
Exactly.
I wish they would let the District 9 director make his Alien 5 instead.
Yes I would be much more interested in seeing that.
