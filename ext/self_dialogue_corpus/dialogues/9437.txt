Do you know the rapper Future?
Yeah, hes one of the best rappers of all time.
He just came out with that hit Mask Off.
I love that song, its so catchy.
Have you heard any other new rap songs by him?
Yeah, there's one called Draco that is really good.
I'll have to listen to it, now that you mentioned it.
It's definitely worth it, I've replayed it about 100 times by now.
Haha, sounds like a great song then.
For sure, I can't get enough of it.
