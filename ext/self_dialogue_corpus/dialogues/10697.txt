What did you think of the 3rd Fast & Furious movie?
I had mixed feelings about that one, I mean none of the original characters and some random guy as lead.
Yeah I get what you mean, but it was still pretty cool.
Yeah especially when Han was showing off why he drifts and the girl passes him her phone number.
I was thinking the same thing. What did you think about Twink's ride.
The green Hulk mobile?
Yeah, I though it was pretty sweet.
You also think tires are free don't you?
Well obviously someone liked it or it wouldn't be in the movie.
Obviously they only liked it enough to have it in like 2 scenes for comic relief.
