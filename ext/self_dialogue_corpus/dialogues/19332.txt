Led Zeppelin was a really good band.
Yea when I was in high school I listed to them all the time.
They had some good songs, Stairway to Heaven for one.
Good musicians too.
Yea Robert Plant, John Bonham, Jimmy  Page and Jon Paul Jones.
I saw them in 1973 at Madison Square Garden.
Wow, I never got to see them, what did they play , do you remember.
Haha, it is sort of a fog but I remember they played a lot of their hits.
I like the song Whole Lotta Love and also Immigrant Song.
Yea they were great!
Did you know that Jimmy Page is 72?
Wow time flies.
Yes  but he has a girlfriend that is 26!
26???? Probably after his fortune.
I would think that.
They have had so many hits and people still love them today.
Yes so the money keeps rolling in.
Maybe they should do a reunion tour.
Are they all still alive?
I am not sure.
