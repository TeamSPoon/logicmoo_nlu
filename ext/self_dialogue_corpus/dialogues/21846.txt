Have you seen any good comedies lately?
A couple of weeks ago I saw "Yes Man" again with my wife. Hilarious!
Oh, yeah. That movie is very good.
But other than that I haven't liked any of the comedy movies that have been put out lately.
Yeah. I've had a really hard time finding a good one.
They are all so rude and immoral that I don't even laugh once.
Happens to me to.
You know, Jim Carrey should do some more movies like his old ones: "Liar Liar", "The Mask".
He should. But I heard that right now he is not so much into acting, but in other projects in his life.
Really? That's strange to hear.
Well, people want to mix things up. He wants to experiment with new things.
But was he still going to be in the movie industry?
Yes. He was trying directing, producing and that kind of stuff, if I remember correctly.
Well, we should see the movies he directs or produces. Maybe they'll be funny.
I don't know if they are going to be strictly comedies. You know he has experimented a lot with dramas too.
That's right. Well we'll have to wait and read about the movies he'll be participating in then.
Mean while, we'll have to re-watch any of his old ones.
That's right. My wife and I laughed just as hard as the first time with "Yes Man".
Maybe I'll see "Dumb and Dumber".
Classic. One of these days I'll probably watch it again too.
