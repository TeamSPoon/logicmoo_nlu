I Prevail is quickly becoming one of my favorite bands.
Oh, I like them too. Have you heard their remake of Blank Space?
I love that song! It's far better than the original.
They have another recent song, My Heart I surrender, that is awesome too. So moving but still hard rock.
I haven't heard that one. What other bands do you listen to?
I like Disturbed as well.
I'm not a big Disturbed, but their remake of the Sound of Silence was amazing. I didn't realize his voice was that amazing.
Oh I know. That song is so much different than anything they've put out in the past.
I'll always be a fan of Breaking Benjamin and Shinedown.
I like both of them too. I love I'll Follow You by Shinedown. I listen to it everyday.
