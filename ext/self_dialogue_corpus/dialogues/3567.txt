why do you even like horror movies?
its kinda like an emotional roller coaster
i guess thats why i dont like horror.
maybe so
it all seems so pointless for me.
yeah, you know whats going to happen.
its so repetitive and boring
its about the thrill
thats what i dont like i suppose
you want real art.
