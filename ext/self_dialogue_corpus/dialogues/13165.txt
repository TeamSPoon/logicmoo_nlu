Do you want to watch Return of the Jedi tonight?
Sure, I love that movie!
I think it's a great ending to the original Star Wars trilogy.
What's your favorite part?
I think my favorite is when Leia tells Han that Luke is her brother.
My favorite is when Luke defeats the Emperor.
And the Ewoks are so cute!
Yeah, I'm sorry they changed the ending music! I miss the Ewok song.
It was great to see a happy ending for everyone, and to see Darth Vader get redeemed.
Yeah, after watching the prequels, that was really good to see!
