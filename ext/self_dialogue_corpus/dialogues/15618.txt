What British band do you think more Americans should be listening to?
For sure The Kinks.
Why do you think more Americans should be listening to The Kinks?
Most Americans don't really know much about The Kinks. They know "You Really Got Me" and a few other songs that are not representative of The Kinks.
Well, what can you tell me about The Kinks?
The Kinks were led by brothers, Ray and Dave Davies, and were one of England's finest rock bands. They started in London and went through many different eras.
What were the different eras they went through?
Well, the most prominently talked about are their early rock'and'roll stuff, their golden age, and then their theatrical era.
Which of those eras are your favorite?
The golden age of The Kinks stuff, for sure.
So what's happening during the golden age of The Kinks? What's so good about it?
That period is from 1965-1972 and it started with a bunch of great albums. The songs are literate, weird, and socially aware.
How are their songs socially aware?
Well, they write about class and war and life in England. For one, their song Dead End Street, is really sarcastic and great.
Well, what's a song you would recommend?
"Lola" is a great song. It's about a trans person and accepting them. It's a great hard rock pop song.
Okay, so what's your favorite album by The Kinks?
Arthur or the Decline and Fall of the British Empire is my absolute favorite. It wasn't a huge commercial success but it's a great mix of pop and social commentary.
I'll have to check that one out.
Yeah, get that and The Village Green Preservation Society.
