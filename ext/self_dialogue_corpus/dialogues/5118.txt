What do you think about the Astros this year?
They've got a good team.
Do you think they have a shot to make it to the World Series?
I think so, they are a well balanced team
What do you like about the team?
Their lineup is strong offensively, they have maybe the best bullpen in baseball and they are good defensively.
What do you think is their biggest weakness?
Right now, the staring pitching.  They should get one more quality starter for the fifth or sixth spot.
Do you think they will?
They have one of the best front offices in baseball.  I think they will get one.
Who do you think is their biggest obstacle in the American league?
Probably the Yankees.
Yeah, the Yankees are always loaded.  In fact, they're playing the Yankees tonight.
I know, it should be a great matchup.
Keuchel for the Astros and Pineda for the Yankees.
It doesn't get much better than that.
It will probably be the best game in baseball tonight.
I agree, it should be fun.
Are you going to watch it?
You bet, I've  already got my chips and beer ready.
