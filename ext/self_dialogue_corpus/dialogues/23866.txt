What is the most recent movie that you have watched?
It was an old movie, Scrooged.
That is an old movie.
It is, but it is really funny.
When was that movie released?
It was released in 1988.
Bill Murray is a really funny guy.
Yes he is, I also like Ground Hog's Day.
Yes, that is another oldie but a goodie.
That one isn't as old though, it was released in 1993.
Did the same person direct both movies?
No, Harold Ramis directed Ground Hog's Day, and Richard Donner directed Scrooged.
Both very good movies, what other movies does Bill Murray play in?
Well don't tell me you forgot about Ghost Busters
Oh wow! I did forget about that movie.
It is a classic for sure.
Ghost Busters has a great cast all around.
Yes it does, I believe it was released in 1984, right?
Yes it was, we should watch Ghost Busters now.
Ok, I'll make the popcorn.
