What was that movie that had the dinosaur in it?
Dinosaur?
Well, that was a Disney movie, but the other dinosaur movie?
I think you're thinking of The Good Dinosaur.
Yep, that's the one.  It was quite good, don't you think?
I liked it.  I wasn't expecting much, but enjoyed the story.
I'm not sure why some dinosaurs had human eyes and others didn't.
Guess they wanted to show a more human side of those creatures.
Yeah, was just a bit weird to see, that's all.
The movie was still a good time though.
