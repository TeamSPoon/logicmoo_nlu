Did you hear that they're making a new Bond movie.
That's great. I love Bond.
What did you think of SPECTRE
At first I was only liked it a little, but I rewatched it and liked it more a second time
Yeah, some of the political things really foreshadowed today didn't it.
Well, that's what good Bond has always done.
What's your favorite Bond film?
I think it's Moonraker
Oh, so you're a Roger Moore guy.
Actually I liked Connery more in the role, but I still love Moonraker.
