Did you ever see American Psycho with Christian Bale?
Yes that's one of my favorite movies. He definitely was psycho in that movie.
I definitely liked him better in that than I did The Dark Knight.
Oh yeah that's for sure. I love that he would play Phil Collins whenever he got ready to kill.
I know right! I wonder how Phil Collins felt about that.
I'm sure he didn't feel too bad. He got paid royalties off of it.
Oh of course how could I forget that. I'm sure he was fine with it.
Did you think he was ever going to have a change of heart while you were watching it?
At one point I did, when he was confessing.
Turns out he was just having a meltdown but he went right back to his old self.
