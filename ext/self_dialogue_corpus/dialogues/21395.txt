hey what are you doing tonight?
I think I'm going to stay in and watch a movie?
Oh cool. Which movie are you going to watch?
I think I'm going to watch a Studio Ghibli film.
Is that the studio that did My Neighbor Totoro?
Yes that is! I love their films.
I've only seen Totoro but I loved it! It was such a cute film.
I agree. I'm not sure which one to watch though.
I wish I could make a suggestion but I've only seen one Studio Ghibli film.
I think I'm going to watch Kiki's Delivery Service.
What's that one about?
It's about a witch who turns 13 years old and goes off on her own.
Actually, I think I might have heard of that one.
It's one of my favorites and the first Studio Ghibli film I've seen.
I really want to watch that one now!
You definitely should! You will not be dissappointed.
Which other one would you recommend?
I would recommend all of them! But you could start with Spirited away.
Okay I will keep that one in mind.
Let me know if you want more film suggestions!
