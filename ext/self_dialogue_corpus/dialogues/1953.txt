Whats your favorite team
Patriots, I grew up in Boston
You must get sick of winning?
No,because they stunk so bad in the 80's and 90's it was sad.
How do you think they will do this year?
Anything less than a Super Bowl win is a loss.
Who did they add this year again?
They added Cooks to the Wr core and Allen as a TE. They had small adds here and there on defense but the biggest is Gilmore.
They have like 5 running backs now?
I just was reading that they might dump Lewis,sad that he hasn't regained preinjury form yet.
Will Julien E fall off this year?
I don't know he's taken some huge licks over the years, look at Welker.
Will Cooks have over 1000 receiving yards?
I would say so,but who knows? He should be close or over unless hes hurt.
Will Gronk make it through the season?
That I can't answer. I would say it points to no more than yes..
When will Brady and Belicheck retire?
I think they go out together in 2 to 3 years.
Who do you think will be their biggest threat in the AFC?
If Denver has a qb this year. it will be them.
