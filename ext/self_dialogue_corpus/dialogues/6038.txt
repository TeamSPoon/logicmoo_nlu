What's your favorite Disney movie?
Um.. Wreck It Ralph.
Really? That's pretty modern for a 90s kid like yourself.
Are you saying I'm too old to watch Disney movies?
No I just thought you'd pick something older like Aladdin, The Lion King, or even Toy Story.
Well... if I had to pick something from my childhood then it'd probably be The Rescuers or yeah Aladdin was another favorite.
That's more like it. Mine is Beauty and the Beast and DuckTales the Movie: Treasure of the Lost Lamp.
Oh? Did you see the recently released live action Beauty and the Beast with Emma Watson?
I was there at the midnight premier! They did an absolutely fantastic job with it!
I couldn't agree more. Disney has been doing an amazing job with their live action reimaginings like Maleficent and Cinderella.
