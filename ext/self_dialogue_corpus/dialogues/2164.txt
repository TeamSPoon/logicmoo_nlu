Can't wait for this season!
I know, right?
What do you think the Falcons will do?
Tough to say, that was a brutal loss.
You think they'll be impacted by the Super Bowl loss?
I don't see how they are not.
What about the Patriots?
They're getting old but you can't count them out.
You think this will be Brady's last season?
Not sure but I would not be shocked.
You like any sleeper teams this year?
I don't think you can ever sleep on the Giants.
That's true, Eli still has some left and the addition of Marshall will help.
I just wonder if OBJ will mesh with Marshall.
Yeah, he is a bit of a prima donna.
Big time prima donna.
Alright, final prediction for the Super Bowl?
I like the Steelers and the Giants.
Hmm, interesting, well I can't wait.
Yep, September can't come soon enough.
