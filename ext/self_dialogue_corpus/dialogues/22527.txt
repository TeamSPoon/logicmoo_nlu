Have you seen the new Jason Bourne movie?
Yes I have.  I thought it was different then the last one.
I did too.  It was more introspective and thought provoking, though there was a lot of violence, too.
I thought it was a good balance between an adventure/thriller and drama.
The premise was very chilling.  That people who work for the government would allow themselves to have their identities stripped.
Yes, and it was fascinating that Jason wanted to find the truth of how he had gotten to be a killer.  How to salvage what was left of his life.
I was surprised at the zigzag path that Jason took, around the world and back, to find out who he was.
And how determined he was to find the truth.
But, if you remember, he had no way back.  The government was trying to kill him because he knew too much.
But with his talents he could have chosen to change his identity and start a new life.  Without all the drama.
Yes, but the premise was that he need to know to go on living.
True, but so many people died in his quest.
I think that was part of his mental agony.  He wanted to stop the program from doing what was done to him to others.
Yes, when he could have shot the asset sent to kill him, he didn't.  That made the asset think and decide not to shoot him.
I thought the ending was so appropriate.  A very satisfying movie.
If there were more movies with that amount of emotional investment into why the violence in the movie was taking place it would make for better movies.
Violence as a whole has become so commonplace, that it no longer holds my attention unless there is more to the violence.
I think that is very true.  Violence and the reason behind it is more complex then just shooting people dead.
I think you are right.  Do you think there will be another sequel.
I don't see how there could be.  Jason Bourne is now the person he was before.  With no desire to be Jason Bourne again.
