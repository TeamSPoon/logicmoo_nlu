Do you see any possible Finals that wouldn't be Cavs-Warriors at this point?
It would shock me if it was anything else.
I just can't see either of those teams losing four times in a series to anyone else.
If it's Boston I guess they have a chance, since they have home advantage.
Yeah, but Cleveland went in there last month and beat them by 25.
True, and San Antonio doesn't seem healthy in the West.
Boston at least may get the No.1 pick the draft.
How would that work?
They have someone's pick through a trade in the past, I want to say New Jersey
I'm hoping the Suns get the top pick. A 55-win team doesn't deserve to also get the top pick.
Who do you take if you are Phoenix and you get the top one?
Maybe Fultz from Washington..who else is there, Ball?
Yeah, Ball or maybe Jackson from Kansas.
I wonder about all of them. If Fultz is so great, how did Washington go 2-16 in league play?
Well then there is the headache of getting Ball, or should I say his dad.
And Jackson just doesn't seem like a franchise player...I guess I would take Fultz.
Trading down would also be a possibility. Plus Ball said he would only play for Lakers.
Did he say that or his dad?
I don't remember, but he just seems like he would fit in L.A.
Well Phoenix is fairly close to Los Angeles at least.
