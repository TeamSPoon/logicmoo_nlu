Which battle do you think is best in all the Star Wars movies?
It is a toss up between Hoth in The Empire Strikes Back and the second Death Star attack in Return of the Jedi.
Yeah, snow speeders in Empire were pretty cool.
I like the AT-AT walkers - the stop motion effects were awesome.
I think that the Imperial officers reactions to Vader made him seem that much more evil.
Also, the mystery surrounding the Emperor and his holograph appearance.
The line, "I am your father..." has to be the greatest Star Wars line ever.
In addition to "I love you...I know" - Empire has the best lines.
Very true - and they leave us in suspense as to what will happen next after Luke is rescued.
Right, at that point we didn't know what would happen to Han Solo.
