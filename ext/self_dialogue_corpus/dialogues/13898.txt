Did you know that Lady Gaga's real name is Stefani Joanne Angelina Germanotta?
Wow really.. I didn't know that.
She's one of my all time favorite singers.  Her performances are awesome.
I've seen her perform the song Bad Romance.  I really loved it.
I plan to go to her concert in Las Vegas in August.  Would you like to go?
That would be so much fun.  Let's plan to go.
I'll price the tickets.  Omg... I can't wait to see Lady Gaga on stage.
I hope she sings Born this way.  I love that song.
This will be the best trip ever.
I'm so excited.
