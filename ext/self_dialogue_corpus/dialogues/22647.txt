Have you seen the valerian trailer?
I have I don't know what to think of it.
Me too. At first I thought this is going to be awful.
It does look like it could go either way.
What has me unsure is I loved the fifth element.
How is that related?
Both films are by the same director.
Luc Besson, really/ That makes me think it has more of a chance now.
Exactly. Like I said I am torn.
Leon the professional was amazing also Luc.
Well I hope it can stand up to his other films.
Cara Delevingne is not the greatest actress though.
I only know her from her eyebrows.
She was in suicide squad as june moon.
I thought that movie was awful.
I thought jared leto was good.
I think he is great in other movies but not so much suicide squad.
phenomenal in dallas buyers club.
Oh I agree, his best performance yet.
I will always adore him as jordan catalano frommy so called life.
