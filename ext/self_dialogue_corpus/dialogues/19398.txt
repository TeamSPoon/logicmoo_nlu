Have you ever heard of New Medicine?
I don't think so. Are they a new group?
Not exactly, they've been around for a few years, though their first album didn't come out until 2010.
They were active before that?
That's what I heard. Supposedly they used to go by a different name but I don't know if that's true or not.
How many albums have they released since then?
Only one other in 2014. I'm sure they'll release another sooner or later.
If they keep that schedule, you'll probably get a new album next year in 2018.
You're probably right, but I would settle for some singles or something 'til then.
I understand. Having to listen to the same old handful of songs can get boring.
Actually, they do have one song that's really hard to find, and most people haven't heard it.
You don't say? What's the deal with that.
I don't know. It doesn't appear on either of their albums. I have an MP3 copy of it I found online.
It must not be too hard to find if you found a copy?
I got lucky. After that I tried to find it again, and it was nowhere to be found.
Well, it's gotta be on YouTube at least?
There's only one video of the song on YouTue, and it's acoustic. The copy I have is the full version.
That is really strange. What's the song called?
It's titled "Turning It Into This", and I think it was made back around the time of the first album. It's actually my favorite of their songs.
Crazy how songs can get lost like that. I'm glad you have a copy since you like it so much.
