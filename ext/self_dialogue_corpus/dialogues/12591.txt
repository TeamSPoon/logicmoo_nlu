Did you know that they guy who played C3PO has been the same in all of the Star Wars movies?
I read that he was he only actor in the franchise to be in all of the movies.
His voice is pretty unique so I couldn't imagine it without him.
C3P0 and R2D2 are some of my favorite characters.  They are like the Bert and Ernie of Star Wars.
I love that they are constantly bickering with eachother.
Did you know that they make a cameo in an Indiana Jones movie?
They are also in two Star Trek movies too!
I thought that Star Trek and Star Wars had a big rivalry.
I guess, but JJ Abrams directed both of them so I guess he gets to do that.
That is pretty cool, a neat little bit of trivia.
