Hey there!
Hi, how are you today?
Doin' just fine, super ready for the weekend.
Oh yeah? You doing anything special?
Hoping to go to the theater with my BF, haven't decided what I'm going to go see though.
I love movies, maybe I can help!
Sure, that'd be great!
What kind of films do you guys like?
Well, we're always up for fantasy and such.
What about the newest Pirates film? That one came out just last week so she probably hasn't seen it yet.
Ew, no. I'm so bored with those films, they should have stopped after the first.
Hm, okay. What about Wonder Woman?
Isn't that DC? Their last movies weren't that great.
It is, but all the reviews have been really positive about this one.
Oh, I didn't know that!
Yeah, and honestly judging by the trailer alone it looks really good.
Gal Gadot is Wonder Woman in this one, right?
Mmhm, she's an Israeli actress and she's quite talented.
Cool, I'll check it out--it is out now, right?
It premieres in theaters this weekend.
