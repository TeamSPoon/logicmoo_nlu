So who's your favorite rock star?
Well, I don't know if you'd call him a "rock star" the way you'd say that about Bowie or something, but Roger Waters for sure.
From Pink Floyd?
Yeah, especially late Pink Floyd. I prefer the Waters-driven melancholic wartorn era of that band.
Like what album? I'm only familiar with Dark Side Of The Moon.
Yeah that was an earlier one, David Gilmour had alot of input on that one. But The Wall for instance was mostly all Waters.
I saw that movie once, couldn't make heads or tails of it.
It's a concept album about war, and about Waters himself and how he felt like fame had turned him into a pseudo-fascist.
Whoa, I thought the Wall was just a metaphor for closing ourselves off from others
Yeah it was about that too, but that film and album had a definite defiant mean streak to it as well. Top notch rock in my opinion.
