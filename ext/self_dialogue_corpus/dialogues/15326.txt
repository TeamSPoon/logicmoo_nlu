What is your favorite Radiohead album?
Ok Computer is my favorite, hands down. I like what albums followed it, but to me, electro Radiohead is not the best Radiohead.
I used to think that too, but I just got A Moon Shaped Pool and I have to say, I'm blown away by it.
I heard some of the singles off the album, and I was really unimpressed. I expected more from them.
In my opinion, the 2 singles they released for the album were the weakest of all the tracks.
How was the rest of the album?
Beautiful! It is a very sad and haunting album.
Maybe I should give it another shot.
I think you should, I can see myself listening to this album a lot over the years.
What is your favorite track?
I actually thought Glass Eyes was one the more emotional songs, the lyrics are heartbreaking.
I'll definitely give it another chance. Hearing you talk about makes me interested again.
Funny how that happens.
I always like to hear another person's perspective on music.
Me too. I don't think any two people experience music the same way.
Exactly. What one person thinks is terrible, another person thinks magical.
If you want, I'll burn you a copy of  A Moon Shaped Pool.
Yes, I'd really like that. Thank you.
Its no trouble at all.
Well, thank you again anyway!
