Any good movies you've seen lately?
Not really, there haven't been a lot of good movies to come out.
I kind of feel that way, too.
It seems like every year there's a new superhero movie that people are dying to see.
I also feel that way, it feels like a money grab sometimes.
I think that's probably what it is, though I know Wonder Woman got great reviews.
Oh, I've heard that too. Have you seen it?
No, not yet. I've been meaning to fairly soon.
I would like to see it, I have high hopes for it and I love what people have been saying about the way it's directed.
I wish they would do more monster movies sometimes.
Don't they have a lot of horror movies that have monsters in them?
Hmm, I wouldn't really say so. A lot of horror movies lately have been about murderers or dark realistic concepts.
I guess you could be right. I'm not into horror movies really so I wouldn't know.
The Babadook was technically a monster movie.
Was that any good?
I thought it was great, but it's still kind of an older movie. It came out in 2014.
I think that's still a new movie then, anything older than five years to me would be an old movie.
If you say so. I just love that fear of something fantastical, you know?
I can understand that, it's a fun feeling.
Yeah, I get a big thrill out of watching the characters try to survive something unreal.
