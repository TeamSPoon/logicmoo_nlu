Have you heard of the song "I built a friend".
Yes.  I love it.
Did you see the kid perform to that song on America's got talent.
I sure did.  That was great.
That artist's name is Alec Benjamin.
Yep.  Alec is pretty talented.
His music sounds really unique.
Yes.  It's something with the way he tunes his voice.
Yes.  I think he already has a high pitched voice be he does something extra to it.
It's like he puts it an octave higher or something.
Yes.  It something done in electronic music but on in certain parts.
You are right.  Alec seems to do it throughout the entire song.
It sounds really good and unique.
Did you notice he came out with a music video recently for I built a friend.
I saw it.  It was pretty emotional.
I know.  I had me tear up.
That's so crazy considering it was about a robot.  It got to me too.
When it gets to the water part I just can't hold it in.  So touching.
I think the exposure for America's Got Talent made he release the video early or something.
I think so too.  It came out like a day later.
