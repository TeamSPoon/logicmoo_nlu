Did you see the Disney movie "Moana"?
Yes, I thought it had some of the best music since "Frozen".
Who were some of the voice actors?
Dwayne Johnson had a big part. He was the voice for Maui.
Who was the voice actress for Moana?
Auli'i Cravalho was the voice for Moana.
I am not familiar with that actress, but I liked her voice.
I think she is Hawaiian.
I liked "Moana" because it is the first time Disney had a Polynesian princess.
I agree, but i liked the setting best!
