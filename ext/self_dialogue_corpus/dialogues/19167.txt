I wish Luther Vandross was still alive.
Me too. I miss his music.
I was listening to A House is a Home about five minutes ago.
I like that song. I like This Christmas as well.
I know right. I be playing that song all year 'round.
Me too. My friends be trippin' talkin' 'bout, it's not Christmas time.
I don't care. Good music doesn't have a season.
Remember when he did the song with Mariah Carey?
You mean when they performed together on stage?
Yeah.
What was the name of that song?
I can't remember.
I like when he did songs with other artists.
I can't think of that many duets that he has.
Remember anything from his earlier days?
Of course. I like She Loves Me Back.
I like the one where he's on his way to work and then his girl stops over.
Oh, you're talking about Never Too Much.
I love that song.
Me too. The video be making me trip, people with Walkmans and stuff from the early eighties.
