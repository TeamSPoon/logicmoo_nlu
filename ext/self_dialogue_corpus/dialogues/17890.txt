Have you heard the new Killers song?
The Killers are still around? They haven't put anything out in forever!
It's been about 5 years actually! But yeah, they just put a new song out a week or so ago for their new album!
Cool, what's it called?
It's called "The Man." You should give it a listen!
What's so good about it? The Killers have always been hit or miss for me.
It's a really groovy song. Think in the style of the Bee Gees.
Oh, like disco? That sounds kind of interesting.
Yeah, it's pretty different from the kinds of songs they've put out before. Really catchy though!
Yeah, I'll have to give it a listen. Sounds like an interesting combination.
I've heard that they're coming out with a new album this Fall as well.
Really? That's awesome, I'm glad they're coming out with new stuff.
If the whole new album sounds like "The Man," it's going to be really interesting! I have high hopes for it.
That would be cool to see them go in a different direction. Their style has always stayed pretty much the same.
True. But "Hot Fuss" is one of my favorite albums of all time!
It is a pretty good album. A few good songs on there.
A lot of GREAT songs on there! "Mr. Brightside," "Smile Like you Mean It," and so many others! The whole album is pretty much played on the radio.
I guess I forgot about some of those songs, the album was released so long ago!
I promise you, it still holds up to this day. Each song is great.
I'll have to re-listen to it then. Great idea!
