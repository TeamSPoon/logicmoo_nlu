I love The Wizard of Oz!
Me too! Who's your favorite character?
The tinman.
I felt so bad he wanted a heart so badly.
Who was your favorite character?
I preferred the cowardly lion.
Aw, he was so cute.
Yes, he really developed as a character.
He did. He matured right before the audience's eyes.
What color was the Emerald City?
Green, silly. Emerald is a shade of green.
Oh, of course. I should've known that.
Yeah. That's like asking what color the yellow brick road was.
True. Did Dorothy get home at the end?
Yes, she made it back to Kansas via a hot air balloon.
Oh right. I forgot about that part.
Did she keep the ruby red slippers?
I honestly can't remember.
Me neither.
We should go watch it!
