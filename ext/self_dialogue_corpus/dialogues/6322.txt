Do you ever feel bad for the villains in disney?
Yes, sometimes.
I feel like some of them got a little more than they deserved.
Like Facillier being dragged to the underworld.
Yea, but what if he was left to keep doing all of his dark magic-
That would have been a little problematic.
True, but the underworld?!
I don't know if he would have reformed though.
I don't know he may have been scared into reformity.
Being threatened by evil spirits can definitely do that to you.
