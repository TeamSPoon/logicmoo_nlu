Do you prefer Terminator 1, or 2?
I love part 2, but part 1 is the best.
Why is that?
I prefer Arnold as a bad guy. It was cool to see him not as the hero.
I agree. But, part 2 was pretty cool.
Yeah, that liquid bad guy was cool.
Part 1 had a cooler story. Plus, that night club scene was terrific.
Do you like other Arnold movies?
Yeah, Predator, Kindergarten Cop, Conan are all amazing.
They are. I love his movies.
