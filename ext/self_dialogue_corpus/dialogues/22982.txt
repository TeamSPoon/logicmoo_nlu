Name a movie with a title that makes no sense
Just one?
If you can do more, go for it.
Made In America with Ted Danson and Whoopi Goldberg
I don't know that one.
Whoopi Goldberg uses a sperm donor and then finds out 18 years later that the donor was a very white Ted Danson
That sounds like it would be funny
It is.  But the title makes no sense.
What do they claim the title means?
They don't say.  However, in the trailer the announcer says that a mistake like this could only be made in America.
Well, I guess that works.  But if you don't see the trailer, you wouldn't know that.
Guess they couldn't think of aything better.  Your turn.
Well I was thinknig of the movie Oscar.
The one with Sly Stallone??
Yeah, when I first heard of the movie, I thought he was Oscar but you only hear about Oscar and then he appears for 30 seconds at the end.
True but at least it makes some sense.
Not really.  They could have come up with a better title.  Something that wasn't just about the guy the daughter was dating but doesn't even end up with.
Going Straight or Don't Call Me Boss would have been better
Oh yeah, I like Don't Call Me Boss.  It's something that Sly Stalone says a lot.
Yeah he does or call it by his nickname Snapps.
