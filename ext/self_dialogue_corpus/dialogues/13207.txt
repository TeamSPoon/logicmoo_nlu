Who is your favorite Star Wars hero from those movies?
Let's see, Jar Jar Binks.
You're kidding right?  How is Jar Jar a hero?
Bear with me. He's a great kid's hero!
Okay, how so?
Despite his fumbling and bumbling misadventures, he kept at it.
He made a lot of mistakes.
True, but he didn't let that stop him.
I remember the way he talked to himself for encouragement.
He did okay!  In the end he got his rewards.
