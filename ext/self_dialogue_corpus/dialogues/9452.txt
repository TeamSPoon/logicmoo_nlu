You have to check him out.

I really like his song "New Faces".
I will check it out. Is he good with lyrics?
Yeah he's got an interesting mind. He's good with beats too.
Is it old-school sounding?
No, it has a newer sound to it. It's unique though.
Awesome, I'm always looking for new rap music. I'm not a big fan of old-school rap.
