What is one of your favorite horror movie reboots?
I enjoyed Friday the 13th from 2009.
That was an interesting one.  I really liked seeing Jared Padalecki's performance.
He is really good in Supernatural, so it was a natural pivot for him to do this movie.
I also was not expecting the death scene with Jenna near the end.
That was the part that made me sad.  They got so far to the end.
I'm just glad that Clay was able to find his sister.
Can you imagine being locked up with only Jason to feed you like she was?
No, I don't think I would have made it for the 6 months she was there.
Maybe Jason will stay dead now after this movie.
