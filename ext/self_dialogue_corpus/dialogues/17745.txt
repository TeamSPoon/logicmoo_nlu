What types of music do you enjoy?
Well, I am pretty open to many kinds of music, I like a little bit of many genres
Well, do you have favorite genres
Yes, probably, rock and alternative
Why are your tastes so varied?
Well, I play music, so I am open to many different types, it is all fun and challenging
I've noticed musicians often don't have the musical prejudices ordinary people do
That's true, they often join with musicians of other genres, they just love making music
Any paticular time period of music that you prefer
Well, late 60se early 70s and then the late 80s early 90s
I like those periods too, I really don't care for much of what is out now
Neither do I , I think there has been a corporate takeover of music and it really isn't so good
Yes, money ruins culture I suppose
Yes, and they want control, want to choose the message
The message should come from the hearts of the people
Yes, that is why music is so revolutionary, and so threatening
So they try to control it, make it about sex and money
Yep, that's what it seems like to me anyway
Well, I would agree with you
Not surprising, since we are the same you and I!
