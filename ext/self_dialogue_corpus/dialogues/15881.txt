What is your favorite alternative rock band that has now broken up?
My Chemical Romance was a really good band.
What do you like about them?
They had lyrics which had deep meaning, but the songs were also easy on the ears.
I think that's why they were so popular.
Yes. It's not enough to have good lyrics or message.
Your songs have to be catchy too, right?
Exactly. My Chemical Romance hit the sweet spot there.
What is your favorite album from them?
I would say, The Black Parade.
That's a really cool album. Several songs from it are still stuck in my head.
"Welcome to the Black Parade" is an enduring classic.
I love the music video for it too!
Yeah, that was also really cool.
Do you think they will get back together again?
I'm not sure. It looks like Gerard Way is producing solo albums.
Maybe they will resolve their differences someday.
I hope so! They can put out some really good music.
No disagreement there!
"Carry on" as they would say!
