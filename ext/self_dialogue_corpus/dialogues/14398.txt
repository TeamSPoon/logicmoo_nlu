Hey did you see that article about Kevin Durant?
What about him?
Apparently he removed Russell Westbrook from his phone contacts.
Are you serious? Wow...how do you know?
Because they said that Westbrook tried to call him when he was in town and Durant texted back "Who is this?"
I never thought that would happen, it's a shame. I really don't like Golden State.
Dude, me either. I respect Durant's game but I don't like these things they've been saying about him.
Same here. Russell Westbrook is doing so well though.
Agreed! All those triple doubles, it's insane.
I'm actually trying to get tickets to an OKC game next week. Would you want me to get you a ticket?
Of course man, that would be so much fun!
I'll make sure to do that. I'm really liking Westbrook lately and they're playing the Timberwolves.
Are they from Minnesota?
Yeah! Their team is really stepping it up lately.
Agreed. Karl Anthony Townes is my favorite player probably.
Yeah, way less drama on that team. Plus, they have a great spirit.
I know what you mean. We should try to go to games more often.
Yeah we should. I just hope that I can still enjoy watching the Thunder without Durant.
Yeah its too bad...but I'll see you next week then?
Yes of course!
