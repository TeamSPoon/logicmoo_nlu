Have you seen the Star Wars movies?
Yeah man I love the Revenge of the Sith.
That one isn't so bad, but I hate the rest so badly. Well, aside from the original trilogy.
What the heck, why?
I feel like they ruined then prequels, A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back, and Return of the Jedi were all masterpieces, from Luke finding out he's force sensitive to him pretending to go with Darth Vader, his father, to the dark side, they were phenomenal.
You're looking at them thru rose-tinted glasses, they were good but the recent ones are much better.
Just because they used more computer doesn't mean they're better.
Well no, but the new characters are great and the stories are more complex and better.
Well, Jar Jar Binks is the worst creation in all of film history, so there's that.
You're just a hater of new things man :(
