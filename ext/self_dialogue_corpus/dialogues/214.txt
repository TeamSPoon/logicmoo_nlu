What superhero movies would you recommend for a family?
I would say the incredibles. It is a super hero family.
I guess each family member would have someone to identify with. Do you think adults would actually enjoy it?
Yes, I do. I enjoyed it myself, many animated films now a days have a lot of adult humor, it may go over the heads of you little ones but still lots for them to enjoy.
I think you have a point, Sometimes now I catch jokes now that I did not when I watched a film as a child.
Me too. I would also recommend maybe the original 90s batman films, batman forever and returns, but maybe a little dark depending on ages of family.
I love those films, ya I think my daughter is a little young still for those just yet.
If you want to appeal to your daughter I would suggest the new wonder woman or kick ass both have strong female role models.
That is a good suggestion. I heard the new wonder woman is wonderful.
Gal godot is great and the film is all around enjoyable.
