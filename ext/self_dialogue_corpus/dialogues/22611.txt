who do think is the most beautiful hollywood actress?
For me it is Catherine Zeta-Jones.
I think she was better looking when she was younger.
I agree slightly. I still think of her as incredibly beautiful.
She peaked for me in entrapment.
She was good in that. Sean connery was great as well.
Sean is great in everything, but she may have stolen the movie in the jumpsuit laser scene.
haha, maybe true. Very memorable.
I personally love that she also got her start in theater.
I liked her a lot in chicago.
Oh yes! She  got to show off some skills in that film.
It was a good rendition of a stage show.
It was great it won and was nominated for so many academy awards.
Deservedly so. I thought John C Reilly was great!
I loved his mr cellophane number.
It was super strong.
I also was surprised by renee being such a good dancer.
I was surprised to see how skinny she was in this film.
She really was too thin.
I think you may be right. All that gain and loss for roles took a toll on her.
