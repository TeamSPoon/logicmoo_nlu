I love movies about college.
Me too. Have you ever seen Old School?
Nope. What is that about?
It's about a bunch of old men who start a fraternity.
That is way out of line!
It is. Will Farrell is great in it. He plays a crazy drunk.
That has to be a wonderful combo. I loved him on Saturday Night Life.
That was some of his best work. You should check this out though.
I want to now. Is it just comedy or is there anything else?
There are some romantic stories too. I think it is a well balanced movie.
