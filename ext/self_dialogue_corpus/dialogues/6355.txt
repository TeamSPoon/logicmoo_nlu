I read that The Incredibles 2 is supposed to come out next year!
Really? How old do you think Dash and Violet will be in the movie?
Probably the same age, would be a big risk having them be older.
Do you think Jack Jack will finally use his powers in front of his family?
I really hope so, especially after watching Jack Jack attack.
Because I liked the first Incredibles so much I'm a bit scared to watch the second one.
It could be like finding Dory; interesting but not nearly as good.
Yeah, hopefully nothing like Cars 2, which was terrible.
Agreed, Cars 2 was nowhere near as good as Cars 1.
I suppose we will have to wait and see how good the new movie is then.
