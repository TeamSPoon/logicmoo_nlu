Have you heard the latest from Lady Gaga?
Not yet, I was going to give it a listen on Spotify just now.
I think it's one of the best things she's done yet.
What's so good about it.
It's got great rhythm and the lyrics are really amazing.
Cool. Do you think the rest of the album will be that good?
It's Lady Gaga, what do you think?
Okay, I'll take your word for it. Huh, this is good.
See? When have I ever lied to you?
Well, there was that time you tried to convince me you were Michael Jackson's illegitimate son...
