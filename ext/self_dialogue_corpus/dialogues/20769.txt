Hey, remember when we used to go to the movies all the time together?
Yeah, those were the good old days.
Well, I was thinking, do you want to start doing it again, even if it's once a year?
Of course I do, is there anything good coming out this year?
Well, I'm super excited for It to come out.
Me too man, I think it has potential to be one of the greatest book adaptations.
What did you think of the original It movie?
I loved it!  It wasn't as scary as I was hoping.
I know what you mean.  I just watched it the other week after not seeing it for like 10 years.
How'd that go?
It made me realize how cheesy it was.
Haha, I've had that happen a couple times rewatching old movies.
But, after watching the trailers for the new ones, I don't think I could be more excited.
I know man!  Pennywise looks super creepy.
I just heard they're making it rated R too, so that made me even more excited.
Really? That's great news.  I feel like they held back a lot in the original.
I know!  The book is so violent, and I didn't get that feeling from the original.
Now you've got me super excited, when does it come out?
September 8!  You down to go?
Yes! I'll put it in my calendar right now.
