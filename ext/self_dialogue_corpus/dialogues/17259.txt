Did you go out to see the Elvis Costello concert last week?
No!  I didn't even know he played!  When was it?
The 13th of June - over at Heinz Hall.
Man, that's awesome.  I'm sorry I missed it.  What did he play?
A lot of stuff off Imperial Bedrooms.  He ended up doing two sets.
Did he play Alison?
Yeah!  He actually played that acoustically with his backup singers.  It was really amazing.
I am so jealous.  How did he sound?
He sounded good.  I mean, the sound in the theater was a little wonky, but Elvis himself sounded amazing.  He's definitely still got it.
I'm sorry I missed it.  Imperial Bedrooms is one of my favorite albums ever.  Did he play all the songs off of it?
Mostly!  He played Pidgin English, On the Way, You Little Fool, and other stuff.
I love those songs!  What was your favorite?
I loved when he played Watching the Detectives.  He was all awash in green light and it was super cool.
Where were you sitting?
Front row center, if you believe it!  I about died!
I can imagine!  How did he look?
Well, he's much shorter in real life.  Also he looked pretty old.
Well, he is old!
True.  All in all he sounded like the same Elvis Costello of years before.
That's cool.  I can't believe I missed it!
