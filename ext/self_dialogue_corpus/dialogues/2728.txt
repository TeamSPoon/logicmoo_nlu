Cowboys VS Rams opener.
What about it?
What are your thoughts on it?
Well, i think it's going to be a very uneventful game.
How so?
Well, nomo Romo for starters, the Rams arent that great so.....
So you think it's gonna be a non excitement game?
I think it will be so stereotypical that it will be tied at the end and whoever recieves the ball will win it.
So a coin toss will determine that game?
Pretty much.
Wow, that's hard to hear.
Sorry, but both teams need a serious reboot.
Any other teams in the same boat or worse off?
Well, Jacksonville always.
Yeah, they are gonna get clobbered in the Pre-Season opener.
No doubt.
Giants and Jets are gonna struggle Pre-Season too.
Giants?
Yeah, there not bringing the excitement.
I was thinking more like The Browns.
