What kind of rock music do you like to listen to?
Lately, I've been listening to a lot of old stuff like The Cure. I also have always listened to AFI, if you've heard of them.
Yeah, I remember AFI from the early two-thousands. They've changed so much since then, I can't really bring myself to listen to them.
I actually like their new sound. I guess that's just to be expected when you've made music for decades though.
Yeah, I guess that is right. It would be hard to think up so many songs in one sub-group that long.
I've come to love their newer stuff. I started listening to them when Miss Murder debuted and then just started listening to all of their stuff.
I first heard of them way before that, probably when the Sing The Sorrow Album came out.
Well, that wasn't too long before, but I went back and listened to that album too after falling in love with their December Underground album.
The only song I liked on that album was actually Kill Caustic. It sort of reminded me of their old sound.
Yeah, that is one song which stands out in the album against the others.
