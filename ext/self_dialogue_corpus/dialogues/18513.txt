Are you listening to classical music?
Yes, from a composer named Frederic Chopin.
I've never heard of him but it sounds good.
He's good, but I don't think he got much recognition during his lifetime.
People didn't like his music?
Much of his work is very short compared to other compositions at the time.
Short like modern music?
Yes.  I like to think that he was actually ahead of his time.
What's the name of the song you're listening to?
It's called Prelude Op. 28 Number 4.
Prelude?  Seems like a strange name.
As I said, much of his work is very short compared to other artists.
So what is it a prelude to?
I don't think anything, they're just a set of short songs that he wrote.
And that's why you think he was ahead of his time?
Yes, because instead of creating huge orchestrated pieces, he simply wrote smaller, varying pieces.
That's definitely not very common among classical artists.
Right, most of the work people hear about is very long and in depth like Mozart's symphonies.
I might take the time to investigate some of Chopin's preludes, this one sounds really good.
There's several of them.  I can let you have a listen to the few that I have.
