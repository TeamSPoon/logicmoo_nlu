What do you think of video game music?
I don't really listen to that kind of music a lot.
Not even when you're playing the games that have music?
Well, yeah when I'm playing games I kind of have to listen to it.
Do you like what you hear?
I guess I do, but it goes on in the background so you don't really pay attention that much to it.
That's actually why I like it so much.
Now that you mention it, I could see it being good background music.
It's especially good for doing homework, because it's both relaxing and helps you focus.
What are some of the better artists that do video game music?
I'm not sure what the guy's name is, but the person who does the music for the Fable games does a great job.
What does he sound like?
He wrote a lot of great melodies to be played by an orchestra, so it's kind of like classical music.
That's interesting, is it any good?
I love all the music from the first game. Each song is very memorable and fills you with a lot of emotion.
Wow, that's pretty rare for music in a video game.
I would say so too, it's rare to have really good music in a video game.
Are there any other games that have great music?
I like all the music in the Final Fantasy games a lot, most of that is orchestral too.
I guess orchestral video game music is some of the best then.
