That series between the Pens and Caps was impressive.
Totally. I thought Pittsburgh was going to run away with it after taking the first two in Washington.
The entire feel of the series turned when Crosby got knocked out.
I agree. The Pens power play went down hill in a hurry.
It seemed like they had no idea what to do without him.
The Penguins looked completely lost.
I was surprised they were able to come back in game 4 without Crosby.
Yes. That was the swing game in the series I think.
The overtime game was also exciting.
Playoff hockey is so much more intense than the regular season, and overtime games even more so.
I think the first round this year set a record for overtime games.
I heard that too. Wasn't it 17 games?
That sounds right. Who do you like in the Western conference.
I think the Predators are going to take care of business. They're playing great hockey already knocking off the Blackhawks and Blues.
What about the East?
I'm sticking with the Pens. I can't really explain how Ottawa got by Boston or NY.
I think you're right on both. If that happens, I think the finals will be pretty intense.
Well, the Pens are ready for that. Washington was all over them and outshot them by a huge margin last round.
They'll have to get past Ottawa first.
I think it will go 6 games and the Predators will win in 5.
