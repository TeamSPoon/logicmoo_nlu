I'm spending time with my daughter today and she is wanting to watch a good animated movie, any suggestions?
Has she seen any of the Disney princess movies?
Oh yeah she loves all of them, especially Frozen, Snow White, and The Little Mermaid.
My little girl loves those to. She can sing all the Frozen songs by heart.
My daughter walks around all day just singing all the song from that movie to.
Have you all watched the newer movie Moana?
No we haven't seen that one. Is it a Disney movie?
Yeah it is the newest movie from Disney. I bet your daughter would really love that one.
Who all stars in that movie?
Dwayne Johnson plays a large part in it and another girl plays this strong female role.
We may have to check that one out. I love it when she watches movies with strong female lead roles.
Yeah that is definitely a great way to instill confidence in little girls.
Are there any new Dr. Seuss movies out these days?
I'm not sure. The last movie I remember is The Lorax.
Oh even I love The Lorax.
Yeah it has some really great songs in it and definitely a great meaning behind the story.
Yeah I think it teachers kids a great lesson.
I think it teaches them how in order for things to change in this world, they need to care and want to see a change and then do something about it.
It is definitely a great movie and teaches some really great lessons.
You know, I think I might just go watch that one again myself.
