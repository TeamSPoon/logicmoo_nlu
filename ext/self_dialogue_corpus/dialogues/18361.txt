What do you think of Sabaton?
Sabaton? Who are they?
They're a Swedish Heavy Metal band, with a taste for military historical songs.
Military histrocial songs, what are those?
They're songs about military history, battle mnoslty, set to heavy metal rock music.
Okay, I think I understand. Could you give a few examples.
Well, the song Sparta is about Leonidas and the 300 at Thermopylae.
Okay, I know about that battle. Is it a good song?
Yes, it is an excellent piece of heavy metal.
Okay, how about another example?
Well, the song Resist and Bite is about the Belgian Chasseurs Ardennais in WWII.
Okay, so what did they do and is the song good. Also, what is the meaning of the title.
Well, the Chasseurs Ardennais put up fierce resistance to the advance of the Germans into belgium, so the song is excellent, and the title is the translation of the units Latin motto.
Okay, I'm getting a bit of theme here, last stands and agianst all odds battles. Anymore goods song that you recommend.
Well, there is Man of War, which is a tribute to the classic heavy metal band Manowar.
Okay, anything else?
Well, my personal favorite is Stalingrad.
Okay, I can guess what that one is about, but do they have anything from WW1?
Yes, the Lost Battalion and Last Dying Breath are both about different WW1 battles.
Okay, that band sounds like its worth a look at, thanks.
