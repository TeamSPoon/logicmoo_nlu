I can't wait for 3 days of football a week!
Yeah I know! Sunday, Monday and Thursday funday returns!
Have you decided if you are doing any fantasy teams this year?
Absolutely! Ever since the draft, I have been doing my research on the players, teams, and schedules to figure out who to draft.
Who do you think will have a breakout season this year?
The hometown Philadelphia Eagles seem to be the best team out there in my mind. So much talent and youth to excel in this league.
Carson Wentz showed us he was the real deal last year. I am definitely onboard the Wentz Wagon!
Who would have thought that a kid from a small school in North Dakota would be the savior that the Eagles were looking for?
Well the Eagles may be a whole lot better this year, but they still need to go through Dallas to get to the Superbowl.
Yeah talking about a good team, I can only see this team get better over time.
Absolutely! As it hurts me to say this, but I really like the talent they have on the Cowboys.
I dunno who is the better quarterback, Dak Prescott or Carson Wentz.
I want to say Carson as he needed to work with less and seemed to be a better player in the long run last season.
Not taking away from Carson's accomplishments, but Dak was definitely on fire more times than not last season.
True. I do think that whenever these teams play each other, it's gonna be a battle to the end each and every time.
Yes, they match up very well and will be fun to watch.
Any feelings towards the other teams in the division?
No not really. I think the Giants will be ok, but it is all dependent with Odell Beckham and how he pans out this season
You can say that about Kirk Cousins on the Skins
Yeah he is definitely hit or miss.
