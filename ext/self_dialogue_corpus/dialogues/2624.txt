The Dolphins had a pretty good year, don't you think?
Yeah, they weren't bad.
Didn't they make the playoffs?
I think so, but got bounced by the Patriots or something.
I sometimes forget that Suh is on their team.
That guy is a menace.
He is, but I'm not sure he's worth the money.
Yeah, they paid him a truckload.
But he's not really producing a whole lot with stats.
He's probably freeing up some other defensive players more I think.
Yeah, like Cameron Wake.  He's underrated.
I like him, but he's on the wrong side of 30 now.
On the offensive side, Tannenhill seems like he's doing okay.
He was pretty solid last year.  Had some trouble with accuracy.
I think he always has.
But he's got young legs and that keeps them in some games.
I really like their running back.
You mean Jay Ajayi?  Yeah, great pick.
He's speedy, makes good cuts, just a good player.
He was a good example of drafting running backs low and getting maximum production from them.
