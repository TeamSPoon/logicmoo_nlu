What first got you into watching Star Wars?
I just randomly saw a part of one of the original movies and I thought it was really cool.  I ended up renting the original trilogy and I was hooked!
That is great!  The original trilogy totally made me a Star Wars lover!  Do you have a favorite?
I do!!  Return of the Jedi is my favorite!!  I love how Luke comes in and stands up to the emperor and also when Darth Vader throws him over the balcony and kills him.
I totally agree!  Plus the Ewoks were adorable! lol
Yes they were!!  What do you think about the new trilogy that they started?
I like it but of course nothing can beat the original trilogy!  Til this day, those are the best movies ever made!
Yes they are!!  I did really like Rogue one though!!  It fit in very well with the others.
I agree!!  That last scene with Princess Leia saying "Hope"...OMG! I just about wanted to scream!!
Me too!!!
