Did you watch a good movie last weekend?
Yep. I was able to convince my husband to watch Nocturnal Animals.
Oh yeah? I vaguely heard about it.
It's really good. Even my husband actually loved it.
Who made it?
Tom Ford.
Tom Ford? Like, the fashion designer?
Yep. The guy at some point decided he'd make movies, and he pulled it off.
Really? He's good?
He's really good. And I saw that he also wrote the script for Nocturnal Animals. The guy is really talented.
So what is it about?
It's a very simple story, really. About a woman who receives in the mail the manuscript of a novel written by her first husband.
Oh? Doesn't sound like there is much in there to make a movie.
Well, it's just the beginning, isn't it? It gets hairier because as she reads the novel, we get to see it unfolding onscreen.
Is it a drama?
Oh yeah. Very much so. But the beauty of it is that it's so simple.
Is it slow paced?
Not really. But it doesn't treat the viewer like a moron you know. It lets you figure things out.
I like that. And who's in it?
Amy Adams, fantastic as usual. Jake Gyllenhall, fantastic as well. And a bunch of people I didn't know. but all very good.
