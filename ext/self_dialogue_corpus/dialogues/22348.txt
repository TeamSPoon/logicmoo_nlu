Do you like movies based on books?
No, they are all horrible
They only one I thought was okay was Beautiful creatures, but it was still nowhere as good.
Fifty shades of gray was awful too
It was, it definitely was not what I was expecting.
I dont think it was what anyone was expecting
Me either
What about the hunger games?
Those ones were horribly terrible
No, they are watchable without cringing
Did you read or watch beastly?
No were they good?
Yea, I thought they were okay.
What are they about?
They are kind of like a modern day Beauty and the Beast
That sounds interesting
They were, it was a great spin
I'll have to check them out
You should
I will
