Have you seen that movie "Babette's Feast"?
No, who's in that?
It's actually a foreign movie so you probably won't know the actors.
Oh, what's it about?
It's about this lady who moves to a village as a refugee who feeds the entire town off of her lottery winnings without telling them she spent it all on them.
That sounds weird.
It's actually very touching and it has some very subtle humor laced all throughout that movie.
Is it going to make me cry?
Probably not, it's probably going to make you laugh, a lot, and feel endeared to the character.
What language is it in?
It the movie they speak Dutch, I believe...but it's easy to find one with English subtitles.
I hate subtitles.
It is very worth it even with the subtitles.
If it's foreign, how can we see it?
It actually did over 4 million in the US so it's not like no one has ever heard of it, you just rent it online.
I'll check it out but what is your favorite part of the whole movie?
There are so many good parts in it...like I said, it really has a lot of subtle humor that makes the movie a true gem.
Is it humor that anyone will get?
Oh sure, it's just not in your face telling you to laugh like most US movies, this one actually assumes you're already intelligent enough to know when something is funny.
Oh, ok, actually, now I'm really intrigued.
