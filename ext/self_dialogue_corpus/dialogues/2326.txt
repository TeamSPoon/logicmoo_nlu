Hey, did you watch the NFL draft this year?
Of course, I never miss it.
What do you think about the 49ers picks?
I think the nailed it in the first few rounds. Solomon Thomas and Reuben Foster were excellent choices.
They need something. They have been terrible.
I know. Plus their quarterback situation is so different now.
Yeah, Kaepernick and Gabbert left and now all eyes are on Hoyer.
I hope he can do well for them, but there is still alot that is unknown.
You know, I am really hoping the Falcons can keep it together and make it back to the Super Bowl.
I am not really a Falcons fan, but it was a very disappointing loss for them this past year.
Matt Ryan deserves another shot at a ring.
I agree, I think he's been an excellent quarterback for many years, and deserves more recognition.
Yeah, but with Tom Brady still in the league, who knows.
Tom Brady has dominated for too long. I think someone else should get the spotlight.
Yes, he's won many rings. But if he's still healthy and successful, all power to him.
My eyes are on the Raiders. With Carr and Lynch, they are going to be interesting to watch.
There is definitely a lot of potential there.
I saw an interview with Carr after it was announced that he would get the largest contract in history, and he talked about tithing and living the same way. I thought that was really cool.
Wow, that is different. I hope he succeeds.
Me too. I think their team will go through alot of growth this year and in the years to come.
