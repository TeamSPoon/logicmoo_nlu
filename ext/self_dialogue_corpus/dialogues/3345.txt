Have you ever seen any horror movies starring Jamie Lee Curtis?
Yes, I think I have.
One of her movies is called Halloween that came out in 1978.
Oh yeah, right. Of course I've seen that movie.
I always thought of that movie when I went babysitting!
Me too! Jamie played the part perfectly.
She was quite a match against Mike Meyers.
She sure was. I can't think of a better character for him to go up against.
Did you see the next Halloween movie?
Yes I did, I didn't think it was as good as the first, but I still liked it. It's a classic.
