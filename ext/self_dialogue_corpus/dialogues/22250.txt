Do you like the Men in Black series?
I do.  It's one of my favorites.
Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones make a great team.
They do!
I'm surprised they haven't made another sequel.
I thought a new one was coming out soon.
I haven't heard anything about it.
That's too bad.  Those movies were fun.
The nullifier is awesome!!
Yeah, imagine being able to erase people's memories?
That would be cool, but also scary.
I'd worry that I'd fry someone's brains!!
That seems all too easy to do!
Well, maybe you could fix it with their technology if that happened.
I'd hope so.
Don't they have a Men in Black ride in Universal?
They do.
Well then, it's time for another movie!
I think so.
Here come the Men in Black...!
