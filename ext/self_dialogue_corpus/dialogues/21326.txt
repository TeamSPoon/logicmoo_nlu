Have you seen the new movie, Fantastic Beasts and Where to find them?
Yes I did, what did you think? Better than Harry Potter?
Not better, but I thought it was not as impressive as the book, but I still enjoyed it.
I agree, but I loved Colin Ferrel and Eddie Redmayne were amazing!
I would have to agree, Eddie was wonderful as Newt.
I can't wait for the next movie!
I heard there'll be new additions to the cast.
Really? Did they already decide that?
I believe so, they are already filming!
Who are the new additions?
Jude Law to play young Albus Dumbledore!
Wow now I'm really looking forward to him.
Me too, he is very talented.
That'll be interesting to see how he plays young Dumbledore.
Right! That won't be easy. Johnny Depp will also be there as Grindelwald.
What?? That's awesome!
I agree, Johnny Depp is stupendous.
I think he is perfect for the role!
Me too, I cannot wait for the sequel.
I'll be counting down the days.
