You ready for the NFL season?
Am I ever! I'm bored with the baseball.
Still rooting for the Packers?
Yup, once a cheesehead, always a cheesehead!
Better you than me. I'm sticking with the Titans.
You just like the QB!
Of course! Marcus Mariota is cute and he is from Hawaii!!
He plays decent though.
Better than decent and he is still young!
But didn't he get hurt last season?
Yeah, toward the end of the season. He broke his leg, but he'll be ready for the season.
I hope so, for your sake.
I am not crazy about the team color though...
It's like baby blue, isn't it?
Yeah, doesn't look intimidating enough...haha!
Mariota doesn't look intimidating enough!
True, he is too cute!
Dan Marino was cute and he played well.
You see? Cute is a good thing in QB!
Ha! If you say so! Still I think Packs will beat you any day!
