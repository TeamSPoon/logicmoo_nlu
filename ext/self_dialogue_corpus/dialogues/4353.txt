Have you seen the new thriller action movie John Wick 2?
I have seen it. Great movie.
What was your favorite part?
I liked the scene when they shooting in the tunnel.
It was so cool how he hid all those guns in the tunnel.
I know. When I first saw him hiding them I was wondering why.
I think those people would have hearing damage shooting in such a small area.
It's a movie we aren't supposed to worry about the details.
It was a very cool scene just bothered me that no one seemed to be affected by the noise.
True that many guns being shot would really hurt and damage the ears.
