Who is your favorite Disney princess?
Hmm...that's a tough one.  I like a lot of them.
But if you had to pick a favorite?  Who would it be?
I guess Jasmine.
Why Jasmine?
I don't know.  She's different from the other princesses.  She's more exotic.
Yeah, she's pretty.  Aladdin is a good movie.
I agree.  I like the magic carpet.
The carpet is cool, but I loved the genie.  Robin Williams did his voice.
That's right!  The genie was awesome!  So funny!
