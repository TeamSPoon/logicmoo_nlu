I used to have some respect for disney.
Oh, tell me about it, these live action remakes are soul killing.
Beauty and the beast was just awful.
I really hope they quit this trend.
You know they wont.
Yeah, I shouldnt hold my breath.
I hope they at least leave mulan alone.
Oh man that was my favorite movie!
They are going to ruin it for sure.
I just can't deal.
