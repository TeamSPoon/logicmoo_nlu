Hi.
Hi there.
What's going on?
Not much you?
Same.  What was the last band you saw?
Like live?
Yeah live.
I saw U2 a few years back.
Oh wow.  I hear they put on a great show.
Yes they do, it was incredible.
Did they play for a long time?
Yeah they must have played for about three hours.
Wow.  Did they play all the hits?
Yeah most of them, I didn't get to hear my favorite song though.
Oh no?  What song?
When love comes to town.
Oh I don't know if I know that one.
It was one of their 90s songs.
I see.
Yeah.
