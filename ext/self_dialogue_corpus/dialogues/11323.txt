Why do you think John Lennon is a hypocrite?
He talks about no religion in the song Imagine,yet he was fascinated by it.
How so?
His Beatles are more popular than Jesus quote is the first example.
Well, that doesn't prove anything.
If you put that with him going to learn about more religion in India it adds up.
Still doesn't mean he is a hypocrite.
Add the line no possessions in Imagine with John being very rich it does.
Wow! Your narrative is totally different than the mainstream media`s.
Yep,because I tell the truth.
