I can't believe football will be starting soon!
I know, preseason starts in about a month.
Are you excited?
Sort of. My team won't be that good this year.
Who's your team?
I'm a NY Jets fan, but they released most of their players.
Oh yeah, I heard Eric Decker left?
Yeah, so did Nick Mangold and Darelle Revis.
Wow, that's terrible. Where did Decker go to?
Decker went to the Titains.
Wow, he's a good player though.
Yeah, I hope he gets alot of playing time.
He should, they're first game is against Oakland.
Oakland did well last year!
Yeah, they were 12-4 I think?
The Chiefs were too!
They'll do well this year too.
I wonder how the Giants will do, they did so well a few years ago.
Yeah, because they had a Manning brother.
Yeah, both of them are pretty talented.
