What do you think is the scariest Disney moment?
When Simba's dad died was more sad than scary.
Yeah, that's a memorable moment though.
I'm tempted to mention The Jungle Book. I was so terrified of that tiger.
Oh, yeah! Shere Khan.
He was even scarier in the "live-action" remake.
Oh, I think the torch mob in Beauty and the Beast is scary too.
And the mob in the Hunchback of Notre Dame is terrifying.
Wow, Disney loves a mob carrying torches.
Wow, true. I've never noticed that before.
