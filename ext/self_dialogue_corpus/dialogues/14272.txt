Hey, when is the Final Four?
It's next week, and I can't wait!
I think the Kentucky Wildcats are going make it all the way.
Well, I feel the Cincinnati Bearcats haveva chance as well.
I was shocked at how well Cincinnati has played the past few games.
That's why they've been my team for years.
They may be good, but Kentucky is a national power house.
I don't think Kentucky will get past Kansas.
Really? Kansas is on a down slide with injuries.
I forgot about that, but they still haveva great coach.
Speaking of coaches. John Calipari may be the best ever.
I feel he breaks the rules alot.
He has put two schools on probation.
But, don't get me wrong I'd play for him.
He's put so many players in the NBA it's ridiculous.
But, those kids never get an education.
Those kids will be rich beyond their wildest dreams.
But, also dumber than a box of rocks..
You got a point, but I'd rather be rich and dumb, than smart and broke.
Ok, the game's about to start, go CATS!
