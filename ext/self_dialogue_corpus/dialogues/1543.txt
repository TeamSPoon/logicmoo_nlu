Football season is here are you excited as I am?
Oh yes...I've been waiting since January.I know my Atlanta Falcon's "Dirty Birds" will win the Superbowl this year.
Only in your dreams my friend, they don't stand a chance against the Saints!
Please we have dominated the Saints for the past two years! Who Dat! They're nobody.
That's what your hoping, but the Saints will run over the Falcons like a Mack truck.
Not with the Matt Ryan and Julio Jones on the field think again.
Matt Ryan? He was a one time show not again.
Man you crazy, the Saints have no answer for us!
The Falcon's have no room to talk when they let the Patriots come back in the SuperBowl to win the Championship.
Frankly, I think the game was fixed.
Come on brother, the Falcons got clipped.
We all know that The Patriots have have been known to do shady stuff to get a win. Did anyone check the balls?
Oh my God, that was a low blow even for you, this may have been the first season they did not cheat.
That's what you think once a cheater always a cheater. Belichick and Brady are like Bonnie and Clyde.Sad!
Well, I can agree with that they are shady. Two Championships won, but will always be in question.
I know the Falcons all year have always taken the lead in games and then in the second half they go cold as hell, but they played that whole game with heart.
Sure they did, that is why the Patriots won.
At least we made it to the SuperBowl, where were the Saints?
We under performed last season which happens sometimes with many teams. The important thing is how you rebound and the Saints will watch and learn.
Your right, watch how we roll this year, through the Saints and all our opponents. "Dirty Birds" Fly Falcon's Baby!
