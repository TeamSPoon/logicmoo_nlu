Who is your favirote actor?
That is a really hard question!
Mine is Ryan Gossling.
I loved him in The Notebook!
I did to, it was such a romantic movie.
He has been in some really good movies in his career.
I recently watched Nice Guys and really enjoyed it.
Is that the one where he plays a private detective?
Yes, and he is tracking a mysterious girl throughout it.
Have you ever seen Fracture?
Is that the one with Anthony Hopkins?
It sure is; it was a fantastic film.
Speaking of Anthony Hopkins, I have always loved his work as well.
Me and you both. I love the Silence Of The Lambs franchise.
Those movies were beyond creepy!
I thought he was awesome playing such a creepy role.
It seemed to come so naturally for him.
Have you watched his new movie Solace?
No, was it any good?
I really enjoyed it! He was great in it as usual.
