Do you like music by the Beatles?
I really do, especially their music after their album "Revolver".
What album after "Revolver" is your favorite?
My favorite album is "Sargent Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band", however "Abby Road" is a close second.
Abbey Road is one of my favorites. I really enjoyed the song "Here Comes the Sun".
I like that song, especially since George Harrison sang it.
Is George Harrison your favorite Beatle?
I don't really have a favorite as they were all so talented. I do like George Harrison's guitar work.
What about the guitar work in "The End"? I understand George, Paul McCartney, and John Lennon played each of the three sets of solos in that song.
I did like the guitar work but the best part of that song are the lyrics at the end. "And in the end, the love you take is equal to the love you make".
