I really enjoy Jackson, Russell and Leigh.  Great actors!
They sure are and some of my favorites.
You really need to see this movie.
I have been busy, but should have time next week.
I am sure you will enjoy the movie.
Well, I definitely like action movies, so I definitely plan to go.
You will need to let me know how you like this movie.
Oh, I will do that sor sure.
I would like to see the movie again; it was that good.
Do you want to go with me next week?
Oh, that sounds great!  Just let me know what day/
I will do that; I will know by Friday what day I will be able to go.
Alright, let me know and I will plan to go with you.
I will call you Friday morning; plan for me to pick you up.
OK.  I will talk to you then.
How about me picking you up at five in the evening Wednesday?
Great time for me!  I will see you then.
I am so excited to be seeing "Hateful Eight" and thanks for telling me about this movie and how good it was.
Sure, I just hope you will enjoy it as much as I did the first time, but I am sure you will.
What a movie!  "Tarantino" was one of the best movies I have seen in a long time.
