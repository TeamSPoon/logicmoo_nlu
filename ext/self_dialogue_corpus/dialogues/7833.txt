I think I have watched all the Harry Potter films at least ten times each.
What is your favorite one.
I like all of them but I have to say Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's stone is my favorite.
Why do you like that one so much?
Harry is so young and naive in it, yet he still knows what he wants in life.
Do you like the way he shows up Malfoy, when he tries to get Harry to join the Slytherin House?
Yes, and I love when the Sorting Hat is not sure what house to put Harry into.
In the later episodes, Dumbledore does tell Harry that it could have gone either way?
I know. I think it shows that if Harry had wanted to be evil instead of good, it was that moment that the choice was made
One seemingly small choice at the time. It kind of was what started Harry on the path he took.
