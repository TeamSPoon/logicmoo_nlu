If you could see one band in concert, who would it be? It can be now or the past.
Wow..That is a hard question to narrow down to one band.
What about a band still playing?
I would probably choose AC/DC because I had a chance to see them in concert, but something came up and I couldn't go.
I've heard they put on a great show live.
We ought to look up their schedule and plan a road trip. Who is the band you would like to see?
I always wanted to see Aerosmith. Tyler is a great showman.
I saw them years ago and they were incredible. I didn't want it to end.
I would love to take a month or so and see as many concerts as possible.
What a great idea. Let's start with AC/DC and Aerosmith and go from there.
