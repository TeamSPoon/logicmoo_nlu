My wife is trying to get me to start listening to christian music.
Is that her favorite type of music to listen to?
Yea, she has been listening to it for a very long time.
I actually listen to a few christian bands and they are pretty good in my opinion.
Really? Can you give me some suggestions?
Sure, you should listen to the Casting Crowns and Skillet.
I like those names, what kind of style do they have?
They are christian rock bands, and both of them have some really good songs.
I will give them both a shot. Can you recommend some songs for me?
Sure, Casting Crowns have a great song called Set Me Free. It is really good.
I will write these down and look them up and listen after while.
Also look for a song called Voice Of Truth.
Great, and what about for Skillet?
They have several great songs that I think you will get into.
I sure hope so for my wife's sake!
Listen to Monsters, Hero, and Whispers In The Dark.
Got it, I will definitely look these up and give them an honest listen.
Skillet rocks very hard, yet displays their passion for Jesus Christ and gets their message across.
Thank you for recommending some christian music to me that I may be able to enjoy.
No problem! I just hope you like the songs that I suggested.
