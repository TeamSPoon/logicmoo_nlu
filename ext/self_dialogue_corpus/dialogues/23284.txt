So, have you seen any movies lately at the dollar theater?
Yes!  I just went to see The Circle the other day.
How was it?  I heard it was pretty good.
Yes, it was amazing.  I loved it.
So it was supposed to be a thriller, was it scary?
No, in fact I was laughing a bit and some other people were laughing too.  Tom Hanks did the "tech pioneer demagogue" thing very well!
I can see how that would be funny, those guys are entertaining.  How was it not scary though?
Basically only one tragic thing happened, and the guy who it happened to wasn't a major character.
Wow, so what happened to him?
He died.  So that was the one tragic thing that happened in the whole movie.
Well.  So we know it had a happy ending because it was a thriller instead of horror, so I guess it was just a good movie in general.
Exactly.  The 'bad' guys weren't that scary and it had a very good ending.
So what else about that movie?  I think I'm going to try to convince my girlfriend to see it with me since she lives near that theater.
Good idea.  It seems like the movie is about social networking and lack of privacy, and about how that is actually a good thing!
Wow, sort of flies in the face of Snowden.
Exactly.  They say if you're being watched, then you're going to behave better, and that secrets are lies.
It's kind of like movies are about issues that are going on in society and then they make a statement about it.
Yeah, or sometimes they base a movie on things that are going on, but it's a bad thing, like Skynet in the Terminator movies.
Exactly, but in this case it's a positive thing, they aren't trying to scare people.
Yes, and the key is that everyone is watching, not just a bad guy or a pervert who stalks someone.
