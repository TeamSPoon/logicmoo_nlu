Would you consider Fred Durst a rapper?
I mean I guess you could say he was
He doesnt do it anymore?
I havent heard anything from him
How about Kid Rock?
At one point he was.
And ICP?
Yeah they are a hip hop or rap group. Not very good though.
I think the makeup looks silly to be honest.
It looks like trash!
