What is the best part about The Empire Strikes Back?
I think that the Hoth battle is one of the most exciting parts.
Did you know that Frank Oz did the voice of Yoda in that movie?
Yes!  Yoda is one of the most powerful characters ever written into a movie.
Do you think that Yoda will make an appearance in The Last Jedi?
I don't know - I hope so - maybe as a Force Ghost?
Yeah, I wonder if Obi-wan's voice will be used when Luke and Rey are on Ahch-To.
The trailer when then showed Ahch-To and Rey using her lightsaber was spectacular!
Yeah, just can't wait - I'm curious to see how it all fits into Episode IX.
I hope that the ending of the final episode with Luke, Kylo, Rey, and Snoke is epic.
