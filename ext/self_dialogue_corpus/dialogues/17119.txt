Hey, you have to check out this new group I just discovered!
Oh yeah? What group?
Have you ever heard of Die Antwoord?
Can't say that I have. What genre of music do they do?
It's a weird fusion called zef.
Zef? I've never heard of that. Are you sure you're not just making up words here?
No, I'm serious. They are a South African duo. And zef is basically a blend of dance rave music and rap.
South African? How did you ever find out about these guys? You don't usually listen to foreign music.
Someone showed me one of their music videos. At first, I was into it because the video was so trippy, but then I just thought the music was so catchy I wanted to hear more.
Interesting, but to be honest I'm not a big fan of rap music.
But you do like dance music right?
Of course I do. I used to go to the Electric Daisy Carnival every year.
Well then you should still definitely give Die Antwoord a listen. Like I said, they're actually a fusion of rave music with rap.
Fine, if it'll get you to stop pestering me, I'll have a listen when I get a chance.
Great! That's all I wanted.
What track would you recommend I listen to?
Well you are a fan of Aphex Twin, right?
Yes. So?
Then listen to "Ugly Boy." The music from that is sampled from Aphex Twin's "Ageispolis."
Really? Okay, I'll give that a try then.
