I absolutely adore Star Wars.
Me, too! But I'm only into the first three.
Do you mean Episode 1, 2 and 3? Or do you mean the original Star Wars?
I mean the original. I don't quite understand Lucas's story organization.
Well the originals really were the classics.
Exactly, before they added all those annoying characters like Jar Jar Binks.
Did you get the re-releases on DVD?
I have them, but I gotta say that I love my original VHS tapes.
Really? Why is that?
Because they have the original special effects as opposed to the new ones.
