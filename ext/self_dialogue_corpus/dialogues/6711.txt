Do you think people still like Fantasia?
I dont know anyone who did like it.
It was a huge hit
Yeah but for what reasons
Probably because Mickey was in it.
I think the acting was good.
There was no acting!
True, the story was just about music.
Yeah the animations were phenomenal though.
This is true, but I dont get its allure.
