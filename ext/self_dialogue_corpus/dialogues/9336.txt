Have you heard Chance the Rapper?
Of course I know Chance the Rapper man. I don't live under a rock.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I figured.
Chance 3 was my favorite album last year.
Same. It was my favorite album overall and a big departure for him.
Yeah, it was more Gospel sounding, had a lot of features, and was way more produced.
I still really liked it despite the features and high production not sounding great on paper.
I love that he has such a positive message.
Yeah, have you heard his brother's music?
Yeah, his brothers name is Taylor Bennett, right? I've heard his collaboration with Kweku Collins called Vanilla Skies.
