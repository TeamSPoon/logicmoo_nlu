Did you like the new star wars movie Force awakens?
I did but it felt like it was stealing from previous films plots.
I can see where you are coming from but all movies will be loosely based on each other.
I agree. How about Rogue one?
Oh i loved learning of how they got the plans for the Death star.
Yeah even with some of the stories being changed a bit I really liked the story.
Yeah Felicity Jones was perfect in that movie
And seeing darth vader at the end was awesome!
Oh yeah! him just going berzerker on everyone was awesome!
Yep and seeing Carrie Fisher at the end was great
