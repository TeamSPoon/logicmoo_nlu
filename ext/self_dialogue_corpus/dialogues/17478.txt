Do you ever listen to Snoop Dog?
I know who he is, but not much of his music.
His first album is really good.
Wasn't he in NWA back in the day?
Yup! A lot of good rappers were.
Tat's crazy how big they've all become.
Yeah, especially Snoop Dog.
The guy is a legend now.
Isn't he Snoop Lion now or something?
He was but I think he went back to Dog shortly after.
That's good. I like him better that way.
I think he did some Reggae stuff back then.
Did you listen to it much?
Not really. I heard it wasn't awful though.
I can't imagine him doing anything but rap.
Same here. The guy pulls it off though.
He really does. No idea how.
Maybe we should grab his last album.
We should! Let's go check it out.
Alright let's go!
