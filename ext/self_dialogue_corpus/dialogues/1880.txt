Have you been following the NFL in the offseason?
A little. Mainly just until the draft.
The draft had a few surprises.
Some, but I'd say the biggest surprise was Mitchell Trubisky going so high!
I know. I would've thought Deshaun Watson would've been ahead of him for sure.
I know. Watson was the third quarterback chosen.
I didn't expect that at all. I was also a little surprised by Reuben Foster.
Why is that?
Well, he's a great talent obviously, but he left the combine because he got into a fight!
That's right. I forgot about that. Well, sometimes teams are willing to take a chance to get a great player.
That's part of the reason we get such bad role models in sports.
Unfortunately it's about the money usually.
I know, but it seems like if a guy can't even handle a combine he's just going to be a problem.
Well, I think we kind of saw that with Colin Kapernick. He wasn't doing anything bad per se, but he didn't make life easier for his team.
I know. And now he isn't being picked up because of it.
I don't know if that's the whole reason. He really hasn't been that impressive as a quarterback.
True, but combine that with the fact that any team that takes him is going to have to deal with political issues and it doesn't bode well for him.
You are right. At least it hasn't so far.
It'll be interesting to see if he gets back in if someone gets hurt.
I'm not sure which team would be willing to give him a try.
