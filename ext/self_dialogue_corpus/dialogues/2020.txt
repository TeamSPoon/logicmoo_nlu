Do you think Bill Belichick will retire when Brady does?
It's hard to say. I'm sure Belichick has a ton of respect for Brady, but he is really a next man up kind of guy.
I know that's what he says but he and Brady have been together for years now. Don't you think it's a little different with him?
I would assume so, but you never know with Bill. He's very much a business, not personal, kind of guy.
I know, but with the success they've had together I think it'd be hard to have one without the other going forward.
It would be strange for sure, but I could see him continuing.
Well, then that brings up the question, how much longer do you think Brady has?
I don't know but I can't see him being a Brett Favre. He has too much respect for the game.
What do you mean?
Well, Brett Favre was an amazing quarterback, but he decided to come back and he just wasn't in his prime.
Oh I see. Yeah, I can't see Brady playing if he's not 100%.
Me neither. But as long as he feels good and is playing well, who knows how long he will go!
How old is the oldest quarterback to play?
I think there were a handful to play at 44, almost 45, but not many.
And how old is Brady?
He will be 40 in August, so he'd have to hold out for a few more years to beat that record.
Do you think he will try?
I honestly don't think he cares about being the oldest, I think he just still really likes the game.
The key will be not getting hurt.
Yes. At that age, knees can be a major issue.
