Did you ever see Andromeda Strain?
No. What is that?
It's a movie based on the Michael Crichton book.
Michael Crichton?
You know, Jurrassic Park, The Sphere...
I know Jurrasic Park, but I didn't know it was a book.
It is. A really good one.
Better than the movie.
Of course! Aren't they all?
I don't know. Not much of a reader.
I was just curious about Andromeda Strain. It came out in the 70's.
Wow. Crichton's had quite a career.
Indeed. A lot of his books become movies.
Well, I'm no help to you there.
No worries.
Was Andromeda Strain good.
I hardly rember the book, but I saw the movie online and was curious.
Well let me know if you watch it.
Will do. Probably this weekend.
Cool. Let me know.
