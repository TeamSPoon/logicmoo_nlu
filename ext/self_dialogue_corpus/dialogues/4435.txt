Do you like thriller movies, and if so which ones?
I really liked that movie Disturbia with Shia in it.
Oh, I remember that one, with the neighbor who turned out to be a killer.
Yeah, that movie had me on the edge of my seat the whole time.
It was pretty good, I really liked Inception.
That is a good movie, but do you really think it is a thriller?
Yeah I do, a lot of that movie had my heart beating fast, I was on the edge of my seat.
Inception is one of the best movies of our time.
I agree, pretty much anything Christopher Nolan does is great!
Yeah, another great thriller by him is Memento.
