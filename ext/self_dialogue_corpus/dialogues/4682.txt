Did the Mets play last night?
Yup, they did.
Nice. Who did they play?
The Dodgers.
Nice. Did they win?
Yup, they did.
Do you mind telling me the score?
Five to Two. Was closer than the score showed though.
So it was a good game?
Yea, went right down to the final at bats.
Nice. Are they playing again today?
They are, at noon I think.
Awesome, you want to watch the game somewhere?
I would, I hear they show all the ballgames at Rue's Pub
Oh, I've been there before. I saw the A's beat the Rays at that bar.
Really? I was there at that game too!
Nice. That walk-off home run was amazing right?
It was, I spilled my beer.
Ok, were going then!
Alright, game starts at seven.
