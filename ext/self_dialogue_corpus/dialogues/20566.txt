Are you looking forward to seeing any movies this summer?
I want to see Wonder Woman.
I heard it's supposed to be really good.
I heard the same thing. That's partly why I want to see it.
Do you have any idea what it's supposed to be about?
I heard it goes into Wonder Woman's Amazon origins.
Doesn't it take place during World War I?
Apparently it's set in 1918.
I want to see the Mummy.
Oh, yes. There's one with Tom Cruise now.
Why? Was there another The Mummy movie?
Yes. There's a whole trilogy actually.
Really? Who was in them?
Brendan Fraser! Didn't you know that?
I'm not sure. When were the movies out in theatres?
The Mummy came out in 1999. The Mummy Returns came out in 2001.
Oh. That was a while ago.
True. Then the third one came out in 2008.
Which one was that?
Tomb of the Dragon Emporer, I believe.
