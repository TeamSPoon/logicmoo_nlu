My favorite song was "Let it Go".
My daughter loves that song and sings it all the time.
Do you get tired of hearing her sing it?
No, I like that she enjoys emulating wholesome characters like Elsa and Anna.
My son's favorite Character is Olaf.
I am sure he will play a large role in the upcoming movie.
Do you think you will take your kids to see it in theaters when it comes out?
Definitely, We always go see the new Disney movies.
I will probably wait until it comes out on Netflix.
We love that Netflix carries several of Disney's movies.
