So you're saying Kanye West is an egomaniac?
Are you saying he's not? Have you gone deaf and blind? I mean I'll admit he's made some great albums.
Did you just say "albums"? Are you the last person on earth who doesn't DJ but still uses that word?
Hey, don't get mad at me because I have an appreciation for the classics.
I think you mean "ancients". You gonna pull out your Victrola too? And later on go see one of those talking picture shows?
Dude. Now you're avoiding the Kanye Concession. I know this little game.
What?
You're about to have to admit that he's more conceited than he is talented. And ever since "808s  and Heartbreaks" you've been very sensitive about him.
He's got a kind soul, I can just tell. "Heartless" is a timeless classic and absolutely pure of spirit.
I beg to differ. Nothing is pure after that much auto-tune.
