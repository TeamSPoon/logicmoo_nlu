I have a question about Peter Pan the movie.
Go for it.
What is the physics behind pixie dust?
You mean how does it work?
Yeah, like how does a physical material give one weightlessness in order to fly?
Bro, you're asking the wrong person here. I failed physics.
And Tinker Bell. That pixie dust just keeps coming off of her forever!
Yeah, so what?
It never runs out! How is that possible?
I think it's time we watch that movie again and find out.
