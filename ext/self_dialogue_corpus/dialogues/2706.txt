How old were you when you started watching football.
Probably while I was still in my mom's belly.
Were you parents big NFL fans?
I would definitely say so since we had four TV going every Sunday simultaneously.
Was just your dad a fan or did your mom like football too?
It was both of them.
Did they like the same teams?
No way. It did not matter whether it was college or NFL football they seemed to like the biggest rival of each others teams.
Who did they root for?
My mom was and Eagles Fan and do you know who their biggest rival is?
No who?
Dallas Cowboys which happens to be my dads team.
And which one of those do you root for?
I do not like either team.
Then who is your home team?
I root for Denver.
Why don't you root for the Eagles?
I don't like the coaching staff and the way they run their team.
And why don't you like Dallas?
Because I can't stand Tony Romo as a person or player and Jerry Jones is a bully and a cheat.
