So what happened with the dream team?
What do you mean? What happened with it?
I guess I mean why was it such a big deal?
Oh. it was a big deal because it was the first time professional athletes were allowed to compete in the Olympics.
That kinda goes against the spirit of the olympics.
Says the losers.
No. The Olympics has always been a forum for dedicated amateur athletes.
Says the losers. And no, Olympic athletes have national, corporate, and other supports. How is a professional athlete any different. they just make money
Anyway the dream team.
Ahh yes, the dream team. They won every game by an average of 44 points over their opponents. an din the finals they beat Croatia by 117 to 85.
That seems reasonable seeing as how they're pros
Yep. In the 1988 Olyimpics, we only took 3rd place, because we sent in college kids. To play against national teams from all over the world. Now that's what's unfair.
Well our national team made up of college kids still got the support they needed, I bet.
Sure.
So it WAS fair.
No it wasn't, Because we weren't allowed to send in our best.
So... Unless you send in your best, it's not fair for you. Is that it?
That's exactly how it is.
So who was the best player on the team?
So get this, Michael Jordan, Charles Barkley, Larry Byrd, Patrick Ewing, Scotty PIppen, Clyde Dexter, Christian Laettner, Chris Mullens, Karl Malone, And David Robinson all played 8 games. of all of them Barkley had the highest FGM stat at 59. HIs percentage was the highest too. 0.711.
