Do you think the saints will bounce back this year?
It's always possible with drew breese at quarterback.
Yes,he's still a top quarterback.
Yes he is.
Maybe the addition of Adrian Peterson will help him too.
If he has anything left.
I think staying healthy is a question mark for him too.
To many knee injuries.
Yes,and a lot of carries under his belt too.
That's for sure.
They addressed the defense somewhat.
They missed out on Reuben Foster though.
Good move by the 49ers to move up and grab him.
That was a very good move.
They should score a lot as usual with breese at qb and Sean Peyton still the head coach.
The NFC south should be competitive.
I agree.
The saints need to get that home field advantage back.
Yes,they need that dome dominance again.
Yes they do.
