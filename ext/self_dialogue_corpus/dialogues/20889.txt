I haven't seen a good movie in such a long time.
I can make some suggestions if you'd like.
What have you seen lately?
I recently saw Now You See Me 2.
I saw the first one when it came out back in 2013. Was the second one better?
I'd have to say it was a little better. They basically took what made the first movie so great and multiplied it.
That sounds incredible. I remember Morgan Freeman, Jesse Eisenberg, and Dave Franco were in the first one.
They are also in the second one. A new actress in the sequel is Lizzy Caplan.
I know her from The Interview! She is a beautiful actress!
She does a great job in this movie.
I will definitely have to see this especially since Lizzie is in the new one!
Let me know what you think of it. Have you heard of Masterminds yet?
I know that Zach Galifianakis is in it so it must be good.
Yeah he is a funny but odd guy. He fits in great in this movie.
That is good to know. I definitely have to see it.
Zach and Kristen Wiig have great chemistry in it.
She is a wonderful actress as well!
Yes she is and very pretty.
I started out today not knowing any movies to see and now I have two that I really want to see!
Glad I could help. Enjoy the movies!
