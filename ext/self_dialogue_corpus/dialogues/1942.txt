Are you doing fantasy football this season?
I'm not sure, are you running your league?
I think so, its take up time but people do like it.
Yeah, it is fun.
Do you think the Patriots are going to be on top again this season?
I don't know, Brady seems to be still on his game.
I know, I hope someone in the AFC can challenge this season they way the falcons did last season.
I know, I was really pulling for Ryan last year.
Yeah, me too.
I just don't like the Patriots but can't argue with their success.
I know but I still think they cheat some.
It is strange everything that happens in that stadium.
I know, how funny the issues that happen for opposing teams.
I know, strange isn't it.
I do think deflategate was a little ridiculous.
Yeah, me too but if you have a history of cheating, people look really closely.
This is true.
But it was a little ridiculous.
Godell is just such a clown.
I know.
