Have you watched any movies on Netflix recently?
Actually, I have! We watched "Trolls" last week.
"Trolls"?!? The animated movie?
Yes, it was cute!
Isn't that a child's movie?
We watched it while my husband's parents were in town. No kids either!
Was it any good?
I like it! There were some funny jokes, and it had a great message.
It looks like the visual colors and animation of it are very appealing.
Yes, the colors are bright, and I'm sure it engages kids who watch it.
Wasn't Justin Timberlake in it?
Yes, he did the voice of one of the main characters. There are a ton of famous actors in it.
Really? Who else?
Anna Kendrick, Zooey Deschanel, Russell Brand, Gwen Stefani, and James Corden are all in it.
Wow! That's a lot of big names for an animated movie!
I'm sure there are others too that I just did not pick up on.
Cool. I may have to give it a try.
You should. I mean, if you don't like it at least you didn't pay anything extra if you stream it from Netflix.
Good point.
I think you'll be suprised though, and really enjoy it.
