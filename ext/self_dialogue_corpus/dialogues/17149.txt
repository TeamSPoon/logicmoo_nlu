Have you ever heard of Soundgarden? It is a Seattle based rock band.
Yes, didn't they do "Black Hole Sun"?
Yeah, and many more popular songs like Spoonman, Save Yourself, and Outshined.
Oh yeah, they did a lot of cool songs.
The lead singer went on to front Audioslave. They did " I am the highway", Like a Stone", and a few more..
What was the lead singers name, I like his voice.
Chris Cornell. He also did solo stuff, he was quite talented.
What do you mean " he was?"
He is dead, died this year at 52.
Woah! No way, really? What happened, was he sick?
No, I heard on the news that he hung himself after a sold out concert in Detroit.
OMG!! That's messed up, was he on drugs or something?
I don't think so, maybe years ago but I don't think he had a recent problem, but you never know.
You are right about that. It was such a shock how many lost from drugs, such a shame.
Yeah, Music has suffered some horrific loses from drugs and alcohol abuse.
I don't really know but some thing is  wrong, obviously. So many fall into trouble. Was Chris Cornell depressed?
I don't know, maybe. He suffered with depression before I think. I loved Soundgarden and Audioslave.
Yeah, that is a shock, he will be missed.
Oh, yes! I miss him already, he was so talented and sexy.
Hopefully he is at peace....
