Hey! Are you going to watch the NFL this year? Are you excited for camp?
Yes, but I don't know if I will watch much this year. I think it is not as entertaining as it used to be.
Do you think the Patriots will repeat?
They have a strong chance too. The rest of the division is bad which means an automatic trip to the playoffs.
It will be awkward for the Raiders to keep playing in Oakland.
I know. I don't think they'll play the full 3 years there. Maybe they'll play somewhere else or move early.
At least the Raiders are good though. And they have Marshawn Lynch.
Yeah. Carr is getting paid a lot to play this year.
I think the Chargers won't get any fans this year either. LA doesn't need or want a second bad team.
The Rams didn't get a ton of fans either, so I can't imagine this is a slam dunk investment.
Who's your favorite player to watch?
I really like Julio Jones on Atlanta. He's huge and fast. Atlanta should have won the Super Bowl.
Do you think that it's a good idea for Roger Goodell to stay in the commissioner's office with all of his controversies?
I don't think he knows what he's doing, and this Redskins problem isn't going away.
Are you in favor of the team name changing?
Yeah. It's pretty offensive and the history of how it came about is too. Snyder is a terrible owner and Cousins will probably leave after this year.
Is it that bad? Cousins has some talent but he is wild.
The team doesn't treat or engage with him like they should, and it shows. He requested a trade, it's only a matter of time.
Oh well. At least the season starts soon! I'm excited for Marshawn to be back in my life!
It'll be fun to watch at least. I probably won't play fantasy football though. Just enjoy it for what the NFL is.
