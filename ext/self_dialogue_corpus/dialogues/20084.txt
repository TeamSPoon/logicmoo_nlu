Did you see any of the Harry Potter movies?
Are you kidding?  I saw all of them at least twice.
Which one was your favorite?
I think the first one, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone was probably my favorite.
What did you think about Prisoner of Azkaban?
Welll, I liked them all but that was probably my least favorite.
Are there any of the other Young Adult books turned movies that you really liked?
Probably my next favorite series would be Hunger Games.
I thought Jennifer Lawrence was great in those. What other movies of hers have you seen?
A few, and I really liked her in American Hustle.
That was a great movie.  What did you think about Passengers?
Ugh.  I was so looking forward to that but I wasn't a fan.
Me either and I'm a huge Chris Pratt Fan.  Speaking of which have you seen Guardian of the Galaxy 2 yet?
I am going this weekend and I can't wait to see it.
So I take it you were a fan of the first one.
Oh yes, I thought it was great.
Do you think Groot will grow up in this one?
Don't, know, but he's aborable as a little sapling in the previews!
I think my favorite character is Rocket, how about yours.
Now that I'm thinking about it, I think Groot.  He's very different than any movie character I've seen before!
