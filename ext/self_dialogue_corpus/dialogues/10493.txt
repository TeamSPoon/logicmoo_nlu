So what do you plan on doing for winter break this year?
I was thinking about just taking it easy this year. How about you?
I want to take it easy as well. Maybe I'll watch a lot of TV or something.
I love watching Christmas movies.
Me too! I watch Home Alone almost every year.
I love that movie. There are so many good Christmas movies.
Did you ever see that old one that's actually just called "A Christmas Story"?
I love that movie!
Me too. I think it's one of the best ones out there.
Isn't it funny how many different kinds of Christmas movies there are?
What do you mean?
Well, it's like there's different sub-genres of Christmas movies.
Give an example.
Well, we already mentioned two distinct style of Christmas movies. Then there's also movies like Die Hard.
I love that movie. That's another classic.
Then there's also "It's a Wonderful Life"
Ah, yes. I see what you mean.
Jimmy Stewart was great in that movie, by the way.
He was. It's funny when you think about how different that is from more recent Christmas movies.
That's basically my point about all of the different categories, or almost sub-genres, of Christmas movies.
