Hey, guess what movie I just watched?
I have no idea, what was it?
It was the Disney movie The Princess and the Frog, have you seen it?
Oh I remember when that came out, but I never saw it.  Is it good?
It's fantastic!  It totally lives up to its reputation.
What's it about?
It's set in New Orleans and it's about this girl who dreams of being a chef.  She winds up getting turned into a frog along with a wayward prince.
What do you mean, a wayward prince?
He's totally stuck up.  They end up on a journey together through the bayou.
Oh interesting.  Is it funny?
It's absolutely hilarious!  Plus the sound track is great and will totally get stuck in your head.
I had heard that.
Yeah, it's incredible.  I love the Disney princess movies and this is one of the best for sure.
It seems like they just get better and better.  Did you see Tangled?
Yes but I did not like it as much as the Princess and the Frog.
I thought it was pretty good.
It was good but not as good.  This one is funnier, I promise.
Okay, I will have to watch it.
Yeah, and the music is better.  Plus it's got a good moral.
They usually do have good morals.
