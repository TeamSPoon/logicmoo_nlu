Do you know the Oklahoma City Thunder?
I know of them but not specifically, no.
Does Durant still play for them?
No, he's in Oakland now.
Who's in Oakland?
Oh, the Golden State Warriors.
Oh, OK. Do you miss the Supersonics?
Yeah, I miss them in Seattle.
The Thunder moved to OKC from Seattle.
Yes, I know that.
I heard Bill Gates was trying to get another team there, in Seattle.
Yeah, I heard Russell Wilson supporting that too.
Random thought: I still like Lebron.
Me too.
Even after he left Cleveland but before he went back, I still liked him.
Yeah, never understood people who hated him.
Maybe they're too poor to see a real NBA game.
Maybe, or maybe they don't have another NBA team to really like.
Or they're in Minnesota and stuck with the T-Wolves.
That's possibly true too.
