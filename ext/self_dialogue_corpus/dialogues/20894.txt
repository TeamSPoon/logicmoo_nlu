Today has been so boring!
I know, we should watch some movies or something.
Do you have anything good?
I have a lot of movies. Who is your favirote actor?
I have always enjoyed Ashton Kutcher movies.
I have a few of his movies actually.
Which ones do you have?
Have you ever seen Killers?
Yes! I could watch that movie every day!
There is a lot of great action in that film.
What other movies of his do you have?
Have you ever seen The Butterfly Effect?
No, what is that one about?
It is kind of a suspense movie. It has a great plot.
Sounds good, but I am in more of a comedy mood.
I have Dude, Where's My Car?
I have heard great things about that movie.
It will make you laugh for sure!
Sounds good, can not wait to watch it!
I will bring it on over, prepare to laugh!
