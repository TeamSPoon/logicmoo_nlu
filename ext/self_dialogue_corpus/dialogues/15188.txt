I was listening to the classic rock station the other day, great stuff.
I like that station, they play music from the 70s and 80s.
Back in the old days, my favorite band was Led Zeppelin.
Zeppelin four was the best album. Even though it didn't have an actual title!
Plant went on to sing in the honedrippers, but that didn't last.
I know, but Page is still the greatest guitarist ever.
Maybe, I saw Clapton back in 92.  He is considered on of the best.
Yeah. old slow hand was great. He did MTV unplugged.
Nowadays, music isn't the same.  The last group I liked was green day!
Seriously though, there are no great new rock musicians these days.
Now it's pop and hip hop.  All music sounds like Katy Perry.
Although I do like Lady Gagas voice.
She did some great stuff with Tony Bennett.
That was crazy-what a weird pairing that worked.
My kids listen to some hip hop stuff, but they all have weird names.
Well, so did the old groups. I used to listen to Ratt and Red hot chili peppers so it's all good.
That's true.  It was just easier to remember names like Michael Jackson!
and Prince! Wow, so many great ones are gone!
I miss Freddy mercury, let's listen to some Queen!
Ok, Bohemian Rhapsody coming right up!
