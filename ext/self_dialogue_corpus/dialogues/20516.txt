I've been on a drama movie kick lately. What would be your favorite in that genre?
Memoirs of a Geisha, hands down.
Wasn't that a book? Or did they write a book after the movie came out?
It was a book first, written by Arthur Golden.
Wow, he must be super happy about the movie!
I'm not sure, but I'm sure that he made a lot of money off of it.
So it was really good then?
Oh I loved it, but then again I like anything that has to do with Japanese culture.
What was it about?
A very young girl whose family sells her to be a geisha.
Wow, poor girl.
Yeah unfortunately it happened a lot back then.
What else?
She goes through the usual dramatic tribulations, overcoming rivals, winning a love interest, etc.
So, it sounds kind of boring. What is the part that makes it your favorite?
It has a historial feel to it, and then of course it's Japanese history!
Wait, didn't they use mostly Chinese actors though?
That definitely caused quite an uproar!
Well, based on your description I think I'll pass.
Suit yourself, your loss!
