Is the NFL going to have a game or two in England again this year?
I don't know, but I wish they'd stop that.
Why?
It robs one group of fans a home game every year. Some people save up for these games and have less chances to see it.
But it exposes the NFL to other countries.
That's all well and good, but save it for pre-season scrimmages.
That's a great idea!
I know, I should be the commissioner.
You'd have my vote.
Why should a game that counts towards the season be played in another country with a different time zone?
Oh yeah, the time zone.
They're basically playing at 8am, which is ridiculous for eastern teams, but 5am for those on the west coast!
That always bothered me about sports in general: late games for east teams on the west coast, and vice versa.
As commissioner I'd get rid of that.
So, is that your only solution for NFL in Europe?
Yeah, but I love the whole exhibition thing. Maybe take the top CFL team and have them play a team from the NFL.
That'd be a disaster for the CFL.
Not really. They'd get paid a lot, probably, that should help.
They'd lose.
Well...not against the Lions. Ha!
