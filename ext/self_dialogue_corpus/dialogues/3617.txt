Have you seen the movie Dead Silence?
Yes, I loved it. I thought it was very creepy!
I agree, I thought the effect of everything going silent when Mary Shaw was about to attack was an excellent effect.
It was, the poem created a very creepy ambiance as well.
Yes it really did. The twist ending really surprised me as well.
Oh you mean when you found out that Edward was dead all along and Ella was the perfect doll?
Yes, that was a real surprise to me!
Me too! I find ventriloquist dolls very creepy, so it was a good overall premise for the movie.
Yes it was, the scene in the theater when they find all the dolls and Mary Shaw is possessing them is so scary!
Yes it is! Especially the clown doll.
