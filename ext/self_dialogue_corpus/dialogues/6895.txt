Oh my gosh, I can't believe that they are making a Cars 3.
I know I love those movies.
Me too, they are one of my favorite Disney Movies.
I love Mater and the story line is so good. Who is your favorite character.
My favorite is Lightning McQueen.
Ya I like him too. I hope that number 3 lives up to the rest.
Ya number 2 was ok, not as good as number 1 so we will see.
Ya. There is just something very nostalgic about it, even though it is not that old.
Ya, I feel like it takes you back to a simpler time.
Exactly!
