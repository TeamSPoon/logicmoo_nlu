I'm so excited about the next Star Wars movie!
Oh yeah! What's this one called again?
It's episode 8 and it's called The Last Jedi!
Is Luke Skywalker supposed to be in it more this time?
Oh yeah. He's is shown in the trailer training and teaching Rey.
Are all the other characters from The Force Awakens supposed to be back?
Poe, Finn, BB-8, Phasma, Kylo, and so more are all in the trailer plus some new faces.
I wonder if we will find out why Luke was on that island.
I bet we will. The teaser trailer shows Rey exploring some ancient Jedi texts.
It sounds like they are going in to the unexplored history of the Jedi.
