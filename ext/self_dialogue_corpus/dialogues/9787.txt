Are you ready for that new Jay-Z album?
Of course I am! You?
Yes, but man is getting old.
Hov is a genius, old age is wisdom gained for him.
I just hope Hov doesn't come through with that Uzi flow.
Yeah, he's too old for that!
Plus I heard that No ID is producing the whole thing.
Oh wow, that's dope!
Yes, so we should be in good hands!
No ID wouldn't steer Hov in the wrong direction.
