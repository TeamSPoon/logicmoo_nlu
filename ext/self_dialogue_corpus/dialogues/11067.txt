Are there any professional ice hockey teams near you?
Yes,ice hockey is a very popular game in Canada.
Who is your favourite team?
My favourite team is he Vancouver Canucks.
Oh, I've heard of them before.
Yes, they are very popular in my hometown.
How often do you go see a game?
Unfortunately, I don't get to go as often as I would like.
Why not?
The lack of time and cost of tickets are two issues that I have with attending a game.
I would like to see a professional ice hockey team play someday.  I bet it is really exciting to watch in person.
Absolutely!  Seeing a game in person is much better than on the TV.
Really, why?
In person the energy of the players and the crowd can really be felt.
Oh, I'm sure that make for a fun experience.
Yes, it is great. If you are really lucky a hockey puck might even fly into the crowd.
Wow, that would be very cool.
Yes, it is.
Thanks for telling me so much about the sport.  I think I definitely need to see the game in live action.
Certainly.  It will surely be a good time.
