Do you listen to the Foo Fighters often?
Not really, but they are a good band.
Dave Grohl is really underrated as a musician.
What do you mean?
I mean, he was in one of the biggest bands of all time and he's still making music.
Oh, you mean Nirvana?
Yeah.  I'm surprised that Foo Fighters aren't bigger than they are.
How would you top Nirvana though?
Did you know that Grohl was the drummer for Nirvana?
Yeah.  I wonder if he knew how to play the guitar back then.
