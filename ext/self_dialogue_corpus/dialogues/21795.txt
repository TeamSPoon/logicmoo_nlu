I have been trying to get into classic films.
How is that going for you?
I do not even know where to start to be honest.
Well, it depend what kind of films you like.
I like them all, especially comedies.
Then you should start in the golden age, something like "His Girl Friday".
Is is funny?
It is, but also a romance. One of the best rom-coms ever made.
Are there any classic comedies that are a bit raunchy?
Blazing Saddles is my top pick.
A Western?
Yes, but a classic comedy too. Has Gene Wilder.
I have heard of him.
He is the all time best for funny classics.
What else did he do?
He was the guy from the original Willy Wonka.
That was him?
Yes. He also did one called the Frisco Kid.
Another Western?
Yes, but again funny. He also did some stuff with Richard Pryor.
