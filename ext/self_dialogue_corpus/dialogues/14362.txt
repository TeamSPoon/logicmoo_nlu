Hey man how is the game going today?
Things are not going the best to be honest?
Why not?
The teams down by five and the second half is almost over
Sounds pretty stressful
It is im nervous about the loss
Why are you nervous about losing?
Because I bought some tickets to a bet.
So you would lose them if you lost the game?
Yeah and if I win I get double tickets so I'm on the edge of my seat.
Gotta have faith in your team it's only five points
You are correct just slightly nervous you get me
Yeah I get you but hopefully they score again
They got the ball now so I'm hoping so
Their you go!
Yeah I should trust your basket ball judgment.
I am good at betting on basket ball for a reason
I know you do it a lot.
Next time ask me before you do it so I can advise you
I will do that for sure
