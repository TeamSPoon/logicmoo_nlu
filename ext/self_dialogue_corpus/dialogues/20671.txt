Did you see Snatched yet?
No. Is that the new Goldie Hawn movie?
Yes, and Amy Schumer.
I don't like her too much, but I love Goldie. Did you see it?
Yes, it was hysterical.
I have a coupon for a free DVD at Best Buy. Maybe I'll get it.
You'll like it!
Goldie is always fun to watch. I just watched an old one called $ that was really good.
Was that with Warren Beatty in a bank?
Yes. They rob safe deposit boxes.
I think I saw it. They have this whole elaborate scheme and get locked in the vault, right?
Yes, that's it. Really funny one from back then.
How old is it?
It's from the seventies.
I didn't know it was that old.
Yes, it was from the same era as Girl In My Soup and Shampoo.
Girl In My Soup? Is that a movie?
Yes, with Peter Sellers and another cute actress named Diana Dors.
Oh I remember her. She was married to Richard Dawson.
She was a good actress but really underrated.
