Do you remember the scene from the first Fast & Furious in the Tran's garage?
I'm not sure if I do.
When Brian was looking for the stolen stuff from the truck robberies?
Oh right, when he almost got found out by Dom.
Yeah, the scene with the mechanic is what I mean specifically.
Oh when he's watching the guy get tortured.
Yeah that's it, it took me so long to figure out what he Tran was talking about when he asked 40 weight or 50 weight.
Are you for real right now?
Yes I know now, but I completely spaced about oil viscosities when I was watching it the first few times.
I think I'm gonna find a new mechanic, no offense.
