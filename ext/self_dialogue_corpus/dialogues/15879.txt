I can't wait until Nok from the Future goes on tour again.
What is a Nok from the Future?
He's only the best producer-turned-artist to come out of the internet in recent years.
Is he another silly soundcloud rapper?
Not at all. His music is of extremely high quality.
What is it like?
It incorporates elements from a number of different genres, beautiful melodies, and hard hitting drums.
Sounds interesting ... where is he from?
Who knows... his identity is hidden. He wants people to focus on the art; even his music videos are dope.
Is he signed to a label?
No, everything is DIY; he oversees the creativity of everything he does. He's a very talented guy.
Does he have any albums out?
He has an album called BOMBS 1, and he has an EP called A+.
He seems pretty new to the scene.
He doesn't release music too frequently, but when he does, it is fire. He is definitely from the future because even his releases from years ago don't sound dated.
He's the guy with the chrome mask? I've seen you liking his pictures on the Instagram.
Yes, that's him. He also makes really cool, high quality, well designed merch, like that green Wafalo Wafalo shirt I have.
That shirt is so cool. I wish I was a fan so I could have bought one!
I think he might be German because he collaborates with some big German artists here.
Germany is always at the top of design and engineering so I wouldn't be surprised.
