What did you think of the movie Power Rangers?
I felt like it was terrible. I don't understand why people enjoyed it so much.
I feel like the action scenes in Power Rangers were too generic.
They were too generic and also it seemed like the movie was trying too hard to be Politically Correct.
I did like seeing some background information on the character Rita Repulsa though.
It was interesting to find out she was once a Green Ranger.
Do you think they will make a Power Rangers Two?
Maybe. I am not sure though if I would go see it.
What did you think of  the fighting style of the Power Rangers?
It was alright but it could of been better with more believable action scenes.
