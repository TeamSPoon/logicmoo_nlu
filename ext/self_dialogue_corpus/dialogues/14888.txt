Hey bud, have you seen elf?
Oh no,  I can't watch will Ferrell movies.
Oh ok,  well who's your favorite comedy actor then?
Probably paul Rudd, he's so dry sometimes it can be hilarious!
Yeah he's great,  I loved him in role models.
That movie was awesome! The little kid was so funny.
Yeah,  and did you know that the laire kid was also in super bad?
Oh yeah,  that's right,  he was mclovin! I had forgotten that.
We should totally watch superbad tonight.
