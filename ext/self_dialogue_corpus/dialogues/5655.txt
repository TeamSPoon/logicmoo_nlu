What disney movies do you remember as a kid?
I remember when the Rescuers came out.
The Rescuers? I am not sure I remember that one.
It was great! It was about these Rescue Aid Society that helped abducted victims around the world.
Who were the characters?
Miss Bianca recruits Bernard, both of which are mice, to rescue Penny, a little orphan girl from the mean and devious Madam Medusa, a treasure hunter from Paris.
So these mice go rescue a girl from a madwoman?
Well it is a bit more detailed than that. The enlist the help of an albatross named Orville and a dragonfly named Evinrude to help them.
I have never seen this movie.
You must get it! It is one of the forgotten ones.
