Is it true that Lady Gaga write's her own music?
I think it is.
Wow, she really is amazing!
Yeah, she's a very talented artist
I wonder why she dresses so crazy when she attends award shows
I think it's to show off her personality and stand out
She seems like a good role model for young women
Yeah, I think she stays out of trouble well.
She must have a really busy life.
It seems that way, always travelling and writing music.
