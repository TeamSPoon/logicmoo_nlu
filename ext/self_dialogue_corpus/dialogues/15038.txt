Whats your favorite Bill Murray movie?
Well can I include older, unheard of movies?
Yes, of course!
Have you heard of the movie The Man Who Knew Too Little?
No, I haven't. Is it good?
Yes! It is my favorite Bill Murray movie of all time.
What is it about then?
Its about a guy who thinks hes an actor as a hitman, but it ends up being real.
Sounds like a thriller more than anything.
Yeah, but with Bill Murray it ends up being hilarious.
