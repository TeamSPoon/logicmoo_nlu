Do you know where many Disney stories come from?
Which ones?
The famous ones -- Cinderella and Snow White.
No, where do they come from?
They originally appeared in the stories by the Brothers Grimm!
Wow, that's interesting. Did the Disney group have any other sources of inspiration?
Definitely! They also borrowed from an even earlier compiler of stories.
That's amazing! Who is even an older source than the Brothers Grim?
That gentleman's name is Charles Perrault.
Yes, I heard he is the original source of Little Red Riding Hood.
