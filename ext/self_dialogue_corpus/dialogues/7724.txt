Have you seen any of the Harry Potter movies?
I've seen them all.
What one was your favorite?
I really liked the first one.
They seemed to stick closer to the book with that one.
I've never read any of the books.
Why haven't you read the books?
I'm not much of a reader.
You can borrow it if you want?
Yeah, why not.
