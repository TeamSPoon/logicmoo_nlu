Are you a fan of Will Ferrell movies at all?
I absolutely loves his movies.
He's a fantastic comedy actor. All of his movies are wonderful.
Which is your favorite?
My favorite has to be "Anchorman."
Yes that one was the best!
My friends and I still to this day will quote certain lines from the movie.
Oh how hilarious.
That's one movie that I will watch again and again.
Oh me too. I loved it.
Didn't they come out with a sequel to that movie?
I think so but I never did see it.
You know which of his other movies that I love?
Which one is that?
"Elf". It is such a cute Christmas movie.
I love that! We watch it every December around Christmas.
I can't wait for Christmas season again.
Remember in the movie where he put candy on his spaghetti?
Yes it looked so gross!
I know I couldn't stop laughing.
