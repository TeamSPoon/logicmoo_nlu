I just love movie musicals.
Oh, me too! Which ones do you like?
Hairspray, Chicago, Mamma Mia, Rent...
Phantom of the Opera, Les Mis, Beauty and the Beast...
Did you see La La Land?
Yeah, it was good, but that ending, though! I cried!
I can not see that ever again.
Yeah, a bit too sad.
Makes you wonder what's coming from Broadway next.
I kind of hope it's Wicked or something like that.
You know, that reminds me! I've not seen Into The Woods!
Me neither, want to watch it together?
Yeah, I'll bring the popcorn!
I'll bring the tissues and the drinks!
Should we invite our friends?
Nah, let's watch it just us. They're all busy these days, anyway.
Yeah, you're right. Jobs, babies, etc.
Your place or mine?
Um, we did mine last time, so how about yours?
Okay. Might have to clean up a bit, but it's a deal.
