What are you listening to?
Nineties music.
Is that the Backstreet Boys?
No I think it is In Sync.
I never could keep them straight.  My little sister loved them all.
Every era has its fair share of boy bands but they seemed to be really popular in the nineties.
Remember that one hit wonder group, Hanson?
Oh yeah, weren't they brothers or something?
Yes and they are still together and still making music.
Boys to Men is touring this summer.
No way!  That would be a fun concert to go too.  My acapello group in college used to cover them.
Really?  What songs did you guys sing from them?
End of the Road.  Poison.
Poison wasn't them.  It was BellBivDevoe.
Oh that's right but they were part of Boys to Men before they broke up.
No, they were from New Edition.
You seem to really know your Boy Bands.
Nah.  I just have a knack for remembering weird facts.
So what do you remember about Menudo?
Eighties group - they were from the eighties and I am too young to remember them.
