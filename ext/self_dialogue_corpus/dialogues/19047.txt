Do you like Fall Out Boy?
I did back when I was in middle school. Why?
They just came out with a new single and I was wondering if you'd heard it.
I didn't realize they were still putting out new music.
They just released a new song called Champion.
Do they have a new album coming out too?
Yeah they have a new album coming out in September.
What is the title of the album going to be?
The album is titled Mania.
How long has it been since they last put out a record?
Not that long. Their last album was called American Beauty/American Psycho and that was released in 2015.
That's so weird. I really had it in my head for some reason that they'd broken up.
Well, they did go on a hiatus for a few years.
Oh, that must be why. I'm excited I was wrong!
Yeah their newer music since starting back up again has been pretty good. Their sound is evolving I think.
That's cool. It's great watching bands grow creatively over time.
I agree. And Patrick Stump and Pete Wentz still make a pretty good songwriting team.
Have any of their new songs been as good as their original stuff, do you think?
There hasn't been anything quite as iconic as From Under the Cork Tree, but it's all pretty good.
Cool. I'm going to go listen to Champion.
