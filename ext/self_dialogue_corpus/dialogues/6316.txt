So what did you think of Frozen?
I thought it was all right.
Just all right? What didn't you like about it?
Well, it didn't make sense to me.
What didn't make sense?
Well, a few things actually.
Oh? Like what?
Well, for one, why would anyone try selling ice in a kingdom that's made of ice?!
Haha, you goof! Did you really enjoy the movie or not?
Oh, I enjoyed it well enough. Especially the singing.
