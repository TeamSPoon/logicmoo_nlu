Do you like taylor swift?
I do like taylor swift.
She seems really down to earth and like she would be easy to talk to.
I like how she writes her own songs.
Yes, you can tell that they stem from her life experiences.
It is sad that she was picked on in school.  Kids can be so mean.
Yes, but that gave her alot of momentum for her songs.
I really like her upbeat songs.
I know.  She had a really cool video done in the woods.
Yes.  I remember that song.
I think it was called into the woods.
She hasn't had much out lately.
No, I can't remember the last song she released.
I wonder if she is working on a new album.
Maybe.  It seems that she had alot of songs as once and then nothing.
They still play alot of her songs on the radio.
I usually listen to her on Pandora.
I have a station that is set to her music.
It makes me want to listen to her old songs.
I think I have her cd.
