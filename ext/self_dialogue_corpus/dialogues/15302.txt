Who is the best guitar player ever?
My vote goes to Keith Richards.
Is he from the Rolling Stones?
Yes! He is a phenomenal guitar player.
I don't think he is the best though.
Who do you think is the best guitar player ever?
I think Bob Dylan.
Really? No way!
Bob Dylan is one of the most talented musicians I have ever heard.
But I do not think he is the best guitar player ever.
What about John Mayer? Is he one of the best?
He is an incredible musician as well, but I do not think he is amongst the best guitar players.
Even though he filled in and played with the Grateful Dead?
Yes. I just do not think he is as talented as someone like Keith Richards.
I guess we will agree to disagree then.
We should read SPIN magazine or a periodical like that. I bet they will have a list of the best guitar players.
They might. But these lists are always so subjective.
At the end of the day, I suppose it doesn't matter.
Right! There are so many amazing guitar players. We are luck to have such great music.
Agreed! Let's go home and put on some albums!
