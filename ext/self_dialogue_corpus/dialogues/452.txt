Pick a dark horse NFL championship matchup.
Ooooh, fun. The crappy teams making it.
No, the better-than-expected teams that are going to come through out of nowhere.
You mean only making it because of Tom Brady or Aaron Rodgers getting injured?
Sure.
Hmm...
And don't say the Browns to be a troll.
Dang! How'd you know?
You're predictable. Go ahead.
I choose the Bills and Bengals.
Try again?
Excuse me?
They're in the same conference, so they wouldn't be in the championship.
You said championship, not Super Bowl. I'm assuming the AFC championship.
Fine, why those two?
Both have been somewhat solid teams the last few years but fell short.
They have such a bad history the last 25 years, though
Right? They're due. Bengals haven't won a playoff game since 91, I think, and the Bills haven't been to the title game since their 4-peat of being losers.
I'm going for the Colts and Eagles in the SUPER BOWL.
Eagles have no chance! They're irrelevant.
