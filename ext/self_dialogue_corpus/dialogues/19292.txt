Remember the good old days of college? Parties, less stress, and listening to Linkin Park?
Oh, I miss those days. Linkin Park was basically the anthem of my college days.
I remember the first time I heard Crawling. It was intense and really seemed to speak to me.
Crawling was a great song. Takes me back to memory lane.
What other Linkin Park songs bring back memories.
Definitely Numb.
That came out in 2003? Right?
Yes, I believe it was really popular some time around December of 2003.
That came out after, In the End, I believe.
By a couple of years. I remember specifically Numb was towards the end of 2003 because I had a major life changing event at the beginning of 2004, a positive one.
Oh, I know what you are talking about with regards to 2004.
Yes, that. And Numb really brings back memories of that time in my life and the positive things that happened.
You seem to really have some nostalgia with Linkin Park.
Yes, I definitely do. The music reminds me of happier times and my 20's.
I wish I could go back to my 20's as well.
Yes, sometimes music really tells a story and sometimes you associate music with those times. I associate Linkin Park with those times.
What other bands remind you of those times.
Bands like Sum 41, Foo Fighters, and Sevendust.
Oh, Sevendust. Been a while since I've heard something from them. Great band.
Yes, they were awesome. Their music was hard hitting.
