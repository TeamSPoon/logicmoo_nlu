Peter Pan is definitely one of the most well known Disney movies of all times.
I totally agree, I think everyone knows who Peter Pan is!
Yeah, and even more so Tinkerbell and Captain Hook!
So true. Plus there were so many versions that came out.
Yeah, like Hook and the live verison of Peter Pan, not just the cartoon!
There was also that newer one, but I can't remember what it was called.
I think it was called Pan?
Yes! That's it! It was about the beginning of Hook and Peter Pan's relationship.
Yeah! It was so unexpected, I would never imagine they'd be helping each other.
Yeah, considering the whole animated movie is The Lost Boys at war with the Pirates!
