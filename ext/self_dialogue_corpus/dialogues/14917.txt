What do you think of Adam Sandler films?
I like the ones with Drew Barrymore in them.
Me to. They're great together.
As for Adam the worst movie he ever did is 'The Water Boy.'
I agree. That character is annoying.
Yeah, even the voice is. I don't like that stupid voice he does.
What about the one in Little Nicky?
Also annoying. He's better without voices.
I kind of agree. He overdoes it.
Not as much as some actors but he does at times.
