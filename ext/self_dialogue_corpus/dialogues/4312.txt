Have you watched Take Shelter? It's a psychological thriller.
Is that the one with Michael Shannon and Jessica Chastain?
Yeah that's the movie. It was really good. Michael Shannon plays a borderline bi polar husband and father who thinks the apocalypse is coming so the takes action to build a bomb shelter while trying to warn his small town of the impending doom.
I haven't seen it yet but I remember people were chatting about how the ending to that movie was such a mind bender.
Yeah the movie is really good. It has you guessing just if he's truly going crazy of it this doom is real. Jessica does a great job playing his caring and nurturing wife.
Michael Shannon and Jessica Chastain are both such great actors. I watched Michael in this other small movie recently called Frank and Lola and he was terrific in that as the possessive boyfriend and star chef.
I know. I totally agree with you. I watched Jessica Chastain in Miss Sloane just a short while ago and she played such a strong role as the political lobbyist in that political thriller.
I need to see Miss Sloane, I heard it was really good. What was your final verdict for Take Shelter?
I really enjoyed Take Shelter. It had me in suspense the whole time. It set a really unsettling and uncomfortable feeling throughout and by the end I was in awe at what was revealed.
Okay, no spoilers please. I think I'll have to see if it's available to watch!
