They need to change the three point line.
Why?
It disincentivizes fun play.
What kind of play?
It ruins fast play.
It means players have to be less aggressive?
Kind of.
I could see that.
I think the movement is fine.
Really?
Like, the actual movement.
I don't think the movement is fine at all.
It's just that they need to encourage cleverer play.
Not really.
Like, more loops and careful movement.
Well. I guess?
They can move as slow as they want.
Well, I suppose.
As long as it encourages decent movement and complexity, like? It's fine.
I suppose.
