Who is the best Manning?
Eli
I think it is Peyton
No way. Eli beat Tom Brady twice
So what?
That means something. Peyton won because of his defense.
That's not true
yes it is
Peyton had better career numbers
But, Eli was more clutch
That is a good point
Remember the Patriots game?
The Super Bowl?
Yes, and they were undefeated
True
Eli beat an undefeated team, in the Super Bowl
Good point
So are you on my side now?
Yes I am
Alright. Eli all the way.
