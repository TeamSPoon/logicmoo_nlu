Who does Manning guy play for?
You mean Eli Manning? He plays for the Giants.
No, the other one. His brother?
Payton Manning? He retired and does insurance commercial on TV.
Oh, well I guess that's how much I paid attention.
Speaking of commercial, have you seen one with Greenbay Packers players?
That one with the guys with long hair?
Yeah, Clay Matthews. He's funny.
Not a bad player either. He is a defensive player, right?
Yeah, kinda mean player. Effective though.
Not a big fan of the team though, me being Minnesota native.
That's understandable. I don't care for them myself too much. Fans are too crazy!
Not as obnoxious as Pittsburgh fans though.
Or the Raiders' fans...
Nooo! the Cowboys fans!!
Oh, yeah!! Cowboys fans are the worst!!!
They actually won some games last season, didn't they?
They did...drove me crazy!
Well, let's hope the vikings play good this season.
I have a good feeling about them this year!
