Hey B! What are you listening to?
Just some funk music, old school tunes mostly.
What do you mean by funk music?
You know, old school Parliament Funkadelic, Red Hot Chili Peppers...
I've heard of both of them!
You like p-Funk or RHCP?
I like the new Chili Peppers album, the one that came out a couple years ago.
Ah yeah, I gave that a listen. They've kind of strayed from the funk.
I think that is why I like them now, they are more pop rock which is cool.
That works, but I'd recommend checking out their earlier albums.
Which one's do you like in particular?
Mother's Milk, By The Way, all really emotional albums.
Those have weird titles, I might give them a listen.
Awesome, tell me if you like them! And don't forget Californication!
I think I've heard that song before!
It's arguably their best track, and in my opinion for sure their best album.
What is your favorite Chili Pepper's song?
Ahh that is a tough one. I'd have to say Parallel Universe.
That is a great track title!
They are great period!
