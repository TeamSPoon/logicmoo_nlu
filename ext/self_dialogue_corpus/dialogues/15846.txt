What's the best album of the 2000s?
Tough question. If you asked me a few years ago I would say Funeral by The Arcade Fire.
That one was one of my tops for the period from 2000-2010, but I don't know if it has aged as well as I thought it would.
Yeah, I mean, I still love it, but it hasn't aged great for me.
So what's your favorite album of the 2000s so far?
I think it's To Pimp a Butterfly by Kendrick Lamar.
Crazy album! I think it'll go down as being his magnum opus.
It's just so well done. It's black music, there's jazz, there's soul, there's r&b, there's that Compton sound, but there's also stories and poetry.
Yeah, I had this feeling that he sounds like a beat poet at times. I'm thinking of Fo Free specifically.
Great song. The album has such great emotional depth too.
Yes, U is one of the most depressing but revealing songs I've ever heard by any artist.
Yeah, it's not simply I like this girl and she doesn't like me back.
I know, it's about serious self-doubt and criticism and depression.
He's completely inverting the stereotype of the rapper as needing to be confident at all times.
Which is a very healthy thing. There's more to life than being able to boast.
That's for sure. I think that To Pimp A Butterfly is the best, what's yours?
Call me out of touch, but my pick is from 2001.
Amnesiac by Radiohead?
Nope, it's Yankee Hotel Foxtrot by Wilco. That album does it for me, it's noisy and experimental, but has real depth to it.
I spent a lot of time with that record in college. Nice pick!
