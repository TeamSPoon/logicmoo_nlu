Did you like the 40 year old virgin?
Yes Steve carell is a riot.
My favorite is Evan almighty,  he's funny in that.
Yeah but I liked Bruce almighty better.
True,  the butt monkey scene was a classic.
I liked Jim Carrey better then,  than when he did ace ventura.
Hmm, I never saw those.
Don't waste your time,  they aren't great.
Good to know,  thanks.  What other Jim Carrey movies are funny?
Liar liar is pretty good. I'd check that out next.
