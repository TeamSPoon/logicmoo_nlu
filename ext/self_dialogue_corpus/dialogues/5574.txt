Did you like the Tarzan cartoon?
The one by Disney?
Yeah, that one.
It was okay.  I just didn't think that it was one of their best.
Really?  I loved it.
Well, it came out just a couple years after Hercules.  Hercules was much better.
Yeah, I liked Hercules a lot better.
I mean, the popularity from Hercules still wasn't up when they released Tarzan.
Still, Tarzan was a totally different story.
Yeah, you're right.  It was much more heartwarming.
