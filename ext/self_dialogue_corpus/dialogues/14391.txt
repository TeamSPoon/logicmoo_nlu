How about those Celtics?
What about them?
Well, they have a nice core.
Eh, the Cavs are no competition for them.
Yea, but the Cavs aren't picking first in the draft.
So who are your saying is their savior?
Markelle Fultz
Where is he gonna play?
Right alongside Isaiah Thomas?
You're gonna put Fultz at the shooting guard position?
Yes, I think so.
Where would Avery Bradley go?
Look to trade him.
Trade your defense stopper?
You gotta do something to get Fultz into the lineup.
But that for a rookie?
Yea, hes got immense talent.
We'll see, but I dont know about the Celtics.
Just watch out next year.
We will see.
