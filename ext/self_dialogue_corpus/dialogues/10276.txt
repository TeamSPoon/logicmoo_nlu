Die Hard is one of my all time favorite movies.
It was Bruce Willis' best role.
I just think the scenes with the buildings blowing up were great.
Had awesome acting in it for sure.
That too, and the plot twists.
I dont think there were that many of them.
Enough to make you hooked, I dont know why they did sequels though.
Sometimes you want to capture lightning in a bottle.
At the expense of the viewer?
Hardcore fans go to any action movie regardless of a thinning plot line.
