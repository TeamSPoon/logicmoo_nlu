I just spent all morning trying to win Tom Petty Tickets.
Where is he playing?
At the Wells Fargo Center in  Philly.
Why don't you just buy them.
Sold out!
That sucks, so did you win?
Nope. I tried and tried but no luck.
I would love to see him play in concert.
Me too, my son has seen him about 30 times.
Really.
Yes and one he paid 2500 for a ticket to be on the side stage at the Firefly Music Festival.
Holy Cow! He must love Tom Petty.
He does. It is his favorite singer.
I love all of his songs
Listen to her Heart is one of my favorites0
That one is good and so is Free Fallin'.
Yes, I know they are going to give away more tickets so I am going home to try again.
Good luck!
Thanks if I win I will take you.
That would be awesome!
