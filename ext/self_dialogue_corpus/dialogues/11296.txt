I was just reading this interesting article about underrated drummers in rock music.
Did it mention Ringo Starr?
It did! I have always thought he was a great drummer.
He definitely was, though I think a lot of people forget that.
Did you know that sometimes, he had to play in small cramped studios with very limited drum kits?
I did not know that! That makes his playing all the more impressive to me.
He was a good vocalist, too.
Really? I'm not sure I know any songs that he sings.
Well, he provided contributed to group vocals on several of the songs. He was the main vocalist on "A Little Help from my Friends".
Oh, that's right! I love that song.
