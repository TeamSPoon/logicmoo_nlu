Do you listen to a lot of rock music?
I'll listen to older, classic rock.
Who do you like?
I like stuff like the Eagles and Kansas.
Oh, that's cool.
Yeah, I like the lighter stuff, nothing heavy.
The Eagles were awesome.
What was your favorite song by them?
It'd probably be Hotel California.
Yeah, that was one of their biggest hits.
