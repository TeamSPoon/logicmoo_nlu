What is your least favorite kind of music?
I do not like classical.
Me either, I can't stand it.
I do like new age music though.
Me too, I find it very relaxing, it helps me get to sleep sometimes.
My favorite kind of music is the kind that makes you want to get up and dance.
Yeah me too, I like techno a lot, especially for working out.
I usually listen to pop music the most though.
Yeah, I like that too, It is the most available kind of music when you turn on the radio.
Who is your favorite artist?
I like Rhianna alot.
Yeah I like her stuff too. My favorite is Nickelback.
I would love to see Nickelback in concert.
I have actually gone to see them a few times, they are great in person unlike some bands.
Yes I know what you mean, some people don't sound very good in person.
It would be so exciting to be a musician and sing in front of a live audience.
I don't think I could handle it. I would get stage fright .
I wonder if concerts are as popular as they used to be. It is easy to just stay home and watch music videos on youtube.
Yes, but I don't think the experience is anything close to going to see a live show.
Yeah you are right.
