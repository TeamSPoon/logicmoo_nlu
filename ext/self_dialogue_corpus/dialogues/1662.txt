Are you excited about the upcoming NFL season?
I am and hope there is less drama and more football this year.
You must be reffering to the 49ers?
Yes and primarily their quarterback Colin.
What was all the drama about anyway.
Honnestly, I am not sure.  All I can say is Colin destracted from the game and made me not want to watch it.
Was Colin any good at playing.
Colin was not good at all!  The 49ers won only 1 out of 11 games with Colin as quarterback!
WOW, the drama must have been to get attention away from how bad the 49ers were!
That is what I was thinking!  He was going to get cut and then created a bunch of drama to put the spotlight on himself.
Is he playing this year for the Niners?
No, Colin got cut from the 49ers shortly after the season ended!
That is funny, I guess the 49ers didn't want any more Colin drama!
I don't think so and I am glad to get rid of the drama and watch some pigskin get tossed around.
Has Colin been picked up by any other teams?
No, as of now Colin has been shunned by all other teams.
I guess nobody wants the Colin drama on their team!
Yeah, his drama did nothing but ruin the team.
Your right! the Niners had a horrible season last year.
I hope this NFL season is drama free and back to football.
