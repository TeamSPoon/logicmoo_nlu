Was Role Models Paul Rudd's finest work?
It was one of the funniest films he was in.
I thought so too, but Wanderlust was also funny.
That movie was too romantic to be an all out funny film.
Yeah Jennifer Aniston was good in that one as well.
She played a good job.
But back to Role Models, Sean William Scott was a good actor as well.
The movie was Rudd's finest but it wasnt the funniest that came out at that time.
Do you think it was funnier than StepBrothers?
No I think that takes the cake as the funniest
John C Reilly was so great in that film
I loved the Catalina Wine Mixer part.
When they performed as the duo?
Yes the way they sung was hilarious
I loved the opera genre Ferrell sang in
Yes it was so good
That movie had so many actors in it
It worked real well with them thats for sure
Yeah I loved the movie and still watch it
I dont like when its not on a premium channel thouhg
