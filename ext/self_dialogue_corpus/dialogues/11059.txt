It's playoff season in hockey town right now, who are you rooting for?
The Anaheim Ducks, I think they have a shot at the cup this year.
Dude they just beat the Predators tonight
What was the score?
Ducks 5 Predators 3 I don't think the Predators expected that score.
Especially this season a lot of games went into shoot out so I agree the score could have been closer.
They may come back and win on Tuesday.
What time is that game I want to watch it.
5 pm the predators are the home team.
What game are they in and who leads the series.
Game 3 is on Tuesday and the series is tied 1-1.
So Tuesday night is defiantly going to be exciting.
Yeah it better be we are in the semi finals right now.
.Who are the other two teams playing right now.
Ottawa and Pittsburg, Ottawa leads that series1-0.
Really the penguins are down on the series?
Yeah I am surprised too but thats why i think the ducks can win the cup this year.
Well we have seen the western league become a hockey force in recent years.
Its totally the weather in California.
I agree come to my place to watch the game Tuesday.
