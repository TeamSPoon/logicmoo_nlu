I dont know if there are any blockbuster films coming out this summer.
You might be right.
Usually we see about 2 or 3 of them that get released in July.
Seems like its a down year for films.
Thats what we say but the Academy thinks otherwise.
Blockbusters released in the summer are rarely recognized.
I know they are usually visually pleasing films.
Like an Independence Day?
Yes but I dont want to see a Will Smith film
He made quite a few of those kinds over his career.
I know and thats why I am through with them.
Maybe Spiderman could be considered that movie
I dont think its a blockbuster though.
What about Guardians of the Galaxy?
That was released too early though.
Yeah I cant think of one movie coming out then.
I remember when every year there was at least one lined up
I dont think it matters then.
No it doesnt but people still look forward to it
They will watch whenever not when the seasons dictate
