Did you ever see the new Ghostbusters movie?
No, I didn't.
Why not?
I really don't like all those remakes.
Oh, well it wasn't really a remake.
What do you mean?
I mean, it's not like it used the same characters.
No, but it followed the same story line.
Well, it was a totally different idea.
How do you figure?
Well, the ghostbusters were girls.
It's still pretty much a remake.
Well, why did you like the original so much.
Because it was original.
Every idea borrows from something else.
What do you mean?
There's really no original idea with movies.
Ghostbusters was original!
Do you think that was the first movie with people trying to catch ghosts?
That's the first I had heard of.
