Hey, have you ever seen the original version of The Exorcist?
The one with Linda Blair?  I saw it some time ago.
I think it's one of the scariest movies ever made.
It really frightened me when I saw it.  It stays with you.
Yes, I didn't want to turn the lights out when I went to bed after watching it.
That scene where Linda Blair's character vomits is so gross!
I have laughed at that part when I've been in the right mood.
I think it's so eerie when she talks in that possessed voice.
Oh, that's one of the more disturbing parts.
I used to do an impression of her voice when I was in college.  People would laugh.
