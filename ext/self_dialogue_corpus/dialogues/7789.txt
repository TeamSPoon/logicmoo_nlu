Every single time I see the Harry Potter movies, I find something new in them.
I do too, decades in to watching them.
The whole of them are just so full.
I think one of my favorite scenes from the movies is the one where Harry, Ron, Neville and a couple other Gryffindors are sitting in the bunk room eating the different magical sweets
While so much is wrong in their world, they are just being kids.
My favorite thing about Harry Potter in general is just when they're in school and nothing is going wrong. Just magical kids being magical kids.
I love the classes and Quidditch, and all the little magical details of Hogwarts.
The moving staircases. The magical pictures.
The little details that make the place something magical, make me want to go there.
Of course, then there is the troll in the dungeon, makes me rethink wanting to go.
