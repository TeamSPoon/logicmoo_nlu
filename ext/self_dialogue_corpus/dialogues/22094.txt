Hey, have you seen any good movies lately?
Not really. The last one I saw in theaters was "Get Out."
Oh yeah? How was it?
Overall it was pretty good, but the ending sucks.
Really. Would you recommend it?
Sure, if there's nothing better playing. Is it still out?
I'm not sure, I'm sure it's playing somewhere.
Probably. What else is out?
The new Pirates of the Carribean movie seems good.
I think they're getting a little over done.
Yeah, they've definitely made a lot but people seem to like them.
I never cared for them much, I do like Johnny Depp though.
He's a great actor. Any movies out you care to see?
I was thinking about the new Guardians of the Galaxy movie.
Oh, I heard that was good!
I liked the first one. Honestly, I'm more excited to see the soundtrack.
The soundtrack? Really?
Yeah, have you heard the soundtrack from the first movie?
No, I haven't.
It's one of the best I can think of off the top of my head. You should check it out!
