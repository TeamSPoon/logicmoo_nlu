I was on the bus early and the guy next to me was singing "Deception, Disgrace" from Lion King 2.
The one about Scar's son? What was he called again?
Kovu, I think.
Yeah that's the one. Such a good tune.
Indeed. It's one of the few sequels to be as good as the original.
I think it's actually better.
For real.
Yeah for a start there's no Timon and Pumba.
What? They're such key parts of the film. Without them there'd be no Hakuna Matata.
What does "Hakuna Matata" even me?
