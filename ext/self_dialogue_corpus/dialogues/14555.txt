So what do you think is the most ridiculous shot made that didn't count?
Um... I don't know, There are a few.
What's your favorite? C'mon we all have it.
Ok,. Alright. there was this one, this dude throws it off his 3 point line clear across the court. and it makes it in.
Curry.
Yeah, yeah, Curry.
That didn't count and should've.
That was a ridiculous shot though.
What's another one?
Um, The one where Curry felt down on the ground and toss the ball up and it still went in.
Oh yeah. that was in the game against Houston. That was funny.
Yep. Total luck though.
Remember Belinelli's shot?
The one where he bounces it off backside of Morris.
Yeah.
That was sneaky. That shouldn't have counted.
Isaiah Thomas' hook shot from outside the court behind the backboard.
HAHA. that was messed up.
There was this one where this guy throws it too high and it bounces off the goal support bar on top but it still goes in.
i haven't seen that.
