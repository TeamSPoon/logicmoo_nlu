What did you think of the last Super Bowl?
I thought it was great.  Very entertaining.
Yes,  I like the Super Bowls if they are competitive.
Me too.  Unless my team is in it of course then I don't care if it is lopsided in favor of my team.
That's with all the games I watch if I don't care who wins either way.
New England being in so many Super Bowls drives me nuts though.
I like to see different teams in.
I was kind of pulling for Brady in this Super Bowl though.
Why is that?
I just like the comeback and the underdog coming back.
It makes the game much more heroic that way.
I thought Atlanta had this Super Bowl locked up.
Me too I was surprised Brady was able to bring his team back.
It is what he's done for years.
They are never out of it with him back there.
His passing has been incredible.
The accuracy is amazing.
The other team hardly has a chance the ball comes out do fast and accurate.
New England was lucky to draft such a player.
They've been a dynasty for years as a result.  But he doesn't have many years left.
