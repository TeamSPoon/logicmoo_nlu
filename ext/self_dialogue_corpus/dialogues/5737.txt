I really love the classic Disney movies.
Me too!  The newer ones just aren't as good as the classics.  Which one is your favorite?
I love Cinderella.  Such a great story line!
I love the princess movies.  I think Snow White is my favorite.
I like the older ones because they were based on so many classic fairy tales.
The new ones just don't compare.
No they don't! I do like a few of the newer ones though.
Me too.  I thought Frozen was pretty good.
I agree.  I like a lot of the Disney-Pixar movies like Toy Story.
I like that one too....and the Monsters Inc movies.
