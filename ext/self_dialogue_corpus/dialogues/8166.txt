So what's up with Miley Cyrus?
oh I'm not really sure what she's up to, she's crazy
haha, indeed. I heard she had random sex with her fans one time?
yea, I'm wondering if she's always high. But nonetheless, she's a good singer
what song do you listen to then?
I listen to her songs a lot when at parties, girls loved it, like Party in the U.S.A
that song! I still remember people singinig along with it last time at the college bar
for sure, her song is even more popular in college town and fraternity clubs
what song do you recommend the most from her?
I think wrecking ball is cool
