Hi.
Hi.
Do you like the NFL?
Yeah I love it.
Cool me too.
Who is your team?
I like the Panthers.  You?
I'm a 49ers fan.
Oh okay cool.
Yep.
Do you play fantasy football?
Yeah my buddies and I have a league.  You play?
Yeah I love it.
What do you like most about it?
I guess that I can play with friends and that it's competitive.  What about you?
I like that it keeps me interested in all the games, not just one or two big ones.
Yeah I know what you mean.
When you're kicker needs a few points you will watch the most boring game just to see it.
Yep that is right, I feel the same way.
Good talking to you.
