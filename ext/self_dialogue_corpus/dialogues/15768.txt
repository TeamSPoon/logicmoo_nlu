What's your favorite type of music?
I'm really into hip-hop. I also like metal and rock music.
Did you ever listen to Soundgarden?
I absolutely love Soundgarden.
I remember seeing the video for "Black Hole Sun" when I was a kid. It scared me.
That video is iconic and so is the song. Everyone knows that song.
Their vocalist actually had a four octave range.
Really? That's crazy.
Yeah, that's the same range as Christina Aguilera.
Wow. I would never have imagined that to be true.
Yeah, he was also in another band called Audioslave.
I remember hearing a couple of their songs.
They did have some commercial success. I think their self titled was a masterpiece.
What was your favorite song off of it?
I would have to say "Cochise".
I actually have heard that song. It's really good.
The guitar part in that song is instantly catchy.
It's has a classic rock feel to it.
I feel like that album sets the bar for new-age rock music.
I'm going to have to go back and listen to it.
