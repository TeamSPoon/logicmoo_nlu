You want to watch a movie?
I do, but I'm depressed and I can't make a choice.
Well, do you feel like something you've seen before or something new.
I don't know.
What about Oliver Stone?
Current Oliver Stone, or Oscar winner Oliver Stone?
Oscar Winner, I guess.
Okay, but not Natural Born Killers.
Agreed. But you can't deny, Sizemore was the bomb in that.
He's the best in everything he's in. Freakin' love Tom Sizemore.
What about JFK.
I love it, but I saw it the other day. John Candy gives the preformence of a life time.
Yeah. It's so good, I'm willing to believe Kennedy was killed by helicopter salesmen.
Oh, yeah, that's the conclusion that Kevin Costner came to, isn't it?
Yeah. A compelling argument, nonetheless.
What else you got?
Born on the Fourth of July?
Yes! That's perfect.
Yeah, he really made some class movies back in the day.
Shame he's so terrible now.
