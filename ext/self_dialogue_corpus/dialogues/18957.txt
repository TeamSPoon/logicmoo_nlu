Man, my neighbors are playing such loud music all the time lately!
Oh no! Is it annoying?
It's not bad music or anything, but it's really difficult to concentrate.
What kind of music are they playing.
It's mostly stuff like The Lumineers and Alpha Rev.
I don't know Alpha Rev.
They're a kind of alt-rock band. They're not super loud or intrusive or anything.
Then what's the problem?
Sometimes it makes me feel like singing along!
Do you sing often?
All the time. Mostly in the shower.
What sort of music?
A lot of Beatles songs, but also anything I happen to hear throughout the day.
I didn't know this about you at all.
Sometimes music just gets stuck in my head. I can't help it!
I'm sorry. That sounds like a big problem.
It's not so bad. Do you like to sing at all.
Yeah, but only under the right conditions?
What are the right conditions?
Karaoke!
