What's your favorite genre of music?
I'm a big fan of hip hop.
Cool. Who's your favorite hip hop artist?
Currently, my favorite is probably Kendrick Lamar. But Tupac is my favorite rapper of all time.
I don't really listen to much rap, but I think those two are both really talented.
What type of music do you prefer?
I really like pop music.
Who are some of your favorite pop artists right now?
I really like Carly Rae Jepsen, Taylor Swift, Rihanna, Lorde, and Ariana Grande.
Oh I love Ariana Grande. She has an amazing voice.
I think so too. It's amazing such a big voice can come out of such a small person.
I used to really like Taylor Swift too but in my opinion her more recent albums haven't been as strong as her early ones.
I can see what you mean. Her sound has definitely changed a lot over time.
Yeah, I don't really enjoy most country music but I liked it when she had a country sound.
Yeah, I think she sounded a little bit more authentic back then.
For sure. You could definitely tell she was writing her own stuff.
Although, her songs now are pretty catchy too I have to say.
They're definitely catchy, but they always get stuck in my head!
Oh I know! I remember having Blank Space stuck in my head for days at a time after that came out.
Me too!
