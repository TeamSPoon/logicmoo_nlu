What ever happened to Rick Moranis?
I think he walked away to raise his family.
That's comendable.
The last thing I remeber him in is the "Honey I Shrunk the Kids" movies.
I loved those growing up.
Yeah, he was pretty funny.
I noticed he didn't do a cameo in Ghost Busters.
He was about the only one.
Ha! Not even Moranis could have saved that stinker!
All too true.
