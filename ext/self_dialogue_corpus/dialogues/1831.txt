The culture surround the NFL just keeps growing. It's got to be worth millions.
I know. Things used to be so simple, not there are tons of replays in high def!
Yeah, that's pretty cool.
Do you know how many teams there are these days?
I think there are 32 teams, with an average team value of $1 billion.
Holy cow! I didn't realize they were that valuable!
Well, if you think the average game attendance for an NFL game is 66,957 spectators...
After the tickets, add in the beer, food, and souvenirs. Yeah, I can see that.
Did you know there are nearly 3 million sports industry jobs in the U.S, that's approximately 1% of the population.
I never thought of it that way. Not to mention all the commerce that is indirectly related.
Yeah, According to the California Avocado Commission, 12 million pounds of avocados will be purchased in the week leading up to the Super Bowl.
Wow, that's a lot of guac! I love that stuff!
You and every other American on Super Bowl Sunday! That's like 8 million pounds of guacamole!
I love the food that is associated with football! All that yumminess that goes so well with beer!
Guess what the most popular foods are?
Pizza has to be in there!
Wings and pizza are the most popular Super Bowl snacks.
I get that and a few other goodies, then kick back and watch the big boys play!
Hey that's why it's football is the best sport around.
Yeah, just like “G” on the Green Bay Packers helmet doesn’t stand for Green Bay, but rather, it stands for “Greatness.”
