Did you see the game last night between the Cubs and the Yankees?
Yes I did! It was such a close game.
I can't believe it lasted 18 innings, what a game!
Severino brought his A game for sure.
I know! Crazy! He pitched a velocity of 100.2 MPH.
Alot of sliders and fastballs...insane!
What about the Mets though, did you hear what happened?
No I didn't! What's up?
They suspended Matt Harvey three days without pay for an undisclosed violation of team rules.
Whoa! For real?? What did he do?
Apparently he was suspended after not showing up to the ballpark Saturday.
Oh yea, that'll get you. I wouldn't have done that if I were him.
Yea...it really took a hit on the team.
Yea! They were crushed by the Marlins right?? 7-0.
Ouch...just hearing that hurts my ears.
What about the Reds vs. Giants game??
Oh man, that game was interesting! The Reds outscored the Giants big time 27-5 last Friday and Saturday combined.
Yea, I thought that the Giants had a more hopeful future.
I agree. They've had the worst season NHL 11-21.
Definitely don't see a celebration in the near future.
