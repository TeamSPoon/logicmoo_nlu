Did you ever see open water 2?
Is that the shark movie?
Yea the one where the friends go on a boat and end up trapped off of the boat. I don't think it's very shark heavy though.
Yea I think it's just more about being stuck int he water.
Yea, the friends start out pretty optimistic and then slowly start to turn on one another.
Yea, it was a good thriller even without the sharks.
I agree, I think in the end a couple survive.
Yea that part was stupid, after all those people died, for two people to live was dumb.
If it was me, I'd feel too guilty to go on after that.
Me too, I couldn't do it.
