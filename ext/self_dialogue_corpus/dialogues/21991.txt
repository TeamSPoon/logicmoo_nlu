So did you see the new mummy movie?
the one starring tom cruise?
yes, that one.
nope, I don't think it's a good movie.
Why do you think so?
I don't know. I mean I watched the trailer, and it does not look good.
Have you seen the original mummy movie?
yes I have, The first movie was so scary.
I totally agree. I was not able to sleep for 2 days.
Yes, There was this one scene in which I almost got heard attack.
Oh Yes! I remember that scene as well, The one in which the mummy suddenly appears.
Yes, that scene.
I remember, It was so scary that they were forced to make second part less scary.
Well, I don't see a point of making a horror movie that is not scary.
By the way this new mummy movie doesn't look scary at all.
Yes I totally agree. It looks more of an action movie than a horror movie.
Makes sense why they took tom cruise.
ha ha ha.. Are you suggesting that tom cruise is symbolic of action movies?
I think he pretty much is.
Yes, It is hard to ignore his mission impossible movie series.
