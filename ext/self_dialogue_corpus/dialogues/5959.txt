Did you catch Disney's Moana.
Yeah, so cute! I'm sure all the little girls loved it.
The Rock was awesome in it!
He had his humble demi-god character down perfectly.
There was a nice dynamic between him and Moana.
Yeah, precious.
Some of the graphics were gorgeous.  What was the thing with the chicken?
Beats me.  Those little coconut pirates were so cute.
Loved that part. And the grandma.
The green goddess was the best though.
