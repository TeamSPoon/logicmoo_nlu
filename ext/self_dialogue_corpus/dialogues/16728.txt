Have you ever listened to Arcade Fire?
No, I haven't. Are they any good?
I like them a lot, I just started listening to them.
Nice, what album would you recommend I check out first?
I really like their Funeral album
Cool, what is it like?
It's sort of like indie rock, but it's pretty heavy on electronic instruments.
Oh cool, I'm not big on electronic music but I'll check it out.
Their Neon Bible album is really good too, but it's a little out there.
I see, I might have to check that out.
Do you listen to Tame Impala at all?
I do, I really like them.
What album is your favorite?
I like Currents, it's a really good album to listen to all the way through.
I'll check that one out, I've been meaning to get into their music.
Yeah it's really cool, kind of weird though.
I'm always down for some weird music, I do enjoy Captain Beefheart from time to time.
Awesome, I've never been able to get into his music. It's feels like an acquired taste.
You should check out Safe As Milk, that's probably his most accessible album.
Oh I've never listened to that one, I'll give that a shot later.
