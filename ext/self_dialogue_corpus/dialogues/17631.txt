So what's your favorite kind of music?
Country!
You know, I'm a yankee who moved down south.  All my friends make fun of me but I have to admit it's grown on me.
Some of the best music out there is country.
I'm not a huge fan but there are some elements I really like...
Such as?
For one thing, the community is very inclusive.
They sure are!
For another thing, I like how they fuse the music with pop in such an appealing way.
Well, a lot of "old school" country fans hate that but I like it as well.
Some of the best songwriting is also happening in that genre.
Without a doubt!
The downside to that is that a lot of the artists don't write their own songs.
That's true but that happens in every genre now!
I'm not so sure it's as prevalent in other genres.
I'm not either but the bottom line that there are so many amazing songs!
Who are some of the best artists, in your opinion?
I love Montgomery Gentry and Brooks and Dunn.
I take it you like duos?
Yes, I love it when two voices come together!
