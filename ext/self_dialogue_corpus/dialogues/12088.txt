I just saw The Phantom Menace.
It wasn't the best, but not the worst.
I didn't like the kid  who played Anakin.
Why not?
He was a little too cute for me.
I see what you mean.  Who did you like?
Natalie Portman was super hot, even in makeup.
I agree with that.
The Sith guy was super cool, though.
I liked Liam Neeson as Obi-wan.
