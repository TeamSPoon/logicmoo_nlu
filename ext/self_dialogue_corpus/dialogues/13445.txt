Who is better, Leia or Rey?
Rey
Why do you think that?
She has more experience fighting and grew up on her own
I think Leia was better
Why?
She had more diplomatic experience, plus she was a fighter
Yeah, but Rey could pilot the Falcon
I thought that was a bit questionable
I thought it was really cool to watch her fly it
