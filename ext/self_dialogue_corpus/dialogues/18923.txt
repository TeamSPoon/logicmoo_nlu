When you write, what music do you like to listen to?
Well, it depends on what I'm writing.
What's the default?
The default is Vangelis. I like it because alot of it is soothing - it's good mind music.
That name sounds familiar - where do I know him from?
He composed the soundtracks for a number of classics. Probably the most famous is The Chariots of Fire.
I knew Vangelis sounded familiar!
He also did the sound track for Blade Runner and Antarctica, as well as for others.
So the kind of austure music help you clear your mind and be ready to write?
Yeah - it's definitely can be austure but it's also so full of emotion and passion sometimes.
Deep feelings?
Yes - loneliness, grief, sadness, heartache. But also there can be joy, triumph, and just wild enjoyment of life.
Wow, that sounds really cool. What song do you think I should start with?
That's a hard one! Rachel's Song, as well as One More Kiss Dear, are some that I love.
Which one are those from?
They're from Blade Runner.
Why do you like them?
Well, again, there's the passionate feelings.
Right. What others should I listen to?
Abraham's Theme and Eric's Theme from the Chariots of Fire.
