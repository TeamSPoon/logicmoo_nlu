do you know death grips
yeah, why?
i've been listening to them a lot
they are very messy
yeah but its good intense music
i'd rather listen to metal
what type of metal
like pantera or megadeth
i like pantera a lot
rip pantera
they saved metal during the 90s
in the 90s all the great metal bands had such poor albums
yeah, didnt metallica release load during those times
yeah, i think so
pantera cowboys from hell
that songs riff is so heavy
its one of my favorite riffs ever
it is one of mine too
oh and walk
that songs is good
