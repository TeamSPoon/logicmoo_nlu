I love watching hockey except for one team.
I bet I can guess which team.
Go ahead and guess.
I guess the San Jose Sharks.
No! Why would you guess the Sharks?
Because the Kings are your team!
No way.  I like the Sharks.
Okay, which team do you not like to see play?
The Pittsburgh Penguins.
Well, nobody like Pittsburgh.
They are such a dirty team.
I agree.  I would even say nothing good comes from there.
Nothing good comes from Pittsburgh?
It's just a joke.
Oh, not very funny.
But I do not like the Penguins either.
That's good enough.
I am surprised you like the Sharks.
I know you are. I have to root for California.
I just hate the Sharks.
