What football scandals do you remember?
Oh, there's been so many....
Aaron Hernandez being like, the top one.
Yeah, it's such a shame what happened to him.
I don't think we've ever seen anyone in the NFL get life and then kill themselves.
Nope, definetely a first.
Rest in peace to him, but overall.....he shouldn't have done what he did.
Agreed.
I think another crazy scandal was obviously the Deflate gate.
I don't recall that one, what was it again?
The Patriots were accused of deflating their balls a little to affect how they were thrown.
Oh thats horrible, did they do it for real?
Oh, definetely. I'm pretty sure they got suspended for a while.
Brady must have been pissed.
Yeah, but they all deserved it.
True, you would just have yourself to blame for that.
I'm sure they weren't the only team to ever do something like that though.
Sure, football has been around forever, honestly.
I just know that rulebreakers like that always get caught eventually.
Yep, can't hide from nothing.
