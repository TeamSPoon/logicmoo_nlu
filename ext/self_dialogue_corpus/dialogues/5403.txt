So, what's your favourite Disney movie then?
Mine would probably have to be Lilo and Stitch.
I like that one too! Why is it your favourite?
I really love aliens and Stitch is so cute! Which one is your favourite?
Gotta go for The Lion King.
A classic - do you just like the songs or does the story do something special for you?
A bit of both really - I mean, who doesn't like "Hakuna Matata"
So true. When Mufasa dies at the start, so sad.
Yeah, really heart-wrenching moment. Bring tears to my eyes everytime.
Same here.
