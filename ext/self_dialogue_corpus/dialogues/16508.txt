Have you ever listened to Nuno Bettencourt?
Sounds familiar, but I can't place the name.
He's an amazing guitarist, and songwriter too.
Oh wait, is that the guy from Extreme? Who plays More than Words?
Yes, but honestly he's so much more than that! His solo stuff is some of the best music I've ever heard.
He played with Rihanna too right?
Yep! He went on tour with her for some years to make her show more rock.
Yeah I like that guy. Didn't know he had a solo career too.
Yeah, it's a shame it didn't take off because he's so talented. I listen to his stuff every day.
It sucks how the best musicians don't always get proper crefit.
I agree, too much fake music being promoted.
What's some good stuff from Nuno? I'm always looking for new music.
Definitely listen to his solo album Schizophonic. He played every instrument, wrote, sang, and produced it.
Wow! Ok, anything else?
Yeah, check out his albums from his solo groups Mourning Widows, Population 1, and DramaGods.
Ok I will. I have a 10 hour drive tomorrow so this will help.
Good! There's something for everyone on his albums.
I like his guitar playing a lot.
Wait til you hear him sing and hear the lyrics he's written. He's so talented.
I'm looking forward to it.
