Are you a football fan?
Are you talking about NFL or soccer?
NFL not soccer.
Not really but I have watched a few Falcons games in my past.
The Falcons new schedule is out for 2017 and their first game is August 10 in Florida.
Is it on TV?
Yes they are all televised.
Do all NFL teams get all their games televised?
I don't think so.
Then how do they figure it out?
Well that first game I mentioned for the Falcons was one of 4 preseason games. They are all televised.
How many regular season games are there?
Their schedule says 12 games and 1 bye. All of them on are on TV.
I guess it depends on what their ranking is going into this season  to who gets  televised maybe?
No it usually  gets played on local networks but sometimes it depends on the large net work if they are going to play it.
Sounds too confusing to me.
Whatever is going to make the most amount of money for the large network is probably the way it works for the most part.
oh yes it's all about the money and not for the love of the game.
I am glad i am not a football fan because it always made me mad when a game wasn't televised.
I can see how that would be very annoying.
