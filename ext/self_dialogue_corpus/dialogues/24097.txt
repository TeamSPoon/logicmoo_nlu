I grew up watching Singing in the Rain.
I should re-watch that. It was really good.
I had a crush on Donald O'Connor.
Not Gene Kelly?
Nah, he didn't do it for me.
Huh. Y'know Debbie Reynolds was only like nineteen when she did it.
That's way too young.
It was way too young for Carrie Fisher and Star Wars too, though.
Hollywood is just messed up when it comes to kids.
Yep. Still, I think they both survived it. Before they died there was a documentary...
Oh yeah! I've been meaning to check that out.
Apparently they lived next to each other and bantered all the time.
It was insanely tragic they died so close together but...
Yeah no, I feel you. It was kinda poetic at the same time.
Mhm. I was still super surprised, though.
Me too. Carrie was rockin' it in the Star Wars movies.
They're doing pretty well!
Yeah! Have you seen Rogue One yet?
Not yet. I'm excited for it though. Everybody says they haven't had as much fun watching Star Wars since the '80s.
Hahaha. Also known as 'this is so much better than the prequels.' But yeah it was great.
