I really enjoy how Ron matures throughout the series
At first he tries a bogus spell on scabbers.
I like when he is late to  Transfiguration and sees Mcgonagall turn from a cat.
Yeah In the first movie him and Harry are pretty mean to Hermione
I like how when they save her from the troll he doesn't rat them out.
He then isn't afraid to help her look to find out who Nicholas Flamel is.
When they're caught in devil snare he reminds Hermione that they can use magic.
He realizes that they have to play chess in order to move on.
He knows that it's harry who has move on so he sacrifices himself
Yeah and he ends up playing one of the best games of wizard chess.
