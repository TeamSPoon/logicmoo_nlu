What ever happened to dubstep?
Dubstep's still alive my friend!
All I remember is that Skrillex guy back in 2009.
Skrillz! Good guy. You know much about him?
Not really.
Well he actually started as a beatboxer.
No kidding.
He beatboxed hard, and incorporated wubs and drops in his sessions.
That's pretty cool, so he made music with his mouth?
Yeah he had a microphone, and he would win beatbox competitions.
So how did he become famous?
I suppose he started synthesizing what was in his head and became a DJ.
Man that is such a different life. What's your favorite Skrillex song?
Kill everybody.
That sounds pretty morbid.
Trust me. It's catchier than you think.
Hey me and you should try to do a beatbox competition.
Oh please. I'm as good as skrillex.
WUB WUB DUB DUB.
Good try mate.
