Man tell me the loudest show you ever saw?
That would have to be Soundgarden
What venue? How long ago?
This was the Fox Theater, in Oakland CA, February 2012
Just how loud was it?
Man they played a bunch of hits and album cuts too. Mostly male audience but no drama in the crowd
What made this so loud?
I don't know but the final song was "Fourth of July" and it was so loud and heavy it shook my jawbones
Is that the concert shirt?
Yep: as the shirt says, it really was "Louder than F***"
