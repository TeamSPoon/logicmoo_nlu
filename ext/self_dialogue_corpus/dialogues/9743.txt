Hey man, I heard you like rap, do you listen to Eminem?
Hey, well of course I listen to him, The Eminem Show is one of my favorite albums.
Oh for sure, Hailey's Song is definitely one of my top favorite songs.
That's a good one, he actually sings in that one. But I also like to listen to Atmosphere, you heard of him?
Slug? Well duh, you're speaking my language brother. Yesterday really hits home for me, the twist at the end really blew me away the first time I heard it.
Oh ya, I heard about what happened about your dad, I'm sorry brother. Atmosphere really knows how to articulate life.
That is so true, Trying to Find a Balance used to be something I told myself all the time, that song really kept me stable, pun intended.
Yep, Slug has kept me from falling over myself, too. But you can't forget about Del the Funky Homosapien, he keeps you moving and grooving.
Oh Ya, Del! Isn't that Ice Cube's Cousin?
You are correct sir, I feel Del is less ganster rap, but I can respect what Ice Cube puts down.
