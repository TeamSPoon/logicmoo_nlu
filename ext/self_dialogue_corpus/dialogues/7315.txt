My daughters are always watching Zootopia. They really like it a lot.
Oh, yes, I have seen it. It is a really good movie.
My favorite actress is Ginnifer Goodwin. She plays Judy.
She did do a good job, but my favorite actor is Jason Bateman. Not in the beginning, but at the end of the story.
Yes, he did a good job in the movie too.
What is your favorite part of the movie?
I enjoyed the part where Judy and Nick become friends and decide to work together. And you?
My favorite part is when the bad guys are caught. Boy, what a surprise to see it was the mayor!
I know, right. It was a twist to the movie.
I give the movie 5 stars.
