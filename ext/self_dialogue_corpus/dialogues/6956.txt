Did you watch Frozen
Yes
Did you like it?
I thought it was sad, but the castle seemed nice
It was better when it was unfrozen
I wonder what it would be like to have the frozen gift
It would be cool to take that ability down to the tropics
Yeah, you could show it to people who have never seen snow and watch their reaction
Did you like Olaf
Yeah, he was silly
