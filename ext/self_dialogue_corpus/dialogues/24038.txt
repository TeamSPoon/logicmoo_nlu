Samuel Jackson, and John Goodman.

Yeah! Tom hiddleston is a super cool ex- CIA guy.

yeah it's weird, but he plays a pretty cool role
So how was the movie?
It was awesome. I love watching movies with huge things fighting each other.
Who was Kong fighting?
Big lizards. I don't wanna say to much though. Don't want to ruin it.
Yeah. I definitely want to watch it. You should check out pacific rim or Godzilla.
Why those two in particular?
Big things fighting each other.
Haha! I see that now. I've seen godzilla, what's pacific rim?
Big robots.
