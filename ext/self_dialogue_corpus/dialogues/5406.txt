Do you think there will ever be a Toy Story 4?
I haven't heard of that, but it might be a good idea.
The Disney Toy Story movies are my favorite.
I think Toy Story 3 was better than the first 2.
I agree, each Toy Story movie seems to be better than the last.  That doesn't happen often with sequels.
My favorite part of of the movie was the Barbie & Ken characters.
I know, that was hilarious!  I had that same barbie doll as a child.
Yes, the barbie wearing the blue workout clothes & leg warmers!  That was so 1980's!
That movie definitely brought back memories!  I recognized a lot of the toys.
Yes it was a cute movie, and I'm glad it had a happy ending.
