Whats your favorite Disney movie of all time?
Aladdin, you?
Mine too! What was your favorite part?
When they take the magic carpet ride.
yea that was awesome, it had some great voice actors too.
It sure did, Robin Williams was my favorite.
I agree, but it Gilber Godfrey as Iago comes as a close second.
What an annoying voice, he was perfect for that role.
Yea, and so was Robin Williams as the genie.
He really sold that role.
