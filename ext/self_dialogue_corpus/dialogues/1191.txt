When do you think the NFL allows legal gambling?
Is it really up to them?
Yeah I think so, they have a team moving to Vegas.
Yeah it will get dicey there so maybe in the next 2 years.
I mean more than one city needs to allow it.
Well its more of a state thing then the NFL allowing it.
But the NFL could form a partnership with one of the daily fantasy companies
Thats not a market they want to go in
They have to think of new ways to make the game interesting
Well that doesnt really affect the game all that much
Yeah but it invites fans into watching the games
They get the stuff they need on their cell phones
They need to concentrate on Social media more.
Yeah banning teams from posting videos is dumb
Thats where they ruin the game for people
They are bringing back celebrations in a way
They need to sort of organically create personality
I agree with you on that point
Though I do not know that the game will ever really suffer
You never know they could get to NHL depths
