I hate pop music. Its thin, it's simple, it's flavorless.
It's supposed to be like that. The Beatles started out making pop. So did Madonna.
Yeah, they made it to be accessible. So nobody would be offended, and usually everybody would dance.
Or sing along, in their car, in the shower, wherever. What's wrong with that?
It's built out of lightweight ideas that anyone can grasp, that are not specific to anyone's life or ideas. It's generic.
It's not generic, it's universal. It brings people together, the way songs of praise do in a house of worship.
And it's made to be shocking, in a manipulative way, with sex or swearing or violence. Without provoking real thought or feeling.
I disagree. Love songs hit us where we live, and so many pop tunes deal with breaking away, becoming ourselves.
Becoming ourselves crowded in one of those giant stadiums, where the spectacle dazzles us, but nothing really happens.
A lot happens to me, I'll tell you. I love pop.
