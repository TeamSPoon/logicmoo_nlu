What would you do to improve the NFL?
I think the biggest thing that needs to be fixed is the overtime rule.
Yeah it could use a little work.
The biggest problem I have is that a touchdown wins but not a field goal. Why not have the other team get the ball after a touchdown as well.
The games would probably last to long then.
Maybe they would but a great game can be ended with a kickoff return for a touchdown and it's not fair to the team who lost in that case.
If you can't cover a kick you don't deserve to win.
Yeah but if it's a really good defense against a really good offense they should take the field at least once.
Well what would you do?
I like the college overtime system where each team gets the ball.
They would need to move it back because NFL kickers are a lot better.
Then start it at the 50 yard line each time.
It would never end on a tie then.
That would be the best part, who wants to watch a game that ends in a tie?
Remember when Donovan McNabb didn't even know the rules about ending on a tie?
Yeah he should have known better.
He is paid to play the game he should know the rules.
I think the college rules would make it even more exciting.
Some QBs would really up their stats too. Teams could score 14 points or more in overtime.
It would be ok the stats changed when they changed the games from 14 to 16.
