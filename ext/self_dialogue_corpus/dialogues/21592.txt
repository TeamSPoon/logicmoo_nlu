Did you know that Lin Manuel Miranda wrote a lot of the music for Moana?
Of Hamilton fame? No way!
Isn't that cool? He collaborated with Polynesian musicians to bring the music to life.
Is the music all in English? Or in Polynesian languages too?
They actually included Samoan, Tokelauan, and Tuvalu. With traditional instruments, too!
Wow! They've come a long way since Pocahontas. Actually consulting with native peoples?
I know! I've heard a lot of Polynesian people are very proud of how the movie turned out.
Did they use Polynesian actors too?
For the most part, they did! Did you know The Rock actually is of Maori descent?
Really? I had no idea! So he's in it too?
He is! And the actress that voices the main character, Moana, is Hawaiian.
How did they do with capturing the visuals of the scenery?
Oh my goodness, it's beautiful! The way they portray the water is magnificent.
Is it too late to see it on the big screen?
Unfortunately, yes. But maybe you could wait for a reshowing!
I want to see the whole world of the film! No iPhone screen for me.
That's the way to go. You'll want to see the detail on every mountain and wave.
So is it your new favorite Disney movie?
Totally! The music is just so good. And the story development!
You no longer need a prince to be a Disney princess!
