How did techno music come to be created?
That's an interesting story!
Please tell it to me.
Techno is important because it represents the beginning of the electronic dance music, EDM, phenomena popular today.
You mean artists like Paul Oakenfold and Tiesto?
Yes, they owe a huge debt to three kids who went to highschool together.
The Belleville Three?
Yes, Kevin Saunderson, Derrick May, and Juan Atkins.
But, don't they themeselves owe a huge debt to Kraftwerk?
They do. And, they have also acknowledged the influence of Giorgio Moroder on their music.
Yes, I Feel Love by Donna Summer and Giorgio Moroder represents a change in disco music.
That's correct. It's one of the first tracks with a progressive bass line and hard kick drum.
Those elements form the essence of techno music?
They do. Yet, the key was the "do it yourself" attitude of the three pioneers.
What do you mean?
In the early 1980s, Casio started releasing cheap synthesizers which were easy to obtain.
Why does that matter?
Easy access to these machines allowed the pioneers to spend endless hours playing around with musical possibilities.
And, that led to techno music?
Yes, but it is also critical that they were doing so in Detroit. That city has an important history of music which influenced the pioneers.
