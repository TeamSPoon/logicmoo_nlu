Did you watch the Superbowl last year?
Yes, I watch it almost every year.
I thought it was great. Lady Gaga had such an amazing performance.
Why are you telling me about the artists instead of the game itself?
The hafltime show is always the highlight, at least for me.
The halftime show is great, but it shouldn't be your highlight.
What was your highlight of last year's Superbowl then?
Well I'm originally from Atlanta, so it was exciting to see my hometown team Falcons be in the finals.
Didn't they lose?
Yes, ultimately they lost. But we were ahead for a lot of the game.
Who cares? You lost!
I care! We lost this year, but hopefully we'll keep up the momentum and do better next season.
Well you really could only go up from here...
Very funny.
Oh, I've just remembered another highlight from the game?
Please tell me it's actually related to the actual game or a player this time
It is. Tom Brady was my highlight - he's hot!
Remind me never to invite you over to my house to watch the Superbowl.
Why not??
I like to be surrounded by only true fans of the sport.
