What do you think of Lady Gaga's new music?
It's good but it's nothing like her old stuff. I really liked her older songs better.
She is such an incredible singer. What's your favorite music video?
I love the music video with Beyonce of course!
That one was good, but my favorite was Bad Romance.
What did you think about her playing a guy in the You and I music video?
It was so awesome!
And she dressed in drag in her performance too once!
I love her. She is so brave.
She's incredible!
