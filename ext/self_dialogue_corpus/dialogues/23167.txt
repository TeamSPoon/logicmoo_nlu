Want to get the kids together for a movie this weekend?
It depends whats playing. Zoe can be pretty picky about movies.
Hmm, let me check whats playing.
Sounds good.
Alright, Dispicable 3 and Cars 3 are playing on Saturday.
Despicable Me was really cute, did your kids like it.
Yeah, they loved it and the second one.
What about cars?
They liked that one too.
Did they like the second one?
Yeah, but it wasn't as good as the first.
Hmm, I'm not sure which one we should go see. What do you think?
I think the kids will like either. Despicable 3 will probably be the easiest one for us to sit through.
Yeah cars is kind of boring.
Okay, should I get tickets for Despicable 3?
Yes lets go see that one.
Cool, I'm excited
Me too, the kids will be stoked.
Alright I got tickets for the 3 pm Saturday showing.
Sounds great. We'll be there.
