Are you ready to watch my Giants dominate this year?
No way! The Eagles are definitely going all the way this year!
You say that every year! Last year you didn't even make the playoffs!
That was then, this is now. We have Alshon Jeffrey, Torrey Smith, and LeGarrette Blount. You're going to see a brand new offense this year.
But we have Odell Beckam Jr, Sherling Shepard, and we just got Brandon Marshall. You can't compete with that.
Okay, if you're so confident let's see you put your money where your mouth is.
I should be asking you that question. I'm always confident in my team.
Okay, so let's bet. $100 says the Eagles will make it further than your Giants.
Okay, you have yourself a deal. Be ready to pay up!
No way man, you're the one that's going to have to pay up.
Okay. We'll see what happens.
Trust me, it's going to happen. And we're definitely dominating the Cowboys this year too.
We beat the Cowboys twice last year, I'm not worried about them.
That last one was a close game, I wouldn't get so cocky if I were you.
I'm not being cocky, just being confident. Dez Bryant had a great year, there's no denying that. But he's still a rookie and has a lot to learn.
I can agree with that, he definitely has a lot to learn.
I'm interested to see how he performs this year, but like I said I'm confident in my team.
So am I! I can feel it, this is going to be the year for my Eagles.
You really do live in a fantasy world.
We'll see about that come September.
