What do you like more? The beginning of the NFL season, or the end.
I love the beginning of the season.
Why? The end of the season is just one big party.
Yeah, but the beginning of the season holds so much possibility.
Possibility for what?
Possibility for everything and everyone.
I'm going to need some examples.
In the beginning of the season, you don't know if there is going to be a Cnderella team who is just magically good.
I guess you have a point..
You also don't know which rookies are going to have amazing seasons.
Yeah, I guess the speculation around that is pretty fun.
In the beginning of the season you get to have a NFL fantasy draft too, and that comes with it's own possibilities.
I don't really like fantasy football, I just like watching the football games on tv,
Well, regardless, for other people that's still one of the things.
Okay, yeah I guess. But the end of the season is so fun.
Not for everyone.
What do you mean?
It's not fun if your team doesn't make the playoffs.
I didn't think about that.
I guess it's okay to like either.
