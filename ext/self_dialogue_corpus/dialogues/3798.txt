There is nothing good on television tonight!
I know, we could just find a movie to watch.
I want to watch some kind of a thriller!
Have you seen What Lies Beneath?
Is that the one with Harrison Ford in it?
Yea he stars in it with Michelle Pfieffer.
What is it about exactly?
I won't give away to much, but let's just say you will not see the ending coming.
Well I am ready to watch it now!
Great, I think you will really enjoy it.
