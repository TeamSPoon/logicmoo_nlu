Are you  a Seth Rogen fan?
Some of his work, so yes.
Which do you like best?
Pineapple express. It is such a funny movie and he is great in that role.
I like it but prefer This is the end.
That one may take the cake actually.
Right? It is so funny.
He did get his start in comedy/standup so it only makes sense for him to be funny.
True, did you know he is Canadian?
Yes, hails from Vancouver right?
I think so makes sense for all the pot humor.
Ha, well legal now in california too.
I wonder if he will get into more serious roles.
I hope not. I love him for his humor and great comedic timing.
Sometimes I enjoy seeing actors change it up though.
Maybe, but if you have a niche or working formula why change it?
True, but isn't that how type casting is in general.
Well there is a reason it exists, people have types.
I disagree a little. I think everyone is so multifaceted. If given the chance.
Maybe but I will always love him as comedy guy.
