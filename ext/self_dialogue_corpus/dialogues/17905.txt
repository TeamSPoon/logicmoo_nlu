Do you like to listen to live music?
I do, although it is sometimes too loud for me.
Yeah, concerts can be really loud.
Do you wear ear protection at concerts?
If I go I sometimes I do.
I never wore ear protecion but my ears have ended up ringing afterwards.
It's a good idea while listening to loud music.
My drum instructor said the cymbals can cause some hearing damage.
I guess he wears protection on stage.
Yes, when he plays the band does protect themselves often.
I see that on TV too.
I heard that you can damage your hearing with something louder than a vacuum cleaner.
That's probably true.
It still doesn't take away from the awesome feeling of loud music.
Yeah, we used to cruise around town as kids blasting our music.
I remember those days.
I'm not sure they allow that so much anymore.
Too many people were awoken and complained.
Too bad.
Well, I guess we were rebels with our music.
