Why are you such a big star wars fan?
i love the legecy and I think the story is fun
Which version of the story do you like
I loved the reboots, starting from episode one
Aren't those known as the worst ones
Honestly i like them better
why is that
because the special effect are better and the story moves faster
then i guess you aren't a fan of the empire strikes back era
no i like it, just not as much as the new stuff
