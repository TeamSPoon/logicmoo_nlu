Where is the theater?
Why are you seeing a show?
Yes, I am going to see the new ghost busters, I hear it is really funny.
It is but can kind of get preachy about it's feministic values.
I won't mind, are there any hot actors.
Yea, I don't know his name but he plays there secretary and god is he a hunk.
Well all movies need some eye candy and some movies need to have really hot guys.
I don't think they used makeup on him, he is just that good looking naturally.
Wow, that is possible, I thought that movie had too much CGI at the end.
I can kinda see that the whole end sequence was computer generated.
Why do they do that when it really can ruin a move.
I think it is for expense mostly but also some visual effects aren't possible without computers.
What did you think about the fact that they tried to have all the original cast in it?
Well some of it was a streach, but I really like Bill Murry so I was cool with that.
What was a theme of that film?
I think it is about how anyone with enough motivation can, in a world with ghosts, become a ghostbuster
Well that is a silly theme, I was thinking more along the lines of female empowerment and individual freedoms.
That could be it too but I think it is more about finding ghosts.
Yes that is the plot but I was wondering what other themes there may be
Well perhaps one about how humanity would be better off with ghost and we all die.
