Have you seen any movies in the theater lately?
No, I usually don't catch too many in the theaters.  What about you?
No but I'm excited to see a few coming out.
Oh really, which ones?
Despicable Me 3, my kids love the minions.
Haha, yeah mine too.
The House looks funny too.
Yes, I always love a good Will Ferrell movie!
Me too!
Baby Driver looks good to me, do you know anything about that?
No, I've seen previews though. It does look good.
It reminds me of that Nicolas Cage movie about cars.
Oh, Gone in 60 Seconds?
Yes, that one.  That was a good movie.
Yeah, I liked that one.  There were a lot of good actors in that one.
Definitely.
Are you interested in that movie, Rough Night?
Is that the one with all the really funny girls, kind of like Bridesmaids?
Yes.
Yeah, that looks hilarious.
