I am so sick of watching Frozen.
Tell me about it!
I swear my daughter has watched it atleast a hundred times.
Mine too. I need to get her into something else lol.
Yeah, I miss old disney movies.
So do I.
What was your favorite as a kid?
Definitely the little mermaid, I used to watch it over and over.
That was a good one, maybe I can convince my daughter to give it a try.
What about you, what was your favorite?
I really liked Mulan and the Lion King.
Oh! I forgot about that one, that was so good!
Yeah, the songs were so catchy!
Yeah! We should get the kids together to have a movie marathon!
That would be fun! Have your kids seen the CROODS?
No was it good?
Oh yeah it was really cute!
Cool we can add it to the list if you think the kids will like it.
Yeah they should it reminds me a lot of Ice Age.
Oh that was a really good one too, we should add that to the list.
