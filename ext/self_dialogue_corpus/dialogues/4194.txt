I like thrillers that have a political angle. Things like All The President's Men or Blow Out. Some older ones, but still good.
Yeah, political can be good. Even something like WarGames, the old one with Matthew Broderick, could be considered political.
Oh sure. After all, it was about nuclear war. That's pretty political.
I also really like thriller movies that are reality-based. Stuff like Erin Brockovich starring Julia Roberts, which was based on a true story.
Oh, she was so good in that. Good example of a movie that could have been boring but was actually great.
Very true. Oh, another good example of an old one that still stands up: The China Syndrome.
Yeah, that was from the seventies, wasn't it? That movie scared the heck out of me.
Yet, 1979, I think. Scared me, too.
Did you ever see The Fugitive? That's a thriller, isn't it?
I think so. An action thriller, at least.
