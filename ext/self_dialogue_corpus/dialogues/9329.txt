Alright, greatest rapper of 2017, go!
Wow! Put me on the spot there ..... I'll say Drake.
Really? To be honest I haven't heard any of his new album.
You haven't listened to More Views? What are you doing with your life, Passionfruit is a bop!
I don't know, I guess these days I'm really into these Chicago rappers.
Oh like Kanye?
Well of course Kanye is always included, but more like Chance the Rapper and Noname Gypsy.
Noname Gypsy? Who is that?
What? She's such an amazing rapper, I don't know what it is she's got this cool and calm flow.
Oh so like Chance? I guess that city really breeds talent -- I'll check her out.
