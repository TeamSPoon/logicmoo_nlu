Do you think Tom Brady was legitimately guilty in the deflation scandal?
I'm not sure, but I don't really care.
Do you like him?
Yeah, I'm fine with him. He plays the position better than anyone.
Why do so many hate him? Jealousy?
No, no one ever hates someone out of jealousy. That's silly.
So why?
They hate him because he's a perfect city boy from up north who does well.
So?
So...who is the primary watcher of the NFL?
Men?
No, generalize a type of individual.
I don't know what you're getting at.
Rednecks. Rednecks love football, and they love their good ol boys from the SEC succeeding, not a handsome guy from Michigan.
Ahh. What about the rest of the team?
The only person I hate is Bill Belichick.
Me too.
He's such a curmudgeon and a bully.
True, I hope they win, but without him.
Good thought!
