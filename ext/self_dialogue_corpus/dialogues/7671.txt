So what did Harry think Sirius was really going to do if he lived?
I don't think Harry even thought that far. He has delusions of grandeur.
Totally. Sirius was just a regular guy, not a white knight.
I guess to Harry everything was better than the Dursley's.
He really doesn't realize how good he had it there. I mean he got everything he needed plus the protection from his mother.
You're right. He never does seem truly grateful for them.
It could have been much worse.
I know. He could have lived with all those kids at the Weasley's.
Harry even eventually got his own room.
It was nice too. They eventually left him alone and let him do his thing.
