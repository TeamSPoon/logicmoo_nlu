Are you a Philip Glass fan?
No way, man that guy is crazy
What do you mean?
I mean, his music is so repetitive and boring
I know a lot of people feel that way, but you may not have heard enough of his work to make a fair judgment. He's written a ton of stuff and it doesn't all sound like that
Okay, if you say so
You should check out some more of his stuff before coming to a conclusion. The guy is a genius
Maybe I will. Any recommendations?
Sure, listen to a string quarted perform the closing from Mishima. Or listen to Paul Barnes play "Orphee and the Princess" on piano
Thanks, I might check them out.
Also the piano Etudies, no. 8 and 16 are a couple of my favorites and are not too repetitive.
Cool. I will look for them on YouTube.
Great. Let me know what you think.
I will. Generally i've preferred older classical music, you know the typical Mozart and Chopin and stuff, but i'm open to new things.
I get that. I just happen to think Glass is the Mozart of our time, and believe it or not, im not the only one
Maybe he is!
Definitely one of the greatest composers of our time, no doubt about that
I will take your word for it
You should. Cause i know more about music than you do.
Haha! True that.
