Anakin Skywalker must be saved
Uh..he kind of killed a bunch of people.
Yeah, but he saves the day! He's a tortured soul.
Okay. So is Kylo Ren, but I don't care about his greasy self.
Really? Even after everything he's been through?
Okay, what has he been through? I get Anakin, but what has Kylo Ren been through?
He lost his father!
He killed his father, you're out.
He's cute.
You're going to hell.
