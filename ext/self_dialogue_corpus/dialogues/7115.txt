Do you enjoy the really old Disney movies?
I love 'Bambi' especially.
That's a beautiful movie the way they illustrated the forests.
Yes, I love how the scenery looks with the old animation.
I do find that movie extremely sad though.
I think everyone does when his mother dies.
I guess that was important for kids to see and learn about.
Yes, there are some interesting life lessons throughout Disney movies.
I just wish I didn't have to feel like crying every time I watch it.
That's exactly the way I feel, but I push though and savor the rest of the film.
