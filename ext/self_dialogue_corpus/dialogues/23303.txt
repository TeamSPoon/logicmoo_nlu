Have you seen the last of the “Hunger Games” movies?
I don’t think so.  Is it out now?
It was out in 2015.  It was based on the third book.
I saw at least the first couple.  Who was the author of the books?
Suzanne Collins was the author of the series.
Was Jennifer Lawrence in them?
She was, and Liam Hemsworth was too.
I remember watching Elizabeth Banks, she had really cool costumes.
Yeah, her makeup was kind of bizarre too. All the makeup of the people in the city was odd, but cool.
Who else famous was in them?
Woody Harrelson was the other famous person I liked alot.  He played a crusty old drunk dude, who was the coach of the kids.
Did any of the franchise movies win any awards?
I think Jennifer won a Critics Choice Award for the first one.
Any other awards?
One of the songs in the first one won a Grammy, and it was the favorite movie for the People’s Choice Award.
How many movies were in the series?
Four, but there were three books.
Why where there four movies?
They did it like the Harry Potter ones, the last books in the series got split in half.
Okay, I don’t think I saw all four of them. I did see at least two though.
