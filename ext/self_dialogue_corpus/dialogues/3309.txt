What's the wirst horror film you've ever seen?
Worst would have to be Uncle Sam. It was about a veteran that came back from the dead and wrecked havoc, just awful.
Ha I've seen that one, my pick would have to be Troll 2.
No way Troll 2 is amazing in a so bad it's good sort of way.
I saw nothing redeeming in it and the acting, my God!
Well when one of the main characters is a real life dentist with zero acting credits, what were you expecting, Al Pacino?
Well no of course not, but I wasn't expecting George Hardy either.
Don't be so hard on poor George the dentist.
Maybe I should give it another watch, it has to be fair been years.
Absolutely you should, just remember that Nilbog is Goblin spelled backwards, you will understand if you don't remember that line.
