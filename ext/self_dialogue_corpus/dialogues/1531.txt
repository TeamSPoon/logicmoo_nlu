Training camps are starting for NFL football soon.  I'm already getting excited!
Me, too.  I can't wait to keep watching the Browns lose this year.
You're still a Browns fan?  That's nice of you.
I know, I  know.  I think they made some good draft picks this year.  Finally.
Don't you say that every year?  Who did they get, again?
Myles Garrett and Jabrill Peppers.
Those are good picks.  If they use them correctly.  Which they never seem to do.
This is true. Hopefully they'll make good decisions when it comes to quarterbacks this year.
Who do you think will start this season?
Good question.  They have four choices.  I read they're going to give them all an opportunity to show off and then go from there.
They drafted a quarterback this year didn't they?
Yes.  DeShone Kizer in the second round.
Not bad.  Who else do they have to chose from?
Cody Kessler, Brock Ossweiler, and Kevin Hogan.
The Browns are always lousy with quarterbacks.
True. That's why I think Myles Garrett was a great use of their first draft pick.
How about RG III?  Is he still there?
He is.  I think they just need to make better use of him.
It seems like every year is a rebuilding year for the Browns.
Maybe so.  But hey, if we win two games this year, it will be an improvement!
