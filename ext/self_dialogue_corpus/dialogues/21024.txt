It is by far the greatest anime film of all time. How can you not have seen it?
Well, excuse me, I'm not that into Japanese anime. I don't care if you think kitana or whatever is the best
Akira, not kitana. Katana is a japanese sword. There is no such thing as kitana. And Why not?
They speak Japanese. I don't speak Japanese. I hate French films too.
That why they have subtitles!!!
If I want to read at the movies, I'll bring a book.
So for you, only the English language movies are acceptable?
No, of course not, They can dub the foreign films. I don't care.
But that removes all the nuances of the speech from the actors. That kills the film.
I think you take films way too seriously. Take a chill pill.
What?!?!? The acting is all about the movements, the facial expression, body language, hand gesture and yes voice! Without that, the acting isn't acting at all!
And voice dubs ARE done by actors, not by the original actors, but those who can SPEAK English!
Gahhhh. I have no idea why I even talk to you.
You started it. I'm just stating my well informed and very tolerant opinion.
No, if you reject foreign films based on language, that's not being tolerant.
Bah, nonsense. Of course it is. I said I would watch it if it's dubbed.
See that spork? I am going to take that spork and stab you with it.
That's so mature. You're just angry because you lost an argument
i did NOT lose an argument let alone THIS argument!
Blah, blah. blah.
