Who was your favorite at the Golden Globes last night?
Hmmm, tough question....I would have to go with Jennifer Garner!
Ohhh, good choice. She looked simply stunning in that red Vera Wang gown, didn't she?
Amazing is more like it!
And Emma Watson! Her shoes were just killer!
They were! I don't know how she even walked in heels that high, but she pulled it off flawlessly!
I noticed another trend on the carpet last night too didn't you, in regards to the colors?
Oh yes, jewel tones ruled the night didn't they? Reds, purples, blues and greens. It was enchanting to say the least!
Such a romantic old Hollywood feel I thought.
Oh yes, definetly!
And what were your thoughts on the gentlemen's attire?
The ladies were the talk of the night, but I felt like the men did their job as well.
So many stylish suits and smart accessories I thought. Leonardo DiCaprio comes to my mind first, he was so suave, was he not?
Swoon! I agree, so many dashing men to complement all of the fancy gowns and ladies.
I would call that another successful night in the books, wouldn't you?
Oh yes, 100%! I can only imagine how hard it will be to top the fashion of this years awards next year!
Oh, i'm sure it will be done. That's one thing I have learned about Hollywood, it's not one to be outdone. Even by itself!
Haha! Oh yes, I can't wait!
Until next year then!
Have a great night everyone!
