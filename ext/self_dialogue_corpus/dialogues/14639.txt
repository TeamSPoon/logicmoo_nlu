Did you watch the game between the Celtics and Wizards last night?
Of course! It was the only NBA game on last night.
Yes, that's right.  All the other series are decided.
Yes.  It was a great game though.
Did you think the Wizards would be able to pull it out?
It was really looking bad for them at the end there.  The Celtics had the lead.
I agree.  I thought the Wizards season was over at that point.
Yes, it was some extremely clutch basketball by them at the end of the game.
John Wall is just an amazing player.
Agreed.  He hit the game winner.
I don't think Wall gets the recognition he deserves like other point guards.
Agreed.  It's all about Harden and Westbrook this season, but Wall might be a more complete pure point guard.
Even in this series, it's mostly been about Isaiah Thomas.
I mean that's fair, Thomas has been absolutely amazing.
But so has Wall, right?
Yes, both have been playing some amazing basketball.
Okay, so what do you think happens in Game 7?
You have to go with the home team, especially in Boston.  All that history!
That being said, Game 7s are always a bit of a crapshoot.
Agreed.  All I know is I will be watching!
