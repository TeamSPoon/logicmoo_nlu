Do you like Jazz music.
Not really, do you?
It is okay but not my favorite at all if I had to pick.
I did like Louis Armstrong.
Yes he was good.
My sister used to be scared of him when he came on the radio.
That is funny.
I think it was the song Hello Dolly.
How about Dizzy Guillepsie?
All I know about him is that he was a trumpet player.
Yea I do not know too much about jazz music but never cared for it much.
There was also Count Basie.
Oh yea, he was a pianist and a band leader for years.
I think he wrote April in Paris.
Yea there were a lot of good big bands back in the thirties, forties and fifties.
Yea but that was before my time.
Mine too.
Maybe I should learn more about them.
You might find you like them more.
Maybe!
