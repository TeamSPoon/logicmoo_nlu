The first new star wars movie was better than the second
I mean i cannot fully agree
it felt more original
Well it was the start of a new trilogy
Well obviously it was that why it is better
It just means they had to be more original
The movie rogue one just feels to fan servicey to me
Is that a bad thing though
I guess not in its entirety
Well gotta look at them for what they are
