Hows things?
Not too bad.
Plans for the weekend?
Not real sure.
Want to come over and listen to some tunes?
That sounds alright.
Cool!
Throw on some of the oldies?
But goodies!
No doubt!
No, not that band!
I was just agreeing to "goodies".
Ha! My bad!
But what wrong with No Doubt.
Nothing. Just don't care for Gwenn.
Well, not these days, but she used to be pretty good.
Till she got into Hip Hop.
More...Pop.
Well, whatever it is, I don't like it.
Agreed!
