Is Dead Man's Chest out yet?
It's in theaters I think
I hope I get to see it
it's a great time period movie
I hate that Orlando Bloom and Kiera Knightly aren't in it anymore
Yeah, I'm not sure why they left them out
The series has made a ton of money.
Yeah, the individual films all did well.
I wonder if they'lll make any more movies off Disney rides
They should
