Did the 49ers fire Chip Kelly last year?
Yes, thank goodness for us fans.
He may have been a good college coach, but he was a terrible pro coach.
He just had one gimmick that got figured out.
It worked for a little while with teams being caught off guard.
But then coaches started to learn how to counter it.
Once that happened everyone just copied the formula.
Chip wasn't that creative.
No, he thought the system trumped everything.
He only ran a handful of plays.
In some of his games when he coached the Eagles it got to the point opposing defenses were calling out plays.
These guys knew the play before it happened?
Yes.  That's how predictable he got.
Unbelievable yet he still insisted on doing the same thing.
And, he didn't know how to use his players.
He kept trying to fit players into his system not the other way around according to their talents.
Not to mention his style killed his own defense.
These guys were on the field all game getting worn down.
Especially if the offense sputtered it was a rapid three and out.
And then even if they did score if was only a short rest for the defense.  No time of possession.
