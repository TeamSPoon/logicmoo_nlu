Do you think La La Land should have won best picture this year?
Yes, I loved that movie!
What was your favorite song from that movie?
I like the song Emma Stone sings during the audition.
Me too, but I like City of Stars better.
I liked that one a lot too. That movie was perfect in every way.
I feel like there haven't been enough musical movies out lately.
Yeah, I know what you mean.
Can you think of the last big one that was out before that?
I'm not sure, maybe Les Miserables?
Yeah, I think you're right. I liked that lone a lot, but it was a long movie.
It was long, but definitely a good movie.
What did you like about it?
I liked that it was pretty much solid singing the whole movie. There was almost no dialogue that wasn't singing.
I liked that aspect of it as well.
Did you cry at the end of Les Mis?
Oh, of course! I can't stand when Hugh Jackman's character dies!
I cried too. It's a really emotional movie.
I know, but we should totally watch it this weekend.
Okay, I'd be up for watching it!
