Have you ever heard of the band Boston?
Yes, but I don't know much about their music.
They were really famous in the 70's and 80's.
What kind of music did they play?
Rock and some people called some of their stuff Rock Opera.  I think of it as all rock though.
Did they have some big hits I might have heard of?
Sure did, I bet you have heard of "More Than a Feelin"
Yes, I have heard of that.
Their albums were usually concept albums, with artwork and songs about space ships, space travel, etc.
Yes!  I remember seeing the big saucer like space ship with like fire under it taking off!
That's them alright!  Can you think of any songs you remember them doing?
Gee, I think I remember a song called "Don' Look Back"
Yes, that was one of their biggest hits too!  Another one was "Cool The Engines"
I remember it, and that makes sense.  Kind of like cool the engines when your spaceship gets where it is going.
True, I never thought of it that way, but you are right!  One of my favorites is "Don't Look Back"
I have heard of that one too, guess I knew more of their music than I thought!
Well their music is still played on the radio today.  Mostly on classic rock stations and oldies stations.
So are the band members from Boston?
They sure are, which is why the name "Boston".
I figured they had to be from there, no one would dare to use a name like that without being from the area!
