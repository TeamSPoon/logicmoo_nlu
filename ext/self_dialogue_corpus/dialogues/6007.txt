What is your favorite Disney movie?
The little mermaid. I love the story and the soundtrack of that movie.
Yeah, it has some really good songs. Which one is your favorite?
Kiss the girl, from the scene where Ariel and prince Erik almost kiss during their boat ride.
Oh, I remember that scene. Romantic and comic at the same time.
Yeah, I love how Disney movies can express so many different emotions at the same time. And their stories usually have a good message too.
I think the message of The little mermaid would be that true love is worth sacrificing for.
I agree. It will always be my childhood favorite.
What was your favorite character in the movie by the way?
Ariel, of course. I adored her long, red hair and her amazing voice.
