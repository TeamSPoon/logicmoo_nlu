Have you watched the latest Pirates of the Caribbean movie?
No, I haven't.
Why not? I liked it.
I lost interest after the third one.
I guess they did change a lot of the characters, not everyone likes that.
Yeah, I like the dynamic between Keira Knightly and Orlando Bloom.
Johnny Depp is pretty good though.
He is, but I'm not a huge fan. Him on his own is not enough to keep bringing me back.
He has enough fans to keep a major franchise going for over a decade though.
Yeah, a lot of girls are obsessed with him. He's aged very well.
