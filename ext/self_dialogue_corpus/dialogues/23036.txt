You have to watch that movie "Waking Ned Devine".
Why?
For one, it's hilarious, and two, it's on the Man of Isle and you love Ireland so it's right up your alley.
So it has Irish humor?
It absolutely has Irish humor which is the main reason it's so freaking good.
That sounds cool, but what's it about?
Ok, you know how everyone says, 'If I won the lottery I'd die of a heart attack'?
Yeah, I probably would, too.
Ok, well, that's pretty much the plot of the movie.
What?  Someone dies because they won the lottery?
Yes!  Ned dies of shock when he realizes he's won the lottery.
Ok, so how does that become a movie?
Keep in mind that we are talking Irish humor here.
Ok, but I still want to know how that becomes an entire movie.
When Ned dies, everyone in town finds out that he won the lottery, and the devise a plan to fool the lottery office in to handing over the winnings anyway.
Who is going to get the winnings?
The entire town is in on it.
Are you serious, the entire town tries to steal the lottery winnings from a dead man?
That's exactly right.
I totally have to see that movie.
