What do you think about Director Kevin Smith?
I am not sure I've seen one of his films in awhile.
Yes, his latest movies like Yoga Hosers have been strange, but still pretty funny.
OK - Johnny Depp's daughter is in that film, right?
Yes, and Depp is also in it!
Really?   I don't remember him in the advertisements.
Yes, he plays a character with a funny nose in all those movies.
All?     He appeared in some other Smith films?
Yes, the current series includes at least a scene or two with Depp in each one.
Wow!     That's news to me!
What about his older movies?
I remember that black and White One.
Yeah, Clerks was his first movie.
Yeah, that's it.     Isn't there some story behind it?
Yes, he paid for it himself, and sold his stuff to make it.
That's cool.     It shows determination.
Not just determination, but it made a career!
I agree with that.       Which is your favorite?
I like the one with Ben Affleck and the cute blonde lead.    Chasing Amy.
That love story one?     Geeky and with a cute girl?    I am in.
