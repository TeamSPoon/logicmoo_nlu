Do you know the artist "Delerium"?
No, what do they sound like.
It's really hard to describe.
How so?
They are more like DJs.
What do you mean?
They use a lot of samples.
That's not impressive!
Actually, it is.
How is just sampling music impressive?
They are really good at it!
Oh, but still.
They are aware of your criticism.
Yeah, how so?
They stopped sampling and started briging in talent.
Really?
Yeah, they brought in a lot of famous people.
Like who?
Like, Sarah McLachlan.
Wow! I love her!
