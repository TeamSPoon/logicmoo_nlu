Hey what's your favorite original trilogy star wars movie?
I think I liked Empire Strikes back the most
Any particular reason?
I think because it had a dark tone and a non happy ending.
Yeah it seems more realistic that way.
I also like the classic scenes of the snow speeder battle and AT ATs.
Also who could forget about Darth Vader being Luke's father?
Yeah that was one of the biggest surprises of the decade.
Yeah; I also liked the scenes in Cloud City.
You forgot about Dagobah and Yoda!
