I also like the Dallas Cowboys.
There defense if going to have to play better than last season.
I don't think the defense is going to matter much.
You win championships with defense.
I don't know last year your Patriots won by scoring points.
True, but they also shut out the Falcons in the second half of the super bowl.
I am sure the Cowboys will have a better defense than last years Patriots.
Why would you think that?
Because they drafted Taco Charlton.  How could you not believe in a guy named Taco.
One guy don't make a defense.
They think they drafted well on the defensive secondary also.
It is hard to trust a rookie is going to make a big difference.
Don't tell that to Dak Prescott and Ezekial Elliott.
That was lighting in a bottle and not something you should expect every year.
I still think they have to be considered front runners for the Super Bowl.
It is a long season and they have to avoid the injuries.
That is true with any team plus I think they have solid depth.
That is how the Patriots are so good year in and year out.
They are a very deep team but they are getting old.
People say that every season.
