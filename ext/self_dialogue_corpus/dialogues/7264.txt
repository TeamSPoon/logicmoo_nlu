Remember the old Wonderful World of Disney TV show that used to come on every Sunday when we were kids?
No doubt. I always made a point to see it.
Walt Disney hosted it and I thought he was so cool back then.
Me, too.
Remember the Heidi controversy?
What was that?
It was Superbowl Sunday and a really close game was being played ....
Yes, and.....?
And it went into overtime but the station cut it off to play the movie Heidi People nearly rioted.
I remember hearing about that now that you mention it!
