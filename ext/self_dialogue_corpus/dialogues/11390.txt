I just listened to The Beatles on my iPod...their music is so great!
I know...classic.  I don't think anyone has been able to recreate what they had.
The Monkees were similar...but not as good.  You're right.
What is your favorite Beatles song?
"Hey Jude" but I also love John Lennon's "Beautiful Boy"  I sing that song to my son all the time.
Great songs!  I like some of their later music.
Like the Abbey Road album?
Exactly!  "Here Comes the Sun" just makes me smile.  I love that song!
I like "Come Together" probably the best off of that album.
That's a great song too!
