Which decade do you think had the best rap?
2000-2010.
Why is that?
There were so many rappers to listen to and the ones still around today were at their best.
Yeah, I feel like there were a ton more rappers back then.
We had Nelly, Ludacris, Nas, TI, Jeezy, Jay Z, Eminem, D12, etc.
Lots of them still rap.
Barely. Eminem releases songs occasionally, but the rest have mostly stopped.
50 cent was at his best then, too.
Yeah, in da club is a classic.
Also, all the one hit wonders.
Young Joc, Petey Pablo, Chingy.
And the lean with it, rock with it guys.
Also the guy with 'i'm hot cuz i'm fly, you ain't cuz you're not'
That guy was corny.
Yeah, but that song was definitely his only hit.
I don't even remember his name.
I remember a lot of songs from people that I can't name the artist of.
Chris Jones was a one hit in the 00's
281-330-8004. Everyone knew that phone number.
