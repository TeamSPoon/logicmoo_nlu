I just watched 21 Jump Street.
The movie or the TV show?
The movie.
What did you think?
It was pretty good, a lot better than I expected.
Really? I'm usually not a fan of the TV show movie adaptations.
Well, they don't take themselves seriously and it's not heavy like the TV show, at all.
So it's a comedy then?
Yes, very much so.
Who's in it again?
Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill are the leads.
I like Hill a lot. Seems like an odd combo though.
Yeah, they play that up quite a bit.
So is it like the show where they go undercover into high school?
Yes, that parts the same.
Both those guys seem a little old for high school.
Indeed they are and that gets pointed out quite a bit.
That's pretty funny, think I might check it out.
You should, it will provide a few chuckles.
Cool, I'm always on the lookout for something funny.
