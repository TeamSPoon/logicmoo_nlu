We watched the entire Rocky movie set this weekend.
Wow, that's a lot of movies.
Yes, but those movies are great.
They are.
Which one was your favorite?
Has to be the first one.
Me too.
The second best to me is when Apollo dies.
That is sad.
That Russian fighter isn't a likeable person.
Definitely not.
Mr. T wasn't either.
I know.
The one where he trained that young guy wasnt a favorite.
Not for me either.
Just didn't seem like a Rocky movie.
I know.
His wife really is pretty.
Yes after she took the glasses off, she looked different.
Good actress too.
