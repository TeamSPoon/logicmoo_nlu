The football season is coming up.
Right; it's been a long time.
Can you believe that Super Bowl? It was the best ever!
Right; I almost missed it. And that Lady Gaga jumped off the bleeping roof at halftime; that had to be the best halftime show too.
It was choice when Roger Goodell got booed handing out the trophy.
That's what he gets. He was just a chauffer for that other guy.
Yeah, I bet he can't even go out to dinner in public with his wife.
If he has one!
You think they will do it again?
I don't know; I mean all Atlanta had to do was run the ball at the end and they would have won.
Right, but they didn't have Gronk or that other guy.
Whatever, I mean I wouldn't bet against it.
Have to check the schedule anyway. Maybe it is easy.
Doesn't matter. You can just pencil them into the playoffs, and everyone knows it.
It would help if Philly or New York were any good.
Man, that Eli is a train wreck.
He got it done twice.
Yeah, even Joe Namath didn't do that!
You're crazy, man!
Don't forget about Romo!
