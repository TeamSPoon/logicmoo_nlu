how about that force awakens?
i thought it was okay.
Didn't it seem like a copy of a new hope?
yeah, i guess it was kind of a reboot
I thought it was more of a straight up copy.
Nah, I think they're just trying to catch the attention of a new generation of fans
I guess that's true.
It's not like it was a horrible movie either.
Yeah, but I hope the next movie tells us much more.
I'm sure it will; the backstory of Rey.
