I like the first two Fast & Furious movies the best.
I liked them all pretty much.
Did you like Paul Walker?
Yes for sure.
It was a shame when he died him and Vin Diesel together made those movies.
I know and to die in a car.
His brother stepped in for one of the movies.
Did you see that one.
Yes I did.
I think they did a good job with what they had to work with.
