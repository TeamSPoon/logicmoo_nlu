Are there any NFL teams you route against?
Of course!
Really? I didn't take you as that much of a hardcore fan.
I'm more of a casual fan: I watch when it's on, but I don't care too much.
So who do you root against?
The Giants, the Jets, the Steelers, and the Cowboys.
Why those?
The Giants and Jets because in every sport I root against New York-based teams. That and I hate Eli Manning.
So why the Steelers? You're from Pennsylvania.
Right, the eastern side. Born a Philly fan.
But they're not even the same conference.
Yeah, but Big Ben is a horrible person who has been involved in accidents and a heck of a lot of sexual assaults.
Yeah, he's sketchy. So why America's team?
Precisely that. The arrogance of calling themselves America's team.
You probably hate the Super Bowl, then right?
How so?
Because the winner is the World Champion.
I HATE THAT SO MUCH.
Haha, I know you would.
American pro sports and arrogance go together so well, don't they. Especially the NFL.
