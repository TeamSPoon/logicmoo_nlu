I am so bored right now!
Me to, how about we listen to some music?
That sounds fun, but we should listen to something a little different!
How about we listen to something old school?
Remember when we used to love boy bands back in high school?
Yes! The nineties was the best decade ever for boy bands.
I agree, we truly grew up in the golden era of boy band prominence.
I say we should listen to some our favorite nineties boy band songs!
Sounds like a party to me! Should we start with some Backstreet Boys?
I don't know, I was kind of thinking NSYNC would be where we start.
Sounds fine to me! Can I choose the song?
Sure, which one do you want to listen to?
I love Bye Bye Bye, and This I promise You the best.
Those are both awesome songs, what about Tearin' Up My Heart?
I had forgot about that one! Either of those songs are fine with me!
Besides the Backstreet Boys and NSYNC, what were some other popular boy bands from the nineties?
Have you forgot about Hanson and 98 Degrees?
I have not thought about those groups in such a long time!
Me either, but it is fun to think back on music we used to love.
I agree, we should do this much more often!
