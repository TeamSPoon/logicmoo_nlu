I feel like talking basketball.
Yeah, me too.
So, you been watching the games much?
Well, I tried to keep up with Notre Dame, but they're not doing so great.
Really?
Yeah, I mean, they lost four of their last five games, including two at home to two ranked teams
Wow, that's not very good.
No, it isn't, and it's pretty discouraging as a big fan of the team.
Can't be all hopeless, though, huh?
Well, Mooney isn't doing to bad.  Been pretty excited to see him on the floor.
Yeah, I've seen him, that guy is TALL, even for a basketball player.
Yeah, I believe he's like six foot nine or so.
Well, could definitely catch some rebounds.
That's for sure.
Maybe they need a change in strategy.
Yeah, I think so... heard some people suggesting they try the 1-4 offensive set
You think that would work?
At this point, it couldn't hurt but that, to me, isn't the real problem.
What is?
I think they keep passing on "good" shots to try and get "even better" shots.  Sometimes, you just gotta cut loose.
