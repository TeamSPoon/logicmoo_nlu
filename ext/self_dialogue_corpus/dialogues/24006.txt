Are you a fan of Adam Sandler?
Yes, I am. I've seen almost all of his movies, most of them multiple times.
What's your favorite Sandler film of all time?
Oh wow that's a really hard choice, there's so many. I don't think I can choose just one.
Okay, what would you say are the five best Sandler movies?
Let me see. In no order: Little Nicky, Big Daddy, Grown Ups, Jack and Jill, That's My Boy. And honorable mention goes to The Ridiculous Six.
Jack and Jill? Is that the one where Adam Sandler plays a twin brother and sister?
Yes, that's it. Have you seen it? It's hilarious!
I haven't seen it but I heard it's funny. What's the storyline?
The brother, Jack is a rich man and his twin sister, Jill, drives him out of his mind when she comes to visit him.
That sounds really funny.
Oh it is, every scene in that movie is funny. And Al Pacino is in it too!
No kidding? That sounds like a strange type of film for Pacino to be in.
You'll think it's even stranger when I tell you Pacino falls in love with the female twin.
Played by Adam Sandler? Oh wow, I think I have to see this movie!
Yes, you certainly do, if you're in the mood to laugh your face off!
I noticed you only mentioned one of Sandler's early movies, Big Daddy, in your top five.
Yes, I'm not too crazy about his really early films. It's mostly the later stuff that I think is hysterical.
You didn't like The Water Boy?
Oh come on, even you have to admit, that was terrible!
