I know I watched it, but I don't remember the movie Dumbo.
I really don't either.
I had to be a kid when I saw it.
Me too. Do any of your kids have the DVD?
Actually, no.
We should see if they still sell it.
I would really like to watch it.
Does Dumbo's mom get taken away or killed?
I really don't know.
We've got to find it so we can watch it as adults.
