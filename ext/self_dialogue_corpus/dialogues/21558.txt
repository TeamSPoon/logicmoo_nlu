Did you see Hidden Figures yet?
No, I really wanted to though.  Was it good?
I really liked it.  I had no idea that African American women worked for NASA back then.
I like Octavia Spencer a lot.
Yeah, she's really good.  I can never see her in anything though without thinking of that movie The Help.
Oh I know especially that part where she feeds that woman the pie!
That part was hilarious. Speaking of The Help did you see Emma Stone in La La Land.
I haven't seen that yet but I'm dying to.
That director really is going places.
Who directed it?
Damien Chazelle.  He also directed Whiplash so he must really have a thing for music.
I loved Whiplash!  I never have played in a band or anything but something about that movie kept me tense the entire time.
J.K. Simmons completely took that role and owned it.  Man he was amazing.
I know!  On one hand you hated him and on the other you kind of understood what he was doing.
Miles Teller did a great job as well.
I thought he was really good in Bleed for This but I'm not sure that many people saw that one.
I didn't see it.  What was it about?
It's about a boxer that was in a car crash and was told he probably wouldn't even walk again came back and won the title.
That sounds like a good one.  Sometimes though these inspirational sports movies are kind of done to death.
This one is a true story though.
