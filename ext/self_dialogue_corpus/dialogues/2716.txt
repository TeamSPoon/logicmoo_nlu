I never know what to make of the NFC Central. Do you?
They used to call them the Black and Blue division because of how gritty they were.
Maybe nobody's gritty anymore. I don't know.
So you think the Packers will win that division?
I'm not sure there's much to stop them. They got Aaron Rodgers.
Rodgers kind of gets me. Great numbers all the time but only one Super Bowl ring.
That could describe a lot of QBs, I guess.
I guess so but is it him or the team?
Maybe they haven't put a good enough team around him.
I thought you'd say that. Or maybe he's just not the winner he's cracked up to be.
It's not like the heyday with Bret Favre.
That's for sure. And Mike Holmgren as coach.
Yeah, after Holmgren left it kind of left with him.
They should have let him have the general manager job and been coach too, then he would have stayed.
Yeah, I never understood why they didn't.
That west coast offense, he developed a lot of that stuff.
Yeah, but you know then he went to Seattle and I don't think he did so well there.
You're right. I guess you've always got to find the right combination.
Like Landry and Staubach in Dallas.
Yeah, or Belachick and Brady in New England.
