A new Cars movie is coming out?
I heard. It has been a while since the last one.
Yes. My kids are older now but I think they will still want to see it.
Really? I though it was for younger kids?
That may have been the intention, but we seem to enjoy it as a family.
I guess I need to revisit them and take a second look.
The people they chose to do the voices were the best. They really compliment each other. Mater was hilarious.
He was the tow truck, right? He was funny.
Not sure what kid of story line they will go with.
Hope they can pull it off. Sometimes sequels are not the best!
