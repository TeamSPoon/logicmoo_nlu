What do you think about Rhianna's musi?
I don't know her songs but I do like her fashion.
Her fashion? What are you speaking about?
When she appeared at the Metropolitian Museum for a Fashion show she looked amazing!
Her eye makeup took three hours to finish.
And those shoes, she was 5 inches taller!
What about her beat?  Listen to this...
Her words are like some kind of poem.
She is originally from the islands, like Bahama.
She has the beat like a steel drum band.
I like her words.
Rhianna seems to know what I am thinking.
I have every album she has ever done.
I love the colors she wears, especially at the music awards shows.
Did you see her blond wig this week?
Who can miss her?
She lives right next door to Cher on PCH in Malibu.
I know the place, called the Pavilions.  Beautiful scene for a pretty lady.
So are you coming with me to see her on her next appearance locally?
What ever the cost, I have to go!
