what is your favorite Gaga song?
I think Just Dance, It was like an anthem for me for a while.
It does make you want to move.
I like that about her music a lot, so energetic .
I like the telephone song a lot.
That is a great one great video too.
Gaga is such a creative genius.
I feel she has really done well for herself.
Ya  she even dropped out of school to pursue her dreams, I admire her dedication.
Me too. She does work very hard and has the talent to back it all up.
