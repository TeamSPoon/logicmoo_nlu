Have you seen the new Beauty and the Beast movie?
Definitely! Have you?
Of course!
Isn't it a stunning movie?
It is! Remember the ballroom dancing scene?
Belle's dress was so beautiful!
I loved how it was very much still like the original animated film, but a little more modern.
And like every Disney movie, great music!
Oh yeah, have to get the soundtrack!
Same here!
