What do you think of Kino?
I haven't heard of them. Who are they?
They were a Soviet era rock band based in Leningrad.
Like the Soviet Union? I didn't know they had rock.
Yeah, they developed a rock scene in the 80s which the government never really approved of.
So what do you like about this band?
Something about the music just appeals to me. The lead singer's voice has this soulful quality, and some of their songs have an introspective feeling.
Interesting. Are they still active?
Unfortunately no, the lead singer died in a car accident in 1990.
That's too bad. How many albums did they release?
They had seven studio albums.
That's a good amount of productivity. Any songs I should look for that you think are good?
There's one called Zvezda po imeni Solntse, which means The Star Called Sun, I liked that a lot.
Soulful singing and introspective composition?
Yeah, that's a pretty good example of what I was talking about. There's another song called Kukushka, or Cuckoo. It's gotten really famous.
How so?
It's been covered by a number of Eastern Bloc artists, and recently was the theme song for a major movie in Russia.
Interesting.
You should give Kino a chance if you ever find the time and interest.
I definitely will. It will be interesting to see what Soviet era rock was like.
