Did you hear that Disney is adapting Jack and the Beanstalk?
Oh, I loved that story as a kid!
I did too! I think it's a good choice.
Do you know anything else about the movie?
It's going to be called "Gigantic."
Hmm. Sounds like it'll be a lot about the giant.
The giant living in the clouds was always such a weird part of that story to me.
Yeah, it's weird but you have to take stories like that with a grain of salt.
Anyway, it comes out in 2020, so we've got a while to wait.
I'll be excited when it comes out!
