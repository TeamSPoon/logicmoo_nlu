Krampus was so scary
I know, it makes you think of christmas differently
Its wierd how he takes out a whole neighborhood
Yes, and you dont win
Nobody survived, thats strange for a horror movie
I know, usually at least one person survives
It was weird
And definitely scary
I hope they dont come out with another one
I would probably watch it though
