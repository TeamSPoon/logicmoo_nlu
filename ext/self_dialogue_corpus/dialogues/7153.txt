Are you a fan of Disney movies?
Yea I love Disney!
What's your favorite movie that they've released.
Wow, that's an extremely difficult question.
Haha, sorry, I was just curious.
I'd probably have to say Toy Story. Woody and Buzz were awesome lead characters
They were so lovable!
What about you, what was your favorite Disney movie?
Definitely Mighty Ducks. I'm a big sports person so that was my favorite growing up.
Yea that's a good choice too.
