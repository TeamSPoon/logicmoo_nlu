So how "realistic" would you say A New Hope, the first Star Wars movie, is?
Well, it's funny that you bring that up, because when you think of Star Wars as opposed to, like, a 1950s sci-fi movie, it becomes apparent.
You mean that it was revisionist, in the sense of how Westerns started to change?
Yes, I think so, because certain tropes get played around with.
Like Princess Leia as a damsel in distress, or Chewbacca as a big scary creature...
Sure, and what people say a lot is that the Star Wars universe looks "lived-in."
Like an old pair of jeans, you mean?
Yeah, exactly -- characters wear kind of rough, worn-out looking garments, especially on Tattooine, and the ships look kind of broken down.
Whereas in those 1950s movies, there is a kind of postwar optimism in how we see the future...
Sure, everything is shiny and new, but in Star Wars, it's a galaxy that's a lot more like our own sort of drab world.
