Hey, have you heard about the new Mulan live action adaptation?
Yes, I have. I'm really excited about.
Me too. Mulan is one of my favorite movies.
Mine too. I really like it because it has one of the best movie sequels ever made.
Yes, I agree. The music in both movies are amazing.
Yes, I agree. The feminism displayed by Mulan in both movies is also really aspiring.
I know, its the first thing that drew me to those movies.
Yes, it parallels that of Frozen. I live it.
You're right! Ming-Na Wen and Idina Menzel were perfect for their respective roles.
Don't forget Kristin Bell. She was good too.
