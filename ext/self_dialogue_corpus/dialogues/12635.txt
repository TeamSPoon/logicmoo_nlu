What was your favorite Star Wars movie?
I really cant name one specific one I liked the most.
Did you like the prequels?
I mean Natalie Portman was good in them
I think they were a little dull to be honest.
Not me, I appreciated their backstory
I think Lucas over shot his coverage with them
In what respect?
Well they didnt need to develop some of the plotlines
Sure they do the Star Wars universe is huge
