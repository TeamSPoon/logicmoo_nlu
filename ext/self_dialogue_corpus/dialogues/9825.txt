Have you heard the latest Childish Gambino album?
I've only heard a couple of songs from it.
Which ones?
Redbone and Riot.
Redbone is the stand out track on the album, but it's not my favorite.
Which one is your favorite track?
I really like Me and your Mama.
I've seen some websites giving that track really good reviews.
Yeah, it's really easy to get into, and I catch new things in it every time I listen.
I'll have to add it to my playlist.
