Do you know how some bands play the same songs as other bands?
Can you give me an example?
Well the Beatles and Aerosmith are a good example.
Which song are you referring to?
Come together was done by both.
Ok I like Aerosmiths version.
Yes me too, it is more energetic.
The Beatles are great though.
Yes but for that particular song, Aerosmith did it better.
I agree, thank you for mentioning this, I had forgot about this song.
