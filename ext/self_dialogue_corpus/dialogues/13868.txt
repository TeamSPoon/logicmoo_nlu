What Lady Gaga songs do you like?
I like Perfect Illusion.
Is that from the new album.
Yeah it is. I just heard it and I thought it was great.
I will have to check that out.
I also like You and I.
That is old but still good.
What do you think about Marry the Night.
I always thought that was a good song.
Yeah me too, and it is underrated.
