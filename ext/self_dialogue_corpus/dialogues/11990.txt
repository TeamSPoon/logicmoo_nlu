What does Star Wars even mean?
Well, there's lots of stars, and it's kind of a war.
I guess that makes sense.
Yeah and it's a pretty cool name think about it.
STAR WARS. You're right. It sounds cool
And it's nice and symmetrical. A perfect name for something epic.
Yeah, I like how symbolic Star Wars is.
Yeah I feel like Star Wars just focuses on being symbolic. Like their characters.
And their font.  Their opening sequence is just trying to be edgy.
That's an interesting way to think about it.
