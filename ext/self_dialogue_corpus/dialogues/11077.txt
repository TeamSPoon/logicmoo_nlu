1990s fashion is really making a comeback right now.
I know, it's really popular and shows no signs of slowing down.
I'm seeing a lot of neon accents and slip dresses.
Me too, Michelle Williams just recently wore a lace Louis Vuitton slip dress.
Remember Courtney Love used to always wear them with tiaras?
Yes, she really grunged it up.
A bob haircut with bangs is popular again too.
Drew Barrymore had the coolest bob and bangs combo in the 90s.
Taylor Swift has the bob and bangs combo hairstyle now.
I read that track pants are coming back into fashion as well.
Like the ones that Sporty Spice used to wear?
Yes, Rihanna just released similar track pants for her Fenty collection.
I'm definitely not attached to the track pants style.
I could take it or leave it.
I love the cuffed jeans style that is back now though.
Me too, I love a nice fitting pair of boyfriend jeans with a cuff at the bottom.
Yes, with a tank top and button down shirt.
Or a sweater, something that hangs nicely. Nothing too fitted.
That's one of my favorite outfits.
Me too, through on a pair of converse sneakers and you're good to go.
