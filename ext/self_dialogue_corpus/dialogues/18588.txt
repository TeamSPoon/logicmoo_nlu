What do you think of Beyonce?
I do not like her.
Who do you like then?
I am a fan of Taylor Swift.
What songs of hers would you recommend?
I would start with Love Story.
Did she write that one?
She writes most of her songs.
I did not know that.
She writes songs for others too.
Like what?
Better Man, by the country band.
Lady Antebellum?
Yes, that is the one.
She does do a lot of good songs.
I like that she has a wide range.
The county and pop.
I always feel she is a singer songwriter.
Goes across so many genres.
Like a female Bob Dylan.
