Have you seen a scary movie called The Others?
Yes with Nicole Kidman? That was a great movie.
I loved it. Never saw the twist at the end coming.
They did a good job of hiding it. I can understand her reasons though.
Nicole Kidman's characters reasons for what she did?
Well not for murdering the children but for everything she did as a ghost when she thought they were alive.
Oh right. She thought they had a serious photosensitivity to light and she tried to protect him.
Right. It was sad because you could see she loved them, she just went insane.
I can't believe people used to take pictures of their dead sitting up and posed.
That was probably one of the creepiest parts of the movie, those photos of the dead.
