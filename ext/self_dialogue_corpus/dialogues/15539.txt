The oldest extant example of polypony being used in a mass is the Messe de Nostre Dame from 1364. Written by Guillaume de Machaut
That's one weird name.
He's a French
That explains a lot.
Yep. oxford camerata recorded the mass. it's quite beautiful
Let me go find it on youtube.
Listen to all the harmony. But this was 14th century, and they had centuries of development of music theory by then
Yeah. I see that.
The earliest polyphonic example to date was discovered in the UK. it was written around 900 AD.
They have a performance of it on youtube
Yep, it wasn't very good though.
Yeah it kinda sucked.
Compare, though, gregorian chants that are monophonic
Yes? What about?
Some just sound better even without harmonies.
oh, I see what you mean.
All these polyphonic traditions from medieval Europe led to the emergence of the most dominant music in the history of mankind
The Western art music isn't the most dominant.
No. it's not but it IS the most difficult, and that tradition in discipline and theories led to the emergence of the American popular music which IS the most dominant musical form in the history of mankind
I see your point
