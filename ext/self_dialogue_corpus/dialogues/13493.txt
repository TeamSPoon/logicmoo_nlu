Have you seen all the Star Wars movies?
All but the latest one.
I haven't seen that one either, I was going to ask if you thought it was good.
I heard it was really good and I want to see it.
Do you want to watch Star Wars The Force Awakens together?
Yes, I would like that.
What do you think it's about?
I'm not sure I heard it's quite a few years in the future after Luke and Vader.
I wonder if any notable characters will be in it?
I'm sure some will be.
