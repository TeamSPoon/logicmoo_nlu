I really want to visit Disney World.
But haven't you been to Disneyland a lot? What's so different?
Disneyworld has a Lilo and Stich rides.
That's one of my favorite movies!
Mine as well. It never fails to cheer me up and make me cry.
It's an emotional rollercoaster!
But well worth the ride.
I agree. The message of ohana really resonates with me.
Yeah, that's the part that makes me cry--it's so meaningful.
Isn't it? I love the family relationships in that movie.
