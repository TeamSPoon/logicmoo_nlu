Hey, did you see the latest one, Fate of the Furious?
Yeah, I hated Charlize Theron's character.
What about Dom, did you really think he went bad again?
No, not for a minute. I was like, he doesn't have a choice!
I don't get what Dom trusted Jason Statham's character with that though.
Yeah, didn't he kill Dom's Asian friend?
That scene in Cuba was awesome, man. When the car was about to explode?
Yeah, there was flame coming through the window and Dom was just like, "Almost there!" Haha.
The submarine! Tyrese Gibson knocking that guy out with the car door!
Yeah, for once he's not just the comedic relief. He was like, "How am I number 11 on the top ten most wanted list?"
