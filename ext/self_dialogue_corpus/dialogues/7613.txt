I re-watched all of the Harry Potter movies last week.
Awesome! Which one is your favorite?
I love them all, but if I had to pick one, I guess Goblet of Fire.
I like that one too, but I always cry when Cedric dies.
Me too! He is such a good character. I think the Tri Wizard tournament is fun to watch though.
Yeah, it is. I think my favorite movie is the first Deathly Hallows.
That is a good one. I'm glad it was spit up into two movies so the whole story could be covered.
Agreed! I like both of them for sure. Of course I knew Snape dies, but it is still always sad to see.
Why do so many characters we love have to die?!
I know! I get so emotional!
