Hey, who do you think will make the NFL Superbowl 2018?
I actually believe it will be the Seahawks and Panthers.
So, you think the Patriots won by chance last year?
No.The Patriots did not play a great team in the Superbowl.
You don't believe The Falcons was a great team?
The Falcons was a good team but not great, they always die in the second half of a game.
Are you a Seahawks fan?
Not really, I like there Quarter back Russell Wilson.
Do you think Russell Wilson is a better quarterback than Cam Newton?
They are both great players but Russell Wilson has a slight edge over Cam.
Speaking of quarterbacks what is your opinion of Matt Ryan?
Matt Ryan is improving his game every year, if he stays on that track he will be the next great quarterback of all time.
Okay. How would you rate The Redskins quarterback Cousins?
Cousins is good but he needs more help from his teammates.
Now that the the Redskins just added Doug Williams as Vice President of personnel do you believe he can acquire better players to help Cousins?
Actually we will have to wait and see if he does.
Do you agree with the new contract amount for Kirk Cousins?
It is a large amount he needs to totally improve his game.
Should the Redskins change their team name?
I am just curious as to way it has taken this long for people to acknowledge it's an offence word for many.
