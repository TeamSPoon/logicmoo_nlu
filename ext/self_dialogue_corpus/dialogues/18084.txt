AC/DC is probably my favorite.

Yes that is a good song, I like you shook me all night long.
I like that song too. Do you like Aerosmith?
Yes, they are a classic group.
I agree Steven Tyler has a great voice.
Do you often listen to rock music?
No, I usually listen to country, but I do like some rock.
Do you like Tom Petty?
I do, I really like their song free fallin'.
Yes, and Mary Jane's Last Dance is a good one too.
Do you like Disturbed at all?
No, their music is to hard for me to listen to.
A lot of people say that.
I only like the bands that I can clearly hear what they are saying.
I agree with that.
Would you like to listen to AC/DC?
Sure, do you have an album?
I do. I will turn it on.
