Have you seen the movie The Circle?
No, I haven't heard of it. Who's in it?
Emma Watson and Tom Hanks.
Wow that sounds like a good cast. What is it about?
It's about social media companies breaking privacy boundaries.
Sounds really relevant. What did you think?
Unfortunately, it wasn't that good.
Why not?
It was just kind of disappointing.
How so?
It had the opportunity to be so good because it's a unique concept but it really fell flat.
I'm surprised that it's bad with those actors in it.
I know I figured it would be good because of Watson and Hanks, but it was just filled with unfulfilled potential.
Was it supposed to be a joke?
No, it was supposed to be a serious drama, but I feel like it would have been more successful as a comedy.
Well, I guess it just proves even great actors can be in bad movies.
Yes it does. I wouldn't go see it.
Yeah I probably won't. I don't want to waste my money.
It would definitely be a waste.
Thanks for the heads up.
