Why are there so many Saw movies.
People love the franchise and a good horror flick.
I think the movies are terribly acted.
They have many gaps in terms of how the movie played out.
I think you could say that this is the end for it.
People love the idea of it.
I think that you could say it is one of the better horror franchises.
The idea about sawing yourself to get out is bizarre.
That is the conundrum the writers wanted.
I would rather have a slasher film with a saw.
