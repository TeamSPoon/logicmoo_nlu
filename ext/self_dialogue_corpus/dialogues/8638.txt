What style of rock music is your favorite?
That's a tough question. There I days when I most want to listen to 90s alternative rock and days when I prefer softer, more current rock.
I can understand that. Different days you have different moods and might want to listen to something different.
Exactly. Lately I have been listening to a good amount of Goo Goo Dolls.
Oh, really? They are one of my favorites. I listened to their album Dizzy Up the Girl so many times through.
That's a good album. Do you also like Counting Crows?
Absolutely. Mr. Jones is a song I grew up with.
Me too. My parents let me pick the music that I listened to so I heard a lot of Goo Goo Dolls, Matchbox 20, Counting Crows and that style growing up.
Oh, I saw Matchbox 20 last year in concert. They played several songs from the album Yourself or Something Like You.
Awesome, I'm sure that was a great show.
