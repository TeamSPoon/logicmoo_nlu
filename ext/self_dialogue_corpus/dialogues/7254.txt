Have you seen any of Disney's classic movies from before they started making computer animated features?
Yes I have. They were some of my fondest childhood memories!
Really? What where some of your favorites?
I really liked the older classics like Snow White and Cinderella. But my favorite of all time would have to be Aladdin.
Why is Aladdin your favorite Disney movie?
Because Robin Williams as the Genie was the most amazing thing ever!
Oh yes, his performance certainly stole the show.
There's that, and I also loved the little monkey in the movie.
Do you mean Apu?
Yes, that's the one!
