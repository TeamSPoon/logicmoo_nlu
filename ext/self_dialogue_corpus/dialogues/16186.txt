What is your favorite style of music?
I really like indie rock and hip hop. What about you?
I like a little bit of everything actually. I like to keep things diverse.
That's not something you usually hear a lot, most people are pretty set in their music ways.
I moved around a lot growing up, so I was exposed to a lot of different music.
Do you like Fences?
I do actually, I saw them live a few times. Do you like them?
Yes, they are one of my favorites. Do you have a favorite band?
I have a few, I like Tool, The Misfits, and A Perfect  Circle.
Would you say you lean more towards rock then?
No, I don't think so. I was just listening to Frank Ocean on my over here.
I haven't heard of him, is he good?
He's really good, he's a rapper from Long Beach.
I don't listen to a lot of rap. I just never really got into it.
You should give it a chance, you never know, you might like it.
You sound like my mom trying to get me to eat vegetables when I was a kid.
Well, you eat vegetables now, don't you?
Ok, you got me there.
How about I make you a mix tape? Then you can see what I'm talking about, just keep an open mind.
Ok, thanks I'll take you up on that!
