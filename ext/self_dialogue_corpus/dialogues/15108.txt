What is a funny movie we can watch?
How about Harold and Kumar Go To White Castle?
I love that movie. Kal Penn is so funny.
Neil Patrick Harris really made it for me.
Oh I know. That was so unexpected.
Did you see the sequel to Harold and Kumar Go To White Castle?
Escape from Guantanamo Bay?
Yes. What did you think?
Not a fan. It felt forced.
I agree, definitely not as funny as the original.
