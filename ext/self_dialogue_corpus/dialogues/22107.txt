What is the scariest horror movie of all time?
It's got to be The Exorcist. I still don't want to watch that alone.
I need a young priest and an old priest!
The power of Christ compels you! The power of Christ compels you!
When I saw Seth McFarland yelling that in This Is The End, I laughed so hard I thought I was going to die.
That is an awesome movie. It's hilarious. I don't know why it doesn't get more respect.
I can give you two good reasons it doesn't get much respect.
What?
First, they show giant Satan, and giant Satan's penis.
Yeah, that was not a pretty scene.
Not a great moment for the history of cinema.
So what's the other reason?
James Franco.
Okay, that's true: nobody seems to like James Franco.
Those are the two indisputable reasons why nobody thinks This Is The End is a great movie.
No, there's one thing that should cancel any criticism out.
What?
Three words: Back Street's Back!
You have got to be kidding.
Yo  know you love that song.
