When did you first see a Star Wars film?
I saw it in the theater back in the Summer of 1977.
Wow, I didn't think you looked that old.  What did you think of it?
I thought it was a cool movie that got right down to business. It starts with a battle scene, unlike other movies that seem to take forever to get going.
So the first movie is still your favorite?
I'd say so, but I remember that I'd learned in kindergarten a few months before that if you put an s after a word it makes it plural, and there was only one war in that movie.
I guess George Lucas sort of fixed that as he went along.
I guess so, but I think it was a big mistake to make Luke Darth Vader's son.
But that's essential to the entire series.  Why do you think that?
In the first movie Luke and Han were everyman heroes.  Making Luke Vader's son turns him into a chosen-one superhero who comes by his by by his genetics.
