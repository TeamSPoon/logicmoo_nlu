Yeah I love baseball.
Who do you like?
I'm a White Sox fan.
Oh I see, Chicago huh.
Yeah that's where I grew up.
Must have been tough with the Cubbies winning the world series last year.
Yeah it was rough, but it was cool for the city.
I see what you mean.
It was also good for baseball.
That was the first series I've watched in a long time.
Yeah exactly.
I'm a Marlins fan myself.
Oh okay.
