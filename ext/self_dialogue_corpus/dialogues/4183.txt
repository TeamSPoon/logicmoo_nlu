What is your favorite type thriller type of movie?
I love the Taken series.
Oh my gosh, me too. I was on the edge of my seat during the entire first movie.
Liam Neeson plays the role so well. He is so believable.
Ya. He is one of my favorite actors.
I love how you don't know what is going to happen during the movie and it just takes one turn after the other.
Ya I couldn't stop watching. A movie has not kept me that interested for a long time.
It was also pretty emotional once he saved her.
I know. I felt horrible for what happened to her best friend though.
Ya it is terrible and quite a lesson.
