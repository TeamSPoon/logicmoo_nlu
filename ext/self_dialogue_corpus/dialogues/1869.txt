How are the Bears gonna be this year?
Terrible.
You think?
They're a terrible team and have been for a long time.
You don't have faith in Trubisky?
I don't have faith in the organization.
Why not?
For one, they can't retain talent. Marshall, Forte, Jeffrey, all gone.
Cutler too.
Cutler wasn't great but face it, he's the best QB they've ever had.
Better than McMahon?
Way better. That team got by on its defense.
All Bears teams have.
And this Bears team has a terrible defense as well!
They're pretty sad.
What's even sadder is how they think they're this legendary franchise because they won once.
They're an old team, though.
Yeah, with a long history of futility.
They have the Ditka sketch though.
And that's about it.
