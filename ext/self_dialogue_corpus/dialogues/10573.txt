Hi. Haven't talked to you in a while.
Hello. Yes it's been a bit.
How have you been?
Great. I just saw the best movie.
What was it?
I went to see Guardians of the Galaxy 2.
I heard that the music in that was wonderful.
It was. Like the first movie they used classic rock from the '70's and '80's.
What else can you tell me about it without giving away the plot?
Well, I wouldn't worry too much. The plot is the least impressive part.
You didn't like the plot?
It was just a little too simple. Everything was predictable.
What did you like about besides the music?
There is a lot to like. I especially like visual effects.
Did they bring back Michael Rooker's character from the first movie?
They did. His character's name is Yando and he had a large role.
He was my favorite from the first movie.
He great in the sequel. Michael Rooker is one of my favorite actors.
How was everything else?
On the whole the movie was great. Worth seeing in a theater.
