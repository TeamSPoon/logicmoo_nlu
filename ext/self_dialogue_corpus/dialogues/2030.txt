So the first kickoff game of the season is September 7th.
I know I'm just too excited to control myself.
My team plays Sunday against your team!
Hopefully my Packers have stepped their game up and got themselves together.
Just so you know SeaHawks are going to demolish your pretty little Packers.
So who plays the kick off game?
I think the Chiefs vs the Patriots.
That should be a good game.
Yes it should and that's why we should go to the bar to watch it.
Drinks and Football is my type of party.
So do you think you're going to buy tickets this year to see the Packers at Lambeau Field??
Yes of course I am, I'm buying tickets for the game on the 31st and I'm taking my granny for her birthday!
That's the Rams vs the Packers that night right?
Yes it is and that is sure to be one heck of a game.
I know, I should go with you.
Yes you should the tickets are only around 52 bucks per person.
I sure will think about it because there's nothing I love more then watching the Packers lose.
I guess you're not going to have fun because the Packers will be crushing teams all season!
You wish!
No I know.
