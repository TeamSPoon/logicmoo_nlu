Hey man you like the new movie that came out
Which one
The one that is  the start of the new trilogy
It was pretty decent to be frank
Not wow omg amazing to you?
Nah the new characters did not do to much for me
I mean they could have been a bit more oomph to them
Yeah they kinda needed some more development
I feel they were as  one would say half baked
Exactly!
