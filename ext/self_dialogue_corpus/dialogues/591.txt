Would you be surprised if the Philadelphia Eagles won the Superbowl next year?
I think everyone would be surprised if that happened.
It's not completely impossible for them to win it.
John Kennedy was about to get inaugurated the last time they won a Superbowl!
Wow that is longer then I thought.
They need a rebuild if they are looking to win a Superbowl.
Would you keep any of the current players on the roster in a rebuild?
It is to early to tell if Carson Wentz is a player to rebuild around.
Yeah he had 16 touchdowns but 14 interceptions last season.
1 to 1 is not a great ratio.
You are right though he could get better this season.
The front office must be praying that he does.
Would you bet any money on the Eagles winning the Superbowl right now?
Only if the odds were ridiculous to the point that betting ten dollars would make me rich.
I am sure the odds are pretty great already.
Hey maybe it would be worth it then.
Yeah I mean you either lose ten bucks or gain hundreds maybe thousands.
I will think about it.
We better watch the start of the Eagles season closely.
I am with you on that.
