do you know afi
yes, i love them
which album do you like?
i like decemberunderground
the white album huh? i like sing the sorrow
those two albums are amazing
they had the black album followed by their white album
well, nobody calls it that though
yeah, but im speaking of the covers.
its kinda interesting though.
i wonder if it was premeditated.
probably so. ill look it up
sing the sorrow was so epic though
his screams were so intense in that album
he had to get surgery afterwards
really? so in decemberunderground he already got the surgery?
yeah, i guess his screams were hurting his vocal cords
its hard to sing and take care of your body
it definitely is
its not easy being a singer
