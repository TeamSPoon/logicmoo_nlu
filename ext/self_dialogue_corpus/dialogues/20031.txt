Have you heard of Porcupine Tree?
What on earth... No I haven't. Care to explain?
Yeah they have a weird name.
That's for sure.
Anyways, they're a really interesting band I found.
What do they sound like?
They really have their own sound, but they're kind of like Pink Floyd.
Oh I like Pink Floyd. Are they exactly like them?
Well there's a lot of heavy stuff, like progressive metal and rock.
That's interesting.
Some songs have piano and really ambient sounds too though.
Whoa, that's wild.
Yeah some of their songs are like 18 minutes long and go through all these different phases.
That's really cool, what are the songs about?
Most of them are about depression and drugs, kind of dark stuff.
Nice, that's very interesting.
Their name is a joke by the way, they started off as a joke.
How did that work?
They didn't plan on becoming a real band until they found out people really liked their music.
That's really funny. I'll look them up later on Youtube then.
