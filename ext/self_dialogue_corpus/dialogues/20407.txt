I'm beginning to think that movies with both Tina Fey and Amy Poehler are the best for group watching.
What makes you say that?
Well, first off, the writing is always great.
Tina Fey probably wouldn't be part of them if it wasn't.
Right, and they're geared towards audience participation. So everyone's always laughing and talking.
So, like, you want people to participate when you have a movie night.
Exactly. I want everyone to have fun.
We did have fun last time with Mean Girls.
What do you think we should try next week?
What are the choices?
I want to do another movie with both of them. So either Baby Mama or Sisters.
Of those I'd prefer Baby Mama, I didn't really like Sisters.
Maybe this is a mistake then. Are there any other movies you think might be good?
Well, speaking of Tina Fey, I thought she was great in This is Where I Leave You.
I've never heard of it.
It's a movie about a funeral, but it's also very funny. Jason Bateman is in it.
That could be interesting then! I love Jason Bateman.
It's a good role for him, too.
Well, we can try that if you want.
Great! I'll bring a copy.
