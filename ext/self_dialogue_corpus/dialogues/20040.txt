I'm a big Jane Fonda fan, I can't wait to watch Klute.
I've never seen Klute is it a new film?
No, Klute came out in the seventies when Jane Fonda was making a lot of movies.
I think I've heard of that film, does she play a waitress?
I'm not sure, but I think she plays a secretary who witnesses a murder.
That was a popular theme in movies from the seventies.
What was the last good horror movie you watched?
I really enjoyed It Follows, I can't stop thinking about it.
I saw the trailer for It Follows, it looked really good.
Don't Breathe looks to be a really frightening movie as well.
I don't think I've seen the trailer, what is Don't Breathe about?
Some young people decide to rob a blind man, but it turns out he's a serial killer.
That sounds amazing, I'm really into movies like that.
The plot from Klute reminds me of Dressed to Kill, the DePalma film from the eighties.
I loved Dressed to Kill, and I can see what you mean about the plot similarity.
Being in the wrong place at the wrong time is a popular cinematic plot device.
I think movies from the seventies have a quality that I really appreciate.
Me too, I think it may have something to do with the film stock that was used back then, they have a distinct look.
Don't get me started on DePalma, Scorsese and the rest of those directors, I could talk forever!
Now those were some of the best when it came to making great movies!
