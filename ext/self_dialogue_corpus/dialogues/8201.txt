You know the 2 most popular albums from Avril Lavigne?
umm, if I guess right, it's gotta be The Best Damn Thing and Let Go?
you know what, you are absolutely right! I see you are a fan of her.
definitely, I loved her music and I still do
when do you come to know her?
well, I remember vividly that I was actually attracted by her album cover art at first, then I started listen to her music and found it great
yeah, when I was in middle school, songs like Girlfriend and Innocence were so popular, they are like something eternal, you never get bored of them
I feel the same. Do you know when Girlfriend first come out, it has broken many billboard records, Avril even made different language version of it
haha, she's very talented alright?
no doubt, but I like the English version the best
