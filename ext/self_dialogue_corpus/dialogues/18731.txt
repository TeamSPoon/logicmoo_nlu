What is your favorite instrument?
Well, I love guitar, but the sweet sound of the mandolin is great.
Ohh, I love the mandolin as well.
The rhythmic twang just gets me going.
It's interesting how it has such fewer frets when compared to a guitar.
Yes, but a lot of damage can be done in that range.
It's similar to the range of a violin.
The violin is the most emotional instrument, I'd say.
The sweet tugs of the bow can pull on my heart strings.
The cello is also sonically intriguing.
Agreed and it's also a deeper instrument.
Have you ever heard of Yo-Yo Ma?
I have not.  What's up with him?
He is a cello prodigy with a special twist.
That doesn't seem overly exciting.
On the contrary, it actually is captivating.
Well, what does he do?
He applies his classically trained virtuosity to modern songs.
Really? That's cool.
From hip hop to heavy metal, Yo-Yo Ma is incredible.
