Do you watch the Fox pregame show?
Yep, I love it, Terri and Howie crack me up.
Wasn't Terry a quarter back for the Steelers
That he was, and Howie was a defensive end for the Oakland Raiders.
What about the rest of the cast, who did they used to play for?
Let's see, Michael Strahan, defensive lineman for new york giants
Oh, that's right, it is really hard to remember who everyone played for
sure is, I now Jimmy Johnson was  coach for Cowboys
What kind of coach
Sorry, he was head coach for Cowboys from 1989 - 1993 and then went to Dolphins as head coach from 1996 - 1999
Oh, I didn't know he went to Dolphins
Yup he sure was.
So what did he do between 1993 and 1996?
I really don't know
So what about Curt Menefee, what team did he play for?
I don't believe he played for any team, I think he is just a sports broadcaster.
OH okay, So I heard Brett Favre wants to come back in some way to the Packers. Obviously he is too old to play.
Yeah, I heard that, maybe as a quarterback coach? I wonder if he would be any good.
Yeah just because you were a good quarterback, doesn't mean you would be a good coach.
You got that right.
