How about the NFL East?
Ah! The best division in football!
Says you! In the 90's yeah, but not now my friend. Dak and Zeke in Dallas. What do you think they'll do this year?
Sophomore slump.
What!?! Your crazy man Dallas is going to repeat as East Champs!
I can't see it. You seen their schedule?  8-8
Whatever  man. Who you got in Second?
It's hard. I'm going to say NY Giants.
They are always hard for me to pick. They can go 7-9 or 13-3, and I never know what they will do!
Eli should be Eli again 30 td and 20 INT. But that's good enough for second and a playoff spot.
Then the Redskins ?
Yeah. Cousin has to prove he deserves that money.
I like him. I really do. I just aint convinced he's a leader.
Yeah, he tries.  But im saying they'll play 500 ball
And that's putting Philly in last.
I Like Carson Wentz, and there Coach too. I forget his name. Used to be Farves back up
Yeah, I know who youre talking about. They will be ready in 2018, but not yet.
All the division games in the East will be tight!
No doubt! Always are!
Yep, my final predictions are Dallas, NY, WSH, and Philly last.but all of them over 500. They are all going to be competitive this year!
