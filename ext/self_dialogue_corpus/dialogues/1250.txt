What do you think about the Raiders this year?
I really like their team, they're young and hungry.
I love David Carr, he's a great leader.
I agree with you on Carr, he's got a bright future.
I also love their offensive line.
It's probably the best line in football.
I'm not totally sold on Lynch coming back though. It's tough for a guy to sit out a year and come back.
In his prime he was a fun running back to watch.
I agree, don't you think he's over the hill?
He might be older; however, he's running behind the best line in the league.  He'll have a good year.
What is your prediction for stats for Lynch?
I would say 1,000 yards rushing and 15 touchdowns.
15 touchdowns? I think you're way over - I'm thinking 8 max.
He'll get at least 15, David Carr even said if they're on the 1 yard line he's giving it to Lynch.
It's too bad they are moving to Vegas.  Oakland is one of the toughest places to play.
Yeah, I don't like the move at all.
I bet in 5-years the NFL looks at expansion and Oakland will be on the list.
Yeah, and they'll build a new stadium for them.
Too bad, they won't be called the Raiders though.
Yeah, surprised Oakland didn't fight to keep the Raider name like Cleveland did when the Browns moved.
