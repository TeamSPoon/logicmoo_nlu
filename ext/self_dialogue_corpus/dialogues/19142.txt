Have you heard Hamilton? I'm obsessed.
Heard it! I've memorized it.
Even Act 2? Act 2 is so tragic!
It is, but I memorized it all. I can't sing Burn without bursting into tears.
The one that gets me is One Last Time. Christopher Jackson's George Washington was so comforting and noble.
He was brilliant, but what about Daveed Diggs?
Oh you mean Mr. Jefferson? I love him!
Me too! I loved him as Lafayette and as Thomas Jefferson.
He could honestly do a one man Hamilton and I would watch ever second.
I don't know, those Schuyler sisters are fierce! Angelica is my favourite.
I like Eliza. The way Lin wrote the songs Helpless and Satisfied to show two different perspectives on the same moment was genius.
Literally, genius.
You know who I really loved though? John Laurens.
Yes, Laurens! Never straying from his dedication to free the slaves.
He was so brave to fight for that cause when so many people around him were against it.
When he sings, "But we'll never be truly free, until those in bondage have the same rights as you and me."
That was so beautiful. And so true.
I can't stop singing it. I'm getting weird looks in public.
In public?
Yeah, the other day I broke into a full song and dance with Wait for It in the bread aisle at the grocery store.
