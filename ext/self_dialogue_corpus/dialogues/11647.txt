What is your favorite oldies song by the Beatles?
They are legends! My favorite will have to be 'Hey Jude.'
That is one of their most popular songs for sure. It has such nice ballads.
I agree. What is your favorite?
I have so much, but if I have to pick a favorite, 'Don't Let Me Down' hands down.
That song takes me back to the old days.  How about 'Here Comes The Sun'?
I know I can't believe how much time has passed.  Of course, that song is so beautiful.
It was played at a wedding I attended recently.
Really? It that song is classic. I want to buy a record now.
Me too, let's checkout a nearby vintage shop and see if we can snag some old Beatles albums.
