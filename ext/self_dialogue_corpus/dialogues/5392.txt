Are the Pixar movies part of Disney?
I think so.  My favorite is "A Bug's Life".
That one is hysterical.  I love Flik.
There's so many jokes that you have to watch it more than once to appreciate it.
I know.  And the fake outtakes at the end are the best!
There's so many famous people doing the voices, too.
I know.  Kevin Spacey is Hopper for example.
And John Ratzenberger is in it of course.
What part does he play?
P.T. Flea who drives that circus wagon.
