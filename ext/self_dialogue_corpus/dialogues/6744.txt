Whats your favorite Disney movie of all time?
Probably Flubber.
Wow, I was not expecting that.
Yea most people don't, but Robin Williams is amazing.
I agree, he was really good as the genie in Aladdin as well.
Yes he was! Does he do any role bad?
I can't think of any.
He's just so funny and owns whatever role he takes.
Yea, Disney did good by hiring him a few times.
Has he done any other Disney movies?
