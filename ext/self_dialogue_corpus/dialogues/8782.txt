It is. What's your favorite Nirvana song?
It's hard to pick a favorite but probably Lithium.
Thats one of my favorites too. My all time favorite is Smells Like Teen Spirit.
I was lucky enough to see them in concert. Pretty awesome.
Lucky you.
I have the very first album ever released, Bleach.
Cool. When was it released?
Late 80's. You know they were inducted into the rock n roll hall of fame?
I didn't know that. What year?
2014
