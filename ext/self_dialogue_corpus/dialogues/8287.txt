Justin Bieber is my favorite pop artist.
Seriously? Not a lot of people like him.
I know, but I really like his music.
Yeah, musically he is very talented.
I love his older songs the best.
Oh, what's your favorite one?
I think it would have to be Baby.
I think that song is what rose him to fame.
Yeah, you're right. What is your favorite song by him?
I like his newer song Sorry.
