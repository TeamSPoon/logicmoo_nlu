Do you like Aaron Rodgers?
He is talented and entertaining to watch.
His Superbowl win in 2011 was incredible.
That was a great year for the Packers.
How many more years do you think he will play?
That is hard to answer.
Try and make your best guess.
Ideally he must want at least 5 more seasons.
If he gets seven or more that would be impressive.
He will need good protection from his linemen when he gets older.
It all comes down to that.
Right because it is easier to get injured once you are older.
I am sure the linemen will realize that and try their best.
They won't want him to get hurt.
Beyond injury it all depends on if Rodgers continues to perform well.
He improved a lot from 2015 to 2016.
How did his stats improve in 2016?
He had nine more touchdowns then 2015 and only one more interception.
I am sure the nine extra touchdowns made the one extra interception worth it for him.
It definitely did make it not as bad!
