Did you know Aladdin is a musical stage play coming to town soon?
Yes, I saw the ad for it on TV last night.
I want to see it.
I'd miss Robin Williams as the Genie.
Yes, but I'm sure whomever they cast as the Genie will be good.
No doubt, but I'll be comparing him to Robin Williams. He's who I know as the Genie.
I suppose so.
I get nostalgic when it comes to Disney.
Me, too I guess.
But I still want to see the musical!
