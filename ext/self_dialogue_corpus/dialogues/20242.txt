Has Simon Pegg done any new movies lately?
I think he was just in Mission Impossible 6.
I didn't know that.
Yeah, we haven't caught up on all the Mission Impossible movies.
Me either.
He was in another Mission Impossible too, a few years ago.
We usally like to watch his comedies.
Me too. He's funny.
Of course our favorite is Shaun of The Dead.
Mine too.
Those characters could've probably been able to get away with a part two.
I know I would've watched it.
Did you ever watch the movie Paul, with him in it?
No, I didn't see it.
That's a must see.
I'll have to see if it's on Netflix.
If not, get the DVD, it's also funny.
I will. I love his movies.
I'd take comedy over action with him.
Me too.
