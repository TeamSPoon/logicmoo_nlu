what do you think of joanne by gaga?
MUCH better than artpop.
I was so disappointed by artpop.
I expected a lot more from gaga.
It seemed rushed and dramatic for no reason.
Dope was the only great song from it.
she brought that song to the highest emotional intensity.
it was sparse and beautiful. it was her and a piano.
joanne brought it back to the simplicity and catchiness.
it sure did
