What do you think of the cold shoulder trend?
I love it! It is so summery and feminine
Yes, I especially love dresses and pretty blouses in that style.
I saw so many floral cold shoulder dresses on sale that day.
Did you buy anything?
Yes, I bought a floral long dress with cold shoulder from Zara.
It sounds lovely. Was it on sale?
Yes it was on sale.
Did you buy any accessories to go with it?
Yes, I bought a strappy sandal and a chunky necklace.
I think chunky necklaces or long dangly earrings will go so well with that style.
Yes, I agree.
I saw a pretty denim off shoulder blouse that day.
Did you buy it?
No, it was rather expensive.
You should check out Target. I saw some off shoulder blouses there too.
I will go have a look later. I will also look out for skinny jeans.
Skinny jeans and off shoulder go very well.
I think it is chic look.
Definately. I love that look.
