My daughter got me listening to a new band.
Really, who?
The 1975.
That's the name, never heard of them.
They've actually been around since 2002.
What kind of music do they play?
They are considered Rock.
Any good songs?
Yes. They remind me of INXS.
I used to like them.
Me too.
Any songs played on the radio?
Not sure but the song called AntiChrist is good.
I'll have to find them on YouTube.
Yes, look them up.
Are they American?
No from England.
A lot of good bands are.
Yeah, but you will enjoy their type of music.
Can't wait to listen.
