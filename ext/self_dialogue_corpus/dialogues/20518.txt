Ever seen the Secret Life of Pets?
Disney movie, right?
I think a Pixar movie, but yes.
The movie that has the animals that live in the city and what they do when the owners are gone for the day?
Yes! Like when the animals turn on the stereo and all rock out, that was so cute!
The little gangster bunny, I believe Kevin Hart does his voice, that bunny is too much!
I thought it was so cute, he had all his cronies living in the sewer.
All the different animals, yes I remember that, and the dog that had the steel muzzle.
That part reminds me of The Silence of The Lambs!
I think that was what they were aiming for with that dog.
It does make you wonder what the pets do when owners are gone!
That movie is a top favorite for a lot of children, they watch it over and over.
I am an adult and could watch it over and over!
I like movies that have animals playing parts, or is about animals.
Me too, those seem to be my favorite types of movies really!
Mine as well, I do not know who did the voices of those animals in the movies though.
I know Kevin Hart was one, a few others sound so familiar but I would have to look it up.
I think one of the voices in the movie was also in Finding Nemo.
I thought that too when I first saw it.
Finding Nemo is another great flick, one of my absolute favorites.
