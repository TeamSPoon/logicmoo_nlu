Who was the best NFL coach of all time?
I would have to say John Madden.
How come?
He has the highest winning percentage for a regular season.
Not many probably know that.
Yes, he's more famous as an announcer I think.
He also has a Super Bowl Ring.
Not many can say that.
Wouldn't that be awesome to have one of them.
Yeah, I heard someone auctioned off their ring for $200,000.
Wow, that's like winning the lottery.
They carry a lot of value.
It would be rare to have one.
It takes incredible perseverance and hard work to get that far.
Strength as well.
I've never seen a weak football player.
That's for sure.
What do you think the NFL players bench?
Whatever it is would be a lot more than I could ever do or imagine.
They are amazing people.
