Are the Chiefs going go to repeat as AfC West Champs?
Heck yeah, the only competition for them is the Raiders.
What's  Jeremey Machlin going to do in Baltimore
I dont know. He'll be good, but he won't put up Steve Smith numbers.
I wonder how long it will be before Mahonnes replaces Alex Smith.
I know! I'd love to see Smith ball out knowing this year is it for him.
For real! I think we can make it to the Superbowl!
Just get it to Tyreek Hill and he's gone!
I love that bad man!!! I ain't worried about them Raiders either. We own them.
Indeed! Did you see how much they paid Carr?!?!
They ain't changed. Man do a little bit, they pay him a lot.
Marshawn Lynch worries me a little bit, but they ain't smart enough to feed him once we get the lead.
We play them in prime time right?
You know it. And we got Dallas in week 11 I think.
Thats right! That's going to be the first Cowboys game that Romo calls!
I wonder who he'll be pulling for!
Hahaha! You know us! KC!!!
I was scared of the rumors of him coming to us!
Me too. I'm glad he didnt. I'm glad he didn't go to Denver either!
He's in the best place for himself. I'm anxious to hear him call some games.
