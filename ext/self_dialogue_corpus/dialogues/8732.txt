You like John Lennon solo music?
I love it.
When double fantasy came out in 1980 I was so excited.
It was a long time coming for him.
Yea,he,went away and,disappeared in the seventies pretty much.
Too bad the idiot had to kill him.
He had a lot more to contribute.
Yes he did.
Double fantasy went to number one,didn't it?
Yes it did. Shot up the charts!
