Which of the Spiderman movies did you like?
I liked the first Spiderman movie when Tobey Mcguire played Spiderman.
What did you think of the newer Spiderman.
Andrew Garfield I just did not like in the role as much as Tobey.
Yes, the second movie with Garfield was especially weak.
Tobey McGuire played a just more genuine Spiderman.
Yes, I liked the plot better in the first movie as well.
Even though the Gwen character more closely followed the comic?
I heard Gwen was Spidey's original love interest in the comics.
That is a fact.
