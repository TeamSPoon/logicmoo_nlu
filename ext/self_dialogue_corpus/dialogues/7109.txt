The movie UP made me cry !
same here, it was really sad how the old man was living alone
I wish a house would really float with balloons
so do I , that would be so much fun!
That little boy was also really cute, I liked how the movie ended
I know but like you said it was sad
The old man was so lonely and the boy really helped him
he did, everyone needs someone like that in their life
I know , older people can get so lonely at times
They can, that boy was a bright spot in the mans life, he missed his wife so much
