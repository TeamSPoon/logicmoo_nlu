Do you think Taylor Swift is country or rock?
Neither. I think she's pop.
Yeah, but what type of pop.
So, you're pressing me to define her specific contribution to the music scene?
Yes, I am.
Well, she stared in country. Over the years, however, I'd say she became rock.
Yes, that fits.
What do you mean?
Well, her main influences are Shaina Twain and Stevie Nicks.
Yes, one from country and one from rock.
Yes, so it all makes sense.
It's strange, though.
How so? What is strange about Taylor's role in the global music industry?
It's just interesting to see someone start one place and end up another.
Yes, but it seems like it happens to everyone who makes it in the music industry.
Can you give me another example?
Sure, let's look at Nine Inch Nails.
What's their genre?
Well, they started in the underground music scene -- especially the Industrial genre. But, in the end, they won a Grammy in metal.
Wow, I love music and the stories associated with it!
