have you heard of 1975
the british band?
yup, they released that long sophomore titled album.
the one about being asleep or something.
yes, thats the one.
the album was pretty good.
i liked their debut album better
yeah, it had sex and chocolate.
the beginning of chocolate is so good
it has that kinda funky and upbeat intro.
its a great song to drive to
i'll try that next time
they seem very sure of themselves
the singer has a unique voice and he says some interesting stuff
he kinda makes fun of the industry and stuff
he does that a lot.
just taking the piss out of music and stuff
its kinda cool.
i wonder when they'll have a new album
me too
