The best part of those Rocky movies was the music!
Oh, yeah?
Yeah! First, you got the theme from Rocky, which everyone sings.
"Gonna fly now. Flying high now..."
That's right!  And then you got, "Eye of the tiger."
"It's the eye of the tiger."
And "Living in America..."
Yeah! Hey, what about Bealtles music?
I don't think so...Not unless Rocky's girlfriend was Penny Lane...
Or one of "All the lonely people."
