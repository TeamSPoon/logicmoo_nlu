What do you think about the Falcon's chances this year?
I think they look good to win their division.
Do you see a possible Super Bowl run?
Possible, but I wouldn't bet on it.
Why not?
They have too many holes in their defense.
Makes you wish Deion Sanders could show up.
Only if "Prime Time" was in his prime.
I always thought he was a bit overrated.
He knew how to market himself.
What kind of record do you see them having?
Well, I'm thinking 10-6.
Wow, that's all?
There are some improved teams in their division.
I think they could win 12 games.
It's a possibility.
Do you think they will ever win it all in our lifetime?
I sure hope so.
You never know in pro football.
This is true.
