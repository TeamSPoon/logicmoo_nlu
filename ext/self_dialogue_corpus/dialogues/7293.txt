Did you see that they're finally making a live action version of Lion King?
I heard rumors but I didn't know that it was actually happening.
It's supposed to come out July 2019.
Cool! Lion King was my favorite movie when I was little.
I'm just glad that they got James Earl Jones to pay Mufasa again.
No one else could've voiced Mufasa besides him.
I agree. I think that Donald Glover will do a good job as Simba too.
He was a great actor in Atlanta, I believe he'll do this part justice.
I'm most excited for the songs to be remade.
The songs are what make any Disney movie!
