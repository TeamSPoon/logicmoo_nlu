What do you think about they way spiderman got his powers?
It happened all of a sudden
He was better off with those powers
It would be bad if he could not control them
His appearance changed right away
It would be hard for him to get in a car wreck because of not paying attention
His abilities could have made him a great athlete
It was nice that people came around to him
The Daily Bugle tried to make him seem like a criminal
It was nice that Peter Parker had some sway with them
