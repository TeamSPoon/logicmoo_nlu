do you think gagas songs are about herself?
some of them.
a lot are kinda soaked in metaphors though.
like judas. who knows what its really about.
betrayal i suppose. i doubt its really about jesus.
didnt the music video have her kissing with judas?
no, i dont think so. judas was hot though.
i should watch it again.
it is not essential.
i'm gonna listen to bad romance then
