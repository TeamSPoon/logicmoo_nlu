Did you ever see Adventures in Babysitting?
Yes, I had that on VHS growing up!
Didn't you love it?
It was one of my favorites.
Have you watched it in the past few years?
I actually bought it on DVD to show my husband.
What did he think?
He wasn't as enthused.  I remembered it being better too.
Oh, well that sucks.
Yeah, I was all excited, because I loved it growing up and then it just wasn't as good.
What was your favorite part?
I really like how the friend was stuck at the station and they kept going back to her.
The best was when she saw the kitten, right?
Yes!  I loved that part!
Wasn't there a homeless man bugging her?
Yeah, I think he needed to use the bathroom.
That's right!  He thought the phone booth was the bathroom!
Yeah, it was the little things that were hilarious.
They really were some funny moments.
Just not as many as I remembered.
