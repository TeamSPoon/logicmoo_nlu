Do you like disney movies?
Yea, generally.
Is it because you have kids?
No, I don't have kids, I just really like the animation and music.
Yea me too! It's nice not being judged for that.
It actually is inspiring me to draw more!
Really? That's great! It inspired me to become an animator, and my sister to become a voice actor!
That's amazing! Do you have a favorite?
It's too hard to choose! I'll sing along to any of them!
Me too!
