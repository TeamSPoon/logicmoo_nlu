Did you get a chance to see Straight Outta Compton?
No, I didn't how was it?
I liked it a lot. It felt like they really stuck to the story of NWA.
I heard they had to cut a lot of stuff out of the movie.
They did. One of things was when Dr. Dre's beat up Dee Barnes, among other things.
I wonder why they did that? All of the true fans know what happened.
I heard that the movie ran too long and they had to trim it down.
That makes sense. I wonder how long it was.
I think the final cut was over 3 and a half hours long, so that's why they trimmed it.
Wow, that would be like watching a hip hop Lord Of The Rings!
