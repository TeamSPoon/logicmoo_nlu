Hey, man what's your favorite Chuck Norris movie?
Delta Force and you?
Me, too! I love the chase scene in Beirut.
That's good, but when they storm the terrorist compound at the old school, that's better.
You have a point, I especially like when Chuck Norris shoots the radio after the one terrorist leaders offers to negotiate.
That is fun, and so's when the terrorist reinforcments charge the school, only to turn right around when Chuck triggers the explosive charges they rigged to it.
Yeah, that's funny, they're all gung-ho charging forward and then they are falling over each other to get away.
Yeah, but Lee Marvin has one of the best scences.
Which one?
The one where he has that captured guy call the terrorist in the plane, and he comes out yelling " what", and Marvin shoots him right between the eyes.
