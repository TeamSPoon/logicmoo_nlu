Have you gotten a chance to watch Moana yet?
Yes! I loved it so much! The music was awesome.
I know! How far I'll Go is my favorite song. It was so deep.
I know I don't live like her but I feel like I can relate so much! I bet lots of young girls feel that way, too.
It's also cool that Dwayne Johnson played Maui. He made a great demigod.
Is that who that was? I knew I recognized the voice! His song You're Welcome is so catchy.
It's also a great story, don't you think?
Definitely. She had to be strong and follow her heart to save her tribe. Not a lot of Disney princesses do that!
They don't! And most Disney princesses meet a prince and fall in love, it's cool that she was independent.
I agree. She's so inspirational for young girls!
