Which did you find scarier conjuring 1 or 2?
Hands down conjuring 1. It was way scarier and better performances all around.
I disagree for me the second was more frightening in general.
I will say Vera Farminga was very good in both.
She is the queen of horror to me.
Agreed. But the performance for the supporting actors was stronger in the first conjuring.
Maybe the daughters in the first one were all very good especially given the ages of some of them.
Exactly, I especially thought  Mackenzie Foy was great. i also loved her in interstellar.
She is a great little talent , sure we will see more of her. I liked Joey King.Patrick stewart was just  okay.
Funny patrick and King are both in the tv show fargo but different seasons.
