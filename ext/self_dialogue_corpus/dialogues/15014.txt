I love Uncle Buck.
I never seen that one.
It is an old one it's pretty funny.
Ever see Home Alone?
Yes I like that one.
Did you ever see Superbad?
Yes I love Superbad.
I like the end where they are staring at each other. It's like they can't be away from each other.
Yes they are best buddies.
It is definitely one of my favorites.
