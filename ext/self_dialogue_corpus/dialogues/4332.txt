So what's your favorite classic thriller?
Oh, I have so many favorites, don't ask me to choose. Touch of Evil is one of the greats, I guess
Yeah, I love that flick. The manly hero is Charlton Heston, and the lovely woman in jeopardy is Janet Leigh.
Un-huh. Suspense provided by lustful bomb-wielding gangsters for a thrill a minute, directed by Orson Welles. What's your favorite?
Hmm--maybe Night of the Hunter, from 1955. This time it's children in jeopardy.
Yeah, that evil sanctimonious preacher-man. He stalks the stolen loot, and goes after the innocent kids to get it.
Plus, he has LOVE tattooed on one hand, and HATE on the other. Robert Mitchum at his most terrifying.
Did you know Charles Laughton actually directed it? It's the only film he ever directed, and it's a suspense masterpiece.
Mitchum sterred in another wonderful thriller, too. I mean the original version of Cape Fear.
Yeah, Robert De Niro is a great actor, and he tried, but he had nothing on Mitchum in the remake.
