What do you think about the rapper Lil Boosie?
I love the dude, his song Smoking on Purple is an all time classic.
You can't get much better than that. I don't think he goes by "Lil Boosie" anymore though.
You're correct. He changed his rapper stage name after getting out of prison in 2014.
What's his stage name now?
It's "Boosie Badazz". I like his new name better then Lil Boosie.
I'm still going to call him Lil Boosie. I grew up listening to his music and that's just what I associate him with.
Hey man nothing wrong with that! What's your favorite Boosie album?
His first one is the best. The album is called Ghetto Stories.
I think that album was actually a duo album featuring Boosie and Webbie. Trill fam!
