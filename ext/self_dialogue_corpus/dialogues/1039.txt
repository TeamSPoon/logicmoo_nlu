Do you like the Eagles?
I do
They have a good squad
I gotta admit. I miss the old team
You mean the McNabb team?
Yes
They were really good
Yes they were. I liked their old team
Their team now is pretty good too
I don't see them making the playoffs though
They need some work
I think they have a good fan base though
Their games get very crazy
I agree
Have you ever been to a game of theirs?
Not yet
You gotta get tickets
I know. But they are expensive
It is worth it
You are so right. I need to see an Eagles game in person!
