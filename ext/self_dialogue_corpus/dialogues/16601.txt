What is up with the DJ?
I know! He's playing all Disco.
He'd better change it up, or I'm getting out of hear.
Wonder if he takes requests?
I don't know, but the booth is completely surrounded.
Please play some Rock for crying out loud.
Anything but this!
Oh, there go the Beegees.
Did you see the Grammys?
No. Missed it this year.
They did a tribute to the Beegees.
How was that?
Well, I'm not a Disco nut by any means, but it was pretty cool.
With those tight jeans they use to wear, no wonder they could hit those high notes.
You're such a dork.
I know!
Hey, let's hit that kareoke joint around the corner.
Can't be worse that this!
Cool. Let's go.
Just gotta grab my jacket.
