I can't wait for the football season to start! How about you?
I'm probably not the person to ask; I don't follow sports at all.
Really? I can't imagine that!
The closest I ever get is when a team from an area I have a connection with is playing. I'm from Seattle, so  go, Seahawks.
Bet they're gonna miss Marshawn Lynch.
No kidding! But they have some other standout players, too.
Any other reasons you watch besides hometown team?
I do like some of the videos Seahawks  have online, throwing a football into a tire from the stands was impressive.
Yeah, that does show off some of the special skills the players have.
I think it helps attract fans who maybe aren't that fond of football, but do grow to like the players as people.
I never thought of it that way; I bet that's right.
Another way to draw in fans, and business, of course.
Yeah, they make a lot of money on all the shirts, hats, etcetera.
I read that Russell Wilson brought in between $15-20 million last year!
Wow, it's amazing, isn't it?
I guess people want a piece of the action, one shirt at a time.
I can't even imagine the salaries they make besides.
It does eem pretty high, but being paid well to risk injury, and most aren't in the game for a long time.
I'm more into the games themselves and the action and how well the game is played.
I've read that when you are really involved in sports and other activities, it's almost as if you were really playing.
