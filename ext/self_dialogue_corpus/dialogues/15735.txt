I'm planning a pool party and trying to come up with some good music for it.
Beach Boys would be a good choice.
I've already picked some of their music.
Which songs?
Fun, Fun, Fun, Good Vibrations, Kokomo and Help Me Rhonda.
You might want to add California Girls, and Surfin Safari.
I forgot about those. Do you know of any other bands that had good surfing music?
Jan and Dean.
I'll check out their songs.
You might want to add some more contemporary songs that aren't surf music, but feel good.
Like what songs?
How about Don't Worry, Be Happy?
Isn't that by Bobby McFerrin?
It is. I would also suggest Happy by Pharrell Williams.
Oh i love that song.
The Best Day of My Life is another feel good song.
I could also toss in some old Beatles music. Everyone likes the Beatles.
I think you've come up with some really good music.
I'm very happy with the choices.
Don't forget to invite me to the party!
