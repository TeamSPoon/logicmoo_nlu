You know what I think?
What's that?
They should make a movie about Teddy Pendergrass.
They probably will.
I mean they made a movie about Toni Braxton and she's still alive.
I know right.
Did you see that tv movie about Michael Jackson?
Yeah I saw it.
Yeah I saw it.
It was kind of lame.
I know right?
I think the best movie made about a musical artist living or dead was The Temptations.
Oh I loved that movie.
I loved the movie and the music.
I like the movie that they did about The Jersey Boys.
I heard of the movie but I never actually knew the group.
I think it was based on Frankie Avalon.
I don't know, I never saw it.
Well it's nothing to write home about.
Oh, okay.
