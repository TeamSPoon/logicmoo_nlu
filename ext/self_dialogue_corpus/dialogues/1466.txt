Man, I can't wait for this NFL season to start.
Yeah, the draft this year was amazing and a lot of teams look really good on paper. Especially our Philadelphia Eagles.
YES! Derek Barnett I think was a great pickup in this years draft. He is the next Reggie White.
I'm more excited on the offensive side myself.
Who are you most excited about that we picked up?
Obviously Alshon Jeffrey. This guy can flat out play, I just hope he doesn't get hurt like he usually does.
I think their best pickup was LeGarrett Blount. How we picked him up without any issues is beyond me.
Yeah he was definitely a great pickup. I believe he has the most touchdowns for all running backs last year.
Well you can't deny the power and presence of this guy. Very intimidating indeed.
Yeah most definitely.
I'm just glad Carson Wentz has more weapons to his arsenal now.
Not only did we get two big name acquisitions, we also picked some great role players both in the draft and free agency.
I think Wendell Smallwood will be a key player in the offense.
Yeah, I don't think Sproles can handle a full load for the team. He is great but needs breaks.
I just hope our defense comes up big for us. I don't think we did enough to shore up our holes in that secondary
Well, Malcom Jenkins should have another great year. Sidney was a good draft pick, and the line up front should release some of the pressure of the secondary.
I just hope no one gets hurt. That's what hurt the team the most the last couple years.
Well, I dunno what it is, but we as a team in whole tend to have a lot of key injuries.
Well let's hope no injuries this year.
Agreed!!
