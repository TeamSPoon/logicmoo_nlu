Hey, So I just saw this movie and I think you´ll find very interesting.
Really which one? What is it about?
It´s called Nerve. You can watch it now on Netflix. It´s about a dangerous online game.
Online game? How could that be dangerous?
No seriously it is, you have to watch it to understand. It´s a kinda of truth or dare, but pretty only dares.
Oh ok, then I do understand, that could get pretty dangerous.
I really liked it but once you see it, I would like your opinion about it.
Why do you want my opinion of it, if you said you already liked it?
Because I´m critical of movies and even though I liked it, some parts did not looked very real.
Oh I see. Don't worry then, I will see it this weekend.
Yes you should, it has very good young actors.
Oh really, like whom?
Emma Roberts, Dave Franco.
Emma Roberts? Isn´t that Julia Roberts niece?, I guess I will like it then.
Yes you will. If you like this actress then, you should also see the movie We´re the Millers, it´s very funny.
Oh I know, I already saw it, plus I also love how Jennifer Aniston acts.
Me too! Is there any special movie you could also recommend of Jennifer Aniston?
Yes definitely, Mother´s Day, Just Go with it, The Bounty Hunter, Marley & Me.. there are many good ones.
Which one do you recommend, and why?
Watch Marly & Me, if you love or like dogs, this one will sure make you cry.
