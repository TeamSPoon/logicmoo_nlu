Are you a bigger fan of Star Wars or Star Trek?
I definitely liked Star Wars more growing up.
Who was your favorite character?
Han Solo was my favorite.
He's definitely the coolest character in the series.
They are supposed to be making some movies that he is the focus of in the future.
I've heard about that. Harrison Ford is still a great actor, so they should be very good.
I heard they just had to replace the directors for those movies.
I'm sure they will still be good anyway.
Rogue One was a very good movie. Episode I: The Phantom Menace was the only one that I didn't think lived up to the quality of the series.
