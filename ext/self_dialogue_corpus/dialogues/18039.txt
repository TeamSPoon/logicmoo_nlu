What's your favorite music  decade.
I would have to say the 70s overall for music.
Oh, what groups do you like.
I hate to admit it but I really like the BeeGees.
Everyone did back in High School, later no one admitted it.
Yeah, from cool to lame in a few years.
Who else?
How about Rod Stewart?
Hard to believe he's been around so long but his stuff is easy to listen to.
Tonight's the Night hit #1 didn't it?
Two songs really got me into music back then, the first was Stairway to Heaven.
Oh yea, Zeppelin's best.
The other was Bohemian Rhapsody.
Anything from News of the World.
Yep, I even liked Sheer Heart Attack.
I liked Fly Away from the B side.
I can think of 2 other classics.  The first is Free Bird.
Southern anthem is still one of my favorite songs.
The 2nd one is completely different, Hotel California.
That was like the second song that I ever memorized.
