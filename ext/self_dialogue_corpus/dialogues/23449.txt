Are you going to see Wonder Woman/
I don't know.
Why not?
DC is not putting out very good movies.
I kind of agree.
Marvel is really stomping them.
Agreed.
Are you going to see it.
I think so.
I'm not really impressed with the casting.
Yeah, the girl seems a bit patite.
I know. She's supposed to be an Amazon.
With girls that frail the men surely would have taken over.
Sexist!
Just saying.
Well she's no Linda Evans.
Who?
TV's Wonder Woman.
That was a statuesque woman.
Indeed!
