I watched Wayne's World for the first time in forever the other day!
I haven't seen that in a while either. How does it hold up?
I still really enjoyed it. Mike Myers and Dana Carvey are hilarious as Wayne and Garth.
Rob Lowe plays the bad guy, right?
Yup. "Benjamen". All kind of people in the cast.
I love the scene where they go see Alice Cooper in concert. The backstage part especially.
Speaking of the music, the bohemian rhapsody scene is classic.
People still act out that scene out when the song plays.
Chris Farley only has the small part as the security guard, but he shows up.
He gives them all of the information about the record executive, right?
Yeah. So Cassandra can get signed to a major label or whatever.
And then you have the multiple endings.
The sad ending, the Scooby Doo ending, the mega happy ending.
Who directed it?
Penelope Spheeris. She did Black Sheep and a few other movies.
She didn't have anything to do with Wayne's World 2 did she?
I don't think so. I remember that's the one where they set up "Waynestock", but that one I have yet to revisit.
I'm pretty sure Chris Farley is in that one more.
Wayne's World one is the best thing Mike Myers has written for sure.
Or that Dana Carvey has starred in.
