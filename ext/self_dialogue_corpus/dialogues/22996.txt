What is your favorite childhood movie?
I loved Jumanji! How about you?
Wow, that was my favorite movie too!
I pretty much love any movie with Robin Williams.
Me too! He is hilarious and such a great actor.
Did you know the little girl in the movie was Kirsten Dunst?
Really? I never put two and two together on that one. I will have to watch it again!
I didn't realize until I watched it as an adult. I was like wow, that's Kirsten Dunst!
That's funny. Now that you mention it I can kind of imagine her as the little girl.
What other Robin Williams movies do you like?
Have you ever heard of Jack?
No, is Robin Williams in that?
Yes! It is one of my very favorites, right up there with Jumanji.
What is it about?
Robin William plays a little boy who gets old way faster than regular children.
Wow, I can't believe I have never seen that! When did it come out?
I think it was around 1996.
I will definitely check that out. Are there any other notable actors in it?
Jennifer Lopez is his teacher in the movie and Diane Lane is his mother.
Awesome! I'm going to buy a copy now.
