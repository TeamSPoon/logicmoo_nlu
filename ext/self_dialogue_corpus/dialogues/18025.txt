Have you listened to Emenem?
No, I'm not really a fan of rap.
You should listen to him! You might like him!
I'll give it a shot! The most rap I've Listened to is 21 pilots.
Oh, they're good! What's your favorite song?
I like "radio"!
That's a good one! The Whole blurry face album is great.
Yeah, It's one of my favorites!
Have you listened to any other rap?
Not really, I just can't really get into it as much.
Why is that?
It just isn't very musical!
Yeah, I guess 21 Pilots is good for that! They have a lot of melodic content.
Yeah, that's what I like.
You Might like Emenem then! He has a lot of melodic songs.
Okay, I'll give him another try!
You might also listen to Ludacris too! He's good.
Who should I listen to first?
Ememem is a good place to start!
Okay, Great!
