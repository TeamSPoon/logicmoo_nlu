Have you seen Black Coat's Daughter?
Yes, last week. Did you like it?
I did and didn't. Did you?
I think you should elaborate more. I did like it.
Fair enough, I enjoyed that it was an original take on a horror movie. I disliekd how slow the pacing was.
I did also find it very slow. But I think that created the tension to some degree.
Probably true. What I also found tricky was that emma roberts was suppose to be the one character Kat grown up.
Ya, that took me a while to figure out, those actresses don't really look alike to me.
Exactly. I will say it is one of those films that stays with you after.
Yes I find myself relfecting on moments or thinking of it after too.
