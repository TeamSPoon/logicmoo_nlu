Seen any good movies lately?
Yeah, I finally broke down and saw suicide squad!
Oh, I loved that movie, what did you think?
I really liked it!
Do you like superhero movies?
Yeah, I just always forget I like them, haha
Me, too. Have you seen the new Guardian's of the Galaxy?
No, I haven't seen the first one either. Are they good?
Oh my, yes! they're the best!
Really? The commercials always made them look pretty cheesy!
No, the first one was so cute and sweet.
Hmmm, maybe I will watch it this weekend.
You should, I'm going to go see the second one this weekend.
That's cool, its been forever since I've gone to the movies.
Well if you like the first one, you should come with!
Okay, I'll watch it tonight.
Sweet, we could make it  a double feature and go see Wonder Woman too.
I'm not sure about that, I've heard a lot of negative stuff.
I think the reviews are mixed, we can stick with just the Guardians of the Galaxy though.
Sweet, sounds good.
