Who do you think is going to have the best offense in the NFL this year?
That is a tough question, there are a few good options.
Yes, but there are some obvious choices.
For sure. The Falcons should really be able to put up some point.
I agree. Julio Jones is unstoppable.
Yes, he is too tall for a lot of the defenders.
I know what you mean. He can have 3 guys covering him and he can still jump higher to catch the ball.
I also think that the Tampa Bay Bucks are going to break out this year.
I agree. They added D. Jackson, his deep threat is going to open the field up for Mike Evans.
Yes, Mike Evans is another big bodied receiver. He will be great this year.
Do you have a third team that will have a top offense?
Perhaps Green Bay will be back in form this year.
That is quite possible.
Jordy Nelson should be fully healed, and they got rid of Eddie Lacy.
Yeah, Lacy was not as good as he could have been on that team.
I hope the Seahawks can get him running right this year.
If any team can it will be them
I know, they are built to run and run all day long.
Yes, their defense takes a lot of time off the clock, and so does running the ball.
Yes, faster pace teams struggle against them.
