What was the name of Ringo Starr's band?
You are talking about the Beatles, right?
Well, Ringo Starr from the Beatles, but his other band.
He had a band after the Beatles?
Yeah, I think it was a play on his name.
Wait, wasn't it something like The All-Stars?
Yeah, something like that.
Why are you asking?
I was just looking for one of their albums.
Oh, I never really listened to their stuff.
