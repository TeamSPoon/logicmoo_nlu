Who's your favorite character of the whole Marvel Universe?
I would have to say Deadpool. He's a cutup.
He really is. I watched that movie every day for a week when it first came to DVD.
I probably watched it almost as much. I loved the George Michael song at the end.
Oh Careless Whispers? Yes that's actually my favorite song of his.
What was your favorite scene from the movie?
The part where he had the battle at the end with Francis. The final showdown.
Right it was hilarious and well choreographed.
One of the rare movies where the comic relief friend isn't as funny as the main character.
That's true. Ryan Reynolds is hilarious and I love how he pokes fun at himself in the movie.
