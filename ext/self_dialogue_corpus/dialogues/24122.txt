Your favorite movie director, go.
Ahh, such a hard one....
You gotta narrow it down to one person.
Okay, well....don't judge, but I've been digging Michael Bay lately.
What? Seriously?
Yeah, he directs the Transformers series.
Yeah, I know but....he's not that good.
What do you mean?
Bad dramatics, cheap explosions for everything, etc.
I don't know, I kinda like bad explosions.
Well who else do you like?
Oh, I really like Christopher Nolan.
Yes, he's an amazing director!
I love the Dark Night.
Me too, with Heath Ledger.
Yep, RIP the best Joker.
He's also coming out with a new movie, Dunkirk.
Yeah, about the Normandy battle?
Yep, I wanna see it so bad!
Me too.
