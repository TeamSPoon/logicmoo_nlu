I know you have always liked the Beatles.  Which member has been your favorite?
I have always appreciated Ringo's drumming abilities and I like it when he sings.
Yes, I really liked when he sang "Act Naturally".  Do you recall any songs by George?
When he set out on his own, I really liked "My Mind Set on You" and "Here Comes the Sun".
I liked those as well.  In the early days it was mostly Paul and John doing all the singing.
You can't beat the early songs -- "She Loves You" and "She Was Just Seventeen".
I remember their early days on TV.  What did your family think of their singing?
My father was flabbergasted!  He had never heard of such a thing.  He couldn't believe I actually liked them.
My whole family was glued to the TV.  I remember the audience screaming during "All My Loving".
Yes, and the program put each of their names on the TV screen.  For John, they put "Sorry girls. He's married."!
