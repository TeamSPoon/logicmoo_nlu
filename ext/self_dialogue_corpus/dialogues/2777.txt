Yea, I just hope that some new teams will come through the ranks soon.
Yea, there are a couple teams that had really strong drafts and maybe that will help turn the tables.
Yea, I think it will pretty much be the same teams, but there are always a few new ones.
Who do you think will surprise this year?
Hmmmm maybe Tampa.
You think? Why so?
Well, Jameis Winson. That guy can play!
Yea, he sure can and with the addition of Desean Jackson, he has somebody he can count on down field.
Yea, that will help any quarterback and for him, it definitely should.
Yea, I think it is time that they start really competing.
Jamies has been in the league for a couple of years now and nows how to win, but it's time to put it all together.
I agree! He has it in him, but he just needs to do it.
Yea, he does. I think he will.
Yea, I agree. That was a good pick.
Thanks! I think Tennessee could surprise in the other conference as well.
Both teams have good young quarterbacks and a couple of playmakers around them.
Yea, that is usually the recipe for success.
It is and I think that it will work this time as well.
I agree! It might and I'm looking forward to seeing it.
Yea, it should be a good fun year.
