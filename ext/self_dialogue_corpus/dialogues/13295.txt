Who has the coolest lightsaber?
Jeez, i like mace windus purple saber.
thats a good one. purple is awesome.
its my favorite color. Yoda's is cool too.
what about the siths
I like darth mauls double saber.
That was iconic. i like kylos sword saber thing.
Thats pretty damn cool too.
maul is a bit cooler though because of his moves with it.
indeed. thats my second favorite.
