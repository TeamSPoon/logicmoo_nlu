Whats your favorite Disney movie

I heard that it 's a boring movie though
No, I love animals and I love cats so the story is very fun
what's it even about
a group of rich cats get kidnapped by a butler and try to find their way back home

In 1970. It was Walt Disney's last film that he worked on
Wow, it has a special meaning to the Disney company then
