Hey, who's your favorite jam band?
I like Phish but by favorite is still The Grateful Dead?
really, the Dead? They are ancient, are they even still playing?
well sort of, Jerry died back in the 90's but the rest of the band still play.
Who is taking Jerrys place?
John Mayer did for a while
Really, that doesn't seem like the best fit.
I agree, but he's a good guitarist.
I thought I heard about the guy from Phish playing with them.
He did for a while.
Trey Anastasio right?
Yes, he played those big shows in Chicago.
He seems like a better fit than John Mayer.
I agree, I've listened to both and Trey did a better job.
Do you know if there are recordings of those shows?
Yes, you can find them on Spotify.
Have you heard them?
Yes, I've listened to both shows a couple of time.
Sweet bro.
Yeah man, good stuff.
