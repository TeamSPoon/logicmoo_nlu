What is your favorite comedy movie?
I think it would have to be Ace ventura Pet Detective.
Yea, that was a really funny movie.
I liked Jim Carrey, he was epic.
There were so many funny parts, especially how easy it was to do those voices.
I think its probably my favorite movie of all time.
I wouldnt go that far, but I love Jim Carey movies
Let's do a marathon of Ace Ventura this weekend!
I'm totally in.
I can't wait!
