I recently started listening to pop music again.
What made you do that?
Well, for the last few years I just haven't enjoyed it like I used to.
Who are some of the artist that you enjoy listening to?
I like Bruno Mars a lot.
Oh me too. He took off over the last few years.
I agree I think he has matured as an artist.
I think that the same thing happened with Justin Timberlake a few years ago.
It did and also some of the solo artists in One Direction.
Like Harry Styles's new song.
I am really loving that song too.
I know when it comes on the radio I have to just listen.
Now speaking of listening. I can not listen to Ariana Grande anymore.
Yeah, she has started grating on my nerves.
All her songs sound the same and are over sexualized.
I know what is that about. Most of who she is marketed to are tweens and teens.
I do still love Taylor Swift.
Me too she has stayed true to herself.
If she could just get her love life right.
Yes that is so true!
