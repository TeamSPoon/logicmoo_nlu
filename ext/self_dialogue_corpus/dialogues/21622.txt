Hey did you see the latest XXX movie?
There's a new XXX movie?  Wow, the other one is super old!
I know!  It's kinda wild they waited so long to make a sequel.
For sure!  What's it called?
XXX: The Return of Xander Cage.  It's got Vin Diesel in it again.
Whoah, he's still around.  Well, I guess he kinda made the movie.
Exactly, like what would it be without him?
Yes.  So how was it?
I thought it was totally disappointing.
Are you serious?  That's sad to hear.
Yeah I know.  I loved the original XXX.
So did I.  Why did you think it was so bad?
Well I couldn't get into the plot.  The characters were also really lame.
What do you mean by lame?
They were poorly developed and I didn't recognize any of the actors or actresses.
What was the plot even about?
I couldn't even tell you!  I was so bored and confused that my mind kept drifting off.
Oh yeah, I hate it when that happens.
Yeah I even fell asleep at the end, which is sad to say during an action movie.
Wow, I will be sure not to watch that one.
