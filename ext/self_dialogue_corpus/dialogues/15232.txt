What was the name of that song you played for me the other day?
"Every Rose Has Its Thorn" by Poison. I still can't believe you'd never heard it.
Well, I wasn't born until 1995.
That's true. You missed out on 80s hair band scene.
Yeah, I really loved that song though. Do you have any other recommendations?
Slow songs or just good songs in general?
Slow songs. I like the romantic stuff.
"Without You" by Motley Crue is really romantic.
I'll have to look that one up. What else?
If you want more Poison, try "I Won't Forget You" or "Life Goes On".
Great! Yeah, I really like that guy's voice.
Bret Michaels.
Yeah, he's awesome. What else?
Try "Heaven" by Warrant. That was always one of my favorites.
What about Bon Jovi? Is their early stuff any good?
Of course! Try "I'll Be There for You" or "Born to Be My Baby". "Living on a Prayer" is also really awesome.
Okay, I'll write that down.
Make sure you put down Skid Row, too. "I Remember You" is a gorgeous song.
I will, thanks!
You're welcome! Let me know when you need more suggestions.
