I saw a replay of the first Superbowl last night.
Wasn't it not called the Superbowl?
Right, it was called a World Championship game.
Who played?
The Kansas City Chiefs versus the Green Bay Packers.
Cool.  Was it televised?
Yes, on two networks!
Why was that?
NBC had the AFL rights and CBS had the NFL rights.
Who scored first?
Green Bay, 7-0, first quarter.
What happened in the second quarter?
Kansas City tied it, but Green Bay scored another touchdown before KC had a field goal.
How was the halftime show?
Not bad.  Al Hirt and two college marching bands.
What happened next?
The Packers scored 14 in the third and 7 in the final quarter.
KC?
They never scored again.
A victory for the NFL.
