I love your Moana t-shirt! Did you love that movie?
Yes, even my boys love to watch it and they already know all of the songs and sing along.
How cute! Yes, those songs are catchy....like the songs from Frozen!
Which Disney princess is your favorite?
I love Aurora from Sleeping Beauty. She was always the one I wanted to be growing up.
Really? I thought you were more of a Pocohantas type, a free spirit. Like, running through the woods barefoot and stuff.
I remember watching Pocohontas in the theatres and collecting the figurines from Happy Meal toys.
Are you going to see Cars 3?
I don't think we will go see it in the theatres, I can't get the kids to really pay attention to the Cars movies, but definitely when it comes out on video.
We are planning to see it this week. I hope it will be good! I love hearing Owen WIlson's voice as Lightning McQueen.
