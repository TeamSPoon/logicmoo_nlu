Did you ever watch the movie Cars?
The animation movie for kids?
Yes that one.
Yeah, I have a little one so we watched it together.
I actually liked it.
I did too, which was a surprise.
Do you usually enjoy the movies your kids do?
Not often.
This one was well done I thought and meant for a more broader audience.
I can't agree more even my teens like it and they've sworn off cartoons all together.
What did you think of the story?
I liked it though I liked the characters more.
Let me guess motor or whatever the junker cars name was.
Yep I loved his character.
I figured you like him at the very least.
Though I did like the hero story it was good.
Me too, my kids watch it all the time now.
Mine too they can't wait to see the other movies.
There are more?
Three in total I think.
