what do you think about Drake?
I think he's cool and one of my friend's mimicing his hair style as well, haha
can't deny that's a fashionable hair style
yeah, do you like him? What's your favorite song from him?
yeah, I do. I actually listen to his music a lot this summer, what was that song that has Drake dancing in a light cube?
you mean Hotline Bling?
oh yes! it's an addictive song, and the music video is even more addictive
you mean those mock up videos that were created after the original one?
haha, exactly
I couldn't stop watching them either, so hilarious
