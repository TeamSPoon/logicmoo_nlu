Hey
Hey got a question to ask you
Sure go ahead
How do you feel on music production
What do you mean
Like what is your thoughts on how it is produced
Well it is hard to pick
I sort of favor underproduction
That does have its merits
I hate over production though
Why
Why else
huh
Because it lacks soul
How so
Because it sounds sterile to me
Eh
It does for real
I am fine with it
Not me at all
