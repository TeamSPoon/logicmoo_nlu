Has football season started?
i don't know...which is weird...
so are you a cowboys fan?
hell, yeah!
Do you feel sorry for Tony?
A little bit
It must be hard knowing that you've aged out ..
Well, he's rich if that helps any...
I saw that interview he did about Dax
I thought he showed a lot of class, but I wonder if that's how he really feels
I'm pretty sure that's how the cowboys fans feel
Why do you say that?
Their record last season improved when Tony got injured and stayed out for so long and...
right, when Dax came in and took over
but they still didn't get anywhere that mattered
i think this seasons will be the cowboys season for sure
why?
because they don't have to watch Romo break another collarbone
And then there's the issue of Romo actually coaching the team from the sidelines
yep, there's that. i wonder if he gets extra for doing that
