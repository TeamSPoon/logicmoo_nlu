Do you like that coffee house style music?
You mean like Amos Lee?
Yes, or Jason Mraz.
Yeah, it's nice and relaxing.  Good for if I'm just chilling out at home.
Or you know, in a coffee shop.
You know who else is good?  The Plane White T's.
Yeah they are.
That relaxing acoustic style is pretty good.
Back to Amos Lee, what songs do you like from him?
I really liked Sweet Pea.
Yeah me too.  And Arms of a Woman.
Oh man, talk about just great relaxing songs.
You know who he reminds me of?
Who?
Ray Lamontange.
Oh yeah, like Trouble.
Good song.  It just makes me smile and relax knowing things are ok.
Yeah, that's what this stuff is about.
Yeah, what about Jason Mraz?   Anything you like from him?
I always liked I'm Yours.
