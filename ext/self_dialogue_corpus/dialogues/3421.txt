What horror movie are you looking forward to seeing in theaters?
Flatliners.
Oh right, I totally forgot that was coming out this year.
I think it comes out in September.
Isn't Ellen Page in that movie?
She is one of the main characters. It also stars my favorite Nina Dobrev.
I read somewhere that Kiefer Sutherland makes an appearance too.
I didn't know that. The trailer I saw never showed him.
Ya, I think he is playing the same character he played in the original movie.
That make me even more excited to see it!
