Oh my goodness did you see the Dunkirk trailer yet?
For the World War II movie?
Yeah, that's the one! It comes out this summer.
I saw it, I just didn't think you were a WWII film kinda guy.
I mean not necessarily, but this is a Nolan film so I'd go see it no matter what it was about.
Wait, Christopher Nolan did this? I love his films!
He's easily one of the best directors currently making original works.
Oh for sure! The Prestige is just a masterpiece.
I agree, I think it's his best.
Even more than Inception?
I honestly thought Inception was more predictable, but the Prestige just had so much care in the details.
Yeah, but Inception is classic.
It does have some incredible special effects, I'll give it that.
That's because Nolan puts so much effort in to keeping all his effects in camera.
I heard about that, didn't he really build all his sets or something?
I don't know about all, but I know he built the rotating room in Inception.
Oh! And he also really had people do that plane scene in the beginning of The Dark Knight Rises.
His Batman trilogy is also amazing.
The Dark Knight is easily my favourite super hero film of all time.
Oh I totally agree. I guess I'll have to see Dunkirk after all!
