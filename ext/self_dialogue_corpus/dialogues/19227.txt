Oh can we listen to some Melanie Martinez? Please?
Not again! You always want to listen to Melanie Martinez.
She's amazing, her songs describe my life perfectly. Besides you always want to listen to Hamilton.
Because Hamilton is legendary. I completely relate to Alexander Hamilton's struggles.
How do you relate to Alexander Hamilton? Melanie Martinez sings about real life.
She dresses like a goth toddler. Alexander Hamilton wanted to change the world!
He wanted to be rich and famous. Melanie is an artist.
Of course she is, but I don't like her art. Lin Manuel-Miranda is a musical genius.
Genius? Don't you think that hyperbolic. The guy rapped on PBS.
He rapped brilliantly! Silent e is a Ninja is a great piece.
You think The Electric Company is better than Melanie Martinez? You're crazy.
I don't hate Melanie, you just listen to her all the time. I'm bored of her.
Well if I hear Cabinet Battle #1 again, I'm going scream.
Fine. We'll listen to Famer, Refuted.
And then Dollhouse?
Why? Because it's about real life?
Yes. My real life!
Can we at least listen to Cry Baby.
You just don't get me.
Fine. We'll listen to Fall Out Boy.
