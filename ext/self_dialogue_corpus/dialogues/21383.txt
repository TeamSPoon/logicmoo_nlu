Who is your least favorite actor?
I guess I'd probably say Nicholas Cage?
Nick Cage? That guy is a riot! He's so goofy and fun!
So goofy and awful, you mean.
Oh, man, his performance in Con Air is one of my favorite 'good bad' performances of all time.
I barely remember watching that movie on cable one night, years ago.
With that corny Southern accent. 'Why couldn't you put down the bunny?' Hahaha.
He just seems super over-the-top and annoying most of the time.
I respect the effort that he puts into each role. Regardless of the script, he gives his all.
Well, but usually the script is terrible, especially recently.
It's true, he hasn't been very choosy recently.
He's been choosing, just bad movies! Did you see The Sorcerer's Apprentice?
I saw a trailer for it, and it didn't look good.
Spoilers: It was in fact not good.
I prefer to think about peak Nicholas Cage. How about Leaving Las Vegas?
Yeah, he was alright in that. Like 30 years ago.
Either way, I think he won the Oscar for that performance.
He might have, you might be right.
So, just saying - your least favorite actor was once the best actor in the world.
I still don't like him, what can I say? He just grates on me.
