Have you seen Rough Night?
Is that the one where the women kill someone during a party?
Yes, that is the one.
No, I haven't seen that one.  Is it any good.
Yeah, it was really funny.
So who is in it?
Scarlett Johansson is the big star, but it has a bunch of other people you would recognize.
So they have a party and someone ends up getting killed?
Yeah.  Scarlett Johansson is getting married, so some old college friends throw her a bachelorette party in Miami.
And things end up going too far?
The end up killing someone and spend the rest of the movie trying to figure out what to do about it.
Doesn't really sound like that original an idea.
No, the concept has been done before, but they pull it off pretty well.
Is this something that I could take my kid to see?
Probably not, it has an R rating, and it earned it.
Would it make a good date night movie?
You both have a bit of a dark sense of humor, so it would probably work out pretty well.
Cool, we will go see it next week.
I hope you enjoy it.
Thank you.
