I need ideas on new music to listen to.
I know, my music selection is getting pretty stale.
What have you been listening to lately?
Well, in terms of new stuff I like a few newer pop songs.
Like what?
Well, I like Selena Gomez, It Ain't Me and Something Just Like This by the Chainsmokers and Coldplay.
I really liked Something Just Like This when it first came out but then it was played every ten seconds on every station and got old fast.
True, I definitely don't love it now as much as I did at first before I heard it a million times. I think that's pretty typical.
I do like Coldplay though. I used to listen to a lot of their stuff.
I do too but I have to be in the right mood for it because sometimes their music is so slow and sad it can be tough to listen to.
I know what you mean. I feel that way about their song Yellow.
Have you heard the newer Imagine Dragons song, Thunder?
I'm not sure. I probably have.
It's great. I love Imagine Dragons.
I couldn't get enough of their first album, Night Visions.
Same here, I love their song Radioactive from that album.
The band is going on tour and stopping in the Northeast this Fall.
That sounds like so much fun. I've heard they're amazing in concert.
I want to hear them sing Bleeding Out live.
Let me know if you get tickets!
