People seem to think that Disney is only recently doing live action movies.
I know. They have terrific animated movies but they've also been doing live action for many, many years.
I loved seeing 20,000 Leagues Under The Sea.
Oh yes, Kirk Douglas was really good in it.
I also went on the ride in Disneyland but kind of freaked out.
How so?
You go inside a really tight, enclosed replica of the submarine and I discovered that I have a touch of claustrophobia.
That's one heck of a time to find that out.
It sure is. Good thing I was a cute little 4 year old when it happened and everyone took pity on me when I sort of freaked out.
Cute goes far in getting you out of things!
