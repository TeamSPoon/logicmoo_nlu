Seen any good movies recently?
Yes, I saw Hell or High Water the other day
I haven't heard of that one
Oh, it's really good.
What's it about.
Bank robbing in small town Texas
Any big stars?
Jeff Bridges and Chris Pine
Oh I look both those guys
Yeah, Bridges plays a sheriff and Pine is one of the robbers.
Oh really? Usually Chris Pine is a good guy.
Well there's a bit of a twist in this one.
I see.
It also stars Ben Foster.
Ben Foster? That's not ringing any bells.
He's been a few big hits. 3:10 to Yuma is the one I can think of right now.
Oh, the guy with blonde hair?
Yes, that's the one.
Nice. I like his work.
Yeah, he's really good in this one.
