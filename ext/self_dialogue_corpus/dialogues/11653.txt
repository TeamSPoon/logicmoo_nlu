So, it's crazy, my boyfriend said he doesn't like the Beatles.
Wait, are you serious? How can you not like the Beatles?
I know, I asked him the same thing.
What did he say?
I guess he said it's because they played the song Yellow Submarine a lot at one of his jobs and he just got tired of it.
I guess I can see that. That song could get annoying, but what about the other songs?
I'm not sure. I think maybe he just doesn't like them because he thinks they're over-rated.
Well, they are pretty great, but I guess people do kind of worship them.
Yeah that's true. Good thing they're not my favorite band or something.
Yeah, I hope my future boyfriend likes the Beatles!
