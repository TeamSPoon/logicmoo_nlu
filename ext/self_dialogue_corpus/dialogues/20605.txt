Did you ever see the movie The Cutting Edge?
The one from the nineties with Moira Kelly and D. B. Sweeney?
Yes that one.
Sure, it is on my top ten movie list.
I love this film because the story is so great.
Sure, it is romantic, funny, and dramatic.
I still use some of the lines in my everyday conversations sometimes.
Ha ha! You mean like when Doug says I've been doing a little figure skating?
Yeah and the old guy says fingerpainting.
Yes that is funny and also "Gretzky, no one is coming for you".
I loved Moira Kelly's character and how she managed to loosen up over time.
Yes, you really wanted Kate and Doug to get together.
I love when they are on each others nerves.
Like when they are training and running and she pushes him off the road.
Or when they are starting to skate together and she gets him to fall on his face.
Yes, toe pick!!! Ha ha!
I love the ending so much.
Yes it was a great ending. I love when he tells her that somehow between all they had gone through that he loved her.
Yes and she said that they should do that complicated move and then they do it and win.
We assume they win of course because it ends with them kissing.
