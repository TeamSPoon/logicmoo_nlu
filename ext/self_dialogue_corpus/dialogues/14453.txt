You know what's funny though?
What?
If we look at the points per game, Jabbar doesn't really rank that high.
But he's a legend everyone says.
Yep. Even was in that Kung Fu movie
What does he rank at, then?
He's at 14th in terms of points per game.
Who do you think can break Jabbar record?
His total points over career record?
Yes.
Hm. that's a tough one. We have to see who's most likely to last as long as Jabbar did
And score at least as much per game as he did.
Yep.
Can Lebron do it?
I'm thinking, if he stays healthy, yes. he's currently behind 9600 points to match Jabbar's record, and he's 499 games behind Jabbar
How long has Lebron been playing? 13 years?
Something like that. And he's still on his top game, more or less. And in a season there are 82 games, so, 6 more years which is about the same length of career as Jabbar
But he averages 27 points per game which is better than Jabbar.
Let's see, if Lebron plays all the games in the next 6 years, and scores the average he's been doing, then he will amass 13473 points which will shatter Jabbar's record
Now, will he, or can he stay healthy enough for that?
