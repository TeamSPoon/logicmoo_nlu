What is your favorite era of rap?
I liked the 2000's because we had artist like Jay Z, Kanye West, Nas, Eminem and Lil Wayne.
I like the 90's because we had Tupac, Biggie, Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg.
I love all eras except today's era.
I agree, people like Migos and Lil Uzi are ruining the genre.
One thing in rap that hasen't been lost are the samples, they make for great songs.
I love samples in rap music!
California Love and Mo Money Mo problems are my favorite samples.
Rap isn't dead because we still have some guys that are making good rap music.
Yes and those guys and girls will be legends just like the people from the 90's.
