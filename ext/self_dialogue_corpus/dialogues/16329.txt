I have been listening to the last David Bowie album a lot.
It's very emotional as he knew he was going to die.
I love the song, "I Can't Give Everything Away."
David Bowie has always been one of my favorites.
Did you know that he wrote China Girl with Iggy Pop?
Yes, and Iggy Pop actually recorded it first.
Oh, wow.  I didn't know that.  What's your favorite Bowie album?
Station to Station.
Yeah, that's a great album.  I especially like "Word on a Wing."  I like the Diamond Dogs album the best.
Hey, did you know that Nina Simone recorded "Word on a Wing"? I don't know who did it first.
I don't either but I could listen to Nina Simone all day.
Speaking of Iggy Pop, I saw him in New York in March.
He's great live.  I haven't seen him in years.  Have you seen his instagram?
No, but I've seen his bird's instagram.
HIs bird has an instagram.
Yeah, it's called "biggypop", because his bird is called Biggy and it is hilarious.
Really, why?  I can't picture Iggy with a bird.
He sings to it and it flies around his house.  The bird moves it's head to the music and dances.
That is so funny.  Iggy Pop is awesome.
I'm going to listen to "The Passenger" right now.
