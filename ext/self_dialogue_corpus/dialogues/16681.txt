Do you like dance music?
What type, do you mean electronic dance music?
Yes, EDM. I've been listening to it a lot lately.
What have you been listening to? Anything good?
Actually, yes. Have you heard of DJ Snake?
No, what are some of his songs?
He has one with Justin Bieber that was popular. It's called Let Me Love You.
Oh, I've heard that one. It has a pretty good beat.
If you like that you should listen to his song Middle. That song features bipolar sunshine.
The English singer?
Yes, it's a great song. The song 'Talk' is supposed to be good too. It combines EDM with tropical house sounds.
What album are these songs on?
The album is named Encore.
Great, anything else I should listen for?
Well, in terms of music from DJs, I like Calvin Harris.
Oh, me too. Didn't he date Taylor Swift?
Yes, but he makes good music too. Listen to his song featuring Florence Welch, it's amazing.
What's it called?
It's called 'Sweet Nothing'. The music video is pretty interesting too but don't watch it if domestic violence triggers you.
Okay, I'm interested in watching it now. I wish good music videos were released as often as they used to be.
