What's your favorite thing about the NFL?
I think it's how anyone can be good in any year.
Who do you think will be good this year?
Probably the Patriots again but there are some sleepers.
Which teams are a good sleeper pick?
Well I like the Panthers and Saints to make some noise in the NFC.
How do you think Brees and Newton will look this year?
Newton should have a better year. I think Brees puts up a lot of points again.
I'm excited about the new LA teams.
yeah the rams and chargers both in LA.  that is crazy.
It's like the old days I guess.
I wonder if either of them will be any good.
Well the Rams always play good defense.  The Chargers play good offense.
if only they could combine into a superteam.
They will probably wouldn't be able to beat the Patriots.
What about the Packers this year?
I think they will be tough too, and they always seem to score points.
Any good defenses to watch?
I think the Bills defense will surprise some people.
I'm excited to find out.
