Hey, who do think has one the most championship titles in the NFL?
Oh, that's easy. The Green Bay Packers.
Really, the Packers?
Yeah, they have 13 championships. They are the winningest team in all the NFL.
Really, 13? That's a lot but I thought San Francisco had more.
No that is a common mistake that everyone makes, but they are not even in the top 5!
Really? How many championships have they won?
Only 5. They won all their in the early 80's and 90's.
Was that when they had Joe Montana and Steve Young?
Yeah and don't forget Jerry Rice. He's the greatest receiver of all time!
Yeah, he was an awesome player. With those 2 quarterbacks, he was unstoppable.
I know, right?
A lot of people think the New England Patriots are up there too, but they're not.
Yeah, I'm one of them. I thought that.
They've only got 5 titles since last year.
Who has more titles than 5?
Believe it or not, the Cleveland Browns have 8 and so do the New York Giants.
Oh yeah, what about the Chicago Bears for the 80's?
Yeah, they are the second winningest team with 9 championships.
Wow, and Green Bay has 13? They are the best team.
