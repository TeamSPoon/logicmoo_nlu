Are you ready for some football? Training camp is only a month or so away.
Oh man, I'm still in baseball mode, but now that you mention it...
Next season should be pretty interesting. I still can't believe the Patriots managed to come back in the Super Bowl.
Yeah, as a Patriots hater I was shocked. There are so many things that had to happen for New England to come back.
That's their magic though, everything broke right at the end and they took advantage.
Who else do you think will be a contender this year?
I want to say the Cowboys because they caught fire last year. You never know though with young QBs.
Yeah, Prescott could take another step forward, or sometimes those guys have sophomore slumps.
I can tell you who won't be contending this year: the 49ers. I've grown up with 49ers fans, so it's kind of funny with the team being so bad.
The 49ers fans I know are pretty resigned to another bad season. How about those Raiders though?
Yeah, they were good for the first time in 15 years. Assuming Derek Carr is healthy this year, they should improve. Khalil Mack is a monster on defense.
I'm hoping they can do something memorable before moving to Las Vegas. The Oakland fans deserve it.
The Chiefs should be good again too. They're just so balanced between offense and defense.
That's a division I'm excited to watch next year. Any players you're looking out for?
Besides the usuals, I think Leonard Fournette could be a great rookie. He's on the Jaguars, so might not get blocking though.
He seems built to be a stud in the NFL. How about Christian McCaffrey?
Yeah, it's weird, you don't see 2 running backs drafted so high very often. I think McCaffrey is maybe too slight to be an every down back, but the Panthers should be able to get him the ball where he needs it.
He's so fast. Just get him the ball in the flat and let him work his magic.
On the lighter side, the Cowboys drafted a guy named Taco.
He should be a fan favorite, I already want that jersey.
