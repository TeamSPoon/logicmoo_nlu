My favorite old school actor is Frank sinatra
I agree Frank Sinatra has it with his blue eyes
He has some serious chops
I agree he's a big swooner
Who's your second favorite old school actor
I would have to say gene kelly
Gene Kelly oozes tall dark and handsome
I'm a big fan of Adam Sandler movies. But is it just me or are his movies getting lame
Yeah Jack and Jill was super lame
The movie neighbors was super funny
Yeah that movie had me rolling on the floor laughing
Hot tub time machine was also a good comedy
I like the part where they become historical figures in the end
I am a big fan of now and then are you?
Too much of a chick flick for me
Your crazy that movie was heartfelt
Fine I will say there were some good parts
The part where they were in the graveyard was petty cool
I watched Talladega nights a few days ago
Their famous line shake and bake had me beside myself
