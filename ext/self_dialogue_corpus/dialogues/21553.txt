Are you a big fan of comic book movies?
Yea I am now.
What do you by "now"?
Well for the longest time the movie studios were in charge of plots for comic book movies.
Do you have an example?
Yes, look at the original batman movies.
The ones with Michael Keaton?
Yes, and Val Kilmer, and George Clooney.
What about them?
You didn't think they were ridiculously focused on entertaining children?
Not sure what you mean.
The Penguin had an arctic cave with skating penguins.
Yea that's pretty funny and not something a real-life villain would have.
Exactly, now that the comic book companies are developing the movies themselves things are much better.
So you like the Dark Knight Trilogy?
I feel like it was one of the biggest reasons, if not the biggest reason, comic book movies are so big.
Yea it was definitely a game changer.
It was so dark and brooding, and it had such a gritty vibe to it.
They did the villains very well, Bane was very well portrayed.
Yes, Tom Hardy did a great job in that movie.
