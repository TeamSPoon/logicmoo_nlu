Do you enjoy older comedy movies?
Yes, I do very much.
Well then, which one stands out to you the most?
Probably Caddyshack. I thought it was great.
Isn't Chevy Chase in that movie?
Yes! He is hilarious in it!
Haha, I know. I love him in National Lampoons Vegas Vacation.
He is funny in all those Vacation movies.
Hell yeah he is. Have you seen Christmas Vacation?
No, but I heard it was really funny. I'm actually probably going to watch it soon now that you mentioned it.
