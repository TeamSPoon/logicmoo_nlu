Did you like Frozen?
I did the first time I watched it...
But you don't like it anymore?
Not since I've heard Let It Go at every single birthday party I've been to.
Oh, me too. I still love that song though!
Ugh, I am so tired of it. I hope the songs in Frozen 2 are less catchy.
I bet they'll be even more popular than Let It Go.
Impossible! Every kid on earth knows that song.
I just hope they get Idina Menzel to sing it again.
True. She's the only good thing about that song.
