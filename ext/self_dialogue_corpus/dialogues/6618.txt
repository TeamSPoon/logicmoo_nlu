What is your favorite Disney movie?
Good question- there are so many!  I think it is either Inside Out or Up.
Oh, I loved Up so much.  It was so funny but sweet, too.
I think I cried a little at the beginning!   Have you seen Inside Out?
No, but I want to.  It looks great.
It is cute and would be great for someone who teaches kids about feelings.
Oh, I will definitely look into that.  I bet a lot of my kids have seen it already.
Yeah, you could use the dolls or movie clips or something!
That's a great idea.  I will go see if it is on Netflix.
Great.  Let me know if you like it as much as I do!
