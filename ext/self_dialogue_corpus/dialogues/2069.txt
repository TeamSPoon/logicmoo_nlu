did you ever hear about the deflating scandal?
no? what is it?
the deflating scandal, where they were caught deflating their footballs.
no, which team was it?
i believe it was the patriots.
of course, one of biggest teams in the NFL.
yep, it was a huge thing years ago.
how did the NFL catch onto them?
probably heard a conversation about it or something.
yeah, and someone ratted the team out.
or, an NFL official could've just noticed a deflated ball and their possession.
true, and then decided to persue it.
i can't believe they were dumb enough to try and get away with it.
well what are the advantages to deflating balls?
i'm no expert but it's probably easier to play with them.
really? i would imagine it would be harder.
well i'm assuming if they are different than official weighted balls the other teams would'nt be able to handle them properly.
i guess that makes sense, well what happened to the team?
i think they were banned from a whole season.
serves them right.
