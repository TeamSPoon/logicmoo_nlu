Do you like Nicki Minaj?
She is a rapper right?
Yes, she's a rapper but also considered POP.
Yes, I think she is very creative.
Have you heard any of her new music?
Not yet, does she have a new song out?
I'm not sure, but I know she has some collaborations.
Who else does she collaborate with?
I know she has songs out with Drake, Gucci man, and Bruno Mars.
Wow, those are some big names.
Did you hear about her recent rap beef with Remi Ma?
No, what happened?
I'm not sure who started it, but I think Remi Ma called Nikki out.
That is funny.
I thought the rap beef was over, but at the BET awards it started again.
Oh, man I missed that one.
It's crazy because Remi Ma won the award!
She must've deserved it then.
I don't think Nicki agrees!
Me neither.
