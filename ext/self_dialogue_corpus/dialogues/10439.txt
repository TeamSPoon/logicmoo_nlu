Hey, what are you doing after work?
I'm probably just going to watch tv. Why?
I got these tickets to see Batman vs Superman. Wanna go with me?
Oh yes! I have been dying to see it. I'll call you after work.
Movies are half off this weekend! Any ideas of what you wanna see?
I heard Captain America Civil War is really good. How about that one?
Yeah, I haven't see that yet. I'm totally down for it.
ugh, I can't decide what to watch tomorrow! There are so many good movies right now.
Deadpool is super funny. Have you seen it yet? They picked the perfect actor for the role.
hm, nope. Wanna go see it with me?
Sure, how about we go at 3? We can grab dinner afterwards!
The new Doctor Strange is finally play in theaters. I really wanna see it!
They made a Doctor Strange movie?
Yes! I've been waiting almost a year for this movie.
Wow, that sounds awesome! Have fun at the movies and tell me all about it!
Hey I'm thinking about going to the movies for date night next week.
The movies? Well, what kind of movie do you want to see?
I'm not sure, I'm kind of interested in how the new Ghostbusters movie is.
The remake with the females? I heard the original ghostbusters have cameos in that movie!
Oh wow, really? Let's go next week then!
