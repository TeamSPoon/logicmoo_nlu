Have you seen any good movies recently?
I just watched a movie called "12 Feet Deep" last night. It was a trhiller about girls trapped in a swimming pool.
Wow that sounds like an interesting movie topic. I don't think I've ever heard of a movie quite like that.
I was more unique than many movies. It still wasn't all that exciting though.
Why not? Was it a run of the mill thriller movie.
Yeah, something like that. The villian in it was kind of pointless and I just couldn't really connect with any of the characters.
Oh, I understand. I'm looking forward to the new "Jumanji" movie I loved the first one when I was a kid.
Yeah, I heard about it. Too bad we have to wait until December for it.
It's supposed to be a sequel to the old movie but involving a computer game rather than a board game.
I wonder how they're going to be able to connect a board game with a computer game. I hope it doesn't involve some sort of future aliens.
Future aliens would be lame. Though Dwayne Johnson is starring in it and many of his movies have been lame.
That's true. I hope this movie turns out decently.
Me too. I know I'll wind up seeing it either way.
Have you read the book "Ready Player One?" That's being turned into a movie as well. It's coming out in March.
I read the book and really enjoyed it. I was wondering if there were any plans on making it into a movie.
I don't know much at all about this movie just that it's directed by Steven Spielberg and scored by John Williams.
I love those two guys. It sounds like it'll be a good movie no matter what they come up with.
I sure hope so. I want it to be fairly straightforward like the book was. No some sort of meta movie that I can never get into.
I agree, I don't like those thinking movies too much.
Well I guess only time will tell what they'll come up with. They have more than half a year to perfect it!
