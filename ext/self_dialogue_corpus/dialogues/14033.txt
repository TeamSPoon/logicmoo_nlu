Did you ever see Lady Gaga at the Supoerbowl at haltime?
No, I did not get to see it.
Yeah, she was phenomenal.
What is your favor song of hers?
I like Just Dance quite a bit, it's great for dancing.
Yes, it really is. Her songs are so strong.
Are you going to her concert soon?
Maybe we should go together?
Sure, what time do you want me to pick you up?
How about that Saturday at 5pm?
