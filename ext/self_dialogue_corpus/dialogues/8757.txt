I can't wait to hear the next Bastille album.
I love that group! Pompeii was such a great song.
My favorite part of that track is the drum part and the backing vocals.
It was such a huge hit! I still hear it all of the time.
Do they have any other big hits?
The song "Flaws" did very well at radio for them.
I'm glad to hear they had success with more than one track.
They're a talented group. The lead singer is a great musician especially.
What is his name?
His name is Dan Smith.
