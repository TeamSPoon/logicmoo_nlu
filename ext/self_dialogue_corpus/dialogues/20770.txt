What did you think of the Wizard of Oz?
Oh my gosh, I have seen that at least 200 times.
Yes me too. Judy Garland had some voice.
Who was your favorite character?
I think I liked the scarecrow the best, he was sweet.
Yea he was played by Ray Bolger.
He was born January 10th , 1904.
How do you know that?
He was born on the same date as my daughter, different years of course.
They were all good. I think I liked the Lion the least. I do not know why.
Yea. Margaret Hamilton was a great witch.
She was, her laugh or cackle was fantastic.
That movie sure is a classic!
My grandkids watch it all the time.
It is a timeless movie.
It is. No matter what year it is or what your age is, it never ceases to amaze.
I know. You know who was cute?
Those munchkins. They were adorable.
I think some are still alive still.
I think they are too.
