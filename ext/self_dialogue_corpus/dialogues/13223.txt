Hey, what's you favorite Star Wars scene?
Well. mine would have to be the fight over the Sarlacc pit in Return of the Jedi.
Okay, that's a good one, my favorite part is is when R2 zapps Salacious Crumb.
Yeah, because he was eating 3PO's eyes.
And my next favorite part is when Han Solo accidently activated Boba Fett's jetpack.
Yeah, and he falls into the Sarlacc Pit and it belches after it swallows him.
But of course, we can't forget Princess Leia and the golden bikini.
Of course not, that's the ultimate in nerd fan service.
Though, Carrie FIsher managed to make the look kind of tough, when she strangles Jabba.
Yep, old Jabba should have kept a closer eye on her.
