Hi there.
Hello.
You like the NFL?
Yeah sure do.  You?
Yep.
Do you play fantasy football?
Yeah I love it.
Same here.
It's pretty addicting isn't it?
Yeah absolutely.  I get a little obsessed.
I have to limit myself to just being in two leagues?
Only two?
Yep, how many are you in?
I'm in 4 and sometimes 5.
Man that must get confusing.
How do you mean?
Like which team to go for or which player?
Oh yeah.  That is a problem sometimes.
Well good luck this season.
You too.
