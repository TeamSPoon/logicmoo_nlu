Do you like classic movies?
I love old westerns and black and white movies, what do you like?
I really enjoy old Hitchcock movies, have you seen "North By Northwest"?
Yes, I really like Cary Grant, he is a great actor.
He was great in "Charade".
Is that the one with Audrey Hepburn?
Yes, shes great in it.
I like her in "Roman Holiday".
Don't forget "Breakfast at Tiffany's".
I like that movie, but I prefer old Hitchcock stuff, like "The Birds".
"The Birds" had a much deeper meaning then I think people realize.
I heard its really about the end of the world.
Yes, that is what I read as well, "Psycho" is my favorite.
I wish they had done a part two, maybe he escapes or something.
That was a great movie, really did a lot for movies.
Many movies copied what they did, it was a great twist ending.
Thrillers have not been the same since.
Nope, Hitchcock really outdid himself.
He did dozens of movies, I love that he had a small part in all of them.
Yes, I always try to spot him in his movies.
