Hey, have you heard of nu metal?
No.  What's that and how's it different from other metal?
Well, essentially its metal, but the bands will often include elements from other genres of music.
Could you elaborate on that?
For example, a band might play typical instruments and have a hip hop style disc jockey.
That sounds interesting.  Can you give me an example?
I think the Deftones are considered nu metal.  Have you heard of them?
Actually, yes, I have heard of them.  I have their album Around the Fur.
I have that album too.  What's your favorite song?
The album's title song is probably the best.
My favorite song is Battle-Axe, but it's on a different album.
Which album?  Maybe I would like it.
It's on their self titled album, Deftones.  You probably would like it.
I think I'll actually go buy that right now.
I was thinking about shopping for new music as well, do you want to accompany me to the store?
Sure, that sounds great.  I could use some new material to listen to.
Do you have a preference on music stores?
Not really.
I know the owner of a shop downtown and he'll probably give us a small discount.
That's awesome.  Good music plus a discount, let's go!
