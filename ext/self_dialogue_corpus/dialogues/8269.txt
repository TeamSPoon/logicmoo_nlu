Let's talk about music, who is your favorite pop star?
Recently, I have been listening to a lot of lady gaga's work.
Oh, I am a big fan of Bad Romance, which is your favorite?
My favorite is just dance but I also really like Bad Romance.
Did you know that Lady Gaga took her name from the Queen song "Radio Gaga"?
No, I did not know that. I wonder if her music is also inspired by Queen.
Well she is also famous for doing covers and has done one of the Queen classic "another one bites the dust".
I think she has definently been influenced by them in the best way.
She has had a great many influences I think, based on the numerous artists she has done covers of. All of which has spilled over into her pop career.
I believe you are right, and it has certainly benefited her music.
