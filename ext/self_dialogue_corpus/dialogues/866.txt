Who is your favorite team?
I would say The Eagles.
I love the Cowboys
Then we cant be friends
Hey Dak is better than Carson!
Not true, its hard to judge after one year.
Dak had better numbers
He also had a RB who can deal, Wentz did not have nearly the weapons
What about on defense?
Tough to say
I think Fletcher Cox is a beast
I dont think so to be honest
Having buyers remorse?
I think they overpaid him
Someone would have paid him
Yeah the NFL overpays all their lineman
Except for the ones protecting the quarterback
I think corner and quarter backs should be paid the most
Well the eagles dont have a cornerback
hey either do the cowgirls!
