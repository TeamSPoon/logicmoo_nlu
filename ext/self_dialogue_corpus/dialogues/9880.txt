What do you think of Lil' Wayne?
People bash him a lot but I think he's good.
I agree. He's got some of the most clever lyrics ever.
I think a lot of people that hate on him just aren't understanding him.
Definitely. People also just don't seem to like the way his voice sounds.
I honestly prefer it to someone like Kodak Black.
Yeah, some of these new rappers are just mumbling.
I seriously can't understand what they're saying sometimes.
Neither can I. Obviously they're doing that intentionally.
True. I think it's a style choice for them.
