Are you a fan of David Lynch.
Love him. Love him so, so, so much.
I'm just getting into him and I just saw Mulholland Street.
Yes, Mulholland Drive, actually. It's a remarkable film.
I really loved it. So surreal and so eerie.
Yeah, that's David Lynch for ya.
What should I watch next?
Twin Peaks, his television show. A new season just came out!
Really, what channel is it on?
It's on Netflix.
Okay, that sounds like a huge investment of time though. I want to watch one of his movies tonight.
Do you want something really experimental or only sort of experimental?
Um, I guess sort of experimental. Give me whatever is most accessible of his.
Okay, you should watch Blue Velvet tonight.
Blue Velvet, huh? Anyone I might know who's in it?
Yeah, Laura Dern, Dennis Hopper, Isabella Rossellini, Kyle MacLachlan.
Oh, I know Dennis Hopper and Laura Dern. What do the critics make of it?
It's a really contentious one. Love/hate relationship, I know Ebert was one of the major dissenters who thought the film sucked.
Oy, I normally trust Ebert.
Same, but I think he's wrong on this one!
