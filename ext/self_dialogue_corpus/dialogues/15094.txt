They don't make comedy movies like they used to.
Sure they do.. look at Last Vegas and A Walk In The Woods
Can you name anymore?
Not at the moment but they are there.
Look at the 80s and you'll see true comedy classics.
Oh come on, most of those are just screwball comedies that you need an IQ of single digits to really understand.
Planes, Trains & Automobiles, Big Business, Three Men And A Baby are all excelent comedies just to name a few.
A typical road trip comedy where an uptight snob changes his ways by the end of the movie.  That's hardly a classic.
That's better than movies that think being gross and disgusting qualifies as good comedy fun.
Everyone's a critic.
