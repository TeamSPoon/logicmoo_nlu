What was your favorite part about Princess and the Frog?
The part where it ended.
Oh my, you didnt like it?
No it felt forced.
In what manner?
Some of the songs did not sound right.
Do you think they rushed it?
No I just dont think they cared much for it.
I dont agree with that.
Why not? They were pusing a left wing agenda.
