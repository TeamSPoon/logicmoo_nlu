Have you heard the new Drake album?
More Life. Is that what it's called?
Yes. It's pretty good.
I'm not a huge fan of Drake.
Some people aren't. It's funny he was Lil Wayne's protege.
Right? That video was pretty funny.
The dark one in the forest? Yeah that was bad
Jeff Tweedy has a new record out this year as well.
That's not really my pace. I listen to mostly hip hop.
Any new recommendations?
Kendrick Lamar's new album Damn is spectacular.
I loved good kid maad city .
Stormzy is another good one you should check out?
Is he like Kendrick.
Not really. There is an artist named Anderson Paak who sounds like Kendrick though.
Is he as socially aware.
No. he mostly raps about parties.
Well that can be interesting to I guess
Yeah, he's a good piano player too.
I always appreciate that.
