So what do you like to do for fun?
I love to hit the open road and travel whenever I get the chance.
I bet that is a peaceful experience to say the least.
Nothing beats rolling the windows down and blasting your favorite music as loud as you want.
I can only imagine! What is the best type of music to listen to as you travel?
Well everyone is different, but for me it is rock and roll.
I think that would probably be my choice as well.
I grew up listening to AC/DC and Van Halen a lot. So that type of music is soothing for me.
I love Van Halen myself, do you have a favorite song by them?
I love their songs Jump, and Why Can't This Be Love the most.
Why Can't This Be Love is an amazing song. I have not listened to Jump however.
You should give it a listen, it is a great song in its own right.
Have you ever heard that song Eruption?
Yes! I have listened to that one many times on the open road.
I figured as much! Which AC/DC songs do you listen to the most?
I have probably listened to ever song they have ever come out with multiple times.
Wow, you must be a really big fan!
I sure am. I would say T.N.T, Hells Bells, and Shoot To Thrill are three of my favorites.
I can see how those songs would be perfect for the open road.
I enjoy them anywhere, but there is something special about listening to them on the open highway.
