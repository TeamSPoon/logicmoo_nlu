I love Chance the rapper
I agree he's great
Do you think he's pop music though?
Yes. Same drugs is a great pop song
It really is. Plus he's really popular.
What other pop songs do you like?
Anything by Ed Sheerhan.
Eh, I don't really like him
Shape of you is a great song.
I guess. I like Harry Styles more.
