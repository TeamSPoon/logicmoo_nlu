Do you like Star Wars?
Yes, but I don't like the prequals
They were not as good as the original
George Lucas made them the way he wanted
Yeah, but they weren't as epic
They certainly weren't a new concept
People came in expecting so much
I am looking forward to the Last Jedi
Luke didn't get any lines in the last one!
I hope he is in this one more.
