Have you ever heard of Lady Gaga?
No, I'm not familiar with a lot of music out today.
Really?
Yeah, I like stuff from the 80s.
Well, it's funny you say that, I feel like Lady Gaga is kind of an 80s throwback.  You should check her out.
Oh really?  Who is she most like?
Think female David Bowie.
That's interesting!  Bowie was a legend.  I might have to check her out.
You really should, she's amazing!
I'll give her a listen when I get home.
