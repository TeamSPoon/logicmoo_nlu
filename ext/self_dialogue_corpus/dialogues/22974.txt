Frozen was a real block buster wasn't it.
Yea, Even though it was for kids , I was glued to my seat in the theater.
Me too. It had such a great story line.
Yes, Elsa with her powers of freezing everything.
And Anna who just wanted to spend time with her.
Remember when Anna and Sven took off to find Elsa?
That was quite an adventure.
That is where they met Olaf.
He is one adorable snowman.
The songs were great too.
Yes , everyone was singing that Frozen song.
They sure were and all the little girls wanted to be Elsa.
Some wanted to be Anna.
I loved the story plot.
It was amazing how popular that movie became.
That is because it was so good.
It sure was.
But I did get tierd of watching it over and over and over again.
Oh me too.
I think y grandkids watched it about 500 times, seriously.
