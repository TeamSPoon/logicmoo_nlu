Did you hear that The Lion King is playing in theaters for it's 20th anniversary?
No, but that's sounds really cool! I loved The Lion King.
Me too. When Simba meets Timon and Pumba is probably my most favorite part of the movie.
Yeah. Hakuna Matata!
And then I'll never forget the sad part when Scar says to Mufasa, "Long live the king."
Of course, who could forget that?
It's a masterpiece. I'm going to go see it next week.
Yeah, I think I'll go see it, too.
Do you want to go together?
Yeah, absolutely. Hakuna Matata!
