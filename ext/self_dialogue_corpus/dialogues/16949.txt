Who is the best female artist of the 80's?
That's an easy one: Madonna.
Not Madonna. Sure she was popular, but I wouldn't call her the best female artist of the 80's.
Why not? She was a trend setter. She was like nothing that had ever come before her.
Well, that's debatable. There was Joan Jett and the Blackhearts, and the Runaways...
But they didn't have near the popularity as Madonna, or the impact on pop culture.
Look, if you want to seriously discuss the best female artist of the 80's, then it has to be Tina Turner.
Didn't she do the soundtrack for a Mad Max movie?
Yes, but she did a lot before that.
I think that might disqualify her right there.
Not a chance. Think about it. She sang Proud Mary.
You mean Rolling on the River?
Yes, that's the one.
Ok, that rocked. She is amazing when she performed that.
Nobody is in her class.
I don't know about that. What about Cyndi Lauper?
No way. She Bop and True Colors doesn't make you the best of the 80's.
Then what about Whitney Houston?
Well, ok, that's a little different. She had quite a few hits.
She isn't Tina Turner, but she rocked in the 80s.
