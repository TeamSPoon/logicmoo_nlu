Snape was the best character by far in Harry Potter.
I would say Dumbledore.
What are you talking about?  Snape was the most conflicted and had the best backstory.
But so did Dumbledore.  Like Snape, he grew up under harsh conditions.
It helped that Alan Rickman was just that good as Snape.
I have to give him credit, he was awesome in every movie.
Snape also had all the best lines.
Well, not necessarily.  Dumbledore had some catchy ones as well.
I still cry when Snape says 'Always.'
Yeah, that was heartbreaking.
