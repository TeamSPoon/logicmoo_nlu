Did you hear that Toles is out for the Dodgers.
Yeah, I heard he tore his ACL.
It looks like Cody Bellinger will get more playing time.
Is he any good?
He's been mashing so far since he was called up last month.
How's his D?
Not sure. He was mostly a first baseman in the minors, but the Dodgers are using him in the outfield.
That doesn't always work out too well.
Nah, he'll figure it out. He's still young. I'm not too concerned.
Yeah, maybe. What about Yasiel? He got off to a hot start, now he sucks again.
I know. I can't figure that guy out.
Maybe they should trade him.
His trade value is pretty low right now. I'd stick with him for now.
Would be nice if we could get something for him. We need a second baseman.
We get Forsythe back soon.
He's not that good!
He can play man! He's a great defender.
Overrated. Check out his UZR.
Man, I don't trust the metrics.
I'm telling you, he's totally overrated. We need Cano!
