Have you seen any Japanese movies before?
Not really, what kinds of movies are there?
Well there are all kinds really, but I like the animated ones in particular.
Which one is your favorite?
I really liked Spirited Away, that was a good one.
What was that movie about?
It was a very interesting movie about a girl getting trapped in a spirit world.
Oh, that's very different.
Yeah, the whole movie had lots of interesting ideas and scenery.
Like what?
Her parents get turned into pigs and she ends up working at a resort filled with monsters.
That is interesting. What are the monsters like?
There are lots of frog-looking people, but also big gross ones that eat everything.
Eww, that's nasty.
Yeah he's a pretty interesting character though, he's a metaphor I think.
A metaphor for what?
It could be the girl's feeling of not belonging where she is, or some kind of sadness.
That's pretty deep, is the whole movie like that.
Pretty much, even though it seems like a kid's movie there's a lot of adult themes in it.
Very cool, I'll have to look it up online sometime.
