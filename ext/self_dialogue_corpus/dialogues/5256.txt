Bambi was such a good movie, it was really sad though
I know , I hated it when the forest caught on fire
the part when his mother was shot was horrible, I am glad he found friends
Thumper was my favorite, he was so cute! I liked his mom also
the graphics were older but they were so pretty , it is a classic.
It really is, I do not own many movies but I do own this one.
I am glad that Bambi grew up and was such a strong deer
I know, he had a good life. This movie always makes me cry
He was a cute little deer though, with his spots!
I know, baby deer always have spots, I did not know this until I watched this movie when I was a kid.
