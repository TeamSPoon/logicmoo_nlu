So I've only just found out that there were Pongo and Perdy only had like 20 dalmations in "101 Dalmations".
Yeah, so what?
Well, firstly why's it called "101 Dalmations" and secondly how is Cruella de Vil supposed to make a coat out of them.
Firstly, they meet 80 more Dalmations when Cruella kidnaps them hence the coat.
Oh, that makes sense.
Wait have you not seen it?
No, never got round to it.
Really, you're missing out on one of the all-time classics.
OK, well should we watch it this weekend.
Sorry no can do, making a Dalmation-skinned coat.
