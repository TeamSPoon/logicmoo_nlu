So will you be watching any NFL games this year?
I don't know.  I used to love the Patriots...
You don't anymore?
Not really.  That's why I don't think I'll follow the season.
What happened?
The whole "deflategate" thing turned me off.
Why so?  I don't think it was that big of a deal.
Well, I lost faith in Tom Brady and he was my favorite player.
I really don't think he did anything wrong.
Do you think he should have turned over his cell phone?
Not personally, no.  Do you?
I don't know.  It really bothered me at the time.
I don't think they cheated.  Even if they did, it wasn't that bad.
I'm just not sure I agree.
What was so horrible about it?
Just the fact that they might have cheated.  It made me feel like a fool for following them for so long.
You felt duped?
Yes, definitely.  I just don't think I'll ever have that passion for them again.
Well, I see your point of view but perhaps you can get past it?
I doubt it but I appreciate your optimism!
