I really hope M.I.A. doesn't retire.
Didn't she just drop an album?
She did, but she's been hinting that it might be her last.
Oh, no! I really like AIM.
I liked AIM a lot too, and Matangi. But I tihnk she's having label troubles.
I've been hearing that about her for a while.
Do you think it's the end for her?
No, I don't. I can see her dropping a new mixtape.
She's just too good to disappear.
There really isn't any other rapper out there like her.
