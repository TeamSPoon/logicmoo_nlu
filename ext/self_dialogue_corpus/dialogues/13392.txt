What do you think about the new Story episode.
I actually really liked it.  It was better than I was expecting.
I loved K2SO.  I thought he was great!
He had the most memorable lines in the movie.
He was funnier than C3P0 but still had that robotness about him.
I liked Jyn as well.  I have liked the new female leads that have been in the new movies.
In a weird way I liked the fact that all of them died at the end.  The good guys don't always have to survive.
I knew that's what was going to happen since none of those characters are in episode 4.
They threw in some connections to episode 4 like when they bumped into the ugly guys from the cantina.
I thought the overall connection between episode 3 and 4 was done pretty well.  Though CGI Leia was a little weird at the end.
