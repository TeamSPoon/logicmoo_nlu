The next NFL football season is coming up; what did you think of last season?
I thought that there were some nice surprises. What did you think of the NFC champonship game?
Boy, looked like the Falcons had no competition and ran with the game.
Yeah, those Packers just threw away a possible miracle comeback on two occasions.
How did you like the playoff situation for the NFC South?
I was hoping that the Tampa Bay Buccaneers would have made it in.
Oh, you like the Buccaneers?
Oh, yes, been a fan since 1998.
For real? Why the Buccaneers?
Oh, they once had a spectacular defense and they appeared to be collecting themselves last season.
Oh...ok? The Buccaneers had a good defense?
Oh sure. I may be a little ancient with my statement.
Yeah, I can't remember Tampa Bay ever being a good team.
Well, they earned my respect during the 1999 NFC championship.
Really, how so?
Well, I can remember transferring from a college in Lakeland, FL to a college in St. Louis that year.
Right, didn't the NFC championship have the Rams and Buccaneers facing each other?
Yes, and I'd just started attending a school in St. Louis. There were lots of mouthy St. Louis fans.
Sure, I can imagine; sorry for the disruption, but, the Buccaneers actually earned your respect than?
Yes, believe it or not, word went around that students would get an individual pizza for every touchdown that the Rams beat the Buccaneers by. I was nervously watching the championship game. One the first play, the Buccaneers got an interception. I was so happy that I fell asleep until some point in the 3rd quarter. I can remember that the Buccaneers had shut the Rams down and were up 6 to 0. The stadium was a eco silence with disappointed Rams fans. That stadium silence is what than fill me with respect for the Buccaneers. After the game, even though the Buccaneers lost, there were no pizzas to give.
