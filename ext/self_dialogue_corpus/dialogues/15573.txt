Elvis Presley, yes or no?
Yes. Absolutely yes.
Yeah, I guess I would have to agree.
He basically invented rock and roll.
Well, I don't know if I would go that far.
Well he definitely put it in a new category.
Yeah I guess that's why they call him the King
What's your favorite Elvis song?
I really like Jailhouse Rock
yeah, that one is a classic
What about you, what's your favorite
I really like Can't Help Falling in Love
Ah right. Classic from Blue Hawaii
Yes, I believe you are correct
Ever been to Graceland?
No, but I want to go some day.
I hear it's pretty interesting, but expensive
Yeah, that's what I heard as well.
Well anyway, long live the King of Rock and Roll.
Yes indeed
