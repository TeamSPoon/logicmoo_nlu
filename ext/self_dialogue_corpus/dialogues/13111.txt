So, in Episode one of Star Wars, they said Anakin does not have a dad right.
Yes, that the force made him, with his mom.
So, he is more than half metaclhorins?
Yep, weird but yes.
And, they still had to question if he was the chosen one?
I always thought that part was odd.
Would they not have been a bit afraid of him?
I would think it was odd, him being so powerful.
I think that is why he went bad.
Why, due to people fearing him?
