Do you think music classes are important when your young?
Depends on what your after.
Like if you want to pursue a music career.
That's an interesting question. I think it's a mixture of nature and nuture.
What do you mean?
Well, I know many people are born with perfect pitch, and are naturally talented.
Yeah I know some people like that.
And then many people took a lot of music classes at a young age, to get a headstart.
That makes sense. Did you take music classes?
I did when I was a kid. I played piano and also took choir classes pretty seriously in elementary school.
Do you think it helped you become a better singer.
Yeah. I was definitely more aware of music growing up.
I kind of wish my parents pushed me into music when I was a kid.
You're pretty musically talented. Why do you say that?
Imagine if I got training at a young training. Like you said, a headstart
That's true. But at least you got the musical genes. You're a better singer than I am and I started early.
True that. Sorry man.
no no sorry. We're a good team.
You got that right.
Yeah!
