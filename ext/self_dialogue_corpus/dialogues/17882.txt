Did you ever hear of Allison Krauss and the Union Station Band?
No I did not.
It is a country bluegrass band, she has the voice of an angel.
Really. I do not think I have ever heard of them.
I think if you heard any of the songs you may recognize them.
Oh what did she sing??
Well she did a duet with Brad Paisley that was popular called Whiskey.
Oh yes I have heard that one! She does have a great voice!
She started playing the fiddle when she was a little girl and won lots of awards.
That's great!
Brad Paisley is really good too.
He is but I have not heard anything from him recently.
Me either. I wonder what he is up too.
He had some good songs like I, gonna Miss Her.
Oh yea that was the one about fishing.
Yea that is right.
That song was pretty funny.
It was but very true.
I know, my husband is a fisherman.
Yea mine too.
