What do you think of Elvis?
He had some jams.
I heard he use to shoot tvs in his living room when he got mad.
If I was rich and the king. I would shoot tvs, too.
Do you have a favorite Elvis song?
I really like In the Ghetto.
Wow, that's not a song a lot of people choose.
That's why I like it.  It's like a hidden gem in the Elvis collection.
It was a pretty big song wasn't it?
Yeah, but not as big as Blue Swede Shoes and some other ones.
I don't think I've heard In the Ghetto by Elvis.
It's a really good song about life in the inner city.
They do say Elvis stole 'black music' and made it his own.
That's a really big statement.  I don't think music has a color.
That's what I like about music.
To me music is just something you can enjoy.
I do enjoy Elvis.
I just wish he wouldn't have went so crazy towards the end.
It's got to be tough being that famous.
I'd like to try it.
