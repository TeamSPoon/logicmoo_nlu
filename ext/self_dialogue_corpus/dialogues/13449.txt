I wonder what it means by the last jedi
I think the jedi will try to unify themselves and not worry about light side and dark
In Rogue One there was the force user, should have been trained
There was no one to train him
It looks like Luke is in charge of them now
The Jedi don't get as much training as they used to
Maybe the Jedi and the Sith will join together to fight a common enemy
I feel like Luke will have a son or daughter, they have to continue the family theme
Who do you think the last jedi is, maybe Rey?
Maybe it just means Luke, since Rey and Finn aren't Jedi yet.
