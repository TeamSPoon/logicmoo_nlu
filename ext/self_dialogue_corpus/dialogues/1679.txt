What do think about the Raiders this year?
Oh wow, I am not sure
I think if Carr can stay healthy they have a real shot
I agree actually.
That D is just unreal
I know! Its brutally though
Speaking of tough have you seen their schedule?
I know!
And they are on TV a ton.
Really? I hadn't known that.
I think its like 4 times?
What, no way.
I think so
And of course they are moving to Las Vegas
That has nothing to do with anything.
No but it might be on their minds
I guess.
Needless to say its going to be a great year I hope.
Raider nation back!
I sure hope so
