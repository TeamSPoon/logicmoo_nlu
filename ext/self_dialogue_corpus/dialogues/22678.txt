Wanna watch a movie tonight?
Yeah, what'd you have in mind?
I don't know. I was thinking about that new Tupac movie.
You mean All Eyez on Me?
Yeah.
Is it online yet?
It should be. I checked last week though and it wasn't.
I know. They trying to cut back on all the pirating I guess.
Shoot, that corny Wonder Woman was online the day after it came out.
Like you said, because it's corny.
I started to take a peek at it then I was like, hell no.
Yeah my dude. No cool points for watching Wonder Woman.
It's like the movie industry can't come up with any original ideas.
I know. They got a Baywatch movie and it's supposed to be a comedy.
With The Rock in there. That thing look lame and stupid.
Well if the 'Pac movie ain't online what are we going to watch?
Maybe we can just go to Redbox and find something.
Let me know, I really could stand to watch a good flick.
Well google some good titles and we will go together to find something.
Okay, will do.
