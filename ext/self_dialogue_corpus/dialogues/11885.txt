I love that one song that was covered the beatles originally did
What song
In my life
That is a good song
I love the cover and the original
Who covered it
Ozzy Osbourne did
oh yeah i have heard that one
It works because it sounds rockish modernly but the same as the old one too
Yeah but noone can be better than they were
