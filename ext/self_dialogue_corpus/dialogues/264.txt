Who is your favorite Spider-Man actor?
Definitely NOT Tobey. I think they keep getting better.
Why not? He's fine.
Yes, fine, and the original, but not spectacular. Plus, he was emo for a movie.
At least he played the character well.
True. My favorite would probably be Andrew Garfield. He's fantastic in everything.
What about the new guy?
I don't know anything about him, really--he was just briefly in Civil War.
Trust me, he's a great actor and perfect for the part.
I'll have to take your word for it.
