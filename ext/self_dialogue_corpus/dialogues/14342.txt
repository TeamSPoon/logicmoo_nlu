So you're a basketball fan, right?
Yup! I've been following basketball for years.
What's your favorite team?
The NY Knicks.
Have they been doing well lately?
... No. Definitely no. They've been a trainwreck.
That bad?
Unfortunately, yes.
Why have they been doing so poorly?
Mainly really, really stupid trades.
Ooh. That bad, huh.
Yup. And wasting most of their money on a well-known player who's now past his prime.
But isn't paying for well-known players pretty common?
Probably, but I think there are better team-building strategies.
What would you recommend?
Building a team of good, young players.
Why would you reccomend that?
Several reasons. They're cheaper. They can build a good camaraderie as they're all new.
Anything else?
And when they become well-known players they hopefully feel some loyalty to the Knicks!
