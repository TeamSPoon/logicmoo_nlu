Do you listen to Lady Gaga?
Not actively, but I've heard a lot of her songs.
What do you think?
I think she's ok.
I love to sing her songs, they are so fun.
Well, I will say that people always sing her songs at karaoke.
I love karaoke!
Me too, and for sure, Bad Romance is one of everyone's favorite songs to sing.
Yea I always get into that sing when I hear.
It's a pretty good song.
