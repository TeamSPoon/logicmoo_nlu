Have you heard of Danny Boyle?
The director?
Yes, the director.
Yes, I really liked Slumdog Millionaire
Yeah, that was a good one. Quite poignant
Some of those scenes in the India slums were pretty tough to watch
Yeah, but it felt authentic.
Didn't he also direct Trainspotting?
Yes, and the sequel as well
There was a sequel to Trainspotting?
Yeah, it came out fairly recently.
I thought the first one was pretty depressing. A lot of drug use.
Boyle also directed Steve Jobs
Oh really? I didn't realize he did that one as well.
Yeah, I liked that one.
I did too. It was three very different acts within a movie.
Right, felt very much like a play.
And the film used was different for each act. Meant to mimic each era of Jobs' life
Interesting. I didn't realize that.
Yeah, it was a nice attention to detail.
