What is your favorite football team.
My favorite team is the browns.
Why would you like the browns?
I was born and raised a browns fan. I am a loyal, die hard fan. I am not a front runner.
That is a good fan to be. Many fans only root for a team because they are good.
Yes. I for sure am not one of those fans.
Do you think the browns will finally improve this year?
I do like their coach and I think they should stick with him. I also think they did well in the draft but I think it will take a long time.
A lot of people think the owner doesn't know what he is doing.
I'm one of them. He has already failed once by having to start over.
Do you think he can still build a winner?
I'm not sure. He talks the talk but I'm not so sure he knows what he is doing.
What's his biggest flaw?
He's too involved. He needs to leave things up to the pros and stay out of the details.
Do you think he is better than Randy Lerner?
I'm not really sure. Randy lerner at least did everything he could to get the right people involved.
So why didn't he succeed?
I don't know. Sometimes I think this team is cursed. I thought for sure they had something going when they got Holmgren as a GM.
Nobody will ever dispute how difilcult it is to be a browns fan
That is for sure.
