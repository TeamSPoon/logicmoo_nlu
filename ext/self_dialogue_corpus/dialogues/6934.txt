I have that Christina Aguilera song stuck in my head. From that Disney film.
You mean the one that takes place in China?
Yeah, Mulan. I used to love that film.
Same, but I have to say I remember more about the soundtrack than I do about the film.
You and me both, actually. That's why that song is stuck in my head.
It's a good one, but that "Make a Man Out of You" song was the big one.
Did you know that song was actually sung by Donny Osmond?
Are you serious? That's so funny!
I know! I think I want to watch the movie again now.
You should. It's one of the last great animated films!
