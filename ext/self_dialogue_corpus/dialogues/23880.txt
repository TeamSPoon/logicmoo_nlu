Did you see Christian Bale in the Prestige?
Yes , he was great.
I agree he was great but did his character, Borden have a twin or did he clone himself?
He had a twin.
Then why did Borden send Angier to Tesla?
It was just a trick, to fool Angier.
How did Borden know Tesla had the machine to clone people?
He didn't, even Tesla wasn't sure what the machine was or how it worked.
So, it was all just a coincidence?
Yeah, it was. Borden was just trying to send Angier away to the States.
I see. I didn't think they's make storyline so ambigious.
It's not, it adds to the mystery. The whole movie is really well thought out.
It was hard to see Christian Bale cut off his own thumb.
I didn't like seeing the canary get killed.
Me neither, but it illustrates a good point about how the magic tricks work.
What do you mean?
Just like how Christian Bale cut off his thumb, it's all just an illusion.
Right, like the magician who pretended to be elderly so he could make it seem like he was levitating the fish bowl.
Exactly. It's all about appearances.
That movie was a good one.
