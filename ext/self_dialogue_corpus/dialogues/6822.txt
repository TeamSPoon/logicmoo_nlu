What is your favorite Disney movie?
I think Beauty and The Beast.
Really, that is a hard one for me to decide.
Don't you have a favorite?
I loved Alladin.
I forgot about that one. He was a street rat.
Yes and Robin Williams was a great Genie.
Even the parrot was good.
I don't know who played the parrot.
He's a comedian, I don't know his name.
