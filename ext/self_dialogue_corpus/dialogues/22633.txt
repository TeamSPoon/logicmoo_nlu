Do you like Stanley Kubrick movies?
I'm not sure if I've seen one.
Have you seen The Shining?
I indeed have.
Then you've seen a Stanley Kubrick movie.
Oh okay! That movie is great!
It really is. They do a great job of making it horror.
Yeah, Jack Nickleson is terrorfying in that movie.
I always forget Steven King wrote the book.
He did he did.
A Clockwork Orange is also another good Stanley Kubrick  movie.
I don't think I've seen that one.
It's pretty dark, but a good watch.
What's it about?
A group of teenagers in Europe who torture others.
That sounds interesting...
There's more to it but I don't want to spoil it.
Yeah I appreciate that.
Maybe we can watch it this weekend.
Sure let's plan on that!
