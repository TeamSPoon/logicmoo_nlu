Guess what I'm watching? Yes, Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter.
Wasn't the last chapter was it? It kept going past that.
it's still good for a slasher film. And Corey Feldman is in it.
Oh he was great in that movie. He should of made the next film that used Tommy.
Jason kills so many innocent victims. Why is he so unreasonable?
When you're left to drown by irresponsible teens, things go haywire. Do you blame him?
Tommy's sister is the best survivor. She screams her head off.
She's beautiful and pretty smart for a blonde. I don't think I saw her again.
I don't like when we don't witness how they die. We don't get to see how Jason gets that bike riding twin.
It was most likely a boring kill. We see the most creative damage done.
