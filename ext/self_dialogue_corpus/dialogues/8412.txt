Do you like Spanish music?
Sometimes I do.
There is this one song I like a lot.
What is it called?
Despacito by Luis Fonsi is a jam.
There is something special about Spanish songs.
Yes the language sounds great in a song.
Yes words that end with vowels are fun to listen to, they sound melodic in great songs.
Yes the language combines with the unique Spanish culture beats to create a great sound.
I want to hear this song you told me about, I am looking forward to then.
