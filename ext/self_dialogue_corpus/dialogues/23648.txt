Do you remember John Candy?
Yeah, he had some good movies in the 80s.
Do you remember Summer Rental?
Was that the one where they went on vacation?
Yeah, they rented a house on the beach.
Yes.  I loved that one.
I did too, that's probably one of my favorites of his.
I'd say mine too.
At the beginning, before they go into the crappy house, didn't they go into the wrong one?
I think so.  And the people came back home!
Yes!  I think the fun really started when they got to their real rental.
Of course.  That's what everyone remembers most.
Those people using their house to get to the beach!
Weren't they even using their bathroom?
Yes!  I think one guy was even eating a sandwich in their bed.
It had to have been a horrible vacation.
Who even has a summer long vacation?
Rich people I guess.
His family didn't seem rich.
No, but it was a good movie.
