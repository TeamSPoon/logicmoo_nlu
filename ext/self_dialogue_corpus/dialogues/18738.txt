Do you remember "Hit Me Baby One More Time"?
That song was my JAM! Oh, Britney.
Right? I think "Toxic" was my favorite, though.
Yes! Back in high school, whenever that song came on during dances everyone would race onto the dance floor.
It was pretty fun. I kinda miss bubble gum pop.
It wasn't that bad. It was offset so well by the super sad rock music that was coming out. Staind was my favorite...
Oh gees, Staind! I wonder what happened to that guy. I liked Blink 182. Their lyrics mocked Britney Spears' stuff at the time...
Like they should talk, though. I mean their stuff was sort of just as happy as Britney's.
Except for that divorce song they did.
What divorce song?
Remember? The one that was raising awareness for 'broken families'? Hold on I'm going to look it up. Oh! Stay Together For The Kids.
Hahaha. That's DEFINITELY a song about divorce, judging by the title. I think I remember it. I remember 'I Miss You.'
That was a sad song, yeah.
Remember that dramatic song with Lindsay Lohan and her family?
Rumors!?
No, no. Confessions of a Broken Heart.
Oh I remember the music video for that one. She was like... huddling in a corner of her room because her dad was scary or something?
Yeah, I can't remember if it was about actual abuse or not.
Grim. I did like Rumors, though.
Yeah, Rumors was fun.
