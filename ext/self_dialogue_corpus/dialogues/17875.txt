Did you catch that Royal Bliss concert?
They're still around?
Locally.
Why here?
They're based out of Utah.
Oh.
Yeah, they only tour in the west.
I can't even remember what they play.
Devils & Angels.
Don't remeber that one.
Cry Sister.
That one was alright.
Yeah. They have a few good ones.
Why are you such a fan.
My brother knows them.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah, his band opened for them one time they came to town.
That's pretty cool.
Yeah, apparently the really hit it off.
You should see if he'll introduce us.
