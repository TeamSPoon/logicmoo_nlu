Who's your favorite pop artist of all time?
That's easy. It's Michael Jackson.
He is the king. I can't argue with that.
He just sang in an effortless way. It was like he didn't even have to try to be great.
I agree. He could have done vocals over anything and it would have been good.
He actually used to write his own songs, too.
That's so cool. That's really rare in pop music.
What was your favorite song by him?
Mine was probably "Smooth Criminal". What was yours?
I'm going to have to go with "Beat it".
