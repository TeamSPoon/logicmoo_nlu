What do you think of the Manning brothers?
I think they are a little overrated, actually.
What? I think they are both great players.
Don't get me wrong, they are, but like I said....they aren't the best.
Yeah, I agree there are better players then them.
I can't even remember their names, Peyton and....
Eli. Eli is the younger one.
Gotcha, I feel like they've been a part of the NFL forever.
They really have, I'm surprised they haven't retired yet.
Peyton is a part of the Patriots, right?
Yep, not sure what team Eli is on though.
They probably aren't on the same team, I'm assuming?
Probably not, conflict of interest maybe.
Well, all I'm saying is I'm sure they'll retire soon.
I feel like they'll play until they can't even walk.
How many superbowls have they been both in, do you think?
Oh, too many to count.
Well I know the Patriots just were in the Superbowl.
Yeah, and lost, if I remember correctly.
You remembered correctly indeed!
