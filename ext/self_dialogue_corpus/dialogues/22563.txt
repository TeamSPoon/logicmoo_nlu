What would you say is Joss Whedon's best movie project?
We're only talking about movies here? Not TV shows?
Yep, only talking about movies.
Darn, I'd say Firefly, then Buffy the Vampire Slayer.
Yeah, that would be too easy. So it's only movies.
I'd maybe say Avengers Age of Ultron, then.
Really? I wasn't all that fond of the movie.
I thought it was an excellent example of how to make a massive superhero movie entertaining.
See, for me it was kind of bloated and overly scattered.
Bloated, I will grant, but that's how it is these days. Every movie needs to be 3 hours for some reason.
Tell me about it.
But I didn't think it was scattered. I think Whedon did a nice job of cutting in contemplative, character building moments amid the action.
Yeah, those moments didn't work for me. I found them distracting.
I feel like most superhero movies don't do enough of that.
We clearly have different taste in superhero movies, then!
I guess so. Did you like the Thor movies.
Yeah, they were a lot of fun!
There you go. I didn't like them at all.
Why not?
They were just kind of goofy and bland.
