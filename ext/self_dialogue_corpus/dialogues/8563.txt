The 2017 BET Awards are about to begin tonight. Who are you looking forward in seeing?
I like to see Beyonce. She is very talented.
I'm not sure if you heard "Sorry". Its a very good song.
I heard that one and its really good song to listen to and especially while driving.
I feel that she sounds even better on stange than on the radio.
I couldn't agree with you more.
She does have a lot of songs under her belt.
I agree. I also like the song "lemonade".
That is a very cool song.
Yes it is. Very catchy and I'm sure fans of hers would love that particular song.
