Have you ever heard of Motionless in White?
What's that, a movie?
Funny, but no. They are a band.
No, I never did.
My son is actually friends with them.
Are they popular?
Apparently, yes.
Do they sing any good songs?
They are considered a metalcore band. Some songs I heard are good.
How does your son know them?
They are actually from Pittston and Scranton.
That's cool.
We saw them last year at Warped Tour.
So they are young I guess.
In their twenties I think. Like my son.
I'll have to google them.
Devil's Night is a good song to watch the video on Youtube.
I'll look for it.
I told my son, he should have joined.
He should, he does have a good voice.
