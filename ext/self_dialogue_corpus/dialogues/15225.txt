Do you remember that one pop punk band called Sr-71?
I think so. Didn't they do that song called Right Now?
Yeah that's them. I liked that song a lot. It was very catchy.
Yeah they are pretty good except I feel like they ripped off NOFX.
Who's NOFX?
They are like this christian punk band.
I will have to check them out. Are they pretty good?
They are but they are an older band.
That's cool. How did SR-71 rip them off though?
Well if you listen to some of their songs you'll notice similarities in tunes.
Really? I never realized that.
Yeah but both bands are still good.
What about that one band New Found Glory?
What about them?
Whatever happened to that band?
Man I don't know they just stopped being popular I guess.
Weird. I liked their music a lot especially that song My Friends Over You.
Yeah that one was okay.
Some of these groups remind me though of when Simple Plan was all popular.
Oh yeah I remember that Emo Pop Punk band.
