I wonder when the next Madonna album will come out.
I haven't heard any news about her being in the studio with anyone, so it is likely not anytime soon.
Well, a lot of artists have managed to pull off surprise records lately, so she could be doing that.
I suppose. I haven't really liked her last couple albums anyway though.
I thought they were pretty good. Rebel Heart especially had some great tracks on it.
It had some pretty bad ones as well.
It could have probably been trimmed down a bit.
Her recent output often feels a little too much like she is chasing trends though, rather than setting them like she used to.
I suppose I can see that. She still writes some really solid pop songs though.
True, but I would really like to see her properly return to form and put out a 100% solid album.
When do you think was the last time she did that?
I would say the last one that was all great was Confessions on a Dancefloor.
Yeah, that was a great album.
Catchy melodies, and production that was a perfect blend of where pop and dance were heading and where they had come from.
I have to agree there.
But following that up with Hard Candy was a mistake.
I liked some of that.
But you didn't like all of it.
No, I suppose not.
And there you go. All of her output from then on has been like that.
