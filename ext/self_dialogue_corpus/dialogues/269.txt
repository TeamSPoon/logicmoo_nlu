Did you see the new wonder woman?
Just last night! Amazing!
I really enjoyed it. Gal Godot is so beautiful.
Ya no kidding, she was a model prior.
I heard she was pregnant while filming.
Incredible, truly a wonder woman.
The updated costume was so flattering.
Ya, I think a lot of girls will be her for halloween this year.
Probably, made me want to wear that outfit.
Don't forget your tiara and lasso.
