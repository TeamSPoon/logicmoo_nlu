Who is your favorite metal band?
I love Five Finger Death Punch!
Me too! what is your favorite song?
I like their version of bad company.
I heard that one, its good.
What do you think of that song " Wrong side of Heaven, Rightious Side Of Hell?"
I like it as far as their ballad moments go, a very visual song.
What do you mean?
Well alot of their songs deal with soliders, and I can see that, but it applies to others as well.
I can see that. It always puts me in mind of a biker gang brawler.
Really? how so?
Biker clubs around here are known to listen to hard rock music, and I can visualize someone trying to do good but that is no angel.
You mean, like raising money for school kids, but still in the biker life?
yes exactly
Their song no one left behind does the same thing for me
What image does it invoke there?
We used to work out to that song.
Who were you listening to that music with while working out?
My marine buddies and I listen to them all the time to get pumped up.
Yes, I can imagine that, their music does have a good beat.
