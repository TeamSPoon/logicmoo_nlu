Who are some of your favorite bands of all time?
I really like White Zombie and Rage Against the Machine.
Rage Against the Machine, I haven't listened to them in awhile. What's your favorite album of theirs?
It's tough to choose. I love their self-titled album, I love Battle of Los Angeles, and Evil Empire is great too.
What about Renegades? It's cover songs, but I really enjoyed it.
Yes that's a good one too. Songs off of Renegades helped me get into them and seek out more of their stuff.
I like them a lot too. I think each album has a different personality and there are different things to like about them.
Yes, I would listen to different albums of theirs depending on my mood.
The self-titled first album is really angry and hard charging.
It's like a shot of adrenaline and it doesn't let go. The song "Wake Up" I used to listen to on my way to work if I had a long day ahead of me.
And of course it has the infamous "Killing in the Name."
I remember hearing that on the radio and they edited out the last several lines because of the expletive that was repeated.
The songs are very political too, like "Killing in the Name," "Bombtrack," and "Take the Power Back."
You could consider just about all the songs on this album as political. It really established their tone and attitude.
What else stands out about the album?
Tom Morello's guitar playing is amazing as is Zach de la Rocha's vocal work.
What did you think about the cover?
The picture of the monk immolating himself, yes it was and still is very controversial. I think it made a powerful statement.
Do you like the way they combined rap and metal?
I think it's great because they figured out how to pull it off and make it work. Too many imitators have fallen short in trying to replicate the sound.
