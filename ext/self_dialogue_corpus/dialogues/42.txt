Do you consider Deadpool to be a superhero?
I had never even thought about it.
I mean, the X-men are always trying to recruit him.
But he is sort of an anti-hero.
Yes, but there are superheroes that help him. It is a super hero film.
He is a hero, and super I guess.
He is. And, he is associated with Wolverine, a super hero.
Wolverine is kind of an anti hero as well though.
Yes, but he always ends up helping to save the day.
I think then, Deadpool is a super hero.
