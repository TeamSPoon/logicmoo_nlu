Have you seen the movie They're Watching?
I think so, is that the movie with Brigid Brannagh?
Yes, I really enjoyed it. I thought they did a good job creating a creepy element with the town and townspeople.
Agreed, the scene with all of the townspeople gathered outside of Becky's house was very creepy.
It was! I thought the ending was interesting too.
Agreed, you pretty much expected Becky to be the witch though.
True, but they did it in a unique enough way that you don't mind how predictable it was. The effects were well done too.
They sure were! The magic at the end was really good, and the parts where they found Kate and Vladimir were very well done.
They were, though those scenes were a bit gory for my taste.
That's understandable, but they certainly made an impact!
