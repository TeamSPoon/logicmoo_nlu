It is strange to me how disney can make some great films and then such awful ones.
What awful ones?
Are you kidding me ? There is a long list of awful disney films.
Such as  what? I want names.
Well to name a few Mc farland,USA. , Teen beach movie, Bad hair day. The list can go on and on.
Well I will say not all there movies are top quality.
Exactly I just find it weird that they can vary so much in the quality of film they make.
Isn't that true of any studio, they have some hits some misses?
Perhaps, I just find it baffling to go from oscar worthy films to teen beach movie 2.
Well I suppose they are trying to make as much money as possible.
