Who is the scariest person in Star Wars?
That's such a tough question!
Just pick one person that makes your skin crawl because they are so evil
I would say the scariest person would actually be Anakin as he is burning
Why do you say that?
His eyes are so full of hate and he screams so much
Well he is burning! Of course he is screaming
But besides that, he screams "I Hate You" to the Jedi as he burns
Wasn't he yelling at Obi Wan?
Yeah, Obi Wan didnt help him as he burned
