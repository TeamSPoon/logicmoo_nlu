What is your most anticipated movie release?
I think it would have to be Coco by Disney.
Oh, I haven't heard about that movie, what is about?
It's a story of a young Mexican boy on the day of the dead or something like that.
That seems interesting, it's an animated one right?
Yeah, and as always the animation looks amazing and so well produced.
I might give it a chance, what is the premier date?
On August I believe, I'm planning on going with my whole family.
That sounds cool, let me know how well you liked it.
I sure will, I hope you go to watch it too.
