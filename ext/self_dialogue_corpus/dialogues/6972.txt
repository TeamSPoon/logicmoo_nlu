What do you think about Mufassa's death?
I think he should have seen it coming
It was the climax of the movie
It seems like, being a King, he would have been able to call for more help to save his son
I think the scene had a plot hole
How is that?
Scar's plan worked perfectly. The right person died
Maybe Scar just wanted the stampede to kill Mufassa
Scar was a very unlikable villain
He should have started his own pride
