Who was your favorite batman?
Adam west because he was the original.
I always found those west batman movies cheesy.
They were but that was part of the charm.
I do think they have the most kitch, like a comic may have.
Yes, they are more lighthearted than the newer versions.
So sad adam west died.
Yes, I heard it is sad.
He has a good legacy though.
Yes he is very iconic and who would not want to have been batman.
