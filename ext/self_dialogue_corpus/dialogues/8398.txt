Do you remember the very first concert you went to?
Oh yes!  I went to see the GoGos perform at a small college in Illinois. I think I was about 18 at the time?
I like some of their songs and videos Were they good in concert?
Yeah, they were pretty good.  My friends and I had a really good time.  What about you?  What was your first concert?
I got to see Paul Young perform at Duke University.  He and his band put on an awesome show.
Paul Young?  I think I remember him.  He sang "Every Time You Go Away", right?
Yes, that's one of his hits.  Do you remember "Band-Aid"?  He was the very first singer.
I do remember that.  So, was his show your favorite concert?
No, it was really good but, not my favorite.  My favorite was seeing Yes at the Dean Dome in Chapel Hill.  They were fanatastic.
I like their music but, have never seen them in concert.
