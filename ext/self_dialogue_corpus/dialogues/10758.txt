What do you think was the best set-piece of the whole Fast & Furious franchise?
They keep ramping up the action and topping themselves each movie.  I need a moment to think about this.
I think mine was the scene in Fast 7 when the crew drives their cars out of the plane and parachute down.
That was a pretty epic scene.  I read that a lot of the car sequences once they hit ground were practical effects, and not CGI.
They actually threw a car out of a real plane too!
No way.  Really?
Yes.  There is a behind the scenes video where it is explained and shown.
That gives me new appreciation for the series.
There were camera men jumping with the cars and everything.  I hope they continue to do this.
I don't think there is any slowing down of this franchise in the near future.
