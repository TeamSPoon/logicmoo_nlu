do you like hip hop music?
oh yeah, I listen to them in my car all day
turn your bass all the way up, right?
exactly.
do you download those music or stream them?
I found it extremely convenient to listen to them on Spotify, it also gives me new artists recommendation everyday
that should keep you refreshed
for sure, I followed a station, and it gives me the hottest songs everyday, like today I saw Drake's Signs' coming to the top
oh Drake, I remember he made a very weird music video, where he danced in a lightinig box
haha, that created a huge internet sensation, a lot of memes were invented after that
