Who do you think has the best stadium in the NFL?
Without a doubt, it's the Cowboys. The billion dollar playground.
Jerry Jones really loves to be a showoff. That stadium is insane.
The technology, design, and experience is bar none.
I bet. I would agree that the Cowboys have the best stadium. What other stadiums stand out?
I would have to say that Seattle's stadium is pretty spectacular as well.
Architecturally, it is a pretty stadium.
They did a good job with that stadium, especially making it unique.
It is definitely unique. What about the older stadiums like Soldier Field or Lambeau Field?
Those are great stadiums for other reasons. So much history in those stadiums.
I believe they gave Soldier Field a makeover a few years ago, didn't they?
I believe so. At it's core, it is still Soldier Field. I believe they gave it a makeover and added a few more seats.
Soldier Field does have so much history. Lambeau Field even more.
Lambeau Field should be on the registry of historic sites.
I wouldn't be surprised if it wasn't.
I don't think it is, but I could be wrong.
What do you think is the worst stadium in the NFL?
What is the stadium the Dolphins play in?
I don't know what they call it now, but I agree, it's had its day.
It has had its day. They should build a new stadium there instead of remodeling that stadium and giving it a new name every year.
