Con Air is one of the best movies of all times, don't you think?
Definitely.
Nick Cage is great in that movie.
There are so many good actors in it.
Yeah, John Cusack too.
His character was great.
It was funny when he stole that guys car and it ended up flying behind the plane.
That was funny.
A lot of action too.
It was sweet how all he wanted to do was get his daughters teddy bear in the end.
Yeah, and it was all dirty.
The song from that movie was so popular.
They played it on the radio all the time.
Too bad it had an ending.
what do you mean?
So that they couldn't do a part two.
Yeah, I could've gone for a second one.
Well just got to watch the only one.
Yes, over and over.
Hope you have the DVD.
