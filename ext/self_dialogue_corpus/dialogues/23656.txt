Hey girl, how have you been?
I've been pretty good, how about you?
Great! I went to the movies last night with a few friends and saw the new Beauty and the Beast.
Oh really? What did you think about it?
I thought it was awesome! Emma Watson was amazing as Belle.
Oh, she plays the lead in that movie?
Yeah! The whole cast was stunning. There was Dan Stevens as the beast and Luke Evans as Gaston.
I heard they sang in that movie, did they really sing or did someone sing for them?
Yeah, they all trained before they started shooting in order to actually sing for their parts.
That's amazing, were they any good?
You bet! And the visuals were amazing, too. This movie was two hours of an artistic masterpiece.
What do you mean?
I mean the special effects were very high end.
So it looked realistic and the beast didn't look too cheesy?
I don't think so. They put a lot of effort into planning out their scenes and their character designs.
Was it much like the original cartoon?
Oh, yeah. It was almost exactly the same! It starts out the same, with the scenes and music, too.
I'll have to check it out then.
You should! I'd give this movie a 10/10.
That sounds awesome, I'm so excited to see it. Thanks!
