What do you think would have happened if Harry had not blackmailed Mary Jane?
He might have not fought with Peter. He might have also lived.
Harry is someone that was hard to feel sorry for
Harry had more money than Peter, so it would make sense that she would be attracted to Harry
Harry couldn't was so angry about his father's death
He kept it a secret from Peter about how he really felt
Yeah, I didn't see Harry and his dad as being that close in the first movie
Harry may have been closer to his dad than he was to Peter
The goblin and venom transformation made showed there to be bad influences that were beyond people's control
Yeah
