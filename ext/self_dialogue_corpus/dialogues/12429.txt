What was your favorite location in the Star Wars movies?
I can't remember all that many. I guess Tatooine?
Why Tatooine?
Well, it always felt like the home base for Star Wars. Both Anakin and Luke grew up there.
That makes sense.
What about you?
I kind of like Hoth.
The ice planet?
Yeah. I'm really into the winter aesthetic.
It did look really cool there.
