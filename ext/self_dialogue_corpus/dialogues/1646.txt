Dad, can I stay up and watch the game with you?
Son, Sunday night football is on until late. You have school tomorrow.
You have work tomorrow.
I know, but I am an adult.
I know, but I love watching the game with you.
I love that too, but I want you to get your rest.
I can sleep anytime, but I can't always watch a great great with my dad.
True, I don't want your mother to be angry at me.
She doesn't have to know.
She is on her girls retreat until Tuesday.
See, please dad.
Okay, you can stay up.
Thank you.
It will be fun.
I know.
Go get me a beer.
Ok. I got you me one too.
I don't think so.
No one has to know.
Give it to me kid.
