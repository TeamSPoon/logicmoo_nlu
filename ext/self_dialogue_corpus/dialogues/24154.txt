You know I have never seen any fantasy movies.
Are you trying to get in to the genre ?
I would like to give it a shot.
There are so many.
Are there different types or just anything with fantasy is rolled into one.
There are sort of earthly ones, period pieces and so on.
What should I start with ?
I would go with something that is a classic.
Which one would be the best classic?
Start with Lord of the Rings, the trilogy.
Are they good movies ?
They are amazing, they have everything , love, action, fantasy beasts.
I heard sometimes fantasy movies have the best love stories.
There is a beautiful story of an elf and a human in the Loren of the Rings.
Should I watch the Hobbit movies too?
They have all the same aspects, but are not as good as the original.
Did they keep the same actors in all of them?
The ones in the story. Like Ian Mckellen.
I loved him in the Xmen movies.
I will be sad to see him replaced.
