Who's your favorite Star Wars heroine?
I don't think that any actress can top Carrie Fisher as Princess Leia, but I have enjoyed the new female leads too.
Yeah, Daisy Ridley's portrayal of Rey in the new movies has been really good I think.
For sure, she's a great actress and fits the Jedi role perfectly. She's tough and likable at the same time.
I really enjoyed the relationship between Rey and Finn as well. Can't wait to see where that leads.
I know right, December can't come fast enough! I can't wait for the new movie.
What about Natalie Portman? What did you think about her as Anakin's love interest?
She was ok. The Star Wars movies that she was in were not my favorite, but she wasn't bad.
Yeah, my thoughts as well. Rey is my favorite new female lead, but Princess Leia will always be top of the list!
All this talk of Star Wars characters makes me want to have movie marathon this weekend and watch them all again!
