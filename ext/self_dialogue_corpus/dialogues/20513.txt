What is the worst movie you've seen
For me, it would have to be How the Grinch Stole Christmas
The animated one?
No the one starring Jim Carrey
What? How can you say that?
It just ruined the whole franchise for me
How so?
With the horrid adult jokes and twisting around the story to fit in some cheap references
Well at least the acting was good.
Yeah, Jim Carrey did fairly well, I'll give him that. But the script just wasn't good
And the makeup?
The Grinch's makeup was spectacular, but the makeup on the Whos was just...creepy
Yeah, I guess I can see your point there
But the worst part of the whole movie is just the cheap jokes
Oh you mean the slapstick?
No I just mean the added adult humor for the sake of the audience
What kind of adult jokes?
Well for starters, there's references to a lot of adult situations
I guess that is a tad inappropriate for a family movie
Yeah it caused me to lose all respect for it to be honest
