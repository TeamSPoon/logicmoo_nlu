Do you like romantic comedies?
Yes! I love Notting Hill.
That's a great movie.  Hugh Grant is adorable.
And so is Julia Roberts.
I don't really like her, but I like her there.
The bookstore is so cute.
I love the end, with them at the park with the gate.
Yes, that's like a fantasy.
I think the part about the painting was funny.
Yeah, that was great.
