Hey, do you watch Ice Hockey?
Yea, some.
Did you watch the game last night?
I caught part of it.
It was amazing! Did you see that back hand pass?
Oh yea I did! I was on the edge of my seat.
That body check during that play was rough.
He stood his ground though.
To bad there wasn't a breakaway after that.
Definitely, it would have tied the game and made it crazy exciting!
To bad you didn't see the start of the game.
Why?
Someone took a check to the head.
Oh wow!
Looked like a hard hit too.
Is he okay?
