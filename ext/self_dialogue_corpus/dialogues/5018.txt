Hey! Are you going to the ball game today?
Whose playing?
Seattle plays Baltimore today, but it's a double header!
What do you mean by double header?
Oh that means that they will play two games in a row on the same day.
Really? That sounds exhausting.
I know, but you get your money's worth as a fan!
I suppose that is right.  When does the game start?
The first game will begin at noon and the second game will follow.
Is there a break between games?
Yeah, there will be a short intermission for the field to be regrouped, but it won't be too long.
I don't know if I could spend the whole day at the park.
I know.  I always feel like a devoted fan when I attend a double header.
Can I just attend one game or do I have to go to both?
You can just come to one game.  When it comes to baseball games you can come and go as you please.
Going to a game does sound like fun, but I have some things to do this afternoon.
No worries. Complete you tasks and then give me a call.
Okay.
I plan on being at the ballpark all day!
Great! I'll catch up with you later.
