Who is the best team in the NFC?
Right now I would say Dallas
Not Atlanta?
i think they have a bad year, watch Ryan get hurt
Ouch no Seattle love either?
Yeah Seatlle might that team
Does their defense hold up?
Absolutely, I think itll be even better.
After Seattle who else could be it?
I think thats really it.
You never mentioned Green Bay
I dont think thy will be good this year.
Wow Aaron Rodgers is still there ya know
I understand that but hes getting older.
Any dark horses you can think of
Possibly Philadelphia
Wow thats bold, I Dont think they are that good yet
No they arent but they have potentioal.
And I guess New Englad is the best in the AFC
Without saying.
