I'm really starting to enjoy making my own music.
But I thought you said you didn't have any musical ability.
I don't. I can't sing or play any instruments. But I'm on Soundcloud and Reverbnation.
What? I don't understand. What music are you making, then?
Well, it's kind of a hobby. I make tracks with my ZOOM portable audio recorder.
How, though, if you can't play or sing anything?
It's easy. It's called "Ambient" or "Electronic" music.
Like Brian Eno or Kraftwerk or the Aphex Twins or The Orb?
Well, I'm not that good, but I try. I like to play non copy-written music, then mess with the tracks.
Like most classical music? Those are too old, usually, for a copyright. Or sound effects collections.
Yes. For example, I'll put Holst's "The Planets" on an old record-player in another room.
Then what? Add the sound of a train passing by and slow it down 300 percent, or speed it up?
Sometimes yes, actually! I'll record the sounds from a distance, play them backwards, change their speed.
Well, that might be plagiarism, if you're not careful!
Oh, no, when I'M done with the sounds, there's no way to recognize them.
You run the ambient sounds you record through some kind of audio software?
Yes, my old Mixcraft software, and I'll use weird recording techniques, like use a toilet paper tube around the microphone.
Making your own shotgun microphone. Interesting. I'd like to hear some of these.
I've got about 220 followers on Soundcloud now. Just started on Reverbnation.
Oh, my gosh. Maybe you can sell some of your tracks to a video game company or something!
