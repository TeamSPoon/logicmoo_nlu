I love comedies.
What is your favorite comedy?
I love the Austin Powers movies.
Oh yeah! Mike Myers is so funny.
That scene in the tent was hilarious!
Yes it was. How about the one where he was naked behind all of the props?
That one was good, too.
Did you like Wayne's World?
Yes! That was such a funny take on teens in the eighties.
Garth was funny.
