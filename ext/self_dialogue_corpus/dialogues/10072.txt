I think Mad Max is probably the best action film in a long time.
It's up there.  It's basically a nonstop car chase.
I was a bit disappointed that it didn't win more Oscars.
It's kind of tough for a film like that to win outside of some technical categories.
But it was very deserving.  Great performances, great direction...
But it's not really the type of movie to convince the academy.
Do they have any plans for a sequel?
Not that I've heard.  Might be a few years if it did happen.
I'll be first in line when it's released if it's released.
I'll be right there with you.
