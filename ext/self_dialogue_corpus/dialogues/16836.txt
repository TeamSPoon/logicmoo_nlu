Did you hear System of a Down is touring?
What? I thought they broke up.
They did but they're back together again.
No way! We should see them!
Unfortunately they're only touring over in Europe.
Ugh of course they are.
I'm glad to see them back together though.
Me too! That's so awesome.
I wonder if they'll write anymore music.
One can only hope.
I loved all their older stuff.
BYOB is always one of my favorite songs.
Yeah that one is a good one.
They just have so many to choose from!
They do! I like IEAIAIO.
Yup that is another great song.
I wonder if they'll record their shows.
I'm sure they will.
If we can we should buy a dvd of one.
Let's do it.
