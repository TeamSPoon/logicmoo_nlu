I'm putting together a Beatles playlist to listen to with my kids. Do have any suggestions of Beatles songs that are good for kids?
Definitely Octopus's Garden. And Yellow Submarine.
Yup, I 've got them, and Twist and Shout. What else?
Haha my Aunt used to sing "I Wanna Hold Your Hand" to me every time we crossed the street.
Aw, that's sweet, Okay, I guess I have to add that one.
Oh, and wasn't "Hey Jude" written for one of their kids? Add that one.
Okay. Any others?
"Julia" is a nice, mellow one. It reminds me of going to the beach.
Huh, I don't know that one.
It was on the White Album.
