Did you ever get it to any of Quentit Tarentino's movies?
The guy that made Kill Bill?
Yes, and many others.
No, I think I seen one movie of his.
He has some good stuff.
Like what?
Well, Kill Bill Volume One, I think is his best work.
That has Uma Therman right?
Yes, its sort of an odd film, but lots of drama and action.
I will have to check it out.
