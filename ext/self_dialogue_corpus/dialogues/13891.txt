Have you heard Lady Gaga's new album?
Yeah, Joanne? What do you think of it?
It's certainly different than her usual style.
Yeah, she's really breaking away from what she established.
I mean, it's nice to hear her branch out from pop.
True. Like her performance of Somwhere Over the Rainbow.
Yeah, now, THAT was an impressive expose.
For sure! She doesn't even need autotune; I don't see why they use it all the time on her albums.
Well, it's less about correcting her voice, and more about creating an effect.
Okay, yeah, I can see that.
