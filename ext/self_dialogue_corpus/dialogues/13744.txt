Do you like Lady Gaga?
While I like some of her music, she has always kind of annoyed me.
Yeah.  I know what you mean.  It is like she tries way to hard.
Exactly!  I do have to admit that she does have an incredible voice.
I know.  I was shocked when she performed Julie Andrews classics.
I know.  I was blown away.
I also like her duet with Tony Bennett.
She did do a good job with that.  Her other music is alright too.  I really like that Poker Face song when I am working out.
Agreed.  Her music is good to workout too.
Yep.  Like you said before, her music is good enough but her persona and antics are her drawback.  I guess it is what she had to do to get noticed.
