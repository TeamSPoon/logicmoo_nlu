What's your favorite basketball team?
I like the Pittsburgh Pirates
No that's not a basketball team!
I like the New York Rockets?
That team doesn't exist. The Rockets are in Houston.
You're in Houston.
Okay, back to seriousness. Have you ever been to a basketball game?
Yeah. I went to the U of Pitt basketball game once?
Nice. Did you know what was happening.
Yeah. I'm a sports guy.
So, what do you like about basketball?
I like when they kick the ball through the yellow posts.
No! You're confused again. That's not basketball.
You're not basketball.
You're acting like a child. I'm just asking you about basketball.
Okay. My favorite thing about basketball is when the crowd cheers very loudly.
There you go! That's something relevant.
Yeah, I also like it when the fourth quarter is close.
Close games are fun. We should watch a game sometime.
Sure bro.
