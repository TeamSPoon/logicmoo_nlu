Have you seen the movie "John Carter"?
No, I have never heard of it.
It is actually a Disney movie, but not for kids.  It is Science Fiction.
Really?  Is it a good movie?
Yes, I actually really liked it.  Its about a guy who finds an portal to travel to Mars and all sorts of action takes place.
I love alien movies!  I wish I would have heard of this sooner.
I don't know why it didn't do well at the box office.  It was a really good movie.
Maybe it wasn't advertised enough.
I don't think it was.  It is not just about aliens and science fiction.  There is a love story involved too.
That sounds great.  I will rent it this weekend.
