Somebody told me you were a big fan of The Smashing Pumpkins.
Back in the 90s and early 2000s, I was obsessed with the band.
How many times did you see them?
I followed the lead singer, Billy Corgan, with The Pumpkins, his later band Zwan, and his solo projects- 56 events total.
WOW. You were obsessed.
I had a hard life and a lot of hard times back then, and I found his voice really soothing and comforting.
Did you ever get to meet him and the other band members?
I met Billy many times, so much so he called me by name and made a point of coming over to say hi and autograph things for me.
How exciting! Did you get to meet the other band members?
I didn't get to meet Darcy from the Pumpkins, but I did Jimmy and James. And then the Zwan members, I met them all so many times they were super nice to me and would come say hi when they saw me outside and sign things.
Did you get pictures with the band members?
I have LOTS of pictures with the band members. I LOVE those pictures.
Who was your favorite band member?
Matt Sweeney from Zwan. He was the nicest musician I have ever met, so kind and sweet. I loved Paz too, and Jimmy.
And Billy Corgan?
He's like his reputation- he can be grumpy and arguementive, but he can also be sweet and angelic.
Did you like Smashing Pumpkins or Zwan better?
I actually liked Zwan better. The band seemed so fresh, and inventive, and the songs were so lyrical.
What's your favorite Zwan song?
Lyric- it's so inspiring and cheerful and uplifting.
