got a favorite nirvana album?
probably nevermind
favorite song?
i liked in bloom the best
i liked come as you are
how come?
that was my first nirvana song i ever heard.
yeah, that nostalgia factor.
come as you are was a copy of a different punk song
yeah, i heard about that
the song is so different though.
you mean killing joke "eighties" right?
yeah, that is the song
the vibe is completely different.
the riff is quite similar though
killing jokes version is much faster
kurt even admitted he stole it though
yeah, thats good on him
probably had to pay
yeah
