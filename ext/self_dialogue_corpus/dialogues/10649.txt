Have you seen Fate of the Furious yet?
Which one is that?
The newest one, eighth in the installment.
Of course, that makes complete sense.
It stars Charlize Theron as Cipher.
Oh yes, I have seen it.  She is one of the best villains I think.
Yea, she did a great job, as she does in almost all her work.
It was sad to see a movie in the franchise without Paul.
Yea he will always be missed.
He did so much for the franchise and the scene in general.
