I'm in the mood for a comedy, something familiar, you know? maybe one with Bill Murray...
Uhm, the first one that comes to mind is "Ghostbusters"! It's a total classic.
Who else was in it? I think I remember Sigorney Weaver, and Harold Ramis as Egon Spengler!
Oh, yeah, he's totally dreamy. Didn't he write and direct it?
Yeah, along with Murray, but...what was the other guy's name, who played Ray? Did he help write it too?
Oh, that was Dan Aykroyd. You know most everybody who was in it was either from Saturday Night Live or Second City.
Wow, those were the golden days of live television comedy. I loved SNL back then.
Yep, they reall could make you laugh! And what about Slimer, the green slime ghost?!
HAH, drinking wine, eating hot dogs and sliming Murray! That was awesome!
I never told you, but I had a secret crush on Jeanine, the secretary. Annie Potts was the actress.
Ooh heh, how about that scene where Egon is under her desk connecting the monitor? "I can see you're a very haaaandy person."
Oh yeah, "I collect spores, mold and fungus!" Where si they come up with the lines?
It's sheer genius. I can hear the soundtrack as the movie opens with that ghostly Theramin making all that eery music!
What's a Theramin? Some kind of haprsichord?
Nope. It's a box with two antennas like rabbit ears, and it makes creept music when you wave your hands around the aerials.
Well whatever it is, it makes the opening for me! That librarian in the New York Public Library getting her skirt scared off was intense.
Naw, Rick Moranis getting chased around by the minion of Zul was even better! "Okay who brought the dog?"
No, what about the twinkie? "What's all this about the twinkie, Ray?
My favorite part is when Ray thinks of the Stay-Puff marshmallow man!
Makes you want to watch it, right? I could use some of that Gozer the Gozarian right now!
