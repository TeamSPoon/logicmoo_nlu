The new Atlanta Braves baseball stadium is amazing.
Did you know they have to turn off the waterfall in the outfield during the game?
I heard about that, I think the baseball rulebook would consider it a distraction.
Speaking of distractions, some players on the Mets don't like it when fans do the wave.
That's surprising, the wave is one the best parts of the game for the fans.
It can make a boring game more fun, but I think it upsets the players if the game is close.
Do you think Harper is going to have another MVP year?
I hope he does well, he has a lot of fans in Washington.
I haven't really taken to instant replay in baseball.
Me too, I find that it distracts from the integrity of the game.
Did you know that every instant replay is reviewed remotely by someone in New York City?
That's amazing, no wonder the reviews tend to take so long.
On a good note, Freddie Freeman is having another amazing year for the Braves.
If Freeman and Harper were on the same team, I'd be really excited.
The game has changed, players get shuffled around much more these days.
Yes, it's harder to really bond with a team and form a connection with the players.
Who do you think the World Series champions are going to be this year?
I think the Cubs are going to do it again, Epstein is genius general manager.
Epstein is an amazing general manager, I agree, first the Red Sox and now the Cubs.
I can definitely see him bringing that magic to the Milwaukee Brewers some day!
