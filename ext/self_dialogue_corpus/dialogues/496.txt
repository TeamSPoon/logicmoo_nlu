NFL season's coming up. I sure hope my team does well.
You're not still a Ram's fan; are you?
What else would I be? They just had a bad season.
I'll say it was a bad season. Coach Fisher got axed and the owner put the rest of the team on notice.
The team's a brand. It's worth almost $1.5 billion.
The revised estimate values them at $2.9 billion.
That's one of the reasons why they're my favorite team.
Keep in mind though that they lost to the 49ers 28-0. And that was a horrible season for the 49ers.
Maybe with Coach Fassel they'll do better this season.
Actually, Sean McVay is their new coach. I thought you said that this was your team.
I hadn't heard about that.
It was announced the day that the Chargers moved to Los Angeles.
I didn't know that the Chargers were an LA team now.
They're part of the Western Conference now. It's time for the Rams to shape up, or ship out as the saying goes.
The Rams have a long LA history, though.
The San Diego Chargers do too. They were the Los Angeles Chargers before moving to San Diego.
Yeah, and the Rams were the Cleveland Rams back in the day.
How do you think they're going to make a comeback this upcoming season?
Well, they've got good players -- Jared Goff, Malcolm Brown, Tavon Austin.
We'll see if that makes a difference this time around.....
