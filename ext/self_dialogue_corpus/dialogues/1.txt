Have you seen all of the Fantastic Four movies?
Yes I have, even the one with Michael B. Jordan.
Yes he's an excellent actor. I loved the fact that they made The Human Torch Black.
Yes that was a nice touch. I like the original ones with Jessica Alba better.
Right, they were funnier and explained a lot more about the characters.
I think I'd like to have Johnny Storm's powers if I could have any of of them.
I'd probably prefer Reed Richard's powers since I'm lazy and don't like to get up for things. I could just stretch and reach for them.
That's hilarious. They made a great team though, and had great chemistry.
Yes I'm wondering if they'll come out with another one.
The movies were great but they weren't that great. They should just leave it as is.
