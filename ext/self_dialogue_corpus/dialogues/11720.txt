So, Sgt. Pepper is 50 years old.
Yeah, I guess it is. They're releasing a new version of it now.
Oh, really? Did they work Strawberry Fields and Penny Lane back into it somehow?
No, they didn't. That would have been the smart thing to do, right?
Guess I'll just stick with my own playlist, then! The album doesn't really work so well without them.
I know what you mean. I mean, there are some neat experiments in there, but there's not much that really stands out until the end.
A Day in the Life, you mean?
Right. But even that... honestly, the Paul segment could go. I don't know what else to do with it, but oy.
Yeah, there's that great climax of sound, and then... doopy doopy doo, I'm Paul McCartney; aren't I a fop!
I keep blending that transition in my mind with Bohemian Rhapsody. It's an improvement.
