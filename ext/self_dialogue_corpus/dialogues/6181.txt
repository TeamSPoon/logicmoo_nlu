Do you remember your first animated Disney movie growing up?
It's hard to recall, but I think it was either the 1938 Snow White and the Seven Dwarves or the 1942 Bambi. What about yourself?
Probably either One Hundred and One Dalmatians or The Sword in The Stone.
Sword in the Stone and Robin Hood were, and still are, among my favorite.
Mine also. Really need to go back and watch some of these Disney classics.
After binge watching Once Upon a Time I've had an itch to do the same. Probably start with Sleeping Beauty or Peter Pan.
Peter Pan is another personal favorite, and I loved Robin Williams portrayal of Peter in Hook.
Hook was great and I'm still heartbroken about Robin Williams passing away. Still fondly remember seeing him in Flubber in theaters with the family.
That's awesome! Think the only live action Disney movie I've seen in theaters, besides a Star Wars or Marvel Comics one, was One Hundred and One Dalmatians.
Another nicely done live action Disney film. I was tickled to death when I found out the actors who played Gregory House and Arthur Weasley were in it!
