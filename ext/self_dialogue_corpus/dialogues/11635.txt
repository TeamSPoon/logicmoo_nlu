Have you seen across the universe, the movie?
Yes, I loved it so much.
Me too. i don't know why it was not better received critically.
I am baffled as well. I see something new and powerful in it each new viewing.
What is your favorite cover in it?
I think while my guitar gently weeps was very well done. The vocals those actors have were so raw and emotion filled.
Martin Luther McCoy was the actor who sang that one.
I think I enjoyed his version even more than the original.
That is saying something, to out do a beatle.
It is indeed. I really did feel his vocals were just that powerful on an already great song.
