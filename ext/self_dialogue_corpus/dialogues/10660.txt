What do you think about the Luke Hobbs character?
Wait, who's that.
He's Dwayne Johnson's character in the Fast & Furious series.
Oh, right. I like him.
I do, too. I just felt like they threw him in there too suddenly.
That's true. He just kind of appeared for Fast Five.
Without any story to carry over, either.
Well, I'm not sure if you remember this or not.
What's that?
Tokyo Drift, chronologically, comes way after any of the others, so by that point, Hobbs was already introduced to the team.
