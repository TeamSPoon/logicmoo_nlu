Jay-z is okay he has a lot going on these days besides just the rapping.
What do you mean by that? what is he doing lately that i don't know about?
Well Jay-z has done lots of businesses and Philanthropy he has designed sneakers and clothes.He has also helped lot's of individuals become successful.
Wow that's cool and I like his music too. Bonnie and Clyde drove me crazy I played it so much.I dogged it.
They already had one child it was a girl they named it blue Ivy and now they are having twins did she have them yet?
I believe so i think they are still in the hospital I know she will be happy when they get out. They have a great Dad.
Yeah they are still together and most of the stars don't have much to loose or worry about with their loot they have.
True with all the businesses and music they have made with both of their fortunes the kids will never have to go broke.
Nope they sure won't Jay-z is always moving up doing more and more in the celebrity world he is a very talented man and so is his wife.
