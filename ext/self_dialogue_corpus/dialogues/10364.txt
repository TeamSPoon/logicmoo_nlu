Hi there! How are you doing today?
Fine, thanks, how about you?
I'm good, thanks. I just finished watching "Fury", have you ever seen that movie?
Is that the one with Brad Pitt in it?
Yes, it was a long movie, but probably one of the best war movies I've seen in awhile.
That's funny, because last week-end, my boyfriend really wanted me to watch it with him, but it was so long, I fell asleep!
You'll have to watch it again sometime, it's really good. But of course, anything with Brad Pitt in it has to be good!
Not necessarily.....he's had some bombs!
That's true. I recently saw the trailer for "Berlin Syndrome"; the leading actress is Teresa Palmer.
Not sure I've heard of that movie or the actress.
The movie is a thriller and looks really good. Teresa Palmer was also in "The Choice" and a lot of other good movies.
Oh yeah, gotcha, now I know who you mean. I'll have to watch the trailer to that, I like her too.
Sometimes I can't figure out if I like the actual movie better, or the songs that they play in the movies.
I was going to say the same thing, when you mentioned the movie "The Choice"!
Yes, I love that kind of music!
I have the soundtrack from the movie "The Choice"! There's a lot of classical music on there by Marcelo Zarvos.
Now you have me wanting to go watch it again, to listen to them more closely.
Do it! The songs are quite relaxing and take you to places that one can only dream of!
I'm going to the Video store later today to pick up a copy of it.
Better yet, just go out and buy the soundtrack; you won't be disappointed!
