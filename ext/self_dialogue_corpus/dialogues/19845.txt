Do you use spotify?
I do.
What are some of the last songs on your spotify?
Ode to Sleep by Twenty One Pilots, California High by Billy,  and Wicked Game by James Vincent Mcmorrow.
Ahh, we have different taste I think.
What are yours?
I was last listening to Britney Spears, The Spice Girls and The Backstreet Boys.
Oh, was it a 90's playlist?
No, I just really like 90's music.
I see.
Yeah, Britney Spears is my Idol.
Oh why?
Her music is pop but it makes me feel really good.
I think that's how music should be. I cry every time I hear James Vincent Mcmorrow's version of Wicked Game.
Actually cry?
Yes. Music is so emotional for me.
Wow, Oops I Did it Again has never done that.
But you like it, it makes you happy.
Yeah.
Thats how music should work.
