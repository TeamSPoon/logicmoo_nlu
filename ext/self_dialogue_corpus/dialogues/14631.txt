Ok then how much money do the D league players make?
Well consiering NBA players are some of the best payed athletes in the world, in comparison it won;t seem much
How much? On the average?
Well, they range. From something like 25000 to 13000
That's not much at all.
No. It's a barely a life sustaining wage considering the amount of food they have to eat to stay healthy.
Why do they do it? It's amazing.
Again, for the chance. If they perform well, they might make it to the big league. It's their dream.
That's a big gamble.
Not really considering many read at a 5th grader's level.
Get out... no way, they went to college?
No, for real. They focus on playing the sports from middle school and on. And their academic development gets stalled and schools don't really do anythign about it
That's just plain wrong.
So you see why they're willing to get paid 13000 for a dream of being able to play in the big league.
Yeah...
See for me that's what's sad to me. Not that they're rejected and then still holding on to their dreams. But rather, they think they don't have much other options.
Oh my god stop. You're gonna make me cry.
Well if they make it, it's all good and well, but many of them don't. And what do you think they're capable of doing? Their communications degree won't get them a job in a corporate world.
I wonder what happens to those who don't get picked in the D leagues. What do they do after a couple of years?
Some get jobs, doing things unrelated to Basketball, others get basketball coaching jobs, and high schools, community colleges, universities. etc.
