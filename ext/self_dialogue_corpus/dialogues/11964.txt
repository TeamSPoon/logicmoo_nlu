Hi, have you seen the Star Wars movies?
You mean the new ones or the old ones?
The new ones in theaters.
Yeah! I saw Force Awakens, but I haven't seen Rogue One.
Oh! You have to watch Rogue One.
Well I didn't really like Force Awakens.
What! How couldn't you. It was so good?
I guess I've never been a die hard Star Wars fan.
Me neither but trust me, it gets good at Rogue One.
Okay, let's watch it some time.
