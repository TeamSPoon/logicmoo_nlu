Hey! Who's your team?
Oh I've been a big Seahawks fan ever since Russel Wilson joined.
Yeah he's a great player and he's one of those guys that is super likable. Have you seen his charity work with sick kids?
Hell yeah. I follow him on Instagram. He's such a good guy. Which team do you support?
Well I'm from Cleveland so I feel obligated to support the Browns. I sometimes like the Cowboys though because it's nice to see a team win occasionally.
Oh yeah I feel it. Browns fans are very loyal.
That's how we do it in Cleveland. It becomes sort of a rite of passage in Cleveland to go to a snowy game where the Browns get shut out.
What did you think of Johnny Football?
Well, Cleveland is kind of cursed anyway. But he was just an irresponsible kid.
Why do you like the Cowboys?
Ezekiel Eliot! I'm a big Ohio State fan and I like to keep up with where my Buckeyes go.
Oh yeah that makes sense. He's great. Did you see his ESPN photo shoot?
Yep. He's looking good. And his career is looking good too.
Yes it is. The Cowboys are lucky.
Have you ever been to a game?
Only once but it was great. I'd like to go again but I have to save up the money.
Which game did you go to?
Seahawks 49ers game in Seattle. That stadium is loud!
Oh yeah Centurylink Field is always on the news for being loud.
Yeah that's true. It's even rumored to give the Seahawks an advantage because the other team can't hear.
