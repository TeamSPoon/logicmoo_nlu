You've seen Psycho right?
Only the remake, wasn't it mostly shot for shot anyway?
It was, but there's something about the black and white that adds to the suspense and while I like Vince Vaughn, he's no Anthony Perkins.
I'll have to watch it, I do enjoy old horror movies.
Oh you will undoubtedly love it, then you will want to watch the sequels, won't get enough of Normon Bates.
I'm pretty excited, maybe I'll watch this Saturday evening.
Let me know if you do, I'll catch it again. Another one you should check out would be Black Christmas.
Haven't seen it either, but I hear it influenced Halloween.
Oh it sure did, without it John Carpenter may have never had the inspiration.
Wow a world with no Michael Myers, thanks Black Christmas!
