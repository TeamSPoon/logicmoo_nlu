Do you have an all time favorite comedy?
Yes! I love Meet the Fockers with Ben Stiller!
Oh yeah, I love him in Zoolander also!
Basically, every movie he does has 5 stars from me!
Barbara Streisand played his mother, right?
Yes and she is a therapist and gives the funniest advice.
What the name of the other funny guy in the movie with blonde hair?
Oh! You probably are talking about Owen Wilson!
He plays Pamela's ex boyfriend.
It's good to be in the circle of trust and we use that joke all the time!
