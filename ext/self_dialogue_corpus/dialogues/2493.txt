I feel like the Patriots and Seahawks could meet in the superbowl if everyone stays healthy.
Yea, I agree, but I would bet more on the Seahawks.
Yea, I think you might be wrong about that one. The Patriots are still at their peak.
I mean, you are right, but Seattle is too.
Yea, Seattle just has been in the news for more bad things lately. Like Richard Sherman's antics.
Yea, he has a to just chill. He is smart, but needs to tone it down.
Yea, but he hasn't to this point and I doubt he ever will.
I agree, but he is still a great player.
Yea, well both teams should have good years.
Yea, I'm not sure if anyone can challenge the patriots in the AFC either honestly.
Yea, I feel like there are more good teams in the NFC this year.
It does feel that way. More competition too.
Well, maybe some teams will step up.
Yea, like Tennessee and Miami. Its about time they both show up.
Yea, they both have good young quarterbacks.
Yea, but one may not actually be good.
I am not sure about Tannehill. Maybe this is the year he really shows what he can do.
I hope so! He has a lot of receivers around him.
Well, we know what Mariota can do.
Yes, we found that out at times last year. I want to see more!
