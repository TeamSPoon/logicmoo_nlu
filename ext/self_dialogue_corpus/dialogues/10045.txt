I just watched Bloon n Bones.
Oh I've seen that, with Michael Jai White.
Yea, that was crazy. That prison scene at the beginning was great.
Yea, I really liked they put kimbo slice in it.
The fight scene where he keeps doubling the best was cool too.
Oh, yea, that was awesome how he kicked all three of those guys at once.
Yea, and when the guy put the money in his pants and Michael Jai ripped the money right out, that was really awesome.
Yea it was, I couldn't believe he did that!
I really hope they come out with a second one.
Me too, that movie was really good.
