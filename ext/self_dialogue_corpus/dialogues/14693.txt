What do you think about Durant moving to Golden State?
I'm pretty sure he just wants a ring and this is his easiest path to get one.
Yeah. I agree.
I'm also not sure how well he'll integrate into their system.
He's a big that they needed though.
That's true, their size is a detriment at times.
Especially against LeBron.
Ohh, that stings; 3-1.
I'm not sure how they'll ever get over that.
It's going to be tough.
Going 73-9 doesn't mean a thing if you ain't got that ring.
Yeah, still impressive what they did last year though.
I don't think I've won 73 anything in my life.
Me neither.
Who did Cleveland lose though?
Deli, but that's about it.
Man, that team is stacked too.
It's really a two race team this season.
So much for parity in the NBA.
Yup, crazy.
