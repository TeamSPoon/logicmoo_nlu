Bro, you ready for football?
Heck yes! Who you got winning this year?
I got the Minnesota Vikings! No ones going to stop that defense.
You're funny! They'll never make it past Aaron Rodgers! He's the best in that division!
Don't count Sam Bradford out. He's a poor man's Aaron Rodgers but we have a better defense than those cheeseheads!
Yea, right! Who do you think taking the AFC conference?
Either the Raiders or the Patriots.
Me, too. But, that's only if Brady and Carr make it through the whole season.
Yea Carr got hurt last year and Brady's getting old too.
True but you can never count the G.O.A.T Tom Brady out.
Yea, the cheating Patriots never fails.
Call them cheaters all you want but they're the best in history.
I don't know. You still have the Packers, Steelers, and Niners if you're talking history.
After this season, Patriots will be the sure best.
Yea, stop living in the past.
Don't forget about Atlanta, too.
That's funny! Go to the Super Bowl to only spoil the lead.
That was just bad coaching.
Should have killed time instead of throwing it.
Man, the nfl is rigged!
