I kept seeing advertisements all over the place for this one movie that didn't look great, but I can't think of the name of it. Do you know which one I mean?
I couldn't say. What was it about?
It's about this kid being born on Mars and then going back to Earth.
Oh, you must mean The Space Between Us.
Yeah, that's it! Have you seen it?
I have. It's kind of a mess.
In what ways is it a mess?
Well, Asa Butterfield is a great young actor. He was very solid in Ender's Game, but he couldn't save this one.
It did seem a bit cheesy. Was it that?
Yes, partly. The dialogue wasn't working, and it was trying too hard to be both a sci-fi film and a romantic comedy.
Fair enough. So I shouldn't see it?
No. But what have you seen lately that you liked?
Logan was really fantastic.
Do you usually like superhero films?
No, not at all. I found that it really went beyond the superhero genre.
How so?
It was in the end just a touching story about the end of life. Logan and Patrick Stewart's character were going through serious difficulties.
And they resolved those difficulties?
Yes. At least, they resolved them in personally satisfying ways.
Sounds great. Thanks.
