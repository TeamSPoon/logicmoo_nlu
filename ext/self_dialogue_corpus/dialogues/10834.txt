What is you favorite Fast and Furious movie?
I didn't see but one or two.
I can't remember the first one very well it was so long ago
Yes that was 2001 with Vin Diesel
Right that was one of the reasons I wanted to see it was he was someone new and interesting to see as a character.
That didn't last long. He got really boring to watch.
You are right about that. He didn't entice me to want to watch that next two Fast and Furious movies.
I saw them. Not so great.
When Tokyo Drift came out I wanted to go see it just for the drifting because it looked so cool. But I never went.
I didn't go because they were all the same to me
