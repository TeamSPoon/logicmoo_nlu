What did you think of the superbowl.
I thought it was going to be a blowout and then... wow.
I know, what a heartbreaking end for atlanta.
Yeah, but give the pats credit, they never gave up.
I hate the patriots and Tom brady.
Oh they aren't that bad, but I am an AFC guy so I'll usually root for them in the superbowl.
I support the NFL all the way. Go packers!
The NFC does have some blue bloods and great rivalries don't they.
Yeah, the NFC North is just a classic division.
I've always admired the bears.
... I'm not sure we can still be friends. Haha just kidding.
What do you think about all the relocation that's happening.
I understand it, but it's still surprising that it's now 3 teams. Especially because 2 are going to the same city.
I agree.  At least the raiders picked Las vegas.  That will make for a fun road trip when they play the cheifs.
Do you go to a lot of chiefs games?
Yes, arrowhead is my favorite stadium, the fans are crazy.
I've always liked the open classic stadiums too.  The new cowboys facility is impressive though isn't it.
Definitely, it's amazing.  Too bad it doesn't help them win.
No, but dak Prescott might just be the one to change all that.
True, he was really impressive as a rookie.  I'm glad they chose him over romo.
