Hey have you heard of the beatles?
Of course, they are legendary!
Really? Would you consider yourself a fan of them?
Yeah, but mostly their early stuff. I love that old rock sound.
What about their later stuff and solo songs?
It doesn't hit me much. I did like Imagine though
Yeah, it's such a sweet and mellow tune. I love it too!
Whats your favorite song
I would have to say Hey Jude
Yeah, that one is popular too
