At our weekly lunches we've been talking about movies.
Right.
And your favorite is Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.
Right again.
And you like The Graduate, Forrest Gump, and Fiddler on the Roof.
Where are you going with this?
Well, do you like any movies from this century?
Very funny.  But we've talked about some recent movies.
O.K., well give me one recent movie that isn't well known that you would like me to see.
O.K., Brooklyn
That movies is known--it was nominated for an academy award.
O.K. then--what's it about?
New York.
You've proved my point, a good movie not widely known.
Well, tell me what is it about?
It's a simple movie about an Irish girl who comes to America and the adjustments she must make.
That doesn't sound very exciting.
Well there aren't car chases, but the actress, someone named Ronan I believe, is wonderful, and there is the conflict between her being Irish and her Italian boyfriend.
There must be more.
Well, the main drama comes when she's called back to Ireland and must decide between an Irish suitor and her boyfriend in America.  I won't spoil the ending for you.
