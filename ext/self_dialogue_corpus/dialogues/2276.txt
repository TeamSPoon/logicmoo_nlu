What's your favorite NFL team?
Mine is the Clemson Tigers.  My son went to school there.
Where is Clemson?
It's in South Carolina.  Their rivals are the South Carolina Gamecocks
I think I've seen them play before.  What are their colors?
Purple and orange and their mascot is a tiger.  Their coach right now is Dabo Swinney.
Why are they your favorite team?
They have a really strong defensive line.  Martin Aiken is really talented.
Are they playing Kent State for their first game?
Yes they are.  The game is September 2.  It's at the Clemson Memorial Stadium and I have tickets.
That should be a good game.  When do they play Florida State?
On November 11th.
Florida State is my favorite team.
Really?  Why do you like them so much?
I think they have a great offensive line.  The new quarterback Deondre Francois is going to do well this year.
I still don't think they can beat Clemson.
They had a bad year last year but I'm really looking for them to pull it back.
Their defense is terrible though.
Derwin James is back from his injury this season though so I expect that to improve.
We'll have to see how wins the Atlantic Coast Conference
