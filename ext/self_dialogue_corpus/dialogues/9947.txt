have you heard of the upcoming black panther movie?
i have and i am so in love with the trailer already!
it looks remarkable so far!
chadwick really is a good actor for black panther.
i agree!. he really is suitable for the role
the trailer was kind of sad though.
how so? did it bother you when his father died?
yes, it did, but i hope he become one of the best super heroes!
i second that statement!
but the movie will be a while until it is released. lets hope its as good as the trailer shows us.
