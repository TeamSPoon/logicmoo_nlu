Have you seen the newest Fast & Furious movie?
No. I thought that the trailer made it look really silly.
What makes you say that?
I just find it silly that it evolved from street racing to basically vehicular warfare.
Okay, well that does sound pretty silly.
My point exactly. That's why I didn't watch the new one.
Oh. Well, I watched it, and I definitely thought it was alright.
Was there anything too remarkable about it?
It had great looking action scenes.
That's about what I expected.
