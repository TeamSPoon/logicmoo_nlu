Do you like the new star wars movies?
I guess they are ok.
What's wrong with them?
There's nothing wrong with them, I just miss the old characters.
They have a lot of the old characters in them though.
Yea, I know, but only as nostalgia.
Well, they are too old to be action starts now.
That's true, but I hate that they killed Han Solo.
I heard that Harrison Ford told them to because he was tired of doing the movies.
Yea I heard that too.
