What is your favorite Friday the 13th movie?
I love the third one.
I didn't see that one.
Are you a fan of the series?
Of course.
Then you have to see part 3.
Nice. I will check it out.
It is the first movie where Jason wears the hockey mask.
That is awesome. Do they show his face?
Yeah, it's very cool.
