Who do you think is the greatest singer of all time?
You realize that's very debatable, right?
Yeah but just go with it.
So what about Robert Plant?
Good choice! I love his voice and artistry.
Sounds like you're a fan. Who would you choose>
Going with my gut, I'm picking Aretha Franklin.
I get that. She's a phenomenon.
Right. Such mastery and emotion.
I think she'd be high on that list.
So who else would rate highly. There's lots of good singers.
And there's a difference between singing and carrying a tune.
Tell me who you like then.
Elvis, James Brown, Annie Lennox, and Patti LaBelle.
Well they all have chops. I like them.
Who are other singers you like?
Michael Jackson, Sinead O'Connor, and Patsy Cline.
Nice choices. I suspect we could go at this all day.
Its an interesting topic.
Maybe we could make a list and compare notes.
