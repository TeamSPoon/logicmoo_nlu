Hey, have you heard any good country music lately?
I've been listening to a lot of Tim McGraw.  He's my favorite for sure.
What songs of his do you like best?  I've never listened to him much.
Well, he's one of the first country singers who blends country and pop music.  I think you'd enjoy his sound.
That's interesting.  I didn't know that.
Yeah, and he's also been in a bunch of movies.  He's married to Faith Hill, and they do duets.
Wow, like what songs?
It's Your Love and Just To See You Smile are several that come to mind.
That's interesting.  I like Faith Hill.
Yeah, she has a beautiful voice.  They sound great together.
Well I'll be sure to listen to him soon.  What songs should I start with?
Why don't you try his greatest hits album?  Then you can hear his best songs all in one place.
Okay, that's a good idea.
I Like It, I Love It is one of the best for sure.  But there are so many good ones.
That sounds familiar, I might've heard it before.
Yeah, they all have a great catchy beat.
Okay, and which albums have Faith Hill on them?
Oh, I'm not too sure.  He actually did a duet with Nelly, too.
The hip hop artist?
Yep, that's the one!  Surprising isn't it.
