What is the best Marvel movie?
I'm going to go with Captain America starring Matt Salinger from the early 90s.
Haha!  That one was pretty great, but I think Captain America: Civil War is my favorite.  I like moral ambiguity.  Which side is right, which is wrong.
That is a great movie.  I'm Team Cap all the way, but he's my favorite, so I'm biased.  I really like Guardians of the Galaxy.
Yeah, those are excellent.  Talk about making secondary characters relevant.  And, the soundtracks are amazing, especially Volume 2.
Sylvester Stallone was in that, and he's my favorite actor, so that was exciting.
What do you think about the Fox X-Men series?
I think they're ok, but I hate that they'll never be able to cross over with other Marvel properties.
Maybe the Fantastic Four?
After that last Fantastic Four movie flopped, I doubt it.
