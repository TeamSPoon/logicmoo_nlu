Did you like the role of Anakin Skywalker?
I loved the story behind him.
Yeah but did you love the way he was played.
I thought it could have had room for improvement.
How about Natalie Portman's character
She did a great job as a ruler.
I think it was good too
I just think people dont love the prequels
I always caution against going backwards in a film.
Im glad the franchise is going forward now.
