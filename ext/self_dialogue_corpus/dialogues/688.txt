Do you think football is losing its popularity?
I think it is a little.
I do too.
What do you think the reason is?
I don't know if there is one reason.
I think it's several factors.
I think it's overexposed.
You mean to many games on?
That's exactly what I mean.
I'd have to agree with that.
I think the product gets watered down.
We really don't need a Thursday night game.
I will agree with that.
Some of the Thursday night games are terrible l
They sure are.
I think it's a disadvantage for some teams.
What do you mean?
Some teams only have a few days rest while other teams might be coming off a bye week.
That's a great point.
A lot of rest vs no,rest.
