Seen any Lifetime movies?
Those movies made for tv? Yes I have.
What do you think?
I like some, but they seem to much drama for me.
Well it is television for women.
Yeah, but even being a woman I still think the movies can be a little much.
I enjoy them, some of the movies are good.
Yeah, must say most do have a great moral to it.
Shows a lot of family problems, and relationship problems in lives too.
That is where I lose interest sometimes, seems they overdo the movies a little bit.
Well it is dramatized for a reason.
I prefer movies that cuss, and are rated R.
Why is that?
Movies that have a R rating seem more exciting.
Well, I disagree. The pixar movies by disney are pretty cute.
Of course they are, cause they are geared towards children.
Well, as an adult I enjoy those movies too.
I did like FInding Nemo. That was really cute.
It did have a good moral to the story too.
They came out with a second one, called Finding Dory.
