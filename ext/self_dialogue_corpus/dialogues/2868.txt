Hey man, do you watch the NFL?
Yes, what's up?
Who do you think is the worst team in the NFL?
Probably the Buffalo Bills.
Why do you think them?
They have no quarterback, and no defense.
The Bills defense was good, they finished above .500 last year!
Yeah, true, maybe the Browns then.
The Browns are never competitive, their quarterback draft pick was a bust too.
Who Johnny Manziel?
Yeah, he sucks, but Cody Kessler is way better and he isn't a bad guy.
Still, they have no superstars.
The Browns are probably the worst on a yearly basis.
I don't get it, what do they do with all of their draft picks?
They just don't assimilate and play as a team.
The Lions have been pretty bad since losing Calvin Johnson, and their quarterback is kind of weak too.
The Lions are decent, but not a great team.
Who else can you think of?
I think we have it settled, the Browns are the worst team in the NFL.
Agreed.
