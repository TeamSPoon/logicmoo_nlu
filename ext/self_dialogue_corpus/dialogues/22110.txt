Have you seen the previews for The Mummy?
There is a new mummy?
Yes. I think it looks good.
Is Brendan Fraiser in it?
No. I don't think it is related to the last two or three mummy movies
It is brand new? It is a reboot?
I think so. This one stars Tom Cruise
Oh interesting
It looks really good.
Is it a horror movie?
No. I don't think so. I think it is more Action
That makes sense with Tom Cruise starring
I think they are making a shared Cinematic universe with The Mummy
Really what other movies will be in this?
I think it is going to be different monsters
Like who?
I think Dracula, Frankensteing, and Wolf man are going to be in this universe
Are they going to fight each other or something?
I'm not sure. I think they are just copying what Marvel has been doing
Seems like every movie nowadays is part of a greater universe.
