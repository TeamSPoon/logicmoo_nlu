Do you enjoy the NFL?
I do quite a lot.
How long have you been a fan?
For as long as I can remember.
Was your dad a fan?
Oh yeah, big NFL fan.
Did he have a favorite team?
The greenbay packers.
Let me guess Favre is his favorite player.
He loved him.
For good reason he was emotional and his play showed that.
He was one of the best players of all time.
I agree.
Do you think anyone will be as good as him?
I do actually but not anytime soon.
He brought this emotional play that nobody else has.
You felt his emotion as he played it was great.
That's what set him apart.
I do agree with that.
I wish he still played.
