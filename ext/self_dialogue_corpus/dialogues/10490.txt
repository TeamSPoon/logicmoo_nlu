Hi there.
Hello.
Been up to anything lately?
I've been watching Lord of the Rings.
Which one?
What do you mean which one?
I mean. the Peter Jackson ones or the animated ones?
There were animated ones?
Yeah, back in the seventies or osmething like that,
Well obviously I'm not watching those since I don't know they existed.
Well, that makes sense. So the Peter Jackson ones then?
Which ones are those?
The ones that were made by... Peter Jackson?
... They have a lot of CGI.
Okay yeah, so it's the Peter Jackson ones.
Oh yeah! Those ones! I've been watching those ones.
So have you been enjoying them?
No, they're terrible!
Why do you think they're terrible?
Because they keep killing the Orcs! It's disgraceful! The Orcs are just peaceful immigrants, fleeing from a wartorn homeland!
