Have you seen Beauty and the Beast?
No.  I never even saw the cartoon from the 90s.
Really?  How could you have never even seen the cartoon?
I don't know.  I just never was into any of the Disney cartoons.
The movie was awesome.
I've heard that it was.
Do you plan on seeing the live action movie?
Not really.  I mean it seems too romantic for me.
Oh, it's a cultural icon though.
Just because everyone else is seeing it doesn't mean I will.
