Do you ever watch TCM?
Turner classic movies, I do !
I love old movies and this channel for putting them on with no commercials.
I agree. Now there are so many commercials a two hour movie takes like 3 or more on tv.
Yes,and they still probably cut it down to fit in the time slot.
It is hard to fully appreciate a film when viewed that way. Pacing is all off.
I couldn't agree more.  It is so fragmented with all the commercials breaks almost no through line to follow.
Ya that is one reason I am so happy tcm is commercial free.
I love that they have specials on different actors each month.
Me too, this month is audrey hepburn!
I love her. I caught love in the afternoon. Have you seen any?
They also played wait until dark and green mansions I was around to watch those two.
I love wait until dark.
She is strong in her acting in that part.
Also so much suspense throughout.
Yes, it is very thrilling. What about green mansions, seen it?
I have but not one of my top choices for audrey films.
I enjoy it. Her husband was the director of it.
I heard that she was pretty ill  with kidney stones at the time of filming.
Yes that was one reason they did most the shooting on a lot. Only some shots were on location.
