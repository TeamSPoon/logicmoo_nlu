Are their any new rule changes in the NFL this season?
Yes their is.
What are they?
No more sideline hood for the refs.
What do you mean?
The reviews are handled from the command center in New York.
Stronger enforcement of very egregious hits penalties.
And what is that.
Intentionally violent hits could get you a one game suspension as well as getting ejected from the game.
They should come down harder on dirty hits.
No need for that.
There was talk of only a 10 minute overtime period.
It's designed to reduce the amount of snaps a player takes in a game or sea.
I'm not sure about that.
They tabled it for now.
That's good.
They will be more lenient in touchdown celebrations.
I don't like the celebrations.
I don't either,but the penalties are kind of stupid.
Yea,I agree
