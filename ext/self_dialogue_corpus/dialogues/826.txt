Who do you think will win the NFC East this upcoming season?
I think the Cowboys will repeat.
Really, why do you think that?
Dak Prescott and Ezekial Elliot will only get better in the second year.
I think Philadelphia will surprise.
I doubt it the Cowboys still have a great offensive line.
But the defense stinks you'll see.
Cowboys will go deep into the playoffs.
I think this will be a back to reality year for Dak Prescott.
I thought he looked like the real last year.
Carson Wentz will come on this year the Eagles have upgrades in many positions.
They may do a little better but I still think they do not lead the East.
The wide receivers should be much better this year and I think the defense will improve some.
The cowboys have the new trio Dak, Ezekial, and Dez.
I always thought Dez Bryant was over rated.
He's a good receiver who opens up the field.
The Eagles also drafted a great new DL Darek Barnett.
Don't think he will have a big impact in year one.
He could be the next Reggie White.
We will see.  They never won it all even with Reggie.
