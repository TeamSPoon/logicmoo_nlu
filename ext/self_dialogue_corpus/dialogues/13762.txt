What do you think about Lady Gaga?
Love her.
I feel like it's a while since she's come out with a new song.
What about The Cure?
I didn't even know that was her song.
It. is. Do you like her music?
Yes. I liked Bad Romance a lot.
Yeah, I definitely thought her first album was her best.
The Fame?
Yes.
