Did you see that they released the new Pirates of the Caribbean movie?
I did. I can't wait to see it.
Me either. I have loved all of the other ones.
Is Johnny Depp still playing Jack Sparrow?
He is, and Javier Bardem is in this one as well.
Awesome! I really enjoy his movies.
What is this movie called?
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales. I think it might be the last one.
Bummer! I was hoping they would keep making them.
Yeah, me too. I would probably watch ten more if they made them.
