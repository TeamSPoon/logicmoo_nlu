Speaking of movies, what is your favorite comedy?
I'd have to say I like Caddyshack a lot. Something about Mary is also good.
What about recent comedies? Are there any that you like?
I've seen clips from that Ben Stiller movie about the actors making the Vietnam War movie. I forget what that movie is called.
What about Animal House? Have you seen that movie?
Of course that is considered a classic comedy, but it has been so long since I've seen it, and the jokes are a bit old by now.
Are there any other recent comedies that you like?
I think when they came out I liked those Eddie Murphy cop comedies, but I forget the title.
Who is your favorite comedic actor?
I would say Chevy Chase and Dan Ackroyd may be my favorite comedic actors.
It seems you don't go to the movies very much.
Oh, I want to see that new Will Ferrel comedy about the suburban couple who launch a gambling den in their living room. It looks funny.
Will Ferrel is pretty funny, and he has made quite a few movies.
Yes, I do like many of his films, though some of them are less likeable than others.
Do you ever go to stand-up comedy acts, or watch comedic sitcoms?
I used to like Seinfeld and Married With Children when they originally came out. Seinfeld episodes are still fun to watch, though Married with Children has gotten a bit stale.
Did you see Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure?
No, the whole Bill and Ted bit never appealed to me.
It seems a lot of great comedic actors made a name for themselves on Saturday Night Live.
Of course. And then there is Michael Richards, who was hilarious on the show Fridays.
