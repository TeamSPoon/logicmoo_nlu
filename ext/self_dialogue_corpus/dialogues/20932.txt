Just got done watching some movies from when we were growing up.
Really?  What made you do that.
I was bored, and couldn't find anything on Netflix.
haha, I think we've all been there.  What'd you watch?
I just got done watching Surf Ninjas haha.
Oh man, I haven't even though about that movie in years.
It was so corny.  I can't believe how much I liked that as a kid.
I bet it was, what else did you watch?
Well, I got to Surf Ninjas because I watched 3 ninjas first.
I completely forgot about that movie!
It was just as corny, but so good.
Now you've got me wanting to watch it.
Do it! My wife is getting annoyed because I keep saying "Rocky loves emily"
I forgot about that part too! I wonder if those guys did any other movies.
I looked it up, the kid who played Rocky only did the two 3 ninja movies and was an extra in another movie.
There's another 3 ninjas?
Yeah haha, I haven't watched it but it seems terrible!
No way it's terrible, I'm going to watch it.
I bet it's bad, let me know how it is so I can decide if I want to watch it or not.
I will!
