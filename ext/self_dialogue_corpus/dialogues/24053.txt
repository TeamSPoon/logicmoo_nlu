So what do you think about this summer's movies?
I don't know. A lot of them aren't doing well.
Have you seen any you have liked?
I loved Wonder Woman.
Me , too. I just saw it a second time.
I am looking forward to the new Spiderman Homecoming movie.
I hear the reviews are good for that movie. I want to see Despicable Me 3.
Are you serious?
Totally. I love Minions.
I planning to skip that one but do want to see Transformers The Last night.
I liked the first Transformers movie, but lost interest after that.
What about Cars 3?
I've never seen any of the Cars movies.
They are actually quite good.
I'm looking forward to August when The Dark Tower comes out.
I haven't heard of it.
It's by Stephen King.
Oh I love his movies. He's so good at creeping my out.
Then you may want to see the remake of It that is coming out in September.
I was already planning on it.
