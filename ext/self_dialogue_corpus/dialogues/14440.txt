Who is your favorite to win the finals this year?
I think the Cavaliers will win it all
Really???? I thought you would've been a Warriors fan.  Steph Curry is a beast
Yeah I agree, but I THINK Lebron is too much for them.
Between Curry, Green, and Thompson, the warriors are unstoppable.
Well, that's what alot of people said last year when the Warriors lost.
Yeah, but they didn't have Durant either.  He's going to be the game changer in this series.
Durant is a good addition, but I still think the Cavaliers will win.
I will definitely be a great series whoever wins, don't you agree?
Yes I agree.  If the Cavaliers win this year, Lebron will cement himself in history as one of the greats of all time.
That's true.  Lebron is the best player in the league right now and has been for awhile.
The crazy thing is that he's still got some good years left in him.
That's the advantage he had coming straight outta high school.
I still don't think he will ever be as good as Jordan though.
I don't know about that.  Lebron has already surpassed and broken many of Jordan's records.
But Michael Jordan was one-of-a-kind. Lebron never won a dunk competition, never got defensive player of the year, etc.
There are alot similarities between the two.  They are both astounding players .
Too bad Lebron never went to college. I would have loved to see him play for a college team
Yeah, it would've been nice to see Lebron win a NCAA championship or 2 or 3. lol
At least he has already won 3 NBA championships
