When do you think Rock music began?
Probably sometime in the 1950s.
What artist or band do you think Rock music originated with?
It would have to be Little Richard.
Do you think Little Richard was better than Elvis?
Elvis and Little Richard were both good, they had a lot in common.
Who do you think were the best Rock bands of the 1960s?
I'd have to say The Who, Rolling Stones, or Cream.
Those were great bands, too bad there aren't any bands like that anymore.
It is too bad, today everything is created by studio engineers instead of by the musicians themselves.
