How do you think the Minnesota Vikings will do this year?
I think they will be good, I'm hoping they can make the playoffs.
Me too, although I have learned not to get my hopes too high.
Same. Such is the life of a Vikings fan.
At least we're not the Browns.
True. I have a good feeling about our new rookie RB Dalvin Cook.
Me too, I can't believe he fell to us in the second round. Great value for one of the best backs in the draft.
Rookie of the year, calling it now.
That would make me so happy.
Do you think Teddy Bridgewater will play at all this year?
I don't think he will, but I think he will be healthy enough to play if needed. Sam Bradford will play well and be the starter for the entire season.
Yeah Sam was pretty good for us last year, even though we had a terrible offensive line.
That's why I think we will be improved this year. Adding o line players in free agency will really help our offense out.
It's all about who stays healthy though, we were saying the same thing last year.
Yeah good point. I guess we will just have to see what happens when the season starts.
Have you been to any games at US Bank stadium yet?
Not yet, but I toured it last year. It's incredible
Yep we have one of the best stadiums in the league for sure. Love it
I hope tickets won't be too expensive this year.
Well if they are, it means we are playing well. Good problem to have!
