Do you still follow the bruins
I do they made the playoffs this year
Oh great how did they make out
too bad for them they got knocked out in the first round
ya that's the breaks but they had a decent season overll
I still only like hockey for the fights
I know you do and they are really down
that's probably why I don't watch too much hockey these days
remember the days with the bench clearing brawls
do I ever I look some of them up on youtube to watch
I still remember the big bad bruins when they went in the stands to fight with fans
I recall that too that got ugly quickly
That stuff just doesn't happen any more it's all about the game
Yes the refs really try to keep the fighting down to a minimum
It's good for them just not for fans like you
haha I know but when it comes to the playoffs I watch to sees doing well
Well at least your not a total brut of a fan
When is the next game on tv
Pretty sure its tomorrow night.
O great maybe I'll make an effort to grab a sixey and watch
