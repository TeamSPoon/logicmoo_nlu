What was your favorite thing about The Empire Strikes Back?
There are a lot of wonderful elements to Empire, but my favorite would have to be Yoda.
He's a great character.
My love comes from Frank Oz, who acted and voiced Yoda
Oh, are you a Muppet fan?
From way back. I was thrilled to see a Muppet alumnus enter the Star Wars mythos with a great character.
It was an interesting choice to do Yoda live with a puppeteer.
I think it was brilliant. It gave Mark Hamill a real actor to play off of, and it made Yoda more real to me.
Real for a puppet, you mean.
The Muppets have been real to me forever! I loved that the greatest Jedi Master ever is a little green puppet thing.
