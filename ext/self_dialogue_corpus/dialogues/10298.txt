You know what they need to remake?  Lethal Weapon.
You mean the one from the 80's?
Yeah.  Danny Glover, Mel Gibson, pure classic.
It was kind of one of the original buddy cop movies.
But one of the better ones recently done.
Mel Gibson was crazy in that movie.
It was interesting how they made his character a loose cannon yet but somehow employed.
What do you mean?
You would think any other cop would have been fired long ago.
Well, that is why it's a movie.
