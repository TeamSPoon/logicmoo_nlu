Which of the three Star Trek reboot movies do you think is best?
First one.
Why?
I don't know. I guess it just feels the most cohesive.
I like the third one best, myself.
The third one is fine, but I feel like it's a bit under-cooked.
I feel the same about the second one. That one is very under-cooked.
I think the second one starts out really good actually, a really strong first act.
That doesn't make up for the rest of the movie being bad.
I wouldn't say it's bad. Just messy. The third one is the one I think is boring.
Now you're just being crazy. Don't tell me you prefer Into Darkness over Beyond?
I'd rank them about the same really.
You're crazy. The correct ranking is, 3, 1, 2, in that order.
Mine is 1, with 2 and 3 being more or less equal. My opinion on which is better varies slightly from day to day.
But the second one doesn't even feel like a real Star Trek film though.
Yeah, and the first one felt like a Star Wars film. And I like it, but we can't just judge movies on how they feel to us.
But isn't that what ranking movies is all about? Judging feels based on nothing but personal preference?
I suppose you're right.
Well, at least I can probably agree that none of the reboot films are completely awful.
Yeah, they're not Generations, or worse, V.
