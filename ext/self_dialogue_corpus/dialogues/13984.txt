Did you watch Lady Gaga at the Superbowl?
Yes!  It was can't miss at my house!
I know, my parents didn't understand it but I loved it!
Yeah, I think the message was lost on the older generation.
She looked really great, too.
Yeah, I heard people thought she looked fat.
Are you kidding me?  I'd die to have her body!
I know, they definitely have a warped sense of reality.
She looked great, there was a point where she looked too thin.
I'm glad she looks the way she does.  I love her!
