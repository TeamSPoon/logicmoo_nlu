Did you ever see The Fox and the Hound?
No, when?
It's old, from when we were kids.
What was it about again?
The lady found the baby fox, and he became best friends with the hunting dog!
Oh yeah! Wasn't that a sad movie?
Yeah, when she had to release the fox into the wild it got sad.
I feel like like I cried a little bit haha!
I definitely cried. But it was one of my favorites.
I can understand why.
