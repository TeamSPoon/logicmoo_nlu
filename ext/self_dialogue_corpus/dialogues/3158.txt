Hey, looking forward to the NFL season starting?
Yeah, last year was really good. I'm hoping for more good games this year.
It's tough though, I'm a 49ers fan and it's painful to watch them lately.
Ouch, yeah. They'll pull it together eventually, they always come back around.
Meanwhile I've been enjoying the Patriots a lot. I jumped right on that bandwagon.
Right at the Super Bowl? Man, you couldn't have picked a less likely time.
Nah, I've actually been following them for a couple of seasons, since the 49ers have been sucking.
They've been putting on some great football.
I couldn't believe they pulled out that win at the super bowl though.
Yeah, history making plays right there.
What an upset.
Not as upsetting as the halftime show maybe.
Haha, yeah, but some of it was alright.
I had kind of given up on the game by that point. If it isn't close, I just lose interest.
I was still interested, but it was hurting. After all I've been through with the 49ers the past few years, I didn't want to get crushed so hard again.
It had to be rough for the Falcons and their fans though man, I tell you.
Yeah, it would have been cool to see them win a super bowl there. But I was Patriots all the way.
I didn't have a dog in the fight, so I just wanted a good game. The first half didn't deliver, but that second half had me on the edge of my seat.
Yeah, we probably won't get anything like that this year.
But there could be some really good games regardless. Here's to your 49ers finding their way back to the path of champions.
