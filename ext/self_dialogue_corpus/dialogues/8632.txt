So my dad is listening to lots of The Grateful Dead lately.
Man, they've been around forever.
Yeah, he's a true Deadhead as they call them.
Wasn't the lead singer Jerry Garcia.
Yeah.  He died a while back though.
Who sings for them now?
I'm not really sure.  I know they tour all the time though.
Yeah, and they make a killing doing it too I think.
They've had some of the highest-grossing tours the last ten years.
Guess their fanbase is bigger than I thought.
