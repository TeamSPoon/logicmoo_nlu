You like rap music?
Me? No. I'm about that metal.
Like Warrent and stuff?
More like Dio.
I'm not familiar with this Dio, did you say?
He did that song Holy Diver.
I've heard that before.
Yeah. So much more than that though.
Like what?
He invented the devil horns.
I though Gene Simmons invented that?
So he says, but he's a liar.
Also Dio did this awesome cover of Dream on.
Yeah, I know that one. With the guitar solos.
Yeah, that's yngwe Malmstein. He really ruins it.
I never thought about it that way.
It's a bunch of crappy scales and it doesn't sound in the same key.
Yeah, I uess that's true now that you mention it.
Last in line is a great song. So Egypt (chains are on)
We should hear them right now.
