Who do you think is the best team to never win a Super Bowl.
Definitely the 1998 Minnesota Vikings.
That's what comes to my mind as well. The 1999 Jacksonville Jaguars come to mind as well.
And the 2007 New England Patriots.
Yeah, I forgot all about New England. They've won so much, that I don't really think about them in this category.
True. The 1998 Minnesota Vikings were destined to win and then something happened.
Yeah, Gary Anderson happened.
The dude was perfect all year and missed the biggest kick in Vikings history.
He probably can't sleep till this day. It was only a 40 yarder, in the dome.
So much talent wasted on not winning the Super Bowl. Cunningham, Randy Moss, Cris Carter, Robert Smith. That offense was ridiculous.
Ridiculous was right. Everyone wanted to see the Vikings and Broncos in that Super Bowl.
Everyone, including me. What could have been.
I wonder if Minnesota could have beaten Denver.
They would have put up a better showing than Atlanta. You mentioned the 1999 Jaguars. What happened with them.
They went 14-0 against everyone in the league except the Titans. They went 0-3 against them.
Oh, the Music City Miracle titans. Yes.
They had a pretty solid offense and defense.
I'm trying to think. Brunnell, Fred Taylor, Jimmy Smith.
Yes. Quite a balanced offense. The defense wasn't too bad either.
At least the Titans gave us one of the best Super Bowls that year against the Rams. So, not so disappointed Jacksonville didn't make it.
