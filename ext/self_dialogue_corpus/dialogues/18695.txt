Have you ever thought about what music you'd like played at your funeral or wake?
That's a terribly dark thought to have!
Maybe, but it's something I bet a lot of people have thought about.
I never have. If I'm dead, music is going to be the last thing I worry about.
I think I'd like a lot of really happy music to be played. To cheer people up.
But think about this - What if almost no one shows up? Now it's even sadder, this empty funeral and this really upbeat music playing.
Now who's having dark thoughts? Besides, I still think happy music would be the best thing.
What songs would you pick?
'Happy' by Pharell Williams, for one. 'Don't Worry, Be Happy', for another.
So you're taking the happy thing very literally.
I was mostly joking. But I do think that happy music at a funeral or wake is the way to go.
I think it would be jarring and out of place. If people are feeling very sad, they don't want to hear some peppy, up beat music.
So you'd play depressing music at your funeral, then?
I wouldn't be playing ANY music, because I'd be dead. And I wouldn't plan something like that ahead of time.
Well, you better not let me DJ your wake, because I'd be playing nothing but Beach Boys songs.
I can't believe we're having this conversation.
I've actually never been to a funeral where any music other than maybe religious/classical stuff was being played.
Me neither. Because most people aren't really focused on music at times like those.
Well, they should be!
I don't agree. And I don't think happy music is approriate at a time like that.
