How would you feel about starting a side project?
I might be interested, what are you thinking of?
I think we should do a Queen cover band!
Now THAT is something I'd definitely be interested in!
With your voice range, I think you'd have no trouble hitting Freddie's notes.
Really? You think so?
I know so.
What Queen songs do you think we should start with?
Well, "Bohemian Rhapsody."
Of course, I think people would expect that one.
They would, which is why we should do it.
What other songs do you think would be good?
I think, we should do Fat Bottomed Girls, We Will Rock You, Another One Bites the Dust,...
We have to do Pressure!
Oh for sure, that's one of my all time favorites.
Do we know anyone else who would be interested in joining?
Well, I know Sarah is a hardcore Queen fan.
Yeah, she went to the Adam Lambert tour about 10 time!
haha I know! So she's in for sure!
I bet she can give me some tips on how Adam preformed...
