So, I think I have figured out why in the Harry Potter movies, Snape was so hard on Neville Longbottom.
Because he was pals with Harry?
Not just that, there is way more. He was not as mean to Harry's other pals, at least not as mean as he was to Neville.
Then why?
Because, if Voldermort would have targeted the Longbottoms, his mom and dad, instead of the Potters, Lily might still be alive.
What! Since, either family would fit the criteria to end him.
Yes. So he blamed Harry, and Neville. Neville to a lesser extent.
That is why he always took his points away.
And embarrassed him.  He did not even have the excuse he was trying to convince Voldermort by it either.
Snape was a real piece of work.
