Hi there, do you know anything about dance music?
A little, why?
I'm helping to pick songs for a wedding reception and need ideas.
What do you have so far?
We hired a DJ and need to pick the songs now. I suggested we start with Holiday by Madonna.
Yeah that should get them dancing. What else are you thinking?
We want a mix of styles and periods, and for people to dance.
With a wedding its a mixed group of people.
So for the oldtimers, maybe Its a Wonderful World.
Right! I like that.
And a little Nat King Cole.
Good, good.
Also, Aerosmith, Don't Want to Miss a Thing -another slow, romantic one.
I like that.  And more modern?
I thought maybe one Bruno Mars.
He's romantic.
And then maybe a funny one.
Like what?
When I'm 64, by the Beatles.
That's a sweet touch.
