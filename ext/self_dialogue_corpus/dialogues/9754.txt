what's the album from Drake where he sits on a very tall building?
I think that's photoshop, but I think I know what you're referring to
what is that?
let me give you a hint, he was sitting on the tallest tower in Canada, so he could have a great view of everything down below
oh, it's called the Views
exactly
I love that album so much, I listen to that one a lot last summer
wanna a recommendation of what to listen this summer from him?
fire it up to me
His newest album More Life
