Who is your favorite band of all time?
Oh, definitely thousand foot krutch.
What kind of music is that,  I've never heard of them.
They are awesome,  it's kind of a rap/rock mix. The lead singer is Trevor mcnevan and he's got some pipes.
Who are they similar too?
Umm idk they are pretty unique.  When i based got their CD phenomenon I hadn't heard anything like it before.
Do they play festivals? I'll be at rock on the range this year.
No way,  I'm jealous.  They may be there,  but no matter what check out hands like houses.
Oh yeah I love them.  They are similar to as lions and seconds away.
Yeah I love the alternative rock with the minor tones.
