Do you think football has changed in the past 10 years?
Definitely. The NFL has come a long way to making the game safer for it's players.
Do you think they have added to many rules that it now makes the game boring?
On some things they have, like the celebrations in zone after a touch down.
Your saying it's to controlling?
Of course, players should be allowed to celebrate a touchdown, they work hard to get it.
So, the NFL should allow any celebration the player wants to do?
Well within a respectful way, nothing derogatory to the fans or opposing team.
How do you feel about the red flag Replay system?
The NFL needed this system 20 years ago, it's a plus but can be improved.
How can they improve the redflag system without adding to much time to the game?
They can make it mandatory to use on 4th downs and touchdown disputes.
Do you think technology improves the game?
Yes it does. It can cut down on human error from the officials, they do miss a lot of calls.
If the NFL added more officials on field would that help?
It's a chance that it may work, who knows they should at least try.
How do you feel about the crazy rules when it come to the quarter backs?
The rules and calls are crazy, it's a physical game people get hit, hard.
You feel the quarterback should be free game to get hit?
If a guy 300 plus pounds is in the act of sacking the quarterback they cannot stop themselves from hitting the target.
