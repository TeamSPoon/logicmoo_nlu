Man, I was so tired this morning I almost lost my car!
That reminds me of the movie Dude Where's My Car.
That movie sounds so stupid. What is it about?
It's about what you just said. A guy wakes up delirious and loses his car.
Alright, I will admit that sounds kind of interesting.
It is. It's got everything. Time travel, kidnapping, and bullies.
Those are three of my favorite things in movies.
Me too. You have to have some conflict for a movie to be interesting.
It sounds wacky, but does that plot at least make sense?
It does. While it is childish, there are many life lessons to be learned in Dude Where's My Car
