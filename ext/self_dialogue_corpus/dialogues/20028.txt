Let's talk about music
Sounds good
I like country
Me too
I just heard Carrie underwood on the radio
Heartbeat?
Yes, it's a good song
It's a sweet song
I like Easton corbin
Me too, does he have a new song out?
A girl like you
I think I heard that one
It has a very catchy beat, and just makes you want to sing along
I love songs like that
You'll have to look it up and see if you know that
I'll do that, because I feel like I heard it
It's a good song
I do really like Easton corbin though
He has a good authentic voice
Yes he does.
