So do you like Opera Music?
No I really do not care for it at all.
Well it is not my favorite but some of the Opera singers are good like Luciano Pavoratti.
Yes he is good. But Opera music is still not my thing.
How about Andre Botacelli? He is very good.
Yes he is very good.
Did you know that he is blind?
Yes, I have heard that.
I watched a documentary on him and he was also singing it it, what a voice.
He certainly is one of the great Opera singers.
Yes and to overcome his blindness with that great voice.
He is probably the only one I would actually want to go see.
Yes that would be wonderful. Such a talented man.
I do not care for women opera singers.
I do not either. But Luciano and Andre are great.
Yes they are. I would go see them.
When they come to the Met we can go see them together.
I hope that is soon.
Even though I do not like Opera music, I would go see them.
Yes I would too.
