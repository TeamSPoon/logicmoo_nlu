What's your favorite Disney movie?
That's a hard one. I think I'm going to go with The Lion King.
Why that movie over all the others?
Well, it was my first Disney movie.
That's it?
Of course not. That movie made me really feel for characters in a movie.
Which characters? If I had to guess I'd say Mufasa and Simba.
I'm going to say Simba and Scar.
Why Scar?
I've never hated a fictional character more than Scar for what he did.
