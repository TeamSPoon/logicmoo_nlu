One of my favorite movies is The 40-Year Old Virgin.
That was a star maker for Steve Carell.
The scene where he gets his chest hair pulled off.
That was great.  I think the scene was all real.
It's a funny movie with a heart.
Yes, I like when there is more then just slapstick.
A bit of a buddy movie with his co-workers.
Yes, lets not forget Paul Rudd was in the movie and very funny.
I also like Catherine Keener.  She's a terrific actress.
Yes, I've seen her in several movies.  Always excellent.
