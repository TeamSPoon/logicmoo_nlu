Do you like Diana Ross?
Yes I do. I have a lot of her music in my music library on my phone.
She will be performing at The Mann Music Center in Philadelphia later this summer.
I think I might want to get some tickets to go see her. I have never seen her live in concert before.
Has she released any music lately?
I doubt it. I stlll play songs from her Diana album from the early eighties.
Isn't that the album with I'm Coming Out on it?
I think it is. I like Sweet Hangover.
That's the one where she goes, "...if there's a cure for this, I don't want it, don't want it".
Yeah that's it. I also like Friend to Friend.
Man, Friend to Friend is a sleeper. I played that for my girl one time.
Did she like it?
She didn't know who it was. I told her it was Diana Ross.
What she say?
The same Diana Ross from Motown and the Supremes? I told her, yep, sure enough.
I like her better after she went solo though.
Me too. The Supremes and that Motown sound were just a little bit before my time.
Mine too. But it was all still good music though.
Yeah, Barry Gordy had a music machine back then.
Back then? Still does. I'm sure that music catalog is worth millions if not billions.
