Who do you think is the best player ever?
Hmm, maybe Wilt Chamberlin.
What about Michael Jordan?
Only won six championships.
Wilt wasn't really that great, just really tall.
That's part of basketball, you just gotta score.
Lebron is better than Wilt.
No way, Lebron has lost in the finals a lot.
Yeah, but his teams sucked. Lebron in the early years had terrible teams.
Wilt scored 100 points in a game.
Players today are really more athletic, and defenses are alot better.
Well ok, who do you think is going to win this year?
It's going to be the Cavs, Lebron is the best player in the league right now.
Warriors have 3 of the top 5 players, they'll win.
Lebron can take over a game all by himself.
I think the Warriors will be able to play as a team and outscore Lebron.
Did you see the cavs vs Boston? They dominate them.
Warriors won the most game and are undefeated in the playoffs.
Spurs were beating on them until Kawhai got injured.
I don't know, I still think the Warriors will win
