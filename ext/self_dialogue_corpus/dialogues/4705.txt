Did you see the Tigers play the Rangers last night?
Yeah, too bad they lost.
What was the final score? I didn't see the end of the game.
Rangers beat the TIgers 5-3
Too bad they lost!  Don't they play the Rangers again today?
Yes, at 7:15 tonight.
I'll have to watch that game.  I think next week they play the Astros.
I think so too.  So when I was watching the game the tigers only had 2 runs.  When did they get the third?
They didn't get the third run until the 9th inning.
Too bad they didn't pull it together a little sooner. Tigers usually play pretty well, but this season isn't going so good.
I wish I knew what was holding them back.  They have some great players!
Yeah they do.  I'm a big fan of Verlander.
Oh me too!  He's a favorite but I like Cabrera better.
Wouldn't it be great if they got it together and won the world series?
Yeah it would.  When was the last time they held that title?
I think it was back in 1984.
Wow!  That long ago huh?  I think they've held the World Series title only 4 times.
I think they could do it again.  It wasn't that long ago that it looked like a good possibility that they would go far again.
Well, if they are going to get any title, they need to bring a stronger game.
I agree!
