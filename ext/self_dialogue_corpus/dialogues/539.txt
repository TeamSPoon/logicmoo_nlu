What's your favorite NFL team?
I sort of have two.
Really, who?
The Steelers and Cowboys.
Not my favorites.
Who's yours?
Miami of course.
The Dolphins?
Yes.
That's right, you liked them since Marino was there.
Best Quarterback ever.
He was good.
Too bad Don Shula doesn't coach them anymore.
Yea, maybe they'd win.
They win some. Don't do too bad.
No, they do pretty good I guess.

Defensive End.
