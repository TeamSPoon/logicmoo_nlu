What are your expectation for this coming NFL season?
Well I expect it to be very competitive.
Agreed, there are going to be a lot of teams that'll begin their ascent.
Yes, there are so many young teams that are going to come into their own.
I think the Titans are going to lead the pack among the teams that are going to become contenders.
Yes, Marcus Mariota is the real deal.
I expect him to become a top 3 quarterback eventually, maybe even next season.
He definitely has the skill set to become top 3.
I am calling it, Titans will win over 12 games this season.
You sure are optimistic.
Well I believe in Mariota, I also believe that the Panthers are coming back this season.
Well I think so too, I think they are geared up to do really good.
Yes, Cam has something to prove, he is going to put up some numbers.
He is a MVP, I would not doubt that.
I still think that the Patriots are the favorites to win it all though.
Well that is a popular opinion to have, they are the most consistent team in the league.
Yeah, they would be my bet at Vegas.
Won't win much money, they are odds on favorites.
Well let's hope for some compelling games and intense rivalries.
Yes, let's hope it wont be a Patriots season again.
