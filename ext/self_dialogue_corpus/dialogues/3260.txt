What do you want to watch tonight?
Oh I'm in the mood for monster on the loose.
Great I know a great one. Pumpkin Head.
Sounds good, what's it about?
It's about this guy who's son was killed by some out of towners and he summons a demon from hell to avenge his son's death.
Who is in it?
It's the guy that played the cyborg in Aliens, the one that saves Sigourney Weaver and the little girl.
I don't remember his name but I know who you are talking about.
It's a really good movie and there is no CGI at all.
Sounds good, let's see some revenge!
