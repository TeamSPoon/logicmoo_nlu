Merlin's beard, the Prisoner of Azkaban movie was awful.
Okay, I know you hate it, but can you name ANYTHING you like about it?
Um, okay, David Thewlis and Gary Oldman were amazing, and it was the only movie to get Harry's hair right.
That's it? What about the Marauder's Map?
I would've liked that more if they HADN'T MISSPELLED MOONY. THERE IS NO 'E', THE 'E' DOES NOT EXIST.
Okay, okay, calm down!
HOW CAN I CALM DOWN? HOW CAN THEY MISSPELL A NAME FROM SOMETHING THAT WAS BASED OFF A BOOK!
What made you more upset, the misspelling of Moony or the were-Chihuahua?
Oh, that's tough. I think it's still the misspelling.
I think we'll have to agree to disagree on that one.
