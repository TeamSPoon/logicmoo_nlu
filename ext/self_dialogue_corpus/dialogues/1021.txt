What were the best touchdown dances you have ever seen in NFL history?
Wow, that's a good question. I'm guessing I would have to go back a few years because players can't get too crazy anymore.
Nope. They can't. Chad Johnson really made the NFL crackdown on the extremity of the dances.
Remember the Joe Horn cell phone touchdown celebration?
Yes, that was a Sunday night game, right?
Yes it was. The Saints were atrocious at that time. I believe that was 2003.
That was a ridiculous celebration. Probably one of the most absurd ones I have ever seen.
Absolutely absurd. Another one from the Saints, remember the Leap Frog dance.
That was sometime in the 1990's, right?
I believe it was the early 1990's. I think the Saints were so bad that they even screwed up that celebration.
Wouldn't surprise me. Remember the Chad Johnson golfing celebration?
I do remember that. He got fined for that.
Guess the commissioner didn't like using the pile-on as a prop.
Certainly not. Seems like the wide receivers were always the entertainment divas.
Absolutely. Terrell Owens. He was the diva that got everything started.
His touchdown celebration on the star in Dallas is when things started to accelerate with the celebration stuff.
Seems like it was around that time. Remember his pom-pom cheerleader celebration.
Yes, I definitely remember that. His sharpie autograph celebration was great also.
That guy was definitely a diva.
Chad Johnson definitely followed in his foot steps.
