Hey! What's up?
Nothing much how about you?
Nothing really. I did see a really neat movie though.
Which one?
It's called Moon.
When did that come out?
A while ago but I really liked it.
Was it well rated?
Oh heck yeah everyone really loved it.
I'mma need to check that out!
I can lend you a copy of it if you want.
I would really appreciate that.
Sure!
So what is it about?
It's about a guy who is stuck in a moon base taking care of things.
That sounds really neat.
I can't spoil it for you but I really think that you are ganna like it
How long is it?
It's only about a couple hours, nothing crazy.
I'll watch it this weekend.
