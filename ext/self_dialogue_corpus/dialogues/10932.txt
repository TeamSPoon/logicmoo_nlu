Can you believe the Capitals again lost before getting to the finals?
I do believe it because it happens every year. They looked bad the other night.
Yeah they did. I guess there is a reason the Penguins won the Cup last year.
They'll probably win it again this year if they keep playing like that.
Even with Crosby hurt they have to be considered the favorites. Who do they have next?
They play Ottawa in the East finals.
Oh that's right. And how long has it been since Ottawa went to the Cup finals?
I doubt they ever have. And I don't think a team from Canada has won it all in about 25 years.
Who did it then?
Maybe Montreal in the mid 1990s? I can't remember for sure.
The Canada teams haven't been very good in recent years?
Edmonton seems on the way up at least. They took the Ducks to seven games.
And they have that McDavid kid, who is what? 21?
I think so, and he may already be MVP. They might be getting ready for another Gretzky-type run.
Well I doubt they'll win that many Cups, but I wouldn't be surprised to see them win it all in a few years.
Could you imagine a Nashville-Ottawa finals? I don't think NBC would be thrilled.
Well all of Canada would be tuned it at least. Who are you predicting?
I would like to see Pittsburgh and Anaheim I guess, it seems like more of a true East-West that I like to see.
It's a shame Washington ran into Pittsburgh so early. This could have been their year.
They've been saying that for a decade it seems like.
