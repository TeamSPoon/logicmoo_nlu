Ok, if you have to choose: Notorious B.I.G. or Tupac?
Definitely Tupac.
What? I can't believe that. Why?
California Love and Changes are amazing songs.
I mean that's true.
Who would you pick?
Definitely Notorious B.I.G. I love Juicy and Hypnotize.
That's true. He has some great hits as well.
Okay, but can we agree that East Coast or West Coast, Snoop Doggy Dogg is an amazing 90s rapper?
Oh yeah, I could listen to Gin and Juice all day.
