What's your favorite action movie?
I would have to say The Rock
What did you like about that one?
I thought it was a good mix of action and suspense.
Who was your favorite character?
Definitely Sean Connery's character
And why is that?
He had alot of depth to unravel and he played it so well.
Did you hear about the theory that he was actually his 007 character?
Yes, and frankly, I want to believe that so badly.
