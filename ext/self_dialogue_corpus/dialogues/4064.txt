What's the best thriller movie you've seen in the past few years?
Probably Gone Girl.
Ah! That's a good one.
Yea like everything about that movie was so unexpected.
Yea, like when they did the second half of the movie from the wife's point of view.
I know right?! Like they set up it so that you're convinced that the husband had something to do with the wife's disappearance, like you're so sure of it.
Yea, then they show just how psycho the wife was and how she set the whole thing up.
Such a good twist.
I totally did not see that coming at all.
And the ending was crazy. I feel so bad for the husband.
