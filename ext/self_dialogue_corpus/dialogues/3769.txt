What' the best thriller movie you have seen lately?
That would have to be John Wick: Chapter 2.
Okay, that's a good one, you'd think people would learn and leave John alone.
Yeah, you would, but some guy decides to get John back into the assassin gam and then double crosses him.
ANd I think we all know how that's going to turn out.
Yep, John kills all the bad guy's goons and then takes out the big man himself.
Really, you'd think people would stop underestimating a guy who wiped out all his competitors in one night.
That's was the impossible task VIggo gave him, so he could leave the organization?
That's what it seems to be, wipe out all the competitons top guns and you can leave, that's the deal.
Man, know wonder they nicknamed him the Boogeyman.
