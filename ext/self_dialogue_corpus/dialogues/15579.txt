I've got to be careful when I get my hands on an equalizer.
An "equalizer"? What's that?
It's like a long treble and bass control, usually with about ten to twenty dials or levers for adjusting the sound.
Oh, I've got that on my Mixcraft software. It'll drive you nuts playing with the sound like that.
I'm just AWFUL at it. Every time I try to improve the music I'm listening to, I mess it up.
What exactly are you doing wrong?
Well, when I was trying to make a mixtape for the car years ago, for some reason I turned down most of the mid-range.
Sounded really flat, huh?
Worse than that. Most of the vocals are in the mid-range.
Sounded like they were singing in a big hollow box I bet.
Right. And when I tried to adjust "Norwegian Wood" by the Beatles ... oh, my gosh it was bad.
What were you trying to adjust in the song? I know I'd like to remove some of the lyrics, but that's just me.
I was trying to bring out the Sitar, one of my favorite instruments. I'm not sure exactly what I did.
How'd it sound after you got through with it?
"Norwegian Wood" ended up sounding like "Bavarian Cukoo Clocks", just awful. Just a droning wall of acoustic guitar.
Now I'd really like to hear these versions that you did. Might be a fun hobby.
Actually, I think I did an excellent job on "Land Of 1000 Dances".
Which version? There's probably a dozen of them.
The 1965 Cannibal and the Headhunters version. The one with the "na, na-na-na-naa, na na na naaa" hook.
Oh, I had that on cassette in the car! It got eaten up. That's why I'm 100 percent digital nowadays.
