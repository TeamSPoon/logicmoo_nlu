May I ask a question, Professor?
You just did.
I'll take that as a yes. I wanted to study all music as a music major.
You're not?
No, in theory we only study German composers. Rarely will we look at French, Russian, South American, musicals, or things outside of piano music.
I am aware.
Why do we limit ourselves?
A couple reasons: money and racism.
Really?
Yup. So, back in the mid-20th century, a ton of German immigrants came to America to flee the war and its effects.
So they brought their music?
Not just that, but they're the composers who wrote our first textbooks and taught our first generation of true professional music researchers.
So why racist?
The main Germans of the day were very patriotic about their own music, and hated the French. Most weren't worth of study.
Wow! What about the small scores?
That's just publication issues.
How do you mean?
Do you want to pay $1,000 for a textbook?
No, this $200 over four semesters is already too much.
Well, imagine studying a band piece. It would take up the entire page, and they're recent. So they'd take up a lot of space and aren't in the public domain yet. It would be crazy expensive.
