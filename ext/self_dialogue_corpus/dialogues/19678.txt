Do you like Bleachers?
I don't think I've heard of them.
You definitely have. They're a pop rock group from the US.
I'm going to need more than that.
The lead singer, Jack Antonoff, is from the band Fun!
The guy that dates Lena Dunham?
Yeah, that's the one.
I didn't know he had a band.
Their album, Strange Desires, from 2015 had a few hits.
Really? What were they?
"I Wanna Get Better" and "RollerCoaster" were the two big ones
Oh! You're right, I do know them.
Do you like them?
I do, their stuff is catchy. Why do you ask?
They just released a new album yesterday.
I didn't know that - what's it called.
It's called Gone Now I think.
Is it any good?
I enjoyed it, but I only listed to a few songs. You should check it out.
Oh I definitely will. I need some new summer music!
