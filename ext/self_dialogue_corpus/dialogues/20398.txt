Hey! What do you think is the scariest movie you have ever seen is?
That is a good question. I don't know what about you?
I think the scariest movie I have ever seen is The Shining.
The Shining? Who is in that movie?
It stars Jack Nicholson. It was from the 1980's.
Is that the one that takes place in the hotel and the husband goes kind of crazy.
Yeah! He and his family are taking care of the hotel during the winter season.
I have heard that movie is very scary.
It is! I had nightmares about it many times after the first time I saw it.
Wow then it must be very scary.
It is!
Alright, I figured out what the scariest movie I have ever seen is.
What is it?
I have to go with Panic Room.
I don't think I have ever seen that. What is it about?
It is about a woman and her daughter her move into a house that has a "panic room" that you can hide in and it is built so that nobody can ever get into it and you are safe.
Oh cool. What happens next?
An intruder comes into the house and they run in the panic room but they had just moved in so the police system is not set up yet and they have to try to get help somehow.
Wow! Sounds good. Who is in it?
Jodie Foster.
