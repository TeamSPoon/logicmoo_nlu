I can't get that song "Let it Go" out of my head, and the movie Frozen came out years ago!
Maybe by the time the new one comes out you will have a new song in your head!
I wasn't even a big fan of the movie.  It definitely wasn't my favorite Disney movie.
It wasn't my favorite, but I did not see the plot twist with Hans coming.
I totally thought he was a good guy the whole time!  I loved Kristoff though so I'm not mad.
Olaf was pretty cute too.  His song made me crack up.
He had some of the best lines in the movie!
I did love the song with the rock trolls though, it was pretty cute.
That scene was great!  But I would feel totally awkward if that was me.
But it was totally funny. And super catchy.
