I can't believe that there is going to be a toy story 4 movie.
Oh really?
Yes, Pixar is already working on it.
I can't wait, i loved the last one.
I know, it was awesome, but i don't really like how long these movies take to be released.
I totally agree with you there.
Do you think that we will be seeing the same characters again?
I hope so, it wouldn't be the same without them. I can't imagine a toy story without Woody & Buzz
Well, i guess we will wait a couple of years to find out.
It's going to be all worth it, believe me.
