How bad is the slide rule in your view?
I saw Maddon is mad about it.
Yeah he thinks its killing the game.
I have a problem with guys going out of their way.
Yeah thats not baseball
But if a guy is in the path and legit taking a guy out, then thats that.
So you think a guy should be able to slide into another player?
Yeah I would not have issue with a guy taking another guy out
As long as he is in the path he was running in?
Yes.
OK i agree somewhat.
The game isnt that bad, I hate not being able to run into the catcher.
Well the problem is the whole concussion thing.
How many plays at the plate are there in the game though?
Yeah but you have to look out for your players
I think they are making an issue out of nothing
I wouldnt say out of nothing
I just dont see how its a big deal
Someone will get their spine serrated and youll feel otherwise
I do not think that will ever happen
