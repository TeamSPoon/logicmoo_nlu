What is your favorite instrument?
I like guitar.
I am a guitar fan as well.
I like any good guitar in classic or newer rock and roll.
Me too.
Who are some of your favorite players?
Angus Young and Jimmy Hendrix.
Those two come to mind for me as well.
Anyone else you like?
I am a huge Eric Clapton fan.
I forgot about him.
Yea, he can really play.
Those guys must have to practice a ton.
I bet they do.
Have you ever played guitar yourself?
Nope I never have.
I tried it for a while.
What made you stop?
It is very challenging.
I suppose that makes you appreciate the great players even more.
