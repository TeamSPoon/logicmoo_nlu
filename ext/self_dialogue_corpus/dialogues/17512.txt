Have you heard Colton Dixon's new song?
Which one? He is one of my favorite Christian singers!
His song is called All That Matters. It really has some beautiful lyrics.
I will have to check it out. I don't think I have heard that one.
His song really speaks to my heart. I have it set to repeat on my Iphone.
I do that all the time with my favorite songs! I play them until I don't want to hear them anymore.
I know, right? I have a shower playlist too and his song is the first one on my list.
That's a good way to start the morning. You can get your mind set for the day.
Yes! His lyrics remind me that no matter what disasters come my way, God can undo them all!
That's what I am talking about. I sure love his singing...and his hair.
His hair is definitely not what I expected. It's a little wild, but I like that he is different.
Yeah, I think he appeals to a lot more people because his look and sound are so modern.
I started following him on Facebook. I'm totally not stalking him!
Did you? I will have to look him up on there. I hadn't thought about that.
Yeah, I think he just got married. I saw some pics of him and his wife with the Disney bride/groom ears.
Is she pretty?
She was actually! They looked really happy together.
Well, I guess I know what I'm fixing to do.
What's that?
I'm going to be nosy and look at his pictures on Facebook and listen to that new song.
