I love Bruce Springsteen.
I cannot stand Bruce Springsteen!
What? Why? How? He is like iconic.
I think he is overrated.
Wow! I am shocked to hear you say that.
Well my biggest issue is his voice stinks. It is so raspy.
I think it gives his music character.
Well it hurts my ears to be honest.
You may be in a minority though. Many like him.
That's okay we all have different tastes. A great voice is Michael Buble.
Sure his voice is amazing, but he is kind of like a crooner like Frank Sinatra.
Yes, but more modern. His voice is so smooth whereas Springsteen's is like a bumpy roller coaster.
That is too funny. Maybe I just like his melodies so I don't really pay attention to his voice much.
Well all I hear is the rasp when he sings.
Well it is a trademark I guess kind of like Stevie Nicks of Fleetwood Mac.
I don't like Fleetwood Mac either.
Because of her raspy voice?
Yes that is part of it, but I don't like their music.
Well we are all entitled to our opinions.
Yes, good things there are many music groups we have to choose from.
