I watched Seven for the first time last night.
How did you like it?
It was really intense. Especially the ending.
It is a big twist.
It has such a great cast, too!
It's been a long time since I've seen it. Who is in it again?
Morgan Freeman, Brad Pitt, and Kevin Spacey.
Oh, yeah. I remember Kevin Spacey's character really well.
He was so creepy in that movie!
In the best possible way.
