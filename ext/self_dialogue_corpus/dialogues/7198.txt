Have you seen Moana yet?
No, I haven't had a chance to. Should I?
Yes! You would love Moana and Maui. Heihei and Pua are cute, too.
I have heard some of the music, and I like the songs.
"How Far I'll Go" is one of my favorite Disney songs now.
I like that one, too, as well as "You're Welcome."
It's a really pretty movie, too, the water and the beach are amazing looking.
Well, I always like Disney movies with pretty scenes and good music.
I think you'll love it, then.
I will definitely watch it!
