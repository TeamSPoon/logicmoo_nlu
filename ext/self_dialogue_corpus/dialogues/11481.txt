Who is your favorite Beatle?
Would have to be George Harrison.
Why George and not Paul, Ringo or John?
George has such a vibrant personality.
What is you favorite Beatle song?
I would say "I wanna hold your hand."
How about a second favorite.
Next choice would be "Love, love me do."
Did you like their early work or their later work better.
I am a big fan of their early work.
