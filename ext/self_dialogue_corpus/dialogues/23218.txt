Yo you got to check out that new Marvel movie
Which Marvel movie you talking about
The new Wolverine Marvel movie I forgot the name
Oh I know what you talking about the Logan one
That's what it's called Logan
Yeah I remember that one where they actually found Logan's daughter
Yep that's the one so you saw it already
No I only saw the preview online in like on the movie theater by never seen the movie
It has some pretty good fight scenes in there till his daughter gets good
Don't tell me too much you'll spoil the movie for me
I want to tell you too much but know how they say Wolverine can never die
Okay just seeing too much
The Wolverine dies at the end
Why would you tell me that now I don't want to see the movie
Because the movie wasn't all that great anyway
Why did you just say was a good movie
See if you like Marvel
Like Marvin Lewis Marvel movies coming out so much
I know right there's like a Marvel movie every 3 months
Don't you think you had enough superhero Marvel movies
