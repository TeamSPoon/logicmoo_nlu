Who wins the Super bowl this year?
Can you really count the Pats out?
they cant win it every year
Oh but they can.
I think the Falcons go back to the Super Bowl
No way they are going to have a down year dealing with injuries I bet
So who in the NFC then can challenge them
I hate to say it but Dallas.
Are you betting on Prescott having a huge year again?
Yeah I think he will, theres no pressure for him.
So then go to the AFC
The Pats until Brady retires.
OK but outside of that, dont you think a team like Pittsburgh could challenge?
They will but I worry about Ben's health year in and year out.
What about the Chiefs?
They will be hampered by the Maclin release.
I think they have a good offense either way, Kelce is a bigger threat.
The Titans might make the jump this year.
I dont think they are quite ready yet.
So really its the Patriots and no one else in the AFC!
