I can't believe that the Rangers lost in the playoffs again.
I know it's so frustrating being a Rangers fan.
They have a lot of important decisions to make in the off season.
I know where do they even start
Well the goaltender position seems like the only one that is safe.
I'm not that convinced Lunquist is that great anymore.
Oh come on, he's the one consistent player on this team.
He is getting older and gave up some crucial goals though out the year.
Well I think it's the guys in front of him. The defense let's him down to much.
I know the defense is getting older too.
But The whole team needs to get younger .
I agree they did look a little old at times this year. They need to start playing the younger guys more.
Really, Vesey and JT Miller could have made a difference if given more ice time
I know it seems like every time they got going they would go back to the older guys.
I think it starts at top the coach hasn't really gotten this team going.
Yeah sometimes they look so slow and disinterested.
That's where we need to start.
Maybe we can Get a coach who can motivate these guys.
It's going to be an interesting off season .
I know, we need to start with the coach , then start getting some young players in here.
