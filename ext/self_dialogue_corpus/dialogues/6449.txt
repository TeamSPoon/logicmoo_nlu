Did you see the live-action version of Beauty and the Beast?
Yes, I did. Emma Watson was good in it.
I didn't expect much from Emma Watson after the Harry Potter movies ended.
She did a very good job.
Did you like it compared to the animated version from the '90s?
It was too different to compare easily. I liked both in different ways.
Did you have a favourite part?
I loved the scene where the villagers fight all the people who were turned into household objects.
I liked that too, you don't often see funny fight scenes.
It was very well done. Action scenes can be very boring but this one worked.
