Do you know if Nelly is still producing music?
Nelly, the rapper. Or Nelly Furtado, the female artist?
Nelly, the rapper dude.
Oh, I'm not sure. I haven't heard anything from him recently.
I'm sure he still is even though he doesn't seem to be very popular.
I only remember a few of his songs from the early 2000s.
Which ones stick out in your mind?
Oh, I don't know. E.I. and Hot in Here.
Yeah, those were some of his more popular songs.
I don't know too many of his songs besides that. His music just screams early 2000s.
That's why I was asking. It seems as if he hasn't had any major hits since the early 2000s.
I don't think he has either. I was really confused when Nellie Furtado came on the scene.
How so?
I heard the name Nellie Furtado being thrown around and had no idea she was a female singer and was different from Nelly the rapper.
So you thought that Nelly just changed his stage name to Nellie Furtado?
Yes, that's exactly what I thought. Kind of like some other artists.
Sort of like Puff Daddy changing his name to P-Diddy?
Yes, just like that.
Always weird when artists do that. Sometimes it seems as if it is just a marketing scheme to sell more records.
Can't blame them though. It's a brutal business out there to sell hits and make a living.
