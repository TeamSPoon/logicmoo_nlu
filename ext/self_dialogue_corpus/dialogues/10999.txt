Did you watch the Minnesota Wild yesterday?
I did, had some beer while I was watching. Did you?
Yes! I'm so glad they won. It's been a long time.
It has. They seem to be coming back strong this season.
Are you going to watch them next week?
Definitely. Maybe I'll go to your house and drink your beer, haha.
Very funny. Last time you drank all of it. Who's your favorite on the Wild, currently?
Brodin. You?
It's hard to say. I really like Brodin, I really like Eriksson Ek, too.
Me too. I don't really watch any other sports, honestly.
Neither do I. I'll even watch college ice hockey.
Same here.
Do you ever cheer for any other teams?
I still watch the Vancouver Canucks sometimes; I used to watch them when I lived in Washington.
How are they doing this season? I still watch the Boston Bruins sometimes; my son does, too.
The Canucks have kind of lost their touch, I'm afraid. The Wild's more fun to watch anymore.
That's too bad. At least we've both got the Wild, right?
Definitely. Are you coming over later to watch the next game?
I am. Here's to the Wild winning.
Cheers.
