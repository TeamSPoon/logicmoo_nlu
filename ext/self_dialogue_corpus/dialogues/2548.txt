What is the history of the Pittsburg Steelers?
That's a pretty interesting story!
Please tell me.
The founder of the team was Art Rooney.
When was that?
In 1921, Art Rooney started the Hope-Harvey football team. It was a semi-professional team in Pittsburg.
What happened next?
The team got a sponsorship from Loeffler's Electronic Store. That store had a popular product called the Majestic radio.
So, the team became the Majestic Radios?
Yes, and that agreement lasted until 1931.
What happened in 1931?
In order to promote his brother's political aspirations, Art Rooney changed the name of the team to the J. P. Rooneys.
Wow, these are strange names!
I agree, but it was a pretty common practice during the early days of the NFL.
How did they become the Steelers?
Art Rooney was determined to get into the NFL. He first succeeded as the Pittsburg Pirates.
When did that team change their name?
They became the Steelers in 1940.
That's an amazing story!
It is. But, even more amazing, is that there was a time when Art Rooney was a football player, coach, and manager all at once!
