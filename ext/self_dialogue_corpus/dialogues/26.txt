Did you see The Dark Knight?
Yes
The Joker was super crazy in it
Heath Ledger was the best joker
It was silly that he robbed a bank and the next minute was burning the money
The boat scene was cool
That was a messed up situation
I liked two face also
Two face was a good looking guy on his good side
I liked the hospital scene
