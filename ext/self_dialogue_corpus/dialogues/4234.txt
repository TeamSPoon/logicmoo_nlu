What is your favorite thriller movie?
Probably, Snake Eyes, with Nicholas Cage.
Is that the one about the boxing match in Atlantic City?
Yeah that's it. Nicholas Cage plays a corrupt Atlantic City cop and he gets caught up in an assassination.
I like Nicholas Cage a lot. He's been in a lot of thrillers.
Have you seen him in 8mm?
Yes, that movie was super creepy.
I think so too. I definitely didn't see that ending coming!
I know, he made it really believable too!
Nicholas Cage is just a great actor. He's so intense, he really draws you in.
