I just watched Superbowl III.
The first AFL superbowl victory.
Yes, with Willie Joe Namath.
The only Superbowl the Jets won.
Joe Namath predicted a victory.
Yes, where was he?
The Miami Touchdown Club.
How did the scoring go?
The Jets scored a touchdown in the second quarter.
What was the score at halftime?
7-0, Jets.
Who was in the halftime show?
The Florida A&M University Band.
Not like the extravaganzas of today.
Not at all.
Who announced it?
Curt Gowdy.
What happened in the rest of the game?
The Jets scored three more field goals, and the Colts had one touchdown.
And the AFL finally established parity.
