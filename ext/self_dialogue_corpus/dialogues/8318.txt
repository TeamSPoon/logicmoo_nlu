demi lovato's lyrics are so bad!
wow, yikes...
they are! and it's sad, because she's the former disney princess with the best vocals
her lyrics aren't that bad...
she once said "bounce like a basketball" unironically in song. so.
okay, she did that...once
i'm just saying. she might not be as bad as miley, but she's up there
come on! you can't compare demi to that wreckingball
i can and i will!
she's still a better singer than selena, i don't care
