Remember Todd Marinovich?
Yeah he was the USC quarterback that the Raiders drafted
He had a lot of drug problems
Yeah he had a promising career ahead of him
Well hes in the news lately
I heard he got arrested naked recently
Yeah he wants to comeback and play football
OK he has to be almost fifty
Yeah he is I dont think it will happen
I thought he was going to be a great quarterback in the NFL.
Outside of just the drug problem a ton of quarterbacks bust.
Yeah you know who else busted hard?
JaMarcus Russell.
Yes I was going to say him.
Its hard to project the position going from the college sport to the pro one.
Why do you think that is?
Because the games are so different
You still just throw the pigskin
But the spread of the players
I still think its basic elements in both sports.
