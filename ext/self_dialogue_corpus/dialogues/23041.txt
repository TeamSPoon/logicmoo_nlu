Do you like Disney movies?
Nope.
Why not?
Because I'm fifty years old.
So why does that matter?
Disney movies are for kids.
They're still good.
Mostly garbage.
Why would you say that?
It's basically the same story every time.
I can't argue with that but what about the animation.
It used to be good. Now it's just a factory.
What do you mean?
They just pump those movies out non-stop. I can't even keep up.
I like having more options.
I think it takes away from the focus.
Well to each their own I suppose.
My own is not Disney.
Well we both agree that Kevin Smith movie are good.
That's true.
