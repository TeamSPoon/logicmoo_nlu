Have ever seen any of the Star Wars movies?
Are you kidding me?! I am a huge fan of a Star Wars saga.
Did you know that a new movie Star Wars: The Last Jedi is coming out soon? I am not going to miss it.
Really? Nice! What is the planned release date?
December 2017, according to Disney. Remember that character Jyn Erso from the "The Rouge One" episode? She is going to finally start her Jedi training.
Wow, that is actually how the last episode ended. I am pretty sure this one will be awesome just like the other ones.
Yeah, I really liked how they introduced new story lines and characters into the saga.
It really amazes me how they can keep it coming for so many years. Although I am a grown man, I really enjoyed those animated series Star Wars: The Clone Wars. Did you watch those?
Yes, sure. We watched it together with my son. I hope there will be more episodes coming in the future and it will never end...
Agree, I would not want it to end ever! Such a fascinating story!
