I can't watch "Ratatouille" anymore.
Why not? Did you not like it?
No, on the contrary it was awesome.
Then, what's the problem?
To be frank the movie makes me hungry.
That's hilarious, man.
It is not! The movie makes me hungry, that rat can cook!
Never have I ever heard a weirder sentence. "That rat can cook..."
He can! I would eat that food it looks so good.
I don't know if I would eat what a rat cooked but it the food did look good.
