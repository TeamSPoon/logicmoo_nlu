I finally watched Fantasia
Dude where have you been?  That movie is so old.
I never really knew about it.
Why not?  Did you live under a rock as a kid?
No We just weren't really into Disney back then.  I did think it was cool to see Micky Mouse as the sorcerer.
Yeah that was pretty cool.  I like the ballerina hippos.
Didn't it have like a trippy vibe to it though?
Yeah like you Alice in Wonderland type vibe you mean?
Yes just like that.  Just weird things that don't happen normally.
I think it was because they were trying to give sound a visual.  I think the music was written first then they drew the movie to fit.
