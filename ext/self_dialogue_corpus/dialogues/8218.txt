Have you heard any great dance songs lately?
There is this one new song I like a lot.
Who is it by?
Disciples, it's called On My Mind.
I'm not sure if I have heard that one yet.
It is a jam, it is the perfect dance song.
I like that, is it electro or house.
It has the great sounding instrumentals of those genres but has great lyrics as well.
Wow that sounds like a great song.
It is a jam, its perfect to dance to.
