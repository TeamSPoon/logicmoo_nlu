Did you see the interview with Tom Brady about how long he wants to play in the NFL?
No I didn't see that.  What did he say?
He wants to play until he is 45.  He is in great shape.
Wow, that is a long career.
I bet he will break a lot of records if he plays that long.
I would think so.  I bet Brett Favre and Peyton Manning are nervous!
Well they should be.  Brady is still in top shape!
What did you think of their Super Bowl comeback?
It was amazing.  I think Atlanta just ran out of gas.
Yes the Patriots played fast in the 2nd half and the Falcons got gassed.
Is there a certain NFL team that you like?
I really like the Indianapolis Colts.
I like Andrew Luck.  He's been a bit inconsistent as of late though.
Yes he might have been battling some injuries the last few seasons.
Well the Colts defense hasn't helped him either.
They have been historically bad.  Even when Manning was there they just tried and outscored the other team.
I bet Manning would have won a few more Super Bowls with a better defense.
Yes for sure.  They had no problem scoring.
The rules seem to favor the offenses in the NFL too so that doesn't help when your defense is bad.
That is so true.  Defenders have to be very cautious with how they tackle and push other players.
