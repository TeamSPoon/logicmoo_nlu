Have you seen any of the X-Men movies?
No but I want to.
You have to dude they have all the characters you come to know from the comics and cartoons we used to watch.
Alright, watch them with me this weekend?
Count me in.
Awesome, is Wolverine in it?
You serious?  Of course he is.
Now i'm a lot more excited.
They even made movies just about Wolverine.
Really, we're watching those too then.
