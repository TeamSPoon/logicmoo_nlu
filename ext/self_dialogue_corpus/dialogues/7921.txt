Do you like any of Miley Cyrus's music?
It's really hit or miss for me.
I think she has a great voice.
She does have a really strong voice. Some of her songs annoy me, though.
Which ones didn't you like?
It was really only "Wrecking Ball". I really dislike that song.
That's not my favorite, either. Which one is your favorite?
I always loved "Party in the USA". I thought it was so catchy.
Have you heard her new song "Malibu"?
I haven't but I saw she made a video for it. I will give it a listen.
