So, what do you think of the new furious movie, the Fate of the Furious?
I watched it in the theaters the other day and it is by far one of my favorites!
Mine as well. My friends and I watched it just the other day. I can never get enough of Dom and Hobbs.
Oh! And I can't believe they brought Deckard back.
Lord, I could never imagine that he could be portrayed as a good guy.
He actually saved Dom's son. The interaction with him and the baby was hilarious.
The Fate of the Furious was not only great action, but great comedy as well.
All around balanced. I do hope they make more movies in the Furious Franchise, I love to see more of Dom, Letty and Hobbs and maybe more of Deckard as well.
i'm sure there will be more to come. They do have a new story to tell after all. Dom's son.
cheers!
