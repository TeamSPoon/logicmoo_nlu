So, okay, I'm back. Night at the Opera was... interesting, so I guess I'll ask you about Hitchcock.
There are four supposed go-to classics here: Vertigo, North by Northwest, Rear Window, and Psycho. All are good, but go with Psycho.
Okay, yeah, sure. That makes sense... but, let me brace myself here... why?
It changed the way that movies are made. Before Psycho, movies were made with the assumption that people would wander in and out of the theater, so they had to be able to pick it up at any point and follow it.
Seriously? I... guess that would explain a few things, though.
Yeah, totally. So Psycho had a whole publicity campaign where they wouldn't let people in after the movie started, in case they got confused by the story structure.
So, it's a weird structure?
By today's standards, maybe not so much. But, for 1960 it was a total shocker.
Is this some Inception stuff?
No. It's just... don't get too attached to anyone.
