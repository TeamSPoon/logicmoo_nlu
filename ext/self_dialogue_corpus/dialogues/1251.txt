Can anyone beat the Patriots this season?
It's rare for a team that's so strong on paper to win the Super Bowl, so we'll see.
They added so many good pieces to an already great lineup!
Yeah, they're a lock for the playoffs every year as it is given the perennial weak teams in the AFC East.
And now they have Brandin Cooks, Rex Burkhead, and Mike Gillislee as more pieces to that elite offense.
Brady's gonna have a hard time messing that up - 40 years old or not.
Plus, the defense is improved too. They signed Stephon Gilmore and David Harris.
Kony Ealy, too. There aren't many weaknesses on this team, that's for sure.
It makes me wonder if the Pats do win it all, will Brady hang it up?
It would give him and Belichick six Super Bowls apiece, best duo of all-time.
They sealed their places in NFL immortality with that crazy overtime win in last year's Super Bowl.
No doubt. Others may have had better stats, like Peyton Manning, but give me Brady in a big game.
Seeing the Pats make all these moves during the offseason makes me wonder if they're going all-in this season.
Well they have Jimmy Garoppolo waiting in the wings and he can probably lead the team at this point.
Especially with the talent up and down the roster.
He's a free agent after this season, isn't he?
Yes, and I have to think that he'll be highly coveted if he enters free agency.
Would the Patriots put the franchise tag on him?
Only if Brady retires.
But he says he'll play until he's 45, it will be fun to watch.
