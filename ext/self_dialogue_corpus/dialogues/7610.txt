What did you think of the final scene of the last Harry Potter movie?
It makes me cry every time. Especially when Harry is walking to the forest and all of his loved ones who've passed away come back to be with him.
Same! What do you think about the part when he sees Dumbledore at the place that looks like Kings Cross Station?
I wasn't sure what to make of it. I didn't really understand it. Did you?
I think that the dead thing in the station with them is a representation of the Horcrux that was living inside of Harry.
What do you mean by a Horcrux?
A Horcrux is made when somebody splits their soul into different parts, hopefully giving them immortal life. Voldemort split his soul into 7 parts, and one lived inside Harry, so Harry had to die for Voldemort to die too.
Oh, I see now. So that dead thing is the Horcrux which actually did die, but Harry survived?
Yes. Voldemort didn't know that he had put a Horcrux into Harry though, it was an accident when he killed James and Lily Potter.
Wow! There's so much more that happened than I realized. I really need to read the books.
