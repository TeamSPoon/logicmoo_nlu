Whenever I play games, I like to listen to my own music.
It seems music might seem distracting for certain games.
You might think so, but it personally helps me focus. I only listen to underground music.
I wonder if I just haven't found the right gaming music.
Try Aphex Twin. There are not really words, but it might give you an energy boost while you play.
I've never listened to them. I will look it up on Spotify.
You should also add Squarepusher. It's a similar vibe.
Do you have a Spotify? Maybe I could view your playlists.
No, I don't.
Then how do you listen to music?
I own all my music. I have a terabyte hard drive designated specifically for my music.
Wow, a full terabyte?
I think it's even time to consider getting an additional hard drive. I don't want to wait until it's completely full.
Did you purchase all that music?
Well, some of it.
What do you mean?
I have bought some CDs at thrift stores, but most of the music I own is torrented.
Are you telling me that none of the artists you listen to actually receive your monetary support?
I never thought about it that way.
No wonder all the music you listen to is underground. They just don't have paying listeners.
