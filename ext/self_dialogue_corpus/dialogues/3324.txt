Did you think Hellraiser was a good film?
Yes and no.
Whys that?
I like films with killers that could be legitimate.
So you think the main actor was too fictitious?
Yeah and that made the movie seem out of touch
Well all horror films are mostly out of touch so to speak.
They are but this was fake-ish in my mind.
I agree that you could say that but its what the genre is about
The guy almost looked like he was a robot in most of the film.
