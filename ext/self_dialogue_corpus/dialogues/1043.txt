Are you looking forward to this upcoming NFL season?
Are you kidding me, I've been counting down the days.
So have I, I feel it, the Steelers are winning it all this year.
No way, this year belongs to the Broncos, we're gonna make a comeback.
Not without a star quarterback your not.
Doesn't matter our defense will dominate.
It is a passing league now, no way you can score enough.
Well, we're just going to have to see.
My Steelers are built all around this year, we got some great talent.
Well to be honest I think the Steelers aren't going to win more than 9 next season, I just don't see it.
Get ready to be proved wrong, we're going to dominate the league.
Want to make a bet?
Yeah, I am down.
Okay 100 dollars for the team with the most wins, your Steelers versus my Broncos.
Deal, you should just pay up now.
Don't get ahead of yourself, you will regret it.
All good man, I know your nervous.
Yeah, yeah, we'll lets hope both teams do good so we get some good football too.
Of course, but I'm winning that 100 dollars.
Good luck with that.
