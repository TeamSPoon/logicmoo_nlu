I wonder what Gaga's next era is going to be. What kind of sound her album will have.
I'm hoping she touches back on some dance-pop stuff. She's so good at it.
Yeah, me too. I get she need to make an album like Joanne, it was good she had the chance. But it just didn't seem to click together.
Like something was missing?
I don't know. It just didn't seem like a right fit? But a few of her songs do sound very good. But it's like she's a bit lost on her direction.
Oh right, cause she had that Jazz and Frank Sinatra era.
Did you hear she's going to be back on American Horror Story?
I didn't! That makes sense, they'd be stupid to not offer her another role. She killed it the last time and won an award for it.
Exactly. I wonder what character is going to be, if it's another main character.
I don't know, I haven't anything. Did they say what the season's theme was?
