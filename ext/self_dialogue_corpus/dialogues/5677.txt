Did you grow up on Disney movies?
Sure. I'm from the olden time when there were no movies on video or DVD, so the only way to see a movie was in theaters.
Yeah, going to the movies was a much bigger deal back then, more special.
I grew up in a big family, so we hardly ever went to walk-in theaters, too expensive. We did the drive-in movie thing.
I'm from that time also. I think I saw every Disney movie there was, in a drive in theater.
I remember we would make tons of popcorn, put it in paper shopping bags (remember those?) and take them to the drive in to munch on during the movie.
Do you remember any particular movie experience?
There was this live-action movie, In Search of the Castaways, from 1962. I went with my best friend, and my sis and her bestie.
I think I remember that one. Maurice Chevalier was in it.
I liked it because my mom always told me I looked like Hayley Mills when I was a little girl. So it's one of my favorite Disney movies.
