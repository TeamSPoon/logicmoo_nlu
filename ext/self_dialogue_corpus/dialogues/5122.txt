I can't believe how many injuries the Mets have had this year.
Yeah, they've really had terrible luck
I don't think it's luck, I think there's something wrong with their medical staff.
Flores had a leg infection and Duda hurt his elbow. How can you blame that on the trainers?
Well, I still remember Ryan Church flying back to New York with a concussion
That was fifteen years ago.
You have to admit there's something wrong there.
I don't think so. Every team has injuries.
I guess, but it seems like their window is closing.
They've still got Syndergaard and deGrom under control for a few more years.
Ok, but they need to be thinking about how to win now, especially with their injuries.
Who is out there that they can get?
I don't know. I really think they should get a catcher.
Yeah, d'Arnaud is awful and he can't stay on the field.
Maybe Lucroy will get traded again.
I doubt it. I think Texas will be good this year.
Also I'm worried about their bullpen without Famllia.
I think Reed is a good enough closer.
But other than him, they're all terrible
Blevins is pretty good.
