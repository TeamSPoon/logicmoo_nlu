Which is why some people are claiming Jar Jar is Plagueis/Hadu who trained Snoke.
This is insane. Some people literally have way too much time on their hands.
Well, it's an interesting theory. While Jar Jar was ostracized from Gungan and fled to Naboo, he befriends a kid who has a scar on his face from his jaw all the way up to his scalp.
Whoa dude. That's just like Snoke...
Yes. and Jar Jar promises to teach the kid saying "My teachin yousa, pallo. Wesa maken the whole galaxy smilin, huh?"
That story line needed to be followed up on.
Yep, but they never did. And it was left out in a limbo, but was it?
Maybe as a hint. You know, to make people go crazy making these stupid conspiracy theories.
And we do have some crazy theories all over the internet about it
Some guy at reddit had this one post claiming Jar Jar IS Snoke. i didn't believe it though. But it was documented so thoroughly. it was hilarious.
