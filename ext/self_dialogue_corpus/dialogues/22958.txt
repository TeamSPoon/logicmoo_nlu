Do you want to go see the new spider man movie?
I didn't know there was a new spider man movie.
Yes, it comes out on Friday!
Is it with that same guy?
No they have a new actor playing the superhero.
Who is it?
Tom Holland... I believe it's his first big film.
I don't know of him, but i'm happy they are starting the franchise over with someone new.
He seems to be a good fit and that's part of the reason I want to see the movie.
Okay, I'll go with you.
I think you'll enjoy it. Rumor has it that Tom Holland is going to become a really famous actor.
Really? That's exciting... I wonder what he will do next.
He just signed on to the upcoming Uncharted movie.
I love those video games... and I hope he can make a video game adapation finally work in holleywood.
Of course he will also reprise his role as spider man in upcoming films.
You're getting me excited about this movie and I don't know much about it!
I suppose we will find out more on Friday! I've been trying to avoid any spoilers!
I hate spoilers... movie trailers are giving away too much info these days.
That's so true! Okay, we'll lets plan on going this weekend!
Sounds good to me!
