I feel like an old person when I listen to the radio.
Why?
Because I think thoughts like "This isn't music. In my day, we had the real music."
Yeah. I can relate. You are having a "get off my lawn" moment.
Yes. I do honestly feel like music was much better a couple decades ago, but maybe I am crazy.
Maybe everybody feels this way.
My parents definitely said it to me.
Yeah. Mine as well.
I liked my parents music very much, though.
What kind of stuff did they listen to?
A lot of mellow stuff that might be considered cheesy by some, but I grew up listening to it, so I love it.
Like what?
I love, love, love The Carpenters. My mom liked them.
Karen Carpenter had the voice of an angel.
Agreed. Her voice and they lyrics. Top notch stuff. Also, my mom had a lot of Simon and Garfunkel albums which I deeply love.
Oh yeah. They wrote many good tunes.
We had a lot of bad pop music back when I was a kid in the eighties, you know, but there just seemed to be far more variety on the radio.
Yeah. You could hear r&b, rap, heavy metal and pop all on the same station.
Totally. I miss that.
There are still many great artists making music, you just have to search for them. Radio has gotten pretty bad.
