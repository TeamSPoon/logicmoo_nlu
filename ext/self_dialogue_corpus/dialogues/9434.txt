What do you think of this years XXL freshman list?
I don't know really, a lot of those artists I haven't even heard of.
I agree, PNB Rock and Playboy Carti seem like the only ones who deserved it to be honest.
Definitely, The line up should had Kodak Black or at least NBA Young Boy.
Yeah for sure, if you had a choice who would of been your XXL picks?
Kodak Black, NBA Young Boy, Famous Dex, Playboy Carti and YFN Lucci. How about yours?
I definitely would of picked NBA Young Boy, Blac Youngsta, Nav, Sahbabii and Trippie Redd.
I can agree with that, it just seems like this year they didn't have hardly any diversity.
You're right they definitely just wanted to follow the trend and stay relevant.
Maybe next year we'll get better picks.
