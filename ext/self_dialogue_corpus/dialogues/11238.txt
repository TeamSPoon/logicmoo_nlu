If you could have only one outfit, what would it be?
What do you mean?
I mean if you threw out all your clothes, but could only keep one outfit, what would you keep?
Ahh, right. That's a challenge. I need a moment to think about it.
No problem. For me, though, I think I'd keep my shirt, jeans, and also one coat.
Which coat?
Probably my trench coat. I think I can get away with wearing that in any weather.
Ahhh, right. Outerwear is often more flexible.
For shoes, I think I'd have to pick boots. You can also wear those in any weather.
But is it really a good idea to walk around in boots all the time?
No. But you CAN walk around in boots all the time. That's the point.
Ahh right. For me, I'd probably choose this shirt, jeans, and a coat.
What coat?
Well, probably a peacoat.
But wouldn't you get hot?
Huh? I don't have to wear the this outfit all the time, do I?
Ahhh, you're right. You don't.
For shoes, I feel like normal tennis shoes are pretty flexible.
Really?
Yeah, I wear those during the winter even. They're great.
