Who do you think is going to take home MVP this year?
Well.. it depends..
Depends on what?
On who if Colin Kaepernick gets on a decent team.
Okay, not counting Kaepwenick, who do you think?
I don't know, you go first.
I think Joe Flacco will get it.
Seriously? Joe Flacco?
Yeah man, the Ravens are legit.
I guess.
Well? Who do you pick?
Okay.. I think it will be Jameis Winston.
Jameis Winston?
Yeah.
You pick Jameis Winston and you have the nerve to criticize my choice?
Let's just agree to disagree.
Yeah, I guess you're right.
And besides, Tom Brady is going to win anyway.
Yeah right, you wish.
I don't have to wish. He's great.
