The Godfather was such a good movie
Yeah it was one of my favorite of all time.
I loved every actors part in it.
I think Marlon Brando did better than anyone.
You dont think Al Pacino stole the show?
Not compared with Brando.
I think the story was interesting
The way the first one ended was awesome
Yeah it showed how ruthless he was becoming.
I would have done the same thing!
With the way he did it?
Yeah I think so.
Even Richard Dreyfuss played a great role.
James Caan too.
Yeah I mean I guess we could say it was strong throughout.
The second one was good but I wasnt a huge fan of the flashbacks.
You didnt like DeNiro's role?
I did but I think it should have been a separate film.
I think the flashbacks to old Italy was perfect
I dont like reading subtitles sometimes
