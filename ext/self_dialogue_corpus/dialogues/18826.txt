What album do you think really embodied what Green Day was about?
Nimrod, in my opinon.
You didnt think American Idiot was the best?
That was a rock opera in my opinion.
I like the idea of a concept album.
I just think it was too commercialized.
OK so what about Dookie?
That was such a good album
It brought that genre of rock to the masses.
Not really it was already out there.
Did you like their song Basket Case?
I loved it.
How about the music video?
I thought it was a little weird.
When I come around was another great track.
Yeah they wrote some anthems on that.
I dont think American Idiot had as bad of a sound as you think
They went away from their sound
The title track is still in rotation.
Yeah but people probably skip it nowadays
