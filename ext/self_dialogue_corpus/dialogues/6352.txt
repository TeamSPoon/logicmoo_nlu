So, I saw Maleficent when it came out.
Oh, why?
My wife wanted to see it.
I see, what did you think.
It was horrible, and my wife agreed.
Yes, that's what I heard. Is it the worst Disney movie of all time?
It's a candidate for sure.
What are some other horrible Disney movies?
How about Mars Needs Moms?
Good one. Or how about Frankenweenie? now there's a classic...lol
