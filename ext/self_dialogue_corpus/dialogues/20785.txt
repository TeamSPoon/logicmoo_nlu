Do you remember how special Avatar was?
I saw it in theaters when it first came out so it has been a while.
I watched twice, once very recently.
How did you like it?
It was amazing.
I remember the blue people, what did you like about it.
It shows a unique tribe of indigenous people living off the land.
Ok that sounds interesting.
Then it shows the foreignors coming in.
Ok that is some drama.
Yes it is actually really intelligent and exciting because one foreigner assimilates.
Ok that is a nice plot.
Yes it is really well done, great dialogue and acting.
Is there fighting.
There is some, but its also a romantic movie.
Wow there is a lot going on in this film.
Yes there is basically every type of genre combined into one film.
That usually makes for a great movie.
