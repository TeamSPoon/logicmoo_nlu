I really need to listen to music while I work, but my iPod is broken.
Why don't you stream music on the internet? That's what I do.
What website do you use?
I use a website called Pandora. I would recommend it.
How much does it cost? It sounds expensive.
It's free actually. You can pay for upgraded service without ads etc but I use the free version and it's fine.
It has ads? So it;s like a radio?
There are some ads inbetween songs but it really isn't that bad.
What type of music do they play?
There are various genres in there. You can list your favorite artists and they will play music from that artist and people like them.
I'm not following...Can you give me an example?
For instanse you can create a Michael Jackson channel. On that channel it will play Michael Jackson music, Prince, Jackson 5, Justin Timbalake, and other artists that are similar.
Oh, so it sort of gets to know my preferences.
Yes exactly, and plays music that it think you will like.
That sounds pretty convenient. Is it an app?
It comes in an app for your phone I believe, but I just stream the regular website on my computer while I'm at work.
That sounds exactly like what I need! Thanks so much for letting me know about it.
Sure, no problem. It's the least I can do after you used to make me those mixed tapes casettes when we were in fifth grade
I can't believe you remember that!
Of course I do. I still have a couple of the casettes!
