Do you like Jurassic Park?
What's that?
You've never seen Jurassic Park?
Oh, is that the one with the aliens?
You've got to be kidding me. Jurassic Park has the dinosaurs in it.
Oh yeah! The Steven Spielberg one.
Yeah, only one of the greatest movies of the past 30 years.
Yeah, I've never seen it. I prefer romance movies.
So you really wouldn't watch Jurassic Park?
Too scary. I don't like to watch people get eaten.
But it's a movie!
Doesn't matter. It'll give me nightmares.
Didn't you just watch the movie Saw?
Yeah it was great.
And that didn't give you nightmares?
Nope, I laughed through the whole thing.
That seems a little odd.
Yeah everyone I was watching with thought so too.
You might be insane.
I agree.
