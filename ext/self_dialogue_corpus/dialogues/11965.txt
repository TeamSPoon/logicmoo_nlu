Which is your favorite Star Wars light saber battle?
The battle between Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker at the end of Return of the Jedi.
Yes, the mood and the music really shows Luke Skywalker's anger and struggle.
And when he finally bests Vader and chops his robot hand off, it is so intense.
What do you think about the whole Vader redeems himself at the end thing?
I guess seeing his son getting destroyed by Palpatine stirred something in him.
And then Vader got to become a force ghost at the end.
But then George Lucas changed the original force ghost to Hayden Christensen from the prequels.
Yeah, that was a bit of an odd choice.
As were many of George Lucas' changes to the original films.
