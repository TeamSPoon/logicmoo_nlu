Did you ever see 28 days later?
That's one of my favorite horror movies! It was extremely clever.
It really was. The directing by Danny Boyle was fantastic.
I love his cinematic style. It was such a harsh movie but you can still view it multiple times.
I know I've seen it at least 20 times. I think this is the first zombie movies where they run fast.
You're right, they're always limping and slow moving.
The original Night of the Living Dead set off the zombie genre.
That was an excellent movie. A lot of controversial themes in it too.
Right, it was really groundbreaking. Feels claustrophobic too, so you get a visceral reaction to it.
I know. The scene at the end where the hero dies because of a mistake is so sad though.
