Will the Bengals ever Fire Marvin Lewis?
I hate to say it but no
And what is your reason for that?
Because he is black.
Plenty of black coaches have been fired
Yes youre right but none in Cincinatti
So they are afraid of firing him?
No I think they just dont want to really win
I dont follow your logic
Think about it, he gets them competitive and hes a minority coach
Oh ok I see, so its semantics.
Absolutely and its pretty sad.
Yeah cant he see hes just a puppet?
Would you turn down an NFL job?
If I was just a puppet, yeah.
Wrong, youd keep it especially if there were no expectations
Yeah you are right about the expectations part
Think about it, as long as he shows up he aint getting fired.
So hes the black Bill Belichick
Without any of the successes hes had, yes
