Have you ever had an artist that you're supposed to like but don't?
I'm not sure I know what you mean.
Like an artist that all of your favorite artists like or all your friends with similar taste like or who all the critics are hyping.
Oh, I get what you're saying now. I for sure have had that happen, Sonic Youth is my prime example.
Oh my god! Same!
Right, like I know they're super influential and great, but when I hunker down and listen to a record I don't connect.
That's the litmus test. If I'm not connecting after listening multiple times after years, I know it's not for me.
Still disappointing to know that you're missing something.
I know. I feel this way about a lot of bands though.
Who else?
Have you heard of Guided by Voices?
I think so. They're a nineties band?
Started at the end of the eighties and still making music today. Incredibly prolific indie rock group.
That rings a bell.
Yeah, well, I talk to a lot of music nerds and over the years I've gotten a ton of flack for not liking them.
People saying like "how do you not like them?"
Exactly. The Flaming Lips too, there's something too campy about them for me.
I love the Flaming Lips, but I get your point.
Thank you for not ripping my head off!
Ha! It's your taste, not mine, good for me, not for you!
