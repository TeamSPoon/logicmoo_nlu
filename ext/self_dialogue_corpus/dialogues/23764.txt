Do you like old movies?
I'm not a fan of old movies except for musicals.
What musicals do you like?
I like Camelot, The King and I, My Fair Lady, and The Sound of Music.
Which is your favorite?
I don't think I have a favorite because I like them all for different reason.
What kind of reasons? Can you be more specific?
Well, I like Camelot because I love the story of King Arthur and, although it's a little odd for knights to be singing it really tells the story well.
What about The King and I? Is that the one with Yule Brenner in it?
I like that one because it shows how valuable good teaching is and how a person who is willing to learn and grow can make a difference in the world.
I see. Isn't My Fair Lady just about a poor girl who becomes rich?
Not exactly. It's more about how someone can learn to overcome their circumstances and present their best self to the world.
So you think that all musicals have some kind of moral to their story?
No, not all, but a lot of them do. I guess that's why I like them.
The Sound of Music is one of my favorites. I love how Maria wins over the Captain just by being herself.
Me too! That's exactly the kind of thing that musicals bring to light.
You mean that they are wholesome...good family entertainment?
Not exactly. I mean that they have good acting, expansive sets and costuming, a fantastic story, and some educational value too.
Well I guess that is the teacher in you showing through.
Hmmm...I suppose it is.
