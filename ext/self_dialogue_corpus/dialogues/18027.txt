Hey have you listened to the band No Doubt?
The one with Gwen Stefani? Yeah I've heard some of their stuff.
I've been listening to them a lot lately.  They have some great music.
They definitely have a unique sound.  They've been around since the mid nineties I believe.
Yeah I think it was like 1994 when I first heard of them.
That sounds right.  I think Tragic Kingdom was the first album.
Yeah, and it was kinda ska punk.  It was definitely unique for that time period.
They're from California, right?
Certainly sounds that way to me.  Tragic Kingdom had the Don't Speak single didn't it?
Yeah that was the one that really caught the nation's attention.
Yeah, and then Gwen Stefani sorta took off from there.
Well that's what got her noticed I believe.
But then she had Hella Good and Simple Kind of Life and Underneath it All, remember?
Oh yeah, those were great hits too.
Didn't they get some grammys?
I'm pretty sure they did.  They were pretty famous for awhile there.
I think the Sweet Escape in 2006 was Gwen's solo album wasn't it?
Yeah I think she had several.  That was a great song too.
Yeah, I really like her.  I'm not sure what happened to the rest of the band.
I have no idea.
