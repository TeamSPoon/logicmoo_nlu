Did you know that I haven't seen Lion KIng in years
Really? Me too! We should really watch that one of these nights.
Yeah, maybe watch Aladdin too.
Good choice, man, Disney had a lot of good movies in the 90s
I know! They just couldn't miss for the longest time.
Even the direct to video sequels were pretty good. They could have made a lot of money if they released them in theaters.
Toy Story was the only exception, that series made a lot of money.
I wonder if they're going to make a new Toy Story.
I'd think so, it's still pretty popular.
Yeah, maybe they'll make a new Toy Story once Frozen's run it's course.
