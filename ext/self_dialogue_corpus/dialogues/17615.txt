Let's talk about music.
Okay sounds good.
I like Kelly Clarkson's music.
Oh me too.
What song do you like from her?
I like Miss Independent.
Oh my gosh that song is great!
Do you have all of her albums?
Not yet.
You definitely should by them.
Yeah I will look into them.
I also like Justin Beiber's music.
Oh same he is actually pretty talented.
I have not seen him in concert yet though unfortunately.
It's okay, I have not either.
Have you heard his new music?
Not yet.
It is very good.
Well that is good, anyways it was great talking to you.
Same!
