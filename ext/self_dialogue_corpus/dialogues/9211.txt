Do rock bands always get kind of lame when they have been together for decades?
Not always, haven't you been following Swans?
Not since The Seer. Are they an old band?
Yeah, Swans has been around since the 80s and their style keeps evolving.
Have you heard their most recent albums?
I actually have not heard their most recent one, The Glowing Man, but To Be Kind was good.
They remind me of Tool, if Tool actually released new music on a regular basis.
Well, Tool is a different kind of band. Their songwriting is more methodical.
How methodical?
Compared to Swans, what Tool does is precise, deliberate, and mathematical.
