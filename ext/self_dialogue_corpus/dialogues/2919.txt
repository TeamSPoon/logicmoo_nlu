Don't you think it is strange that some states have several teams.
Yes I do.
And then some states have no teams.
Where are all the multiples?
Well California has a bunch.
They have Oakland, San Francisco, LA and San Diego right?
Yeah.  Four teams in one state.
What about Florida.  How many do they have?
They have Jacksonville and Tampa Bay.
What about the Dolphins?
Oh yes, I forgot Miami.
And then I suppose New York has a couple teams.
Bills, Jets and Giants.
I guess I had never really thought of that.
It must be strange.  How do you choose what your home team is.
I suppose however you are raised usually.
It was easy for me.
Why is that?
I grew up in Wisconsin.
I suppose everyone is a Packer fan there.
