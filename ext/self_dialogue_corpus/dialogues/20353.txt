What did you think of the Minions movie?
Despicable me? Love it.
No, the actual Minions movie.
Ohh, right. I saw that a while ago.
Me too. Was your theater packed with kids?
Yes, it was almost unbearable.
You hate family movies?
Of course!
So what was your favorite part of the movie?
Probably them killing all the bosses accidentally.
The T-Rex was a bit weird, though
Why?
Their weight isn't enough for the T-Rex to even feel, let alone move him.
Ha, that's right.
The villains were super villain-y.
It's not like they stole the moon.
Yeah, but the family the minions joins was super violent and mentally ill
I guess.
I own it, want to come over?
Nah, once is enough.
