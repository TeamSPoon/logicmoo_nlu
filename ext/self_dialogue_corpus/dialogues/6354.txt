Have you seen the new beauty and tge beast movie.
No the original was my absolute fave growing up.
Yeah im not sure I would like anything but a cartoon version.
Right and I heard there was a lot of controversy
Yeah something about somebody being gay ir something
Everyone has a problem with something
Its harder to tell those things in cartoon
I dont know if I like disney doing real life movies of classics.
Yeah they should stick with classics
I will still probably watch it though
