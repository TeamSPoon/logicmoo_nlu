My son is an ice hockey player. What sports do your children play?
My children do not play sports but are interested in ice  hockey, how do they get started?
Our town has an ice hockey team at the local ice rink. Our son started playing in second grade.
He must have known how to skate before he started playing ice hockey.
Nope, he suited up in all of his gear including padded pants, knee pads, a helmet and skates and was off on the ice.
How long before he was playing ice hockey games?
He started playing competitive ice hockey in the third grade.
Wow that is impressive.
He learned to skate and control the puck very quickly. The challenge was doing both at the same time without falling down.
Are there ice hockey camps?
Yes, lots of camps are available in the area that work on both skating skills and puck skills during the summer.
How much of an investment is it for children to play hockey?
In our town about $2000 a year with all of the gear. Of course with a growing boy you need new skates every year. We also travel a lot so there are extra costs.
This is a bit expensive are there other options?
Actually, $2000 is very reasonable. If you travel down the hill you will be paying about $5000 a year if not more and it is very competitive.
Are their options for non-competitive play?
Absolutely, there are house teams that you can join that do not travel.
Can you buy used equipment or borrow equipment?
Yes, we started with borrowed equipment to make sure our son was really willing to commit to playing.
I will have to look into this ice hockey opportunity.
