Did you see that Boston got the number 1 pick in the NBA draft?
Well, at least something went right for them this week!
I know! Cleveland has just destroyed them so far in the series.
On their own home court!
Looks like LaBron is on a mission again.
I wonder if they will even lose a game the way they're going!
Well,  the Golden State Warriors might have something to say about that.
Indeed.  Everyone handed them the championship before the season started.
Yeah. But now I'm not so sure.
Not kidding. When LaBron plays like this, he's just a force of nature.
I know I'm not getting in his way.
Can you imagine taking a charge from him when he's got a head of steam up?
No way. That's gotta hurt.
But poor Boston. They were probably feeling pretty good about themselves.
Yep. They've squandered home court advantage, and it hasn't even been close.
Embarassing!
Those Boston fans get pretty nasty when things don't go well.
Yep. They've had a lot of success there, and they always expect maximum effort.
Not to mention, there's always racists in the crowd there.
It's sad. A great historical city, but a few bad apples can ruin a town's reputation in a hurry.
