Watching movies always helps get my mind off of things, what about you?
Thats what I love to do during a strressful day! Just set back and watch a funny movie.
Comedies are what I love as well. What is your favorite movie?
Not sure about movie, but my favorite actor is Will Farrell.
He is one of mine as well, every film he does always cracks me up
Tell me about it! I could watch his movies all day and not get bored.
I loved Anchor man; so many funny parts in that one!
That is an awesome movie, I love when he is fighting with his co-anchor.
Yea those scenes are comedy gold, and they never get old whatsoever.
I also love all of his interactions with Vince Vaughn in the film.
Yea those are priceless! I wished those two would do more movies together!
I agree with you there, those two really play off of each other very well.
Have you seen anchorman 2 yet?
Yes, I actually bought the DVD the first day it was released.
I dont have the DVD, but I did go see it  with my brother at the theater. We both loved it!
I think I have probably watched it about twenty times by now.
I did not like it as much as I did the first one though. It was funny and all, just not the same to me as the original.
They are very close to me, but I agree the first one was a little better.
Sequels hardly ever live up to the hype of the first movie in my opinion.
That is very true! I truly enjoy both of them though.
