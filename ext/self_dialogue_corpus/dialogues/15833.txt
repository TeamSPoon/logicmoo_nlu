Have you heard the new Octagon?
Doctor Octagon, like Kool Keith?
Yea, the crazy man himself.
I did not even know he still made music.
Oh yea, still at it strong?
Has he changed at all or still just off the walls?
He is exactly as he used to be.
I haven't heard about him since Dr Octagonecologyst.
Yea, that is still his best, 3000 is a classic.
You can't forget about Earth People.
New York and California.  I was born on Jupiter.
Too funny, I always get a laugh out of that one.
Yea, his new album is actually produced by L'orange.
Wow, I would not have guessed they would be working together.
It surprised me as well.
L'orage has been quite prolific recently I feel.
Yea, he also did an album with Jeremiah Jae.
Didn't he also do one with Mr. Lif.
Yea, both of those were pretty recent.
That is cool, his stuff is great.
