Do you consider Talyor Swift to be a pop artist or country.
I think she used to be country, but she's definitly pop now.
Really, I still hear the country in her though.
No way, she moved on from that with Fearless, just listen to that album.
Yeah, I guess the title track is pretty pop.
well, 1989 sealed the deal.  Shake it off it all pop.
Ok, your'e right.  That song is total pop bubble gum.
it sure is, think of all the youtube videos of people dancing and singing to it
Its great.  I love watching the cop drive around singing shake it off
See, only a teeny bop pop song sung by a cop woudl get so many hits.
