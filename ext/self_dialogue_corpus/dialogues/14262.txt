Do you watch NBA games frequently?
Yes, I am a big fan of LA Lakers. How about you?
I like Golden Warriors. What is your opinion about it?
Well, it leads the league but I do not like it.
Why don't you like Warriors?
It is unbeatable, and it has several players which can be top 10 of the league. I do not like to see them playing in the same team.
I understand, but don't think watching Warrior's games is so fun?
Maybe, but I feel sorry for other teams which play again them, They become so weak.
Not really. Do you know that Warriors was defeated by Caveliers last year in the NBA final?
I watched the finals. King James is King!
Are you a fan of King James?
Not really though. If King James can join Lakers, I would become a big fan.
I do not believe that would be true.
Why do you think so?
Well, LeBron James is turnning 32 this year. Lakers has no hope to win the championship in the next few years.
But Lakers is located in LA. I know many players want to be part of LA Lakers.
There are two teams in LA.
Clippers? Well, I am not a fan at all.
I see. Lakers is in your heart.
Exactly, and I am willing to see Lakers to go to the NBA finals again in the next few years.
