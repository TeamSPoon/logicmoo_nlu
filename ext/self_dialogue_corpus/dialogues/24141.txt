Did you ever end up watching The Martian?
Yes, I did finally.
What did you think of it?
It was OK, it felt a lot like Gravity to me.
I thought it was much better than Gravity.
In what ways?
Gravity may have looked better but this seemed more plausible.
Both seemed to be pretty over the top in my opinion.
What in the movie did you think was impossible?
Well, the gravity on Mars is way lower than Earth, but he was walking around normally.
Sure, that is understandable, it is a movie after all.
Also that wind storm in the beginning would be impossible.
The author of the book actually talked about that being one of the few impossible things in the story.
Also how he walked all over the potatoes he was planting.
Yea, none of those potatoes would have grown.
Is it even possible to use human feces as fertilizer?
I am actually not too sure on that point.
I think I remember reading you cannot.
I still had a fun time with the movie and enjoyed it.
I thought it was fine but over hyped.
