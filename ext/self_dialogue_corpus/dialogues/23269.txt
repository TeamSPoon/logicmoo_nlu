Are you excited for The Mummy reboot?
I sort of am, but not sure.
Did you like the original trilogy?
The first was fun, the second as well, but less so. The third was okay but I think I grew out of it.
What about the extensions?
What do you mean?
The Scorpion King has its own trilogy, I think.
I won't go near those; they're awful.
So, what would it take to make you see the new movie?
It would have to have great reviews.
Do you think it will?
I'm not sure. Tom Cruise makes good movies.
Plus he runs all over the place.
They even have a "run while the floor around you is collapsing" trope in the trailer, which I hate.
Do you know who plays the actual mummy?
No idea, who?
Sofia Boutella
Never heard of her -- what's she been in?
She was most recently Jaylah in Star Trek Beyond.
Ooooh, gotcha. Eh, she hasn't won me over yet.
