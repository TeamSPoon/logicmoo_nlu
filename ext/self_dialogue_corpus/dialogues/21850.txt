We need to decide on a movie for movie night.
Right, how long do we have before people get here?
About twenty minutes. We need to hurry!
Okay. Then let's decide now. What are the options?
Well, I've got copies of Jurassic Park, Mean Girls, and Lost in Translation.
That's a really odd set of movies.
Well, the TV doesn't hook up to a computer, and this is all I have DVDs of.
Okay, so which of those are you leaning.
Well, my favorite of the three is Lost in Translation.
Who's in that again? Scarlett Johansson?
Yeah, and Bill Murray. Sophia Coppola directed.
Right, so should we go with that?
I'm just not sure it's a great group movie.
Maybe funny would be better.
Should we try Mean Girls then?
Which one is that?
It's the one Tina Fey was in. With Lindsay Lohan.
Oh, that's a hilarious movie.
Okay, let's go with this then.
It sounds like a great choice!
