Hey have you heard of the new Valerian movie coming out?
Valerian?
Yeah Valerian and the city of a thousand planets. It's a sci fi adventure flick.
This is the first I have heard of it. Does it look good?
Yeah man its looks sick it is being made by some of the same people that did Fifth Element, remember that?
Remember?! Of course I remember Fifth Element.
Haha, yeah I knew you would.
So are they set in the same universe or something? Is it a sequel?
No no, at least I don't think so...
It would be cool if it was.
The Valerian movie is about these two like youngish looking secret agent types that are on a mission its a girl and a boy as protagonists.
What's their mission?
That isn't too clear in the trailers, seems to be some ominous bad guy that wants to destroy the city.
The city?
Yeah Valerian is the city. The visuals in this movie are going to be grand and stunning.
Sounds like the story won't be too good though.
Yeah I am hoping it is though. There' seems to be a good amount of action too.
Whose starring in it?
The girl is Cara Delevingne, not sure about the second protagonist.
Ah cool I like her past stuff.
