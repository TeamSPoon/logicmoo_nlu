What did you think of The Force Awakens?
I really liked it, but it was a little of a let down.
How so?  I loved it.
I was very similar in plot to A new Hope... The first one.
I understand where your coming from, but that didn't detract from my overall enjoyment.
I did make me anxious and excited to see the next one....
Me too; I think Rey is going to get some serious training from Luke.
I hope so.  That new soccer ball robot is so cute as well.
Gotta' love the advent of quality CGI that makes it possible; total eye candy.
For sure... Rey is cute too!
