Remember the amazing pop female singers that were in the late 90s and early 2000s?
How could I forget! There were so many!
Um, yes. Let's start with Mandy Moore!
Oh she was such a hit with her song 'Candy.'
It was very pop! Also, her song 'Crush' was so sweet too.
I agree.  Mandy was definitely cute too, which helped with her success back then.
How about Jessica Simpson?
Oh she was a powerhouse for sure! Her song 'Irresistible' was by far my favorite.
That song was great!
Her voice is very seductive yet sweet.
I guess she couldn't pick between the two! How about Cristina Aguilera?
The ultimate singer for sure.  Her vocals were out of this world!
I would have to say she's the best vocalist of them three.
Right, her song 'Genie in a Bottle' was my favorite.
I think that was just the tip of the ice berg.
Haha you're right. When she came out with 'What a Girl Wants' I was blown away.
I think that was a great song for sure.
What do you think of her being in the 'Lady Marmalade'?
I think she was fantastic in that song!
Me too, I wish I can do all the riffs she does.
