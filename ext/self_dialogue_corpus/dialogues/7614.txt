I had a Harry Potter movie marathon the other day.
Aren't those movies amazing?!
Yes! things you don't even realize were important are revealed to big deals later.
Oh yes, like the whole time you don't even realize that Dumbledore has the elder wand ( A Deathly Hollow)
Exactly, it's like everything connects in the end.
Right, look at how Sirius was so important to Harry and trying to stop Voldemort from rising when the whole time his own brother had actually started his own mission to stop him long ago.
I just wish they would've showed more of Voldemort's background, like the things that happened with his family history .
Yeah, seeing how his mother tricked the muggle Tom Riddle into loving her with a love potion and resulting into Tom Marvel Riddle ( Voldemort ) being born and implied that since he was conceived under a love spell he can't love would've been pretty informative.
But the best part of the movies is Snape-Alan Rickman.
Absolutely, he was exactly how you could imaging Snape. He was perfect, and that scene of him dying in the boathouse makes me cry every single time.
