Have you ever seen the Final Destination series?
No, what's it about?
It a really good horror series. There's five movies and they're all about different disasters that people saw before they happened and were able to save everyone.
Well, that doesn't sound like a horror movie at all!
You would think, until Death comes back for them all. They start dying in the order they would have if they hadn't been saved, in really gruesome ways.
Wow! And there's five whole movies about this?
Well, they all kind of connect. In the first one, one girl survives, but then she tries to help the people in the second one and ends up dying then.
Cool! Any thing else I might like?
There's also a twist ending with the last one, but I don't want to spoil it for you!
I'll let you know if I watch them!
