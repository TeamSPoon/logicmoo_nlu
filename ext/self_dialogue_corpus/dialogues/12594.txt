In Star Wars, I think Princess Leia didn't like wookies at all.
Why do you think that? Everyone likes wookies because they're awesome.
At the end of A New Hope, she gave a medal to Han and Luke but Chewbaca didn't get a medal. Chewbaca had a big part in destroying the Death Star but no medal.
That's true. I always wondered why Chewie didn't get a medal. He was even standing next to Han Solo and Luke Skywalker at the ceremony.
Also in The Force Awakens when Rey and Chewbaca come back after Han Solo's death, Leia gives Rey a hug but not Chewbaca.
That's interesting. Rey just met Han and didn't know him well but Chewbaca and been Han's best friend and partner for many years.
Exactly. Chewie was probably very upset over Han's death and Leia should know that but she just ignored Chewbaca and consoled Rey.
It's possible that wookies have a different culture and express grief different than humans. Maybe hugging him would not be the correct thing to do.
That still doesn't explain why he didn't get a medal in A New Hope.
Poor Chewie. I hope that him and Rey can become great friends and adventure partners.
