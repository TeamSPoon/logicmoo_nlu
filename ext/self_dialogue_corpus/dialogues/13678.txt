I like Yoda from the movie EMPIRE STRIKES BACK.
Yoda was funny with that Grover voice.
And the way he talked.
Yes. He would say things a lot different.
He reminds me of like an old wise man.
I think Yoda was like 700 years old or something.
He looked old but used his light saber in that other movie.
He was really short.
Yeah, and he had the wobble when he walked.
I miss Yoda.
