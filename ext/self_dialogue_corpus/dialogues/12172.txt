Who played Obi-Wan Kenobi?
That was Alec Guiness.
British actors are so much better than American ones.
I agree. Alec really gave the first movie a grounded presence.
He is a good actor.
Did he send Luke to find Yoda?
Yes, I believe he did in the second movie.
Which one was that?
That was in The Empire Strikes Back.
That one was even better than the first movie.
