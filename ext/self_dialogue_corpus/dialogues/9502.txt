I don't really understand whether there's a difference between rap and hip-hop. The language confuses me.
That's cool, a lot of people use them pretty interchangeably. But I was watching this awesome old film Wild Style that really showed how rap is an element of hip hop culture overall.
What do you mean "an element"?
Well, hip hop is like the overall multi-media art form. It typically has four elements, it's just that we don't talk about some of them as much.
So what are these four elements?
Rap (the words), Dj-ing (scratching, turntables), dance, and graffiti
Oh, so rap is more the...verbal element?
Yeah! I just think it's really interesting how we never really talk that much about graffiti or the visual style anymore.
Yeah, I have no idea about any of that. I've seen some hip-hop influenced dance, though.
Yeah, but even that makes it sound like it came later, as opposed to being an integral part all along.
