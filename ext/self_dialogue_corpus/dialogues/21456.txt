Have you watched the new movie, "The Mummy"?
No, is that the one with Tom Cruise in it?
Yes, he is the main character.
It's been awhile since Tom Cruise has been in a new movie.
I know, but I thought it was pretty good, but not his best.
What's the movie about?
Well, Tom Cruise and Jake Johnson are soldiers, but they are a bit corrupted. They like to steal antique artifacts.
Oh, okay. I remember seeing it advertised on television now. It seemed to have pretty good graphics and special effects.
I will say that the special effects were pretty good. It had some pretty funny spots in it too.
Really? I didn't really think it would be a comedy.
Oh, it's not a comedy, it's an action movie. But, they did incorporate a bit of humor. I thought it was a good touch.
Yes, I like action movies with humor too. So, did you enjoy the movie, was it a new plot, or a bit expected?
Well, I felt it was a bit expected, definitely reminded me of "The Mummy" starring Brendan Fraser.
Oh, yes, that's right! I remember that movie.
Yes, very similar plot line, except the mummy was a woman in this one.
Oh, yes, I remember seeing her in the advertisements on television. Did she do a good job with the role?
Yes, she actually was very good at the role. Of course, there was a romance for Tom Cruise, which is a bit typical.
True, I believe there was a romance that developed for Brendan Fraser in "The Mummy" too.
Yes, you're right. But, it's an okay movie, worth a watch.
Okay, well I will make sure I check it out. Thanks!
