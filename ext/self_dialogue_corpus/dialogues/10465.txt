Hey, friend!
Hey, good to see you! How has your week been?
It's been OK. I've been kind of sick.
Ah, sorry to hear that.
It's OK. I called in to work and just played video games and watched movies all day.
Oh yeah? What movies?
Well, I'm feeling a little too crappy to really focus on anything, so I watched some of my old favorites.
Like what?
I turned on Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark. I hadn't watched that one in years.
That's definitely one of my all-time favs as well.
It's amazing how well it holds up. What's it been, 30 years now?
At least that, I'd bet.
I also watched Mad Max: Fury Road. Have you seen that one?
Oh yeah. It's so good.
Maybe my favorite movie that came out last year.
Seems like weird sick day viewing though, don't you think?
I don't know; I kind of just turned it on and let it wash over me.
OK, I can see that. It's a crazy movie but very visually pleasing.
Definitely. Some of my favorite action sequences ever.
That first vehicle chase sequence belongs in a museum.
