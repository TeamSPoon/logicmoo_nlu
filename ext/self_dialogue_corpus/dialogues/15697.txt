So have you been listening to any good music lately?
Yeah, though recently I've been on a bit of a 2010s kick.
Feeling nostalgic?
Hey, in my defense, those years have some great pieces!
Such as?
I was listening to Titanium by Guetta and Sia yesterday, that one's pretty great.
Wow, was that really seven years ago?
Technically it came out in 2011, but yeah, it's pretty old now.
I never would have guessed that. I loved that song!
It's interesting to see how much Sia's voice has changed since then as well.
True, true. Did Guetta do "Without You" as well?
Yep! That's actually the song that got me started on the 2010s kick.
I loved that song, though I didn't actually hear it from Guetta at first.
What do you mean?
Well, I originally heard it as a cover by Cimorelli.
The YouTube band with all the sisters?
Yep, that's the one.
Huh, interesting. I prefer the original myself.
Guetta's music is great. When was the last time he released a song?
I think he's mostly a dj/producer, so last I heard he was doing some music with Justin Bieber.
