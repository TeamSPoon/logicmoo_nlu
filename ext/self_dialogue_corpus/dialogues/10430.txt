Hey, what's up?
Nothing much. How have you been?
I've been doing pretty well. You?
I'm doing really great right now. I just saw the greatest superhero movie ever.
Oh yeah? It was better than Man of Steel?
Yeah it actually was.
Stop holding me in suspense. What's the movie?
Logan.
From the X-Men series?
Yep. It's set in the future and he's old.
Wow.  What made it so good?
He has a kid and it's bloody.
Sounds like my kind of movie.  Did it just come out?
Yeah, a few weeks ago. It's actually kind of sad.
Well, I'll see for myself. Don't spoil the movie for me.
I won't tell you anymore.
Good.  Do you mind seeing the movie twice?
No. I would definitely watch that movie again.
Great. Let's go this weekend.
It's a date.
