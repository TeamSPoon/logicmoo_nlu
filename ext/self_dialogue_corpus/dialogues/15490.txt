Let's talk about music.
What about music?
What's your favorite song?
Merry Go Round by MGK.
Hmm. I've never heard it.
Omg, you have to listen to it! It's so good!
What's so great about it?
It's about shooting up heroine. It's so sad.
I'm a recovering heroin addict. I'm not sure I should listen to it.
Yeah, you're right. It's pretty graphic. It may trigger you.
He has other good songs, too. Like Dopeman.
Seriously.
Yeah! It goes, "I just pulled up on the dopeman! He just pulled up in the ol' van! Piece in my-"
Right, like that song's any better!
Oh, good point.
Shaking my head.
Well it's still a good song.
Do you know any songs that aren't about getting high?
Well...uhh...you see...I know a song about getting sober...
You would.
