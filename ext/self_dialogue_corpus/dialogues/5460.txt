Can you believe Disney, one of my favorite genres (yes.. its a genre ;) ) owns Marvel AND Star Wars now?!
Its nuts. All my favorite superhero's, space battles and princess's in one place. It's great!
Disney seems like it can do no wrong lately.
Most have all been gems.
I know. And! a new Star Wars every year.. just awesome..
Some Star Wars fan was granted their three wishes for sure.
It was me, "I rubbed the lamp!"
Hehe. I'd believe it. Your such a fan boy.
Totaly, but my third wish wasn't for that. Can you guess?
