Have you seen Green Room?
Yes, it is so good!
I know right? I loved the actress from arrested development.
Alia Shawkat is her name. she was maybe on arrested development. Sam in green room.
That's right. She looks different now. But still realized where I had seen her prior.Thought she was great in this film.
She was good, but for me the stand out girl was Imogen Poots.
She was barely recognizable in the role of amber.
That was a great role very badass. and she was great in it!
Agreed she was also very believable. Overall such a thrill ride of a film!
So many good performances and the plot and pacing was perfect.
