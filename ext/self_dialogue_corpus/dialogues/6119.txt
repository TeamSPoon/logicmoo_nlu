I hope you saw Disney's Inside Out.
Yep I did. Good right?
Yeah, so clever. How did they come up with the premise.
Guess they wanted to explain emotions to kids.
But the representation was so interesting.
Very clever and unique. I'm glad they did it.
Its a good movie for kids.
Positive, too. So kids can understand.
That they are in control and that feelings are good.
Yeah it had an uplifting message.
