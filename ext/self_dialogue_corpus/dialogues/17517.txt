Do you know that Marron 5 just realeased a new song?
No I didn't know. Does that mean that there is a new album on the way?
I don't know. The song actually came out like 4 months ago.
Oh, ok. Well, it's been a while since their last album.
It has been a while since. I don't really know how music is working these days now.
Yeah. Everything comes and goes so fast that you can't even catch up with anything.
Well, they released this song called "Cold" a few months ago, and it is great. It made me want to get back together and jam with it.
Well I have to hear it. But we can jam anyhow.
I hope my voice can still go as high as Adam Levine`s.
I'm sure man. It hasn't been that long ago since you sung some high pitch songs.
Well, I'll practice a bit before and then we can set a date.
Perfect. And you should practice some old Maroon 5 songs also since we are on that mood.
I will. I really hope they come out with a great new album soon.
Yes. They are a very trustworthy band.
I know, right? Their studio work is always impeccable.
It is. I think it has to do a lot with their producers.
I hope they work again with the producer from "Overexposed".
There were many producers working in that album, but the main one was Max Martin.
Well he is the guy they should go for again to set up a great album again.
Yes. They made a great team and they should try it again.
