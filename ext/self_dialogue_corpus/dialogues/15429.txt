What kind of music do you think is good to listen to when you need a pick me up or you're sad?
Depends on my mood, sometimes if I'm angry I like to listen to Linkin Park.
That's a good idea!!
Yes it helps get my frustration out. I love their song "Crawling".
Me too, remember when it first came out?
I do! I remember I thought the music video was strange.
It is a little bit. With the blood flowing down the drain.
I really enjoy their music though.
Did you know that the lead singer is named Chester?
I think I did know that. I always wanted to go see them in concert but never did.
I did as a teenager and it was great!
I bet it was!
You could feel the music as it vibrated, it was that loud.
Sounds like a great time!
It really was. I would go again one day.
I think one of my faves from them to this day is "Somewhere I Belong."
I really like that one too.
Something about the lyrics and the rhythm of that song just get me.
It's a great one.
I play their music in the car a lot.
