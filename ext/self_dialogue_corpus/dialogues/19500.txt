you like metallica?
i like their old stuff
okay, you hipster
master of puppets though
that's my favorite too
the riff on master is so amazing
one of the best riffs ever
it really is
what about sanitarium
that song is so dark and cool
that instrumentals are so tight sounding
even lars was pretty good
everyone hates lars drumming
nah, he's fine
a bit underrated
he's not that good but he does his job
metallica doesnt need a superstar drummer
and lars does all the talking too
he's kinda the spokesperson in a way
yeah
