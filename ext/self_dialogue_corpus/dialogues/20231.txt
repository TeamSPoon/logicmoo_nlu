Do you like any of the movies that were made from Stephen Kings books?
Oh yes, I really liked The Shining.
That was a great movie, the outside of the hotel was shot in my homestate of Oregon!
I have heard that, have you been to it?
No I have not. Have you seen The Green Mile?
That is one of Stephen Kings books, right?
Yes, it was about the prisoner who escaped.
That movie was so good, I have not read the book though.
Me either, but I can imagine the movie followed the book closely.
I would agree, it was a excellent movie.
I can't  believe he spent all that time chipping away at the walls, and ended up getting away.
He was smart to gain the trust of the worden though by doing his books and taxes.
That was a smart move on his part.
Did you see IT, or any of his other movies?
Oh yes, I have seen almost all of them. They are all great movies.
They need to do a remake of The Green Mile and The Shining.
I am unsure that anyone could play the part better than Jack Nicholson though.
That is probably true, he played the crazy insane guy very well.
Still, I wonder who would do good in that part.
There are so many actors I can think of that could play that part.
