Are you a Bon Iver fan?
Yeah I guess.
What's that mean?
I guess I was a fan, but kinda forgot about him actually!
Have you heard the newest album?
Maybe? When did it come out?
I think it's actually been about a year now, though I didn't discover it until a few months ago.
What? Really? I had no idea he put out anything new in years!
Yeah, you should take a listen. It's pretty unique!
Unique in a good way or bad way?
Both I guess!
Ok, you have to explain!
Well some of the songs are beautiful and super poetic and others...
Not good?
Other songs just kinda sound like noise.
Oh weird!
Yeah, I think he strayed a little to far from his roots on this one.
Is it like electronic music?
I would say some of the songs are, yeah.
Huh. Definitely sounds different I'll say that!
