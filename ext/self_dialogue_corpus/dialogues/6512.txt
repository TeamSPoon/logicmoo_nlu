Isn't it crazy how much Disney has grown in the past 10 years or so?
Yeah, it really is! They acquired Pixar and started making awesome movies like Inside Out, Finding Nemo, and Toy Story!
Yes and more recently they acquired Marvel! So how all the Marvel movies are Disney too.
All of The Avengers movies??
Yes all of the Avengers movies and all the ones that will come out in the future!
I think one of the smartest things Disney ever did was acquire the Star Wars franchise.
Definitely! I, personally, will see every Star Wars movie that's released. I actually feel more confident with Disney at the helm.
I was a big fan of The Force Awakens!
I can't wait to see The Last Jedi!
Yes! We need more Luke Skywalker! Did you see the latest trailer?
