Enough of what the critics or the community wants us to think, who is your favorite rapper or rap group of all-time?
Tough question. It'd have to be Outkast for me.
I miss Outkast, I really wish they'd put out another album.
I know, it has been so long since I've heard Andre 3000 and Big Boi together. I miss them.
I miss them too, luckily their music has resonated with so many people and that means we hear their sound all over contemporary stuff.
Right, I was listening to To Pimp a Butterfly and Yeezus last night and thinking about how these albums would be starkly different had Outkast not existed.
Wow, now I'm thinking about a Kendrick Lamar and Outkast collaboration. That'd be so cool.
No man, that'd be cooler than cool, it'd be ice cold! Sorry, that was super corny of me to quote "Hey Ya!"
Corny, but I'll take it. Is that your favorite Outkast song of all time?
No, but it's up there. B.O.B. will probably always be my favorite, I had the good fortune to get to listen to the isolated vocals for that track and I don't know how that amount of rapping in one breath is possible
