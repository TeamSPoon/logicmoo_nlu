How awesome was it when the cars were dropped out of the plane in Furious7?
That was incredible, Rome was the best part though.
Yeah when he was freaking out at the edge of the bay door telling them how he couldn't do it.
Then Tej hits the button for his chute.
It was great hearing him scream the whole way down.
Then he ended up in that tree, I couldn't help but laugh.
How cool would that be to do though?
It would be so much fun, but I'd want to go out face first.
Why would you want to do that?
Cause then I could floor it off the plane and it would force me into a barrel roll. I just think it'd be even more fun.
