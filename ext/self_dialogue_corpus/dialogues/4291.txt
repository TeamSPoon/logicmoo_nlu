So, did you watch any thrillers aside from Taking Lives?  That one's old.
Now that I remember, I recently say The Circle.
I didn't see that one, how did you like it?
I loved it actually!  It was definitely classified as a thriller, but I was laughing and so were some of the other people.
Hmm, now that's interesting.  Tell me more!
Basically only one truly tragic thing happened in the whole movie, which was the death of the girl's ex-boyfriend.
So it wasn't really a scary thriller.
Not really.  Tom Hanks was able to project that "tech entrepreneur" thing very well.
Yes, I could see that a bit from the trailer.  Did he remind you of anyone in particular?
I guess Steve Jobs.  He was always talking about taking things to the next level and acting like a visionary.
