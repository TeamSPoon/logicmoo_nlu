Do you like pop music stars.
What exactly do you mean.
Stars like Justin Bieber.
No,I'm not a fan.
You watch him live and he lip syncs his songs.
I know,I don't care for that.
I go to a live concert,I want live music,not taped.
All the pop stars seem to do that.
Well,they have to dance and run around the stage.
It's got to be a spectacle.
I want to hear music,not taped music and dancing.
I must have heard his song baby a million times.
Thought you didn't listen to him.
No but my granddaughter does.
Oh,I get it.
Give me rock and roll any day.
You got that right.
Give me the stones,the Beatles and CCR every day.
Now that's music.
And a great live show too.
