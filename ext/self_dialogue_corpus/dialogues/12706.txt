How do you see Finn fitting into the next few movies?
I'm not quite sure.  He's not the focal point for sure.
Agreed, that would definitely seem to be Rey.
I see him as being more of the Han Solo variety focused on phasers and one-liners.
I don't think they are trying to make him anything like Solo personality-wise, but get what you mean.
Maybe we'll learn a bit more of where he came from.  Did he grow up on the Death Star?
That's my guess. They probably just take kids and put them into training for the dark side.
I'm wondering if he'll ever be involved romantically with Rey.
I hope not.  No reason to muddy the plot with anything like that.
I agree with you, I just hope the writers do too.
