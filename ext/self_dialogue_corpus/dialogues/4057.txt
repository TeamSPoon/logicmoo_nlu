The Departed was on TV last night.
Man! That is such a good show!
One of my favorites.
Didn't that win an award?
The Oscar for best picture.
I thought so. Scorsese is a genious.
I can't believe a few the actors didn't get awarded.
The Oscars hate DeCaprio.
Haha. This is true.
Sorry I missed that....
