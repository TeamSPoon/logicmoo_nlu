The departed, have you seen it?
No, is it good?
It's one of the greatest crime/suspense movies out there.
I've been meaning to watch, whats so good about it?
Top quality acting with Matt Damn and Leonardo DiCaprio
What else?
There was a mix of drama, suspense and comedy it all just worked so well.
I'll check it out tonight, I love Matt Damon
You wont regret it, get ready for a lot of boston accents.
I used to live in boston, so I'm excited now.
