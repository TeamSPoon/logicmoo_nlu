How do you think the season is going so far?
Good, everyone is playing about where I thought they would.
Are you surprised about the Cubs being so bad?
I dont think they are bad, just going through the pains.
Its hard to repeat.
It is, but I can see them heating up when you need them to.
They are still a well coached team.
And they have decent pitching.
Did you think the Mets would be this bad?
No not at all
Cespedes looks like hes getting old.
And David Wright is no longer a player.
Yeah, couple that with Familia being bad.
Well he isnt bad hes hurt.
That too.
They just dont have timley hitting.
Or getting decent pitching.
Thats the most shocking I think.
Syndergaard really hurt him
Thats the teams fault though
