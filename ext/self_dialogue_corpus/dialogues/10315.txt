Have you seen the commercial for the transformers movie?
Is that the 4th one?
No, it's the 5th one!
I don't even think I have seen the 3rd one.
We should watch it on fire stick this weekend.
Okay. Does it have Shia LaBeouf in it?
The third one does but the new one has Mark Wahlberg in it.
I love Mark! Maybe even more than LaBeouf.
Me too, I thought Ted was hilarious.
Eh, it wasn't my favorite I liked The Perfect Storm.
