Its supposed to rain tomorrow afternoon.  Do you wanna go to the movies with the kids instead of the beach?
Sure, what looks appropriate for them?
We could go see gaurdians of the galaxy?
That sounds good.  We saw the first one last year right?
Well, it came out in 2014, but we did see it.
Oh, and the kids liked it?
Yup, they really liked Baby Groot and Rocket Raccoon.
Isn't Vin Diesel in it.
Kinda, he's the voice of Baby Groot.
Really, who's the big tough guy in it then?
Are you talking about Drax?
Who's that?
Drax the destroyer.  He's the big raging guy with all the red tattoo lines and the blades.
Oh yeah, thats him.  Who plays him?
Dave Bautista.
Yeah, I liked him and the character played by the guy who's in Parks and Rec.
Peter Quill, yeah he's played by Chris Pratt.  He does a great job in the role.
Yeah, the whole cast is so good.
So should I get tickets for us all.
Yes, lets get the tickets and go even if it doesn't rain.
