Dude, did you hear that Guns N Roses are back together?
Oh yeah? Are they writing new material?
No, right now they're just touring. But its a start! Maybe they'll write new music soon.
I've never liked Axl Rose, but they had some pretty good songs. I like Slash though.
Yeah, his solo stuff is good. Have you heard any of his albums?
Yeah, I like his work with Myles Kennedy.
Yeah, Myles is such a good singer. I really like his work with Alter Bridge. His singing style really works well with Tremonti's guitar playing.
Definitely much better than Scott Stapp, that's for sure.
Yeah, I agree. Myles has actual range and emotion.
I think he elevates every musician he plays with.
