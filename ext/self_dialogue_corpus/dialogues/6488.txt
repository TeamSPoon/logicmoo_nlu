Do you think they will make another Toy Story movie?
I don't know, we should look it up.
There were three made so far right?
Yes.
It's amazing how far the animation has come since the first one.
Yes it is a really big difference.
Ah, I see here that a new one is being made.
Oh, that is awesome. When is it coming out?
In 2019.
Great, but that's so far away!
