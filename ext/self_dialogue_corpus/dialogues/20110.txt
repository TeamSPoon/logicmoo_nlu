Have you seen the latest Marvel movie?
Guardians of the Galaxy vol 2? You know it!
Oh! That's already in theaters?
Yeah, it came out on the 5th. I saw it opening night.
I'll definitely check it out this weekend then. I actually meant Dr. Strange though.
Normally I'll see a Marvel movie right away, but I hate to say I just got around to seeing it last weekend.
Don't feel too bad. I've only seen it recently myself.
What'd you think of it?
I thoroughly enjoyed it, but honestly it wasn't my favorite. FAR from the worst though.
Agreed. I probably would have liked it better had I not seen Civil War fairly recently also.
Ah yeah. That one is going to be hard to beat for certain.
Maybe, but Spider-Man homecoming is coming up and Infinity War sounds extremely promising.
I LOVE Spider-Man, but I'm not too nearly as excited for Homecoming as I am Gaurdians of the Galaxy vol 2 to be honest. Would have much preferred an older Spidey, and Garfield was the perfect actor in my opinion.
I have mixed feelings. Homecoming feels true to the Ultimate comics universe, but Andrew Garfield really was the perfect adult Spider-Man so far anyways.
New kid didn't do too bad in Civil War though so there's definitely potential. He captured Peter's smart mouth nicely.
Yeah, and I'm really excited to see more of his interaction with Tony Stark.
Speaking of, that was a perfect casting for Iron Man.
Yeah, it's going to be hard to replace Robert Downey Jr. Think Infinity War is his last movie as Tony Stark.
That's a shame. Wonder who they'll cast to replace him in Iron Man 4?
Same, but as long as it isn't Ben Affleck I think we'll be good. Marvel seems to know what they're doing so I trust their judgement completely.
