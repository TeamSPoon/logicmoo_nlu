Do you know who AC/DC is?
Of course though i'm not a huge fan but I do like their music.
One of my favorites is Highway to Hell.
That's a classic.
Yeah and I think it lasts the ages so even younger generations can appreciate it.
I agree I heard my son listening to it the other day it made me smile.
What's one of your favorites?
Thunderstruck.
That's another good one.
I used to listen to it before football games in highschool.
Why would you do that?
It got me pumped to play and in the zone.
That's a good reason.
It really did the job of motivating me to succeed though i'm not sure why.
Well it's the feel of the song I think it does that for most people.
It made me excited when I listened to it.
That's the good thing about old music it did that.
I agree and that's something missing from today's music.
I couldn't agree more.
I miss those days.
