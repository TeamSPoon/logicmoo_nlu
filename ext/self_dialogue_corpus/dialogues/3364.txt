If you have not seen Cabin in the Woods yet, stop and go watch it.
I saw it! Joss Whedon did great.
Did you notice Thor was in it?
Chris Hemsworth? Yeah, he was all right. I liked Marty's character best.
He made me think of a smarter Shaggy from Scooby-doo.
He was good at pointing out the obvious things, like maybe not going into the scary basement. He felt like an audience member sometimes.
Sigourney Weaver's cameo was nice, too.
I loved the elevator lobby scene. It is probably my favorite, even better than the one in The Shining.
Did you expect the ending?
Not at all! I cannot believe they ended it like that!
