Which Star Wars movie do you think had the best protagonist?
Isn't Anakin really the protagonist of all of them?
Well, I think he's only really the protagonist for episodes two and three.
So who's the protagonist for episode 1 then?
Qui-gon? Or else Obi-wan.
Okay. And then Luke for four, five, and six?
I think so. You can make an argument for Han in Empire though.
Han would be my favorite then.
I think Luke is the most interesting.
I guess we'll have to agree to disagree.
