What do you think about Frank Ocean?
I really like his stuff, he's super original.
I feel the same way.
Yeah, I haven't heard anything like him ever.
What is your favorite song by him?
Probably, "Nature Feels."
Oh I've heard that one.
What about you?
I don't think I can pick a favorite.
I know what you mean, sometimes its hard to settle on only one song.
Did you know he started out as a ghost writer?
No! I had no idea.
Yeah, he did that until he joined Odd Future in 2010.
Odd Future?
They're another hip hop group. You should check them out.
I definitely will!
Have you seen Frank preform live?
No not yet.
We should get tickets if he ever comes around.
Absolutely, I'd love that.
