Who do you think was the nicest of the Beatles?
From my guess George Harrison.
Why George?
Went to India learned about meditation. Really preached peace.
Speaking of peace, why not John Lennon?
John was a hypocrite when it came to peace.
How so?
John admitted to beating both wives,also he abandoned his son.
Wow! Your narrative is so much different than the mainstream media`s.
I do my homework, and it is documented that John Lennon was the meanest Beatle.
