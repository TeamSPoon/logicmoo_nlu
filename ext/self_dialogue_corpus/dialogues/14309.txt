I don't know what direction the Dallas Mavericks organization is going?
I don't either. I mean Nowitzki is still there maybe they're waiting for his era to be over.
Yeah, but I don't think you can afford to do that
You're right! Especially in the Western Conference.
You cannot afford to be mediocre. Either you suck or you add pieces to get better through free agency
When you look at their roster. Where's their future?
Exactly. I mean Harrison Barnes is a good player, but not great
And Wesley Matthews is a good defender, but a horrible shooter
This roster has holes every where
Yeah I mean they did pick up Nerlens Noel, but has he already maximized his talent?
I thought he would be a little bit better than he is but maybe he needs more time.
You could be right, but when I see him play I just don't see it.
Keep in mind he did deal with some injuries. I think he deserves a little more time
Perhaps, but they need way more than what he can offer
Yeah he is a decent piece but they need star power
Who wants to come to this team the way that it is presently constructed.
That in lies the problem doesn't it.
It really does. I men they have some okay complimentary pieces but it's just not enough.
They need more scores and three point shooters on this team
My thoughts exactly. They got a lot of work to do, but I do love their owner, Mark Cuban.
