You know what movie I really enjoyed? Chef!
The Jon Favreau, Scarlett Johansson movie where he's a top chef and leaves it behind to start a food truck with his son?
That's the movie. I really enjoyed all the shots of food and the meals. It was funny and heart warming too.
I was so hungry when watching that. Remember when he made the grill cheese sandwich? My mouth was drooling.
The way they shot all the cooking scenes with the closeups on what was being cooked definitely made my stomach growl in hunger.
Do you remember the Robert Downy Jr. cameo in there?
Oh yeah that's right Robert Downey Jr. was in there. He was the business guy right?
Yeah it was a brief scene but it was so Robert Downey Jr.
I'm not surprised he was in there. Jon and Robert are really good friends.
Isn't Jon, Robert's chauffeur driver in the Iron Man series?
Yes! He is, he's in every Iron Man movie suited as the chauffeur.
That's funny. Chef was a really surprisingly good movie. I didn't expect much from it. Sofia Vergara played Jon's wife in the movie right?
Sofia was his ex-wife I think but yeah she was in the movie. I think they were either separated or divorced and he would have his son half of the time.
The scenes with the food truck set up and John Leguizamo as the trusted friend helping out were really entertaining.
Cuban sandwiches! That made me want to try one!
Yes! Those sandwiches looked so good.
The son taking pictures of their journey was really cool too.
I felt that was the heart warming part. He kept the project a secret until the end. It was a really good father son relationship movie.
I liked the movie so much. I wish Scarlett was in there more. She basically was just at the restaurant.
I loved those restaurant scenes. I also loved it when Jon blew up at the food critic. Great, fun movie.
