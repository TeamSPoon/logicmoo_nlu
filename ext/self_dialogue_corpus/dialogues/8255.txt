What do you think about Sia?
I don't really listen to her much, but I don't have anything bad to say about her.
So, you like her music?
It's not bad.  At least it isn't annoying like a lot of other music.
No, but she's kind of weird.
I don't know.  The hair thing?
Yeah, that and the weird videos and stuff.
Well, I figure the hair is for her to stay anonymous.
Oh, that would be smart.
Yeah, she could probably easily go out in public.
