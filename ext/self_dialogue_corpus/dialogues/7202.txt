Hey, what are you listening to, on your headphones?
I am listening to the song: "Under the sea"
Oh, Isn't that song from the Disney movie: Little mermaid?
Yes, it is!
Wow, that is an old movie, that came out in 1989!
Ya, it was a long time ago, but I really miss some of the songs in it.
Oh, I sang my fair play of "Little mermaid" songs in school plays.
My favourite character in the movie is Sebastian.
Mine was Prince Eric
Didn't know you are a Disney fan too. Let's go watch it again, I have in on dvd.
