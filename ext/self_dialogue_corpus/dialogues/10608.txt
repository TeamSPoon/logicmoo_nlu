Have you seen any of the Fast and Furious Movies?
Yea, it is my favorite series of movies.
I really like Vin Diesel in the movies. Who is your favorite character?
Paul Walker.
Yea. I really like him too.
It is such a shame he passed away during filming.
I was so sad to hear that he passed.
Me too. I know people that cried.
I though it was really cool that they let his brother film after he passed.
I didn't know the did that. That is really awesome.
