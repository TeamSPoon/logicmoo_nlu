Have you ever seen The Running Man?
Yes, that is with Arnold Shwarzenegger right?
Yes, he is in that one.
He is in tons of action movies.
Ever seen Total Recall?
Of course. He is good in that one too.
I liked him in Conan the Barbarian a lot.
Oh yeah and Conan the Destroyer.
Did you like him in Terminator 3?
Yes, but I liked him way better in part 1 and 2.
