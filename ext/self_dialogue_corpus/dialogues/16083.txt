I was thinking the other day of music that was popular back when I was in middle school.
We were in middle school around the same time. I remember being a huge fan of the Spice Girls.
Oh my goodness yes! They were amazing!
"If you wanna be my lover, you gotta get with my friends..."
"Make it last forever, friendship never ends!"
Yes we would sing that song "Wannabe" over and over.
We made up dance moves.
Remember how we would pick which of our friends was which Spice Girl?
Oh right! That was so much fun.
It really was. I remember I was always Posh Spice.
I was Baby Spice.
I think we even came up with special outfits.
Of course we did. We would go shopping for special outfits.
I also remember they had a movie didn't they?
Yes they did what was the name of it?
I think it was "Spiceworld".
I remember watching that movie with friends at a sleepover.
Yes I think I was there too!
We had some good times.
I think my ultimate fave from the movie was "Spice up Your Life."
