There are so many good pop songs coming out this upcoming summer, what's your favorite?
My favorite is definitely, "Despacito" by Justin Beiber.
I absolutely LOVE that song! He is for sure the Pop King of our time!
He definitely is! I'd have to say my second favorite is, "Everyday" by Ariana Grande.
Her voice is amazing. She is able to hit such high notes, and the added hip hop is such a good touch with Future.
Yeah, pop always sounds nice when it has some rap verses in it.
I agree! Have you gone to any pop concerts lately?
Fifth Harmony is coming to California soon, I may check them out.
Good thinking! My favorite in that pop group is Normani for sure.
She definitely has an amazing voice. I love their song, "Work From Home".
