What do you think about Aaron Rodgers?
I love Aaron Rodgers. He's one of the best quarterbacks in the league.
Do you think he's better than Drew Brees?
Yes, a lot better. Aaron Rodgers can do just about anything. I wish we had him.
He's only been to one Super Bowl.
He doesn't get there or NOT get there on his own. They've had so many injuries these past couple of years.
Everyone has injuries.
Last year they had so many people out, they were using their 3rd and 4th string players in some positions.
I didn't know that.
Well, he's infinitely better than Brett Favre ever was.
I wasn't a Favre fan. I'm not a Green Bay fan either.
There are teams I like and others I don't for various reasons. I like Green Bay.
I like the Saints.
I used to like the Saints until that whole deal with the bounties. Turned me off knowing Brees and the coaches went along with it.
They said they didn't know.
They knew. Even the players who admitted it said Brees and everyone else knew. Heck, the coach instituted the bounty and on film.
I forgot about that.
Yeah, it was sickening. They had a bounty on Peyton Manning but didn't get him hurt. They got to everyone else.
That sounds illegal.
I think it should be punishable by law. At least Coach Williams got fired and suspended and Head Coach Payton got a one-year suspension.
