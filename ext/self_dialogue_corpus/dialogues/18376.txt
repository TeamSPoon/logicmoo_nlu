Do you remember Aaliyah the singer?
Yes! She was at my graduation night at Disney World back 1997.
She had an amazing voice. She was from Brooklyn New York.
Yeah. She was on that television show star search when she was ten years old.
I know! I saw that video on YouTube.
She did recording work with Timbaland and Missy Elliott.
Yeah. I have the one in a million album.
Me too! It is great.
It is really terrible what happened to her and her crew. A plane crash is devastating.
I know. It bothers me to think about it.
She was super talented. She had a bright future.
Yeah. Her first album was climbing the billboard charts.
It was certified as double platinum.
That's right! See, she had a bright future.
She graduated from high school the same year I did!
Yeah, in 1997. I didn't realize we were that close in age.
I loved her back and forth song. I love her rock the boat song too.
Yeah! They were great.
My ultimate favorite song she made was called let me know.
Oh! I really love that song too!
