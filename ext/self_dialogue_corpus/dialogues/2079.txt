Hey, how's it going?
Good! What do you think about the Lions this year?
I think they can maintain the momentum from last year.
Yeah, I agree. They didn't lose much and only added some depth around the foundation.
I think their GM is the real deal.
He absolutely is, molded from the Pats foundation, I think he's building something behind the scenes.
I like his drafts too, seems to put in the work to find the diamonds in the rough.
I wasn't so high on his draft this year, seemed to make a lot of reaches.
I feel like those are the ones that have such a high ceiling though.
Elaborate?
The guys that other teams aren't high on, get called reaches, but maybe that's because he's seeing something special that others aren't.
Yeah, maybe...
Seriously, that WR they got in the 3rd, could be a bust, but on the surface, has all the tools you need to be a great redzone target.
Yeah, I guess I could see where you're going with that.
I feel like the best teams play safe early, and then go big in the mid/late rounds, that's really when the draft is won.
I guess only time will tell!
Got that right and hopefully it'll tell us we're going to the Super Bowl!
Haa, we can only hope!
Let's get down the field and gain, a Lion's victory!!
Go Lions!
