Why am I obsessed with JLo's "Ain't that funny? She sounds excellent here.
Because you're crazy. It's a nice song, but it's not that great.
So you don't like JLo? She's a great artist. Are you a hater?
Of course I like her. I'm not taking away that's she's talented . I'm just saying it's not that good.
Do you hear the growl and the confidence? She's grown as an artist.
Yes, and I'm not saying it's a horrible song. It's catchy.
However you don't think it's worthy of my devotion, right? Listen to it again.
Well I'm just giving my opinion. It's a great song, not an anthem.
Okay, we have a difference of opinion. I respect that. You make me want to listen to it more.
That's fine. Just don't go crazy when I don't join in. I'm happy she has a hit.
That's a low blow. She's always been successful. She has great music.
I'm not denying her talent. She's a great dancer.
I wonder if JLo has a gang like Beyonce's Beyhive? What would they be called?
She doesn't, she lost them all after her split with Ben.
You're on a roll with the JLo hate. She's a triple threat.
Maybe it's because of Ja Rule's rap. I don't like his music at all.
Okay I understand that. I don't like him either.
He sounds like a big phony. That voice isn't real.
You're funny. He's washed up now.
I know. Well we might see him on a Geico commercial now.
