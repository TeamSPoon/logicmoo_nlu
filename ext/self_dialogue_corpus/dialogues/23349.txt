How many Vincent Prince films have you seen?
A lot. I'm a huge fan.
Okay, then name them all.
The Fall of the House of Usher, Twice Told Tales, The Fly...
That one was gross.
Don't mess up my concentration. There was Edward Scissorhands....
That was one of his last ones.
Don't distract me. Theater of Blood, Madhouse...
Those were excellent.
The Abominable Dr. Phibes and Dr. Phibes Rises Again.
Now we're getting to the sillier films.
Dr. Goldfoot and the Bikini Machine, and Dr. Goldfoot and the Girl Bombs...
There was no actual bikini machine. But Rob Zombie does reference Dr. Goldfoot in a song.
The Conqueror Worm, Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea, City i n the Sea, Beach Party...
Beach Party? Are you just seeing if I'm paying attention?
No. The Masque of the Red Death, The Haunted Palace, The Last Man on Earth, Tomb of Ligeia, Comedy of Terrors, The Raven, Twice Told Tales...
You already said Twice Told Tales.
Shut up. The Pit and the Pendulum, Master of the World, The Bat, The Tingler, Return of the Fly, House on Haunted Hill, The Ten Commandments....
He was really in the Ten Commandments?
The Mad Magician, House of Wax, Drogonwyck... I know you're making me forget some of them!
