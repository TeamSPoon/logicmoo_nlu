Can you recommend a film to watch on Netflix or On Demand or something? I'm kind of stumped.
What genre are you interested in?
Comedy, I think. I need a pick-me-up.
New or old?
Probably a newer one. I want one that's just going to make me laugh out loud over and over.
Then I recommend "Spy."
"Spy?" That sounds familiar but I don't remember it.
It's with Melissa McCarthy and Jason Statham. It's hilarious.
What's it about?
Melissa McCarthy is kind of like this secret agent assistant but ends up having to go into the field.
Okay, then what?
They keep giving her these aliases of these dowdy, frumpy women and figure she's totally unfit to be a secret agent.
Let me guess: she ends up impressing them?
She does but not without adventures and errors. Seriously, you need to see it. I couldn't stop laughing.
I'll give it a shot. Any other suggestions?
It's an older one but try "Saving Grace" with Brenda Blethyn and Craig Ferguson.
I've never even heard of that one. What's that one about?
Brenda Blethyn is a widow facing eviction until her gardener asks for help growing a marijuana plant.
Okay, that already sounds like it has great potential.
You won't be disappointed.
