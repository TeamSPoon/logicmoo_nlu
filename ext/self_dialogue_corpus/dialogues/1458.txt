Who do you think will be the top contenders this year?
Hard to say, there have been a lot of changes this offseason.
Do you think the Patriots will be in the Superbowl?
Probably, they added Cooks which is a huge weapon.
Yeah, Brady needs to stay healthy.
It is uncommon for someone his age to have great success.
If anyone can do it it is him.
Yes, his exercise and diet routine allow him to live like he is 25.
I heard he goes to bed everyday by 8pm.
That should help him stay healthy.
Even if he is hurt they have some good backups.
I dont know about them, what makes you think they are good?
Do you remember last season when Brady was suspended for the first four games?
Yea, the deflategate punishment.
Right, well Garappolo started and they won several games.
Didnt Garappolo get hurt though?
Yes against Miami at home, but Brissett came in and they won that game.
Well I would say they have some pretty good backup quarterbacks then.
Thats why they are going to the Superbowl again this year.
I dont know, but if they make it they will probably win it.
