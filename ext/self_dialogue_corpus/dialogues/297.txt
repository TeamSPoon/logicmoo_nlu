I saw that new 'Wonder Woman' movie at the weekend.
Oh yeah? Was it good?
It was, actually. I had kind of low expectations but it was great.
You had low expectations?
I just didn't really care to see it, but it really impressed me.
It's been getting amazing reviews.
I'm not usually one for female superheroes, but Gal Gadot did a great job playing Wonder Woman.
I've never heard of her before.
Me neither, but I think she'll be huge after this. I'd recommend seeing it.
I love superhero movies so I'll be sure to see it, thanks!
