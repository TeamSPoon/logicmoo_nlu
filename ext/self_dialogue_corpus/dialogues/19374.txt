Do you have a favorite metal musician?
Of course. I'm a huge fan of Corey Taylor.
He's a singer, right? I've heard his name before.
Yeah. He performs in Slipknot and Stone Sour.
Got it. Why do you like him?
First of all, because he's very outspoken.
How do you mean?
He has a very loud opinion of just about anything, and he's not afraid to speak it.
That's admirable, I guess. Any other reason why you're a fan?
Because of his singing ability. It's amazing.
Does he have a wide range or something?
Exactly that. He can go from sounding like a maniac to sounding like an angel in a second.
I'm going to need some proof of this.
Okay. For some straight up crazy vocals, look up Eyeless by Slipknot.
That sounds uncomfortable. Okay, now what else?
For some absolutely beautiful vocals, try Snuff by Slipknot.
It's by the same band?
Yes, but it's very different from their normal stuff, and in a good way.
Okay then. I'll give them a try.
You won't be disappointed.
