Hey!  Have you seen Doctor Strange?
No.  Is it good?
Definitely.  If you like Superhero movies, you'll love it.
Why?
The story is awesome.  It's about a doctor who gets into an accident, discovers magic, and becomes the protector of Earth.
That sounds cool.
Yeah.  He fights a God, outsmarts him, and defeats him!
That's really impressive.
It is.  It's a great movie.
I'll have to watch it some time.
