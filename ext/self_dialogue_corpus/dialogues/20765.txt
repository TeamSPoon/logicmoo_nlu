I hated Cars 3.
You did? Why?
I could never shake the sense that everything was simulated.
Yes, it is difficult to care about computer generated characters.
The presence of celebrity voices made it all even more unreal.
Well, it is just a kid's movie.
So kids want to see 90 minute stories about violence and giving up at the last minute?
I'm not saying that. Celebrities lend credibility to movie projects in my view.
For me, story comes first.
Yeah, but I don't see why you would hate rather than just dislike or feel neutral about Cars 3.
Come on! Pixar used to set a standard of innovation and humanity in art and storytelling.
I think if you look back on their earlier films, they were quite shallow and haven't aged well.
I just don't know what is wrong with movies anymore. A world of infinite possibilities just recycles everything.
I know. And we, the public, are expected to get excited about sequels to sequels.
If I made a Cars movie, it would not be about race cars.
What's wrong with race cars?
They are obviously meant to serve as merchandising hooks for young audiences.
I see. And what is bad about merchandising? It's a free country.
Toys often supplant rather than inspire imagination.
I guess you're one of those people who believes movies should be purely on the screen.
