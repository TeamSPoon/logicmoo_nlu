shuggie by foxygen is such a classic
i've never heard it
really? foxygen is easily one of the most iconic indie bands of all time!
i think i know the name
you might know them from a song called lariat. they namedropped the band, so even if you haven't heard the awesome that is foxygen you might know the name...
can you hum a little tune for me?
no way! if you don't know shuggie, you probably don't know a foxygen song
it sounds like oxygen
i think it's a play on words. shuggie is great, though. just listen to the drum line real quick
you're right, that's pretty kickin'
