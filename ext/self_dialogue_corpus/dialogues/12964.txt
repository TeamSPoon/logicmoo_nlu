Do you think Boba Fett died too easily in 'Return of the Jedi?'
Yes, definitely.  He is supposed to be the most dangerous Bounty Hunter in the galaxy.
Exactly.  Yet, his death was almost comical.
Yes, it was very much a gag.  They built up Boba's reputation way too much for it to end that way.
Also, if you think about it, he really didn't get that much total screen time.
Come to think of it, you're right.  In fact, Jango from the prequel series got way more screen time.
I wish we could have seen more of Boba.
I think it says a lot about the iconic nature of the character, by the fact that despite his few appearances, he's so recognizable.
I agree.  They probably could have done so much more with the character.
Perhaps we'll get a standalone Boba Fett movie one day.
