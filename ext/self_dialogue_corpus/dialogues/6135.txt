What do you think Disney's biggest movie of the 90s was?
I don't know.  Probably either Aladdin or Pocahontas.
Yeah, I'm sure it'd be either one of those two.
Did you know that Aladdin had a sequel or two?
Was it good?
I never saw it.  It was straight to video.
How did you know about it?
My little sister had it.
I wonder if they used the same voices.
I don't know.  That's a good question.
