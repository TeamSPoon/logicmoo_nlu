Have you seen any of the Star Wars movies?
Yes, I've seen all of them. Except for Revenge of the Sith.
Seriously? You have to see that one.
Which one is your favorite?
Believe it or not, I actually love the older ones. I think Empire Strikes Back is my favorite.
Is that the one where Luke finds out Darth Vader is his father?
Yes. Do you think they're going to make more movies?
Definitely. I heard there's going to be a new on in 2019.
That is awesome.
I know. I can't wait.
