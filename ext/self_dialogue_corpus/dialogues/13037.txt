Have you seen the new Star Wars Movie?
I haven't gotten the chance to see it yet.
You should definitely see it soon. Mark Hamill and Harrison Ford are great in it.
What is the new one called?
It is called Star Wars: The Force Awakens.
I will definitely make sure to check it out.
This movie gave me hope for the new era of Star Wars movies.
I know, I wasn't sure they would ever be as good as the originals.
Same here but I really enjoyed this one and would love to see it again.
Let's watch it together sometime!
