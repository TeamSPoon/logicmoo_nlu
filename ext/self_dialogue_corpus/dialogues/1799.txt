What do you think of the Colts?
I think they're an above average team.
I think they're better than that.
Maybe, I think they're still too young.
That's a good point.
I think they can grow though.
Do you think they could ever be a superbowl team?
Definitely maybe in another five years.
Think it will really take that long?
I do, they're young and inexperienced.
Can't Andrew Luck just carry the team?
He's not experienced enough to do that yet.
Do you think Luck could be as good as manning?
I don't think so Manning is just too good.
Do you think he could be as good as say Favre?
yes in skill, for sure.
Do you think he could break any records.
Anything is possible.
I like him and hope he grows.
I agree a lot.
