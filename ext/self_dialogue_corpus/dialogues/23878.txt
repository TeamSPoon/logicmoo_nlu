What did you think of the latest Pirates of the Caribbean movie?
Oh, I loved Dead Men Tell No Tales! I thought it was great!
Oh yes, me too! I felt like it was on par with the original.
Definitely. Especially after the last one which was pretty disappointing.
Yes, and what I really loved is that we see an influx of new characters.
I liked that too. Because I think they breathed some new life into the movie.
Plus, we also get to see Elizabeth Swann and Will Turner again! I was so excited about that.
Me too! There is no Pirates of the Caribbean without their characters.
I totally agree. This movie has something for everyone. A bit of the old and the new.
At two hours and nine minutes, this has the shortest running time of all the Pirates of the Caribbean movies.
Indeed, it did feel shorter while I was watching it too.
But I honestly couldn't feel the time passing. It's been six years since the last Pirates of the Caribbean movie.
Yes, it's been a long wait for all the fans.
Yes, it's the largest gap between any of the Pirates of the Caribbean films.
It was great to see Paul McCartney playing an interesting cameo!
Yes, I really enjoyed seeing him in this movie!
There were some sad moments during the movie too, don't you think?
Yes there were. i found myself shedding a few tears on a couple of ocassions at least.
But plenty of humor and funny dialogue too!
Yes, wasn't it wonderful? I really loved this movie.
