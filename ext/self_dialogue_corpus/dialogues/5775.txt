pocahontas is completely underrated. the movie, i mean. and the character!
you think so?
yeah, i do! more people need to watch it
why? the message isn't all that great, it's not very historically accurate...
the music is beautiful and does have a great message!
i guess you're right. protecting the earth is important these days
it's always been important. and how could you forget the iconic line: 'these white people are dangerous'?
okay, that's keeping it pretty real
the worst thing about the movies is john smith
but we can just ignore him, i guess
