Hey, what are you listening to?
Metallica
Metallica is horrible!
Not their old stuff!
True that - it's decent
Yea this is Kill Em All
Oh their oldest album
Yea this is where they were at their best
I totally agree!
I hate their new stuff
I hear that!
I literally have all the old Metallica CDs but stopped after the Black Album
Yea I used to have them.  But I don't know where my cds are now
Oh, yea I have mine in storage
I probably should find mine
Yea, they'l prob be worth something some day
Good call!
I gotta run though!
Good talk man!
Later!
