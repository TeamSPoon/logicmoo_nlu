Hey, have you seen any good movies lately?
Ya I watched through the Matrix trilogy the last few nights.
How are they? I've never seen them before but people always talk about them.
They are some of my favorite movies of all time.
What makes them so good?
When The Matrix came out it was a trendsetter when it comes to graphics and CGI.
Things have really advanced since then huh?
Yea they have but for when the movies were made these graphics were innovative in a lot of ways.
How about the rest of the movie?
The story line was amazing in a lot of aspects. I think it's better than the action parts.
How do you mean?
Well the story has a lot of symbolism in it and there are a lot of different themes going on at once.
OK, that sounds like my kind of the movie!
Ya I'm sure you would like it. A lot of the themes have shallow meanings as well as deeper things that go over most people head.
I love a movie that can make me think. Do you think it would be OK for my son to watch it with me?
Yea I think he would like it too. There are themes that a kid can handle and it will keep him entertained.
Cool. We will have to check it out later.
You might have to explain a few things to him if he doesn't understand though.
That's not a problem, he's pretty smart. Thanks for giving me some information on it.
Not a problem. I hope you guys enjoy.
