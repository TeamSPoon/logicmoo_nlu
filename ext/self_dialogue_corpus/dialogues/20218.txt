I swear I could watch "Interview with a Vampire" everyday. I love that movie!
I didn't care for Brad Pitt in that movie at all.
Why not? I think he done a great job in his role as Louie.
I really wasn't crazy about Tom Cruise as Lestat either.
I agree there, Tom did ok, but I think Stuart Townsend did a better job as Lestat in Queen of the Damned.
Definately. I feel he had more charisma on screen in that role than Cruise did.
I wonder, characterwise, if Lestat missed Louie and in that found a shred of humanity , thus his need to be famous.
I think that was more to spite Marius.
I think the scene where they wall Louie up is a homage to Poe.
How is that a homage to Poe?
It is a scene from the short story  "Cask of the Amandillado"
I never thought of that, but could be for sure.
Louie just seemed too whiny, and Pitt always looked so mournful, like there was no celebration in him at all.
That is why Lestat got him that lil girl, that and he had lost his wife and baby in child birth, he mourned his family. Lestat made him a new one.
So what did you think for the little girl?
I think she played her character very well. She embodied Lestat better than cruise did.
I wish they hadn't killed her off.
yeah it would have been more twisted if she had come back as the chic from the Illuminate
yeah that would have been awesome, but I think Pitt done an ok job.
I prefer him in other roles. I just don't think he would have been my first choice for Louie.
