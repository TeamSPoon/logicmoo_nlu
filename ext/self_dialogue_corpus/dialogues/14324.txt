The Cavaliers are much better than the Celtics.
Yes, that is true.
Lebron is in his prime and Irving just makes them better.
Do not forget Kevin Love.
The Warriors are good too.
Yes they are. Durant is great.
Do not forget Curry.
Yeah, he's great too.
I wonder if Lebron will get a second straight title.
I think so. He is the best player.
What do you think of the Clippers?
They are unfortunate.
Yeah, I think they care more about clubs than they do basketball.
I think they might just play for the money.
Yeah, they always choke at the end.
Do you think Leonard will be back?
Yes, but not this year.
Do you think the Warriors will sweep the Spurs?
Definitely. The Spurs are too shorthanded.
Maybe next year for the Spurs.
