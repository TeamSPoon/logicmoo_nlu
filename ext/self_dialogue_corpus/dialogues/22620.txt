Remember THE GOONIES?
That is my favorite movie.
It was released in 1985.
It is a comedy.
But there was also adventure in it.
It was directed by Richard Donner.
He also produced it.
Steven Speilburg wrote it.
It had many actors in it.
Yes, it had all those kids.
There was Sean Astin.
And also Josh Brolin.
And also Jeff Cohen.
I liked Corey Feldman.
Kerri Green was in it.
And I think also Martha Plimpton.
The music was by Dave Grusin.
The budget was $19 million.
It made $61 million.
It is a classic 1980's movie.
