Did you see the Oscars last night?
Yeah but I hadn't seen one movie on that list.
They don't always give it to the best actor, I always wonder what motivates them to select a winner
Weren't you surprised years ago when they selected Marissa Tomei in My Cousin Vinny?
Oh God, that was a funny movie!  She was great in that!
It was really unusual because it was a comedy and she was virtually unknown at that point.
Oh, her performance was perfect!  I get mesmerized watching the tiny nuances in her movements and accent.
I thought the actors were both from the east coast?
I guess but she doesn't talk that way normally.
Who ever did costumes on that movie hit her outfits right on the nail.
Ha Ha, that skin tight body suit with the flowers all over that!  Who wears something like that?
Mona Lisa Vito!  (laughing)
You remember the judge?  The guy that was Herman Munster?
That was him?  I knew I remembered seeing that face!  I just didn't put two and two together.
What's a Yute?!
TWO YUTES!  (Laughing)
That was such a funny movie!
Did you know Joe Pecsi just won the Oscar for Goodfellas during making Vinny?
Really?  Wow!  That was a good film too!  What a different role!
I think both of those movies were great!
