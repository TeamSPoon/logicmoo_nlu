Hey, do you listen to 50 cent?
I've heard him a little bit but not too much.  Why do you ask?
I've been listening to him a lot lately and I think his music is great!
Isn't Eminem playing with him or something?
Eminem and Dr. Dre produced him and made him famous.
Yeah, that's what I meant.
Yeah, and he was invited to tour with Nas.
Wow, that's a big honor.  What are some of his hits?
In da Club is probably the one most people have heard.
Oh yeah, that was from the Get Rich or Die Tryin' album, right?
Yeah, and it was pretty famous!
Yeah, definitely.
But you've probably heard Candy Shop, too.  And maybe How We Do.
I've definitely heard Candy Shop.  I didn't know that was 50 Cent.
It is.  He's in some movies as well.
Yeah, I know I'd definitely seen him in some movies.
Yeah, and New Day has Dr. Dre and Alicia Keys in it.  That's one of his newer ones.
I definitely haven't heard that one yet.
Yeah, that's one to look out for.  And his newest should be released soon if it hasn't already yet.
I will look for it!
