I watched It's A Wonderful Life last night for the first time.
Oh cool what did you think?
I liked it overall but I just can't get into old movies for some reason.
What's the problem?
I'm not sure if it's the way people acted back then or if I just can't get into black and white film.
Stories are stories no matter what.
While that's true the way they are presented can still get to me, you know?
Without being confrontational yeah I know what you're saying.
For example I don't read a lot because I can't use my imagination as well, so I turn to movies.
But It's A Wonderful Life is a movie.
Yeah, and a really good one, but it was an example based around how things are presented.
I see what you're saying, though I have some recommendations of older films you might like.
I'd rather you not because I likely won't get to them.
Well back to It's A Wonderful Life, what did you think of the story?
I loved the idea of it and it's an absolute classic.
I am glad you agree with that at least.
But again I just can't get into black and white.
Everyone is different I suppose.
And the way everyone talks like they're trying to sleuth a case.
Okay now you're just being funny.
