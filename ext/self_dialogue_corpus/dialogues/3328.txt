I watched the movie "Devil's Rejects" last night.
Oh, I have seen that, Rob Zombie at his best, I've watched it three times.
Yes, what a crazy show that was, I loved it!  My favorite character is Captain Spaulding.
He's great, isn't he?  Come and get my FRIED CHICKEN!
Did you notice that the actor from the Hills Have Eyes has a small role in the film?
Yep, that's Micheal Berryman, and boy is he ugly, but what a perfect mug for a horror movie!
I thought the use of "Freebird" at the end of the movie when they are in the car was perfect.
Yes, Zombie always uses songs well, the Allman Bros. song at the beginning of the show was so cool.
I'm going to have to watch this movie again,  I have a feeling there are plenty of things I missed!
Yes, play close attention and oh yeah, next time you get ice cream, make sure its Tutti effing Frutti!
