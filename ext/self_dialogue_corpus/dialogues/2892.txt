Do you think the Pats are going to the Superbowl again this year?
I certainly hope not, I am so sick of them.
So am I , all their cheating.
I would really like to see a team be in the Superbowl that have never been there
Well, I would like to see the Packers in it.
So would I, but if not them, then maybe the Lions.
Yeah, I don't think they have ever been in the Superbowl.
No they haven't, neither have the Browns, Jaquars, or Texans
So it looks like the Lions are the only NFC team that has never played in the Superbowl
Yup, all the others are in the AFC
Who would you want in the Superbowl half time show
I don't know, I think Train would be cool
Ok, I like Five for Fighting or Sugar Ray
Yeah, they would be good also
Well, who do you like is going to come on top in the NFC North
I think it's going to be Packers, Vikings, Lions and Bears
LOL, I always want to say, "Oh My" after that.
LOL, I do too.
I think that the Packers will be in second place for awhile and then come out on top at the last minute.
Isn't that what they always seem to do.
