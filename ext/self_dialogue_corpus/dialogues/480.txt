Do you think the Patriots will win another Super With Brady and Bill Belichick?
I almost thing I would be surprised if they didn't.
Yeah, them seem to be unstopable.
For real. And what's amazing is that they really don't have a team full of superstars.
Yeah, just a bunch of role players to surround Tom and Bill.
I know people love to hate on them all the time. But I don't see how people can get that upset that they can keep winning.
I think people are convinced that they are cheaters.
Oh yeah! Deflate-gate add what was that other issue they had?
There was the thing a few years ago where they were accused of spying on other teams.
Oh yeah, that was it. I could not remember what it was.
Do you think they were quilty?
If they were, which I don't think the were, then they were only quilty of doing what all the teams do.
Yeah, it kind of seems like the media is out to get them.
That is kind of how I feel. No one wants to give them credit so they just vilify them and everyone buys into it.
That's too bad because they really are a great team. And that's what I think matters, great teams competing against each other.
No doubt! And I think the league is full of some really great teams now.
Me too. And there were a lot of key player pick ups in the league with the draft.
It wil be interesting to see which rookies really come out and make a huge difference for their teams.
It sure will, but you can count on this. Whoever are playing for the Patriots will have a great show at a championship with Tom and Bill at the helm.
That is for sure!
