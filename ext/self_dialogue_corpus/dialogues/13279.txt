Hi, I like all Star Wars Movies except the prequels?
Really? I think the prequel series are just as good as the others.
Ha! You are a fool, the prequels are the worst and people who like them are dumb!
Well, I actually think they are the smartest of the series, in terms of the plot. The Phantom Menace, for instance has true political intrigue.
But Jar Jar is awful.
Jar Jar is no worse than the ewoks, or even Chewbacca. You just like Chewie more because because he can shoot a gun.
The acting is awful, though, just horrible!
Are you telling me that Mark Hamill was not a whiny little brat as Luke Skywalker? He was just shrill and awful.
But George Lucas ruined the original series to try to make the prequels better.
No, he owns them and made his original vision a reality after years of being patient.
