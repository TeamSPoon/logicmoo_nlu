Do you listen to Insane Clown Posse?
No way, I think that is garbage!
Seriously?  They're hilarious!
They're disgusting, them and that band Twiztid if you could even call it a band.
I've been listening to them for years.  It's supposed to be funny, not offensive.
Well, to me it's offensive.  I've never heard of Twiztid but if they're anything like ICP I don't want to hear them.
You're being too uptight.  You're taking it too seriously.
It is serious!  I'd much prefer listen to something low key and mellow.
Their music hypes me up!
That's just the thing.  I like to be calm.
Well, then I guess they're not a good fit for you.  What are you listening to?
Mostly country and some oldies.  Stuff that's very different from what you're listening to.
Yeah, I'd say.  What kind of oldies?
I like Al Green and Teddy Pendergrass, soul music like that.
Oh yeah, that is some really old stuff.  I can't get down with it.
Well, it calms me and makes me feel relaxed.
I guess we have different motivations for listening to music.
Totally.  I want to be wound down.
I want to be wound up.  I like hip hop mostly.
I can't stand it.
