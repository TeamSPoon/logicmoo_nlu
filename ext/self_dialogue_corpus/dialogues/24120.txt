Have you seen the sequel to Alice in Wonderland?
Yes, I have watched Alice Through the Looking Glass. I'm a huge fan.
I also love Tim Burton's work. It's so imaginative and ethereal. Though he only produced this one.
This one was a bit sad too as it was Alan Rickman's last film.
That is sad. Did he get to watch it before he died?
No, he passed away four months prior to the film's release.
I'm guessing he was the voice of Absolem again?
Yes, that's right. The movie is dedicated to him.
I do know that this film marks the ninth time Tim Burton has collaborated with Johnny Depp.
That is a lot! I guess it must be because they both have a good rapport and understanding.
Which is your favorite character in Through The Looking Glass?
I would have to say the character of Time. I thought he was very unique and original.
Yes, I liked him too. I thought he was a very endearing character.
I'm surprised this movie didn't do as well in the box office.
Yes, I remember hearing about that. It surprised me too.
The opening gross at the U.S. box-office was 77 percent less.
That's a lot. I wonder why so many people didn't go to watch it?
A good question. I'm not sure. I just know that I loved it.
Do you think there will be a third film?
I hope so. I think a trilogy would be great!
