Have you heard of Carley Rae Jepsen?
Yeah, she sang Call Me Maybe, I remember that song.
What do you think of it?
It's pretty corny. Some people say it's catchy but I don't see it.
Well, she has done other stuff, it couldn't hurt to check her other stuff out.
I'll give her other stuff a listen one of these days.
I don't recommend It Takes Two. The original was a great rap song, but this version isn't very good.
Remakes don't tend to be as good as the originals, though.
There have been some, though, that were pretty good.
I remember Tainted Love being one of the exceptions.
