Hey, have you seen any good movies lately?
I haven't seen any adult movies.
What do yo ean?
The only movies I see lately are kids movies.
I love animated movies. What have you seen?
I took my daughter to see Boss Baby the other day.
How was it?
It was cute, but a little boring.
Did your daughter like it?
Yes, she loved the little baby.
I saw the new Guardians of the Galaxy yesterday.
Oh, I want to see that.
You should, it was really good.
I heard a  lot of good reviews about it.
Yes and chris Helmsworth is very good in it.
I love him  too!
I really liked the first, so figured I should see the second.
I thought the first was really good too. Maybe i should watch it again.
Let me know, I would love to see it with you.
Great, I will.
