Did you see Dr Strange?
Yeah, that movie was awesome.
I didn't get a chance to see it. Who's in it.
Benedict Cumberbatch is Dr Strange. He steals the show.
Oh, he's that Sherlock Holmes guy right?
Yes, among other things.
Yeah I liked him in Star Trek as well.
Yeah, well he does a great job as Dr Strange. Fits the persona really well.
Okay, I guess I'll have to check it out.
Yeah, really cool special effects as well.
Oh yeah, I'm always for the effects.
And it's pretty comical in it as well.
Yeah, most of those new marvel movies are pretty funny at times.
Well, some are pretty corny. Take the Avengers
Oh I loved that movie.
Yeah, some of the one-liners were a bit much for me.
No way, they were classic lines.
Most of it was cheap humor.
Well we'll have to disagree on that one.
Okay, but in the end I'll have to check out Dr Strange.
