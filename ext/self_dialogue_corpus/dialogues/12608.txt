Who is your favorite character in the Star Wars movies?
I like the Hans Solo character.
Oh, you like the rebel bad boy with a good heart?
Yes, I like the tough guy persona of Han.
I like his relationship with Chewy and Princess Leia
Me too and what about the ship?
Too funny I like how it is always broken down.
The millennium falcon  was always breaking down but always managed to get the job at the last minute.
Too funny how they were always cobbling it back together.
Yes, great addition to the story line.
