Who was your favorite Harry Potter character?
I liked Luna.
She definitely had personality.
I think she was a good role model for young people.
She was always marching to a different beat.
I think that was her strength, though, that she accepted her role in society with poise.
Her upbringing had to be odd, without a mom and with an oddball dad.
I imagine she was happy enough, even if she lived her life mostly in fantasy.
I think Rowling used her to exemplify being true to yourself.
Yes, but I would like to have seen her stand up for herself to the bullies sometimes instead of just accepting it.
