Thoughts on the AFC West? Should be competitive this season.
Agreed. This should be a tough division this year.
A lot of quality teams in this division, some seem to be on the precipice of being powerhouses.
I don't know about powerhouses, but there are a few teams that should be really good.
We have to see how the additions from the draft and free agency impact the balance of power.
I like the Chiefs a lot this year. I think the combination of the defense and efficiency are what puts them a shade above the field.
Good point. Defense is becoming more rare in this league.
Plus, it just seems like the team is due. You look at their record over the past two years and see how underrated they are.
True, but they always disappoint when the big game comes along.
Denver also has the defense, but seems like they are starting to slide.
Maybe. But a solid defense gives you the ability to hold things together until the offense can develop a rhythm. I'd have to look at their schedule.
Maybe Paxton Lynch shows some growth and they can surprise us.
It seems like they've shifted quite a few things around on offense that doesn't make it easy for him.
You want to talk about QB play, it's hard to ignore the Raiders with Carr.
Hard to get a read on the Raiders, not sure if they just had a lot of luck and good bounces last year before Carr's injury or if that is legitimate.
Seems like Del Rio really put some fight in them and Carr just developed into a machine.
The Raiders defense is the big question mark. They are actually on the right track for once and drafted pretty well but not sure how much defensive help they'll get right away.
Fair. Plus we've yet to see whether or not Carr is 100% after the leg injury.
Signed that record-breaking big money contract, I don't think they'd put pen to paper if the leg wasn't healed. Then again it is the Raiders.
Ha. Good point. Should be a battle in the west.
