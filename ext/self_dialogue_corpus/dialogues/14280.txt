Well the Finals are almost here, who ya got?
Golden State and it's not even close.
Not even close? You don't think LeBron can give them a series.
Cleveland might get a game or two but the trophy is moving back out west this year.
See I think it's a lot closer than you think.  Maybe even the Rockets can challenge Golden State.
The Rockets won't even make it past San Antonio.
That is really sad when a bunch of old guys can hang with the young guns.
Shows just how good of a coach Pop is.  Always gets the best out of his players.
I just think if Houston can get through, they have a chance of outscoring the Warriors.
A lot of teams have a chance, but they rarely do.
True, true.  Boston or Washington in the Eastern semis?
I think Boston will take it now. They looked impressive out there tonight and I don't see them losing at TD Garden.
I think so too, it will go 7 though for sure.
Yeah if Washington had home court advantage I'd lean their way.
Such a close series but none of the games have been particularly tight except Game 2.
Kind of crazy.  That's why neither has a chance against the Cavs.
I think there's more than one reason but I gotcha.
Should be interesting, we'll have to wait and see.
Yeah I'm looking forward to it.
Me too.
