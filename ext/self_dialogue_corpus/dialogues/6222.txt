How was the new Beauty and the Beast movie?
I haven't seen the new Disney one yet, just the older animated Disney one.
Oh, okay.  I heard good things about the new live action one.
With Emma Watson?  The previews looked good.
Yeah, loved the sets. Emma Watson makes a good Belle.
I think so too. Is the new version a musical?
I think so, like the animated one.
Wonder if it has the same songs.
Its hard to say.  Looks like they spent a lot of money on it.
Very true.  I'm excited to see it.
