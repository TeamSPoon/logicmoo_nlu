Check out those earings.
They're super cool. I love interesting earrings.
I want a pair like that.
It says here they came from Claire's so let's go look for some.
I love Claire's.
Me too. Their jewelry is great.
They have excellent hair accessories too.
I like those big claw clips.
So do I. I also like stretchy headbands.
You look cute in those.
Thanks. I love how they hold my hair in place.
I have an orange one you may have.
That one with the flower?
Yes, that.
I love that.
Well, I don't wear it so it's yours.
Thanks so much. If you like my butterfly earrings you can have those. I don't wear them.
I love butterfly stuff.
I know you do and it's not my thing really.
I love trading fashion accessories with you. It's fun.
