Have you ever seen Shaun of the Dead.
Yeah! Great movie!
Huh, I'd never heard of it till just now.
You have to watch it!
"A romantic comedy with Zombies"?!
Not so much on the romance side. Heavy on the zombies though.
I'm not really into zombies.
It's a total spoof. You have to see it.
OK. I'll give it a shot.
You won't be dissapointed!
