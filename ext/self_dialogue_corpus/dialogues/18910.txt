No matter what I do... I just do not like Neil Young.
WHAT!?
I know, that's how people respond every single time that I say that. I just can't come around.
You listened to After the Gold Rush?
Yep.
What about Harvest?
Mhm.
What is wrong with you?
His stuff is just not for me.
But what exactly don't you like about it?
Uh, like everything.
Nope, it can't be everything.
Okay, fine. For starters... his voice sounds like a crying cat.
I'll give that to you. At first I couldn't enjoy his voice.
Are you saying it's an "acquired taste?"
You're being sarcastic. But it totally is. For me at least, it took me hearing how great his songs were, and how authentic he is as an artist. Then I was listening for the melodies. Then I found myself all of a sudden liking his voice.
That sounds like it's just you trying to get it because other people say he's good.
No! He doesn't have a classically "good" voice, but he's a great singer anyway.
I just all respect for you.
Play his song "After the Gold Rush" a few times. You'll love him the next time I see you.
