Hey, did you hear any more about Mariota?
What about?
You know, his injury. He broke his leg or something, remember?
Oh, yeah, I'm sure he'll be good by the season start though. He's young and all.
Yeah, not like Brady or something. he's getting old.
Speaking of getting old, you think Palmer is gonna play another season?
As far as I know...and Fitz too.
Maybe their last. I'd like to see them get the Superbowl rings though.
You mean Arizona?
Yup, I think the Cardinals deserve a big win.
I kind of like them, too. Tired of seeing the same teams over and over...
I hear you! No more Patriots or Steelers!
Ugh, can't stand either one of them!
I also kind of want to see the Vikings win...
No way! I'm a bit of a cheesehead so I can't root for the Vikings!
Oh, no! No cheesehead!!
What you don't like Arron Roger's and his hail mary's?
Well he is impressive at that for sure. But no, I don't care for the packers!
Well, then just settle for no Patriots and Steelers.
Sounds good...and Go Cards!!
