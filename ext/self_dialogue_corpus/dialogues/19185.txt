Have you heard Metallica's new album?
I haven't! Is it any good?
It's amazing! The songs sound really heavy.
That's good, I didn't really care for their last album.
Yeah it wasn't my favorite, but the new one is great.
What is your favorite song off the album?
I really like Spit out the bone.
Does it have any guitar solos?
Sure does, and Lars goes crazy on the drums.
I heard Lars isn't as good as he used to be.
Well they are getting pretty old.
I can't believe they still tour at their age!
Well the Rolling Stones are still going!
Very true. I hope they continue to make music.
I'm sure they will write more in the future.
They like to take long breaks don't they?
Yeah it takes them a while to come out with a new album.
Sometimes it's better that way. It makes better music.
I agree. Take the time to write good songs!
Sure thing! I'll have to check out the new album.
