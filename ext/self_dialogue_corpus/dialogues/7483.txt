We had a Harry Potter movie marathon this weekend.
That sounds like it was fun.
It was and it was relaxing too.
I need to do more of that kind of binge watching.
It makes all of the movies make sense when you watch them in order.
I think that is so true.
I love this series because the story is complex.
I think it works well with following Harry's Hogwart years.
Yes that takes talent to record them and make the actors seem like not a lot has passed.
I imagine that they all became very close when recording the movie.
