What's your favorite type of movie?
I don't really have a favorite. I like a lot of different types.
Is there any certain movie that you like in particular?
I'd say the movie I've watched the most is Major League. I really do like it a lot.
What is that movie about?
This group of baseball players that aren't very good end up doing really well to spite their owner. It's really funny.
Do you like a lot of comedy movies?
Yes. It has to be one of my favorite genres.
Are there any other comedies that you really like?
I do like the movie Step Brothers.
That's the one with Will Ferrel in it, isn't it?
Yeah. He's a grown up who lives with his mom. His mom then meets a man who also has a grown up son living with him.
Yeah. I've see that one. There are a lot of quotable scences in that one.
Tell me about it. I heard they might be making a sequel.
That'd be a good one, but I'm not sure where they would go from where things ended in the first one.
Yeah. That confused me as well.
Have you watched any of Adam Sandler's movies that premiere on Netflix.
Yes I have. Some of them were pretty enjoyable, but I hated the one that was supposed to be a western.
I couldn't watch that one from beginnning to end. It just wasn't that funny.
The movie he did on there with David Spade was pretty funny though.
