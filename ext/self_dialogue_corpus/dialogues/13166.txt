Do you feel like The Last Jedi will be a good one?
That's the new Star Wars, I take it?
It is. Do you think it'll be good?
Well, the last two films were solid, so I'd say it should be as well.
I'm curious to see what they're going to do with Leia's character.
Wait, she's still in it? Didn't Carrie Fisher pass recently?
Yes, she did, but she still filmed the movie beforehand. That's why I want to see what happens.
Oh. Do you think they'll send her off somehow?
I'm honestly not sure what to expect.
Understandable.I'll definitely watch to see what happens.
