Everyone seems to have a different opinion on their favorite Beatles album.
Yeah, I know a lot of people who love The White Album, but I prefer Abbey Road.
Really? Me too!
Yeah, "Something" is one of the most beautiful songs I've ever heard in my life.
Didn't George Harrison write that one?
Yes, he wrote it for his wife, Pattie Boyd. Both John Lennon and Paul McCartney considered it to be the best song on the entire album.
I'd have to agree with them!
Another great song from that album is "Here Comes the Sun".
Oh yeah, I love that one.
Me too. It always makes me feel better when I'm having a bad day.
