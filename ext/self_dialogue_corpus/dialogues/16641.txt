Do you like One Direction?
I do, actually.
Me too! Well, I did at least.
You did?
Well, since they're no longer together....
What??? I thought it was just a break!
Nope, I'm pretty sure they're over for good.
No! I can't believe it.
I know, it's so sad.
Yeah but doesn't this happen to every boyband anyway?
Pretty much, everyone dies out eventually.
Backstreet Boys, Nsync, now One Direction....
Maybe they'll get back together eventualyl!
Doubt it, but a reunion concert in the future would be so cool.
Agreed! I would buy tickets so fast.
Me too!
Well if they ever do come back, do you want to go together?
Yes, of course!
Great, well it's a future date!
Haha thank you One Direction!
