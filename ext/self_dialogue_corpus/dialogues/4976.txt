Did you see the game between the Giants and Dodgers last night?
Yes.  It was a big game between rivals.
Yes, I always try to catch those big rivalry games.
The Giants won, right?
Yes.  I think they've won four straight games now.
Interesting.  They have not looked good for most of the season.
No they haven't.  But they started getting some players back from the DL.
I heard.  They got Crawford back, right?
Yes. He's a good player so that is important.
And Buster Posey is hitting home runs all of a sudden.
Yea, I saw something that said he hit just one home run in April and six already in May.
That's pretty amazing, he's not a guy known for huge power.
No, especially in that ballpark.  But he's off to a great season offensively.
He is a former MVP, so that is to be expected.
What do you think about the Dodgers so far this season?
Honestly I thought they would be just a bit better, but it's still early.
Do you think they are still the favorites in the NL West?
Yes.  The Rockies look good, but I think in the end the Dodgers will win.
What about the Giants?
No way.  They dug themselves too deep a hole already, in my opinion.
