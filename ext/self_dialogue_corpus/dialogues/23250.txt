What do you think of the Star Trek reboot?
Overall I liked it a lot. What about you?
I thought it was pretty good overall.
Zachary Quinto did a good job as Spock.
I thought so too, though I wasn't as convinced by Simon Pegg's portrayal of Scotty.
He was good comic relief though.
I suppose that's fair.
One thing I thought was a little over-the-top was how much lens flare there was.
Well, it's a JJ Abrams movie, what do you expect?
I recently heard that with digital recording, lens flare doesn't even happen anymore and it's all added in afterwards.
I had not heard that; that's interesting.
I'm not sure how much the physics made sense.
Maybe they just didn't disguise it well enough with jargon.
What did you think about the alternate universe and time travel aspect with old Spock?
I was glad that there was that nod to the original series.
I agree.
Leonard Nimoy did a great job as old Spock, too.
It was an interesting plot twist.
Have you seen the other movies that have come out in the rebooted universe?
No, I have not yet.
