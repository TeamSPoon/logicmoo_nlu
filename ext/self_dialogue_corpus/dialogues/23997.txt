Have you seen the new trailers for the Thor movie.
That one is called Ragnarok right?
Yes, it is set off of the Earth.
I love that his story arc always had a bit of magic.
I wish Odin would have had more of a plot line.
I thought Anthony Hopkins was such a great Odin.
You know Hulk will be in this one?
I can not wait to see how in the world he got there.
You mean the other side of the universe?
Yes, I think he is the best part of the Avengers.
I liked that his story is a bit more in depth than the others.
I like all the back stories of the Avengers.
Bruce Banner has sort of the saddest one.
I wonder if his story will be based on one of the other stand alone movies about the Hulk.
Well, there are two so it would be hard to know.
I hope they just remake his story for the Avengers.
Do you think they will ever let him find love?
No, I think they will just keep him with a sad story.
Do you think this version of the Hulk will get his own movie?
Probably not, I think every one would just be done, too many versions.
