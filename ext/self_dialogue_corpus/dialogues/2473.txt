Do you know much about the NFL mascots?
I know some don't have official mascots and that some are really weird.
You are right, the Red Skins, obviously because of political correctness.
Who else? And why don't theses others have official mascots.?
The Green Bay  Packers, New York Giants, and New York Jets don't have any  either.
Some of them are just creepy or really poor quality.
Some of them are pretty awesome. Bolt Man of the San diego Chargers looks like Jack Nicholson. Look it up.
Alright hang on.....Oh my goodness it really does look like Jack Nicholson!
The creepiest one to me is Jaxson De Ville. He looks like Chester cheetahs' pedophilic nephew.
Ewwww that's just gross!
Well it is what it is.
i wonder how much money the mascots make?
They average around 25k and some as much as 65k a year.
Holy cow I had no idea.
Denver Nuggets mascot Rocky is supposedly one of the highest paid NFL mascots.
I guess the difference in pay is due to how well the team is doing.
Yeah that would be my guess.
Interesting  things about the other side of the NFL.
The sad part is the mascots get paid more than the cheerleaders.
Once again women getting screwed.
