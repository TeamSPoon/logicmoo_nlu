What's your favorite movie that has to do with Irish mobsters?
I think I'd have to say, "The Town".
Wow, that was an awesome movie! Ben Affleck was great in it.
Yeah, he was! You know what other movie I really like him in?
Which one is that? There are so many that I can't even guess.
I know! But I was going to say, "Good Will Hunting".
That's a great one, too. Have you seen his sort of new movie, "Gone Girl"?
I haven't seen it yet, what is it about?
A man's wife disappears and he ends up being the prime suspect.
Oh my gosh! That is so scary, and I can see how that can easily happen
I know, it's definitely an awesome drama, and a good thriller as well.
I'll have to check it out next time I'm streaming! What other movies of his do you like?
I really liked "Argo", but it was really intense.
I haven't seen that one yet. Who else stars in it?
Alan Arkin is in it, and so is John Goodman.
Wow, I love movies that John Goodman is in. I have a feeling I would really like it.
So do I. It's about a CIA agent going on this huge adventure to rescue people.
I love films like that! I'm going to check that out as soon as possible.
It aired originally in 2012, but I am sure you can find it on a streaming service.
For sure! I can't wait to watch!
