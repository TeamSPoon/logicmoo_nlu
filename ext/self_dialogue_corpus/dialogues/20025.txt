Do you like Ariana Grande?
She's good. I don't have any of her albums though.
You should check out her album "Dangerous Woman" it's really good.
I will have to check that out.

Who do you like to listen to?
I like Citizen Cope.
I don't know much about him.
He's like a mix of blues, soul, folk and rock.
Oh! I will have to listen to him.
His voice is great. Almost has a Jamaican flare.

I like Sarah McLachlan.
Oh yeah, she's talented.
I love her voice, it can go so low and so high.
Her song "Possession" is great. "Into the fire" is too.
