I read an obituary last August about Kenny Baker, who played R2D2 in the Star War movies and had passed away. He seemed like he had a good life.
He must have been really small to get into that R2D2 machine!
He was, he was about three foot eight inches tall. He was sick for a long time at the end, but his family said he had a long successful life.
How many Star Wars movies was he in?
Three of the regular Star Wars, and 3 of the prequels.
Everybody loved R2D2. He was so cute.
His family said he was well loved by people all over the world. He was also in other movies like Flash Gordon, The Elephant Man, and Time Bandits. He started out as a club performer and did summer shows and charity events. So he had a long storied career.
That's alway nice when people can look back and not have any regrets, because they got out there and lived, and did whatever they had to do to chase their dream.
His character as R2D2 will be entertaining people who watch Star Wars reruns for many many years.
I'm glad he had such a busy, good life.
