Have you heard a artist called debiotator?
No I havent who is that?
He is this beat maker from nyc
Really how is his music?
Its great you should check him out his music is amazing
Ok ill do that as soon as I get home
By the way he also makes music with a other beat maker called biollante
Really?
Yea they work a lot of the time together making music
They sound cool
Yea they make music as cool as there name sounds
Thats cool. How you hear about them
I found out about them one day on youtube. And man I got hooked on them
The same thing happens to me all the time when I am on youtube
I like biollante more then debiotator
Why whats the difference between them
Biollante can compose music and debiotator just flips samples
Oh cool so you get the best of both worlds
Yea hopefully you enjoy them
I will and Ill let you know what I think about them after I check them out.
