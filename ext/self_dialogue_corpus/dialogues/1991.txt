Hello, what's your favorite team?
I like the Browns, how about you?
Oh man, I'm a Steelers fan! Do you think the Browns will be any better this year?
I think so, I have a feeling Jabrill Peppers will be real good.
Browns defense is looking better, how about the Steelers offense though?
Leveon Bell is the best RB in the league, do you agree?
I think it is between him and David Johnson.
David Johnson is definitely second best in my opinion. What about best WR?
I would have to say Julio Jones and then Antonio Brown.
Come on man, AB is definitely #1!
As a Browns fan I can't admit that!
Haha too much pride, huh? Who is going to the SB this year?
I think the Patriots and Seahawks!
That would be an awesome rematch, I hate the patriots though!
Have to respect their skill, though. Super talented team.
That is very true, they always knock the Steelers out so I hate them!
Haha well I hate the Steelers so we can call it even!
Maybe the Browns won't lose by 20 to the Steelers this year pal.
Very funny! This is the Browns year!
We will see about that!
