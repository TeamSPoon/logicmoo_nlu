Have you ever seen Gone Baby Gone?
I caught it on TV once, but just part of it
I saw it in theater; I thought it was really good. I didn't guess the twist but you might, haha.
I probably would.
I liked it 'cause I didn't live here in Boston at the time and I missed home.
I understand. It's interesting how many movies I've seen filmed here.
In the movie ... this girl, this young girl, goes missing. At first, the cops think her mother did something to her ... but she didn't.
Tell me more.
I'm not going to spoil it. You *have* to watch it with me.
I knew you'd say that. Have you seen Mystic River? That one I actually saw in the theater.
Yes! Didn't get to see that in the theater, though.
Well, maybe we should watch that one tonight.
That's about another missing girl, right?
No, it's about a dead girl, actually.
Oh.
A murder mystery along with a lot of personal mysteries among the people trying to figure it out.
Sounds good.
Have you read the book?
No, Gone Baby Gone I've read but not Mystic River.
I recommend it.
