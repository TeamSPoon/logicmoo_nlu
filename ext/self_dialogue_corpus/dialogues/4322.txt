Did you ever see the Stephen King movie Misery?
Only about a million times. I love Kathy Bates in everything she does.
She played an insane woman really well in that movie.
That's right. It wasn't overdone or ridiculous, but very believable.
That's right. Did you see her in Dolores Claiborne?
Yes that one was just as good in my opinion. She's such a good actress.
I think I might have done the same thing she did in that situation.
You mean her character in Misery?
No of course not! I mean Dolores Claiborne, for what her husband did to their daughter.
Oh of course. I'm sure a lot of mothers sympathized with her when that came out.
