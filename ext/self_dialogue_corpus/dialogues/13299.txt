Which of the robots from Star Wars is your favorite?
Hands down, my favorite is R2-D2.
Why is R2-D2 your favorite?
He is able to do so many different things. He is so adaptable and can help out in any situation
Do you think that he actually has a personality?
Of course. He is such an old droid.
What did you think about him appearing in the newest movies again?
It's pretty awesome. I hope they will expand a bit on this story line, as he is one of the most iconic characters from the old movies.
What did you think of the newest robot introduced, the BB-8?
He's not as memorable as the older robot versions, but he has some of the similar capabilities to R2-D2.
