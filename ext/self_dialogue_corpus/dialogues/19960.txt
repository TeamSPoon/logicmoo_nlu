What kind of music do you like?
I generally like to listen to everything, except lately I've really been into country.
I used to like country but it seems like the recent stuff sounds more like pop than country.
Yeah, sometimes some artists pair with pop starts and it kind of takes away from the country feel.
Who have you been listening to recently?
I really like Luke Bryan right now! Have you heard of him?
I'm not sure I have heard of him. What songs does he sing?
One of my favorites is from a few years ago, it's called 'rain is a good thing'.
Now that you mention it, I might have heard that one on the radio. Who is the artists that sings that song about growing up and being like their dad?
Oh, that sounds like the Zac Brown Band song, my old man.
Yeah, that's it!
You like Zac Brown Band?
I do. A few years ago they had a number of songs I really enjoyed.
You know I saw them in concert two years ago?
Really?! Were they as good in concert as they are on the radio?
Seriously, it was one of the best concerts I've ever been to.
That's awesome. I wonder if they have any upcoming concerts?
Actually, I think they do.
I'm going to look online and see if I can find any country music concerts later this summer.
Great, let me know if you find any!
