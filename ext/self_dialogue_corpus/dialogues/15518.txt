Have you listened to Adele's newest album.
I think so is that the one called 25
Yes that's it. What is your favorite song from the album?
That's a tough one some really good songs on that Album.
I think my favorite is Hello or When We were young.
Oh that's right those are both good. I also liked Send My Love
Yes that one is good too, really there isn't a bad song on the album
Ya I listened to that album a lot when it first came out.
Ya I just bought it recently so I've been listening to it all the way through.
Oh I will have to listen to it again.
I  really love Adele's voice. It is so soothing.
Yes it very pretty.
I actually saw Adele in concern one time a few years ago.
Oh wow I bet that was amazing.
It was it was right after 21 came out.
That would be something I would love to do.
Ya she even sang a couple of cover songs which was really cool
Oh really what did she sing?
She sang Lovesong which is by The Cure and To Make You Feel my Love.
Oh wow those are both great songs.
