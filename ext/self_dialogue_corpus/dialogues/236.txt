Have you seen Wonder Woman yet?
No not yet. It sounds pretty good though.
Yeah, it's topping the charts. Let's go.  I love superhero movies.
There sure are a lot of them these days.
I know.  Where was Spiderman and Thor when I grew up.
We did have Superman though and later Batman.
They did too many Batman's for me.
I really like the rebooted moody batman best.
Um, I'm more of a fan of Val Kilmer or Michael Keaton as Batman.
Those had good villains  too.  Like the old Penguin and Mr. Freeze.
