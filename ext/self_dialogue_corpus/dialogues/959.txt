So, which division is driven by the best quarterbacks?
In my opinion there's no debate in the No. 1 spot. NFC South's QB quartet is in a league of its own right now.
I agree! I'm a Ryan and Newton fan myself but what about Prescott and Manning? NFC East has a nice lineup as well.
Manning can't hold a candle to Brees though, he has more 5,000-yard seasons than every other quarterback in NFL history combined.
Eli Manning is Eli Manning. The two-time Super Bowl MVP is tough and clutch and still great.
But Brees, He's Canton bound ... yet still terrorizing defenses in his late 30s.
Ok what about AFC East?
That's easy Tom Brady of course!
For Sure! Man the Jets have the worst quarterback situation in the NFL right now!
Yea but on the flip side, Brady is the G.O.A.T.
You also have Taylor in that mix, I've always liked Taylor!
Yea and the Bills will function like an actual football team with a new head coach im thinking!
I'm excited to watch Taylor this year.
