What's your favorite electronic band?
I really like Depeche Mode, if you count them as electronic.
Yeah, they count! What's your favorite album of theirs?
Violator, hands down!
That's an amazing album. I grew up listening to that.
Have you seen or heard 101?
Yes! I have that album. I love it, it has all their best work from the 80s.
Yeah they were amazing live! I love watching Alan Wilder.
He was the best musician in the band, I think.
Me too. I feel like after he left they went downhill, although they had some good songs.
Have you heard their newest album, Spirit?
No, to be honest I havent followed them so much since Songs of Faith and Devotion.
That's a good album too, it's kind of intense.
Yeah it's a little too melodramatic for me, but there are some good tracks on it.
I love Dave's voice. Have you seen them live?
No, I wish I had when Alan was still in the band.
Do you like New Order?
Yes! I love them. I still remember listening to Republic in my room in middle school.
Yeah I remember when they got so big clubs were even playing them.
Yeah I actually like them better than Joy Division, to be honest.
