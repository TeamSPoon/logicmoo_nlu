So are you going to see the new Transformers movie?
Absolutely not, if I'm going to watch a thriller movie, it's got to be a good one.
I hear there's a new Godzilla movie coming out, how about that?
Maybe.  I don't like to waste time on bad movies. I like something like Inception.
True, that was a great film. Is it your favorite thriller?
One of them. I loved Dark Knight.  I would consider that my favorite thriller.
That was amazing. I do like when they can be funny too.
"The Usual Suspects" was like that.  What an terrific film.
You're right.  I like the twists in that. And Kevin Spacey is cool.
Let's go watch something now. I hear Hateful Eight is on Netflix.
