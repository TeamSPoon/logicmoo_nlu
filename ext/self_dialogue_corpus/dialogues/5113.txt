Who are the top Rookie of the Year candidates for this season?
Benintendi and I dunno.
You a Sox fan or is that just your guess?
Nah I'm a Rangers fan actually. Just think Benintendi is the front runner.
I like him, but wow, you're a Rangers fan and didn't say Gallo?
Does Gallo have eligibility? He's played small parts in three seasons.
Hmmm good point.
I just checked he had 133 ab the last 2 years and the cutoff is 130 so nah he's ineligible.
Oooh so close, that stinks.
Yeah. Even though I'm a Rangers fan and like the longball, he's not exactly doing much else at the plate either.
What about Swanson for the NL?
Yeah maybe, he's a popular pick but I can't call the National League. Thinking pitcher for some reason.
You're right there, I was thinking possibly Glasnow but no one is really head n shoulders.
Bell for the Pirates too...he's in the mix for NL ROY I'd think.
Maybe Renfroe and Margot for the Padres, but Petco might dampen their stats in comparison to others.
Those are two other good choices. NL has a lot of young talent this year.
It'll probably be some guys we've never even heard of that come up and get hot that win and we'll all be wrong lol.
LOl yea. Speaking of hot, what about Aaron Judge?
How could we forget that lol I think he's got a leg up on Benintendi at the moment.
Yeah I change my pick lol
