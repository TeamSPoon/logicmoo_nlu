So, have you seen any of the Batman movies?
You mean the Dark Knight Trilogy?
Well yeah, though I also meant any of them, like the Michael Keaton ones and such.
Oh! Then yeah, I've seen quite a few of them.
Do you have a favourite Batman?
Well, like you probably guessed from my original response, Christopher Nolan's is my favourite.
No love for the new Ben Affleck one, I take it.
I mean, I actually do like Affleck's portrayal, I just think the movie sucked.
What do you mean?
So, in Batman vs. Superman, I really like how the detective aspect of Batman is played up.
Yeah, that wasn't as obvious in the Nolan films.
Exactly. But I just felt like the conflict between Batman and Superman was too forced for me to take seriously.
That's fair, I guess, but I just love seeing detective Batman so much it's still my favourite.
We can excuse a lot of faults when the one thing we like best is right, I guess.
Okay, wise guy, why do you like the Nolan films?
I just think the social commentary and the cohesiveness of the storyline is so on point.
The Dark Knight really is in a league of its own, I'll give you that.
For sure! It completely rewrote the way we understood how a comic book movie could work.
Unfortunately, movie studios took that to mean that every movie should be dark and gritty.
Yeah. They misunderstood that Batman worked as dark and gritty because Batman himself is dark and gritty, not because all movies need to be.
