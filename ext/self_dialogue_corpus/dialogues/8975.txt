So, do you think Tool is actually working on a new album?
I'll believe it when I see it.
Well, supposedly the drummer and the bassist said they've been in the studio.
But Maynard denies it, but he's kind of a jerk anyways, so I don't think I believe him.
10,000 days came out....when? 2006?
Yeah. I think we're due for a new album. Its only been 11 years.
I'd like a new album from A Perfect Circle too.
Me too! I saw them on tour recently, and it was so good! Very atmospheric.
What's your favorite song of theirs?
I'd have to say "3 Libras"
