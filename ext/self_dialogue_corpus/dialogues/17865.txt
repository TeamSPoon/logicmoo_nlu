What is your favorite Michael Jackson song?
Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough.
So does that mean that you're more of a fan of his earlier stuff then?
Definitely, my favorite Michael Jackson music comes from his work through Bad.
While I love Jackson's earlier work, my favorite Michael Jackson song is probably Black or White.
That song was really good, but I wouldn't even put it in my top five.
Really? What would you list as your top five Michael Jackson songs then?
Aside from Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough, I'd have to say Billie Jean, Beat It, P.Y.T. (Pretty Young Thing), and The Way You Make Me Feel.
All great songs, although for someone who likes his earlier solo stuff, I'm surprised that you didn't pick Thriller.
I thought that Thriller was an amazing music video, but it's pretty mediocre as a single.
Fair point. As you can see from previous choice of Black or White, I tend to give weight to the strength of the music video in evaluating Michael Jackson singles.
I can tell. I just think that music videos should not be used to evaluate the quality of the song.
The thing is that especially with 1980s music, I tend to associate singles very closely with their videos. Remember, this was the time that MTV was starting.
I understand your point, but my favorite artists from the 1980s like Prince and Bruce Springsteen generally had pretty weak music videos.
They did have fairly mundane music videos, with the notable exception of Prince's Kiss.
Great video, annoying song.
Agreed. I am much more of a Purple Rain fan.
Me too! What's your favorite song from that album?
When Doves Cry.
Solid choice, although I prefer Let's Go Crazy.
