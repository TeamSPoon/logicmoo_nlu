The Beatles has always been my favorite group.
What makes you say that?
They were such a big part of my "growing up years".  I think they have really influenced the history of music.
I wonder if they will be remembered and revered as much as the like of Beethoven and Bach?
I think they will be with such diversity in their music.  You have everything from the lively "Twist and Shout" to the subtle, soft songs like "My Michelle" or "Blackbird".
Do you know how many songs Lennon and McCartney have written?
Has to be 100s.  I know they produced 13 studio albums.
Do you have a favorite album?
I really like their early albums, but I was too young to appreciate them then. I have always been fond of "Abbey Road".
"Come Together" is one of my favorite tracks from that album.
