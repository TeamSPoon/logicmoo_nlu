Hey, have you heard the latest regarding the Raider Fan fiasco?
Well, not really, what's going on with the Raider Fans
Apparently they're making the final touches for the new stadium, as you know?
Yeah. that I do know.
The new stadium faisco surrounds the horrifying fact that the new stadium will not be able to house all the fans.
That is quite a delemmna
Yeah, I know, to circumvent the problem the want to Shuttle Bus, in the fans, along with regarding others fan to park 3 miles from the stadium.
Wow, what were they thinking when they came up with that plan.
I'm not exactly sure, but I hope that it will not discourage people from attending the games.
Exactly! Which is why it should have been considered long before the last finishing touches to the new stadium.
I totally agree. The idea is to sell more tickets, and get more fans involved, not to discourage them in any way, from attending games.
Right. Nor would the want to be unnecessarily inconvenienced, due to the parking fiasco.
However, maybe somehow it's an upside to all of this.
I'd certainly hope so!
For one, I could think of is less of a frantic rush, when games are over, to make it to the parking lot first.
Right, like a mini stampeded of people trying to be the first out of the parking lot.
Right. It would eliminate and deter that aspect totally.
Resulting in less stampedes to get to their parked cars, and a lot less manic.
Precisely, they'll be a lot more activity surrounding who can make it to the Shuttle buses fast enough instead.
I get that. And a wish to not be on the very last bus that Shuttles them out of the ball park.
