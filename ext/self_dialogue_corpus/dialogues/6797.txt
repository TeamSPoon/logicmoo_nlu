I have the song Let it Go stuck in my head!
I love that song! Idina Menzel has such a beautiful voice.
I love the scene in the movie where Elsa sings the song. I like watching everything turn frozen.
I like the fact that Olaf is the same snowman from when Elsa and Anna were little kids.
The scene with Anna and Elsa when they were little makes me sad.
When Elsa accidentally hits Anna with ice?
Yes! It makes me so sad after their parents die and Elsa stays locked in her room.
I feel like their parents did a bad job though. They should have tried to teach Elsa to control her magic, rather than locking her up.
I don't think they did a bad job, they just wanted to protect Anna.
I don't think they should have locked Elsa away though. That's not fair.
