The Cubs are finally getting hot!
It's about time!
They are lucky that the other teams in the division were also struggling
Yeah. As of today, they are only 2 games out of first place
Exactly and they are playing the Brewers, so if they sweep them, they could be back in 1st place
Yeah, that would be great!
They have to much talent to continue to struggle.
I agree with you. This team is stacked.
Yeah it's time for the Cubs to dominate.
The hitting is really coming together
Yeah this offense should be dangerous
A lot of young studs in the lineup
Rizzo and Bryant alone are enough to scare anybody
I agree. Too much talent in this lineup
Over a 162 game season, the cream should rise to the top
Absolutely. They have plenty of time
Yeah, you just can't panic. Just gotta stay on the path.
The Cubs will be fine. They are the best team in baseball.
I agree, but watch those Yankees. They are back!
Yeah the Yankees are dangerous this year.
