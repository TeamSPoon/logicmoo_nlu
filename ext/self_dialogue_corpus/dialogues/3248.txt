So, is Psycho the first slasher movie?
Basically, yeah. There were other things in the next couple decades, but the next heir apparent was probably Halloween -- which, coincidentally, stars Janet Leigh's daughter.
Oh, yeah. Halloween.
Then, you know, Friday the 13th is a shameless rip-off. Mask-wearing unstoppable zombie man on a spooky-sounding day, hunting not babysitters but camp councilors.
Hey... that's... I hadn't thought of that before.
Yeah, then Wes Craven sorta did a satire in Nightmare on Elm Street... then again, a decade later, with Scream.
Those are satire? I mean, I guess Scream obviously is, but Nightmare?
The first one, sure -- though the later ones didn't quite get the joke, aside from Robert Englund being a huge pot of overcooked ham.
Now that you mention it, there was New Nightmare -- which... wasn't a satire, I guess, exactly, but it was... meta.
Exactly. That's pretty much all Wes Craven does... er, I mean did.
