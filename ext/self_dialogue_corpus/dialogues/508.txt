Did you watch last years Superbowl?
Yes I did. What a rollercoaster of game.
Probably the craziest Superbowl I have ever watched in my entire life.
Oh yeah def. a top 3 Superbowl of all time.
I still can't wrap my mind around how bad the Falcons choked.
Blew a 23-3 lead after halftime, yeah I would say they choked pretty bad.
I despise the Patroits but you have to give respect were respect is due.
Couldn't have said it better myself. I hate Tom Brady with a passion but that man is very talented.
Brady's not even that good of a quarterback, it's Bill Belichick who deserves most the credit.
I think Brady is decent but he's not as good as like Drew Brees when it comes to executing passes. But yeah Belichick is a mad man.
Drew Brees has had like 6 5,000 yard seasons, you can't compare the two.
I agree but it was oddly satisfying seeing the Falcons crumble and burn live on television.
I was about to turn off the game at halftime, I'm glad I didn't.
Ha c'mon man it's still the Superbowl. I was going to finish watching it regardless.
Did you see the end when the entire stadium started to boo Roger Goodell?
That was probably the highlight of the entire Superbowl.
I hate that guy with a burning passion.
Same here and I think every other NFL fan does too
Do you know what NFL stands for?
The "No Fun League"
