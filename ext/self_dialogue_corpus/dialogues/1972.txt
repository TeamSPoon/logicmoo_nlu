Isn't it insane to think that the Miami Dolphins went undefeated?
When did they do that?
In 1972.
Well, the Patriots did that in 2007.
Yeah but the Patriots lost the Super Bowl that year. The Dolphins won the Super Bowl.
So that has only happened once in the NFL?
Yeah. It is an amazing feat to think about.
Even if the Dolphins are the only team that has ever done that. They have only gone downhill ever since.
That's not true. We repeated and won the Super Bowl again the next year in 1973.
Yes but I mean that the last 30 plus years of Dolphins history has been pretty lousy since that streak.
We won the AFC in 1984.
Is that when you had Dan Marino?
Yeah. He was MVP that year.
Who beat them in the Super Bowl that year?
It was the Buffalo Bills. They didn't even deserve to be in the Super Bowl but they somehow beat the Dolphins.
Well what are they going to be like this year?
There is some hope for them this year. They made the playoffs last year and the new coach started to show some good signs.
Who is their new coach?
It is Adam Gase. He started last year.
Oh ok. Well hopefully they will make a comeback this year!
