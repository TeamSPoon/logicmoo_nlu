I am going on a road trip tomorrow. Can you recommend a CD or two I should listen to while I'm driving?
I am sure I can. Are you looking for a specific type of music?
I would like to hear something I am not familiar with, maybe something older.
I have the perfect thing. Have you heard of Jim Croce?
No, I can't say that I have.  What kind of music does he make?
I would call it American Folk with some rock mixed in.
That sounds really interesting.
You have probably heard at least one of his songs. I still hear "Time in a Bottle" on the radio every once in a while.
I think I may have heard that one but, I don't really remember.
That song is popular but, I have other reasons for liking him.
Really? Tell me a little about what you like.
He has a song that includes the lyrics "New York's not my home.  When I lived in New York for a couple of years, I listened to that song probably 5 times a day.
It sounds like a really sad song.
I guess you could call it sad. I would personally say it was not so much sad for me, it just had a lot of deep meaning.
I am anxious to hear it now but, I will save it for the trip.
Make sure you pay attention to "Lover's Cross" that one has a lot of meaning for me too.
Thank you so much, this guy sounds great. Is he still making albums?
No, unfortunately a plane crash took his life early on. He was young and had only made 5 albums.
That is terrible. I wonder why plane crashes take so many notable musicians.
I guess that is one of the mysteries of the world my friend.
