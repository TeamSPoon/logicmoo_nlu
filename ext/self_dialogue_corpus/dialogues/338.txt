Who is the better actress who plays Mystique?
Remind me who that is again?
The blue one who does martial arts and can transform.
Oh, right. Jennifer Lawrence and Rebecca Romaine-Stamos?
Yup, that's them. I like the latter.
Why?
She's far more vicious and believable as a villain.
Yeah, J-Law is more of a nice character, completely changed.
Well, it is a different time-line.
But as a fighter, Rebecca is far superior.
