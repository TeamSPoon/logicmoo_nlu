I started to watch Lord of the Rings last night. Ended up turning it off.
You didn't like it?
Well it was okay. It actually didn't hold my interest.
They were pretty good movies.
How many were there?
I think there were four or five.
Did you see them all?
No. I only saw Fellowship of the Ring and The Two Towers.
Did you actually like them?
They weren't bad. A good fantasy film.
Who was in them?
Elijah Wood and Liv Tyler. There were other good actors too.
Were they long movies?
Yes. Over two hours.
Don't know if I could sit through that.
They would catch your interest if you kept watching.
Armies of men and elves. That's different.
Yes, but there are some likeable characters.
Who's your favorite?
Bilbo.
