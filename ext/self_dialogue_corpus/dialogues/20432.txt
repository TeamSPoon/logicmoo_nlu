Have you ever watched He's Just Not That Into You?
Yes, I love that movie.
Who's your favorite character?
I really liked Beth.
I know. She was so sweet, and she just wanted to get married so bad.
It was so cute when Neil proposed to her by putting the ring in his pants pocket.
I know. That was the best part of the movie.
I also like when Mary and Conor finally meet eachother in person.
Me too. They were so awkward and cute on that first meeting.
I don't know how I feel about Alex and Gigi getting together though.
I know. Alex was such a jerk to Gigi.
Right? My mom thinks she should have slammed the door in his face at the end.
That would have been satisfying but of course them getting together at the end is viewed more positively.
I'm happy Janine got her own place.
Me too. Her husband was such a jerk.
I can't believe Anna actually thought Ben was going to leave Janine for her.
I know. He didn't even have the courage to break it off his wife.
Seriously. I can't believe Neil was friends with him.
I can't either. Neil was such a good guy.
I wonder why he was so against marriage in the beginning of the movie.
