How about them Kings? Really got fleeced by the sixers?
How so? What happened?
Well, they traded Stauskas, picks, and pick swaps for nothing and It didn't work.
True, they needed to clear space for free agents and they got none anyway.
Yea, and now they have the 5th pick instead of the 3rd because of it.
Wow, that could be a big difference.
Yea, and they also lose a few pick.
Yea, that will probably be a valuable one too. They always suck.
Has Stauskas amounted to anything?
Yea, hes a good player.
Interesting. That sounds like a win for the Sixers.
Hinkie does it again.  The guy is good.
Talk to me when the Sixers start winning.
Listen, just trust the process.
Oh, the process, huh? I'm trusting
Good! Theres a lot of good things going on in Philly.
I know. They will start winning eventually.
Maybe, but only if they can stay healthy.
Yea, thats still to be determined.
It sure is, but only time will tell I g uess.
