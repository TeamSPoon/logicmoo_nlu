Hey what's your opinion on J Crew's new spring catalog?
Well, I did see a few things I liked, but I haven't shopped at J Crew for awhile now.
Oh really?  Where have you been buying all your clothes lately?
Mainly from John Varvatos and Barneys.
Wow.  I love both of those places, but they are always so expensive.
I defintely agree, but the clothes aren't too much more expensive than J Crews and I never shop at there main stores.
Where do you get their clothes then?
There is a outlet for both stores at Sawgrass Mills.  Great way to save money and the selection is usually great.
I will definitely have to check both out.
You should.  I've actually saved a considerable amount of money compared to retail J Crew.
Do you only shop at the oulets for these clothes?
No.  I actually look on eBay quite often as well.
I never even considered using eBay for buying clothes.  How is the selection?
The selection is great, and the price is nearly half of that in store.
Yah, but what about the condition of the clothes?  I'm looking to look good and fashionable.
There are ways to search for only new clothes on eBay, and trust me you will look good in Varvatos clothes.
Thank you for the heads up.  I think I will look tonight.  I'm trying to impress my new girlfriend.
No problem at all and let me know if you need any help.  Your girlfriend will probably want to marry you after you become more fashionable.
I would hope so.  I look like a bum now.
Yes you do, but not for long!
