Did you see New Edition Sunday night?
No, where were they?
They were on the BET Awards show.
Really, did they sing Candygirl.
Oh yes! They tore it up.
Did Bobby show up?
Surprisingly yes, but he had a tough time dancing.
What do you mean?
He was slow and out of step quite a few times.
Man that Bobby is a mess.
He is but he threw done on the mic.
How many of their old songs did they dance to?
About four. They killed it when they sang "kool it now".
What? Can't believe I missed that.
Well don't worry they will show it again soon.
That's right they do rerun those shows huh?
Yes, I think it will be on Saturday.
I'm going to set my DVR so I won't forget, Thanks.
They start their tour in August. We should go check them out.
For sure! Just let me know the dates.
