Are we going to go see Despicable Me 3?
I think it looks pretty good, I'll go see it if you want to. What's this one about?
I read that Gru meets up with his long lost twin for one last criminal heist.
Is he still with the girl from the last movie?
Yes, him and Lucy are still married and they still have all 3 girls.
I love Lucy's character! She's so funny, smart  and strong!
Which of the little girls is your favorite?
I like Margo a lot, she is so protective of her little sisters .
True. I wish my older sister was like that!
At least you have a sister! I have no one.
