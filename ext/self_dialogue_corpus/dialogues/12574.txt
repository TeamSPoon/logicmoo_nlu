You know who I didn't expect to see in Revenge of the Sith?  Chewy.
Yeah I didn't know Wookies lived that long.
Yeah, I hear they live a very long time.
I felt so bad for Chewy when Han died.
I know, that was almost the saddest thing I've seen in a movie.
It almost sent me into tears.  Him and Han are the best bromance of all time.
Yeah they are.  You know a franchise is good when you have feelings for the characters.
Yeah, and it's not like we can understand Chewy.
Shows how good that acting is.
And the acting around him.  He's a great character.
