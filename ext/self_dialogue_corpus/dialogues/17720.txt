Do you still listen to Project 86?
Sure do!
I got one of their albums if you want it. I mean if you don't already.
Which one?
Knives to the Future.
Oh, no I don't have it, but I'd love to take it off your hands.
No problem. Have you ever read Andrew Schwab's poetry?
The lead singer? No I haven't but I want to.
He's a very talented guy, not just musically it turns out.
Well I know he's talented musically. I love what he does with his voice and the texture of his voice itself.
The texture?
Yeah, it's slightly scratchy, but thick and he always sounds like he's singing around something in his mouth.
That's a way to describe it.
I really like it. Do you have a favourite P86 song?
I like spy hunter. It was the first P86 song I remember hearing.
It's a classic. I like Pipe Dreams myself.
That's one of their mellower songs.
I like it because it has a great rhythm, it sounds so dark and dreamlike.
It's definitely dark if you listen to what's being said in the lyrics.
Yeah, "and outside my window the demons are singing" is about as dark as it gets.
