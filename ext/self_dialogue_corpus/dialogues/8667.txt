How do you feel about classic rock?
I love classic rock. My favorite band from that era is probably Fleetwood Mac.
Isn't Stevie Nicks the greatest?
Yes she is and her voice is amazing. She's a real witch you know?
Really? I always thought she had that witchy vibe about her.
She came out in an episode of American Horror Show: Coven
I would have loved to see that. My favorite Fleetwood Mac song is Silver Spring.
Oh you could really feel her pain towards the end of that song.
It's like she was fighting with demons. You could tell she'd been through a lot.
Yes, she is and always will be one of the greatest female rockers ever.
