what foreign band is your favorite?
I think the Cardigans.
I know there music but where are they from?
They are from sweden.
I did not know that.
Yep they had some success there before making it big internationally.
I recall them being huge in the mid 90's.
The album life was out in 1995.
I don't know it.
Well I am sure you know the song lovefool.
I do, but wasn't that from a different album?
Yes true, it was on the album  First Band on the Moon .
That one I think I recall my sister having.
It also had a song called Choke that I liked.
That was  a good track to.
She had such a unique sound and voice.
It slightly reminded me of ace of base.
I don't think so, but popular around the same time.
Maybe it is more the same ra connection than truly sounding a like.
I think so, because I don't think the vocals sound similar at all.
