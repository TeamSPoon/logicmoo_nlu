What was the most impactful animated movie in your life?
Honestly, it was probably Lilo and Stitch.
That's an answer I didn't expect.
I just loved the friendship they shared. I also loved the way they designed Stitch.
I'll agree Stitch was a great character idea.
Between his design and his voice, he's instantly unique.
His voice was really cute. One of my friends can recreate it perfectly.
Yeah, and he had a bunch of super abilities.
Oh yeah. Wasn't he super strong?
Yes, and fast. I thought it was a good break from the princesses at Disney.
