What do you think about Rap music?
I like it okay.
What do you like about it?
The beat is the best part.
What do you think about the bad language rappers use?
I can do without all that.
I wonder why most rappers feel the have to curse?
I think its because most people relate to it.
Oh I can relate to it but that doesn't mean I want to hear it put to music.
Me either I look for the artists that don't feel they have to take the approach.
