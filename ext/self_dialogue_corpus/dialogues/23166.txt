I love anything with Emilio Estevez in it!
I like him as well, he is a very talented actor.
He sure is! I loved him ever since I watched that movie Wisdom.

Yea, I believe it came out in 1986. I was still in grade school!
That also had Demi Moore in it, right?
Yep! I thought it was a very intense movie.

I loved the Stakeout and Another Stakeout.

Richard Dreyfuss and Rosie O'Donnell also star in it.
That is right, yea those were awesome movies.
I also enjoy all the Mighty Duck movies that he made.
