Have you ever seen a movie that was shot entirely in first person?
No, I have never even heard of that.
Wow, really? You should check some out.
Do you have any good ones in mind?
Well I saw one called Hardcore Henry.
What is it about?
Its about a guy who wakes up with robotic limbs being attached to him.
Then what happens?
Basically someone tries to kill him, then he finds a guy who wants to save him.
Wow sounds like its pretty intense.
It is, he ends up becoming really powerful and there are some really awesome fight scenes.
Interesting, I'll have to check it out.
It's funny because if you like video games you'll really like watching the movie.
Makes sense, because its in first person.
It feels like a call of duty game with really high graphics.
What makes you say that?
Well, just the scenes with gunfights look super realistic, but still have a video game vibe.
That sounds so cool.
It really is, you should check it out.
I'll definitely watch it sometime soon.
