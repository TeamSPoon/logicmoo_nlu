Do you remember the first time you saw the Beatles on Ed Sullivan?
Yes, All those screaming girls, you couldn't hear them sing!
She Loves You was the first song I heard and loved.  My mother said they sounded like they were in pain!
My parents actually liked them. They though their music was very catchy.
Remember that crazy time when everyone thought Paul was dead?
I used to play their record backwards and listen for the secret message.
They were great poets and storytellers.  Some of the songs didn't make sense to me specially on the Sgt Pepper album.
I just sang along to the songs.  I didn't try to figure them out.
Paul was my favorite Beatle.  He was so handsome.  I watched the movie Magical Mystery tour so many times.
The Fool on the Hill was a great song but I Am the Walrus was really strange.
