One of my favorite Al Pacino movies is Frankie and Johnny.
I've always liked him.  Is it a comedy or drama?
I'd call it comedy/drama.
That's actually my favorite sort of film.
Yeah, it's set in New York, too.  I love films set there.
I do, too.  New York's a good backdrop for anything.
The actress in it is Michelle Pffeifer.
Is she good in it?
She's very good, actually.  The made her look less glamorous than she usually looks.
Does she and Pacino have good chemistry?
They do have chemistry.  Their characters flirt a lot in the movie.
Is it primarily a love story?
Yes, it's definitely romantic.
Is it too sappy?
I wouldn't say so, but some might parts a bit corny.
A little of that is okay as long as it doesn't overwhelm me.
It's got a good balance of romance and comedy.
That sounds right up my alley, and I do like both leads.
They are the main reasons to watch it I think.
I'm going to seek it out.  I'm sure I'll enjoy it.
