We wanted to go to the movies but there isn't much in.
Go see The Great Wall if it's playing.
Which is that one?
With Matt Damon.
Is that the one where he's in China and fights along side them.
Yes. He's a mercenary.
Did you see it?
Yes, it was very good.
Was there a lot of killing and fighting in the war.
Oh yes. You'll enjoy it.
