Did you hear they're coming out with a new Mary Poppins movie?
Another remake? Disney is on a rampage.
This one looks good though, at least from the little bit they've shown.
The original is so good, though. Why redo it?
I don't know but as I understand it, it's not a remake but a sequel.
Kind of hard considering Julie Andrews is a lot older now.
Well, the character is still young so they cast Emily Blunt in the title role.
Oh wow, she's really great in musicals. I didn't care for "Into the Woods" but I liked her.
I did, too. Plus I like her in other things. I think she'll do great. I heard Julie Andrews approves of her in the role.
Well, if Julie Andrews has given her seal of approval then it's worth a look.
You'll like this then: Dick Van Dyke has a role.
Oh wow! Then I'll definitely go see it. The same character?
Sort of. He's not the chimney sweep, but he's the old banker's son.
Oh yeah, he did play the old banker. I forgot about that.
Angela Lansbury is in it, too.
Wow, that's already a pretty impressive cast.
Colin Firth and Meryl Streep also have big roles.
Okay, I'm convinced. When does it come out?
Next year, in December.
That's a long wait, but I'm sure it'll be worth it.
