Hey Martin, what are you doing?
Oh, hey Doc, I'm about to plug my guitar into this giant amp!
I wouldn't do that If I were you, there's a short in that one.  You should try this smaller one instead!
Oh, thanks for the warning.  You know, this reminds me of the movie Back to the Future!
Right, at the begining of the movie Marty gets blown into some boxes by a bad amp.
Right, I love that movie!
Me too.  Did you know that someone else was going to play Marty, but he didn't work out?
Wow, I couldn't imagine anyone but Michael J Fox as Marty.
I know, right?  You can see some of the scenes shot with the other guy on YouTube.
Cool, what else do you know about Back to the Future?
Let me think, well Huey Lewis, the singer makes a cameo?
Really?  I didn't know that!  Didn't he do some songs for the movie too?
He sure did, Power of Love and Back in time are both featured in the movie!
Cool, I love those songs.
Same here.  Huey was nominated for an Academy Award for his music.
Awesome!  What other facts do you know?
Well, there are a lot of subtle jokes in the movie, like Star Wars and Star Trek references.
Interesting, do you enjoy the sequels as well?
I do, they aren't as good as the original, but they are still decent movies.
I agree.  We should have a Back to the Future marathon soon!
