What kind of movies do you like to watch?
I love comedies.  I also love documentaries.
Documentaries?  Really?
Yeah, there are so many interesting stories to tell!  And now I have Netflix so I can watch a bunch of them.
Documentaries always seem boring.
There are plenty of good ones.  I really liked 13th.
What was that about?
It's about how the 13th amendment allows prisons to use prisoners as slave labor.
Well, I don't think that's a bad thing!
Ha ha.  Well, you should watch this.  It goes into how this targets black men.
Oh yeah?
Modern-day slavery, basically.
I don't know if I'd go that far...
Well, give this a look and see.
I'll look if I have time.
It's worth it.  It was directed by the same director who did Selma.
I haven't seen that either.
Funny enough, neither have I.
What??
I'm waiting for it to come to Netflix.
