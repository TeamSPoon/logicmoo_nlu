Will a Deion Sanders kind of player ever show up again?
What do you mean?
A guy who plays baseball and football
Oh, no not at all.
What makes you say that?
I think that there is too much money involved now.
So baseball pays more.
Right so they cant spend time on both sports
Or are the athletes just not as good?
No they are definitely good. Maybe even better
That runs counter to what you just said.
Yeah but think about how much training is needed nowadays.
I dont follow your logic nor do I agree with it right now.
Players have to focus on their main sport.
Do you think baseball has written it into their contracts?
Theres always that too.
So players are limited to what they can do?
I dont see how its bad to be honest it keeps them safe.
Thats true do you think a player would ever bargain it into their deal?
They could but I dont see it happening and time soon
