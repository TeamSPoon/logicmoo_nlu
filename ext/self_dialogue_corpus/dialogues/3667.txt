What good thrillers have you seen recently?
I liked the new Jason Bourne movie.
I love that franchise. The special effects and chase scenes are fantastic.
I think Matt Damon did a really good job in it.
Do you have a favorite thriller of all time?
The Usual Suspects would top my list for sure.
I loved that movie. I was very surprised at the ending.
I also loved the Sixth Sense.
That's another movie that had me fooled until the very end.
Yes, I loved that twist as well. He's done a few other fantastic movies with surprise endings.
