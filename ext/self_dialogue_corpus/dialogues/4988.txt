Have you seen Ken Burns' documentary about baseball?
Yes
I was surprised that Double day didn't actually invent it.
I was also. The thorough research impressed me.
Do you agree that the '27 Yankees are one of the best teams?
I wonder how they would do against the 2016 Cubs.
We'll never know. A lot of interesting detail about significant events in the evolution of baseball.
Yep. I learned about the Negro leagues and the women league, Curt flood's situation leading to free agency. A lot of stuff
I am thinking of buying it. A basball fan's dream.
What do you think overall of management's treatment of players.
For a long time, players were treated as a commodity, but that was wrong; the players did the actual work that fans paid to watch.
I agree. The owners have their rights, of course, but show dignity for the players.
I learned about A.J. Rawlings starting his company; now a well-known name in baseball.
Sure is. I enjoyed learning about baseball during World War 2. The palyers who fought and those who didn't make it back home.
Just like the country, baseball started out east and work its way west during its expansion., which seems to still be in progress.
The Cuban players sure have made their impact It's great that baseball integrated them.
Yep - the ol American melting pot
I liked learned about the stadiums of yesteryear, like Ebbets Filed and such
I also liked learning about the Dodgers team name origin.
Yeah, the Trolley Dodgers at first because fans had to watch out for traffics going to the stadium.
