I remember the first time I saw Star Wars. It blew my mind!
Me, too. I thought the light saber fight was great.
I think my favorite in the franchise is the Empire Strikes Back.
Yea, that is good, but I liked Return of the Jedi best.
It is not all great, though. Remember Jar Jar Binks?
Oh, what a terrible character! What were they thinking?
My favorite character is Han Solo. Ford did a great job.
Yeah, I liked Han, but I really liked Yoda. That little guy could be tough.
It was amazing what they could do with puppets!
Even when the puppets were goofy looking aliens, they still were entertaining.
