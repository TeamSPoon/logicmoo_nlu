Have you seen any good movies lately?
I really liked the latest Fast and Furious movie.
Yeah, I heard it was really good.  I can't believe they've been able to make so many of those movies!
I know, it's so sad about Paul Walker though.
Yeah, I know.  I liked him a lot.
Me too.  I thought they would be done making them after he died but I guess not.
Yeah, I like the way they ended the final movie with him.
It was very touching.
Do you like action movies?
I do, the more intense the better.  What about you?
Yeah, me too.  I like older stuff though.
Oh yeah, like what?
I like a lot of the older Bond movies.
Me too, which actor do you like best as Bond?
I like Pierce Brosnan, I'm not really a fan of Sean Connery.
Really?  I like Sean Connery a lot as Bond.
What about Daniel Craig?
Yeah, I like him as Bond too.
Yeah he's pretty good.  I wonder who they will get to play him next.
I don't know, I heard it might be Tom Hardy.
