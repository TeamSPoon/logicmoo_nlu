What did you think of "Revenge of The Jedi"?
I don't know, I was soured once mark Hamill "made a hamburger of his face".
Huh? What do you mean?
Hamill was in a car accident in California, and had to have plastic surgery to get his face back together. After that, he seemed to have a lisp.
Really??? I never knew that.
I noticed, but he was really great playing Luke to Jim Henson's Yoda. I also like the fun in Jabba The Hut's hideaway.
I liked the battle between Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker. How could you not?
Yes, you're right. It's so exciting!
I can't wait for the new film. It's supposed to have lots more of Luke in it.
Yes! It's supposed to be called "The Last Jedi", and  I can't wait!
