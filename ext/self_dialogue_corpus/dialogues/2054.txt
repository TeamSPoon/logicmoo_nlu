What's the next nfl season look like?
Not sure ... what happened in the off season
Some of the free agents are not yet signed
Like who?
Colin Kaepernick, for one.  That would be a big loss.
Whoa!  That's right!
What about the Patriots?
They are looking good
Brady coming back?
Yes, that's a definite.
How old is he now?
Can you believe he will turn 40 next month?
No way!
Yep, on August third
Reminds me of George Blanda
Who?
Blanda.  Played until he was 48
Really?
Yea, but he was a kicker ... easier on the body
for sure.
