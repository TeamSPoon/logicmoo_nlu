have you heard the remix for black and yellow?
which "black and yellow" wiz khalifa or Damian?
Wiz
no, never even knew it has a remix out already.
man you have to listen to it,he had like the whole hiphop head on it.
like who?
snoop dogg, drake,2chains,french motana,lil wayne and t-pain on the hook.
oh my days that's like a bunch
they all delivered and the remix was slayed.
damn i need to hear this one,would purchase asap on apple music like now.lol
you should man, you love rap music and a crazy 2chains fan so you'll dig it.
of course i am so eager to listen because of 2 chains
oh i did forget to put ricky ross on the list,he took the last rap.
what tha! Ricky on it too.
oh yeah he had this line that says " now i am getting salute from rappers i respected".
hahaha seems he's throwing shade at someone.
i wouldn't see it that way, i probably feel he meant he's getting respect from other rappers he has respect for as well.
sounded like a diss to me though lol
man this is how fans create beef that wasn't there at the first place.
hahaha that was just my thought.
