Are you looking forward to seeing Rough Night?
I don't know.  What do you think?
I think it looks funnier than Bridesmaids.
I agree that Bridesmaids was disappointing.
I don't know about Scarlett Johanson being funny but the plot looks good.
I think she can pull it off.
I hope it's like another Hangover.
Hangover 1, that it, not 2 or 3.
Hangover 2 was just dark.
And 3 was boring.
