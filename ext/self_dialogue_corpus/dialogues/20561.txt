What was the best comedy to come out in the 90s?
Saturday Night Live had a strangehold on them.
Yeah its a tough question
You could say the Chris Farley ones were the best
Or the Adam Sandler ones.
More people I think connect with the Sandler ones.
Tommy Boy though was great
As was Black Sheep.
I think that Billy Madison may have been the best ever out of the decade.
I think you are too narrow minded about the SNL movies.
Why do you say that?
Because there were other comedies that came out.
Yeah but these were the best ones of the era
OK so can you answer my original question?
I would say Happy Gilmore.
OK I can see where you are coming from.
I just think the storyline was great.
They did it was Carl Weathers!
I wouldnt say he carried the movie
No me neither but it was funny to see how his character came to be missing a hand!
