Have you see Get Out?
Not yet -- that's the one by Jordan Peele, right?
Yeah, it's really good. Creepy.
I saw Keanu. Did you see that?
Yes, that was hilarious. I cant believe they made a movie about that.
Haha, it was a pretty ridiculous premise for a movie.
I finally watched Sleepwalk with Me, the one that won the Sundance Audience award.
Oh, I heard about that. It's with the stand-up comedian, right?
Yeah, Mike Birbiglia. It was good, but I like comedies with stand-up comedians in them in general.
Oh, like Half Baked?
Yes! That's a classic. Dave Chappelle was perfect in that.
Yeah, has he been in any other movies?
I think he was in Undercover Brother.
Oh yeah, I saw that. It was ok. Denise Richards was good in it.
Not as good as she was in Wild Things!
I never saw that, but I heard about it. You seen the new Transformers yet?
No, I heard it was awful though. And Megan Fox isn't in it.
Yeah, it was kind of a bummer of a movie. I'm going to see Wonder Woman next week.
Cool, I think I'm going to see Megan Leavey, because I love dogs and used to train them to do scent work.
Oh, I heard that Megan Leavey was really good. My friend said she cried when she watched it.
