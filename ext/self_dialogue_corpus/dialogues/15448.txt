I need your help.
What's up?
I'm trying to figure out what the best cover song is.
What do you mean?
Well, there's a lot of cover songs out there, some of them are great, but some of them suck.
I think there's more that suck than not, but what are your thoughts on it?
Well, I agree that a lot suck, but sometimes the new artist completely takes over the song and makes it their own.
Alright, I see what you're getting at.
Like Hurt, for example.  Nine Inch Nails' version is awesome, but I think I prefer Johnny Cash's version.
Didn't Trent Reznor even say he liked Johnny Cash versions better too?
Yeah I think so.  It's so good.
Do you have any other examples?
Well, I think the greatest cover song is Respect by Aretha Franklin.
That was a cover?
Yeah! I found out a few weeks ago. Otis Redding sang it first.
Man I never knew that.
Yeah, even Otis Redding said it's her song now.
That must've meant a lot to her.
I'm sure it did, I doubt half of the people in the world know it's a cover.  You should look into more of them.
I sure didn't.  I'll definitely look into more of them.
