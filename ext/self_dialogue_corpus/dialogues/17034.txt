Were you a One Direction fan back in the day?
Actually, I never was, but I do really like Harry Style's new solo album!
Me too! That's why I asked you.
This is a totally different sound than boy band mania.
It feels much more substantial--like he actually has something to say.
It sort of has this dreamy 80s pop/rock vibe.
I never would have listened to this album and thought, "that's Harry Styles"!
What's your favorite song of the bunch?
I personally really like, "Ever Since New York." It's also got that dreamy quality to it. And you?
"Sweet Creature is my favorite."
Do you think he ruined his reputation by being associated with One Direction?
I don't know! I would see this CD much differently if it were from an indie musician.
I would have listened this in high school, thinking it was some cool alternative band.
Parts feel like the Arctic Monkeys.
I was thinking that too on the track, "Kiwi"!
British screaming rock music all sounds like the Arctic Monkeys!
You're right about that. They made a genre.
Do you think one day when Harry Styles is a real rock star, One Direction will make a nostalgic comeback?
Hanson Brothers level? Let's wait for Harry Styles to make a solo career first.
The spawn of boyband teenage music.
