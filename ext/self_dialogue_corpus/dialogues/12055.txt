What did you think about rogue one?
I thought it wasn't bad, better than force awakens.
I thought the same.
Who was your favorite character?
I liked the blind asian monk guy.
Oh yeah, his belief in the force was crazy.
I know right? He just blindly walked into laser fire.
Haha, but his buddy covered his back.
Yeah that's true. But what was their backstory?
It wasn't really mentioned.
