Remember Nappy Headed Roots?
Yeah they were a flash in the pan
I wonder if they still make music
Theres alot of one and done artists
That could be said for any genre.
Rap has them more than others.
Like Petey Pablo?
Joe Budden had one hit but hes big still
Yeah he does the podcast stuff
Not very credible for a street rapper
