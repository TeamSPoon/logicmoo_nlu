Who do you think is the worst team in the league?
Browns. The Cleveland Browns
The Jets are right up there with them in being awful.
You mean being down there. There is no up with the Browns nor the Jets.
Haha! Ain't that the truth
The Jets have no QB, the browns have no QB.
It is hard to judge which team is worse at this point.
Browns have Osweiler
They only traded for him because the Texans gave them a pick to take his contract.
Yeah that was a dumb move by the Texans to pay him that much.
Osweiler should of stayed with the Broncos. Everyone knew Peyton Manning was leaving.
It was about the money and the Broncos shorted him in offers.
I would of rather took less money then go play for the Texans.
Well he was rewarded by being traded to one of the worst teams, if not the worst.
I can't remember the last time the Browns were good.
I think it was in the 1990's when the Patriots current coach was their head coach.
Didn't the team get sold when he was the Browns coach?
I think so, tough luck because the Ravens who the Browns became have won two superbowls
Yeah tough luck for Browns fans. Not sure how many there really are.
I think I knew one Browns fan, maybe.
