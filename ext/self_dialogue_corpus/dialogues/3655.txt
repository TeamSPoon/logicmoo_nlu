Have you ever seen the movie "The Shining"?
Oh that old movie that is set in a hotel with Jack Nicholson?
Yes, that one.  It's so strange but really good and scary.
I always think of the scene with the bloody twins standing at the end of the hallway every time I'm in a hotel with a long hallway.
Oh yeah, and the scene with the blood coming out of the elevators!
Yes!  That movie was great.  There are a lot of conspiracy theories about that movie you know...
I know.  Have you seen the movie "Room 237" that was made about all the conspiracy theories?
I have heard of it but I haven't seen it.
It's great.  I saw it on Netflix and it explains a lot of strange things that are in the movie.
Oh wow.  I'll have to check that out for sure.
