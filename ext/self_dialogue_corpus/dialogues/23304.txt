You know what the most unlikely romantic movie in the world is?
No, what?
Ronin. That is the most unappreciated romantic movie of all time.
What? I don't even recall there being a romance in Ronin.
There really never was, which made it a sad romantic movie, but a romantic movie none the less.
Please explain.
Robert De Niro's character, Sam, and Dierdre, they get dressed up and go out to do some surveillance....
I've never found surveillance to be romantic.
Then maybe you aren't doing it right. They pose as man and wife, and there's this awkwardness at pretending to be a couple.
I remember.
And then they're in the car doing surveillance, and another car passes and they kiss to seem like there's nothing suspicious about them sitting there in this parked car.
Oh yeah, I remember. Then things really get hot.
Yes, but that's it. It never gets to develop into anything more.
Yeah, they're pulled apart shortly after that.
And then he sees her at the ice skating rink. And she asks him to just leave with her, leave everything behind. And he admits to her that he's a secret agent, he's been undercover this whole time...
I remember that now.
You can see by the look on his face there's nothing he'd rather do than get in the car with her, but he knows they'd never get away. And so he does the one thing he can do: he saves her from getting caught.
And she looks up at him, and she looks just devastated.
Yep. Then she drives off without a word.
And in the end, even Vincent knew there was something there, because he reminds him that she would never come back to the place where they met.
