Who is your favorite classical music composer?
Are we talking classical as in "art" music or specifically 1750-1825, give or take?
You're such a snob, let's do specifically the classical era.
My favorite is Beethoven.
Why? That's so clich√©.
It's really not, he's a transitional master.
Transitional? What do you mean?
He 'bridged the gap' between the Classical and Romantic eras.
How so? Or are you just repeating what you heard in your classes?
His orchestration, text setting, harmonies, and so forth, and combining voice and orchestra are all foreshadowing those who come after.
Combining voice and orchestra? That's called opera.
No, silly. It's not.
Okay, enlighten me.
Well, opera is a very specific genre, and Beethoven DID write those.
So what did he do?
Well, he took a choir and soloists and put them in front of a symphony.
So? Didn't others do this?
Yes, but not to this extent. He featured voices DURING his Ninth Symphony.
Ooh, I get it.
No, you don't. But thanks.
