What is your favorite Lady Gaga video?
I like POKER FACE.
Her long straight hair looks cool.
And she wears those gloves.
And has a big diamond ring.
I like the dogs in the video.
You don't see dogs much in videos.
She dances cool.
And makes that funny poker face move around her face.
That song is a classic.
