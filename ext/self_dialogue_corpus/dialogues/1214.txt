What are your thoughts about the NFC East this year?
Hard to tell. I would assume that the Cowboys are still the best team in that division.
I agree. Their offense is still one of the top ones in the league.
They did lose some players on defense and that will definitely hurt.
Their defense has been their downfall over the past few years.
It seems to let them down at the wrong times. I could see them going either 12 and 4 or 11 and 5 despite the defense losses.
Sounds about right. What about the other three teams?
That's a difficult assessment. The Redskins, Giants and Eagles didn't seem to make a huge splash in the offseason and they were all mediocre last year.
Mediocre is right. They are basically eight and eight teams.
Eight and eight, but if one of the teams get hot, they could end up ten and six.
Which of those teams is more likely to get hot?
I don't know, probably the Giants. They still have Odell Beckham and he can win a game or two just by himself.
Giants always seem to be in the mix.
Yes they do. The Eagles and Redskins are pretty much feast or famine. Playoffs one year and out of playoffs the next.
This will probably be a year where both teams are out this year.
I could agree. I guess my final prediction is Cowboys 12 and 4, Giants 9 and 7, Eagles 7 and 9, Redskins 6 and 10.
I could see that. I will go with Cowboys at 12 and 4 and Giants at 8 and 8. Eagles and Redskins both at 6 and 10.
Not too far off of my prediction.
Not at all. I would be surprised if anyone besides the Cowboys won the division.
Same here.
