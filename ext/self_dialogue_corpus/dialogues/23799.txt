Who was Daniel Radcliffe in again?
Come on you should know this!
I don't know. It's on the tip of my tongue.
I'll give you some hints.
Okay.
He goes to a school.
Hmm. I don't know.
He has a scar on his forehead.
Oh! He's Harry Potter. Duh! How did I not know that.
Yeah you dumb dumb. Disgracing the Wizard name.
I'm such a muggle.
I love Harry potter.
I do too.
Hey have you seen the new harry potter movies?
Fantastic beasts and where to find them?
Yeah! Did you like it?
I watched it. I didn't like it as much as harry potter, but it was a pretty good movie
Yeah it was fun. A little too crazy
Right. A huge tornado blowing up a town. Old Harry potter never did anything like that.
True!
