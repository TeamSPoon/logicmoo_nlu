Have you ever seen Inglorious Bastards?
Yes, one of the best Terintino movies out there.
That was awesome.  Brad Pitt cracked me up the whole time.
Yeah, we're here to do one thing.  Kill Nazis.  Haha.
I liked that part about the Bear Jew.  He comes up with the bat.
Yeah, that whole movie was one joke after another.  And good action.
And the big bad, the German Guy he's a great actor.
Yeah he was.  He knew all those languages.
One of the funniest parts of the movie was when Brad Pitt was speaking Italian.
I know, with that awful American accent.
That was classic.  Then those other two guys went through and started shooting everyone.
You know what else was great?  That last scene.
Yes, that was one of the best parts.
My favorite line "You'll be shot for this"
"No, probably chewed out.  I've been chewed out before."
That was awesome.  How about the part where the German guy was so obsessed with the milk.
That was pretty good too.  And when he wanted the cream for his dessert.
That was good.  When the big bad has this odd normalcy to him that makes him extra creepy.
I know, he was extra creepy.
Of course he was a Nazis, and Nazis are always creepy.
