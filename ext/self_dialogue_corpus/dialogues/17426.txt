If you were going to recommend one British rapper, who'd it be?
Tough question. Everyone is going big for Stormzy right now but the underground is where it's at.
Too many of these rappers go big and lose their authenticity right?
Bang on. Have a listen to Mic Righteous, Dreamland is a great album.
I hear good things about English Frank too.
Yeah, I heard he's retired now but you can still find his stuff online.
So take me back to Mic Righteous and what makes him real.
Well, he's the son of a drug addict immigrant Dad and a mother who abandoned the family.
I guess that comes out in his lyrics.
Too right. His brother became a boxing champion too and there's a bit of envy in there as well.
So is it aspirational? Angry?
A bit of both. He's got the self-awareness but also the anger of all the best rappers.
And the beats?
Always great. A lot of it is produced by Preston Play.
I need to give it a listen don't I. Recommend me some tracks.
Any of his Fire in the Booth videos are a good starting point, and from there just follow the links.
Anything I can read that'll tell me more of his story?
It's all in the lyrics. Check out his 3rd Degree video, the track Gone as well.
I'll be rapping myself before you know, by this time next year it'll be me that'll blow!
Yeah right, I don't believe that. Listen man, your bars are whack!
