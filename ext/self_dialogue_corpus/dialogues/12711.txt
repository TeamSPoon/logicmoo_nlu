Are you interested in Star Wars at all?
Any true American has at least seen Star Wars, and I am a true American.
Have you seen all of the movies?
Yes, but I like the older ones the best.
Which one is your favorite?
I like The Empire Strikes Back.
I love that one too.  i especially love Yoda.
Yoda is awesome!
Yea.  He is so wise and knows how to help Luke become a Jedi.  I think there are life lessons in the Star Wars movies.
I know what you mean.
