Do you think any teams that didn't make the playoffs will this year?
I think some teams have improved enough.
Which teams do you think are better.
I think the chargers will be better.
Really? The chargers?
They were 1-8 in games decided by a touchdown or less.
If they win even half of those games they're in the hunt.
Plus they started out 1-4.
It's always tough battling back from a bad start.
You're always seeming to try to climb out of a hole.
Philip Rivers is a good quarterback.
I agree with you.
Things have got to turn his way eventually.
He's overdue for some good luck.
The team bolstered the line in front of him for this year.
Two of their three top picks for the offensive line.
Forrest lamp and Dan feeney could wind up starting.
Yes they could.
Russell Okung from Denver might not be as bad as he looked with the broncos.
He provides depth.
