Do you want to watch Wreck It Ralph tonight?
Yes! I was actually thinking about it the other day.
Yea? What about?
Oh how much I loved fix it Felix.
Yea Jack McBrayer was perfect for that role.
Oh I couldn't imagine anyone else playing him.
I loved how he had a crush on the girl Sargent.
Oh that was rediculous, I laughed really hard at the singing taffy too.
Yea me too. I really loved King Candy too. He was just rediculous even though he was so evil.
Yea I loved the twist with him at the end too. That was really unexpected.
