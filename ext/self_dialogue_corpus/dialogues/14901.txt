Would you call The Help a comedy?
Well it is really funny.
Yeah but it has just as much drama as it does comedy.
Then call it both.
But if you had to pick one
No rule says we have to.  Minnie is hilarious.  She steals every scene she's in.
She is definitely the star of the movie.
Oh yeah, especially the pie scene and her scenes Celia.
She's also really funny in Bad Santa
Yeah but she doesn't have many scenes.
