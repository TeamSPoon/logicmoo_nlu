Have you heard about the latest rumor for episode 9?
Is this is about the crazy fan theory concerning Darth Sidious and Supreme Leader Snoke?
No, this is an even crazier rumor!
Oh really? Please, do tell!
The newest crazy theory is that Supreme Leader Snoke is actually Ezra from the Star Wars Rebels series.
Ezra? Isn't he pre-episode 4 and a good Jedi in training?
Well, the rumor goes that Ezra loses everyone by Empire and gets trapped in the Unknown Regions while being pursued by Thrawn. He gets corrupted by the dark side and becomes Snoke.
That's a pretty crazy theory. Do you have anything to back it up?
Nothing solid, just rumors on social media.
That's too bad. It's a pretty crazy idea to have Ezra turn dark and become Snoke.
