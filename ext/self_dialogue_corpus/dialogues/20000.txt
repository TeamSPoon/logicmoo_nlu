Did you know that a new Tool album is going to be released soon?
I think I heard something about that. Tool is great.
Yes they are.
Do you know what other bands sound like them?
Well, if you like Tool, you should probably try listening to A Perfect Circle.
I think I've heard them. They have the same lead vocalist as Tool, right?
Yes: Maynard James Keenan.
He's a good vocalist. How would you compare A Perfect Circle to Tool?
Their sound is not quite as loud and heavy as Tool, but I think the rhythm and melodies are almost identical in character.
What about the drummer? Tool has a great drummer also.
The drummer for A Perfect Circle sounds pretty similar in style. At times you might think you're listening to Tool.
I'll have to give them a try. What other bands sound like Tool?
There is another band that sounds a lot like them. They're called Soen.
Are they good?
They're okay. They seem like they're trying to be a Tool clone, but the songs are still pretty good.
That's interesting. I've never heard of it, so I'm guessing it's kind of obscure.
I don't think many people have heard of Soen. Another group that Tool fans like is Porcupine Tree.
I've heard of them. I would say they're similar to Radio Head.
The vocalist is similar to Radio Head's. The instrumentals, in my opinion, can get more similar to heavy metal at times than Radio Head.
That's true.
