Hey! I must say I have new found respect for Justin Beiber!
You dont say!
Yeah he has been really doing good things around the world.
Beiber.. thats the Canadian guy right, the one that always behaves badly?!
Yeah but I feel he has turned a new corner
What do you mean?
He did that concert to support what went on in Manchester, and he also did a concert to support flood victims in Peru.
Wow I didnt know that
Plus I love his new song!
Which one.. love yourself?
NO NO!! Get with the times man! He is on the new Luis Fonsi track Dispacito!
What? Justin Beiber knows spanish?! HAHA
Yeah! Man he is really happening right now!
I've got to listen to this! I'm gonna try on youtube right now!
Yeah but its not like you think.. he is really good!
Yeah?
The song is number one on the charts right now!
