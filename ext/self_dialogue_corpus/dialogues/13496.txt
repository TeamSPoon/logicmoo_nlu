What's your favorite Stars Wars movie?
I like Episode IV the most
What's that one called again?
A New Hope
Oh yeah, that one was awesome.
Yeah it was really popular when it came out
People like the movie's effects so much!
Yeah like the light sabers, those were high tech graphics then!
Now it seems cheesy, even Vader's voice seems funny to some
But that's how it goes, I still like the movie's actors and effects anyway!
