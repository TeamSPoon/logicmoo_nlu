What is your favorite movie of all time?
The Wizard of Oz.
Wow, that's going way back.
Yes, but it's such a great movie.
What do you like about it.
I like the whole theme of home is where the heart is.
Okay, I guess it was quite innovative back in the day.
Yes, it was. Especially with the black and white and color transition.
Yes, and the witch flying through the air.
Oh right, I also liked all of the different characters she Dorothy met on the yellow brick road
First there was the scarecrow, without a brain
And then a tin man without a heart
And then the Lion that lacked courage.
Yes, they made quite the team.
Didn't the wizard end up being a total scam?
Yes, he was the man behind the curtain.
That's right and then he floated out of Oz on a balloon.
And left Dorothy all by herself
Until she tapped her shoes
And she finally made it back to Kansas
