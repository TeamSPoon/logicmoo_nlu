I wonder if we'll ever get 3D releases of the other Star Wars movies.
There are 3D releases for some of them?
Only Episode I. Supposedly they had episodes II finished, and possibly III but they never released them.
Just as well, I'm more interested in 4K releases anyway.
Not that it matters in the case of Episode II.
Why not?
Well, the movie was filmed in 1080p, so a 4K release would only be upscaling it.
The older ones are fine though, because they were made on film, right?
Yeah, but some of the CGI on the Special Editions was probably made at a lower resolution before being put back on film.
I guess I don't care that much as long as it looks nice.
