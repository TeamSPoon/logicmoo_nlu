What would you say is your all time favorite Thriller movie?
While I don't watch too many thrillers, one that comes to mind was Disturbia.
I have not seen that one.  Would you recommend it?
I absolutely would.  It was a 2007 movie starring Shia LeBeouf and Carrie-Anne Moss.
What was it about?
It was about a teen who finds out he lives next door to a killer, but no one believes him at first until it's too late.
That sounds pretty intense.  I know who Shia is but I don't know who Carrie-Anne Moss is.
She was the actress who played Trinity in 'The Matrix.'
Oh I see.  I do know her then.
She is a phenomenal actress.  You should definitely give Disturbia a shot.
