What movie are you most looking forward to?
Spider man homecoming, for sure!
I cannot wait for that. Iron man AND spider man.
I know! Have you seen the trailer?!
Of course. I'm not too big on who they chose for Spider man, though.
I don't mind the guy. No one can beat the original, though.
For sure. I hope its better than the last one.
The last Spidey move was good, but not great.
I agree. But with Tony Stark in this, there's no way it'll be bad
I sure hope so. Tony is hilarious.
I wonder if any of the other avengers will be in it?
I don't think there will be. I saw the cast list and its just Tony.
Thats a bummer. Not even a cameo?
Not from what I read. Only cameo is Stan Lee, but thats in every movie.
His cameos are amazing.
I know! I think hes been in every Marvel movie.
Only other bummer is that mary jane is out?
What? She's a main character.
Not in this one!
Ok, I don't know how I feel about that
