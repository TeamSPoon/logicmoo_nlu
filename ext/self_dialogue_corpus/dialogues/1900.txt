I can't believe training camp is a month away.
Yeah it'll be great, i can't wait to see college kids compete.
How about Mitch Trubisky?
Who? I never saw none of him...
He started a few games for north carolina last year.
Oh yeah didn't the Bears give away a huge haul for him?
It'll be worth it if he turns into Andrew Luck.
I'm thinking he'll be more of a Ryan Leaf
You really think the Bears are going to be that bad?
What else do they have? Certainly not a functional offense or defense.
At least they are not the Cleveland Browns...
That's true, they were really hard to watch last year.
I really like that they embraced analytics though.
What do you mean?
They have a gm from baseball who is all about getting the most bang for your buck.
Are we supposed to trust the process?
Essentially yes, but this has never been tried in football.
What have they been doing?
Well they compile draft picks and plan on be bad next year.
That's gonna happen anyway.
