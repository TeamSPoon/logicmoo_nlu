hey did you watch the nba finals?
yes, that was on crazy game!
I know I am so glad lebron was able to get another championship ring
Im not really a cavaliers fan, my favorite team is the knicks!
the knicks suck! I don't know why you are still a die hard fan
I know but I have to stay loyal, I know Carmello will bring us a win next year!
Maybe, if he stopped hogging the ball and be a team player then you guys could win
I think they just need to pick better players during the drafts, instead of these international players no one has heard of
I suppose, but lebron will always be my favorite player no matter what team he is on
He is a real good player, helping Ohio get their first championship!
Although, I still wish that he was on the Heats
Yea the Heats did have a triple threat with Wade, Lebron, and Bosh
Yea, those were the best games that I have been to
Were you at the game when they went into double overtime
no, but that was during the final championship everyone thought the game was over, but it kept going into overtime
that was one crazy game!
I wonder if lebron is going to make Cavilers is permanent home
He should, they will definitely burn his jersey if he leaves them again
knicks need to burn carmello jersey just because!
that is not nice at all
