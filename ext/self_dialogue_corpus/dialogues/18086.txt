Oh man, I miss the DC Talk of the old days.
Yeah. They couldn't stay together forever though.
I know they needed to do their own thing, but I feel like all of their solo ventures combined weren't any better than DC Talk as a whole.
Tobymac was pretty successful solo though.
Yeah, I know he's popular, but I feel like the quality of songwriting went down.
Who was your favourite voice from DC Talk?
I really like Michael's voice, I thought he was most diverse in what he could do with it.
Really? I like Kevin's voice, his was so unique compared to the other 2.
Unique, yeah, I just think there's a very limited style of songs that work with his voice.
That's true. Maybe that's why he didn't have as much success going solo as the other guys.
Yeah, I mean, Tobymac had his whole solo thing, Michael Tait has Newsboys now, but Kevin just sort of fell off the radar.
I hear he's singing lead for Audio Adrenaline now.
That's good, he needs something.
And Audio Adrenaline lost their lead singer due to that odd voice condition.
I remember that. Still miss that guy.
What's your favourite dc talk song?
That's tough. Jesus Freak is a classic, but  I also like the mellow sound of My Will.
Those are both good. I always liked Mind's Eye.
I used to have that on a mixed cd. I think I just listened to it so many times I got tired of it.
That happened for me with "Luv is a Verb".
