Do you think there will be another Fast and the Furious movie?
I just watched the current one and it really seems like there is opportunity for another one.
How did you like it?
It was pretty good. I didn't think it would be but it was full of great actors.
I really love Jason Statham. He was supposed to be a bad guy but I kind of cried when I thought he died.
That was horrible. I thought Dom had turned to the bad side and Jason Statham was becoming a good guy.
I thought it was so cute the way Jason Statham rescued Dom's baby.
That baby was adorable. He was right on cue with whatever was said.
Yeah, and then Letty was so accepting of the baby.
I can't wait to see what happens in the next movie if they make another one.
