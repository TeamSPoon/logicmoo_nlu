Did you ever see Coming to America?
Was that a newer movie?
No, it was from the eighties.
Who was in it?
Eddie Murphy.  He was a prince.
Oh, yeah.  He was foreign royalty or something.
Yeah, and he needed to come to America to prove something or anyother.
Yeah, I don't remember why he came to America.
It was a pretty good movie though.
Yeah, most of his movies back then were pretty good.
Didn't he get a job at a McDonald's knockoff?
Yeah, he had to get a working man's job or something.  I think the name of the place was McRonald's.
That's where he met the girl.
Yeah, it was the owner's daughter.
I really thought the Soul Glo ads were funny.
Yeah, they were funny then, but thirty years later they still are.
Didn't he have an assistant?
Who?  Eddie Murphy's character?
Yeah.  Another guy came along with him.
Oh, yeah.  I think it was Arsenio Hall.
