I love the Shining. It's my favorite horror movie.
I know a lot of people love it and talk about it being deep, but I don't get it.
It's all in the details. You have to watch what isn't happening, all the stuff that surrounds the action.
And what happens when you do?
You start realizing there are impossibilities. Windows that are on an internal wall. Character seamlessly going from one level of the hotel to the other, as if it was all one level.
Keep going, I'm listening.
You realize the external shots of the building can't possibly align with the interior shots, Nothing is what it seems.
So why isn't it just bad film making?
Because it's intentional. Even if you don't notice it at first, you start to feel uneasy because things don't add up. You start wondering what is real and what is a product of madness.
Okay, it's sounding better.
Chairs disappear in the middle of a scene. The typewriter changes into a different typewriter in the middle of the scene. A character goes into the storeroom and comes out a door that couldn't possibly connect to the storeroom.
I never noticed this stuff.
Once you start watching, it's everywhere. The boy has stickers on his door and in the middle of the scene a sticker vanishes. But it's symbolic.
How so?
The sticker that disappears is Dopey, from the 7 Dwarfs. And it's at the moment the little boy starts having these visions about the hotel. He's no longer innocent, or dopey.
Why does he talk with his finger?
When he's scared, this other personality, or maybe even other power, takes over for him, so he doesn't have to deal with it. And he doesn't remember when he's in this state.
I just thought he was being a weird little kid.
Exactly. Then you start to realize that he isn't just a weird little kid.
So what does all this have to do with the moon landing being faked?
