Let's talk music. Who's your favorite female singer?
I have a favorite singer for every genre. You have to be more specific.
I understand. I'm the same way too. I can't name a favorite song.
Exactly. I have a favorite song for every emotion. They can't compete.
So true. I need mood music. I have a favorite for every occasion.
Yes. I think it's too difficult to ask someone to choose. Well what is it?
I guess I mean favorite songwriter/singer? Is that easier?
So much easier. Thank you. Fiona Apple is my favorite.
Oh my God yes. I love her. She's awesome.
I know. It hurts how often she releases albums.
They just released a vinyl copy of her "Tidal" album. I guess I know what to get you for Christmas.
Really? I'm so excited. I don't know if I can wait for Christmas.
What do you think is your favorite album from her? You don't have much to choose from.
I know. That's a hard choice buddy. Let me think about this.
Sure. She's a master. Thank God she only has four to choose from.
Believe me it doesn't make it easier. Each one is so good.
Well I'll give you some time. There's "Tidal", "When the Pawn...", "Extraordinary Machine", and "The Idler Wheel...". Pick one.
Too hard. They're all masterpieces. They take long to come out because she puts her all in it.
Anyone would have to give her that. She's a genius.
She is a genius. I can't make up my mind. I think I'd have to go with "Tidal" only because that was the start of the love affair.
