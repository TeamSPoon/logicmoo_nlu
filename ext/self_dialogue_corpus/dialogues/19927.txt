Who is your favorite alternative band?
I'm not sure. I have a few that I like, but I don't listen to a lot of alternative bands.
Who are some that you like?
I like the Black Keys and Arctic Monkeys.
I like the Artic Monkeys too. Arabella is one of my favorite songs.
I've not heard that one. I like Do I Wanna Know.
Have you ever listened to Muse?
I think so. What do they sing?
They sing Uprising, Time is Running Out, and Starlight.
Oh yeah, I do like them.
I'm going to see them in concert this year.
Nice. I just remembered I've been listening to the Silversun Pickups.
That song they sing, Substitution reminds me of a 90s band.
Oh yeah? Which one?
Garbage. I think you should check out their music.
Garbage? Not sure about that name.
Yeah, I know. That's why I didn't say they sounded like Garbage.
Okay, so what are some of their songs?
My favorite is I'm Only Happy When It Rains. Their first album is called Garbage.
Okay, I'll check them out.
