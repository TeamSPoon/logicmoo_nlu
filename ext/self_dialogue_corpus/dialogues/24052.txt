What did you think of The Martian?
It was a great survival story
It looked like they were really on Mars
Matt Damon was funny in it
It was a little ridiculous that they went back to get him
It would be an expensive rescue mission
I think the dust storm would not have made them rush to take off
That was the main flaw in the story
He was pretty creative
It was hard to watch him eating the potatoes and getting low on them
I've eaten just one type of food. It is not fun after a while
I liked how he found out how to communicate with NASA
The space ship was a little massive
It was like the one in 2001: A Space Odyssey
It would have been hard to poke a hole in his suit to get to the right place
That would not have pushed him forward very much
I hope real life Mars missions go smoother
They would just leave him in real life
He would have died if they had not come back
He was having trouble toward the end
