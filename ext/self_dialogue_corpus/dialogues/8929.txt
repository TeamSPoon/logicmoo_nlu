Who would you say is the best rock band of all time?
Aerosmith!
Oh my they are so awesome.
Who is your favorite member?
Steven Tyler of course!
I know he is so hot!
No kidding!  Especially for an older guy.
I would love to be his wife so we could hit the high notes together.
I don't want to miss a thing is my favorite song by them.
Mine too it reminds me of the movie Armageddon which I loved.
