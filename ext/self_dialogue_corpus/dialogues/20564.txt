Well, it depends on the type
What do you mean
I typically like War Documentaries

Whats the best one?
The World War 2 documentary by BBC is the best film i've seen in general
What about life or health documentaries
There are a few that I like
Which ones in particular
I love Dear Zachary
What is that about
It's about a man writing a letter and making a video for a kid whos dad was killed by his mother
Wow, should I check it out
Yeah, but beware that it's very heart breaking
I'll keep that in mind
There is also one that I like called Bully
