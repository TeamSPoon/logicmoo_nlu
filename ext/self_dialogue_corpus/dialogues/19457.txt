My niece told me yesterday that she had heard this really cool new song on the radio.
Yeah? What song was it?
Livin' On A Prayer by Bon Jovi.
That is so funny, did you tell her the song wasn't new?
Yes I did, and she was shocked.
I bet she was.
I think what shocked her the most was when I started to sing the song.
That had to be funny.
It was, but I pulled out the album, Slippery When Wet and let her listen to some other songs from it.
That is a good album.
Yes there are a lot of good songs on that album.
What other songs are on that album?
You Give Love A Bad Name, Wanted Dead Or Alive, I'd Die For you, there are a lot of good ones on that album.
You should play some White Snake for her.
I should, they are another good band.
I like there song Here I Go Again.
Me too, that was the graduation song for our class.
That is so cool.
It is funny how kids hear a song for the first they assume it is new.
Yes, but I bet we were once like that.
