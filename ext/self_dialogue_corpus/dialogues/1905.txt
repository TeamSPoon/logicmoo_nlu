Who is your favorite Quarterback?
I like Aaron Rodgers a lot
Me too, he is probably the best in the league
I would have to agree with that, who is your favorite?
I really like Russel Wilson
Yeah he seems to be a good fit for the seahawks
I think you are right, they've found a lot of success with him over the years
I love watching him
He has a lot of good mobility
One of the fastest in the league no doubt.
I would say he's a top 5 QB in the league
Who are the others?
Rodgers, Brady, Prescott
What about the final QB?
I thinking about it...
What about Carson Wentz?
What? No way, the eagles are terrible
Well then who?
I would have to say probably Carson Palmer
Yeah, the Cardinals have been pretty good
