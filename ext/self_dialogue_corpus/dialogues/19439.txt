What is your favorite music genre?
I would probably say alternative.
Like what bands?
The Killers, I definitely love them.
Who are they?
They sing Sam's Town, Mr. Brightside, and some others.
Oh yeah, I know Mr. Brightside.  That's a great song.
Definitely.  Oh, I also really like Fall Out Boy.
I totally forgot about Fall Out Boy! I haven't listened to them since I was in middle school!
Well they have new music out.
Really?  When did that happen?
Well just in the past few years they released a couple albums, and I think they're coming out with another one soon.
I'll have to check that out, because I used to jam out to their music on my iPod when I rode the bus!
Wow, so much nostalgia and good memories! That's why I keep listening to them!
I think I may buy the new album then!
I probably will too, so if you want to borrow it feel free!
Thanks so much!
They may even be having a concert somewhere near here soon.
That would be so cool to go to, keep me posted, maybe we can go together.
Sounds awesome, I will definitely keep you in the loop. In the meantime, go listen to some Fall Out Boy, I know I will be!!
