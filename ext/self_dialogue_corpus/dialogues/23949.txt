I think every one should be forced to watch the Harry Potter films.
Why is that?
They really have the power to change the way people think about life.
For instance what?
Well, Harry over comes things.
He still stays fairly true to himself too.
I like that in the end, he forgives the Dursley's for all the things they did to him.
Do you think Dumbledoor was a good representation for the LGBQT community?
J.K Rolling went on to say he was meant to be.
Ian Mckellen was meant to be the next Dumbledoor when the first actor passed.
I think he would have down well.
But it would have been to close to the wizard he plays in the LOTR movies.
And the Hobbit movies.
Gandalf, Mckellen did that part so well.
That was a film with nearly perfect casting.
I thought even Orlando Bloom did so well as the elf.
You know, he and Fordo only speak directly to one another one time in the whole trilogy.
Wow, I had never even noticed.
I liked the way the friendships in that film developed.
They all had one goal, and in the end they achieved it.
