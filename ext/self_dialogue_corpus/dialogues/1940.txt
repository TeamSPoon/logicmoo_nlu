What is the worst franchise in the NFL?
A few years ago I would have said the Raiders, but it has to be the Jags..
Small market problems?
Yeah small problems and a college football state.
Well the Titans are in Tennessee and that's a college football state.
Yes it is, but in Florida you have The Gators, 'Noles and the 'Canes.
Yeah, you're right.
In Tennessee you just have the Volunteers and their program is far from its past prominence.
Did you like Tebow?
Well, he should have moved over to tight end.
I agree, have been saying that for years.
Yes, If you look at his skillset and physicality it's not prototypical NFL quarterback, it's Tight End.
So why didn't he?
That's a multi-million dollar question. I would say hubris.
Ok, what is the best franchise?
That's easy, the Patriots?
And the 2nd best?
Has to be the Steelers. They do damage in the playoffs basically every year.
The Broncos have really come up though.
Yes they have, but the Steelers have been up for a long time now and I doubt they will diminish anytime soon.
