I just rewatched Rogue One last night. It's still holding up on the small screen.
Really, I thought Rogue One was a bit boring and had pacing issues.
Boring? Pacing issues? Did we watch the same movie?
Look, it takes nearly an hour for Rogue One to establish the characters and the battle was over too fast.
That's what I love about Rogue One! It takes its time to introduce the characters to the audience.
Of whom I don't care about, and half of whom I still don't remember the names.
Then you are not paying attention to the movie. I can name all the main characters and side characters in that movie.
Well prove it then. Who is the blind dude that goes all kung-fu on the storm troopers?
His name is Chirwut-Imwe and he is a disciple of the Whills. He is played by the kungfu master/actor Donnie Yen.
Amazing. I bow before your encyclopedic knowledge of all things Star Wars.
