I didn't get a wink of sleep last night.
What happened?
The loser in the apartment above mine was blairing his radio all night.
Oh, no!
Yes.  And it gets worse.
It get's worse?
Why do have to repeat everything I say? Yes, it gets worse.
Ok. How?
They guy has a dog, too!
And?
The dog appears to be a music lover.
What do you mean?
Fido, or whatever you call the mutt, kept singning with the radio...all night long.
All night long...sorry.  It did?
Yes. And that is not the worst part.
Not the worst part? What was?
It's not bad enough the dog sang along to the music of Death Leopard, The Scorpions, and Marilyn Manson...
How can it be any worse?
The dog sang better than any of the original singers. I could stop listening!
Well, the bar was set pretty low. I would like to hear that dog sing opera!
