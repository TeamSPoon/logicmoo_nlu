The Seahawks may just be trending downwards.
Yea, they still have a great defense, but you could be right.
Do you have faith in Russell Wilson?
I do, but he isn't the kind of guy to lead a team alone.
Well nobody really is, but I know what you mean.
Yea, but I mean like a Flacco. Great quarterback, but you need a defense and playmakers.
I understand. Wilson still has a couple receivers and a tight end so he may still be good.
Yea, they will still compete, but I'm not sure they have enough.
Speaking of Flacco. How about the Ravens?
Eh, they added Maclin this year, but I think they have more holes than that.
Yea, I agree. They probably can't top the Steelers.
Yea, the Steelers are still contenders, aren't they?
They sure are and they have a great time again.
Yea, well if Leveon Bell can get his act together and stop getting suspended.
Yea, I hope he can get himself straightened out. He is too good of a running back.
Yea, especially when he is on the field.
Yea, with Roethlisberger, him, and Brown, they should be a force.
Yea, I agree. Thats a great trio!
Yea, it is. Just always question Big Ben's health.
Yea, he does seem to be prone to injury sometimes.
