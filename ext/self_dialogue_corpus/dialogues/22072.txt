Have you seen any good movies lately?
I saw mean girls for the first time.
You are joking.
Not joking, I truly hadn't seen it.
That is simply amazing to me! How is that possible?
I was never really a movie person.
Well that is odd.
But I liked it though.
Did you?
Yeah I liked Lindsay Lohan's character.
I liked them all really.
I heard there is a sequel.
Oh yeah there is but it was bad.
Really?
Yeah sequels are never good usually.
That makes sense.
Anyways I really recommend you watch it again.
Why again?
So you can pick up on things you missed.
That makes sense. Well it was nice talking to you.
