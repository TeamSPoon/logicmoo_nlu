I think the Fox and the Hound is a great movie.
I agree with you. I like the old Disney cartoons way better than the newer ones.
The movie is so sad, but so nice at the same time.
Yeah, the way Copper and Todd are torn apart by Copper's owner is so sad. I cried!
I liked the song that the birds sang with the owl in that movie.
"Lack of Education!" Haha.
Do you know when that movie was made?
I'm not really sure. Probably back in the 1990s or something.
Yeah you're probably right.
I think Flubber came out around the same time.
