Hey! Are you ready for football to start up again?
I can't wait... espcially because I playing in a few fantasy football leauges this year!
I love fantasy football but I never seem to do very well in it.
It's part luck and part knowing who the elite players are.
It makes sense that the more knowledgable one is the better they will do
Yeah, if we're not in the same leauge I will help you make some choices as to what players to draft if you'd like?
That would probably be very helpful as I tend to always pick my favorite players but not necesarily the best players.
I follow a lot of teams pretty closely and always pick players based on their abilities... not whether I like them or not.
Speaking of players... who is your favorite player?
Mine is Drew Brees... what about yourself?
I am a big fan of Carson Wentz. I am excitied for what he can do for the Philadelphia Eagles this year.
I think he's an exciting player that could have a long career.
Yeah. I just don't think we will ever see someone as elite as Tom Brady has been ever again
I can't stand him because he is so skilled and I'm sick of him being so good!
Yeah, he's definitely overstayed his welcome. He should retire while he is a champion.
I agree, but I also wouldn't be surprised for them to have a chance at winning it all again this year.
I really just don't want the Patriots or the Cowboys to have any success this year.
I think it's going to be a bounce back year for a lot of teams that didn't fair to well last year.
I hope so. I'd like to see new teams emerge as contenders... that's always exciting to watch.
We'll wait and see... I just can't wait for football to be back!
