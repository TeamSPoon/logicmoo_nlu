I'm trying to put together a Halloween playlist and I was wondering if you had any ideas.
What do you have so far?
I have the theme from Ghostbusters, Witch Doctor, Monster Mash and Thriller.
How about This is Halloween?
Oh, from A nightmare Before Christmas.
Time Warp would be a fun one.
I totally forgot about that one. What else?
You might look into some Alice Cooper songs.
Which ones do you recommend?
I think Welcome to My Nightmare and I Love the Dead would be good choices.
I'll check them out.
Now, it's not exactly Halloween music, but the theme from The Exorcist is pretty creepy.
I could use that and also use the Freddy Krueger them song.
And you can't forget Purple People Eater.
That's a classic!
Do you think you have enough songs, yet?
I need just one more.
You could use the theme from The Addams Family.
Perfect. My list is complete.
Glad I could help.
