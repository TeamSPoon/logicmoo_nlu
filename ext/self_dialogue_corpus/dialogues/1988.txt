Did Tom Brady win the Heisman trophy last year?
I take it you don't watch football a lot.
Why do you say that? Isn't Tom Brady one of the best players in the NFL?
Yes, exactly. The Heisman isn't awarded in the NFL.
I'm pretty sure the Heismas is for football, isn't it?
It is, but for college football. NFL is the professional league.
What is the name of the trophy or prize that the best player in the NFL wins?
It's called the Associated Press Most Valuable Player award.
Who is the current holder?
Well you were right on the money about that part, because Tom Brady is the current MVP.
What other awards are there?
Well of course there's the Superbowl trophy. It's called the Vince Lombardi trophy.
Who is Vince Lombardi? Was he a great player?
He was actually a coach I believe. One of the best coaches in the league.
Nice. What about rings - do all the players get rings like they do in NBA?
Yes they do. The losing team as well.
Are any of these cash prizes?
No, I don't think cash is involved. Just the honor.
And of course they can probably negotiate their contracts for higher pay if they have received one of these awards.
I'm sure, it's very presitigious
