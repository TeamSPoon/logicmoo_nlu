Are you looking forward to this NFL season?
Yea, it should be a great season as always.
It is hard to wait for it, seems like forever.
It definitively is.
What is your favorite team to watch?
My favorite is the Bengals. What is yours?
I like the Rams.
Ah, They should be better this year.
Yea, I hope so.
Wonder if the Bengals will make it far this year.
They always have a good year but never in the postseason.
It is sad to watch.
Yes it is.
I think Dalton needs to move on.
I would like to see that.
I was happy with AJ playing for him.
We actually watched them play the ravens last year.
They lost that one didnt they?
They sure did.
Those poor Bengals.
