Have you ever heard any music by The Decemberists?
No.  At least I don't think so.
Oh, well, they are my favorite band!
What's their music like?
They're kind of a folk-influenced indie rock band.
A little like Fleet Foxes or Iron & Wine then?
Yes, sort of like that.  I'd be happy to loan you one of their albums.
Sure, that'd be great.  So, is it your favorite album then?
No, I think it's better to start with a different one of their albums than my favorite.
Really?  Why's that?
Because my favorite album of theirs- "The Hazards of Love"- is a rock opera.
Oh, well, I guess a rock opera isn't a very standard entry point into a band's catalogue.
If I buy a Decemberists album for someone I like, I've usually picked "The Crane Wife" since I feel like it's pretty solid and contains songs that show a pretty wide swath of what types of music they like to make.  ...But...
But what?  You're going to loan me a different album?
Well, the last time I gave "The Crane Wife" to a friend, he told me he didn't get it...  So, I've been thinking about whether "Castaways and Cutouts" might be a better entry point for someone new.
I see.  Well, I'm willing to listen to whichever album you want to give me.
I guess I should ask how you feel about really long songs or song sequences?
I don't have anything against them.
Of course, The Decemberists have some short and average-length songs, but they also have some really long songs or songs that go together in sets.
Well, being open to writings songs of different lengths probably opens things up for them creatively.  I'm happy to check them out.
