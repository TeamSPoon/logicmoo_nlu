Can you believe NFL training camps are about to start?
No! I'm so excited.  Football is my favorite sport to watch.
Living in Cleveland, football season is actually pretty brutal for me; the Browns are terrible.
It should be interesting to see how Myles Garrett, Jabrill Peppers and David Njoku impact the team.
I agree, but I am still very skeptical.
Who do you think are the teams to watch this year?
It's hard to imagine anyone being able to hold off the Patriots.
I agree - but Tom Brady can't have that many more great seasons in him.  He's 39!
I think the Giants could be a strong playoff contender.
Possibly, they do have a great defense.
Do you go to a lot of games?
Not really, the tickets are so expensive.
I also feel like they are so long - I prefer to watch on TV so I can get up and walk around a little bit.
Who is your favorite player to watch?
I love watching Cam Newton.
Yeah he's exciting.
Did you watch the draft?
I actually went to it.  It was insane.
Wow! That must of been great.
Seeing some big names get drafted will definitely stick in my memory for a long time.
