Hey! What is your favorite NFL team?
I like the Chicago Bears.
How long have you been a Bears fan?
My whole life. My entire family loves the Bears.
They haven't played good in a long time. That must be painful to watch.
Yea, it has been. What team are you a fan of?
I am a Lions fan. They also have been terrible for many years.
Yea, they have been even worse than the Bears.
They haven't won a Super Bowl since 1957.
Wow, that is a long time. I can't believe you are still a fan.
I still love them and support the team.
Do you go to games a lot?
I try to go to one game a year at least.
Me too. I love going to the Bears games. They are so much fun.
We should go to a game together.
We can try and find a game where the Bears are playing against the Lions!
Yes! That would be fun.
Hopefully my Bears beat your Lions!
Haha, we will see! I will look for tickets this week.
Sounds good!
