The Cavaliers are unbeatable.
I think the series with Golden State is gonna be great.
Don't be too quick to say that. The Spurs are not done yet.
Yeah, but Leonard is not gonna play game 4 either.
That is not good. Hopefully Golden State realizes that they beat an injured team.
I don't think it matters to them much.
Yeah, winning a title is all that matters to them.
Yeah, I heard Lowry wants to join a team where he will get a ring.
Yes, that is pretty disappointing.
He is like a person who marries another person for their money.
I'm a big Booker fan from the Suns.
Yeah, he wants to be on the Suns forever.
The finals will be good though.
Who do you think will win?
The Cavaliers.
I think Golden State will win.
Why?
Cause they have the top 2 players in the west.
Leonard is better than Durant and he doesn't swear at mascots.
Oh yeah, I saw Durant do that.
