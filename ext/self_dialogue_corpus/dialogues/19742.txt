What are you listening to?
Old stuff...the Beatles.
Beatles never gets old...which album?
Rubber soul. One of my favorites.
Is that the one with Norwegian woods?
Yup, the classic.
I can't believe the Beatles have been gone for ages and people still listen to them all the time.
Yeah, I hear their music used in movies and stuff all the time.
So sad, only two of them are still alive, though.
I wonder what more John Lennon would have done...
World is missing out, it feels like.
I love some of their later works though...
Like Abby Road and Let it be?
Yup and the White Album...
What is your favorite Beatles song?
That's a tough one...I used to like "I'll follow the Sun" but there are so many...you?
I don't know..."a day in life" maybe...
Or "If I fell"? That's a hard one to sing, though, with all that Key changes...
Or what about the whole side B of the Abby Road?
Haha...people won't know what side B is now a days...
