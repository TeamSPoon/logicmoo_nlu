What's your favorite genre of music?
I'd have to say R&B. It just has that groove I need.
I like r&b too. Who is your favorite singer or group?
Mary J. Blige is my favorite r&b singer. I like her and Lauryn Hill.
I love Lauryn Hill! I'm sure you've listened to The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill.
That's the album right there. I was obsessed with her when that came out.
She's just so unique and talented. She did a song with Mary on that album.
I Used to Love Him. That's one of my favorite songs on that album.
What other singers do you like?
I like Jaheim, Tyrese, LSG, New Edition, Raheem Devaughn...there are so many.
I love Faith Evans, Kelly Price, Donnell Jones, and Stevie Wonder.
Stevie Wonder is my favorite artist of all time, of all the genres.
What's your favorite song by him?
I'd have to say Overjoyed is my favorite.
I love Knocks Me Off My Feet. That's my favorite of his.
Donnell Jones did a remake of that song.
I know but I like the original much better.
Me too. Did you know Gangsta's Paradise sampled Pasttime Paradise by Stevie Wonder?
I didn't know that! I'll have to listen to that song.
I was so shocked when I first heard it. I thought I'd heard all of Stevie's songs.
