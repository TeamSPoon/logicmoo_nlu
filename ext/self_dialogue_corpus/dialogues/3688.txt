What's you favorite thriller movie?
Oh that's tough there are so many good ones, but I'd have to say Fracture.
Fracture, who's in that?
It stars Anthony Hopkins and Ryan Gosling.
I don't think I've seen that one, what's it about?
Anthony Hopkins shoots his wife and then messes with the attorney and gets off.
Is it scary?
No it's one of those movies that keeps your mind going and you are constantly trying to figure out what Anthony Hopkins is doing and why.
It sounds really good.
It really is he plays a bad guy and you know from Silence of the Lambs how good of a bad guy he can be.
