Do you know of any movies that Liam Neeson starred in?
I'm not sure I know who Liam Neeson is. Can you give me one movie he played in?
He played Oscar Schindler in the movie Schindler's List back in 1993.
Oh yeah! I know who you mean. Didn't he star in the movie Les Miserables too?
I'm not sure because I never saw the old one. Do you know of anything else he starred in?
Yes, he played in that movie called Nell opposite Jodie Foster.
That's right! I loved that movie!
I liked it too. He also played Qui-Gon Jinn in Star Wars Episode I.
I didn't remember that but I think you're right. There was also that one about a wolf.
I think that was called The Grey. Why did you want to know what he starred in?
I was trying to remember the name of a particular movie that he did a long time ago.
What was it about?
It was about an old castle whose owner was needing to generate some money so he claimed that it was haunted and sold tickets for people to come and visit.
That doesn't sound familiar. Can you tell me more about it?
It turned out that the castle really was haunted by a number of ghosts. One of them was Liam Neeson and another one was Daryl Hannah.
Was it a Horror movie?
No, it was a Comedy. I wish I could remember the name of it.
I don't think I saw it. I'm sorry.
Wait! I remember! It was called High Spirits.
That makes sense if it was a Comedy. I'll have to check it out.
