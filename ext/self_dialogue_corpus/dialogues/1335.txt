Do you think Atlanta will be good again?
I think they will.
I do too.
I'm not sure they'll be good enough to make it to the SUPERBOWL again.
Yea,I'm not sure either.
Matt Ryan is one of the best though.
Oh I agree with that.
It still takes a lot to get to the big game.
It takes some luck too.
Oh sure it does.
The ball has to bounce your way at times.
Yes it does.
Julio Jones is outstanding.
He could be the best in the game.
He's surely right up there.
Justin hardy can be good.
I like him as a returner.
Yea,he's a force.
Matt Bryant can still kick.
Yes he can.
