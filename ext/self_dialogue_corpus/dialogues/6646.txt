Well you know of my fear of Ursula from "The Little Mermaid" and Chernabog from "Fantasia." What was the creepiest thing you saw in a Disney movie?
I think that would have to be Cruella De Ville from "100 Dalmations."
Why Cruella? Sure she seems crazy but what about her?
Well she wanted to make clothes out of those puppies!
I think the fact that she wanted to kidnap puppies in general is pretty terrifying.
Monster of a feat by the way, kidnapping that many puppies.
I know right, she had to have known it wasn't going to work out.
Exactly, there are 100 of them and one of her?
Well no, I think she had henchman.
I think you're right, she had two from what I can remember.
