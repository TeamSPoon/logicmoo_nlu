Do you want to go see a movie with me?
Sure, what sort of movies do you like?
I like a lot of things, but right now I'm in the mood for an action/adventure type of movie.
Everyone is talking about Transformers, but I'm ambivalent. Have you seen Wonder Woman.
No but I heard a lot about it.
Really, what have you heard?
Let's see, it is mostly set during World War I.
Is it historically accurate?
Not really, they take a lot of liberties, but it is fun.
How is the acting?
I've only heard good things. They cast Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman, and the lady from Princess Bride (Robin Wright) as a major amazon.
I used to love that movie.
Me too, I was constantly quoting. I love the 'land war in Asia" thing.
My favorite is to say "Inconceivable" in a silly voice.
Yeah, it's weird that it became such a cult classic, but I love it. What else is so quotable?
Terminator is one everyone knows, even if they never watched the movie.
"Come with me if you want to live!"
And "I'll be back!"
I really like the plot of the first one, and maybe the second.
But the circles in the next bunch of movies can drive you crazy.
