Have you seen Wonder Woman yet?
No I haven't, I am not really into comic book movies.
Do you watch any of them at all?
I have seen a few, Guardians of the Galaxy, Deadpool, Watchmen, and others like that.
Batman?
Of course, I watch all of Nolan's movies.
Batman Begins was one of the best comic movies.
Yea, it would be tough to be better than that.
Wonder Woman isn't quite as good but it is close.
That is pretty high praise.
I thought it was really good, and the reviews for it are great too.
I will probably check it out, I do like the casting.
You mean Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman?
Yea, I feel like her look fits the role perfectly.
She does a great job but honestly I never thought she was the best actress.
I can see that, she had always been more for the eye candy.
Yea, she is quite beautiful, and her acting isn't terrible.
Yea, it is passable but not great.
Hope you give it a chance, let me know what you think.
I will make sure to do that!
