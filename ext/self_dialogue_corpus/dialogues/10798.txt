The fast & Furious Franchise lost a great friend when Paul Walker died.
Man don't even say that to me, I always cry.
I remember the first day we met Brian Spilner, sitting in the dinner asking for a tuna fish sandwich.
Spilner/ Don't you mean O'conor.
No, I mean Spilner; that was his undercover alias when he was after Dom in the first film.
How exactly do you remember that?
How do you not, when Dom took his ID and said "Brian Spilner? That sounds like a serial killer's name."
Oh yeah, ok, now I remember. Dude how many times did you watch that movie?
30, why is that a lot?
Yes, that is way too many, but do you wanna make it 31 because now I want to watch it again.
