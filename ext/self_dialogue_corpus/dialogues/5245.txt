Which one do you like better, Sleeping Beauty or Snow White?
Oh, that's a hard one.  Snow White is the first full length Disney so it's awesome.
But Sleeping Beauty has the three fairies and Maleficent.
Yeah, but Sleeping Beauty is hardly in her own movie.
But Snow White goes on a long time.  I mean, we spend a long time cleaning that cabin.
Well, what do you want her to do in the miners cabin?
At least in Sleeping Beauty she knew the prince before he kissed her awake.
True.  The end of Snow White is slightly creepy
I mean, oh she's a dead pretty lady, let me kiss her and marry her is she wakes up?
It is a cartoon.
