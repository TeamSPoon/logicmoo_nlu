Do you like Mariah Carey?
I used to absolutely love her.
I know even though things are different now.
Mariah Carey inspired me to be a singer.
Really can you do her high whistle note?
Yes I can it is something I worked towards.
What are some of your favorite songs?
I love her cover Without You, Dream Lover and Love Takes Time.
I really love the song Emotions.
I know that one is a lot of fun and really showcases her range.
Do you think she lost her voice now?
I think maybe the extensive recording and touring has taken it's toll.
I do like the Emancipation of Mimi album though.
Yes that is some of her new material and it is still good.
Did you see her New Year's Eve performance?
Yes unfortunately it was dreadful.
I am not sure if it was a sound check issue at all.
I would love to see her make a comeback from this.
It would be especially interesting if she did a reunion with Boys II Men.
I love that song called One Sweet Day she does with them.
