Hey, what's going on?
Not a whole lot. I'm looking forward to the weekend, though.
Do you have any big plans?
Yes. I'm going to Wrigley Field on Saturday.
Aren't the Cubs out of town?
Yes, but there's a big concert at Wrigley this weekend.
Oh nice! Who's playing?
Pearl Jam is headlining the Saturday night show.
Wow, Pearl Jam! I remeber when I got their first CD, Ten, at the record store at Harlem and Irving Plaza.
Oh right. I remember that record store.
It was called Rolling Stone, and they went out of business many years ago.
Oh that's too bad. I really loved taking the bus to Harlem and Irving and visiting that store.
Me too. We didn't have the internet back then and had to discover new music the hard way.
Haha yes! I remember "discovering" Nirvana before they got famous.
Those were the good old days.
Yes they were. I need to dig up my old Sony disc player and pop in an old CD.
Where did the time go? Pearl Jam is 25 years old already!
It seems like only yesterday that the grunge music movement took over.
Right. I bet everyone at the concert will be in their forty's.
No doubt! Well, I hope you have a great time at the concert!
