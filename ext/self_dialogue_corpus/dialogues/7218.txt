Do you like the movie Peter Pan?
The animated one from Disney? Yes!
I wanted to be Wendy Darling so much growing up.
Her character is so cute and posh.
She's also so fearless and firm in her beliefs.
I related to her a lot growing up too, feeling a lot more adult than you really were.
Oh yes, she did become the Lost Boy's mother after all.
Haha, well not long after Wendy's mother became most of their mothers.
Yes that is true.
It's a shame Peter didn't come with the rest of the Lost Boys to stay with Wendy.
