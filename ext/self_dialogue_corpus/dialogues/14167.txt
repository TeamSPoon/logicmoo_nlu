I just heard Poker Face on the radio.
Poker Face, by who?
Really, you know. Lady Gaga.
Oh, okay. That's right, I love that song.
You love it and didn't have a clue what I was talking about.
I get song titles and singers messed up sometimes
She's an excellent singer.
She really is.
I'd like to see her in concert.
Me too.
