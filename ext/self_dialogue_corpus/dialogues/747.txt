I'm worried about the future of the NFL.
Why?
The massive amounts of head and bodily injuries that mess with athletes will overwhelm people.
Really?
Look at how bad these guys turn out. More and more research shows massive injuries that aren't reversible.
But people love football.
Sort of - a lot of kids just like doing it to hurt each other. They can take out their aggression in other ways.
At least the kids like it, though.
I'm not sure they do. The parents hate it.
That's true, I see parents pulling their kids out of little league and high school football.
Less people playing equals less in the NFL.
Or, lowering their standards to allow more in. There will always be people wanting to play.
Ahh, the American dream. Get paid $10 million to play a game instead of a real job.
Ha, that's trivializing it a bit, but point taken.
I hope we find a way to make it safe, or find an alternative.
Americans are just aggressive people.
Yeah, I guess the NFL is safe, but I'm just worried that sentiment will change.
If anything, money will do it.
How so?
If cities stop supporting teams, they'll have to close down. Faded interest does mean the teams leaving.
