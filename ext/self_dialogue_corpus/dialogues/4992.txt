Hey Mike. You going to ball game?
No. I watch it from the TV.
Why do you like to watch it on the TV?
Because it's a better view. I like the commercials.
Are you being sarcastic?
No, I like the shampoo commercials.
That might make sense if it was like the Superbowl or something.
Or the world series.
Wow, is it the world series right now?
No. It's not the world series.
Then why are you watching the baseball commercials?
Because I'm an aspiring commercial actor.
I'm beginning think you don't like baseball. Is that true?
No, I like baseball because of the shampoo commercials.
Dove or Pantene?
Um. Avita is my choice actually.
Red Sox or Astros?
Pantene.
Okay, you're clearly not answering the baseball questions seriously. We're done. I'm not talking to you anymore.
Fine. I will find a new cardboard box to live in.
