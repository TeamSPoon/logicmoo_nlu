Do you like soundtracks in movies?
It depends, some dont really matter to me.
I think music is an important element in a movie
Really depends on how the story goes
Yeah I just think it adds a layer of mystique to it.
To the movie?
Well it can add drama
Yeah like some movies need it, others dont.
I guess I just prefer them
I couldnt tell you a soundtrack to a movie that I ever had to have
Grease?
What about it? that was a play
Yeah but turned into a movie
That was a movie whos premise was singing.
OK I will give you that one.
Maybe Transformers
That was just Linkin Park to be honest.
Yeah so it was hard to come up with anything.
Mission Impossible always has good ones.
They have the theme and thats about it
