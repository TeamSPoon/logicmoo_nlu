You know the Star Wars series is about good versus evil don't you?
Get out! I thought it was a coming of age movie for Luke Skywalker.
A movie can have more than one theme. In the first Star Wars movie Luke Skywalker learns that Darth Vader is his father.
Yeah, James Earl Jones did Darth Vader's voice justice. It seems like that role was written for him.
Does Stars Wars movies seem like the Indiana Jones movies that takes place in the sky galaxy?
Yeah except Harrison Ford played a whole lot older Indiana Jones than he did play a young Luke Skywalker.
I like how George Lucas uses android robots in his Star Wars series.
R2d2 reminds of Cousin It in the old school series Adams Family. (laughs)
I think Carrie Fisher  made a great Princess Leah didn't you? I wished they would have changed her hair though.
Lucas had to have a woman who could handle he own in the galaxy. I'm going to Carris Fisher in the future Star Wars movies.
