Do you know the song "Boondocks"?
I don't think so, who sings it?
It is by a group called Little Big Town.
I don't think I've ever heard of them.
Oh, you should listen to them sometime, they're a great country band.
I might do that, is it all girls in the group?
No, it's 2 girls and 2 guys in the group.
That's cool, I will check their music out.
Yeah, you'll have to listen to Boondocks. It fits your personality.
Why do you say that?
Because it is about living in the Boondocks like you do!
You're right I do live in the Boondocks.
All four of them also alternate as lead singers which is pretty cool.
Yeah sounds cool,  they all must be pretty talented.
Yeah, and one of the girls from the group also does a duet with Luke Bryan.
What's it called?
It's called Home Alone Tonight.
I think I have heard that one, I like Luke.
Yeah I love Luke Bryan, they opened for him at a concert I went to.
I would love to see Luke in concert!
