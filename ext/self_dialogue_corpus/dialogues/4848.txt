Did you hear about Chris Sale, Donny?
What about him?
Chris Sale has tied the MLB record for consecutive appearances with 10+ Strikeouts.
Oh yeah. I saw that on the Sports report yesterday.
Struck out 4 of his final 5 hitters to get it, I can't believe it!
He was in the 6th inning with the pitch count heading toward 100 and just 6 strikeouts.I thought for sure the streak would end but the absolute madman did it.
He has got to be the best pitcher in the AL by a lot.
He tied the record he had already tied in 2015.
This is the second 8 straight 10+ K streak he's had. Unreal.
Correction, he ties Pedro and himself. He had 8 consecutive 10K+ games in 2015 too.
But still.
I knew he would do great in the AL east.
Sure the offense is potent on teams but so are the strikeouts.
I hope he can win a Cy young award.
And the fact that he doesn't mess around on the mound. Just gets the ball back, says yes to the first sign his catcher puts down.
And fires nothing but strikes.
MLB needs to use him as the example of game pace.
He's really, really good.
The best strikeout Pitcher since Randy Johnson.
Chris Sale is actually very reminiscent of Johnson. Huge/tall guy with no weight.
