I am sick of Isiah Thomas.
I agree.
He gets superstar calls for no reason.
I mean his offense is fun so I am sure the NBA is slightly encouraging it.
I really hope you are wrong but it does seem he is getting lots of calls lately.
Yeah I feel bad for him too.
Yeah that stuff with his sister was terrible.
Exactly, and he still is carrying his team all alone.
What are you trying to say about Kelly Olynik?
That he is terrible at basketball.
I agree.  Plus he is dirty as could be.
Yeah he clearly is out there injuring people.
Or at least trying to.
Yeah, I wonder why the league has not done anything about it.
Probably since it is impossible to prove.
Well they could watch what he is doing out there. It is definitely dangerous.
Yeah but all players do stuff like that and it just looks like basketball.
If you aren't paying attention I could see that.
Well maybe they have said something to the Celtics.
Hopefully, also hopefully they tell him to fix his hair.  Its terrible.
