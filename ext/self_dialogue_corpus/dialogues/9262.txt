What is your favorite 80s rock band?
Oh man, so many greats in the 80s.  I'll go with Guns n Roses.
I loved Patience.  I'll say mine is Motley Crue.
They were good, too.  Who can forget Dr Feelgood?
Do you remember KISS' makeup-less phase in the 80s?
The less said about that, the better.
Completely agree-- they had a really unique look and show, so they decided to look like every other band.
I really liked Poison, too.
Every rose does have a thorn.
I see what you did there.  Nicely done.
