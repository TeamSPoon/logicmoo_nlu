I love that girl's dress.
I made one like that once.
I can't believe you can make clothes.
I have to practice for a long time to get good at it.
I'll bet. I wish I could do it.
I could show you. We could make you a dress like hers.
I'd love that. Should we go get materials today?
Sure. Let's go to the craft store.
I'd like it in a soft pink or maybe a light lavender color.
That would be pretty. You have good taste.
Thanks. I'd also like some lace on it. Do they sell lace?
They have lace, yes.
This is going to be so much fun.
Making a dress is kind of tricky. I hope you know that.
I do. I'll help as much as I can though.
I know. It will be fun but ot super easy for you on your first time.
I don't expect it to be. I hope some day I can do it myself.
You'll get there.
Making my own clothes has always been a dream of mine.
I'm glad I can help you do it then.
