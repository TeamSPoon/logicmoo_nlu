Have you watched Rogue One?
Yes I have. I have also watched the latest one too, with Rei and Kylo Ren.
Oh yeah, I thought it was a good one, but the guy playing Kylor Ren was not that convincing. Definitely not Darth Vader material.
I thought Rogue one was kinda cool, but not as engaging when you watch it on DVD. Something is missing.
I'm glad at least Donnie Yen is in Rogue one. He is a cool guy and adds depth to the movie.
Yeah like Star Wars isn't only about light saber and laser guns, but can also be about martial arts.
Rogue one i think is a good movie, but maybe because it's trying to jam a lot into a two hour movie, it seems quite complicated.
Yeah while the other Star Wars movie is one of nine and Rogue One is totally entirely a different movie with a different timeline.
Wonder if there will be a Rogue Two or something.
Yeah we'll see that would be awesome.
