I am in the mood for some good old country music. I would have to say it is my favorite genre.
I used to love country, but it sure isn't like it used to be.
Tell me about it, there are so many great artists that are not around any more.
you are right about that, they just do not make them like they used to!
I can remember my granny got me interested in country, and i loved it ever since.
My pawpaw was a huge fan of George Jones,he loved basically all of his songs.
George Jones was brilliant, I would even call him the king of country.
I used to love his corvette song and white lightning, those were my favorites.
Absolutely! Those are two classics to say the least!
What are some of your all time favorites from George?
The two you mentioned were awesome, that is a tough question because there are so many!
That is true, he certainly had his share of classics.
I loved the duets he used to do with Tammy Wynette, they had some really good songs together.
Yea they sure did, especially golden ring, two story house, and southern california.
Those are all great, so who are some other all time country favorites of yours?
I would say Johnny Cash, Keith Whitley, and Vince Gill. Those three really move me with their voices.
I agree with those, I once saw Vince gill in concert and it was a fantastic show.
That must have been great fun! Wished I could have been there!
Country music really has the ability to move your soul if it is done the right way.
I am with you there, there is nothing else like it.
