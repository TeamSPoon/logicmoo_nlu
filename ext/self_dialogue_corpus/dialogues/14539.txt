Did you think that anyone can beat Golden State in the playoffs.
Cleveland beat them last year, and San Antonio has a surprising strong team in the playoffs.
Who should get the MVP, Russell Westbrook or James Harden.
Even though neither player was enough to push their own team deep into the finals, Westbrook had a legendary regular season.
Will the NBA East continue to be weak versus the West?
As long as there are perennial big market, bad teams like the Knicks, 76ers, I think that's a yes.
Who is going to win this year's championship?
No doubt, it's time for the Warriors to take it back to Oakland, after losing the title last year.
Will anyone ever beat Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's scoring record?
It's going to be tough!  If someone like Harden or Westbrook can play late into their 30s, it's possible.
Are there too many flagrant fouls in the NBA?
I don't think so; it's just that they're recording them as such now.
Will Golden State be able to stay dominent in the West for a long time?
I'm guessing no, since their top players will all want max contracts.
What do you think about advertising on jerseys, like Philadelphia wants to do?
Heck no, Philadelphia's ownership has pulled enough shenanigans in the last few years.
Who will be the surprise team in the east next year?
I think the Knicks have a chance to make the playoffs if they can get a good player for Carmelo Anthony.
Who will be the surprise team in the west next year?
No question, it's Phoenix, led by Devin Booker.
