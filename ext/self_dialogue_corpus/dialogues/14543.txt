What is your strongpoint in basketball?
Probably just making baskets even from a distance.
Me too. I'm looking for members to start a team.
I'd be interested.
OK. We're meeting at Jordan's tomorrow at seven. Can you be there?
Yep. Can I bring Frankie and Luke?
Bring anyone you can think of.
What if we get too many members?
We'll hold tryouts then.
OK. This sounds like fun.
I agree. Basketball is good exercise.
I need to get back in shape so that's good.
We all need to get more in shape I bet.
Probably. All that running and jumping should help.
I hope it does. I want to lose thirty pounds.
I'm so glad there will be a team because I've missed playing.
So have I.
I haven't played in a while.
Neither have I but we'll get back in the swing of things soon.
I'm sure.
