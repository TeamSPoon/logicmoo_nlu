Have you seen the Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 2?
No I haven't , it looks great.
I want to go see it too, maybe we can go see it this weekend!
Who plays in it?
Most of the cast from film one are coming back, like Vin Diesel of course.
Oh yes, he played Groot in the first one.
Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, Dave Batista, Brad Cooper also are in this one too.
What is the story line for this one?
Peter Quill and his fellow Guardians are hired by a powerful alien race, the Sovereign, to protect their precious batteries from invaders.
And it gets a bit messy?
Yes, it does! Rocket has stolen the items they were sent to guard, and they go hunting after him.
It sounds fun, I want to go soon to see it, especially for the effects.
It is always better for the special effects on a big screen.
It was released in May, I just haven't had the time to go see it.
Maybe we can see it this weekend, how about Saturday?
Saturday looks ok, I will have to see if  I can get off work on that day.
Let me know if you can, and I will pick you up!
Maybe we can go to dinner before!
That sounds like a plan!
Ok, see you Saturday!
