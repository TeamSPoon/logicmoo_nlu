What's your favorite part of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone?
I love when Harry is in the zoo with the Dursley family and he accidentally lets the snake loose.
I like that part too! That's the first time Harry realizes he can talk to snakes.
I also like when Harry, Ron and Hermione have to fight past all of those different challenges to find Professor Quirrell and fight Voldemort.
That part used to scare me when I was little, especially when Voldemort and Quirrell separate from each other and Voldemort's soul is flying around the room.
I can see how that would be scary. Who's your favorite character in the movie?
I really like Hagrid. He just seems so jolly and I can tell he's going to be a big part of the rest of hte movies.
I like Hagrid too. I also think I like Snape.
Snape? How come? He's the meanest character in the whole movie!
I'm not sure why I'm drawn to him. I just feel like there's more to him than the eye can see.
