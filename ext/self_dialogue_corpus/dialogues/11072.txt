Did you see the game between the Pittsburgh Penguins and the Ottawa Senators last night?
I did, I can't believe it was such a low-scoring game.
I know right? Didn't the score end up 1-0?
Yeah it did, and the Penguins won.
Most of the games this season have been higher scoring than that.
Who ended up scoring the game winning goal for the Pens?
It was Kessel that made it.
He's playing really well this post-season.
For sure, the guy is a really good player.
Do you think they will trade him after the season is over?
I don't see how they can with the way he is playing.
That's true but you never know.
I think it depends more on who they draft.
That's right, if they draft a younger player with a good outlook they could trade him.
Do you think they can go all the way this year?
I think they can for sure, but the next series will be really tough.
I would like to see Crosby get a ring this year.
I would too, the guy is unbelievable.
He will have a chance to go down as the greatest player ever.
I don't think he will ever be as good as Gretzky was.
