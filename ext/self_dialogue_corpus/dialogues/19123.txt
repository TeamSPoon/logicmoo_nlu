No, he is more of a underground artist.
What kind of music does he do?
He is a rapper, but his rhymes are unique.
What is the name of one of his songs?

Oh wait, did he sing one about religion?
Yes he did, that is a great song.
I think I also heard one where he called out his manager.
Yes, that is Ill Mind of Hopsin 8.
I saw the video for it, so I am assuming what he is rapping about is true.

I believe so, and seems much happier.
