Did you watch Arrival yet?
I watched it a while ago. I thought it was good.
What do you think about the director?
He's one of the better ones right now but his movies are hit or miss with me. I like Sicario and Incendies but I didn't care for Prisoners.
So where would you rank this one among his movies?
It was closer to the top but not his best. I would put it at his third best, below Incendies and above Enemy.
Is there something you didn't like about it?
I thought it was a bit predictable.
Really? What part of it was predictable?
I watch a lot of time travel movies and I can spot some of the conventions when I see them in other films. I could tell early on that this would involve time displacement.
When did you figure that out?
There was some foreshadowing when she began talking to the aliens. She spotted an image that triggered a flashback and it was the kind of thing I've seen in a lot of time travel movies.
What time travel movies are you talking about?
I've seen something similar in 12 Monkeys. And then it became obvious that the aliens would cause her to displace time.
So you foresaw that there would be a universal language she would use to traverse time?
No, not specifically. But I thought the aliens might give her a gift because that also happens in a lot of movies.
And you knew that the flashback at the beginning didn't actually take place until after the movie?
Actually, no. I thought at first that they might give her a way to relive those memories, but when she revealed she didn't have a child then I knew that she was only going to have those memories going forward.
So what are some other movies I can watch about time displacement or alternate lives?
Well you can watch Triangle, Timecrimes, Coherence, Another Earth, Primer, and the list goes on and on.
