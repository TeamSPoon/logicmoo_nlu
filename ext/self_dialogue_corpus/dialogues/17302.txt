Do you like this band?
Who are they?
The Bouncing Souls.
Hmm, never heard of them but this sounds catchy.
Yeah, they are a pop punk band from the 90's early 2000s.
Name some of their songs, maybe I heard them?
Hopeless Romantic, Born to Lose, East Coast, Chunk Song?
Sounds familiar.  Were they ever on tour with anyone big?
Yeah, they toured with Bad Religion for a little.
Okay!  I know who they are.
They also played a Warped Tour here and there.
Yeah, I probably saw them at Warped Tour.  How long have they been around?
I think they formed in 1989.
And they still tour?
Yup.  They actually are coming to Pittsburgh in August with Rancid.
Are you going to go?
I was thinking about it!  I haven't been to a show like that in years!
Maybe I'll go with you!
That would be cool, the Bouncing Souls are good live!
I bet!
