Have you ever played the game Rock Band? It's sick, they have a controller now that has strings like an actual guitar.
I have not, tell me more about it man. I really love rock music!
Well, not only can you play the guitar, but there's also a microphone for vocals, a drum set, a keyboard, and a bass guitar.
Man, that's so sick! Do you have the game at your house?
Yeah, I do actually, and you'll be surprised to know that a lot of your favorite bands have songs in the game.
Really? Like, what bands have songs in that game?
A lot dude, to name a few, Green Day, Nirvana, Metallica, Aerosmith, Megadeth, and AC/DC.
Bro, I'm coming over your house today. I'll do vocals, trust me, I'm a good singer.
We'll see about that man! What time do you want to come over?
Around four o'clock, I'll be ready to rock and roll after I pick my sister up from school!
