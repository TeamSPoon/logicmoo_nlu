HAVE YOU HEARD OF THE BAND DISTRUBED?
YEAH, AREN'T THEY PRETTY HARD ROCK?
YES, THEY HAVE SOME HEAVY SONGS, BUT THEIR LYRICS ARE AMAZING.
WHEN DID YOU FIRST DISCOVER THEM?
IT WAS WELL OVER TEN YEARS AGO, THEY CAME OUT WITH THE SONG DOWN WITH THE SICKNESS AND I WAS HOOKED.
I THINK I REMEMBER THAT SONG.
THEY ALSO COVERED SHOUT BY TEARS FOR FEARS, IT WAS A REALLY GREAT UPDATE TO THE SONG.
I'LL CHECK IT OUT.
GREAT, AND WHILE WE ARE TALKING ABOUT COVER SONGS, THEY DID ONE RECENTLY THAT WAS AMAZING.
WHAT WAS IT?
THE SOUND OF SILENCE, ORIGINALLY BY SIMON AND GARFUNKLE, THEY DID AN AMAZING ROCK UPDATE TO THE SONG WITHOUT DESTROYING IT. IT WAS AMAZING.
OK, I'LL LOOK IT UP.
THEY HAVE ALSO BEEN FEATURED ON MOVIE SOUNDTRACKS.
WHAT MOVIES?
THEY WERE FEATURED ON QUEEN OF THE DAMNED, A TRANSFORMERS MOVIE, AND DISTURBIA.
WOW, THEY HAVE BEEN ON SOME BIG MOVIE SOUNDTRACKS.
YEA, THEY ARE A REALLY POPULAR HARD ROCK BAND.
WHAT SONG DO YOU RECCOMEND THAT I SEARCH BY THEM?
I'D START WITH DOWN WITH THE SICKNESS THEN HEAD TO SOUNDS OF SILENCE. THOSE ARE MY TWO PERSONAL FAVORITES.
OK, GREAT I'LL LISTEN TO THEM
