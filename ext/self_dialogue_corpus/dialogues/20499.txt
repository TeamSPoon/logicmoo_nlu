I watched the most elegant gangster movie the other day, if you can imagine such a thing.
What movie?
Brother. It is directed by Japanese auteur Takeshi Kitano.
Is it all in Japanese?
No, it's a split between Japanese and English. It takes place in LA.
What made it elegant?
You have to see Kitano's films. He brings an elegance to everything he touches, even violence.
Can you elaborate?
He doesn't do any cheesy action. The films are gritty.
That sounds grim.
It is offset by beautifully composed music.
Is the music done by anyone I know?
Joe Hisaishi. He actually scores a lot of Hayao Miyazaki's films, which I know you are a fan of.
Wow, that sounds like a strangely interesting audio/visual experience.
He also has the best Japanese fashion designer - Yohji Yamamoto - doing the costumes in this movie.
I can see how well dressed gangsters will add an air of elegance to the movie.
Another funny thing about Kitano's movies is that characters who talk a lot are always portrayed as idiots.
This is reflective of real life, I suppose.
It was his first and final foray into American cinema. It's a totally underrated movie with a compelling soundtrack.
I will have to check it out!
