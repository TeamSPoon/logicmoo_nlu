Did you ever see the original Hulk directed by Ang Lee?
No.  It was a massive bomb I think.
It did not do well.  I think they were way too focused on making it serious.
Yeah, these movies are supposed to be fun and escapist.
Edward Norton should never be a Hulk.
Agreed there.  Weird casting for sure.
Are they planning any more Hulk movies?
I think he's in the next Avengers if I remember correctly.
It'd be cool if they killed him off.
That's a pretty morbid thought!
