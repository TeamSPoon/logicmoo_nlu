Have you heard the new song by Coldplay?
What is is it called?
It is called Something Just Like This.
I think so.
It is really fun to listen to.
I like Coldplay.
The song combines Coldplays harmonious voice with a song that can be danced to.
I like the sound of that.
Yes it has good lyrics about wanting something out of life, it is powerful.
I like when sounds sound good and also have good lyrics.
