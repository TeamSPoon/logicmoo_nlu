Hey, Paulito, do you plan on going to any NFL games this year?
I'm not sure, but I sure hope to.
You travel a lot for work, have you been able to visit any stadiums when you travel?
Yes, I have been to games in Denver, Arizona, Dallas and Houston.
Wow, that's pretty good.  I have only been to a couple of games in Dallas.
Dallas has my favorite stadium, I love all of the technology that's there.
Yeah, I really enjoy it too, but I would like to visit an outdoor, cold weather stadium as well.
Wow, do you think it would be fun to watch the game in the cold?
Sure, it would be even better if it were snowing!
I don't know if I could handle it, I am to much of a Southerner.
Ha, I know what you mean, but I think the atmosphere would be amazing.
I can't argue with that.  Which stadium would you like to visit?
I think Chicago and Green Bay would be a lot of fun.
Those are two classic stadiums...Soldier Field and Lambeau Field.
Yeah.  I think a game in New York would be fun too, though I think I would enjoy Buffalo more than NYC.
I agree there, I'm not a fan of either NYC team, but I could handle watching the Bills play.
Same here.  I think it would be fun to tour all of the NFL stadiums.
Yeah, that sounds awesome.
There is so much history in those stadiums.
We should plan a five year expedition to visit them all.
