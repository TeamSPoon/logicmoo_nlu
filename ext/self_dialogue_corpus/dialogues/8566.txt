So, what new pop music have you been listening to?
Miley Cyrus has a good song that came out pretty recently. I think it is called "Malibu."
I like that one too but I think my favorite new song is "Something Just Like This" with The Chainsmokers and Coldplay.
That is a great song but nothing will ever be better than The Chainsmokers 'Selfie!"
That was a great song. I think some of the greatest pop music came from the 90s.
You're right, I'll never forget Will Smith and "Miami."
What about Aqua and "Barbiegirl" and let's not ever forget about Sir MixaLot.
Baby Got Back, I'll never forget dancing to that when the parents were away. There was such a huge obsession with Savage Garden and Celine Dion too.
Yes, "My Heart Will Go On" was everyone's favorite song for a while after Titanic. "Peaches" was another favorite that was just huge for a while.
I wish we had something comparable now to what "Peaches" was then. There is some great pop music being made but "Peaches" was iconic.
