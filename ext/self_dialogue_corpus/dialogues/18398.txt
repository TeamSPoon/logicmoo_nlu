What was the first CD you ever owned?
Ace of Base. Don't laugh.
Oh, I'm laughing.
C'mon, I was like 13 and 'I Saw the Sign' was a hit song.
What else did your junior high self purchase?
The Smashing Pumpkins, Spin Doctors...
Okay, those two had some good songs.
Oh, and of course the Reality Bites Soundtrack.
Oh, man. I think everybody had that.
The soundtrack may have been better than the movie.
You can't go wrong with 'My Sharona'. Oh, and that Lisa Loeb song.
Oh my gosh, 'Stay'. I used to sing that all the time.
Me too. It always fascinated me that it had no chorus.
I never even thought about that. It didn't, did it?
Nope, which makes its hit status that much more significant.
Yeah, the chorus is what's supposed to hook people.
And Lisa Loeb was like, nah, I don't need that.
It's a shame she never really had any more hits.
I kind of want to go find that soundtrack now.
Same. I may even look for my Ace of Base.
