Rock music is so weak today.
True. Only the older bands are really holding it up.
Bands like Muse or Royal Blood are OK but not big great rock bands.
Yea and some of the old ones are getting lame like Prophets of Rage.
A few but stuff like Jack White and Clutch are holding up.
Yea Guns n Roses were surprisingly good on this tour.
I didn't see it.
I mean it sucks there is no Steven or even Matt on drums and no Izzy but besides the drummer it's a good band. Axl is decent.
Axl is also singing for AC/DC now.
Yea I don't know what happened to Brian Johnson he was still good. Just old and sick maybe.
Metal is a young man's game.
Iron Maiden and Judas Priest still good oldies.
I was never too into them.
They aren't as good as their peak but check out their old stuff it's really good.
I need a new exciting band to come around. Can't remember the last one.
Yea maybe Golgol Bordello was last good discovery for me.
I like them yea but they are so different than hard rock or metal.
Gypsy rock. A unique band.
These kids today and their music, bah humbug!
Hope some of them get mad and make something good.
