I just saw the highlights of Superbowl V.
Colts against the Cowboys?
Yes, the first Superbowl after the merger.
Both old NFL teams, although the Colts were shifted over to the AFC.
Correct.
Who were the quarterbacks?
Johnny Unitas and Craig Morton.  Unitas was injured and replaced by Earl Morall.
Morton was competing with Roger Staubach for the job.
Right.
Who scored first?
Dallas, field goal in the first quarter.
Who was leading at the half?
Dallas, 13-6.
Who played at halftime?
Would you believe Anita Bryant?
Wow.
There was no scoring in the third quarter.
How about the fourth?
The Colts tied it and won on a field goal with five seconds left.
Dramatic.
