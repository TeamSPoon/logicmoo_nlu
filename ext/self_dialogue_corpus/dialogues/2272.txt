i am still working on that NFL trivia list for that book.
Do you need some help?
Yes please. Tell me what you think of some of the ones I have.
Here let me get you started with one I saw.The Washington Redskins were the last segregated team in the NFL.
I have never heard that before.
Also did you know that Tony Dungy is the first African-American coach to win a Super Bowl.
Oh you know that speaking of people of different ethnicities did you know that there is  56 % chance of American Samoans  to be drafted.
It makes since they are some big boys.
Running back Ricky Williams is a qualified yoga instructor.
That is a great thing to be. I wonder if any of his fellow players do yoga?
I know that I heard at one time that some players took ballet for flexibility  and balance.
Is that really true?
NFL Hall of Fame member Lynn Swann even credits his graceful performance in games in part to flexibility that he learned from ballet training and other dance classes, adding that this training helped him achieve body control, balance and a sense of rhythm and timing.
Wow that's cool they don't let it effect their masculinity.
Patriots defensive lineman Richard Seymour plays the trombone. I thought that was pretty cool.
Yeah he may play but does he play well?!!
Good point! I guess you would have to ask those around him!
It sounds like you are coming along pretty well.
Thanks! I am not sure where I am going next
Good luck and let me know when you have some more you want me to listen to.
