Who are you crowning for MVP this year?
Harden had one of the best seasons ever.
He played out of his mind.
I think that has to do with the guys around him.
Yeah they werent that good.
So he was taking the majority of shots.
The offense ran through him.
You also cant discount Westbrook either.
I think he was in a similar situation.
The amount of triple doubles he had is astounding.
Well for a guy with no other options it was par for the course.
Could Oscar Robertson do that in todays NBA?
Probably  could still do it.
So we have it narrowed down, who you giving it to.
I would say Harden.
Its good that its a debatable question.
I think James is mad he wasnt on the list.
I mean as far as value to his team, i dont know.
Harden was the team.
And so was Westbrook.
