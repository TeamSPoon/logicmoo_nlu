What band do you like?
I like Radiohead.
They know how to play music.
Yup,I love their second album.
I like this last. Do you like it?
No, not really.
Why?
I felt that it's more like dance music.
Yeah, that's true but it gets me moving.
I just liked it when it had less keyboards.
They did play with a lot of effects.
Utah, but on a guitar.
How many guitar played do they have?
3 with Thom.
That's pretty cool.
I guess I could give them a second look.
You should, the ideas are still there.
Your right,I just didn't like cannabis music.
It's not that bad.
It is
