Have you gotten a chance to see Deadpool?
No I havent gotten to see it yet, how was it?
I'm pretty sure it was the greatest comic book movie of all time.
Of all time?  That's kind of bold.
It's pretty hard to top, the humor in it was pretty great and it had a great story.
Wasn't it a bit graphic?
Yea, that's kind of the point though.
How do you figure?
Comic movies have always been PG-13, this is one of the rare cases that they took a chance on making it rated R.
Why does that matter?
It means the film industry is willing to give it a shot.  If Deadpool does extremely well you're bound to see more movies come out rated R.
That would be great.
Yea, in fact I think they already have one scheduled because of how well Deadpool is doing.
Who is it about?
I think it's about Wolverine.
Wolverine?  Now a rated R Wolverine movie would be awesome.
Yea I think they are doing it in the future.
Wait, they are doing old man Logan?
Yea that's what I heard.
I am so excited to see Deadpool now.
