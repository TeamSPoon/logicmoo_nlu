Hey man
What's up?
I just got this new cd
Really?  You buy cds?
Yea I love supporting artists
Interesting.
Yea I find that they get the most royalties from hard copies vs digital
Oh, I never knew that!
Yea they have different contracts for the different forms of media
Ah, I'm following you
Yea but concerts are even more supporting of artists
How so?
They actually make a huge chunk of the sales
Oh I didnt know that!
Yea I try to also hit up concerts whenever possible to support them
I'm going to start doing that too!
Yea It's a great idea and of course the music is awesome!
Good to know!
I gotta run
Later man!
