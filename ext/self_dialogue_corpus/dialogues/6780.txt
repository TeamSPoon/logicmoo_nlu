What is your favorite Toy Story movie?
I like the first one.
Why is that?
The relationship between Buzz and Woody is deep.
Yeah, there was a lot of growth in that one.
The second and third ones are great. But, the first one is amazing.
I agree. It has everything.
Pixar did a great job with that movie.
Do you think the 4th one will be good?
Yes, I do. Pixar is awesome at telling stories.
