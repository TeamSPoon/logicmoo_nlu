Don't you wish you had the spirit of Bagger Vance?
Will Smith in the movie The Legend of Bagger Vance, that Bagger Vance?
Yes, he had some real Yoda stuff going on for him.
I enjoyed that movie, but it has been quite sometime when I last saw it.
Well, it was made in 2000, so it is kind of old.
Did you know that movie was directed by Robert Redford?
He is a great director, I think I did know that but I forgot about it.
Matt Damon and Charlize Theron were really good in it too.
Matt Damon was so cute. I loved Adele Invergordon, Charlize's character in the move.
She was a real spit fire wasn't she?
Yes, she was. What was the name of the golfer Matt played?
Rannulph Junuh, he was the narrators childhood idol.
Oh, that's right. I liked the scene where Bagger could sense the movement of the grass by feeling the breeze of the wind.
He would say little things that were sarcastic but had a real life lesson to it.
I thought about some of his sayings about my life when I was watching it.
Will Smith always has that cool factor about himself.
I think he is probably like that in real life.
Was Jack Lemmon, the one that was narrating the story.
Yes, he starts the story as a boy his name was Hardy Greaves, and he admired Rannulph Junuh so much.
Yeah, then he dies on the golf course playing golf, the game he loved his entire life.
