Hey, are you excited for the new transformers movie?
Not really, I don't like transformers.
Really? Why not?
It's so commercialized. It's barely even a movie. I can't even understand what's happening on the screen most of the time.
Yea I agree, they've gotten a little crazy with the special effects.
It's dumb, they are just trying to sell cars and toys to people.
I guess so, but it's still pretty epic. The plot is pretty good too.
Not really, in the new one optimus prime turns rogue and they have to stop him. It's dumb.
No its not, that's the same plot they used for the new Fast and Furious.
Yea, exactly.
