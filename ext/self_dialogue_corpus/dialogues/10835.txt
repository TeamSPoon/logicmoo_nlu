Have you seen The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift?
No, I haven't seen that one.
It's pretty good, you should watch it.
Didn't that come out a while ago?
Yeah it came out in 2006.
Wow that's so long ago. What's it about?
It's about the underground racing scene in Japan and how a troubled teen gets involved with it.
It sounds pretty good.  Who's in it?
Bow Wow and Lucas Black
I'll have to check it out.
