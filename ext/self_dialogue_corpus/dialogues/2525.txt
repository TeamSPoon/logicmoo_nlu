So who for you is the most disappointing QB ever?
Ever? Greatest rolls off the brain easy, but most disappointing? That one's tough.
I would have to say that Johnny Manziel by the Browns is mine.
I nearly forgot he played for them. I'm going to say Jay Cutler.
Cutler took the bears to the playoffs, why him?
I would say its more like the Bears took him to the playoffs...
Lol, I can see that. But why Cutler?
It's just that he seems to struggle when the stakes are high, he throws Ints and fumbles, like he forgot how to play..
Yeah, I like the Lions,but Stafford has some games like that too.
Ok, what about Mark Sanchez?
Oh yeah, he's a lot like Cutler, but with him it feels like overconfidence gets him more.
Yeah, the team, whether its the Jets or the Eagles, get rolling and it is fumble or interception time for him.
Yeah, I see him miss the Safety on deep throws all the time. Cutler is more inconsistent, but usually he misses a Blitz and goes down.
That was a problem for Kaepernick too at times. He wants to rush or holds it too long trying to make a play happen.
That's a big peeve of mine, so many times the plays that just wreck the game for the team are those "make a play" ones.
I know, you need to be able to say when a play has failed and throw it away and regroup.
To me, that's the mark of  a great vs. bad qb. Saying "nope, not gonna happen today" when they need to.
I agree, I also think the greats are good at shaking off the mistakes.
No doubt! Sanchez threw an INT or Cutler would and then the next set would be another turnover.
I know, but with Manning, he'd look awful for 3 downs, and then when the ball is back in his hands it's like it never happened.
