So now that you have finished the entire series, what is your final Snape opinion?
Oh wow, I don't even know yet. I am still processing. I think I have always felt like Snape wasn't evil.
Even at the end of Half-Blood Prince?
Yes, I had a feeling more was going on. Good old Rowling!
Yeah, I had my doubts though. I still don't think he is all good. I mean, he still did really bad things.
I agree. And the reason he was good-ish at the end was because he was obsessed with a dead woman who didn't even love him!
Exactly! But man, I was crying with the whole Snape flashback.
Alan Rickman was absolutely amazing at that part. That was incredibly emotional.
He really was. And people say that's a kid's movie!
Right! It so isn't! Snape redeemed himself.
