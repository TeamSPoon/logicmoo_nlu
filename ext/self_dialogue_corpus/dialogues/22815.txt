Did you see the trailer for the new Jumanji movie yet?
The one with the Rock, Kevin Hart, Jack Black, and Karen Gillan?
Yeah! I just saw the trailer today and it brought back so many memories from the original Jumanji I watched as a kid.
I caught it just before you came out here, and I have to disagree. It looks like they changed so many things!
I think I welcome these fresh takes. I know the original with Robin Williams will forever hold it's place in adventure and fantasy as far as movies go but this new one looks to be a lot of fun!
I think the Rock and Kevin Hart showed good chemistry in Central Intelligence so with them being together again for this there might be hope.
I really like that tandem. I think Jack Black and Karen Gillan are great additions too.
Did you see the scene where she does a running roundhouse flying kick to someone on a motorcycle?
That looked really good! I liked the effects I saw from the animals rampaging around. It looks like it's going to be action packed.
What I got from the trailer was that the kids are playing Jumanji, but it's not a board game anymore, it's a video game now.
That's what it looks like. I don't mind. They have to modernize things a bit for the audience today.
That's true, let's be real, kids these days don't exactly gather around to play board games as much as our time.
Right, so that's why the Jumanji movie coming up has made it a point to present something they can relate to, video games.
I'm still a bit skeptical. I probably won't see it on opening night, but depending on how people respond to it I'll decide then.
I think it opens a few days after the new Star Wars!
Wow, that's going to be kind of tough to try to win over audiences.
It's going to be a challenge for Jumanji to make an impact with Star Wars releasing.
I know I will for a fact go watch the opening for Star Wars!
Get ready to wait in long lines!
It'll be worth the wait I'm sure!
