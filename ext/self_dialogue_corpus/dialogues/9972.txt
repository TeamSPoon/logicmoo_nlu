Have you seen any of Steven Seagal's movies.
Yes, I have seen all his older ones.
Why not the new ones.
His new ones are pretty low budget B movie face, His 80s and 90s stuff is the best.
Which ones are good.
Under Siege was one of his best. He is pretty much the only guy free on an Aircraft Carrier and he has to save everyone else.
That sounds cool. Wasn't there a sequel.
Yes, It was set on a train. It was pretty good too. Eric Bogosian was great as the villain.
I will check those out. Any others you would recommend?
Hard to Kill was good, so was Out for Justice. They have lots of action!
