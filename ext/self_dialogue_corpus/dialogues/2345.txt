Why hast Kaepernick been signed yet?
Thats a question we wont ever answer!
Why not?
Because he isnt that good I guess.
I think the league is racist
Now thats a terrible take.
Why is Glennon getting money but he cant get a backup job?
Glennon hasnt shown that he is terrible.
Not yet.
Right, so you pay for potential
And Kap?
He has shown he cant handle an offense.
He was in the Super Bowl
Yeah with a great defense.
Running QB can succeed in todays game.
Sure they can but they wont
Why do you say that?
The beating they take is too hard.
Yeah but they are use to it
No conditioning will withstand that
