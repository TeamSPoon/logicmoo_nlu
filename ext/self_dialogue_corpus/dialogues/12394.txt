What are your thoughts on Luke Skywalker?
Kind of nerd, but ultimately turned into a pretty bad a** dude.
Yeah, he got ripped in Empire
Well I wouldn't say exactly ripped.
Well he showed of his guns while carrying Yoda in Dagoba
Yeah, that's true. Had that back pack thing to carry him.
Then he had that cool black outfit in Jedi
Oh yeah, with the black glove.
Yeah because his hand was shot in battle.
Yeah, Jabba's sand cruiser thing.
