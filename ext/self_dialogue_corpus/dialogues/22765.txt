Have you seen the movie The Bucket List?
Isn't Jack Nicholson in that?
Yes he is and so is Morgan Freeman.
Oh yeah I have seen that movie and I really liked it.
I just watched it the other day for the first time and it was one of the best I've seen in awhile.
Yes it is a really good movie and I bet it made you cry at the end.
I was bawling like a baby at the end of it. You have no idea!
That is funny. It was sad at the end though.
Yes especially when you saw the two coffee cans with their ashes in them at the top of Everest.
One of my favorite parts was when Edward took Carter to the racetrack.
Oh I know and Carter got to drive the Mustang Shelby!
That really made me smile.
Me too! I loved when they were sitting at the top of the pyramids. The view from up there would be great.
Yeah it's too bad you can't really do that. I was happy when Edward made up with his daughter.
And he got to meet his granddaughter! It was just sad knowing she wouldn't get to know him for very long.
At least he got to meet her though. Did the movie make you want to create your own Bucket List?
Yeah of course I've got several things I want to do before I die.
I think all of us probably do. I'm not sure if it's quite as fun as in the movie though.
Talking about it has got me wanting to watch it again.
Yeah me too. Let's go see if it's on Netflix or Hulu.
