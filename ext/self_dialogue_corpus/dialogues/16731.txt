What do you think about Lil Yachty?
Is he one of those mumble rappers?
What is a mumble rapper?
You know, mumble rap. These guys who rap about nothing and all sound the same.
Yeah I think I know what you mean. With that autotune, I can't tell Lil Yachty apart from any of the rest of them.
He has maybe one song that is catchy, but his lyrics are so juvenile.
Exactly! Just mumbling nonsense right?
Right. What's the one song he has that sounds like a playground song?
I Spy with my little eye?
Yeah, that's the one. I think it is so ridiculous.
Oh, you mean you don't like rap songs that sound like nursery rhymes?
I think it is a cute song for kids in middle school maybe.
I think elementary school is more like it.
Well I've never listened to much to the lyrics, but I think maybe there is some PG-13 content.
Yeah, I think it might have some explicit lyrics, but the content is very immature.
I agree. I don't understand this type of music. And what is up with his voice?
Lil' Yachty does sound kind of slow.
That's the way you rap when your rhymes are so simplistic.
He makes feel-good music. Music you can just dance to without thinking.
I think his songs are funny.
