What is the last lady Gaga song that you heard?
To be honest, I heard a podcast but haven't bought an album since the fame monster!
I heard that her real name is Stephanie!
It's Stefani Joanne Angelina Germonotta. Have you heard the song Bad Romance?
Have I? Lady Gaga is one of my top favorites. I like the song Lemonade ft. Beyonce
I wonder when she will come to San Francisco, next.
I want to get some Lady Gaga apparel! Her new fan website is amazing.
Lady Gaga was born in 1986 but her clothes represent three different decades. I love lady gaga!
I will let you know when the next Lady Gaga concert is and I will give you a ring!
Okay definitely.
