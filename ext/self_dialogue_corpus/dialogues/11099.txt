Janice, what are you doing today?
Nothing much, I was planning on staying in and reading a book.
Have you not opened your windows today? It is beautiful and sunny.
I just got out of the shower, grabbed a book, and a cup of coffee.
Did you you brush your teeth?
Yes, I brushed my teeh, but I couldn't find anything to wear so I just decided to stay inside.
Well I have a better idea.
What great idea do you have sister?
How about you, Stacy, and I hook up and hit the mall.
I don't know if I am feeling like going to the mall today, i look a mess.
That's why I'm telling you to get up and let's go and get some clothes.
I don't have much money.
Don't worry, Stacy just got paid. She got us.
Girl, you are hilarious.
I know.
So where is Stacy now?
She's right here listening to everything we are saying. She has her credit cards ready.
Okay, so let me get dressed. How long will it take for you guys to get here?
We are at the door. Open up. It's time to get your wardrobe together.
I'm ready.
