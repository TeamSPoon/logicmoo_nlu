I wonder if they'll make another Suicide Sqaud?
Probably. Hollywood just loves sequals.
That's true!
The first one was pretty good. I'll bet they will make another.
Will Smith was so good in that movie.
Definitly my favorite character.
What was the deal with Captain Boomerang?
Not sure. He was in the comics.
I didn't understand that charachter at all.
Yeah, it was a little weird.
My biggest problem with the movie is that the previews gave away all the best punchlines.
I stayed away from the previews.
Smart.
Yeah, same thing happend to me with Dead Pool.
Yeah, but they didn't give away all the goods.
True, but it was still a little disappointing.
Not as disappointing as Wolverine: Origins!
True. Total bomb.
The only reason Ryan Reynolds did it, was because they threatened him with not being able to do anymore Marvel.
Hmmm...interesting.
