Inception was a real mind trip
I really liked Leonardo Dicaprio's character
The whole storyline was so unique it kept me engaged
The ending was really good too.
Yea, I didnt see that coming
Seeing people's dreams and being able to change their minds is pretty cool
It would be a great super power
Maybe one day, we can do something like that with technlogy
Do you think their will be a sequel?
I don't know, it doesnt need one but it would be awesome to see some of the characters again.
