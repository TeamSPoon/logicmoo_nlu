Have you seen Cars 3 yet?
No, I hadn't realized it was coming out so soon.
It came out last weekend.  At least I think it did.
Do you know what it's about?
I'm not sure, but I can't wait to see what kind of trouble Mater gets into this time.
Poor Mater.  He always stumble in to some kind of trouble, doesn't he?
Yes he does, and then Lightning McQueen is generally right there with him.
True.  They kind of bail each other out.
Well, Whatever this one is about, I'm sure it will be enjoyable.
I agree.  Maybe we should find out when it's playing and go.
