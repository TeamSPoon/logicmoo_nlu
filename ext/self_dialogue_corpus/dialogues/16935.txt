What's your favorite boy band?
Gosh, probably the Backstreet Boys but that's a tough call!
I love them too.  They have such a great classic sound to them.
Yeah they do, and they are wholesome unlike so many bands today.
Yes.  Their first album was in 1996, but they released one just recently in 2013.
I didn't know they just released one!
Yeah, it was their 20th anniversary album.  It's hard to believe they've been around that long.
I guess they're not boys anymore.
No, but they're still making great music.
They're the best selling boy band in history, aren't they?
That's what I heard.  My favorite song is still I Want it That Way.
I love that one, but I also really like The One.
Yeah, they have a greatest hits album that's pretty awesome.
Oh yeah, I can listen to that whole album without skipping a song.
Yeah, me too.
They actually had a joint tour with New Kids on the Block, which is kinda cool.
Oh that is neat!  I would've loved to see that.
Yeah, and they've started filming some movies now.
Oh, really? I guess that was inevitable.
Yeah, music and film seems to cross so much lately.
