Did you hear about what happened with the Han Solo movie?
No what happened with the Han Solo movie?
Kathleen Kennedy fired the directors working on the Han Solo movie?
Really? Why? They were already shooting the film!
The directors were removed due to creative differences.
Wow! So who is the director now?
The new director is Ron Howard, it was just announced today.
Ron Howard, I would not have expected that at all.
Its not a complete surprise. Prior to filming Episode I, he was one of three directors that George Lucas asked to help direct Episode 1.
Neat, I never expected Ron Howard to be a Star Wars fan. Hopefully, this won't affect the release date for the movie.
