Who was your favorite Beatle?
I'd have to say Paul.
How come Paul?
It's hard to pick but I liked his career.
Wings was a great band.
I know he played with his wife Linda.
It's cool he could play with his wife.
They had some great songs.
I liked Jet alot.
It's fun listening to that song on the radio.
He was so talented. It's not a surprise he was successful.
I know he was successful for decades.
I liked his song Yesterday.
That was a very somber song.
It's fun to play on guitar.
I liked how much emotion his music brings.
He really gets you to think about life.
I always preferred that over technical music.
I like musicians with skill but they have to connect with me.
That's what Paul did so well.
