Jim Henson made some really good movies but a few were kind of creepy.
What do you mean? Isn't he the Muppets dude?
Yeah he's the Muppets dude but have you seen the Dark Crystal?
Sure, I remember that movie when I was a kid. It was spooky.
That's what I'm saying. I felt bad for those little dudes.
Me too, they were called Gelflings I believe.
How in the world do you know that?
I honestly don't know, it just sorta popped into my head.
What were the vulture creatures called? They were mean.
I don't remember that but yeah, they were really mean.
Did you ever see Labyrinth?
No, my mom thought it was too far out there and wouldn't let me watch it.
There were definitely some odd characters in that one too.
David Bowie was in that movie wasn't he?
Yeah, he and jennifer Connelly.
I have always had a crush on Jennifer Connelly.
Yes, she is definitely a looker.
Is she married?
I'm pretty sure she is and has a couple of kids.
Man I was in love with her in the Rocketeer.
