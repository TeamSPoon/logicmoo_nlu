Did you see that the Green Bay Packers picked up Bennett this offseason?
Yeah, I can't believe he left the Patriots though.
I think after he won his ring last year, he was just looking for a new atmosphere to play in.
It's hard to believe he has been with so many teams, I feel like every year it's someone new.
He wasn't exactly a bust in Chicago, but that squad wasn't very good so it didn't really go anywhere.
He was in Carolina too, but not many people remember that.
I had forgotten that he was a Panther for a short time, I just keep thinking about Chicago and New England.
Green Bay will be a change for him, but he will be going from one great quarterback to another.
He is so lucky that at the end of his career he will be able to say that he has caught passes from both Brady and Rodgers!
Hopefully, he will have won a superbowl with each, too!
Well, he has a better chance in Green Bay than in Chicago or New York.
I wonder why Seattle didn't take a look at him, playing with his brother would've been fun.
I think that Seattle seems set at tight end, but from a personal standpoint, he would've had fun.
I'm sure Michael would've liked sparring with him at practice!
The way they both have so much passion for the game, it's easy to see why they are both successful.
Yeah, Martellus will add an energy to the Green Bay locker room that will make them stand out.
Kind of like his brother in Seattle, right?
Both guys are so passionate, but in different ways. Martellus is much more playful in his execution.
Probably because he is on offense, rather than defense, so the energy is a bit different.
He does add something interesting to each team he has played on, so we will have to see how Green Bay uses him.
