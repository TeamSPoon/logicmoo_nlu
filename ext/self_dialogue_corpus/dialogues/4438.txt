What are your thoughts on the revenant movie?
Leonardo DiCaprio is a great actor but this role was overrated.
What? This is the role he finally won an oscar with.
That is exactly my point. I think he deserved an oscar for multiple other roles outside of this one.
I thought Leonardo DiCaprio's oscar was well deserved for this role.
I think he deserved an oscar.. in general. But I THINK THE ACADEMY JUST HAD TO GIVE HIM ONE AT THIS POINT AND OTHER ROLES WERE MORE DESERVING.
I for one am just glad he finally got an oscar for anything. it had been a long time coming.
I do agree with you there. He had given so many worthy performances.
Leonardo DiCaprio is one of the greatest living actors ever.
I would even argue for all time.He is really up there for me. I think many more oscars are in his future or at least performances worthy of an oscar.
