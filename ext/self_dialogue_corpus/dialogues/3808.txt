What's the best thriller of all time?
On the internet people tend to say that Inception is one of the best!
I haven't seen that movie yet, can you describe the plot?
There's a team of specialists who are able to infiltrate people's dreams and plant an idea
That's cool, but why would they want to plant an ideas in someone's mind?
You'll have to see the movie!
Who is famous in that movie?
There's Leonardo Dicaprio and some others
I'm thinking of another guy's face but I don't know his name... Joseph something.
Oh, Joseph Gordon Levitt! He's great in the movie!
