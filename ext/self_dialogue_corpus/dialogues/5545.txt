What's the worst Disney cartoon you've ever seen?
Probably Dumbo.  You?
The Hunchback of Notre Dame.
Oh yeah, I completely forgot about that one.  Truly one of Disney's darker moments.
It just wasn't a fun movie.  A box office failure to boot.
It's hard to make a good story about a hunchback.
Kind of sad really.  They had a talented lineup of musical players.
Yeah, but good music can only overcome so much.
I think Disney learned it's lesson: stick with princesses.
That's always a recipe for success.
