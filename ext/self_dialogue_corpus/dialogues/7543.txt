Harry complained way too much in this movie.
You think so?
Absolutely.  He basically screamed at his friends the whole time.
Well, in his defense, you try being the chosen one.
Just because he was pressured doesn't mean he should yell at Hermione and Ron the whole time.
Well, look at it from Harry's perspective.  It was a great burden he never asked for.
Just because you are facing adversity doesn't mean being rude to people.
Ron didn't help things either.  He was always jealous of Harry.
I don't know why.  He got to marry Herimione.
Yeah, he did get lucky in the end.
