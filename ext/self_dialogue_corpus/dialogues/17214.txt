Did you hear new song from Darius Rucker?
Who? The name sounds familiar...
He is a country artist. The song is " If I told you"
Oh, yeah! I love that song!
He also did Wagonwheel.
Yeah, he is very good. I like both of those songs.
He used to sing for Hooty and the Blowfish.
OH yeah!! That's where I know that name. I remember him in the 90's. Wonder why he changed genre?
I think he is from Carolina, grew up country.
Yeah, I guess. It is weird for an artist to change genre of their music.
Well, I am glad he did, he is good singing country.
It is very popular song, I do like it.
Most every song he does goes up the charts. Seems like everyone likes it.
I know Wagonwheel was popular too. They played it to death on the radio.
Do you have a fav country artist?
I love Kenny Chesney, he is the best.
Really, me too. I haven't heard new music from him this year.
He is on tour now but going into the studio in the fall.
Oh, looking forward to hearing from him again... his songs always top the charts.
I know, I tried to get tickets for his concert a few months back, sold out.
