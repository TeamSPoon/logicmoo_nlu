Which Beatle do you think had the best solo career.
I'd need a minute to think about that. Do you have an answer ready?
Yeah, I think that it's definitely John Lennon. Plastic Ono Band is one of my all-time favs.
That's a great record. As far as number of quality releases, it's hard to argue with Paul having the best career.
I don't know. Paul has so much mediocrity and overly commercial stuff.
That's true, but the sheer number of great albums, with the Wings and with Linda, like Ram, surely put him first.
Well, I do think John Lennon had the best solo career, but the question of best solo Beatle album is different.
Indeed. My favorite is Ram by Paul McCartney.
That is a very off kilter album for Paul, I can see why you'd like it. George Harrison's double album All Things Must Pass is my favorite.
Oh man! I forgot about that one!
