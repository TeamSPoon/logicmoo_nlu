Heard any good instrumental music lately?
Nothing that really stands out for me.  I have been listening to older stuff.
Like who, in particular?
Yanni, David Arkenstone, and I think David Lenz.
Those are all really good!
I think I like Yanni the best.
He has some pretty good songs.  I don't like the ones with vocals, though.
No, me either.  I like the album where he is at the Acropolis.
Oh, the "Live at the Acropolis"?  That IS a good one.
I used to play it on repeat, back when it first came out.
It's pretty good ambient music, too.
I like it a lot.  I play it when I have housework to do, stuff like that.
I bet that helps the housework go a little faster.
It really does.  I HAVE to have music while I work.
Me too.  I always feel like it is taking forever without music.
Is Yanni the one who was in a relationship with Linda Evans?
The lady from that old Dynasty show?
Yes, that's the one!
I really don't know.  I don't pay attention to things like that.
I guess I'll have to look it up, and I will try and find some more music like his, too.
