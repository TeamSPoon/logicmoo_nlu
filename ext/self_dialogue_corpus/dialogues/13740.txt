Lady Gaga just released a new single.
Oh, yeah? I hadn't heard it.
It's called The Cure. It's awesome.
Is it on radio? What's it sound like?
It sounds like summertime, if that makes sense. The lyrics are really good.
Her lyrics are always great. Does she write her own lyrics?
I'm pretty sure. She's a really talented musician.
Agreed. She's also just such a cool artist.
I know. She dances, has amazing costumes, her videos are so innovative.
That's why I love her so much.
