Did you like Dumb and Dumber?
I never was a fan of any of the Dumb and Dumber movies?
Really?  You didn't find them to be funny?
Not really.  I don't really care for Jim Carey though.
Oh, I think he is hilarious!
Dumb and Dumber is just too repetitious and you don't have to think.
That's what's great about it.
I mean, whatever floats your boat.
You didn't like any of the sequels?
They were worse than the originals.
