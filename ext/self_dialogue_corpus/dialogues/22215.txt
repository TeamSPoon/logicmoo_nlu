Have you seen Tin Cup?
I have. It's a classic golf movie
It sure is. What's your favorite part?
My favorite part is the end when Kevin Costner is down to one golf ball and needs to hit an incredible shot.
He put on a pretty good show for the fans. I'm surprised he made it
you had to expect he was going to put that last ball on the green. It's hollywood!
that's true. I kind of thought he would make it on the first shot and win the tournament
I did too, but as soon as that didn't happen I thought he might hit a bunch in the water!
I have watched that movie so many times it's one of favorites.
Mine too. I watch it about once a month or whenever the wife is out of town.
who was the female actress in that movie?  I can never remember her name.
I think it's Susan Sarandon?
that sounds right.
She's fairly attractive in the movie.
Yes she is. I don't know if she helped shooter out or hurt him in the long run.
I think she helped in with the psychology of the game, but hurts him with the love interest.
I would agree.
I wonder what kind of golfer Shooter would have been if she wasn't in the picture.
I guess we'll never know.
I guess you're right!
