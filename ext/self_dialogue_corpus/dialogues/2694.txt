Do you collect any sports paraphernalia?
Actually I do! I'm a big Pittsburg Steelers fan.
What kind of stuff do you collect?
Well, lots, I've got a few jerseys.
Any favorites?
Maybe Ben Roethlisberger's? I wear it when I watch playoff games.
Anything else?
Basically anything I can get my hands on. Bumper stickers, T-shirts...
So basically everything.
Yeah. I'm a huge fan.
This makes me feel less alone.
Do you collect NFL paraphernalia?
Some.
Like what?
I own every Oakland Raiders jersey for the current team.
That is a lot.
And most of the past ones they sell.
This is starting to sound excessive.
I can't help it! I'm a big fan!
Well, I guess I can't fault you for it.
