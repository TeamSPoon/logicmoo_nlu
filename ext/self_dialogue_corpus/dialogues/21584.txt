Have you seen Wonder Woman yet?
No, I haven't. I'm not sure if I will see it.
How come? I've heard really great things about it.
The controversy about Gal Gadot is really getting to me.
That's fair, but we see movies all the time that have people in the US military in them.
That's true. It just feels like a bigger deal with everyone talking about it.
I mean, Adam Driver was a marine.
He's from the new Star Wars movie?
The Force Awakens, yes.
Yeah. People have been so mean to him about what he looks like!
I know! He's shy taking pictures because of it.
I would be too.
I'm excited for Last Jedi, though.
Rey is absolutely going to be a Skywalker. It's obvious.
Yeah. Is there anything you're looking forward to?
I can't wait to see Black Panther.
I saw the trailer for that! It looks so good.
It's so good to see that kind of representation on screen.
Did you know that one of the big women on the design team worked on Fruitvale Station?
No way! I think they put together an amazing team. We should see it when it comes out.
