Did you see the Orioles game yesterday?
Yeah, I thought my TV color was messed up because everything looked pink.
I know, It took me a minute to realize they were actually wearing pink for Mother's Day.
Kind of a disappointing loss.
Yeah, had them down 5-0 at one point.
Yup, All it takes is one big inning.
Still can't believe they got swept.
Right, especially after blowing the save vs the Nats right before this series
I think we've only lost like 2 series all year
Still feels like we are slumping big time
That could change when Britton gets back
I never thought having a shutdown closer was so important
Now you know what the Nationals feel like lol
Davis had a big shot yesterday
Hopefully he's getting his groove back
Yeah, I was starting to get worried about him.
He's not a liability defensively but he's not living up to his reputation right now
Eh, we've got enough people in the line-up who can put the ball in play that we can afford a HR lull from time to time.
Schoop is turning into one of the most reliable players we have.
Yup, that's why Buck has him batting 2nd.  I wouldn't be surprised if he or Manny take Hardy's spot as short next year.
