When is the 2017 draft anyway?
it's already over. It was back in April
Oh. Ok. Anyone good?
About the same number as usual 253 players. Of them I'm sure many are good.
Who was the worst team last year? Browns?
Yes. They picked a defensive end. Myles Garrett
How much did he get?
fully guarnteed 30 mill for 4 years and 20 mil signing bonus.
Tha;s a lot of money, for running around chasing a guy with a ball.
Hey man, that's an important job.
Woo what happened with that RB from LSU
Leonard Fournette?
Yeah. Where did he end up? He was a beast mode
He got picked up by Jaguars.
How much did he get?
227 mill contract with 18 in signign bonus.
Wait, so he gets paud less than a DE?
Well, the number 1 pick DE, yes.
That's gotta sting a bit
i don't think so. 50 mill vs 45 mill, not a big difference. Sure it's extra 5 mil, but you still have 45 million bucks. That's a lot for anyone.
