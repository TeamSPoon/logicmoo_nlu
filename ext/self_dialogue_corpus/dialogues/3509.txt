Hey, did you see that new Alien movie yet?
Covenant? Not yet
Dude, I went on opening night
How was it?
It was really, really bloody
Was it better than Prometheus?
It was way better than Prometheus. I thought it actually made Prometheus a better movie?
In what way?
It really connected the dots from Prometheus
Wow. Sounds great!
