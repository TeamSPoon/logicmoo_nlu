What was the name of that first guy, before Mike Patton?
You mean in Faith No More? Chuck Moseley.
Yeah, that dude. I keep hearing how good the first two albums are, but I can't get past his voice.
It's a bit of a barrier, isn't it. It always sounds like he's got a head cold.
Yeah, I guess so. I was wondering if it was just my preconceptions, because I was so used to Mike Patton and... well, you know what his voice is like.
No, it's not just you. I'd like to hear most of Introduce Yourself with Patton on the vocals; it'd be a lot like The Real Thing, I think.
I wouldn't go that far. Then again, I haven't been able to really pay attention to the music.
I think it's reasonable; The Real Thing was mostly written with Chuck Moseley in mind. Mike Patton strolled in with basically a completed album, and sang the words in front of him.
Oh, God. I can't fathom how that would have sounded -- all those epic anthems and things.
I can sort of hear it with "Epic," speaking of. Maybe "Underwater Love"?
