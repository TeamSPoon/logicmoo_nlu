do you like the fast series?
what's the 'fast' series?
the fast and the furious movie series, do you know it?
yes, though i'm not concerned about tools
what do you mean tools?
well i was under the impression the movies were regarding vehicles, is this correct?
yes, it's always got a car race or car chase scene
a car is a vehicle, a vehicle is a tool
do you think the fast and the furious are tool movies?
uhh, like all subjects in life, what i think is of no relevance;  the facts are clear
