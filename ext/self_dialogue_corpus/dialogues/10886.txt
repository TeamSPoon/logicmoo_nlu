What did you think of the Fast and the Furious movies?
I thought they were ok.
Why just ok?
I just miss Paul Walker.  I really watched those movies because of him.
Yea it's pretty sad that he's gone.
It really is, he had great chemistry with Tyrese and Ludacris.
Yea, he will be missed.
Definitely, without him I get a bit sad when watching the new films.
At least he has a legacy.
Yea, those original movies were great.
