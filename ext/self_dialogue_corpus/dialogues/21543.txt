What are some movies you like from the 90's?
Well, I really enjoyed Ten Things I hate About You.
That is a classic teen movie from the 90's.
Yeah, Heath Ledger was really good in it.
What else is he in?
He's in tons of things. But, one of his best movies from the 90's was The Patriot.
Oh, I have heard of that one.
Mel Gibson was in that one.
I am a huge Mel Gibson fan.
Speaking of Mel Gibson and the 90's did you see Braveheart?
Of course. It is one of my favorite movies.
Did you know Mel Gibson directed that one?
I had no idea. That is very cool.
It came out around 1996, when I was a kid.
What other movies do you like from the 90's?
Beauty and the Beast was awesome.
I agree. That was one of the best cartoons ever made.
There were many other good movies too. Independence Day was one of them.
I like that one. Will Smith was the king of the 90's action scene.
I agree. He is a fantastic actor too.
