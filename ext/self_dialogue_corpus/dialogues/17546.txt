Are you going the battle of the bands next weekend?
No.
Why not?
Never heard of any of the bands.
My brother's band is going to be there.
Oh, yeah? I didn't know he was a musician.
Yup.
What does he play?
The drums.
Which band?
This Awkward Moment.
What a great name.
I thought so.
What do they play?
Mostly covers.
Figures.
They mostly do heavier rock.
Well I might have to come out.
We could go together.
It's a plan!
