Hey, so what is the best movie of the year so far?
Tough question. I really liked Wonder Woman!
Shockingly, its up there for me too.
I was blown away.
Yeah, well DC has been a travesty up until this film
Another top level superhero film was Logan
I thought Logan was fine. Not crazy about it
Really? I thought it was the best X-men movie
It might be, X-2 is up there. I just lost interest once we had the monster party at the end
X-men sure love to come up with random mutants. Its weird
Yeah, I mean, Jackman is great and their relationship is sweet
So, what is your favorite?
Probably Get Out. It was masterful
I agree with that. So restrained, tight, and funny given the material
We knew that they were all bad, but thankfully their motivations was a crazy surprise
Totally nuts. Did you have a good crowd for that?
Nope. It was me, and like two other couples.
I had a packed audience that was into it!
Lucky. I've had bad crowds or dead ones
I'll happily take the latter. Sheesh
