Hey, what are you listening to?
Oh, I'm listening to daft punk.
Really? I never picked you to be a techno person.
Well I'm not into techno per sa I just enjoy all types of music. Now I'm listening to Bob Segar.
Oh ok. What about country? Do you like Toby Keith? Or Johnny Cash?
I love Johnny cash. Don't care too much for the newer rap country.
Really. I love colt Ford.
Jason Alden made some of his songs popular.
Yeah most people don't know that.
Yeah I heard that was the record label gave the song to Jason Aldean.
That seems right. All they care about is money. Not creativity.
Yeah. I like using pandora because it will take me to new music that haven't heard before.
Or a song you've never heard before by your favorite band.
What is your favorite band?
Hard to say but right now I'm really into the black keys.
What are some of thier songs?
Gold on the celing, little black submarines, and sister.
Oh yeah I've heard of gold on the celing before.
Yeah that was a popular song. First one that I heard by them.
I like it. It is very catchy.
