Let's discuss.....Nicki Minaj.
The queen of rap!
So many of her songs are so catchy.
Yes, I just love how she came on the music scene, to be honest.
What do you mean?
Basically, she entered the scene by being on EVERY song.
Like Bed Rock?
Bed Rock, My Chick Bad, Bottlez Up....
probably even more than that, wasn't she on the All I Do is Win remix too?
Yep, and she killed all her verses.
I like how she stands out even with a group of people, particularly men.
Agreed, have you heard No Frauds?
YES, I love the song. The beat, the features, the music video...perfection.
I like that it's a diss track too, it makes it so much better.
I didn't know that!
Yep, it's for Remy Ma.
Oh, yeah I heard of their feud. Well Nicki killed that song.
Agreed. I literally sing her verse from Monster all the time.
It's SUCH a classic Minaj verse.
And super catchy!
