Hey Joe, what are you listening to?
Oh, hey Mark, I'm listening to Def Leppard.
Def Leppard?  I've never heard of them.
What?  You've never heard of Def Leppard?  They've only been around for like 40 years!
Really?  Maybe I have heard them and just didn't know it.
Have you heard "Pour Some Sugar on Me?"
Oh yeah, I have.  Is that a Def Leppard song?
It sure is, Mark!  Here, listen to this song, "God's of War."
Oh, this has a nice beat.  The drummer is really good.
He only has one arm.
No way!  One arm?  How does he do it?
Well, when he lost his arm he started off using electronic drums and started to use his feet more, but now he uses a regular set.
Does he still use his feet a lot?
Yes, more than other drummers anyway.
That's cool, I am really enjoying this song.  Do they have a lot of albums?
They have quite a few.  I would recommend Hysteria and Pyromania.
Nice, I will have to check those out.
Good, you should.  I actually like all of their albums, including their latest one.
What's it called?
It's called Def Leppard, and it was released last year I think.
