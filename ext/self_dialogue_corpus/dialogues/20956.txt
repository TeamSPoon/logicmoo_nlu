Did you see Creed?
No I haven't yet.
One ot the best rocky movies done.
I've read that.
Stallone should have won an Oscar.
I watched the oscars. I think everyone was stunned he didn't.
Sly was ready to stand up to get the award I think.
That's what it looked like.
Honestly,his acting was tremendous.
I've got to see it.
I rented it On Demand.
I'll probably do the same.
I wish I went and saw it on the big screen though.
It's always better in the movies.
It's always more expensive too.
Haha,that's for sure.
Hard to find time to go to the movies for me.
Yea,me too. Especially with three grandchildren.
I'm sure they keep you busy.
Isn't that the truth.
