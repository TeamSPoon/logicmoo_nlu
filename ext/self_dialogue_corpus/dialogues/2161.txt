Who do you think is the greatest quarterback ever?
I think right now it's Tom Brady.
Do you think he's better than Joe Montana?
Brady has won more Super Bowls than Montana.
How many Super Bowls did Montana win?
Joe Montana won 4 Super Bowls.
How many has Brady won?
Tom has won 5.
What about Terry Bradshaw?
Terry Bradshaw won 4 Super Bowls.
I guess if we are only going by Super Bowls Tom Brady is the best.
Super Bowls seem to be the biggest factor.
I would still rather have Joe Montana.
Hey, I think Joe is great but you asked who is the greatest of all time.
I think Joe is better than Brady.
Why is that?
Joe just seemed to never lose his cool.
Well he was called 'Joe Cool'.
I do see your point with Brady winning 1 more Super Bowl.
Plus, Tom is still playing it could be more than 1 before he retires.
