Checked out the Beatles channel on Sirius?
I just did the other day.
I absolutely love it.
Me too. The Beatles are my favorite.
They changed music.
Yes they did.
Song after good song on their channel.
Yes and some deep cuts too.
Not just songs though.
Right. I hear interviews also.
Yes and some recent talks with Paul and Ringo.
Yea,there's some good stuff on there.
They also play songs from groups and musicians that influenced them.
I know. I've heard some Elvis and chuck berry songs.
Yes and also little Richard.
Paul,took his "oooo" from little Richard.
That's been his signature for awhile.
I love when he hits that high note.
He's still rocking,Paul.
Yes he is.
