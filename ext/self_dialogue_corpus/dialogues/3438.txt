Have you seen The Skeleton Key?
I don't think I have. What is it about?
It's about a nurse who goes to care for an eccentric family and it turns out that there are evil forces at work.
Who plays the nurse?
Kate Hudson plays her. She does a good job.
I usually enjoy Kate Hudson.
Me too. And the setting for the movie is really cool.
Where does it take place?
In the swamps of Louisiana. It adds an eerie feel to everything.
Oh that sounds amazing.
