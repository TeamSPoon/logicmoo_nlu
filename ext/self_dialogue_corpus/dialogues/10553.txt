Hey, I'm looking for a fun little comedy to watch. Do you have anything to recommend?
Actually yes. We just watched one last weekend.
What was it called?
Masterminds. It's with a bunch of very funny people like Zach Galifianakis, Kristen Wiig, and others.
Was it really funny or kinda dumb?
Both at the same time actually. It was really silly, but I laughed a lot.
It's not too crass in terms of humor?
No, not at all. It's not that kind of teenage humor oriented toward body parts.
Good, cause I get tired quickly of that.
No, it's really funny. It's about a naive and somewhat dumb Loomis employee who is convinced to steal a truckload of money (literally) by a work crush.
Classic heist movie, with a comedy treatment?
Something like that. But of course most of them are really dumb, or not too forward thinking at the very least.
Sounds like it could be fun. Anyone else that I know in that movie?
Jason Sudeikis plays the part of a hilarious Southern hitman.
I love Jason Sudeikis!
Well you'll love him in that because he's a riot. It's a character bit, and it's highly ridiculous, but he makes it work beautifully.
Oh wow - I'll watch it!
Otherwise, we watched Christmas office Party recently. But it wasn't as funny, although I kinda liked it.
Nah... We watched it and my girlfriend fell asleep after five minutes.
Yeah... my husband did the same.
