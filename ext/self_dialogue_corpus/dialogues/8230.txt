What's your favorite pop song that came out so far this year?
Oh, my current favorite has to be Closer by the Chainsmokers.
I have heard that song so much lately, but haven't gotten tired of it yet somehow.
Me neither. I've also heard a good amount of Lady Gaga on the radio.
Really? I didn't think she had come out with any new songs lately.
That's true. They are some of her older songs like Paparazzi and Bad Romance.
Oh, I see. I like those. My favorite that came out this year is probably the new Coldplay song.
I haven't heard that one yet actually.
It's a good one. It's a good crossover between rock and pop.
Yeah, Coldplay is really good at that.
