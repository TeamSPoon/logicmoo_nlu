What is your favorite Bruno Mars Song?
I really like Treasure! It was the best for me.
Did you know he is one of the few American musicians that are able to both play piano and sing at the same time?
Really?
Yeah I think the only others are John Legend and Alicia Keys!
Wow! He is really talented !
Yeah I think he even writes his own songs if I am not mistaken.
Wow!
I definitely have more respect for him as an artist now that I know about his talent.
