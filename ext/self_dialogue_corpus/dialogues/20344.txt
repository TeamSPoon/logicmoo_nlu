What is your favorite genre of movies?
I would have to say romantic comedies.
Me too! I love them because they tug at my heartstrings but are also funny and entertaining.
Same! They keep me laughing.
Do you have any favorites?
I really like Sweet Home Alabama. I just watched it the other day.
Oh me too! I love that movie. I love Reese Witherspoon. She does a lot of romantic comedies.
Yeah, she was in Legally Blonde.
Yeah! That movie is hilarious.
What romantic comedies do you like? Any favorites?
I think my favorite is How to Lose a Guy in 10 days.
Oh I think I have seen that one. Who is in that agian?
It is great. It has Kate Hudson in it.
Oh right! She is writing an article about what not to do in relationships right?
Yeah! That is the one!
That is a good romantic comedy. Good call.
Those are all somewhat older movies. They haven't made any new good romantic comedies in a while.
The last one I saw that was newer is Trainwreck.
Yeah that one is good and came out only a few years ago.
Yeah. Hopefully more come out soon. I love them.
