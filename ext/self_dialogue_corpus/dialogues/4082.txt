I want to go see 47 Meters Down soon, it came out recently.
What is that movie about?
It is about sisters that go on vacation, and decide to dive in a cage to see sharks.
And I am sure it doesn't go as planned!
Exactly, you guessed it!
Who plays in it?
Mandy Moore and Claire Holt are in it, Chris Johnson, and Matthew Modine as well.
How many stars did it get for reviews?
Three stars recently, but no higher.
I think I will wait for that one to come out on DVD.
