I watched The Half Blood Prince again yesterday.
Oh, I love that movie, it's the best one.
It's really good, but with Voldemort's rise, and Draco Malfoy's dark experiences, it gets darker.
I feel as though seeing Draco Malfoy sad and desperate, like after Harry attacks him in Moaning Myrtle's bathroom, makes him more relatable, not darker.
He still ends up following the Dark Lord though. He's just too scared to kill Snape in the end.
He regrets it though. He's so sad and stressed out after taking the Dark Mark. You just don't know it until the end of the movie.
It's still a choice though.
He and his parents were sort of forced into it with Voldemort's threats. And Lucius wasn't the greatest parent, letting him have whatever he wanted, even all those brooms.
I don't remember Voldemort specifically killing them, though.
He would though. Remember how his followers shamelessly murdered the Muggles on that bridge in the beginning of the movie?
