I have been getting into Taylor Swift stuff lately.
You know, she writes most of her own stuff.
I think she writes a lot for others as well.
She may have started country and went on to pop, but she is really a singer song writer.
Her song's are all really full and have a really good narrative.
Even her earlier stuff did.
Yes, like Love Story and Our Song.
She was just a teen when she made that one.
I think she is the best singer to come from the decade she did.
Yes, way better than people like Miley Cyrus or Katy Perry.
