Have you seen the new x-men movie?
Logan?
Yes, I think that's what it's called
No, but I really want to, have you?
I haven't either but I heard it's really good.
Me too, I'm waiting for it to come out in redbox.
Same, I don't want to buy pay per view
It's too expensive
Have you seen all the x-men moviez?
Yes I just saw apocalypse
That one was good, I like flashback movies like that
Me too, I like how it gives a deeper understanding to each ones character.
Exactly, like jean.
Who knew she was that powerful
Shes more powerful than any xmen, but she hides as a nurse.
I dont understand that
Maybe they were foretelling she will do something great.
That's possible
I hope so
Me too, she's my new favorite character.
