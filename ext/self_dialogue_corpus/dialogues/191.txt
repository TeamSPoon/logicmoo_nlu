What is your favorite Superhero movie?
I think it has to be Guardians of the Galaxy, you?
I'm a huge fan of The Dark Knight.
You're right, that was an amazing movie, especially the jokers parts.
Yeah, Heath Ledger was amazing in that role.
Do you think anyone will ever play a better joker than he did?
Absolutely not. he played it so good it killed him.
Too bad too, his movies were really good.
I agree, I especially like A Knights Tale.
What else has he done?
