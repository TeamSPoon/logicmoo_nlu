What do you think of 21 Pilots?
They're kind of stupid. That's kid music.
Maybe so. I have kids so I appreciate the fact that I can listen to music with them that sounds decent and contains clean content.
That guy thinks he's a rapper. He sucks.
Well, he started rapping because he writes long lyrics. It's the only way to get all the words in. I like the genre blending, personally. I don't think rappers need to hard or "authentic" in any way. It's just a music style.
No. Pick a style and stick with it. It sounds like to just want to appeal to everyone in order to make the most money.
That's so cynical. They started off as a small act. It is just a stroke of luck that they became popular.
I could write songs better than that. Pay me a million dollars and I will deliver better.
That's not how it works. No one is going to pay you a million dollars to write a song. How many 21 Pilots albums have you heard?
I heard that dumb song on the radio where they are whining because they don't to pay their bills.
That's your interpretation?! Again, that's such a cynical view! They have a couple of great albums. Maybe you should check them out.
Ok. I will do that.
Ha. I don't believe you, but that's totally okay. You do you. Their first album Vessel is really good.
Aren't they like Christian rock?
No. I guess they are Christian but the songs do not revolve around Christ worship. I am not religious at all and I like them a lot.
I don't want to listen to religious propaganda. Christian rock is lame.
Well, you are certainly entitled to your opinion on that, but I would not classify it as Christian rock.
I like gangster rap only.
Seriously? Oh. Well then you probably would not like 21 Pilots.
BINGO!
