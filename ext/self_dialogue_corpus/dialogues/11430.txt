Why did people burn Beatle records in the 1960s?
Because John Lennon had the famous qoute "More popular than Jesus" (or "bigger than Jesus"
People really got that offended by that?
Yes,Christian communities really got upset, and the Beatles even got death threats.
Did this factor in the Beatles decision to stop touring?
Yes, because they started to get bad publicity in such that their concerts no longer sold out.
I heard even the KKK got involved?
Yes, the KKK picketed some Beatles concerts.
If John never made that statement would they have continued to perform?
Who is to say? My guess is no. They boys were tired of the scrutity by the media, and it was time to for the studio route.
