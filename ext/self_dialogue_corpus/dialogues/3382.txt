Did you have a chance to see The Conjuring yet?
I just watched it last night on HBO.
Can you believe that it is based on a true story?
I know, creepy right?
When the mom started getting bruises on her, I was terrified.
That part was scary because it felt like ghosts could finally really hurt a person.
I jumped when the demon was on top of the bureau in the girls' room though.
Oh, that part made me scream out loud.  I woke up my dog!
It was great to finally see a movie that was scary without gore.
You are right, there wasn't the gross factor in this one.
