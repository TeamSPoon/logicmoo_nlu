Do you like country music?
I'm torn. I used to like country, but that was my parents' influence.
So, you don't like modern country?
Well, it depends on what constitutes modern country? I dislike the political overtones of many current artists.
I see.  Well, what artists have you enjoyed in this genre?
When I was very, very young, I loved Dolly Parton, Patsy Cline, Willie Nelson, and Lorretta Lynn. But, that was mom's influence.
What was your favorite Dolly Parton song?
I liked a few, actually.  9-5 was an anthem.  Hard Candy Christmas, Jolene,  Coat of Many Colors, and Islands In the Stream.
What about Willie Nelson?
Any song by Willie Nelson is great in my book.  I think he's a musical genius.
Didn't Patsy Cline die before you were born?
Oh, yeah!  She died in the early 60's.
So, how did you come to like her music?
Again, my mom liked her music and when the bio-pic of her life came out, we owned it on VHS.
Same with Loretta Lynn?
Yes.  Coal Miner's Daughter was on our mantle with the other movies.
Why do you think you no longer listen to country?
I don't know, exactly.  Don't get me wrong- Garth Brooks, Tim McGraw, Faith Hill,...all great songwriters.  I just have found other tastes, I guess.
I think most people do.
Country music has roots, deep roots, that will keep it around. At some point, I might enjoy it again.
