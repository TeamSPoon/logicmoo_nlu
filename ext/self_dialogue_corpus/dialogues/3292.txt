Do you have a favorite Stephen King movie?
In general, I think his movie adaptation are pretty awful.
I didn't think the Shining or Carrie were bad.
He does have some good ones, but then there are ones like Dreamcatcher.
In his defence, Dreamcatcher was a pretty wild book to start with.
yes, toilet weasels are pretty hard to make believable.
I think a lot of his stuff is hard to make into a movie because of all the stuff going on in people's heads.
His books are so long, too, that the really good ones are the ones where are there are lots.
You mean like the stand and IT?
Yes, exactly, with a longer scope, you can really explore the horrors of the story.
