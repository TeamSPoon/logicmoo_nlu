Are you going to the Bayside concert on Tuesday?
I'd really like to, but I don't have anyone to go with.
I'm going with a big group! Would you like to come with us?
I'd love to! Bayside is my favorite band, but I hate going to concerts alone.
I never knew you loved Bayside! Me too! What other bands do you like.
I really like Brand New. They're one of my favorites too.
Did you go to their concert with Modest Mouse last year?
I did! It was incredible. Both bands are so epic and put on a great show.
What's your favorite Brand New album?
Mine is Deja Entendu. What's yours?
I love The Devil and God Are Raging Inside of Me.
That's a great album. I have so many fond memories connected with that band.
I feel the same way about Brand New. And Alkaline Trio!
Oh man, I haven't listened to Alkaline Trio in ages. What are they doing?
They're on a little break right now because their lead singer Matt Skiba is on tour with Blink 182.
Oh I heard about that. Isn't it messed up how Tom Delonge quit the band?
Yeah, I was bummed to hear about it. But I think Skiba is a great substitute.
Me too. I prefer old school Blink 182 anyway.
Same here. All The Small Things is my favorite song.
Mine too!
