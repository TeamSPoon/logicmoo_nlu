So, you tell me you hate the NBA. Why?
Oh, a massive multitude of reasons. I'll tell you over the course of 9 turns.
Okay, that's weirdly specific, but go ahead.
The referees don't penalize flopping.
What's that?
When a guy gets lightly bumped on the shoulder and somehow manages to fall about 20 feet. They do it in soccer too, but not as dramatically.
Ha, LeBron is good at that.
Sadly, yes. And it's not punished. Sadly, you can't confirm or deny when someone is off-balance naturally or not.
How else do you hate the NBA?
They don't call traveling. The players pretty much can do whatever they want and it's all good.
And?
Even bigger, if a guy gets fouled, then throws a ball up and it goes in, it counts as it's part of the shot.
Yeah, it is.
No, it's not. Unless he's actively shooting with the ball over his head, he's NOT shooting.
What is it, then?
He's throwing up the ball AFTER the foul, and getting rewarded for it.
Ahh, yeah that's a bit annoying.
Plus, these guys make tens of millions acting like babies and being awful role models.
All for playing a game...
I wish I could be a professional Cards Against Humanity player. Same level of being a jerk, but no rules.
