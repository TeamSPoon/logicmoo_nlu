Did you hear who's being inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame this year?
No, who?
ELO, Joan Baez, Journey, Tupac Shakur, Yes, Nile Rodgers, and Pearl Jam.
Wow, that's a really wide variety of bands. The oldies, YES, to alternative superstars Pearl Jam, to rapper Tupac.
I'm glad Pearl Jam is being inducted, they have always been one of my favorite alternative rock bands.
People say Eddie Vedder is a nice guy too.
He has a really unique voice. I was lucky enough to see the band at an outside concert once, and his voice just floats through the air.
Where was the concert at?
Wisconsin. I drove past all these green lush fields, lots of cows, and then there was tents everywhere with concert goers and it looked like Woodstock or something.
Pearl Jam should have sang the song lyrics differently, instead of Yellow Ledbetter, they should have sung Yellow Ledbutter.
