What is your favorite Disney movie?
It's one that most people haven't seen.  My favorite is The Brave Little Toaster.
You're right, I haven't seen that.  What is it about?
It came out a while ago, back in the 80s I think.  Basically these appliances are trying to find their owner.
Sounds a little weird.  I'll have to check it out though.  You know another Disney movie I don't hear talked about? The Great Mouse Detective.
Oh yeah I've seen that one.  I remember liking it as a kid.
My favorite has always been The Fox and the Hound.
That one used to always make me cry when I was little.
Me too but the little fox and hound are so cute!
It was always really sad when the lady had to take the fox and leave him in the woods.
