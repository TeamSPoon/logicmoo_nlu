Who did you like to listen to in high school?
I was totally into the REM, U2, The Alarm, Hoodie Gurus. I loved that alternative rock.
Me too. Murmur was my favorite album then I listened it to all through college.
I was in to those bands earlier albums too. What else did you like?
Fine Young Cannibals. Hated them when they were hot then year or so later decided I like the album.
Did you listen to Natalie Mechant?
Love her. And Tracy Chapman. Indigo Girls.
I think we were on the same wave length.
Really? I also like Blood and Roses.
I remember them.
Did you like Echo and Bunnymen?
No not so much. I had a friend that was really in to Meatloaf if you can believe it!
No! For some reason I think there was a lot Eagles still being passed around.
Remember that song, "Seven Bridges Road"?
ugh! yeah...too many memories wailing that one!
Same friend was also in to Jimmy Buffet and James Taylor.
Bet you had some arguments over the tunes!
Yeah, but diversity is good. A little here and there isn't bad. I got in to finding soundtracks.
That's cool.
It was usually a decent mix of music and I didn't have to make a mixed tape.
