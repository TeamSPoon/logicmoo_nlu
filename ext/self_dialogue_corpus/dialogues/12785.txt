I think the prequels are superior to the original trilogy.
Eat your words.
No I mean seriously, the effects are far superior, better acting, directing, etc
Of course the special effects are better. We have CGI on much faster computers.
Even accounting for that, the imagination is so much more involved in the prequels than the original.
I don't even know what that even means. For its day, the original trilogy was pretty good in terms of the storyline and imaginative uses of so many things
Like what?
Light saber for instance. Who wold've imagined a sword made of light?
Now that you put it like that...
Yep. It was pretty innovative thinking.
