Hey man, why do you always root against the KC Royals.
It's only because I'm not a Royals fan. They aren't that good.
You know where you live right?
Yes I know. But since I live here doesn't mean I have to like them.
Sure... Whatever. Who is your team then?
I like the Detroit Tigers.
Oh really? They aren't that good either.
But in my case they are better than the Royals.
They play at Kaufman on the 29th of this month you down for going?
Of course. And I will wear my gear.
I think Justin Verlander is pitching.
I sure hope so . He's playing really good now. And I hear that he always plays good against the Royals. Might be an easy win.
Not if Eric Homer is playing. He's a guaranteed all star this year.
Eric is good but he isn't a Miggy (Miguel Cabrera)
I'm excited we will be able to talk trash as well as root for our teams.
I am too I haven't seen the Tigers play since I was a senior in high school.
Is Ian Kinsler back?
Yes I think he's back on the field and playing great.
Well this will be a good game. Let's go ahead and by the tickets soon.
Awesome I will look for some great deals.
