Are there any really good classic thriller movies?
Yes, I really liked Jaws
You mean the one made in 1975
yes that's the one, directed by Stephen Speilberg
I love his movies, I don't think he ever made a bad movie
I agree, I have seen plenty of his movies.
I will have to watch Jaws tonight
I think you will really enjoy it
I do like a good scare
There is plenty of jumpy moments in that film
