What did you think about the movie Sully?
The one about the airplane emergency landing on the lake?
Yes, with Tom Hanks.
It was so good. It had been a while since I had seen a movie with him.
He has done a few lately, but you defenitely watched the best one.
He is an exeptional actor. The movie was so tense though.
Yes, thinking that he was going to go to prison for acting like a hero was nerve wrecking.
Yeah. And the fact that it is a true story.
Sometimes real life is way more intense than fiction.
It is. You know I read a strange fact about Tom Hanks a couple of weeks ago on Twitter.
What is it?
That supposedly he is a distant cousin of Abraham Lincoln.
Wow, that's crazy. He will probably go into politics after ending his acting career.
Who knows? Maybe he'll follow Arnold Schwarzenegger's steps.
Yes, it would not be something new.
And according to what I read George Clooney is also related to Abraham Lincoln.
Maybe you and I are also related to him.
It's crazy right?
The world is a small place. But it is awesome to know that some amazing people are related.
Yes. I think Tom Hanks and Goerge Clooney both should do a movie about their distant cousin.
