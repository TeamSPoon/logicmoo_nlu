Who was your favorite character in toy story?
First movie, or the full franchise?
Any of them, mine was the army men, I always wanted to play with mine when I watched it.
I always like Mr. Potato-Head.
He was hilarious.
I loved seeing him get him and his pieces flew everywhere.
That and when he put himself together the wrong way.
Yeah, I loved it when he said, "I'm Picasso!"
It makes me laugh everytime
My favorite would have to be when his flap came open and he got embarrassed.
