Do you like World War two films?
Yes, I love them! Do you have a favorite?
Very cliche, but 'Saving Private Ryan'.
Cliche, but an amazing movie so it makes sense.
That opening scene is one of the most incredible things in cinematic history.
The Normandy beach scene? I remember when the movie came out, and everyone was discussing the accuracy of it.
I remember too, and I think it's still agreed to be the most accurate scene of the landing on film.
Which is utterly terrifying, when you think about it.
And of course, Tom Hanks does a great job as always.
Was it directed by Speilberg?
Yes, it was. He did 'Schindler's List', too.
I thought so. I studied 'Schindler's List' in college.
Oh, really? Is that your favorite WW2 film?
I'm not sure if I could pick a favorite, but I do love 'Schindler's List'.
I've seen it so many times, and the very last scene still makes my eyes tear up.
Steven Spielberg really knows how to tell WW2 stories with grace and honesty.
Yes, he does. I'm guessing you've seen 'Band of Brothers'?
Of course! Anyone who is a Spielberg or WW2 movie fan should see it. Unbelievable.
I haven't seen 'The Pacific', but I want to. Have you seen it?
Yes I have, and it's every bit as good as 'Saving Private Ryan' or 'Schindler's List'.
