So, who is your favorite NFL team and why?
I've always liked the Minnesota Vikings for some reason, starting when Fran Tarkenton was the QB.
So, how do you think they will do this year?
I think they will win like 10 games and win their division.
Why do you think the Vikings will win 10 games?
Well, they have a good QB, Sam Bradford, signed two new offensive lineman in the offseason, and drafted a center from Ohio State in the 3rd round of college draft.
So, who do they play in their fist game?
They play the New Orleans Saints on Monday Night football
So, who do you think is the best team in their league?
I think the Atlanta Falcons would have to be s favorite to go to the Super Bowl again.
Yeah, Matt Ryan is a great QB. So, who do think is the best QB?
I don't like Green Bay, but I always hate facing Aaron Rodgers with his rocket arm
Which NFL team has the best defense?
I think it's usually like these two teams, Seattle and Baltimore.
So, who do think will play Atlanta in the next Super Bowl
Unfortunately, you have to choose Bill Belichick and the New England patriots.
So, why did you say ' unfortunately '?
Because I'm tired of the same teams winning every year. Let a team like the Browns sneak in lol
Finally, who is your favorite NFL player of all time?
My favorite NFL player to ever watch was Fran Tarkenton of the Vikings many years ago.He was very exciting and could both scramble and throw, way before a Johnny Manzell arrived.
