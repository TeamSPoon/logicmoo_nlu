Do you like to watch any black and white movies?
Sometimes, though a lot of them seem boring to me.
Do you know anything about the first movie ever made?
No, do you want to talk about it?
Yes! It's actually one of my favorite movies.
What is it called.
It's called Nosferatu, and it's pretty much Dracula.
Oh I haven't heard of that as a movie, but I know of the monster.
Oddly enough, the movie was pretty enjoyable to watch, even by today's standards.
Really? That's very interesting.
It is a silent movie though, so there aren't any voices.
That I would expect if it's so old.
They do have lots of music though and still have the word panels that show up.
I'm not really much for those.
You should watch it sometime though, it's not boring at all.
I might, do you know where I could watch it.
I'm sure you could rent it online somewhere, maybe through Netflix.
That's a good idea, though I'll wait a while to watch it.
Nah you have to watch it with me sometime soon, it's really good.
I guess I'll give it a try when I come over next.
