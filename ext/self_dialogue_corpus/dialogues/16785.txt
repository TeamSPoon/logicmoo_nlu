How was the concert last night?
It was awesome. Journey really did well with their new singer.
New singer? It's not Steve Perry any more?
Nah.  Hasn't been for a while now. They got a new guy, Arnel Pineda.
How does he sound?
It's incredible, He sounds exactly like Steve Perry.
That's incredible! Are they doing the Perry songs?
Yep.  And it's funny. In an interview, Arnel told the reporters that he had been singing for nearly his entire life, and was pitching his voice to sound like Steve Perry.
That's very cool.  By the way, are you going to see Nightwish? They're coming to town next month.
I've never heard of them.  What kind of music do they have?
I think the best description is Symphonic Metal.  They have a soprano as the lead singer, and have had different ones over time.
That's unusual.  It sounds pretty good though.
It is.  The current one, Floor, has a really rich voice, and you can tell that she has been professionally trained.
I may have to go then.  I like unusual combinations in music.
Like the Cellists who perform metal on their cellos?
Apocalyptica? Yeah, they're pretty fun.
I like their cover of Nothing Else Matters.  It's haunting.
My favorite is Hall of the Mountain King, but you know that I'm a sucker for classical music, too.
Yeah, that's why I had you check out Bond.  Are you going to get their latest album?
Already did and it's on endless repeat in my car.
