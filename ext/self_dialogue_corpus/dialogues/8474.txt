Do you think Michael Jackson is the king of pop?
Yes, he's sold more records than almost anyone.
He did have some great songs.
His album thriller is an all time great.
Is that the one with Billie Jean?
Yeah that was on there.
Billie Jean is one of my favorite songs.
It's a great song.
I wish he didn't go crazy towards the end of his life.
It did diminish his greatness.
