Have you watched the Martian?
That's the Matt Damon movie right where he's stuck on Mars?
Yeah I loved it. Watched it last week.
I liked how Ridley Scott the director infused some humor in there to keep it not so dark and bleek.
I think it was both Matt Damon's idea as well as Ridley's. I don't think there's a Matt Damon movie where he doesn't display his personality.
Speaking of Matt Damon what's your favorite movie of his?
I think my favorite Matt Damon movie is the Bourne series.
Really? I think he's okay in there but there are so many other movies that Matt's done that I think are better.
Which movies do you like more? Don't tell me We Bought a Zoo.
Hey, We Bought a Zoo was a very fun family movie!
I know, I'm just kidding about it, I have to admit I enjoyed We Bought a Zoo too.
I think my favorite Matt Damon movie is probably the Adjustment Bureau.
Okay, I have to agree I really like that too. Having Emily Blunt in that movie bumped it up a notch for me too in regards to Matt Damon movie.
That doesn't surprise me. I know how much of an Emily Blunt fan boy you are.
How can you blame me? Since her performance with Tom Cruise in Edge of Tomorrow, she won me over. Then she followed it up with Sicario!
You're leaving out her performance from Into the Woods.
Alright, I didn't enjoy Into the Woods too much. I didn't realize it was more of a musical.
It wasn't that bad plus you had a fantastic cast in that movie, with Anna Kendrick, Meryl Streep, Johnny Depp, James Corden.
I know, it was subjective to me, I don't really watch musicals too much or enjoy them, so I had no idea Into the Woods was a musical.
I bet your mind would of changed if Matt Damon was in that movie!
