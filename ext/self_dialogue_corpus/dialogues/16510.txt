Do you have my copy of Gym Class Heroes?
Which cd?
The Papercut Chronicles.
Oh yeah, I do have that.
Dude, I've been looking for that for ages!
I'm sorry man, I totally forgot about it until you brought it up.
Its all good, just bring it the next time we hang out.
I totally will.
I wonder what Travis McCoy is up to lately?
I'm not sure, I haven't seen or heard anything about him in a while.
Me either.
Its a shame, I feel like the whole Katy Perry thing was like a curse to him.
A curse? Really?
Well, I'm only half serious, but you can't deny as soon as she hit it big, he faded out of the scene.
Well, not until after they broke up.
True. I'm sure everything was good when both their albums were popular.
That's right, I remember seeing them at a few reward shows.
Yup, and then she started getting really popular...
Maybe he was insecure that her albums were doing better than his.
Maybe. I imagine that'd be a low blow for a musical couple.
