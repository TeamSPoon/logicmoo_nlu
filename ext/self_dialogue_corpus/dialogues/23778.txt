Do you know anything about mumblecore movies?
Surprisingly, a bit.
I just started dating a girl who told me that her favorite genre is mumblecore. What do you know?
Have you heard of Hannah Takes the Stairs?
Nope. Is that a mumblecore film?
Yeah, it's one of the most famous. It's by a director called Joe Swanberg, he's widely credited as one of the originators of mumblecore.
Any other directors I might know?
You might have heard of the Duplass Brothers. Mark Duplass was on the television show The League and Jay Duplass is on Transparent.
Yeah, I know both of them actually, but not their movies! What did they make?
They've made quite a few movies. The Puffy Chair, Baghead, Cyrus, Jeff Who Lives at Home, Creep, The Do-Deca-Pentathlon.
Wow, that is a lot of stuff. Which is your favorite?
Cyrus is probably my favorite, but The Puffy Chair, their first feature length is my second favorite and probably the most emblematic of mumblecore.
What exactly is mumblecore then?
It's a lo-fi style of movie production, usually recorded very cheaply, sometimes with a shaky camera.
Why not just call it lo-fi?
Well there are other elements to it. The characters have a script, but there's a bit of improv.
I see, what else?
The filmmakers are trying to capture raw human emotion and what is essential in relationships rather than load a movie up with special effects.
I like the sound of this. Maybe this girl is for me.
She might be. You should definitely watch The Puffy Chair.
