Do you listen to a lot of soundtracks?
Yes, I especially love musicals.
Like Grease?
Yes!  I love the Grease soundtrack!
I think the only musical soundtrack I've ever listened to was Rocky Horror Picture Show.
Oh really?  There are a lot of other musical soundtracks you should get into.
I can't think of any.
Well, there's Little Shop of Horrors, Wicked, and Hairspray to name a few.
I've seen the movie Little Shop of Horrors!
See, you have one foot already in the door.  A lot of this stuff is on Spotify!
I will have to search it out!
I bet there's even a playlist on there that has a lot of musicals in it.  You could start there.
Do you like regular movie soundtracks?
Yes, I like Titanic!
Are you a big Celine Dion fan?
Not really, but I can't deny that she has a great voice.
I can agree with that.
She sings with her whole body, I think.
Yes, including chest poundings!
She's a great entertainer for sure.
