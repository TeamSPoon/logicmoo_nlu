Talking about quarterbacks was so much fun, let's discuss running backs.  I say a name, you tell me what you think of them.
Awesome!
David Johnson
The best all around back in the league.  He'll get 1,000 yards rushing and receiving this year and 23 touchdowns.
Leveon Bell
Very talented back, but gets injured all the time.  I predict he gets hurt after eight games this year.
Ezekiel Elliott
The best young back in the league.  Running behind that offensive line, he'll easily get 1,500 yards this year
Lesean McCoy
Overrated back.  Runs and catches well but not very physical.
Melvin Gordon
Fourth best back in the league.  Good overall back who will have 1,300 yards and 12 touchdowns this year
Adrian Peterson
One of the greatest backs to ever play in the NFL.  He's lost a step or two, I predict he only plays two more years.
Jay Ajayi
A talented back who is just figuring out the position.  Tough runner who is hard to bring down.
Todd Gurley
I think Gurley comes back this year and has a solid year.  The Rams upgraded their line which will reflect in his stats.
Marshawn Lynch
One of the greatest physical runners in his prime.  He took a year off, but he should have a solid year.  He's running behind the best line in the league.
