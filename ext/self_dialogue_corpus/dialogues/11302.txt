Do you ever listen to the beatles
No, i'm not much of a fan
Really? why?
Well I'm a fan of Elvis Presley, and its hard to be a fan of both
Are they rivals
Yeah they were pretty big rivals in the music industry
Well have you heard any of their music?
Yeah well I listened to Hey jude and it was a little bit boring
What! That song is a legend!
It just didn't do much for me
