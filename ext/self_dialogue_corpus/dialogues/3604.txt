Have you ever seen Night of the Living Dead?
The original black and white film?
Yeah, so you've seen it?
Sure, I love that one!
Me too!  What do you love most about it?
I don't know.  The whole movie is actually tense and has a sense of fear.
It's actually scarier than some of the zombie movies today.
You are right about that.
Have you seen any of the sequels?
Sure, but none of them match up to the originals.
