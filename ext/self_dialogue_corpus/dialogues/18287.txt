Lets start a new pandora station
Ok, what are you thinking?
I think something for when we sit by the fire, something chill
How about life house?
Oh I love them so much, thats a great suggestion
Colby Calliat would be great as well, both have such soft voices
Yes, she is wonderful, whats your favorite besides "Happy"
falling for you and bubbly would be my favorites
Do you like coldplay?
Oh yeah, I always forget about them, thats a wonderful suggestion.
Cold play always lifts my spirits
Natasha bedingfield is a lot like colby
Love her, she is gorgeous as well
Hey did you know natasha and lifehouse have a duet?
No kidding?

I would love to hear it
I have it on youtube, I will show you the video
Wow, that was simply amazing
I agree
