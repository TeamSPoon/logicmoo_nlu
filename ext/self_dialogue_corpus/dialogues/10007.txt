Have you ever seen John Wick?
No, but I';ve heard some about it. What's the plot?
John is a former assassin for the Russian mob, who left the life to marry the woman he loved.
So what happens to make go all killer elite again?
Less than week after his wife dies, the idiot son of his former boss, invades his home, beats him, kills his dog, and steals his car.
That wasn't a smart move, wasn't it?
No, John was a legend in the underworld and the Russian's called him Baba Yaga, or the Boogeyman
So, the kid is out of luck and time?
Yep, John can kill anybody the send and get past anybody they have try to protect the little putz.
Okay, now I defintely want to see this movie.
