What are your thoughts on Obi-Wan Kenobi in the prequels?
Ewan McGregor? He's a good actor but he's no Alec Guiness.
I love Alec Guiness!  Have you seen him in The Detective, as Father Brown?
Yes!  That's a great film.  I agree, he's great at Obi-Wan.
I don't think McGregor did a bad job, though.  He is a really good actor.
But, he didn't add the element of humor that Alec Guiness does.
I know what you mean. Like in a New Hope when he says, Obi-Wan isn't dead because I am Obi-Wan.
I have a theory that Rey is his grand daughter.
That would be a lot better than the predictable answer of her being Luke or Leia's child.
Well, the Skywalkers do like to abandon their children, so who knows!
