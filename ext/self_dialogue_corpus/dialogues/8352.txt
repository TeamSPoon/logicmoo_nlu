Ariana Grande resumed her tour after briefly suspending it following the Manchester attacks, but it had to be scary going to her first gig back.
I'm sure anyone would be nervous, but I think they picked her show because of opportunity, not because of her.
Her next show back though was Paris- and Paris has had a LOT of terrorism incidents, including a concert where a lot more people died than the Manchester concert.
Yeah, I'm not sure I'd want to be a pop singer on tour right now, there's been so many incidents.
The authorities all say don't let them take away your freedom, and continue your normal lives, but that's hard to do if you think you might be in danger.
Well, Ariana Grande did have the big Manchester benefit concert and security was tight, but everything went fine.
They said security would be heavy for the Paris show too of course, becuase of the potential for an incident.
The fans are really brave to keep going out to things instead of laying low at home.
I'm sure overseas fans feel like they don't know when they would get a chance to see her again, so that's why they risk it.
They must be really devoted Ariana Grande fans to take the risk though.
