I'm so confused.  Who was Han Solo's dad?
Huh?  What are you talking about.
Who was his dad?  They never say in any movies.
Why does that matter?  I don't get what you're trying to get at.
It would be great to know his backstory.  They focused on everyone else's.
There's a movie coming out next year talking about his origin.
Oh really?  Okay, that's good to know.
I think it's even called Han Solo just so you know it's about him.
Oh sweet.  When is that coming out?
May I believe.  Should be pretty cool!
