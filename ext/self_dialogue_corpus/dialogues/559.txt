No one cares about the Rams. Every team they've played has been mediocre.com
There couldn't be a team I dislike more.
Where was all this live when they were in St Louis.
Where's the love. You guys are bunch of hypocrites.
The Rams have ruined Sunday night football.
They have almost ruined all of football.
I've only seen three games this season. They've left such a bad taste in my mouth.
You literally haven't missed anything. The Rams are just an embarassment.
Have you caught any of the St Louis games.
Oh, I've seen all of the St Louis Games.
They started 3-1. At least they were competitive.
That means now they're going to go on a loosing streak.
They put together a team they knew would be garbage.
It's like the new coach is being set up to fail.
Either than or they trying to makes sure the team doesn't sale.
Who's their starting quarterback for Sunday.
Apparently they rotate. I'vee seen a new started for 3 games straight.
How on earthy do they strategize by rotating starters?
It's got them their 3 wins so far.
Yeah, but you can't think that's good long term.
