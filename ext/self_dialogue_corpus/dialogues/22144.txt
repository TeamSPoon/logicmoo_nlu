Do you think Step Brothers is the most quotable comedy of all time?
If it isn't it's definitely up there with them.
Right, it has a dumb quote that you can fit into so many situations.
I find the same thing to be the case with movies like Airplane.
Yeah even if it isn't totally relevant to the conversation, they're so quotable.
That's the thing comedies compared to other movies, quotable.
But then you get stuff like The Wicker Man, serious movies that become comedies.
I think you and I have quoted The Wicker Man more times than we've spoken normal words.
That and Kung Pow, Kung Pow might actually be the most quotable movie of all time.
Yeah I think we have to take that crown away from Step Brothers.
The sheer genius that is Kung Pow knows no bounds.
It's a shame we never got a sequel but maybe it's for the best.
Yeah I think it's something that is a flash in the pan, don't attempt it again.
Yeah don't want to ruin the legacy of the first one's greatness.
Look what happened with Anchorman 2, good but nowhere near as good.
You're right, comedy sequels don't tend to stick the landing.
Unless you're 21 Jump Street.
Yeah 22 Jump Street was actually a really good sequel.
But for every one of those you get Caddyshack 2.
I thought we agreed never to speak of Caddyshack 2.
