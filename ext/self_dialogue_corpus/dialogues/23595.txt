Would you be willing to watch a movie with me?
What movie do you have in mind?
Well I've been thinking about watching Raging Bull again.
Never heard of it, what's it about?
It outlines the life of boxing great Jake Lamotta
So like Rocky in real life?
It's funny that you mention Rocky as both films won best picture and are often compared, would say this is more gritty. Lamotta didn't have the easiest of lives.
Hmm interesting will need to look it up, but would likely be interested,  who directed it?
The great Martin Scorsese
Oh wow then I have little doubt it will be good.
Yeah it's great and the acting is superb.
Who stars in it?
Robert De niro has the main role and is great as always, Joe Pesci is remarkable as well.
Sounds like a great cast, look forward to it.
Yeah some of the better actors of our generation and a world class director.
Where would you rank it among Martin's films?
It's actually my favorite.
Wow and that's saying something.
He typically always delivers,  but the direction of this is on a whole other level, I am of course a boxing fan, so perhaps biased.
You do love your boxing! Get back to me soon and we can make this work.
