Did you hear that the Chargers are moving to Los Angeles?
Yeah, that's really crazy. It must suck for San Diego fans.
Yeah. I don't even know why Los Angeles would need two teams.
It's one of the biggest cities in America. You don't think they can handle two professional NFL teams?
I don't think so. I just don't really see LA being that big of a football city.
Well, they did have the Rams and Raiders before.
Yeah, and look what happened. Both teams moved out of the city.
You think that could happen again in the future?
Yeah, definitely. I think LA fans get bored of football and would rather watch baseball or basketball.
Maybe the franchises see a new popularity for footbball in the city. That's why they relocating there.
I heard that the ticket sales for the Rams first season in LA didn't really go that well.
Maybe it was because they weren't very good.
Maybe. But you would think, if there was a strong need for football, the fans would support a new team there regardless.
I think that people need to give it a few years before they determine that the poor ticket sales are going to be a constant thing for the Rams.
I just see it being a disaster. And with the Charger moving there, it's going to be even worse.
I do wonder how the fans are going to decide which team to be a fan of.
Probably going to depend on which team is better. I just feel bad for San Diego fans.
Yeah, must be horrible to realize that your team is moving away after decades of support.
That's why I can't stand sports sometimes. No loyalty.
Making money sometimes isn't about loyalty.
