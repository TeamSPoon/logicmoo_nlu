Which lightsaber is your favorite?
The green one.
No, silly. Like, which specialty lightsaber?
Can you give options so I know what you're talking about?
Sure: double-sided blade from Maul, curved from Dooku, etc.
I like the Purple Saber of Darth Sidious.
That's not who has it.
What??
Are you even a Star Wars fan? The purple blade is Mace Windu.
Yeah, I don't really pay attention, sorry. they're fun to watch, though!
