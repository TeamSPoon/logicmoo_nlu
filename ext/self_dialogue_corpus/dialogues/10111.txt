Have you seen the latest Wonder Woman movie?
Yes, I saw it over the weekend with my husband. We both loved it. Have you?
Yes, I went last week. I thought it was one of the best super hero movies I have seen in a while.
I agree, great casting with the two leads in particular. I love Chris Pine.
Me too. I wish his character wasn't killed off. But he did a fantastic job.
I know. I think it had some of the best fight scenes I had seen in a while. I love how strong and able the women were.
Me too. It was great to see Robin Wright to so well. She was incredible and the lead was outstanding.
I have never seen her in anything other than the Batman V. Superman movie where she played Wonder Woman.
I saw her in that too. She did not catch my attention as much, but I remember she was good.
She was, but this was by far a more demanding movie. What a fantastic role model for young girls. She is so capable.
