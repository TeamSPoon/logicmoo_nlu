I can't wait to see the new Guardians of the Galaxy movie.
I haven't heard much about the second one.
Really?! Have you seen a trailer?
No, I haven't. Does it look good?
It does! The scenes with baby Groot are adorable.
Groot and Drax were my favorite characters.
Yeah, Groot was my favorite as well.
It's funny that my favorite Vin Diesel role of all time is just his voice character.
You know, I completely forgot Vin Diesel was Groots voice!
I know! It's funny that an action star is in a superhero movie as just a voice.
This one has a lot of new actors. I love Kurt Russell as Ego.
I still don't understand the whole Ego character yet. How is a planet a father?
Well, you haven't seen it yet. I don't want to ruin it for you.
Yeah, I hate spoilers.
Maybe we could go see it together?
You want to see it again?
With you? I would see anything twice.
You are just too sweet.
But also, it's a great movie so it won't be a hardship.
Ha! Let's see it then.
