Who is your favorite actress?
I would have to say Nicole Kidman.
I like her as well. I watched a great thriller with her in it the other day.
Really? Do you remember the name of it?
Yes it was called Before I Go To Sleep.
I have been wanting to see that one!
It was really good. I think you would enjoy it.
I also like her co-star in that movie as well.
I did not recognize anyone else in it.
Yes, Colin Firth also plays in it with her.
