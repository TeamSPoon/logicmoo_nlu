You've seen Star Wars right?
Yes of course one of my favorite set of movies.
Good have a question for you.
Go ahead.
Do you think Luke and Lea could have been happy if Luke was never a Jedi or had any powers to begin with?
That's a hard question in short yes and no.
Why do you think that?
Yes because what drew them apart was Luke and his power rage if you will.
Now why no?
What also drew them together was Luke and that he was a Jedi they would never have even met if it wasn't for that.
