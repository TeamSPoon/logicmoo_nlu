I just showed Mary Poppins to my kids for the first time the other day.
How did they like it?
They really enjoy the parts with the songs, especially "A Spoonful of Sugar."
I can see that. What kid wouldn't like to be able to clean up a mess with a snap?
That would be amazing! And Julie Andrews is such an amazing actress.
Also, Dick Van Dyke is awesome as Bert.
Have you heard about the sequel coming out?
Yes, I am so excited because Lin-Manuel Miranda will be in it!
I saw some pictures online from the production. It seems like his role will be kind of like Bert in the original.
Yes, except I think he is a street lamp lighter instead of a chimney sweep.
