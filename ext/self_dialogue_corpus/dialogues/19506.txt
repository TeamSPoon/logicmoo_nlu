I just learned Beyonce was influenced musically by Motown's Diana Ross and the Supremes.
Everybody knew that! Did you know that the king of pop Michael Jackson was inspired by James Brown?
Just when you think you know all about music some new information shows up.
It's not new. The Beatles were influenced by a lot of Motown's musical acts.
I heard Paul McCarthy was inspired by Chuck what's his name?
Berry, who recorded "Johnny Be Good." You know who else inspired Paul?
Who? Based on his age it had to be someone from the 1950s.
Little Richard. The fifties Rock and Roll icon that had a big hit with "Good Golly Miss Molly."
He made "Lucille" too didn't he?
Yes and its still considered a Rock and Roll Classic today.
I read that Mick Jagger of the Rolling Stones loved Little Richard's music.
Did you know Black artists of  the 1950s couldn't use their pictures on their album covers?
Yeah and I heard a lot radio Djs wouldn't play their music either.
Back then you had to pay the Dj to play your records on the air.
I wonder how did musical acts survive back then?
Nowadays all you have to do is post videos on YouTube and pray people like your music.
Hey don't knock it. That's how Justin Beiber and many others got their start in the music business.
I wonder are those artists from the 1950s still getting royalty checks?
If they were being cheated then they are probably being cheated today.
That's sad. I believe there is enough money in the music business for everybody.
