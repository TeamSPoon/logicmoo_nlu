Where do you think the new Infinity Wars will take place?
I think the same setting as always.
Do you think it will travel to Thor's planets?
No his character isnt that important.
How long do you think it will be.
It has to be about 4 hours.
Thats too long for a movie.
I agree audiences dont want that.
But it could be close to three and a half.
They have to pack so many different characters in it.
