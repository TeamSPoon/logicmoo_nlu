Let's talk about music and movies.
I'd rather talk about music in movies.
Ok. What do you got?
Have you noticed that movie soundtracks rarely have anything to do with the movie, or that the song playing never has anything to do with the scene?
Everyone has. But, since you brought it up, how about an example?
So the trailer for Guardians of the Galaxy uses that "Fox on the Run" song by Sweet.
Yep, I really have fond thoughts about that song. It really brings me back to when I was 7. Let's sing it....
Let's not. So the song is playing in the scene when the Dumpster Panda is trying to get Baby Groot not to push the wrong button.
So what?
Well, it just doesn't make any sense. First of all, Dumpster Panda is some sort of demented raccoon and not a fox. And it's not running from anything noway.
The tree thing was running.
Well, maybe the song should be dubbed to "Baby Groot Be Runnin."
You're an idiot. The song has nothing to do with a fox. It's kind of about a girl who is past her prime, not that I'd ever say any woman was passed her prime because women only get better as they age, or so I think.
Oh, of course. I agree completely. Sweet existed during a time when it was proper to make sexist and lewd comments at the expense of women. I'm glad those times are over, even if it meant the death of rock & roll.
So we are agreed? Women are ok in our book. I mean, after all, our mothers are women. And frankly, so are our sisters. I don't want to insult them. And most of the women on the planet are women as well.
Absolutely.
So what was the point of all this?
I kind of lost track, but I think it was that the movie soundtracks are arbitrary and the songs are only used to generate additional sales. And probably most of them are already in the public domain so they don't cost the producers nothin' to use.
Right. So someone picked up the rights to the Sweet song for cheap.
Exactly. And women are cool.
