What did you think of the new Whitechapel album?
I really didn't like it. It sounds too much like their last two.
I'm glad I'm not alone on that one.
It's a shame that they're starting to get so repetitive so soon.
I know. They finally made themselves unique from every other deathcore band, but they made it get old really quick.
It was such a pleasant surprise on their self-titled album.
That one's still my favorite of theirs. Even if it set the tone for their last two bad albums, it still did it far better than they did.
Mine is probably This is Exile.
That one's a deathcore classic.
Exactly why I like it. I know that deathcore is considered a fad by a lot of metal fans, but it's one of my favorite styles because of this album.
That kind of makes me sad, because when Whitechapel first came on the scene, they were so much heavier than other bands.
I agree. Phil Bozeman's vocals beat out just about anyone else.
Even Suicide Silence didn't sound as heavy as they did.
As boring as the new Whitechapel was, though, it was still far better than the new Suicide Silence.
Oh man. I hated that album.
Same here, but I didn't hate it because of the sound change.
Me either. I hated it because they just didn't do it well at all.
I was just about to say that. I had to listen to old school Korn just to remind myself who did that style better.
That's kind of funny, but sad at the same time.
All too true.
