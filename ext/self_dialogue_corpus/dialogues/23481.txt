Did you ever watch the movie Con Air?
Yes, with Nick Cage. Great movie.
It was on last night. Couldn't help but watch it again.
There are so many good actors in that.
John Cusack is good. I like his movies.
Me too.
The soundtrack for the movie was awesome too.
A lot of good popular songs were in it.
That slow one at the end was always on the radio.
Was that called How Do I Live Without You?
I think so.
It was cute how he just kept hanging on to that stuffed animal for his daughter.
It was. A big tough guy with a toy.
You knew something wrong was going to happen right from the beginning.
Something always does to the good guys.
I didn't like the guy who was in charge of one of the bureaus.
Who was that?
The one that Cusack stole his car.
Yes, the guy with the curly hair.
I don't know his name.
