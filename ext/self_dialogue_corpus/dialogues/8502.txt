Man, do I hate Justin Bieber?
Doesn't everyone?
Of course not.  There's a whole slew of Beliebiers out there.
I don't get why.  He's not a good role model.
To say the least.  He's a punk.
And his music is not that good.  It's all helped by a machine.
Was he really that talented or just a Youtube sensation?
He wasn't better than anyone else on Youtube, but he looked good and that's all that mattered.
I wish I was talented.
And good looking - burn!
