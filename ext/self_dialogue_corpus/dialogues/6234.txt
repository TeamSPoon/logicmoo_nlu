I was going through old VHS movies and found so many Disney movies.
I have so many too. No one watches them.
We have one VCR yet. I was going to put Air Bud in.
Is that the movie about the dog?
Yes. The dog that plays basketball.
That was cute.
I forgot about it. My son used to love the movie.
Mine too.
Disney comes up with some cute ideas for movies.
They do. I wonder how they train the animals?
