What is your favorite rap song?
Oh that's easy, its Regulate by Warren G and Nate Dogg
Which one is that?
Oh its the one about two guys out for the evening - it has everything, ladies, armed robbery, car breakdowns, murder
Woah, thats a lot of stuff
Did those guy have any other hits?
Nope, not as far as I know.
Which, is kind of ok with me, I think listening to their other songs would ruin it for me.
Do they ever tour?
No, one of them died a few years ago - I cant remember which one.
