Did you hear DJ Khaled just put out an album?
No, I didn't. What is it called?
The album is called 'Grateful.'
Is it any good? I didn't even realize he made albums.
Well, it's mostly just a bunch of tracks of featured guests. It's not really like he writes his own music or anything.
Who are the other artists on it?
He has songs featuring Rihanna, Chance the Rapper, Nicki Minaj, Justin Bieber, and Future, among others.
Wow. That's quite an impressive list of artists.
Yeah. The album isn't getting very good reviews though.
Well that doesn't really surprise me either.
I'm not even sure how I would classify DJ Khaled as an artist.
He's certainly carved out a very interesting niche for himself.
Right? He basically just shouts slogans like "major key" while other artists do all the singing and rapping.
He's sort of like Lil Jon for a new generation.
That's so funny! He really is.
His snapchat is hilarious too.
That's true. He may not be a talented musician but he's definitely an entertainer.
Is this his first album?
No, apparently it's actually his tenth album.
Wow. Well you learn something new every day!
