When was the best era of disney movies?
I would say the very beginning, around the 30's and 40's, was the best.
For example? Which movies.
I think Pinocchio is a classic!
It's so boring though
Nonsense, for the time it came out, the animation is amazing. And the morals are good as well.
But the 90's movies were better.
What 90's movie can be better than Pinocchio?
Beauty and the Beast is so much better.
Well that's your opinion
