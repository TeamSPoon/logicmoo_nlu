When i was at the movie theater the other day I saw a trailer for a new Disney movie called Coco. It looks interesting.
I haven't seen any trailers yet. what is it about?
Its about this boy that learns to play guitar by watching old movies of a famous singer and guitar player.
Oh yes, that is interesting.
He later goes to where the man is burried and holds his guitar that is on display, and then something happens...
What happens?
I don't know if he turns into a ghost or he just starts seeing dead people. That happens to his dog too.  It's kind of confusing.
I'm intrigued. So what happens next?
He finds like a secret town. And then the trailer ends. Its' coming out Thanksgiving weekend of this year.
It's vague but interesting at the same time. Will definitely have to see it.
