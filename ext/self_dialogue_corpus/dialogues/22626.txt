Do you like the Harry Potter movies?
I actually never saw them.
Are you serious?
Yeah, I just never got into them.
Have you ever read the books?
Nope, I've never read them either.
That's crazy.  Everyone has.
Everyone, but me.
Have you ever seen part of it?
I saw part of the firtst one.
What do you remember?
All I remember was the owl and a closet.
You don't even remember anything good?
Honestly though, I do remember meaning to watch it.
So, you did want to watch it?
Well, the colors and the scenery were so bright and vibrant.
They actually were.  It was like a different world.
I just never had time.
You should take the time to watch it.
I might just do that.
