What is your favorite Disney Movie?
I really like the Lion King.
I grew up watching Disney. That is one of my favorites.
My boyfriend hates that I sing all of the songs.
I used to cry when mufasa died.
Me too. I was so little when I first saw it.
Me too! Only 5 when it came out.
Probably bugged my mom from watching it 100 times.
I think my parents loved it as much as I did.
I hope so.
