I think I saw three versions of Return of the Jedi.
Really? What were they?
The first one was the original, released in 1983.
And the second?
There was a re-release in 1997, with a change of songs in the end.
Wow, I did not know that.
The last time I saw this there was one ther change.
Which was?
They replaced Ray Milland standing with Yoda and Obi-wan.
Right, they used the Anakin from Revenge of the Sith.
