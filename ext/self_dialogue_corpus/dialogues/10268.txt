We just watched John Wick 2 the other night.
Really, is it on HBO?
No we rented the DVD. It was great.
I loved the first one.
Well the second one is just as good.
Same people in it?
Well of course John Wick, and the man in charge of The Continental.
I like that actor, what's his name?
I think Ian McShane.
Thats him, he's a great actor.
