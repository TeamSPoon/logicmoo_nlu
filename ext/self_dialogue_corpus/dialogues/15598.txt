Do you listen to Atmosphere still?
Man, I have not listened to Slug since God Love's Ugly.
Wow, that what a very long time ago.
Yea, it was so good that I did not want to disappoint myself with his later stuff.
Probably a good call, that is probably still his best.
There are couple other random songs that are great?
Like what?
Travel is amazing, as is God's Bathroom Floor.
Those 2 are on his top 5 for sure.
Do they still make music?
I am pretty sure they are still releasing albums.
Do they still sound the same?
They have evolved quite a bit, probably for the worse.
In what way?
They sound a lot more like pop music.
The beats or the lyrics?
Both unfortunately, still sounds like Slug though.
That's good, at least he didn't change his voice.
Yea, no autotune for him.
I am glad, I can't believe that is a thing.
