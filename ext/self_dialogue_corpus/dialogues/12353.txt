Who is your favorite star wars character?
Mine is Luke Skywalker.
If you had to choose between being a jedi or part of the sith, which would you choose?
I'd be a jedi.
What do you think about the Star Wars Prequels?
They're not as bad as everyone says they are. Outside of some bad acting and writing decisions, they're alright.
What color lightsaber would you have?
I'd have purple, because it's my favorite color.
Do you think Darth Vader is entirely bad?
He did some incredibly bad things, but he also had terrible things happen to him. I don't think he's entirely bad, but he's definitely done things too horrible to forgive.
