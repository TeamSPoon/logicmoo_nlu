What are you doing this weekend?
Going to a concert.
Cool. Which one?
Steppenwolf is playing in Jackpot.
What a cool band!
What's your favorite song?
Born to be Wild, of course.
I prefer Magic Carpet Ride.
Another classic.
You should come with me.
I'd love to.
I think there are still some tickets available.
Would you check for me?
Sure. They're like $35.
Totally doable!
You have Saturday free.
I do.
We should head down around 4.
Why so early.
Get in a little buffet action first.
