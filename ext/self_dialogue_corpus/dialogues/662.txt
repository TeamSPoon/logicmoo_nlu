What is your favorite NFL team?
The Cleveland Browns.
They're pretty bad how can you still be a fan?
I'm still a fan because I live in Cleveland and I'm loyal.
Must have been hard last season when you barely one 1 game.
A win is a win and you get them where you can.
Do you think they have a chance to win it all this year?
Maybe not this ear but definitely years to come.
Who do you think wins it this year?
The Patriots because there really isn't a better team right now.
And they always get an easy schedule.
This may be Tom Brady's last season so he's got nothing to lose.
I think he's got a few more years left in him.
Who do you think will win it all?
The Cowboys or the Green Bay Packers.
Smart choice.
I don't want to see Tom Brady win another championship.
I think it would be great for his legacy.
He'd already the greatet he just needs to retire.
You have got a point there.
