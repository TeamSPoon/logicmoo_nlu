What did you think of Joy?
Joy as in the emotion?
No as in the movie
I don't think I saw that one
It's the one with Jennifer Lawrence playing a QVC pioneer
Still not ringing any bells.
A David O Russel production. She sells a self wringing mop as her first product
Oh wait I think I remember this one. Is Bradley Cooper in it?
Yes, that's the one.
Ah okay. I heard about it, but never saw it.
It's a pretty good one. Good message the end.
Let me guess. A rags to riches story.
Yeah, but does a good job of showing all her challenges in between
Does she marry Cooper?
No, he plays the producer that gives her a chance
I see
Yeah, she ends up doing pretty well in the end
Well thanks for ruining it for me.
Well it's still worth watching
Okay, perhaps I'll check it out.
