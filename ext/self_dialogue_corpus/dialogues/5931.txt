What did you think about the new "Beauty and Beast" remake?
I thought it was superb! Emma Watson did such a great job as Belle!
Yes, I was very happy with that casting choice. She had the look, the voice, everything!
I liked how they made her an inventor like her dad. That was a nice touch.
I thought so too. The movie was so similar to the original cartoon version, but all of the little differences only added to the story in my opinion.
Yeah, I was very happy with this version, and you know what a huge "Beauty and the Beast" fan I am!
Oh I know that. I'm glad you liked it. The music was my favorite part. So many great songs in that movie.
I think I hummed "Be Our Guest" for days after seeing the movie. Such a catchy tune and Ewan McGregor performed it flawlessly!
Agreed! There's nothing that man can't do. I could listen to his voice for hours!
Me too! I'm heading to the store now, I gotta buy the DVD...the songs are already stuck in my head, might as well watch it while i'm humming the lyrics!
