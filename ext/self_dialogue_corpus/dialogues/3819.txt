Do you like Stephen Kings movies? He's my favorite author!
Yes. My favorite of his is The Shining
I love all of his movies but my all time favorite is The Stand
I don't think I've ever seen that
Really?! You need to watch it! It was a miniseries on tv. I also love Cujo and Carrie
Me too, I've seen both of those too.
Carrie was really good! when I first saw it, I was like 13. Scared me back then lol
Lol..it is a creepy movie that's for sure
The Shining was also great! Try to read and watch The Stand. The movie is just as good as the book though
Okay. I probably will do that soon.
