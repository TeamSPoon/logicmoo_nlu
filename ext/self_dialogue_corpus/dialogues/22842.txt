What a really great action movie?
You have to go with the best of all time, Die Hard.
Die Hard was an amazing movie, I have not watched it in many years. That's a good choice.
It's got everything you need in a great action movie and great characters.
Yeah, John McClane and of course Hans Gruber who was one of the best movie villains ever.
I could quote Hans Gruber all night. He had some pretty good lines.
Some people say Die Hard is a Christmas movie. Do you agree?
Well it takes place during the Christmas season. In the movie a Christmas party in the Nakatomi Plaza is interrupted by the terrorists.
Is there anything you did not like about Die Hard?
It's really hard to come up with anything negative to say about it. It's almost perfect.
Did you like the Die Hard sequels at all?
I liked the next two a lot, Die Hard 2: Die Harder and Die Hard With A Vengeance. I thought both of those were almost as good as the original
So you didn't like the more recent two Die Hard movies, Live Free or Die Hard and A Good Day to Die Hard?
Not at all, I thought both of those were pretty bad movie. They completely abandoned the things that made Die Hard great.
They didn't have a lot of humor in the recent movies. Also Bruce Willis seemed like he didn't want to be there and it showed in his performance.
Also the stunt just got too ridiculous in the later movies. They were always a little ridiculous but they were at least semi-plausible in the early movies.
They also made John McClane into almost a super hero who could do anything in the last two Die Hard movies.
YEah that whole point of his character is that he's supposed to be an average guy who gets thrown into crazy situations.
Do you think they will make any more Die Hard movies?
I hope not, just let it be. We got three great and timeless movies out of the series and I'm perfectly happy with that.
