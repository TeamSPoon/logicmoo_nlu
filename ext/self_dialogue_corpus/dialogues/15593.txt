Do you like Country music at all?
I do listen to some! I like a mix of all music.
Who would you have to say is your favorite?
I remember as a kid one of my good friends loved Leann Rimes. Do you remember her?
Yes I do! She had such a gorgeous voice.
My friend would always belt her songs at recess.
I always wanted to see her in concert. Which of her songs was your favorite?
It has to be one of her most popular "How Do I Live".
"How do I live without you?"
Yes! Such a great song!
Another really good one was "You Light Up My Life". Loved that one.
Her voice sounded gorgeous in that one.
You don't hear about her really anymore.
No you don't, that's a shame.
It is. I wish they still made music like hers today.
I agree. A lot of artists just don't compare.
Are you a fan of other genres of music also?
I am. I like rock music or r&b too.
Me too! I love the classics.
Yes, back when artists put more effort and soul into their music.
