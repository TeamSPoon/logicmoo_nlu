Are you much of a country music fan?
No, I can't say I am.
I'm the same way, I just can't really get into the stuff.
Why did you bring it up.
Well, I've got a new girlfriend, and she's really into country music.
Yikes! She might not be a keeper.
Settle down. We get along great and she's an amazing woman, it's just the country music thing.
Have you listened to any country music since you guys started dating?
Yep, I've tried to get into it a little, or at least see what she sees in it.
And how has that gone?
Not amazingly well. I've found a few songs that are OK, but mostly I'm not a fan.
What have you liked.
There's a song called 'My Wish' that's not bad.
Who sings it?
A group called 'Rascal Flatts'.
Never heard of them.
Yeah, me neither until recently. Some of it is decent, but most of it just doesn't work for me.
Are you going to keep listening to country music?
I guess I sort of have to, as long as I'm with my girlfriend.
Poor guy! Maybe you'll start to get used to it.
