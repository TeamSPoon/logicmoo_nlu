Well I will admit to enjoying some of the songs back in the day.

Hangin' tough and everyone liked step by step.
Both great tunes in my book, Don't be embarrassed.
No guy really admits they like boy bands. Well maybe some.
Well what is your favorite boy band?
I would say 'n sync or backstreet boys, they were popular when I was in highschool.
Of course I adore them as well. So many memories get linked to certain songs.
True, I recall vivid images at a school dance while bye bye bye played.
