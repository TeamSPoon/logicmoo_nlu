Remember that Sith Lord in the STAR WARS movies?
He looked really scary.
At first he looked kind of normal.
But even when he looked normal he still was scary.
Then he got in that fight.
All that electricity came out of him.
And it aged him like hundreds of years.
He looked really old after that.
Then someone threw him over the rail I think.
I think Luke got mad and threw him over the rail.
