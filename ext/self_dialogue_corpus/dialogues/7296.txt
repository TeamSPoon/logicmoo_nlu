Mate, have you seen the live action Jungle Book.
The one directed by Jon Favreau.
Yeah that's the one.
Yeah why?
Do you know who played King Louis?
No, I thought it was all CGI.
Yeah that animals were but they had real actors voicing them. Anyway King Louis was voiced by Christopher Walken.
Christopher Walken. No way.
Ha ha, you do such a great Christopher Walken.
Ha ha, everyone needs to learn to do a Christopher Walken expression. You could say it's the bare necessities of life!
