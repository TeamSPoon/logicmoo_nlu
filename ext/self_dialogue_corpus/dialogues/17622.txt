Did you know on the album cover that person isn't just some random make up character?

It's a comic book character who is like some phantom driver

He's a phantom driver who died i think, and the meaning of the song is he wants to drive his girlfriend around.
That's pretty interesting. I love songs with a background and meaning to it.
