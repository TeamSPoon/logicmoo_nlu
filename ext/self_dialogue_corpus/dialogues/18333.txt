Do you remember when our kids would listen to Chumbawamba all the time?
Yes. Tubthumping.
They had a few hits from the album.
Yes, and used in movies too.
They broke up back in 2012.
Did they really?
Yes, and they were still good.
They could have had a lot more hits.
Well their old music is still played.
Their one song was in a General Motors commercuial. I can't remember the name of it though.
Enough is Enough was a pretty good song.
I'm not sure if I know that one.
You would if you heard it.
Did you have any of their CD's?
Yes. Tubthumping.
Do you still have it?
Yes I do.
We should put it in someday.
I still do listen to some of my old ones.
Nothing wrong with that. Good songs.
