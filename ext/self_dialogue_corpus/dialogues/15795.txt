Have you ever heard Hawkwind?
A little bit... they made space-rock music, right?
Yes, psychedelic hard rock that sort of overlapped with heavy metal.
That's interesting. Wasn't Lemmy from Motorhead in that band?
Yes, but they fired him sometime in the mid-'70s for excessive drug use.
That's too bad. How would you describe their sound?
Well, it's very cosmic, I would say.
So do you think they might have influenced later bands?
Yes, I think Sonic Youth took some influence from Hawkwind, for certain.
You mean their songs are long and noisy, with clanging guitar sections?
Not exactly, but sometimes they get very spacious, and kind of warm and ambient.
Sounds relaxing.
Yeah, a band I definitely think Hawkwind influenced are Radiohead.
Really? That sounds pretty intriguing.
Yeah, the way an album like OK Computer kind of bathes you in electronic sounds during the rock songs is very Hawkwind to me.
Aren't what they would kind of call "space rock"?
Yeah, definitely, and some of their songs are more aggressive, and others more mellow.
They sound like a band you could put on whatever your mood.
My favorite Hawkwind album is called "Warrior on the Edge of Time," and it's very sci-fi influenced, lyrically.
Thanks, I'll have to go check it out!
