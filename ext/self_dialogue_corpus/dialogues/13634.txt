What do you think of the new Star Wars movie?
I liked The Force Awakens for the most part.
Were you surprised when Han Solo died?
I was. I couldn't believe he would die like that of all people. I feel like Princess Lea should of been the one to die.
Which character was your favorite? I really like Rey.
Rey is cool but so is the Storm Trooper guy named Finn.
Do you think Rey is Luke Skywalker's daughter or Han Solo's?
It's so hard to tell. On one hand I really feel like Luke was but there was that one line that implied Han could of been her dad.
I have one feeling that she is Kylo Ren's twin since in the book series Han Solo and Lea had twins.
That would be really freaky if she was Kylo Ren's long lost twin.
