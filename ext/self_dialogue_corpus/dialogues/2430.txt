Who do you think is the older NFL player?
It's got to be Tom Brady right?
Not even close.
But he's 39 and I think the oldest was Brett Farve and he retired at 40.
You'd think that but he isn't the oldest.
The who is it? He can't be on a ppular team or I'd feel I would know who it is.
Actually he plays for the Colts.
What!? No way.
Yup, it's Adam Vinatieri.
What position does he play I don't know the guy at all.
He's a place kicker.
No wonder I don't know him.
I think play kickers are failry ignored.
Yeah they are I can confirm it. How old is he?
He is 44 years old now.
Wow thats crazy, is he any good? I mean does he still play well.
Yeah well enough to be paid millions to play the game.
Yeah I guess so. I remember when I gave Farve a hard time because of his age.
The guy is proof age is just a number.
No kidding.
