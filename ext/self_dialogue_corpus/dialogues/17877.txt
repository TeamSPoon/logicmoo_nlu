What do you think of Pavement?
Who are they?
They were an indie rock band, active around the 90s.
What do they sound like?
Off kilter, noisy, catchy rock.
Interesting. What's your favorite album?
Hard to decide. Maybe Crooked Rain Crooked Rain.
Nice. What songs from there do you like?
Cut Your Hair is the obvious "hit". But I really like Type Slowly.
Cool. What else?
I like their album Wowee Zowee too.
What's that like?
Really offbeat. It took me a while to get round to liking it, but it grew on me.
Really? Why?
They all sound off-key and strange. Maybe like they were taking too many drugs. But they have strangely great tunes, too.
Haha, awesome. Are they a good live act too?
Yeah, I saw them once, they were wonderful. But they broke up in 1999.
Aw, that's too bad.
But I heard they got back together and did a reunion show.
That's great.
