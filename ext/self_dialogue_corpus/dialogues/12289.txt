What is the greatest weapon in the Star Wars movies?
The Force!
No, I mean a physical weapon.
Oh, in that case it is Chewbacca's bowcaster.
How is that the greatest weapon?
It's just cool. I mean it's a laser crossbow. How can anything compete with that?
Laser Swords? Perhaps?
Oh, yeah, I guess the lightsaber is really the coolest.
It's my favorite, but you can pick the bowcaster if you want.
Nope, I am switching to Light Saber.
