What was your favorite part of Rogue One?
I loved the very ending when Darth Vader turned on his lightsaber.
Yes! When the room was dark and then all of a sudden a red lightsaber slowly appears.
That was the Darth Vader that we deserve!
That scene was perfect. You could hear his breathing while the scene was dark, and you just knew that something bad was going to happen.
And the music accompanied that scene so well.
I wonder if we will ever see another Darth Vader scene.
If we do, it will not be for a long time.
Maybe they will have a flashback scene in the next Star Wars movie that's coming out this year.
That would be one of so many reasons to be excited for Star Wars XIII!
