What is the best rock concert you ever saw?
I went to see AC/DC on their Who Made Who Tour and they knocked my socks off!
Angus Young is an amazing performer, who opened up for them?
Guns N Roses opened for them, and they were great too.
Oh sure, and now Axl Rose is singing with AC/DC, isn't he?
I believe so, now that Brian Johnson left the band for medical reasons.
Brian Johnson is a hard act to follow, his voice is so distinct.
It is, but Axl has put his own spin on things.
All of the other members of AC/DC are phenomenal, but you first notice that lead singer.
You're right, I don't know how diehard fans of AC/DC are going to feel about Axl singing lead.
