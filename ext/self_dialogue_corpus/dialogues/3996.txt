what thriller have you watched recently?
I just watched an old one from the 80s.Blood simple.
I have never heard of it.
I had not myself, it was done by the coen brothers.
Must be one of the first ones they did , if that far back.
I think it was their first feature. It was good.
Who is in it?
Francis Mcdermott.
I like her alot. Now I am even more surprised I don't know this film.
It was weird to see her so young. I also think of her as an older mother type.
