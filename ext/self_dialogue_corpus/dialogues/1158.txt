Do you watch football?
Yeah, I do. Why do you ask?
Well I watch it a lot and I wanted to know your favorite team.
My favorite team is the Cleveland Browns, what's yours?
I would have to say the New York Giants.
Do you have any favorite foods you like to eat while watching games?
Yes, I always get hot wings and sometimes nachos. How about you?
Well, sometimes I have had hot wings during games. I usually have pizza though.
I love pizza, what kind do you usually get?
I enjoy almost any type of pizza, but do you mean my favorite?
Yeah, what is your favorite pizza?
I would have to say supreme.
What does that have on it?
Green peppers, mushrooms, pepperoni, cheese, onions, and sausage.
Wow, that sounds like a really good pizza.
Yeah, I always like the ones with more ingredients on them.
I'm gonna have to check that out next time I get pizza.
I would definitely recommend it, and you could order wings from the same place too.
You, know that's a really good idea. Thanks a lot.
No problem, enjoy yourself.
