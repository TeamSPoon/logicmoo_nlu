Have you seen any good horror movies recently?
I liked The Invitation and the Purge
Which one did you like better?
I liked the Purge, the idea is so crazy!
What's the plot about again?
Well one day a year you can do whatever crime you want
Even murder and steal?
Yeah, well that's what the whole movie is about
Is that it?
Well one family takes in a black guy that others are trying to kill and they have to protect him now
