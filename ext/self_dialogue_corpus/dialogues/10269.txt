What's your favorite action movie that is based on a television show?
That would be The Fugitive.
Is that the Harrisson Ford film from the 90s?
Yep, that's the one.
That is a great film and I especially enjoyed Tommy Lee Jones's character.
I agree, he was fantastic.
Did you know that he improvised the line, "I don't care!"?
I think I had heard that before. It's a great line.
Let's not forget about Harrisson Ford either. He was excellent as well.
I think he was good, but not great.
