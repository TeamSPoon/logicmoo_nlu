How about La La Land winning best picture?
Well, it is made like an old time Hollywood musical and I don't like them, so I wasn't that crazy about this one.
Yeah, I can understand that.
And the trouble is the academy likes to give awards to movies about show business.
Wait a minute, La La didn't win.
Oh, right, the snafu--it was actually Moonlight.
How could we forget.
Do you think the issue about black artists could have had something to do with Moonlight winning?
Could be, I didn't see, the movie and it is supposed to good, but then I'm sure Hollywood would like to be in the forefront of social awareness
Yeah, it's hard to know.
Did you like any other of the nominated movies.
Yeah, I really liked Hidden Figures.  It was educational, entertaining, and fascinating.
There was your racial and gender issue--a real political winner if the academy wanted to go that way.
Yeah, I suppose--I liked that aspect and the little known history was wonderful and pretty factual I read.
See any of the other movies?
Well, I saw Arrival and fell asleep in it, but the people I was with thought it was pretty good.
It is pretty weird--I had a hard time with it, too.  Any others?
Yes, Lion, it was a real feel good movie.
Is that the one where the boy from India gets separated from his family?
Yes, not academy award winner quality, but really good--you'll enjoy it.
