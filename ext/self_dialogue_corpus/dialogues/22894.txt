Have you seen any of the Cube movies?
I've seen the third one, Cube Zero.
Oh okay, so you know kind of the premise of it then.
Yeah, but I wouldn't mind seeing them from the beginning.
The first one I thought was more well done than the third, it definitely has a surprise ending, but I thought Cube 2 was the scariest.
Really?
Yeah, it legitimately made me squirm in places.
Because of the traps?
No not the traps, the characters. One in particular was very menacing.
Oh okay. There were some scary aspects of Cube Zero I thought.
For sure. I just remember it being a little more tame.
Incinerating people when they say they don't believe in God doesn't sound very tame...
True. I just remember psychologically the second one was hard to watch.
I gotcha. Well I really liked Zachary Bennett in Cube Zero.
I don't blame you!
We should watch them together sometime.
Definitely. Maybe during the day though, because I know they're supposed to be mystery/sci-fi or whatever but I think of them as thriller, they're kind of scary.
No worries.
I can't wait.
I can't wait till we get to the watches part!
