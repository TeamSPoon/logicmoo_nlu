Do you think it's safe to say Edgar Wright is one of the best directors of all time?
I think you can make a case for that sure.
It's just I feel like a lot of people look at most of his work as comedies and don't take them seriously.
That's on them, Hot Fuzz is a masterpiece.
Not to mention the visual treat that Scott Pilgrim ended up being.
Yeah Edgar Wright did those comics justice on the big screen.
Although I could have done without Michael Cera as Scott Pilgrim.
Yeah a bit of a weird casting but it worked for me.
I'm really excited to see Baby Driver.
Yeah looks to be another Edgar Wright hit.
There's something about his style, you can just tell it's him.
Yeah that's like even with him off of Ant-Man you still kind of got his vibes.
Yeah it was still his screenplay I believe, or at least some of it.
Definitley noticeable, wish he was allowed to stay on the project.
Yeah but you know how it goes with Marvel, their way or the highway.
Which I think is fine as its their cinematic universe, but a totally Wright helmed Ant-Man, oh boy.
Yeah it'd be nice to see him get on that level of Marvel blockbuster.
Worked for Joss Whedon.
Sort of, he ended up not really enjoying doing Avengers if I recall.
Yeah but he made one of the best super hero movies of all time.
