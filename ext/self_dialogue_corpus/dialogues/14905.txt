Do you know the movie Bad Grandpa?
Yep, I actually just watched it yesterday.
Did you like it ?
Yeah, It was over the top hilarious just like the other movies with johnny noxville.
I thought it was even better than the jackass movies.
Yeah, they didn't really have to use nudity and disgusting things to make it funny.
Well, they did a little bit, but it was perfect.
Haha, like the scene with the fish.
Oh my god that scene was so funny I can't help but laugh every time I watch it.
Same, I really enjoyed that part.
