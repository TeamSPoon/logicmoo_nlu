Did you see Knocked Up?
Is that the Seth Rogen movie?
Yes! The plot involves him getting a girl pregnant that he just met.
Oh wow, that sounds like quite a predicament.
It definitely is. He has to learn how to be a partner and a dad and an adult.
I love Seth Rogen. He does a great job of being funny but being approachable.
The movie is hilarious. It was directed by Judd Apatow.
Did he also direct the 40 Year Old Virgin?
He did! Judd Apatow has his hand in so many great comedies.
At this point, he must have made a lot of money from those movies.
