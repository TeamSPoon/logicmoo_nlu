I just recently watched Live Free or Die Hard.
What did you think?
It was just alright, nothing special.
Really, I thought it was the second best of all the Die Hard films.
That's interesting, what did you like about it?
While there were some things I thought were dumb, I loved the action sequences.
Weren't they a little too ridiculous?
C'mon, it's die hard though! The franchise has always been over-the-top.
I suppose that's true.
Bruce Willis is always fun as well.
I agree with that, I always love his one-liners.
Yeah and he had some good ones in that film.
Not quite as many memorable ones as in the first Die Hard though.
That's true, those lines are iconic.
What did you think of the antagonist?
I thought he was serviceable. I like the actor, Timothy Olyphant.
I didn't really like him.
Why not?
He seemed weak compared to a lot of the other Die Hard villains.
That's true, probably because he was a programmer rather than your typical terrorist.
