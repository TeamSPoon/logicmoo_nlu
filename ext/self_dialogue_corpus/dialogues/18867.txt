Have you heard of Phantogram?
No, who are they?
They're this duo from New York that have a eclectic pop sound.
Sounds cool, maybe I have heard a song of theirs and not realized it.
Probably. They are getting pretty mainstream.
What's their latest album?
It's called Three, and it is their third album.
Cool. I'll have to check it out. What do they sound like?
They sound like Little Dragon a bit, or even Sylvan Esso.
Oh yeah?! I really like them.
I'm surprised you haven't heard of Phantogram.
Yeah, me too. How is the newest album?
It's good, but it feels like they are trying to reach a wider audience.
Does it sound over produced?
No, the lead female singer is sounding much better, but they lost some of their eclectic sound.
In what way?
It just sounds like everything else that's out there now.
That's not necessarily Phantogram's fault.
True, but the earlier albums are so much more unique in sound than the new stuff.
I know what you mean. I hate it when bands lose their core sound, or sell out.
