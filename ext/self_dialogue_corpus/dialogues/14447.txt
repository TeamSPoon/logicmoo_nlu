Did you see that Cavalier game the other night?
Yes! Pure fire.
Lebron was killing it.
I know, did you see how he was moving up and down that court.
Yes! it was like he was on the court playing an amateur team.
I know, the Celtics got schooled.
You know man, I used to be a huge Celtics fan.
I know they used to be good.
It's like they have lost their mojo.
Its either that or Cleavland is just that good.
You mean Lebron is just that good.
Nah, you got Irving and Love.
Yeah, yeah..I know.
You also got Shumpert. He's good as well.
But, that Lebron is a beast.
Yes, he is he made Boston look like school yard boys.
Poor Isaiah Thomas, trying his hardest to keep up.
The whole game was funny, 44 points, you kidding me.
I can't wait until game 2.
It's gonna be awesome.
