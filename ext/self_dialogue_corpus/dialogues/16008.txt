Did you do pep band just in high school, or in college too?
I was in it in college as a tuba player. Trumpet was for high school.
Any super fun experiences with that?
Just one. Mostly it was just garbage playing in the gym and getting paid.
You got paid for that? I figured it would be for a credit.
No, no credits. We performed pre-game, post-game, and during time-outs.
What kind of music?
80's and 90s, for the most part.
So how'd they pay you super-rich musicians?
Exactly as you'd expect: $15, pizza, and soda.
Yay pizza!
Yeah, but it was early 2000s Dominos when there was even less flavor.
Ha. So, your favorite part?
Our women's basketball team was 11-17 going into the tournament, and won the conference at 14-17.
Nice! Sounds like a weak conference.
Very. So they went to the NCAA tournament. The athletics team flew us to Knoxville, where we played the #1 seed.
I figure they lost. How'd the band sound?
Surprisingly, our band got the #1 ranking in the NCAA tournament!
Really? Wow!
Yeah ... all the university's top bands were sent to the men's tournament. Kind of sad, but we sounded great anyway.
