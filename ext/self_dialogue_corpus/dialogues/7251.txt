I can't believe how many Disney movies have come out over the years. How many can you name?
Well, let me think. Bambi, Cinderella, Aladdin, The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, Alice in Wonderland.
You're pretty good! Can you think of any others off the top of your head?
What about the one with the bears? I can remember them singing about bear necessities, but I can't recall the name of the movie.
Oh, yeah! Now I can't remember it either!
That's funny. I know Disney made Lady and the Tramp, and Brother Bear, but I don't think it's in either of those two movies.
No, definitely not. Maybe it was the Jungle Book?
Yes! I believe that's the one.
I'm going to have to dig out my old VHS movies now and watch some of these great Disney movies! Thanks for the reminder!
Well, I'll have to bring the family over to watch them with you then. Sounds like fun!
