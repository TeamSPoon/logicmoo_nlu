Did you see the game between the Warriors and the Spurs last night?
Yes, I did, Spurs did pretty good the 1st half.
They ended the first half a little ahead, and I thought maybe they might have a chance.
I had my doubts, as the Spurs are down two to one and don't have Leonard or Parker playing.
The youngsters did a pretty good job trying to keep up the second half, but just couldn't quite do it.
That's ok, they had a respectable score at the end and there is always next season.
Hopefully Leonard and Parker can get back next season and bring it home for the Spurs.
I agree, and the newbies will have increased their skills too.
What did you think about Aldridge?
Everyone says he has the skills, but somehow he is not performing up to par.
To me, it looks like he just doesn't have the confidence.
I agree.
He sure isn't a Tim Duncan.
I really miss him.
Me too, ah well, the Spurs have what they have
Yep, hoping for a great season next year.
What do you think about what Ginobli is doing this season.
Way beyond expectations, although he seemed to be off last night
Yah, but he is fun to watch , no matter what
He sure is, he isn't afraid of anyone.
