Have you heard that line "show me you teeth" from Lady Gaga?
Yes a drunk guy at a bar said it to me over and over one night.
Ha! What do you think of applause?
I love it because my girlfriend embodies that song
She has that one song about cheating too
Yeah my girlfriend cheated on me one night while i was listening to that
When lady gaga first came out what did you think of her?
I loved poker face. It didn't sound like any other song at the time.
I liked when she wore that meat dress.
Oh me too. It was a far cry from Tony Bennett times.
