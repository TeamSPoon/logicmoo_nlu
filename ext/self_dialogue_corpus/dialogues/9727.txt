Do you like rap music?
Um, it's ok. I don't dis like it. But I'm also not a big fan.
I feel the same.
But I do like it when it's late and I'm driving. It helps to keep me alert.
That's neat. If I'm going to listen to it I like to hear deep bass.
Like apple bottom jeans by T-Pain?
Yeah. That's a good one. Probably good for driving too.
It is. I really like the old snoop dogg and Dr. dre.
Like the next episode and Ain't nuthin but a g Thang.
Yep exactly.
