Hey Frank how was your weekend?
It was good Billy and yours?
Was good I went to see that new movie Rough night with my girlfriend!
Oh how was it?
It was pretty funny!
Really? Who was in the movie?Anyone that really stands out?
It had Scarlett Johansson and a bunch of other actresses and actors I never heard about.
Hmm seems like a movie that I might take my wife?
Yeah! I think your wife would like it.
What was it about?
The basic theme is that a group of girlfriends hire a male stripper for a bachelorette party in Miami, but then things start to really go wrong.
Haha sounds funny
Yeah it had pretty funny moments
I wonder if they shot the movie in any places we know.
Yeah I was looking for the office building we work haha
I'm going to recommend the movie to my wife to watch this upcoming weekend!
Ok hope you guys like it.

Yep you guys will love it!
