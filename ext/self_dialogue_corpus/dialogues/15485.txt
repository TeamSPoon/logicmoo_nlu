Have you heard of Alexander Scriabin?
No, who's that?
He's a turn-of-the-Century composer in Russia.
Which century?
Late 19th-early 20th.
So, why are you bringing him up?
He tried to end the world. With music.
WHAT? How?
He had a vision that his symphony would bring upon the apocalypse.
That must have been super dissonant.
Actually, his music wasn't.
So how would it have worked?
He imagined it being performed in the mountains, with huge bells, lights, and the full orchestra and choir.
Kind of the ultimate culmination of music?
Pretty much.
So, why didn't it work?
What do you mean?
Well, we're alive, so it failed.
Right, ha. He died before it finished.
Maybe he miscalculated: "End me" instead of "End the World"
