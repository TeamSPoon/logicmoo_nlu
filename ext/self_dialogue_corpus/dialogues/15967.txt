What do you think of anime music?
I absolutely love it.
Me too, I am a huge fan.
My favorite anime composer is Yoko Kanno.
Cowboy Bebop is an amazing soundtrack.
I know and Wolf's Rain is beautiful as well.
I also love the studio ghibli movie soundtracks.
They are beautiful Joe Hisashi is the man.
The craziest soundtrack in anime is Akira.
It sounds like something not from this world.
That is because it is a unique style which mixed balinese percussion and electronic music.
Wow, that can be why it sounds so hypnotic.
Yes, I believe the percussive sounds had some mystic religious element to them.
This is very interesting indeed.  Sometimes anime music is silly though.
I love J-Pop, but sometimes if I hear something enough I fast forward the theme song.
A lot of J-Pop is really catchy though.
Yes I find myself singing along to the Dragon Ball Z Theme song.
Still I think that Yoko Kanno and Joe Hisashi are some of the best anime composers.
I have to agree since the music is sophisticated and beautiful.
Yes definitely, I love the variety and orchestrations.
