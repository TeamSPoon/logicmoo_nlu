The Expendables was an excellent movie.
Sounds familiar, who's in it?
Sylvestor Stallone and Jason Statham.
Don't remember if I watched that one.
It's from 2010. They were mercenaries.
Theres so many movies like that.
Yes, but not with those two in it.
True, then I guess I didn't see it.
It's an hour and fourty minutes but it goes so fast.
Lots of action with those two. Thats why.
