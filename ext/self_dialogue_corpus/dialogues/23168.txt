Do you like romantic comedies?
Of course! In fact I just watched There's Something About Mary with my girl the other day.
That's a classic! Ben Stiller and Cameron Diaz are amazing in it.
And Matt Dillon. Have you seen him in Drugstore Cowboy?
No, what's that about?
He and his crew of addicts rob pharmacies and stuff to get prescription drugs.
Sounds interesting. Have you seen any other movies lately?
Hm, as far as rom-coms go, not really. I saw Rough Night, though.
Oh, the one with Scarlett Johansson?
Yeah, it was entertaining. Not the best. Scarlett's been in better movies, like her Woody Allen movies.
Oh yeah, I really liked Match Point. She was really good in that.
It was kind of like Crimes and Misdemeanors, huh?
Yeah, totally. I'm surprised there wasn't more buzz about it, it was really well done.
Did you see Scoop?
Yeah, it was ok. I like how he weaved the magician part into it.
I really liked Vicky Cristina Barcelona. I wish I could have been in that one!
I didn't see it. Have you seen Scarlett's earlier movies, like Ghost World?
That is one of my favorites. I felt so terrible for Steve Buscemi in that one.
Yeah, he gets used by Enid. I wish Scarlett had had a bigger role in it.
She was just starting out then. I want to see Lucy now because we've been talking about her movies.
