Are you going to watch the NFL opening game?
Yes I am I'm so excited
What about the hall of fame game?
Who is playing?
I believe it's the cowboys versus the cardinals
Both of those teams have a good chance to win
I agree with you on that, it will certainly be interesting
I really hope the cowboys win, they are one of my favorite teams
I think they have a good shot
It will be interesting to see how it all ends up
I wonder if wall the starters are going to play
Most likely not because it's before The season
Yeah I think the coaches may be wise not to start their best players yet
They want to avoid injuries
Yes, because afterall, the game doesn't really matter
It's just another way for the NFL to make money off the players
Yep I totally agree.
Well then it kind of seems immoral when you put it that way.
That's why I actually think I will not be watching this year
I agree, we should both wait to watch until the regular season
