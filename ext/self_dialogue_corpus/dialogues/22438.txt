Is there anything more jolly than a good Christmas movie?
Not at all, I can watch Christmas movies over and over, no matter the time of the year.
That's the magic of them, everybody loves Christmas, it gives good vibes.
Yup, it doesn't matter when you watch them because everyone is always pining for that holiday cheer.
What's your favorite Christmas movie?
That's a tough one, I want to veer towards the animated classics like Rudolph and Year Without A Santa Claus, but I don't know.
For me it's probably Christmas Vacation, it's hard to beat.
Yeah that one has everything, good family bonding, great comedy, Chevy Chase at his best.
Yeah I can watch it over and over and never get sick of it, I love the TV marathons during the month of December.
Speaking of TV marathon how can we not mention A Christmas Story.
Yeah the undisputed classic.
Even if it's not one's favorite it's probably arugably the best Christmas film ever made.
It's brilliantly acted and written, captures that era so well.
Definitley does, it's such a funny take on the holiday.
Drink your Ovaltine, teaching kids to never expect the best.
One of the best scenes of all time, Ralph's reaction to that is the greatest.
The use of narration in A Christmas Story sends it over the top of greatness for me.
Yeah sometimes narration can ruin a movie, but in this case it gave it perfect comedic sense.
All of this talk has me wanting to go get in the holiday cheer.
Yeah I think I'll watch A Christmas Story tonight.
