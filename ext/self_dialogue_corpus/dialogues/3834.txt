I just watched The Conjuring again. It had been a while since I'd seen it and it was just as good as before.
I need to watch that again.
Yeah, I watched it with my boyfriend in order to prepare for The Conjuring 2!
Oh yeah, didn't that just come out on HBO?
Yep, we've been waiting for it to be released on there. So now we can watch it!
Are there any new horror movies coming out in theaters?
Yeah, there are a couple this summer and then a few more in the Fall.
Annabelle: Creation is coming out in August, I think. Isn't that part of The Conjuring franchise?
Yes! And it's the sequel to Annabelle.
Have you seen the preview for the remake of Flatliners?
