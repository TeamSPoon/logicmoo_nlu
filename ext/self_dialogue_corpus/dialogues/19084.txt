Have you heard of the band Home Free?
No I haven't, who are they?
They are an a Capella band that has done many covers of country music, as well as some pop music.
Would I have heard any of their music?
They were on The Sing Off a few years ago and won.  They did a great cover of Amazing Grace.
I think I might have seen them on that show.  They were really good.
Yes, I really enjoy listening to them whenever I can.
Are they played on mainstream radio?
I have not heard them on mainstream radio, but I listen to them on YouTube.
I will definitely have to check them out.
You really should, their music always puts me in a good mood.
What's your favorite song or songs of theirs?
I listen to "We all want what we ain't got" and "Colder Weather" quite a bit.
What makes those songs so good?
I really enjoy the emotion and harmony they put into their songs.
I will watch them on YouTube really soon.
I do not think that you will be disappointed.
I doubt I will, I love music, and this group seems to be really, really talented.
They are.  I find it hard to listen to any music other than theirs.
As a big music fan, I am really looking forward to listening to them.  Thank you for sharing!
