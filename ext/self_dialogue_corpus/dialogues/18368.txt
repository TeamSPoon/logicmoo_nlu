Adele finished the last show on her tour, and said she may neer tour again.
Why? Was it because of the tour?
No, she said she's not good at touring, she's a homebody.
I don't see why she should have to tour if she doesn't want to- people will still buy her music.
This tour was for her album 25 from 2015.
How long has she been on the road?
She played 123 shows.
Wow. Well, i hope she thinks it was worth it.
Her album was the best selling album in 2016, even though it came out the year before.
So it was worth it.
She said she wanted to do it for the fans, so that she could have an impact on them the way her favorite bands had for her.
Did she announce this at the show?
No, she put a handwritten note in the program guide.
Well, that is a great souvenir for people to have.
Her last show was in London, and she said she wanted to play her hometwon last, since she didn't know if she would ever tour again.
Doesn't she have a little boy? Maybe it's hard touring with a small child.
Yes, he is four and a half. So that might be the reason, if she's planning to have him start school this fall.
Children do need stability.
I don't think not touring will hurt her career, and fans can still look forward to her music through albums.
I agree. And her family is the most important thing.
