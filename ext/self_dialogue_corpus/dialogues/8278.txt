oh it's gotta have to be katy perry
why is that?
oh, she's amazing alright, do you know she's the first one to have 100 million followers on Twitter?

I heard of her music before, she was at last year's superbowl opening
she always got some very unique costume and stage designs, last year's superbowl opening wasn't an exception
