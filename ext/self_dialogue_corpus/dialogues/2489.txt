Are you excited for the upcoming NFL season?
Can't wait for it to begin.
What team are you going for this year?
The Giants.
I'm going to stick with my Cowboys.
They have some pretty good players this year.
Yes, like Heath, when they let him play.
Right. In the past couple of years Heath has accounted for five turnovers, four interceptions and one forced fumble.
You seem to know your stuff.
I said my team is the Giants, I didn't say I don't keep up on stats concerning other players.
Alright, alright.
You know, another good Cowboy player is Jason Witten.
Yeah, but he is getting up there in age.
You sound, like you are saying he is fragile, ha ha.
No I'm not saying that, it's just that injuries do happen.
The dude has played with fractured ribs, a concussion, a lacerated spleen and a sprained knee.
Now you make him sound like he is unstoppable.
Call it what you will.
We will see how he plays this season.
I will be keeping an eye out for him and of course watch my Giants.
