Mark Hamill is looking pretty old in the most recent trailer.
He is old.  You have to remember the original came out 40 years ago.
Which is nuts if you think about it.  It still holds up well today.
I believe Mark is 65 now so it's expected he's going to show some age.
I'm very interested to see his character progression this movie.
Yeah.  It strikes me that this a older, wiser Luke.
Probably a Luke who is done with fighting overall and lacks some purpose.
I think he knows a purpose, but might be too disillusioned to chase it.
I'm predicting Luke dies in this next movie.
Don't say that, we already lost Han!
