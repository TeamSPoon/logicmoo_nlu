so what did you do last night?
Oh I just stayed in bed and watched Aladdin.
I love Aladdin! I haven't seen it in years.
Yea it had been a little while for me too. It still holds up.
Oh I'm sure. I remember I used to be able to quote all of the Genies lines.
Oh yea I can imagine. There's so many good ones.
I loved his cheerleader bit. "If he can't do it, Great!"
I laughed really hard at that last night. I forgot how much I loved that bit.
Yea, you know I'm going to have "A whole new world" stuck in my head all day.
Oh I'm right there with you. Its been in my head for the last four hours.
