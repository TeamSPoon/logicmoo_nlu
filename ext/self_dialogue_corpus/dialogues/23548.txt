If you had to pick, what would be your favorite movie of all time?
Wow, bad question. I have a few.
Well which one comes to mind first.
I guess Shaun of the Dead.
That is hilarious. I love that one too.
Yea they were all great in that film.
Simon Pegg is a great actor. He doesn't get enough credit.
No he doesn't.
My favorite part was when they were in the Winchester and the juke box came on.
Yea, Queen right?
Yes, and they were beating the zombies to the beat of the music.
That was so funny. That is a great movie.
I could watch that every time it's on.
Me too.
His friend in that movie is funny too.
You mean Ed?
Yeah, what's that actors name.
Nick Frost I think.
Yeah, that's him.
I like how he's a zombie at the end.
