Did you catch the Chargers game last night?
No. I had to work. Who did they play?
The Chargers.
Did they lose again?
Yes. And I was rooting for their team too
Who the Chargers or the Lions?
The Chargers.It seems like the last two games they played were losses.
Alot of people watch these games out because they like the sport
And you ?
I like the sport and certain teams
So your saying that even if a losing team is playing they watch because they just like football?
That's it.
Also these teams get alot of hype and publicity to sell tickets
I know they really hype some of these players up but when you watch them play its not that good.
Yeah I the 49er are just a little overhyped I should say
I agree. Their players aren't that good- the rookies either
Some of the players should just retire
They wait until they are late 40's early 50's or so
So is that why they are called the 49ers?
Yeah, their players are 49 years old. Ha ha ha.
