Do you remember the Ickey Shuffle?
The endzone dance that Ickey Woods used to do?
Yes, exactly - I think it is great when players celebrate in the endzone!
I agree - what team did Icky Woods play for?
He played for the Cincinnati Bengals.
That's right - and Boomer Esiason was the quarterback!
Yeah, he was a great quarterback.
Very successful - and I thought his final season when he came back to the Bengals was great.
I enjoy his NFL commentary - a great crossover career for a great quarterback.
I think the NFL does really well with its broadcasting commentary - really keeps the audience engaged in the players and statistics.
Yeah, sports statistics are a huge hobby of mine, especially with the NFL.
True - NFL football is quite complex statistically, even more so than baseball.
Speaking of stats - Esiason has a lot of top ten records in the NFL for quarterbacks.
I even remember when he had that terrible concussion from Bruce Smith.
Yeah - hit him under the face mask and down when Boomer!
But he made a great return against the Bills later on in the season.
He was even in that Geico Insurance commercial recently!
I know - he had a very short career due to injuries - he was a great running back.
He has close to 30 records for the Bengals, many of them in rushing.
I didn't know that - I need to brush up on my Bengals stats!
