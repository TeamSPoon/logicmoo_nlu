What kind of music do you like?
I prefer older music and some rock. What about you?
I like hiphop and rap, some old stuff is good too.
What's you're favorite rapper?
I like Kodak Black, mostly, but I do like old stuff from 2011 like Lil Wayne.
I like Lil' Wayne too, and I only know Kodak Black by one song.
And what is that? I already have an idea.
I've heard that Tunnel Vision song, it's pretty good.
That's what I thought, that is a good song, but it's over played.
Well, I like it surprisingly, even though I don't listen to anything new these days.
So what are some musicians that you like?
As for the older stuff, I like Prince, Michael Jackson, The Cure... and I like AFI as far as rock music goes.
I like Prince and Michael Jackson, haven't listened to them a whole lot, but it's impossible not to know who they are.
Yeah, they're music legends.
So what are some songs you like by Prince or Michael Jackson?
I like Pop Life by Prince and Thriller by Michael Jackson. It's hard to narrow it down to a few specifics though.
I've never heard of that song by Prince, but everyone has heard of Thriller.
I know, it almost makes me not want to like it because it's so mainstream, but I can't help it.
Well, you are talking about the King of Pop, kind of hard not to like his music.
That's very true!
