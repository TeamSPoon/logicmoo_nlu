Are you interested in the new Spiderman movie?
Because of the director, yes.
I think the story line should be good.
What about it makes it good?
We havent seen a superhero flick set when the hero was a kid.
yeah it will definitely be different.
I just cant see how a kid will fight a villain.
Thats the point of the writers.
I hope its good because the franchise has been good.
I think the last spiderman with Tobey Maguire was a bit boring.
I liked it for the most part.
I think it just got stale with the way he acted and such.
All those movies are always pretty interesting if you ask me.
They are to an extent but I just was not a fan of the villain.
Which one?
Topher Grace's character seemed shallow.
They didnt really develop him.
He was supposed to get his own movie.
I think that studio lost the rights to it though
They did and thats why it never got made
