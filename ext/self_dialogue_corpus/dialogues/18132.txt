Do you remember the song from Ghostbusters?
Yeah, the Ghostbusters song?  What's the name of it?
I actually think the name of it is GhostBusters.
Well, that makes sense.
Who released the song?
I think the guy's name was Ray Parker, Jr.
Was he an actor in the movie?
I think he had acted before but not in the movie.
Oh, that always confused me.
Probably because one of the characters was named Ray.
Oh, that makes sense.
Did you know that he was sued for the song?
Really, why?
Huey Lewis said that it sounded too much like one of his songs.
What was the name of the song?
I don't remember, but I think it was something like "I've Got a New Drug."
I think I've heard that.
Do you think it sounded like Ghostbusters?
I never did, but now that you say this, maybe.
So, that's a no.
