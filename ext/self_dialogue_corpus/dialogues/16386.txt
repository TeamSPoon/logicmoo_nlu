Hey, do you want to go see Twenty One Pilots next month?
Yeah, that sounds like fun. I didn't know you were a fan.
Are you serious? I've liked them ever since 2009.
Wow. I didn't realize they'd been around that long.
Well, they didn't really make it big until Blurry Face came out.
I always thought that Blurry Face was their debut album.
A lot of people tend to think that, but it was actually their 4th.
I never knew!
Yup, they'd released 2 self titled albums before that and an album called Vessel.
I'll have to check out their old stuff. So when is the show?
Its on the 23rd.
I wonder if they'll be shooting any videos there.
I haven't hear anything yet, but its totally possible.
I know, they love to have their fans in their videos.
And we'd love to be in one of their videos!
I know that's right!
I hope they have a good opening band.
I'm sure they will, they usually do.
This is very true.
Alrighty, well, let's go order our tickets!
