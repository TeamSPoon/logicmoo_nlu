What was the song 'Hey Jude' about?
That's actually a very interesting story.  There is the actual reason, but many other interpretations.
Can you elaborate for me?
So it was originally written by Paul McCartney, directed at John Lennon's ex-wife and son.
Why did he write a song for Lennon's wife?
He did it to console and comfort her and John's son after John had his affair with Yoko Ono.
Oh that's very nice of him.
It really was.  Though due to the nature of some of the lyrics, John thought the song was for him, while others thought it was about Paul.
That is fascinating.  I guess that's the beauty of music, and the many interpretations it can have.
You're right.  And in this instance, it led to the creation of one of the Beatles' best songs.
