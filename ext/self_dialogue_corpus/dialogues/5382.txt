Have you seen Rogue One that came out a while ago?
Not yet, what is it about?
aren't you afraid of spoiler?
I don't mind that much, I have my own opinions after watching a movie or tv series, so tell me
it's basically fills a gap between empire strikes back and last hope, where princess leila got the death star's design flaw info
oh, that sounds intriguing
yes indeed, I didn't know there are so much to tell between those 2 movies
yeah, does it end well? Did any important character die?
well, I'll leave that for you to find out
fare enough
