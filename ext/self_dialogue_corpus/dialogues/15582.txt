European polyphony arose out of early religious chants
But Other regions of the world also have polyphony.
Yes, but in other regions, it wasn't developed as a part of musical traditions, but as a part of defense mechanism during the human evolution.
And in Europe?
it was explicitly developed out of the monophonic singing. The oldest examples of polyphony are from arond 900 AD.
That's pretty old.
Scolica enchiriadis and Musica enchiriadis. They're music theory books basically.
i guess if we're to find an example of polyphony, a theory book would do it.
Yes, but note, the polyphony must have existed prior to writing of the theory books in order for the theory to be developed sufficiently to be discussed.
The chants.
Precisely, It was highly unusual to sing or make music about anything aother than God up until a certain time frame.
Even then they called vulgar music
Yes, Musica Vulgaris.
So then this theory book, what's in it?
Um, The scolica is mainly a commentary on the content of Musica enchiriadis, while Musica has 19 chapters. and chapters 10-18 deals with making polyphony
What's in chapter 19?
Some stuff the legend of Orpheus. I don't know why.
Because Orpheus is a musical genius according to the myth. .
Huh, how about that. Anyway the European polyphony began prior to the Western Schism. And Avignon which was the seat of the antipope was the center for musica vulagris which influenced religious music significantly.
That's interesting.
