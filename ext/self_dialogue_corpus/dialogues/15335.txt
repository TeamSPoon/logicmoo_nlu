I really dislike Classical Music.
Really? I do not think it is so bad.
I just cannot stand listening to it. I know Bach and Beethoven were the greats but I find it boring.
There is some classical music that is boring but some of it is great!
Those composers were born with that ability.
I do not know how they could compose that music like that. It is amazing.
Yes, Sebastian Bach was actually a church organist for most of his life.
That is interesting. So maybe that explains MASS IN B MINOR, one of his most famous classical songs.
Yes, Toccata and Fugue in D minor were also very well known.
I do not know  a lot about classical music but maybe I should learn.
It would be a great history lesson to learn about the lives about some of these famous composers.
Yes, there was also Handel and Mozart.
I know. Mozart started playing at a very young age.
I have heard that.
I also know that he died in his thirties.
That is very young.
Imagine the music he could have composed if he lived longer.
Was he married?
Yes, he had a wife and two children when he died.
That is too bad. I think I will learn more about Classical Music.
