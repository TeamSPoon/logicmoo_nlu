How are you doing this evening?
Fine, I am just having a debate with my brother.
I know how that goes. What is the debate about?
He thinks Garth Brooks is the best country singer ever.
I see, who do you think it is?
I say it is Kenny Chesney hands down.
That is a tough one to call actually.
Who do you think is right?
Even though it is close, I agree with Kenny Chesney.
Great! He just has so many great songs.
I know, I love The Good Stuff, and Young.
Those are awesome! My favorites are She Thinks My Tractor' s Sexy and Drive.
Those are great as well. Have you heard She's A Big Star?
Yes! I have loved that song for years.
Garth Brooks has some classics as well though.
That is true; I do love The Dance, and The Thunder Rolls.
Those are good ones. His best song however is Friends In Low Places.
I forgot about that one! I like it as well.
See, it is really a tough argument.
Yea it is, but I am still taking Kenny!
