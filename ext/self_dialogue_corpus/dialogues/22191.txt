I'm looking for a good movie to watch!
Any particular genre you are interested in?
Actually yes, comedy. I want to laugh.
Hm, what is a movie you think is funny?
The Hangover is the funniest movie I've ever seen.
Yeah, that is hilarious. So you like raunchy comedy?
Yes, but not just that. I think Elf is hilarious too and that's totally family friendly.
Good call, yeah that is a funny movie. So are you a Will Ferrell fan then?
He has made lots of funny movies.
Yes, I agree, although it's been a while since I've seen one of his that really made me laugh a lot.
Yeah, that is true.
How about Sausage Party?
I actually just saw that. It was OK.
Have you seen the Jump Street movies?
Yep, saw both of them, very funny.
So you might be looking for something a little more obscure?
Yeah, I'd say so. I've seen lots of mainstream comedies. Something under the radar would be good.
You should watch the Inbetweeners movie. It's a sequel to a hilarious British TV show.
Oh yeah, I've heard of that. It's on Netflix. I think I'll check it out.
You won't regret it!
