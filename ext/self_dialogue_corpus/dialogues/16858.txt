Do you like the Smiths?
Maybe. Who are they?
They were an indie British band back in the 80s and 90s.
What's their music like?
They have a unique sound. It's mainly focused on the personality and voice of the singer Morrissey.
He had a great voice?
I love it, but more important was his personality which he expressed in his music.
What was that like?
Hard to describe. He was a voice for lonely misfits, I think.
That sounds depressing.
No, not at all. He also used a lot of wit and humor. And great tunes.
What about the rest of the band?
They had a great guitarist, Johnny Marr.
I love a good guitar solo.
Marr wasn't really into showy solos. He just was really good at creating a unique sound for the Smiths.
OK, what songs would you recommend?
I love This Charming Man. Hand in Glove is also really good.
What about albums?
I love The Queen is Dead, that's great.
Great, thanks!
