When you were growing up did you have a favorite song?
I really liked "Creep" by Radiohead.
Oh really.  Why?
Well, it's a beautiful song.  Once I was driving at night, and parked the car, and I stayed in the car so I could listen to all of it.
Do you still like the song now?
Yes, I like Radiohead, but I haven't really heard a lot of their new stuff.
I haven't either.
Did you have a favorite song?
I always liked the Beatles.
The early works or later songs?
I kind of liked all of it.  It is interesting how their style changed as they matured, had more creative control and the world around them changed.
Yes, the 60s and 70s were and interesting time.
Did you know that Yoko Ono is now going to get writing credit for the song "Imagine"?
Really?
Yes, apparently John Lennon said that he was inspired by one of her poems when writing that song.
It's sad that John Lennon had his life cut short.
Yes, apparently when they made a movie about it, there was an actor who had the same name as his killer and Yoko Ono refused to allow him to be in the movie.
It must be very painful to lose a loved one that way.
There are some crazy people out there.
You are absolutely correct.
