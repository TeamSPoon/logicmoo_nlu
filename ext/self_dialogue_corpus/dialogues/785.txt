What NFL team is your favorite?
The New Orleans Saints
Never really been a big Saints fan.
What team is your favorite?
I'm from San Diego so I've been a Chargers fan my entire life.
How do you feel about the Chargers moving to Los Angeles?
Man I hate it, it really pisses me off how easily an NFL team can be rooted away from a city.
Yeah but the NFL is in it for the money. They really could care less about their fans.
Oh you're 100% correct. Look what happened to the St. Louis Rams and the Oakland Raiders.
I actually feel pretty bad for Raiders fans, they have a very loyal fan base.
Yup but at the same time it's pretty cool Las Vegas is getting a NFL team.
I guess so but I think fans should have a voice in these type of decesions.
Weren't the Saints about to move cities a few years ago.
Mhm rite after Hurricane Katrina.
What happened with that?
Basically the owner Tom Benson wanted to move the team to San Antonio after the hurricane unless certain demands were met.
What demands did Benson have?
He wanted the Superdome to undergo some serious renovantions and wanted a high tech new practice facility built for the team.
Well I'm assuming he got what he wanted.
He sure did and I'm very satisified with all the upgrades in the Superdome.
