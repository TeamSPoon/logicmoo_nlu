I like the Kinks how about you?
You mean that Bristish band from the 1970s and 1980s?
That's the one they have the coolest songs.
I think I know what you mean.
The Greatest Hits album I have I can listen to the whole thing and like every song.
They were actually started in the 1960s I think but got more popular after.
I did not know that.
You Really Got Me was the biggest chart topper I think.
They were part of the British band invasion of the US.
Yes, they were.
I kind of like Wish I Could Fly Like Superman.
I like that song too it is hilarious.
The one about the sister Come Dancing gets to me.
I like that song.
Catch me Now I'm falling is good with the Captain America reference.
They seem to have a thing for Superheroes in their songs.
I like Living on a Thin Line and Celluloid Heroes too.
We liked the Father Christmas song when we were kids.
In our neighborhood we would rather have the money too.
That is funny.
