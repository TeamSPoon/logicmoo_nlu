Have you ever seen Super Size Me?
What's that?
It was a documentary.
Was that the one where the man ate all that food?
Yeah, he ate at McDonald's for a month.
Didn't he gain a lot of weight?
Supposedly he did.
What do you mean supposedly?
Well, I guess he did lose the weight, but there is controversy about the movie.
What was controversial about it?
Well, another guy ate at McDonald's everyday and lost weight.
How did he do that?
It was all about making healthier choices.
You can't really eat healthy at McDonald's.
Maybe not healthy.  But you can be moderate.
So the second guy proved what exactly.
More or less, that you won't gain a ton just by eating at McDonald's.
Oh, so he was telling the viewers it was their responsiblity to order responsibly?
Pretty much.
Well, that makes a lot of sense.
