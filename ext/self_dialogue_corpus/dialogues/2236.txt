Which Super Bowl do you remember the most?
Probably Super Bowl XXII?
Really, why do you say that?
It was one of the biggest scoring quarters of all time?
Who played in that one?
Broncos and Redskins.
Oh yeah, that's the one where Denver opened with a lead.
Yep, and then were crushed in the 2nd quarter.
Right, 35 points.
And then they scored another 7 in the 4th to ice the game.
Man, did Denver score again.
Nope, 10 points in the first quarter and that was it.
Wow, 2nd straight loss for John Elway?
Yes, and Dan Reeves.
Yeah, Reeves never one the big one.
Nope. Went multiple times, but could never pull of a win.
How embarrassing
Well, not as embarrassing as the Bills.
Oh yeah, that was horrible.
Yep.
