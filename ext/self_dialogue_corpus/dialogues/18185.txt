I really hate it when a show comes out on DVD and they had to change some of the music.
I know, right! I get that it's a rights thing or a way to save money, but sometimes music make a scene.
Exactly. Honestly I discover a lot of new music from TV shows.
Me too. No wonder some shows put out soundtracks.
I think the first time I heard that Kaleo song was on Supergirl.
And then of course an old song can get a bump from being in an important scene.
Oh, man. 'Don't Stop Believing' fits that majorly.
Yes, the Sopranos! Although now people probably associate it with Glee too.
Oh, right.
Bohemian Rhapsody!
Yeah, I think that one wins the prize. Waynes World made that song, even if it wasn't new.
Absolutely. Those are the big ones.
But there have been smaller moments for me too. Like 'Ventura Highway' when Logan is beaten on Veronica Mars.
That was really powerful. Or like when 'Cathedrals' by Jump Little Children was playing as Colin's surgery was performed on Everwood.
I probably never would have heard that song if not for that scene.
TV and film really is a great way to discover new music.
Or even covers of old music.
You're so right. I once heard a slowed down version of 'You're the One that I Want' on the show Parenthood.
I can't really imagine that.
It was actually pretty good. It was a whole new take on the song.
