Have you listened to Ru Paul's new album?
I didn't know he came out with a new album!
yeah I think he does almost every year.
His music is so catchy.
I love dancing to it!
He really puts on a great show.
I wonder if he sings in drag.
I can't imagine that would be comfortable.
I always like the Sissy That Walk song.
Yeah that's one of my favorites too.
It sounds like 90's dance music.
I think Ru Paul loves to play music like that.
She comes from that era.
I wonder if she'll continue to make music.
I think she will for quite a while.
I like when they play the songs in the club.
I do too. They're great for dancing and socializing.
And her music spreads such a positive message to viewers.
She really is an inspiration to others.
She helps me get through tough days.
