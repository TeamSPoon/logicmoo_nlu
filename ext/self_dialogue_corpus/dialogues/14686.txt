Did the Spurs just gifted game 1 to the Warriors?
Oh yeah. They did. Wow!
Stephen Curry is on fire!
Very clutch in the 4th.
Lakers are hoping to get the No. 1 pick.
I hope they do. Can't stand not being in the playoffs.
Lets all laugh at the Clippers!
One and done again!
The real story is Kawhi Leonard.
If he's out then the Spurs are done.
Will Blake Griffin sign with the Thunder?
I don't know but him and Westbrook could be deadly combination to face.
If Lebron doesn't win this ring then he's not one of the greatest to play the game.
Seriously, all the great one's are retired or past their prime. It's open season for championship rings.
Carmelo is a joke.
I want him out of my Knicks. He's done nohting!
How i miss seeing Kobe play.
The game is just not the same anymore.
Did you watch this week's Shaqtin' A Fool?
The flop was hilarious.
