Do you like the concept of the Death Star in Star Wars?
I do actually.
I was wondering if you thought it was practical like it could be actually done?
I think a weapon could be created like that but not in the same way.
How so?
I don't think we could ever create a weapon that is essentially a planet/moon just would require hundreds of years, that's a lot of space to use and build something that large inside of it.
That's a good point.
Do you think it was a cool concept?
I absolutely loved the idea and it was rather shocking.
Yeah it was a big twist.
