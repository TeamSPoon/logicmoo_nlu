You've seen 2 Fast 2 Furious right?
Yes I have it was one of my favorites.
Do you remember the scene with the yacht?
I don't recall that one.
Oh man, that was an awesome scene especially where the Yacht is escaping and Brian jumped the car onto the Yacht.
That's right, that scene was absolutely epic.
Wasn't Roman with him in the car?
I believe so.
I just remember someone screaming and that must have been Roman.
Yes it was.
