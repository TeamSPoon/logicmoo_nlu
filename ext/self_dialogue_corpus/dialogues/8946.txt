I am feeling wacky today.
Do you want to hear some wacky music?
Absolutely. What do you have for me?
Check out the band Primus.
Primus. What a weird and wacky name!
That is the point! You need to listen to them.
What is a good album by them?
Frizzle Fry is great. Check it out.
That name is so cool! I want to hear them now!
Do it. Buy the album or find somewhere online and listen.
