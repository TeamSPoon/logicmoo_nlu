What is the best run NFL franchise, would you say?
Gotta go with New England.
Can't really argue with their success in the Belichek/Brady Era.
Nope, they're the gold standard.
I have two reservations there.
Oh, what are they?
Number one is the cheating stuff.
Ahh, a lot of that is overblown.
Deflate -Gate was definitely ridiculous, but Spy-Gate was real.
It was pretty bad. But I still say that doesn't disqualify them.
My other issue is that it seems like all their success is due to coach and star quarterback.
So what? They still won the games!
Yeah, but that doesn't necessarily mean the whole organization is strong.
OK, then what team would you pick?
I'd go with the Steelers.
Yeah, they're hanging with New England in terms of rings.
Rings, but also sustained success.
Yeah, they've won with multiple coaches and quarterbacks.
Exactly. I think their ownership structure really knows how to run a winner.
Can't really go wrong with either team!
