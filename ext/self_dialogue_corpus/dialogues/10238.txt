My favorite Bruce Willis movie is Die Hard.
Man, I loved that movie when I was a kid.
Oh, yeah, I thought he was so tough.  I wanted to be like him.
I don't blame you.  He set a standard.
Alan Rickman was a formidable villain, too.
Yes, I thought they worked well together onscreen.
There were lots of cool sequences in that film.
There sure were.  I think a lot of films copied its style.
I thought it was cool that it was set during Christmas, too.
Me, too.  I watch it every Christmas!
