Did you see the forty year anniversary of Saturday night fever.
Yes I did.
Barry Gibb was there.
I saw that.
Bee gees had like two careers.
I know.
One before disco and one with disco.
A great career.
I started a joke,words,Massachusetts.
Real classic songs.
Just three brothers.
Three brothers with great and unique voices.
That's for sure.
There was actually four brothers.
Right,Andy was the youngest.
He tragically died too.
They've had their share of misery.
Yes they have.
To rock in the sixties and then dominate the disco scene was something.
What an accomplishment
