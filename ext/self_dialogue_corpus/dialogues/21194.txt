What genre of movies do you like?
Comedies mostly, but some action and drama.  How about you?
I only watch comedy shows.  What's your favorite comedy?
That's tough.  Probably Step-brothers or Talladega Nights
Oh wow!  Those are two of my favorites too!
I like Will Ferrell a lot.
Yes, me too.  His style of comedy is right up my alley.
I can't really think of a movie of his I didn't like except maybe the one about time travel
What's the name of that one?
I can't remember right now.
Tell me more about the plot.
Will's character is a scientist that falls back in time with his apprentice and they meet aliens and stuff.
That doesn't sound familiar at all.  It's a comedy though?
Yes, well.... supposedly anyway.  It really wasn't too funny.
I need to go Google that one and see what it is.
It has a lot of dinosaurs in it at first, but there's aliens toward the end.
I just can't place that all.  It's driving me crazy.
It kind of has a "planet of the apes" feel to it, but that's not what it's really about.
Oh!  I think I kind of remember the ads for that one.  I didn't see it though.
I wouldn't really bother.  It certainly wasn't his best work.
