What groups do you think began the heavy metal genre of music?
That's a matter of great dispute!
What do you mean?
No one really knows. It kind of just happened.
Still, there are pioneers for every genre of music.
True. Steppenwolf is probably responsible for the genre.
How so?
The lyrics to "Born To Be Wild" include the phrase "heavy metal".
I see. But, I'm more interested in the groups responsible.
The Yardbirds would be a good place to start.
Why's that?
At one point, several of the early heavy metal guitarists were in the group.
Who's that?
There was Eric Clapton, Jimmie Page, and Jeff Beck at different points.
Wow, that's amazing!
Definitely. But the group most responsible is probably Black Sabbath.
That makes sense. Ozzie is certainly a pioneer.
And, we can't forget Jimmie Page's next band -- Led Zeppelin.
For sure! What about the heavy metal look. I mean the fashion.
That's an easy one. It's all Judas Priest. Although, Kiss and their makeup also played a big role in music fashion.
