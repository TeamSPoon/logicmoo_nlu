Have you watched any good movies recently?
Nah, I've been too busy. What have you seen that you think is good?
Well, I just watched "The Big Short" last night.
Oh yeah? Who's in that?
Tons of people. Brad Pitt, Steve Carrell, Ryan Gosling...lots of people you'd recognize.
Okay, that sounds promising. But it is funny? Steve Carrell, he's usually a comedian, right?
Oh, it's definitely not a comedy.
Well, what *is* it about?
It's about the collapse of the housing market back in 2007-2008.
Sounds kind of boring. I barely remember that.
I know, that's kind of the point of the movie, actually.
What, that it's boring?
Well, the movie's not boring, but that somehow bankers and everyone else calculate that we're so stupid we can't focus on all these technical details about mortgage stuff.
Oh. Well, they're probably right about that.
Yeah, but the movie keeps doing this funny thing where it brings in stars to "explain" stuff to us as we watch the movie.
Like, it's not part of the actual plot?
Yeah, kind of. Like the camera just cuts to Margot Robbie in a hot tub, explaining mortgage stuff while she drinks champagne.
Sounds weird, but awesome...
Yeah, I actually think you'd really like it. But it's kind of dark. The bad guys kind of win, sort of. But it's a true story!
Okay, I will give it a try!
