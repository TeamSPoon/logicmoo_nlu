What is a song that you really like, but you think is too long?
I'd have to say anything by Pink Floyd.
Haha, they did write some long songs. But is there any one that sticks out in your mind?
I'd say 'Dogs' from their 'Animals' album.
I actually really like that song.
Yeah, I do too. But it's just too long.
I see, I can understand that.
Maybe it's the fact that I'm more lyrics oriented.
If that's the case, then some of those interludes between lyrics must bother you.
Definitely. It's always been that way for me with music.
For me, the lyrics usually don't matter much.
I can't identify with that - the lyrics are what the song is about!
Not necessarily. Sometimes the music speaks for itself moreso than the lyrics.
Not to me!
Well, then you're missing out on some beautiful and meaningful music.
Fortunately, there's enough music out there for both people like me and people like you.
True. Although I'm not saying I don't like lyrics.
You're just more diverse in your musical appreciation than me, is what I'm seeing.
I wouldn't say it like that.
No, I think it's probably true, and it's OK. As long as there's stuff I like, I'm fine with some people having a wider range of enjoyment.
