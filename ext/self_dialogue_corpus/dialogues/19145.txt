Slipknot is one of my favorite metal bands.
They had some pretty good songs back in the day.
Yeah. My favorite album of theirs is Iowa.
My favorite album is Vol 3: The Subliminal Verses.
I really like that one, too.
Have you heard their newest album .5: The Gray Chapter?
Yeah, but I didn't like it as much as their older albums.
I know. I was so disappointed with All Hope Is Gone.
The only song I liked from that album was Psychosocial.
I didn't even like that song.
Yeah, it wasn't as gritty as their older music.
What other metal bands do you like?
Well, I really like the genre kawaii metal.
What is that?
It's like a mixture of japanese pop and metal.
It sounds interesting.
If you're really interested in it, you should check out Babymetal.
Any songs I should look out for?
I would definitely recommend their songs Gimme Chocolate!! and Karate.
Okay, I'll check them out.
