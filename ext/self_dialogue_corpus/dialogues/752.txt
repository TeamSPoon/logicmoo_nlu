What do you think of the rule changes the NFL has made?
I like some of them, but not all of them.
Which ones don't you like?
I don't like how you can't hit a quarterback anymore.
Yeah but they are trying to protect them.
I get that, but it's football.  They are gonna get hit.
Well the NFL is scared about getting sued for concussions.
That's a lawsuit they won't win.
Why don't you think the NFL will win?
There has been evidence for years the football causes concussions.
I still think the players know the risk.
They do know the risk, but it's because the NFL tried to cover up concussion that will get them in trouble.
Would you let your kid play football?
No, there are too many other safer sports.
Oh come on.  Football makes men out of boys.
I agree it's a tough sport but I'd rather my kid play basketball or baseball than football.
How many NFL players get concussions?
Almost all of them at one point in their career.
I guess that is a good point.
NFL football isn't ballet.  It's a dangerous sport.
