Why did Harper not get a longer deal?
It is shocking cant see him being a Nat for too long.
I mean Trout got his deal right away.
Thats why I think hes done quicker than we think.
Can you see him signing elsewhere?
New York is probably going to run to him
I thought the Yankees were done with that stuff.
They are but for generational talents theyll line up
So the Yankees are his landing spot.
Unless washington does something
If you are him, are you signing with them?
No I would not. They dont show faith in him.
Could he demand a trade
No because that doesnt solve his contract issue.
So the ill will the Nats are showing him will cost them?
Yes in 2 ways
Which are?
They are going to have to overpay for him and they may have to trade him
Man he holds all the cards in this one
I just think he deserves a much bigger deal than the one year extensions he keeps getting.
