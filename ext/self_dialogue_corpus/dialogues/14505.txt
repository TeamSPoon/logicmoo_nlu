The Hawks organization is influx
Yeah they really are. Where do they go from here?
Milsap is got to be their top priority
Indeed. He is their best player
Yeah. I also like that kid Schroeder. He is going to be a superstar in this league
I don't know about superstar, but he will be a very good player
They need a couple of more pieces though
Yeah I agree with you. They have to add some shooters
Yeah, especially since they gave up Kyle Korver
I didn't understand that move at all
That's what I'm saying this organization didn't know whether to blow this team up or to try and win games
They went out and got Dwight Howard last year, I'm sure he doesn't want to be a part of a rebuilding project.
Exactly. When Howard's not happy he can taint a locker room
Yeah he's done that before. This is not a good look for the Hawks organization
It really isn't. No way any team takes on that massive Howard contract though.
I have to agree with you on that one. They are going to have to work around him.
At least he is still pretty good defensively. He still can defend the paint and he's a good rebounder
Yeah he is, but you can't go to him in the post
No you can't be he's been like that for a while now
Yeah, so they knew that when they signed him.
