Hey, what's your favorite Major League Baseball team?
I'm from Boston, so I love the Red Sox.
Me too! Did you watch last night's game?
Sure did. I'm glad they finally beat the Yankees.
They're still third in the division, but it's going to be close all year.
Yeah, it's a good thing the season is so long. Who's starting the game tomorrow?
I think Chris Sale is pitching tomorrow.
Perfect, he's the best pitcher in the league right now.
He is, and the batting lineup is starting to get hot as well.
I know, can you believe that home-run that Mookie Betts hit?
The ball must have went over 400 feet. Did it go out of the park?
I think it did. What an incredible hit.
Did you see the stolen base in the 6th inning?
I did! I wasn't sure it was possible for a person to run that fast.
Have you ever been to Fenway Park for a game?
No, but I'd definitely like to visit there, because it's one of the oldest stadiums in the league.
I went to a playoff game last year. I hope the Red Sox make the playoffs this year.
Me too, and I especially hope that the Yankees don't make the playoffs.
Here's my number, let's meet up to watch tomorrow night's game together?
Thanks, I think the game's at 7. Go Red Sox!
