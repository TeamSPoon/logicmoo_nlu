I was outside eating and somebody drove by sharing their music pretty loudly.
Was it any good?
Honestly I couldn't tell, it just sounded like a lot of toneless screaming.
Screamo music?
I think it was some kind of metal.
Oh I love metal! Especially melodic folk metal.
That sounds... oddly specific.
I mean I like all kinds of metal, that just happens to be my favourite.
I could never get into metal personally.
Well it's not for everyone. Did you at least give it a chance?
Yeah, it just all sounds kind of stressful to me. I don't know how you could listen to it and relax.
It helps when you understand the lyrics and the sentiment and don't just look at the surface of "hey, it's loud and clashy".
I'm sure there's a lot of cheerful metal out there.
There really is. I mean, the number of songs that have "victory" in the title alone...
Hmm, well I can never understand what they're talking about in the songs anyway.
That's why you read the lyrics beforehand, my friend.
I also don't feel like I could ever sing along to it.
You don't have to. You can growl and scream along to it.
That sounds like it would give me a sore throat.
I've never tried to myself.
