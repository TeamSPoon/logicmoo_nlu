Have you heard the new Gorillaz album, "Humanz"?
Yes, it's great.  I love Damon Albarn's voice.
And how cool that D.R.A.M. and Anthony Hamilton are part of it.
Yeah, and De la Soul.
Yes. I think so many people have been waiting for this album to come out.
I think it's really political.  More political than it seems.
I think it's kind of a reaction to the current world political climate, don't you?
Yes.  And the making of the album for them is always such a cool, creative process.  You could watch it on their instagram.
I had no idea.  I had heard about the photo of Damon's floor being covered with the splices of Grace Jones' singing.
Yeah, and he picked the best ones to create "Charger", which is such an awesome song.
I heard he was going to work with Liam Bailey, too, but he's not on the album.
I think they did record together, but that song or songs didn't make it to the album.
Did you know that "Andromeda" was written about Damon Albarn's girlfriend's mother?  She had just died when they started making the album.
I didn't know that.  Is his girlfriend someone famous?
Not a musician, but she's a painter.  I think she might be famous in the U.K.
Cool.  I heard that "Andromeda" was kind of inspired by the sound of Michael Jackson's "Thriller" album.
Yeah, and some 80's Hall and Oates song, too, "I Can't Go For That."
I'm not a big Hall and Oates fan
I like their 70's music.
"She's Gone" is an all right tune.
