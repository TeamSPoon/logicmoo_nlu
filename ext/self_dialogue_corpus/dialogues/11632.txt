What do you think is the most popular Beatles song?
It's either Hey Jude or I Want to Hold Your Hand.
I think their later stuff is much better than their earlier stuff.
I agree; Abbey Road is my favorite album even though has some short unfinished songs.
I'm glad that Abbey Road is their last album because Let it Be was a bit of a downer for me.
I love the song Let it Be, but that's about all from that album.
Can you imagine what it would have been like though to see them on the rooftop performing?
Much better than seeing them in Shea Stadium where you could not even hear them sing.
Who did you prefer as a singer in the Beatles?
Honestly, I preferred John.  I like his more rocking voice.
