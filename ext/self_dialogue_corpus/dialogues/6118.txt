It looks like they're making a live action version of Disney's The Little Mermaid.
That should be interesting to see. I wonder how they'll create the "under the sea" look.
Not sure, but I hope they keep it pretty true to the original, not like the upcoming remake of Mulan.
I don't know how I feel about this, though. The live shows they've been doing on TV of musicals haven't been that great.
I am hoping that, at the very least, I can enjoy the music.
I wonder if they'll add any new songs.
Like in the new Beauty and the Beast?
Yes, that would be awesome! Maybe have Eric sing something.
I wonder if the animals will be puppets or animated?
I don't know, but it will be interesting to see how they do Ursula!
