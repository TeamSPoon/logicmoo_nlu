Note to self: Never watch the Exorcist alone at night ever again.
Wow. That movie gave me nightmares.
You have to come see IT with me when it comes out.
No way! You know how much i hate clowns.
Is the Conjuring sequel any good?
Its almost as good as the first one.
Is Ghostbusters considered a horror movie?
I think it does because it does deal with ghosts.
Well I'm not going to the beach anymore.
Let me guess, you finally saw Jaws.
