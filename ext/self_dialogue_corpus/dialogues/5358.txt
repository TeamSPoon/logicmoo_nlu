Beauty and the Beast is such a good movie, have you seen the new version/
NO  but I would like to, but nothing can beat the cartoon
I was always worried the rose would die too soon and the curse would never be broken
I know, I can't imagine living my life as a beast
some people say she had a syndrome where she wanted to stay with the person who captured her
I have heard that theory, a lot of Disney movies have dark undertones
this one really did  and Gaston was terrible, I think he was a bad man
and Belle always seemed like she had no idea what was going on
I know, she should have been more careful
she really should have, she really upset her poor little dad
