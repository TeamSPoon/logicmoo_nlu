Have seen that one horror thriller type movie called The Gallows?
Yeah I saw that one. It's about a boy named Charlie who accidentally got hung in a school play.
Yeah it was a really creepy movie. It has an indie feel to it as well from the way they filmed it.
I know. I loved the way the suspense keeps you on the edge of your seat.
Also one of the Actresses is Kathy Lee Gifford's daughter. Her name is Cassidy.
I didn't know that. I did think it was interesting all the actors had the same first name as their characters as in real life.
I think I want to buy the movie for sure.
I would definitely get it. The directors were amazing at making this film.
Yeah Travis Cluff and Chris Lofing both directed and wrote the story.
I look forward to seeing more movies about these guys or even a sequel.
