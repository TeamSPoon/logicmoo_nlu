What do you think of Springsteens music?
You do mean the Boss right?
Yes, I guess you could call him that.
He has so many great songs.
Yes and can still rock at his age.
Isn't he in his late sixties?
Yes, he is. Amazing how he still performs.
I guess doing what you love helps.
Yes, well I'm sure the money doesn't hurt.
My favorite song is Thunder Road.
I like Born in the USA.
Doesn't everybody?
He is in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.
Well he should be.
I saw him in concert about four times.
Really, I only saw him once.
He plays like forever.
Yes, it was over two hours when I saw him.
Me too. I guess he gives you your moneys worth.
Well the price of the tickets are outrageous.
