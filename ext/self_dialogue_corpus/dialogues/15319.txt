What is your favorite band from California?
Tough question. But I think I would have to go with Blink-182
Good answer! They are definitely amongst my favorites as well.
Who is your favorite member of the band?
I would probably say that my favorite member is Mark Hoppus.
Interesting. I don't agree. I like another member better.
Which member is your favorite?
Travis Barker.
That is not a bad choice. He is a great musician.
He is one of the most talented drummers I have ever heard.
He is very fashionable too, right?
Yes, he wears unique clothing and has many tattoos.
Didn't he get in a plane crash years ago?
He certainly did. He almost died!
Thank god he did not. That would have been a tragedy.
It is tough for him to travel now though. He only goes by bus I think.
So does the band still tour?
They absolutely do. But they leave time for him to travel by ground transportation.
I'm glad that the rest of the band understands and is ok with that.
Me too! I can only imagine how terrifying it would be to get on a plane again after being in such a horrible crash.
