Hey, you! With the feet attached to legs! You like Bowie?
He's alright I guess. Why are you bothering me?
What's your song? I need to know NOW.
I don't know. I don't have one. I like Bob Seger. I really like "Against the Wind".
Really? Here's a question for you: name his first Top 40 song. I'll give you help. It wasn't recorded with the Silver Bullet Band but with an earlier group--Bobby S. and the Fancy Boys.
Get the heck outta here. No such thing. And I mean it, get out of here.
So a Seger dude, huh? Then you must like Canned Heat too, am I right? Gooooing up to country blahie blah blah blah....
Oooh, look at the time and there's my bus and I think my wife's water just broke. I gotta go.
Listen to the Bowie! Listen, I say, listen!
He's dead! Get over it!
