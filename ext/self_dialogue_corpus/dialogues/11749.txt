So, my husband doesn't like the Beatles!
What? How is that possible?
I don't know, I think he says it just to get me going.  He knows I love the Beatles, especially John.
I prefer Paul, but together they wrote some amazing songs.
I agree, I enjoy tribute bands, but I really wish that they were all still alive so they could do a reunion tour.
That would be AMAZING!!  If they would even do that, they stopped touring early in their career.
Oh, that's right.  I remember hearing that.
What is your favorite Beatles song?
That is a tough question, I love the well known ones, but Rocky Racoon always make me smile!
Oh yes, that one is good.  I think Something is my favorite, but then I will hear Eleanor Rigby, and that could be my favorite.
