Have you ever head of the movie Bolt that Disney made?
That's the one about the dog who thinks it really has super powers but is just an actor for a show right?
Yup that movie.
Yeah I have and I have seen it too. It was alright.
It seems to be one of the less known movies they did I think.
True I never really heard much about it even when it first came out.
Still I feel like it was a good movie and John Travolta did a good job for the voice.
Yeah he was a good choice.
I think what made the movie the best was the banter between Bolt, Rhino and Mittens.
Yes, those guys antics were hilarious especially Rhinos.
