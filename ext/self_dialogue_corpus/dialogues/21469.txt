Do you remember the romantic comedy Just Friends from 2005?
The one with Ryan Reynolds, right? You know, I never saw that!
I rewatched it over the weekend, and I realized how different gender portrayals have become!
Feminism hadn't really hit the cinematic mainstream back then in 2005...
I mean, it's not so long ago, but things were so different! The humor isn't really that funny.
I thought the same thing when I saw 50 First Dates. I remember that being hilarious....
But in hindsight? Sexism and gay jokes just make you cringe.
Exactly! So what did you see in Just Friends?
Well, the Anna Farris character is so flat. Just a silly, whiny, superficial woman.
All the women in those movies were definitely seen through the male's eyes.
The male gaze is definitely a thing! It's all about how they appeal to the men.
And what's funny to the men. I think women in today's TV and movies are much more interesting.
I agree. Like they could be real people! And studios know better now than to use women as cheap laughs.
It helps bringing more women into the production process. Like Wonder Woman!
A female director making such a female-oriented movie? We're moving into the 21st century!
And the box office numbers are showing that type of movie appeals to more than just women.
Men might want to know what women really think? Who knew?
Representation matters so much--at every point of filmmaking.
I agree. But how about representation with women of color?
Still got a ways to go in some areas. Let's make a movie?
