Do you like the first set of Star Wars movies, or the recent ones best?
The first set, because they had better story lines.
Yes, me too.  I think there was a lot better development of the characters.
The element of using "The Force" was way cool, too.
It was almost kind of like what passes for religious beliefs these days.
Yeah, in the older movies they treated it that way, but in the newer movies they treat it more like they are a police force rather than a religion.
There were better action scenes, even without the improved special effects they have today.
There was nothing like it back then, they were way ahead of their time.
Well, I guess it's true, can't beat old school storytelling.
Yeah, these days it's like all they can come up with is remakes, nothing original any more like the original Star Wars!
