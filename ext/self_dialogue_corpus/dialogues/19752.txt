Ready for the concert?
I told you, I'm NOT going. It's not music.
Don't be a snob, it totally is.
John Cage's 4'33" is NOT music.
Why not?
It's literally some idiot at a piano sitting still for 7 minutes.
Yeah, the music is what's created by the audience and random sound throughout.
No, music is organized. This is random and disorganized.
I didn't know you defined music for everyone.
I didn't--that's the general definition.
Why don't you like Cage?
He gets credit for nothing. And performers put it on their resume without doing anything.
But he came up with the idea, so he deserves it.
But how can you pay money to hear what you can hear at home for free?
It's the experience. This is art, you grump.
I'll go on one condition.
Sure, what's that?
I eat fiber and protein bars, broccoli, and beans beforehand.
Don't ruin it.
Then I'm not going. Farts can be musical.
