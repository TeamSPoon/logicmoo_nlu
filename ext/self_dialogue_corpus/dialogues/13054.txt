Have you seen any of the Clone Wars series?
Yes, I have seen most of them but not the last season.
Oh nice, are you planning on finishing it?
I want to, I just haven't found the time.
You should! The animation and production quality of that show got better and better each season.
I agree, it was a really well made show.
By the time they got to the sixth season it was a master piece of animation.
What is your favorite episode?
I have to say if I had to pick one it would be the one where Ashoka gets framed for killing the prisoner and the council disowns her.
I loved that episode too, I think there were several about that part of the story.
