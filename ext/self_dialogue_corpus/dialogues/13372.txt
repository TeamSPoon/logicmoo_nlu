Can't wait to see the next Star Wars installment.
Yeah it looks like it'll be good. What's the name of it again?
It's called Star Wars: The Last Jedi.
Wow with a name like that you can expect something crazy to happen.
Some people think that Luke Skywalker is the Last Jedi.
Maybe he is planning on starting something totally separate from the Jedi and Sith.
That would make a lot of sense since they said he was the one to bring balance to the force.
He could start a new group that will utilize both the light and dark side of the force.
Maybe Rey is the missing key to it all.
Daisy Ridley is awesome as Rey. I can't wait to see what she has in store for us.
