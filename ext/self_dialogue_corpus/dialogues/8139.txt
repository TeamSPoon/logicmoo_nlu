Did you know that the song Irreplaceable by Beyonce was originally meant for Shania Twain?
What?! How is that possible?
Ne-Yo wrote the song and said he originally wanted it to be a country song.
I can't even imagine it as one.
He said he had Faith Hill or Shania Twain in mind as he was writing it.
That seems pretty crazy.
Beyonce did a great job with it though, I am glad she was the one who performed it.
Me too, but now I kind of wish someone would record a country version of it.
Maybe there is one on Youtube.
I'm sure there is one somewhere.
