You ever listen to the Beatles?
Off and on.
It's incredible how much music they had, right?
Yeah, and they weren't really active that long.
I know.  They were together not even ten years.
Yeah, well popular that long at least.
In America they became famous in 63 and broke up in the late 60s.
In 69 I think.
Yeah, that sounds right.
I can't believe they never got back together.
