are we still meeting at the snap bar today?
not really,we might have to change venue and meet at rasper instead
oh, why the change?
i reckon today is raggae night at snap bar and you know i don't really dig raggae music not when it even then had to be what i would listen to all  night.
i don't as well though, raspar does plays pop music and a mix up from genre.
yeah,reason why i thought we should rather do rasper.
that's ok.
oh talking about raggae, dancehall king sean paul new video just came up now on mtv,sounding really groovy.
are you talking about "whyne for me".
yes that's the tittle
oh the song isdoing really great i must say,its like the lastest dancehall anthem.
i'm sure the dj at rasper might bump it today.
i suppose so, its trendy and beside its very groovy .
that's true.
please don't forget to come with the "little mix" album you'd wanted me to listen to
sure right i won't.
oh great mate.
let me go freshen up and start getting ready
alright mate no worries
see you soon,
