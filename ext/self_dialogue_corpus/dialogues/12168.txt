Whats your favorite Star Wars movie character?
I like Darth Vader he is just so cool
Yeah he is a great villain, hes scary.
Whose your favorite character?
I like Han Solo I think hes pretty cool.
Yeah, too bad he died in the last Star Wars movie.
Yeah its a shame but I heard Disney is planing a Han Solo movie.
That would be awesome I wonder how this movie will play out.
I think its the beggining, how he became the Han Solo we all love.
That sounds like a must see.
