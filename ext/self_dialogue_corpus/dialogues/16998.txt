What type of music do you like?
I like a lot of different genres.  It depends on my mood.
What is your favorite type of music to listen to while you are working?
I like to put it on pandora and just let my radio station play.
I do that too.  You don't have to think about which song to play.
Exactly.  There are some times that I want to hear a specific song.
I use spotify for that.
Yes, that's what I was going to say.
I like all types of music.  Country, some rap, bluegrass...
I don't like country music, but I'm open to almost anything else.
I grew up in the South; I think that's why I like country.
That makes sense!
I am a big fan of the classics too.  Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd...
I am too.  I can always listen to those bands.
I don't care much for pop, I guess
Like Justin Bieber?  Or Ariana Grande?
Yeah, I don't listen to their music at all.
No, I don't either.  I don't identify with them at all.
Maybe we're too old to understand their music.
Maybe.  I think I'm ok with that though.
