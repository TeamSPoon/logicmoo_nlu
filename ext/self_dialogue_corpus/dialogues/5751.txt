monsters inc. was so good!
true. and they easily had one of the best sequels!
do you think it's because it was a prequel?
maybe! either way, i loved seeing their college years
it was so cool to see how their dynamic was set up over the years
yeah, the friendship aspect of the movie is so cool and important!
it really is, though
i weirdly kind of like randall
that is weird. he's the villain, he sucks!
but he sucks so well...
