So, which team will you be rooting this NFL season?
I think I will be cheering on the Oakland Raiders.
Jalen Richard might help be a big help with for the Raiders this season.
Yeah, he was good last year for the Raiders.
I am hoping that the Seattle Seahawks do great this season.
They have the some of the best defense of any team.
I just hope Jimmy Graham can stay healthy this season.
Yep, I think he tore a tendon in the 2015 season.
But Graham came back stronger in the 2016 season.
It was miracle the injury was not made worse.
It was crazy how fast Graham was able to bounce back.
I think he was just very determine to make a fast recovery.
It's good that Russell Wilson was not hurt that season.
Having both him and Jimmy Graham playing together that season was great.
Did you know Andrew Luck might still be on the injured list?
Yep, he's the quarterback for the Colts.
I heard he was trying to make a full recovery to start this season.
So, is Dolphins center Mike Pouncey.
I didn't know Pouncey was in recovery mode.
I just found out three days ago.
