What is your favorite Beatles guitar riff?
I always thought that George Harrison was great in Love Me Do and a Hard Day's night.
Yes, George's guitar playing was underrated.
I was always glad that Paul McCartney got to do Yesterday solo.
True, but it is nice when they have a string section backing Paul up.
I think their version of Please Mr. Postman is such a great 60's song.
Yeah, much better than the covers that came later.
Did you ever see the Beatles play live?
No, but my Mom did.  I've seen some tribute bands.
Those are OK, but I would rather see Paul play live.
