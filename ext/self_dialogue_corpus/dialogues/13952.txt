I just recently started to get into Lady Gaga's music.
She has a lot of really good music.
I think her videos are really different.
Paparazzi is pretty weird.
Not one for kids to see.
I really like Poker Face is good and she looks really good in the video.
I think one of her strangest songs is Born This Way. have you seen the video to that one?
That one is pretty out there.
What I like is that she's not afraid to be different.
That is so true of her.
