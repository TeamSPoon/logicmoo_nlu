Hey what do you think of Adele's music?
I think she's got a lot of talent and although I don't want to really admit it I like her music.
Why wouldn't you want to admit you like her music?
Well he music in my opinion is for a certain group of listeners.
What do you mean?
Well a lot of her songs are all love songs based on having a borken heart.
Yeah, she sung from her own personal experiences.
Yeah, I just feel that  her songs are for hopeless romantics.
I guess you have a point with that to a degree but I think about it in a different way.
How do you see it?
Well I see it as a a person who sings about her own personal expeirence and people just happen to relate.
Yeah I can understand that and it makes sense.
All in all I think her powerful voice and personal experiences is how she gained her popularity.
Yeah, I'll admit thats how I happened along her music.
I was the exact same way. I'm pretty sure everyone I know got into her music the same way we did.
While I am a fan I still don't listen to her music as much as the average fan.
Why? Don't want to appear soft or something?
I wouldn't say that. I just think her songs bring down mood and make you dwell on the negative.
Now it makes snese why you don't want to admit you like her music.
Yeah, While its great music it's not something I'd want to hear often.
