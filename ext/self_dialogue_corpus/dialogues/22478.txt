I saw the movie Split recently.
That's cool. How was it?
It was crazy. I liked it.
That's the new m. Knight movie right?
Yes. It's really good.
Not all of his movies are though.
Some were bad but not enough this one.
Good. I hated The Happening.
This is way better. It's about split personality disorder.
Oh. How does it incorporate that?
The main character has it. He is nuts.
How do you mean?
He has twenty some personalities and a few are really bad.
It is scary? I'm scared easy.
A little. One of the personalities is a beast.
A beast?  What do you mean?
He turns into a monster at the end.
Oh wow! What happens?
It's a surprise ending.
Cool. Don't tell me.
