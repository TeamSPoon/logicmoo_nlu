Did you see the new Tom Hiddleston movie?
No, what is it?
It's called Kong: Skull Island.
Is it another King Kong movie?
Yeah it takes place on the island, instead of in New York.
Hmm that's interesting. What did you think?
I thought it was good! Even though it's starring Tom Hiddleston, I really liked John C. Reilly's character.
Who does he play?
He plays a pilot named Hank Marlow that was strapped on Skull Island in WWII.
Wow that sounds like a plot twist.
Yeah, the movie is secretly about his character.
That's really cool! How were the special effects?
They were great! Definitely first-rate.
Is it overly filled with CGI?
There's a lot of CGI, which can be disappointing to some people, but I did not mind it.
Yeah, I usually don't like a lot of CGI, so I would have to see.
I highly recommend it!
I might give it a try for something to do this weekend.
Let me know if you do!
I will.
