Have you seen the new Beauty and the Beast movie?
No I haven't but I really want to, have you seen it yet?
Yes I did.
It looks like it would be really good, was it?
I enjoyed it so much that I want to see it again.
Was it as good or better than the original?
I think they are both as good, this one is just different because its with real people.
It must have been magical seeing it come to life.
I was really surprised by how much I enjoyed it.
How was Emma Watson?
