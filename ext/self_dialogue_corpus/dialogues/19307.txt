Who do you think are rocks best guitarists?
Oh man there are so many good ones. But my personal best are Eric Clapton, Eddie Van Halen and Jimmy Page.
Those are great guys! There were some really good ones who are now gone.
Oh yeah! Stevie Ray Vaughn, B.B. King and Duane Allman were masters.
Do you know what the longest guitar solo on record is?
I'm not sure but the Freebird solo is pretty long.
The longest was one for 24 hours and 55 minutes. It was done by David DiDonato who set the record in 2012.
Man that is crazy! I bet his fingers were sore after that.
Sure thing! And just so you know, that Freebird solo is not really that long. It's just that the song itself is over 13 minutes long.
Well it's definitely one of the best songs ever recorded. It's a shame what happened to the band.
It's really sad. Their plane crashed on October 20, 1977 and they lost three band members.
Yes, Ronnie Van Zant was a true treasure and his loss in the music world is still felt.
Did you know Ronnie had 2 brothers named Donnie and Johnny?
Yes. Donnie was a member of .38 Special and Johnny currently sings with the new Lynyrd Skynyrd.
Have they put out any new albums lately?
The last album they made was Last of a Dyin' Breed. It was released on August 21, 2012.
Do they still tour?
Yes they are still touring and making beautiful music for us to hear. The latest tour end on December 12th in Brazil.
That's really cool that they have fans in Brazil.
Yeah they are famous worldwide.
