I love the movie Sucker Punch.
You're talking about the one with Emily Browning and Oscar Isaac, right?
Yep, that's the one.
I never got around to seeing it. What's so good about it?
First of all, the cinematography is amazing. Zack Snyder was the director.
He sounds familiar. Didn't he just direct Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice?
That's right. So many critics don't like his movies, but I think he puts so much work into making them look great.
Yeah, but good cinematography can only take you so far.
I see what you're saying, but in the case of Sucker Punch I thought everything about the movie was great.
I thought I heard somewhere the acting was subpar.
No way. Emily Browning, Abbie Cornish, Oscar Isaac, and Carla Gugino were amazing.
I do enjoy Oscar Isaac. He's in The Promise alongside Christian Bale.
Really? I haven't seen anything with Christian Bale in it for a long time.
He was in Out of the Furnace not too long ago.
Oh yeah. I wanted to see that one but never got around to it.
I thought it was really good, although I don't really enjoy Casey Affleck as an actor.
That's funny. I don't mind Casey, but I don't really care for his brother Ben.
Are you serious? I loved Ben Affleck in Good Will Hunting.
I only ever liked him in He's Just Not That Into You.
He was pretty lovable in that movie
