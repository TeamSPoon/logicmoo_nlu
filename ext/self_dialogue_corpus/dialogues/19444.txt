What's your favorite underground hip hop artist?
Without a doubt it is Earl Sweatshirt.
Wasn't he a part of the group Odd Future?
He sure was! But he has done a couple solo albums as well.
He was awesome. Him and Taco were my favorite members i the group.
Same here. I loved their flow, but I'm not as much of a fan when it comes to Tyler the Creator.
Me either. He's alright, but not as good as the other two.
What other underground artists do you like in the hip hop scene?
I used to be really into Brother Ali.
I've never heard of him. Is he any good?
Oh, he was awesome! His lyrics are always so important and focus on serious issues.
Has he released anything new lately that I could check out?
Not that I know of. I'm not even sure if he is still touring.
Do you have any other favorites?
I like Snow The Product and Honey Cocaine.
They're awesome and they both have made a huge impact on the female rap scene.
I totally agree. They both have a serious flow and always come out with awesome hits.
They sort of remind me of a cross between Remy Ma and Kreayshawn, but way better than both of them. Even combined.
I know just what you mean! I can't wait for Tyga and Honey to release a new mixtape.
Me too, I hope it is soon!
