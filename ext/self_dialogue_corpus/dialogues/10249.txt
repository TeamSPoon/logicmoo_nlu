Did you see Kong: Skull Island yet?
Yes I have.
What did you think of it?
I thought it was amazing actually, you?
Me too, I really liked how they incorporated the giant animals on the island, that was really cool.
I agree, watching Kong fight with giant monsters was my favorite part.
Do you think they will make a sequel?
I sure hope so, John Goodman and Samuel L Jackson did such a good job in that movie?
Didn't they both die in it though?
I think so.
