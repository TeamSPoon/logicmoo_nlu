I just rewatched the Chamber of Secrets, and I have some issues with it.
I bet I already know what they are, but shoot.
How in the world did no one know a CHAMBER was sitting inside the school the whole time?
Haha, let it out. It bothers me too.
Well, I guess they kind of knew, because it had been opened before. But then why didn't Dumbledore destroy it?
That bothers me so much. Let's just keep this really odd killing chamber in the school and hope for the best.
Exactly, with the top minds in the Magical kingdom thinking it's okay, I mean come on.
Yeah anyone could see that's a terrible idea.
And, who the heck would EVER hire Lockhart? That whole book/movie was just a set of contradictions.
Well no one wanted the job, so let me pick the absolute worst candidate in history, because why not? Haha
