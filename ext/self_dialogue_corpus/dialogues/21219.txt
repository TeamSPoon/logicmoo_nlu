What do you like about going to the movies? It seems too costly for me for what you get.
I actually agree. The last movie I saw in theaters was the second Chipmunks one.
Oh, so you don't go often.
No. I feel like it costs too much.
The snacks are expensive too.
I like to watch at home so I can spend my money on better snacks.
Pls it's not so much hassle to go to the bathroom or whatever.
Right. You have to try getting past all those lets.
You also get to avoid people's badly behaved kids if you watch at home.
Don't get me started about that. I'm not sure wht people don't make their kids sit down and behave.
Especially if they just spent all that money.
Right. It's insane.
I don't take my kids unless I feel like they can handle it.
Neither do I.
Have your been to the movies?
Only the oldest. She went with some friends.
Was she good?
I think so. They saw the Lego Movie.
I enjoyed that.
So did she.
