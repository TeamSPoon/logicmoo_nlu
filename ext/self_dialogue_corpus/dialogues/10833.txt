Which is your favorite Fast & Furious movie?
My favorite The Fate of the Furious
Is that the one where Charlize Theron was the villian Cipher?
Yes! She played that part perfectly.
I agree she did. It was horrible when she killed Elena.
I know! I am so glad Dom and the team were able to beat her.
Me too. Dom's son was so cute at the end.
He was adorable. I think it's so good Letty was accepting of his son.
She really supports him. She was the main one saying that he hadn't gone rouge.
Yeah she really loves him.
