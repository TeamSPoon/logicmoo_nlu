Did you ever see The Gorilla?
I'm not sure. How old is it?
It's a really old and black & white. I think from around 1940.
I'm not sure. I've seen a lot of gorilla movies.
The Ritz Brothers were in it.
I think I may have. Was Bela Lugosi in it?
Yes, Bela Lugosi and Patsy Kelly!
Yes, I remember! She was hysterical tying to get away from the gorilla!
Yes, almost falling over her own feet and screaming for help!
I like her. I've seen her in many things.
Yes, she's pretty legendary.
Did you ever see Roadshow?
No, but I saw her in a funny football movie.
Are you thinking of Pigskin Parade?
I think so. Was it where she and her husband find this big dumb guy who can throw really good?
Yes, that's the one! It was really funny.
I've watched it a few times over the years.
The Tin Man from the Wizard of Oz was in it too!
The actor?
Yes, Jack Haley!
