I need a good family movie for movie night
I just watched Petes dragon, have you seen it?
No I havent, I watched it as a kid, the old one
The graphics are amazing and its really well done
Is it sad in any way, my son is very sensetive
Well there are a couple parts, the dragon gets caught, and at one point they have to leave each other
I think I need something more light hearted
How about minions
Oh thats a great idea, I love them
The last movie was hilarious, the kids and I enjoyed it
I think thats a winner , thank you
no problem, what was the last movie you saw
we watched finding nemo last week
I love that one, Dory is fun
Have you seen the Dory movie yet?
I did, it was great
Ellen plays Dory so well
I agree, she is naturaly goofy
Yes, and Dory is loved by the kids
she sure is
