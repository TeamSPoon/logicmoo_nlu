What kind of music do you think will be the next big thing?
What do you mean, Pop music is already huge?
Well we had indie bands come in by the hundreds about 5 years ago.
Oh Ok, I think it'll stay with pop
Yeah that seems to be the burgeoning genre
Though hip hop is sort of breaking through
I think rap artists try too hard to become singers
That was just Kanye West
Even the new Kendrick Lamar has some singing on it
He is a diverse artist though.
I agree with that but it could probably be dropped.
What about supergroups?
I dont think you see that often anymore. Guys stick with their bands.
Probably because of record contracts.
Yeah I know a band called United Nations.
Are they grindcore?
Yes but theyre comprised of a bunch of artists.
So how do they get around it.
They tour with their entire bodies covered.
Seems bizarre
