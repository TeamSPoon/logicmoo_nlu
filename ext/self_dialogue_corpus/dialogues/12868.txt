So, who's your favorite female character in Star Wars?
There aren't that many options, Leia or Amadala.
So who's your favorite?
Has anyone ever said Amadala?
Not yet.
Leia is my favorite female character.
Why?
Because my only other choice is Amydala and she sucked.
What did she do that was so horrible?
She married Darth Vader!
