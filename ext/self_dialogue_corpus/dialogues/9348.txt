Yes, isn't that weird. He's from Long Beach.
Well, I didn't realize he got his start in KMD, I thought he was just some underground dude who came from nowhere.
Nah, he definitely came from KMD. Do you have a favorite MF Doom, DOOM, Viktor Vaughn, et cetera, project?

my favorite is Madvillain which is a collaboration by Madlib and MF Doom.
