I fell asleep on Get Out last night. How did it end?
The guy survived and got away.
How did he do that?
His friend that worked with the TSA checked up on him?
Oh. Did the lady hypnotize him?
Yep. She did.
It was with that cup of tea wasn't it?
Yeah. The way she stirred it.
I figured that.
I remember when I first saw it. It made me uncomfortable, panicky, and I actually make you laughed a lot.
Yeah it is a phenomenal thriller that kept me on edge with its strange mysteries, disturbing truths, and some brilliantly crafted clues to not only the end.
But you just couldn't stay awake while you were watching it?
Get Out wasn't boring. I fell asleep because we just rotated on my job.
Oh yeah. I forgot you'r back on nights again.
I think it is an excellent movie! The story line is unique and really refreshing.
Get Out is a strange and unnerving thriller that is combination of a racial & horror fueled film.
Get Out is easily one of the best original movies in a long time.
I agree and  the script is so smartly and cleverly written with its racial commentary.
This movie kinda made me fear the sound of a spoon hitting the side of a tea cup.
Somebody doesn't want to get hypnotized?
