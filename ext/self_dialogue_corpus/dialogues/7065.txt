Did you know they are making Toy Story 4?
What did not know that!
Yes, and Don Rickles who played Mr. Potato Head just died.
Oh no. That is sad. What will they do?
Luckily all the voice work was already completed.
That is good but still sad that he died.
Yes. I wonder what the story line will be though?
I do too. Maybe it will focus on the toys in their new home.
It would be really sad if they show the girl that Andy gave the toys to grow up and not want to play with them also.
Don't be silly. They wouldn't do that.
