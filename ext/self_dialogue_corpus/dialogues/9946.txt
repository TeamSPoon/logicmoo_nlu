Is there a rapper that everyone likes that you just don't get.
Yup, his name is Jermaine Cole. J. Cole.
You don't like J. Cole? Really?
Nope, I think it's a shame he gets lumped in with Kendrick and some of the other current greats. I think he's making okay music that people think is "deep."
That's harsh! Have you listened to J. Cole's 2014 Forest Hills Drive?
Yup, I like a handful of songs, like G.O.M.D., but I'd be fine if I never heard him again. What rapper do you think is overhyped?
I don't really get Future.
I understand that. He's vulgar and his music is very unique sounding.
Yeah, his style just doesn't do it for me. All of his songs sound kind of similar to me, but people love him.
Yes, fans, critics and rappers themselves love Future.
