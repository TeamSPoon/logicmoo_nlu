Do you like to listen to alternative music?
Sometimes.
You should definitely listen to Asteroids Galaxy Tour.
Oh really?
Yeah the song Golden Age is absolutely fantastic!
Oh I think I heard that before on a commercial.
Yeah that is how most people have heard that song.
I do like the song by them called Around the Bend.
That is also cool for a song. It is very mellow.
They have a very groovy sound to them I think.
That is for sure.
What else do you listen to?
I like listening to Cage the Elephant.
What song?
Ain't No Rest for the Wicked.
That is a catchy song.
It was the first song I heard by them.
Interesting.
Well it was great chatting with you!
I agree!
