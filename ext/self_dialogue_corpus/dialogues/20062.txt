Have you heard about the new Aliens movie?
I did, but I haven't seen the trailer yet. Have you?
I did. It looks pretty good. The special effects are amazing.
I bet they are. I hope the new movie isn't all special effects.
Me too. The old ones used models, but they did a great job with it.
I agree. I think the story is far more important than most people believe.
Ridley Scott is involved with this movie as well.
Is he, or is it just his production company.
Actually, I don't know.
Hopefully he has some input.
I imagine he would, because he was so central to the other movies.
Yeah, I can't see how he stays uninvolved.
At least the new cast looks good.
Really, who's in it?
Danny McBride for one.
I don't remember there being any comedic relief in the first movies.
There was some, but not much.
I guess you're right.
In any case, I'll likely see it when it comes out.
Let me know. I'd like to go as well.
