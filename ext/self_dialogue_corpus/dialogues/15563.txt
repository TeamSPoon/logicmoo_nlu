Did you see that Radiohead re-released OK Computer with a bunch of new tracks?
No I didn't! When did this happen?
Just this week.
Oh wow, what is the album called?
It's called "OK Computer - OK not OK".
Kind of a crazy name huh?
Yeah, but I think the point is that the second half are B-sides and stuff that was previously unreleased.
Oh I get it. I guess that makes sense.
I thought you were a big fan of theirs, am I wrong?
No I like them a lot. But the last few albums they put out were not quite my taste.
Yeah I get that. Their music has become a lot more experimental in recent years.
Exactly! But their older stuff, now that I really loved!
Well you should check this out then! The old tracks are remasted and the new tracks are mostly b-sides from back when they originally made OK Computer.
I could really get into that. OK Computer might be the best album they ever made!
For sure! You'll love the first of the new songs, it's called "I Promise".
OK, I'm going to check this out today. Where did you get the album?
I stream it through my Google Play Music account.
Awesome, I have an account too. Was it easy to find?
Yeah, it is right there in the new releases section.
Sweet! Thanks for telling me about it!
