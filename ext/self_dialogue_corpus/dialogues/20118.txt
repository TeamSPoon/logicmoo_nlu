I like foreign movies.
I don't like to read subtitles.
I keep subtitles on whenever I can, even for movies in English.
That would drive me crazy!
Sometimes I have trouble he aring the dialogue in English movies.
Why do you like foreign movies?
I am finding the quality much better, and always improving,
How so?
Well, the stories are less formulaic, and underscore social issues Americans normally wouldn't be aware of.
But they must be lower budget than American movies.
Surprisingly not. There are excellent special effects and great music in movies even from developing countries.
What countries?
Well, Thailand for one. The quality of production is excellent and the writing and acting is superb.
I wouldn't have expected that.
South Korea is also producing good films.
I suppose they are about martial arts, mostly.
No, actually. The are some, but many more are moving dramas that are also quite educational about the kinds of lives people live in other countries.
That sound boring.
Not at all. In fact, some are very gripping tear-jerkers, often about generational differences as times rapidly change as countries develop.
Maybe I'll check some out sometime, but I really hate reading subtitles.
