What did you think about the movie, 'Moana?'
It was a really cool movie, and quite possibly the best one of the past few years.
Better than 'Frozen?'
Yes, for sure.  The characters and music of 'Moana' were superior to that of 'Frozen.'
What about 'Let it Go?'
'Let it Go' was catchy, but it was almost like the chorus was written, then the rest of the song was an after thought.
Which song from 'Moana' did you like the best?
'How Far I'll Go' was so good.  It also had a beginning, middle, and end to it.
I like that song too.  Who wrote it again?
The talented, Lin-Manuel Miranda!
