Halloween is still one of favorite thriller movies.
That was just downright scary.
It scared me.
Jamie Lee Curtis was fantastic in it.
She was great.
Just to hear the name Michael Myers gives me chills.
John Carpenter did a great job directing.
Yes he did.
That was made in 1978.
Didn't realize how long ago it was.
