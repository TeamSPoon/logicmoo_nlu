Hey man, what's good?
This music.
What you listening to?
I'm bumping some jams from off the Juice Soundtrack.
Awe man, Juice was that thing. What song you playing?
Right now, Aaron Hall Don't Be Afraid.
Lord had mercy. That was summer of 1991. We tore things up back then.
Oooh wee baby, no need to be afraid...
You know how many honeys used to started shaking that booty when that thing dropped? Aaron Hall was that dude.
Yeah, until R Kelly came and took his spot.
Bump and Grind? Chicks were losing their mind behind R i tell you.
I used to like Al B Sure myself.
Yeah but Al just had that first album and then it was a rap.
Night and Day is still a classic though.
You ain't never lie. That whole side one used to get it done.
Al B sound a little like Teddy Riley.
What?
On that Guy song You Can Call Me Crazy, Teddy sound just like Al B.
You never know. They might have pulled a Milli Vanilli.
Wow. I haven't heard that name in like twenty years.
