Do you like The Beatles?
Yes, who doesn't like them?
Who is your favorite Beatle?
I will have to say Paul McCartney, how about you?
I like John Lennon.  How about Yoko Ono, his wife, what do you think about her?
They fit together.  It worked for them.
Yeah I guess. What was your favorite Beatle song?
Let it Be, how about yours?
Elanor Rigby, but I also like Yellow Submarine.
Yes there are so many good ones.
