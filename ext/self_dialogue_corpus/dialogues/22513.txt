Are you a fan of the movies from the eighties?
Yes, they made a lot of great movies back then.
Have you seen any with who they call the Rat Pack?
Oh yes, Breakfast Club, Sixteen Candles and a bunch more.
Which is your favorite?
I think Breakfast club.
Me too. All so different and all the same too.
Yea it was a great idea for a movie .
Yea and the actors they had play the characters just fit the parts.
Yea, we had the jock, the prep, the geek , the emo girl and the bad boy.
Yea, they fit together well.
They are still all around today acting.
I wonder how old they were when they made that movie.
Don't know, but they made so many in the eighties, they must have been all very young.
Sixteen candles was a great one too.
Yes, it was I like the foreign exchange student. He was funny.
Yes, he had great lines.
Wonder where he is now.
They should make a movie with all the same actors, like some type of reunion.
Yes, The Breakfast Club all dressed Pretty in Pink and Blew out Sixteen Candles together. Sounds good huh?
