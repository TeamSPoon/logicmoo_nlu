Have you seen any decnet movies lately?
In all honest I really am not too amped for the majority of movies.
Why not?
Personally they are either dry reboots, standard chick flicks, and duds.
What's the last movie you've seen?
John Wick 2 was the last movies that I saw. I was very excited to see it.
Actually now that I think about it, that film was the only movie as of late that has delivered on the entertainment scale.
I agree. People are hyping up Wonder Woman but part of me thinks it will be ruined like Ghost Busters was.
Ghost Busters? How was that ruined?
You didn't see the remake? It was a gender bend of the original film.
That doesn't sound too bad, what exactly ruined it for you?
Well the fact that the film made it seem like the original never happened and they every guy in the film was portrayed as a bumbling idiot.
Come on every guy?
Yes every single one. Even stand ins.
Yikes, that does sound a bit bad, but I don't think Wonder Woman will be anything like that.
I have my doubts, I don't think it will be as bad as Ghost Busters but I can already imagine there will be some kind of shot at men in the film.
I'm sure there will be one or two but I can over look it as long as the film is good.
I'm going to wait till it hits amazon or something.
Why that long?
It just seems like most movies now a days are being rushed to digital media.
