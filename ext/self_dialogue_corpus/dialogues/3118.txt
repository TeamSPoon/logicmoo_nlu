I can't  wait for the NFL season to start
Me too, I'm going to some preseason games
Really? The rams, right?
No, I'm flying back home to catch a ravens game
Man I love the ravens
Me too, ever since they won the superbowl
Yes, 2000. Nobody thought they would, right?
I was barely paying attention to that game.
But it was prettty cool. I don't even mind the bandwagoners
Yeah, the team was young then
It's so fun to go to the game, isn't it? I love games.
Bundling up in the winter, getting a cold brewski
Wearing my favorite jersey,
I bleed purple!!
I know, me too.
I hope the rookies from the draft are good.
Me too. I want another championship
I think this is the year, I'll be there, my work got some box seats so we can catch a few games this season
No way, where are the seats?
The 50 yard line. Isn't that awesome ? I love football.
