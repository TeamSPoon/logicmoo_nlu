Which decade of music had the best rock?
I would say the 1990s.
Why do you like the 1990s?  I think the classic rock of the 1970s is king.
Who is your favorite band from the 1970s?
I think the Rolling Stones is my favorite.  Songs like "Paint It Black" and "Sympathy for the Devil" made me a fan.
As silly as it sounds, I would put a band like Soundgarden's work up against the Rolling Stones.
That is blasphemy.
Hear me out.  Chris Cornell had a much better voice than Mick Jagger.
He did, but what about the rest of the Sound Garden compared to The Rolling Stones?
Well, listen to a song like "Burden In My Hand" and you will see Soundgarden's members were talented in all different areas.
