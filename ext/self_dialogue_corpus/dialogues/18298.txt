What is your favorite artist?
I really enjoy Taylor Swift's music.
Oh, she's pretty good but I liked her country music better?
Really? 1989 is such a great album.
Her album Red, is a hundred times better.
But that album isn't complete country, there is some pop feel.
Yes, but that was before her whole big transformation.
Yeah you're right.
What's your favorite song off 1989?
I really enjoy Style and Welcome to New York. What are yours?
I like Blank Space and Out of the Woods.
Have you seen the music video for Blank Space?
It is amazing! I was in suspense the whole time!
Right?! What a genius video.
I can't wait till she releases new music.
I know! It's been years since 1989.
I hope she goes back to her country roots.
I strongly doubt it, 1989 got her a grammy.
I know, she is amazing.
Let's keep hoping for music soon.
