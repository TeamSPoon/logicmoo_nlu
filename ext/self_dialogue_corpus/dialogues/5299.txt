I saw an older Disney movie the other day that I hadn't seen in a long time.
What movie was that?
It was Oliver and Company. I forgot how good that movie was.
I remember watching that when I was kid.
It was a classic when we were younger.
I liked that Billy Joel did some music for it and Bette Midler too.
Did you know Joey Lawrence did Oliver's voice?
Really? I didn't know that. He was really young then.
Yeah. Hard to believe that movie came out so long ago.
I wonder if they will ever do a sequel to that one.
