Do you like new country music?
Do you mean the stuff that sounds like hip hop?
Yes.
I do like it.
I like it as well, it is too bad people bash it frequently.
It is too bad.

Florida Georgia Line.
Yes, they are great.
People make fun of them but I like their sound.
I like their sound as well, they are upbeat and fun to listen to.
I agree.
What is your favorite song?
Cruise.
That is my favorite as well.
Have you ever heard the remake.

Yup that is the one.
Yes.  I like that version.
It is a neat mix of sounds between the rapper and country group.
