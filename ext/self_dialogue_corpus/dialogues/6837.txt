Hey, what's your favorite newer Disney movie?
Well, I really liked the new Jungle.
Oh you are right, it was really good.
Yeah, I thought the special effects were really good looking.
They were good! And the acting was good too.
Yeah, the boy that starred in it did really well.
Yeah, I think he might of been better than the older jungle book movies.
True. I really liked Idris too.
Yeah, his voice was really perfect for that part.
I even jumped a couple times from his loud booming voice.
