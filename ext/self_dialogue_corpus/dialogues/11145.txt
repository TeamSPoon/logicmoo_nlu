Hi!  What are you doing today?
I'm not sure.  I have a bit of free time today.
Do you want to go shopping?
Sure.  Where do you want to meet up?
Let's meet at the mall.  I need a new dress.
Ok.  I'll see you there in about 20 minutes.
I'm glad you were able to meet me.
No problem.  I have nothing else to do.
Good, you can help me pick out a dress to wear to my cousin's wedding.
Oh, I love weddings.
Me too! This wedding should be much fun, but I feel I need a new fashionable dress to wear to the event.
I totally understand.
Let's go into this store.  I see some cute dresses.
How about this dress.  I like the soft material and it's strapless.  It will be perfect for the wedding.
I like the color and style, but I'm not fond of strapless dresses. Do you see anything that is cute, sleeveless, but not strapless.
Oh, this one is totally cute.  Do you like the stripes?
I love the stripes!  This is it and they have my size.
Try it on!
Too cute.  I'm getting this one, what do you think?
I love it.  You'll be the best dressed at the wedding-besides the bride of course!
