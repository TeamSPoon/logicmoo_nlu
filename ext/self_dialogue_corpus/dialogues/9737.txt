So who has had the best album of 2017 so far?
That's tough. It's got to be Drake or Kendrick Lamar.
I forgot that Drake dropped "More Life" this year. I was gonna say Kendrick, hands down.
Yeah Big Sean put out "I Decided" too.
Every song I have heard off of that is really good, too.
It's been a good year for rap albums.
So which do you think was best? I'm still going with Kendrick.
I'm actually going to stick with Drake. Although, "Humble" is a crazy track.
Definitely my favorite on the CD.
"DNA" is good too. Still, Drake is the king of hip hop right now.
