Have you ever read Caitlan Moran's How to Be a woman?
I have yes, why?
She has a whole chapter on Lady Gaga in it
Really? What does she say?
She mostly just gushes but she gets to have drinks with Gaga
How is Gaga?
Flamboyant but also aware she's putting on a show
Does Moran love her
Yes, she loves her and her music so much
I'll have to read it.
