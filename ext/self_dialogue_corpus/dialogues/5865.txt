I think Snow White is one of the best Disney movies.
Why is that?
Well, it was one of the first ones. So it kind of started something larger.
I guess that's true. Is the movie itself that great though?
I liked it! The dwarves were funny and the witch was really creepy.
Yeah, I remember I used to have nightmares about her trying to offer me an apple as a kid.
I also just loved the animation style back then. It was hand-drawn!
It is kind of neat that they used to do that.
I wish they still made hand-drawn movies.
Maybe Disney will eventually go back to that!
