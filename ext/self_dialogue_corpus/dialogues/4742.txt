Do you think the Pirates have a chance at getting to the World Series this year?
I'm not sure, I haven't really been following their lineup.  I'm rooting for the Yankees!
How can you like the Yankees?  They are only good because they have so much money, they can buy a championship.
The Yankees are a historic institution.  They don't do anything that every other team would do if they had the money.
I agree that they have a very rich history, but they seem so snobby.  Like they feel they have earned the right to win, like it is expected.
Say what you will but have you ever been to Yankee Stadium?  It's like magic.
I've been a couple of times. Nothing like seeing the Yankees play the Red Sox!
The best games I've ever seen have been the Yankees versus the Sox.  The crowd is just electric!
Completely agreed.  That's when you can see the true spirit of the MLB, you can just feel the energy and passion.
I can't wait to bring my kids one day to see one of those games.  It's like a family tradition.
I love the traditionalism of Yankee Stadium.  It isn't one of the fancy stadiums catering to the wealthy.
Remember when the Arizona Diamondbacks stadium was opened?  They had a swimming pool!
I know, it was ridiculous!  We're here to watch baseball, not have a college party!
I do admit though that the Yankees have their faults though.  They have premium seating that is beyond expensive.
Is the premium seating just at a better section of the ballpark?  Or are there rules?
I believe it is the first four or five rows behind the Yankees dugout.
I can't even imagine being that close.  I always end up higher up, more often then not in the nosebleed.
It isn't a huge deal though.  Half of the fun is the spirit and the energy of the ballpark, not the seats.
I agree with you somewhat, but it would be exhilarating to sit that close, be able to hear conversations in the dugout.
One day maybe you'll sit there!  I bet the Yankees have contests for tickets, we should look that up!
