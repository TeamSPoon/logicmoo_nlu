Did you get to see the Zookeepers Wife?
No, I have not. What was it like?
It is about the Warsaw Zoo, and how the caretaker's try to save lives from Warsaw Ghetto, by using the zoo secretly.
So what year does it take place in?
The time is 1939 and the place is Poland, homeland of Antonina Zabinski and her husband, Dr. Jan Zabinski.
That sounds fantastic, a piece of history.
It was released March 31, 2017.
Who stars in it?
Jessica Chastain stars in this one along with Daniel Bruel.
Have the critics been kind to it?
Well, it got 7 out of 10 stars, but it has not made that much money.

Yes, this is no exception.  It made $21 million in the box office.
Who is the director of the movie?
Niki Caro directed this movie.
Who wrote the screenplay?
Angela Workman created the screenplay.
I would like to go see it some time this week.
