Did you see there is a new Thor movie coming out.
Yeah, I saw a poster at the theatre. It doesn't look like Chris Hemsworth.
Thats what I thought too, but it is.
Why did they cut his hair?
I have no idea, but that's what it looks like.
Bummer. Doesn't seem right.
I know! Not classic Thor.
Looks like the Hulk will be in it though.
Yeah, that's a great pairing.
I agree.
When does it hit theatres.
Novevember 3rd.
Thats a while.
Yeah, just it time for Thanksgiving.
Well, I'll be thankful if it's any good!
Ha! We should go check it out.
Yeah, I'll pencil you in.
It's a date!
My wife won't like that very much!
What she doesn't know...
