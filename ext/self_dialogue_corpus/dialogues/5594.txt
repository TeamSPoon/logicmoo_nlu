Have you seen what new Disney movies are coming out this week?
No, have you?
Yeah, they have Cars 3.
That should be awesome!
Yeah, my kids are thrilled.
I think I am thrilled hearing that.
My kids have been asking me to go to the movies, and this Disney one is a hit.
I know, Disney never fails to amaze me.
They are so creative at Disney.
Only the best artists are working on their movies.  The songs are incredible too in the movies.
