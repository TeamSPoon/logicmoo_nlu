What brad pitt movie is your favorite?
Hands down Seven.
I enjoyed the premise but thought he has been stronger in other roles.
Like what?
Fight club , he owned that movie.
I think you have to give it to both edward and brad in fight club.
But Tyler Durden is fight club. that character is amazing and so pivotol.
I think we will have to agree to disagree. I also think helena boham carter is amazing in this film.
She is and so is edward just saying I find brad standing out the most here.
Well I argue for his seven performance. that ending scene when he is with kevin spacey is remarkable,
It's good but fight club still knocks that one out for me.
Fair enough. what about Edward norton? Favorite role of his?
Well I love Moonrise Kingdom . I thought he was great as Scout Master Ward.
It was cute but was it his best performance?
No, not truly. Performance I would say American History X.
He was so hardcore in that role.
Ya, very dedicated. Even did some editing on that film.
Multi talented guy.
I think most actors are multi talented. In general creative people.
Ya there a lot of actor /director or actor/writers.
