Have you heard Kendrick Lamar's new album??
Yes!! It is so good, probably my favorite rap album in several years.
I definitely agree with you, did you know he's touring as well?
I saw that he was coming here, but I bet tickets are crazy expensive.
It probably is, Kendrick Lamar is huge right now.
You know who else I've been loving?? Childish Gambino
Right?! He is crazy talent. Definitely one of the best triple threats of 2017.
I would love to see him live, I bet that'd be an amazing concert.
I hear that he's going to stop making music after this album.
That's a huge bummer, I hope he changes his mind.
