Yeah they are pretty good. They aged well.
It's been awhile since I've seen any of them
Same here. I should go check them out again.
I think I'll go look them up on Netflix.
I think the first Alien movie is my favorite.
I liked Aliens the best.

I agree. I loved the action scenes in that one the most.
My favorite part is when the alien queen died at the end.
That was the best part!
