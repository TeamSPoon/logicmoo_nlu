What's your favorite Christmas movie?
That's tough but I have to go with Mulpets Christmas Carol.
Oh good choice. Why?
We watch it every year on Christmas Eve. It's amazing anyway but that's why it's my favorite.
Michael Caine is in that right?
That's right. He plays Scrooge and he's the best Scrooge of all time.
Who do they get to play Marley and Marley.
Waldorf and Statler.
That's perfect!
Yea their song is great! I love those two grumpy guys.
