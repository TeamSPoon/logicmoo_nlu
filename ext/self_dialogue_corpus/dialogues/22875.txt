You know what was a really good movie?
No, what's that?
That movie that starred Brandy and Whitney Houston.
That was a made-for-tv movie wasn't it?
Yeah it was.
What was the name of it?
Cinderella.
Cinderella?
Yeah.
How was that Cinderella and they were playing all of Brandy's music in there?
I don't know but it was a good movie.
Naw dog.
What you mean?
It wasn't a good movie. You just liked it because of the music.
Dude, the movie was a musical.
The story of Cinderella wasn't no music involved.
Whatever man. I still think it was a good movie.
Oh so I guess you like The Billionaire Boys Club as well?
Man what are you talking about?
Exactly. Two corny movies my dude.
