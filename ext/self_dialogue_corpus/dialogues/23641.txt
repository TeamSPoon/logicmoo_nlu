Have you seen the latest Leonardo DiCaprio movie?
No, which one was it? I lost track.
It was the Revenant.
Oh is that the one, where he lost the Oscar?
No, actually is the one where he won it. He lost many other times.
Seriously, what is it about?
It´s based on an historical figure describing frontiersman Hugh Glass´s experiences in 1823.But the movie is so good! Definitely Leo´s best acting.
What else happens in the movie?
The main character has a son, who is killed and the plot develops from here, plus there is a scene with a bear and another with a horse that is a must see.
All this sounds very  interesting, do you know who directed it?
Yes, the director´s name is Alejandro G. Inarritu
What other movies famous has he directed?
He directed Birdman and Babel.
Oh no wonder, he did a great job!.
Anyways, I think other movies of Leo´s where Oscar deserving.
Like, which ones?
The Wolf of Wall Street, The Great Gatsby, Inception, The Departed, The Aviator, he did great performances on all those movies.
I haven't´s seen Inception, what is it about?
It´s really cool!. This team manages to go into your dreams and manipulate information, but it´s all very real. You have to see it to understand me.
Okay, I will definitely see it and also I will see The Aviator because I don´t remember it very much.
