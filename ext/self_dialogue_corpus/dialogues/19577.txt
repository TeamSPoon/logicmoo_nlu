What's that you are listening to?
A track off of Massive Attack - Paradise Circus [Electronica] 2010 album.
It sounds different.
ILove this track. I was so glad when it was used as the theme for Luther.
It was in Luther. That's how you found out about it, huh?
Yes.
Is that when it was first introduced?
No. It was first was first introduced to the song via this remix by Zeds Dead in some artsy porn compilation.
Porn?
Don't worry, I don't watch the stuff.
Then how did you know that it was in a porn compilation?
Google. When I first heard the song, I looked it up to see what band did it.
Oh, okay.
It's  an amazing song. Reminds me some of the most beautiful and most depressing nights of my life.
It doesn't sound too bad.
It is like this kind of dark chill music. If you know what I mean.
The more I hear it, the more I don't like it.
Why not?
The singer's voice does nothing for me.
Well, I like it. It is just an amazing song.
