Have you seen the new Mummy movie?
The one with Tom Cruise?
Yes.
I have.  I saw it last week.
What did you think?
I didn't like it.
Me neither.  I thought it started out pretty good.
Me too.  Where did it go downhill for you?
Once they brought in Russell Crowe, I felt like it became too cheesy.
Yeah.  I didn't like the Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde bit.
I did like the story of the original Mummy and how it was a woman.
It was interesting, but I prefer the Brendan Fraser movies.
Me too.  There was so much comedy in those.
I like to watch those around Halloween.
They are perfect for my kids.
I agree, they have the perfect amount of scary.
I took my husband to see the new one, and he fell asleep.
Lol.
I promised him no more Tom Cruise movies.
I understand.  It's been a while since he made a good movie.
