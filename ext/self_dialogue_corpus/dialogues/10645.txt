So does  the new movie  hold up  in the  fast  and  furious  series ?
It is ok  but  I  think  its  off  character  for  some  of  the  guys.
And when is  the  kids  from  tokyo   drift  supposed to  show  up?
I  thought  after  Brian  and Han  left .
And  now most of the bad  guys are  good  guys?
I found parts of  stathams role  to  be funny  though .
I  did like when he  saved the baby.
I   think  he is  the   new  star  of the  franchise  soon  to  replace   vin disel .
And what do you think of vin disel  having to  go  against his  own  team ?
I thought  they made him  look  way too  strong  .
