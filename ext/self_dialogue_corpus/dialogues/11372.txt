Who did The Beatles see as their contemporaries that they were competing with?
I know that they for sure saw The Beach Boys as contemporaries.
Yeah, I've heard Pet Sounds was influenced by The Beatles.
Yup! And Pet Sounds in turn influenced The Beatles.
What a neat little feedback loop.
Yeah, it's really cool to see how different bands interact with and influence each other. No band is self-contained.
Anyone else that you know of that influenced, competed with The Beatles who were contemporaries?
Bob Dylan, for sure. I know that his lyrics had a big impact on The Beatles.
Yeah, he pretty much influenced everyone. Not surprising as The Beatles have great taste and Dylan is a legend.
Yeah, also bands like The Who, The Byrds, and of course musicians from India like Ravi Shankar.
