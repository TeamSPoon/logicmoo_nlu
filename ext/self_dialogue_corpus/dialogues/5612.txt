Do you like old or new Disney movies better?
I would have to say old, because I grew up on them.
Me too, and I haven't seen many of the new ones.
I really liked 'The Emperor's New Clothes' - that was my favorite of the newer Disney movies.
Incredible to think 'The Lion King' is almost 25 years old, and that's not one of the oldest.
Right - there's some from the 1940s that I still play for my kids.
That's the definition of timeless, really.
Even the humor stands the test of time. My kids love old Disney just as much as new Disney.
And the animation has improved but kept the same style, which I just love.
Exactly - there's a typical, iconic 'Disney style'.
