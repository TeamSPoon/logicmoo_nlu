Do you still listen to the Backstreet Boys?
I have not in 10 years.
What happened to them
They burst with the boy band bubble.
That was a great era in music
Yeah for girls who like pop music.
I think guys liked their songs
Theres no way that can be true
If they toured I bet guys would go
No way that music was for women only
