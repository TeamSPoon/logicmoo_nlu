Who is your favorite rock singer of all time?
If I had to choose just one, I'd say Eddie Vedder.
I love Pearl Jam, which album do you like best?
Ten was definitely their best album.
I agree. Vs. and Vitalogy were great too, but Ten was like nothing I'd ever heard before.
Yes, and their music videos were amazing - especially for the song Jeremy!
Jeremy's video still gives me goosebumps when I watch it.
Me too! When the boy is running in the woods you can really feel his rage.
And it was chilling how easy it was to relate to the angry kid!
Exactly! Because most everyone knew a kid like that in grade school and had no idea what they were dealing with at home.
