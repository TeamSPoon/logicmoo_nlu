I see To Kill a Mockingbird is in your Netflix queue.
So it is! I've already watched it but I might watch it again.
What did you think?
I thought it was great. Have you read the book?
I have not. I'm guessing the book was better.
Overall yeah. The things I like about the movie though don't really apply to the book.
What things?
Well the things I appreciated about the movie were the music, photography and acting.
Ah, yeah you don't get that in the book.
The book I thought was hilarious but the movie was so serious.
Really?
Yeah, everything I'd heard about it sounded so depressing, but the book was funny in a very natural way.
I never would have guessed.
Yeah, I don't like books where you can tell the author tried to sneak in jokes even if it doesn't make sense in context. The humor in the book was right in line with how the characters were and it was just humourous in how they were, not in what they said, telling jokes and such.
That's cool. No humour in the movie though?
No, it got really disappointing about half way through and then after that I just didn't know what the point was.
But you're always complaining about how movies turn out unrealistically happy.
Yeah, and this movie probably is more realistic than most, but it was still surprising and sad when Tom died.
You can't always have everything you want.
I've accepted it now and take the movie as it is.
