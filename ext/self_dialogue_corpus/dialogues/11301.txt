The Beatles used to be my favorite group.
How old are you--I hardly know any of their songs, they're so long ago.
Yeh, probably the greatest group of all time and you don't even know them.  Can you name them?
Actually I can--John Lennon,  Paul McCartney, George Harrison,  and Ringo Starr.
Very good, you don't know their songs, but you know their names--how come?
Read it it my high school history book.
Very funny young man--maybe you should listen to the Beatles once in awhile instead of that rap stuff.
Not too likely but what would you suggest.
Maybe something from their psychedelic period like Strawberry Fields or Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds.
Psychedelic?  Interesting, but I have to run.  Tell me about it some other day.
