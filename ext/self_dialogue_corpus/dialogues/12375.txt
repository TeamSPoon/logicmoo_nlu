What did you think of Rogue One?
I gotta say, I've only gotten partway through it.
Is it boring for you? There's so much going on!
But I'm not engaged. The girl is cute and spunky, of course, but this is not my Star Wars, I'm not emotionally involved.
Is there any character you like?
The little rolling robot cutie is the most engaging character to me. There, I said it, the robot is the best character.
That doesn't say much for anyone else.
Well, someone was smart enough to put Donnie Yen in the cast. He is absolutely amazing.
Yes, he was awesome in the Ip Man movies.
So I'll see the rest of the movie just to see him.
