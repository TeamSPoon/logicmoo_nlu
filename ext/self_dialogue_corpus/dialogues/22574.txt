Did you watch the original Resident Evil.
Yes actually recently.
What did you think?
I think they did an alright job though the effects are not great it turned out well.
Want to know a secret?
Sure.
They had an ultra small budget to work with on the first film.
That's not surprising yet impressive considering what they did.
What did you think of the story of the movie.
I loved it and it felt just like resident evil to me.
Same here I thought they did a good job putting it into a movie format.
Me too I was surprised how it felt just like the games.
The first one did feel exactly like the games slow paced exciting and fear inducing.
Felt like a mystery and then a fight for survival just like the games.
I can't agree more which were some of my favorite games growing up.
Did you like the ending.
I didn't quite like it but it was a nice way to set up for the next movie and the entire series of films.
I agree not the best ending but did what it was supposed to.
It felt a little anitclimactic.
In a way yes it did.
