What's your favorite Woody Allen film?
That's tough. I'd have to say there are at least three.
Annie Hall.
Pretty much automatic.
After that it gets harder.
One that doesn't often make the "Top 3" list is CRIMES AND MISDEMEANORS.
Agree. For me that was one of his best "serious" films.
Well, yes, it dealt with some pretty serious material, but in wasn't INTERIORS.
Right. Also, at that point, his audience was primed for serious output.
I remember how INTERIORS caught a lot of people off guard.
It definitely wasn't absurdist slapstick like TAKE THE MONEY AND RUN.
I heard  Paul Verhoeven and Joe Eszterhas wanted to use the name for SHOW GIRLS after less that enthusiastic previews.
Now THAT was a funny movie!
For all the wrong reasons.
Ruined Liz Berkeley's career.
Not her fault!
She was only following orders...
Off a cliff.
She coulda been somebody; she coulda been a contender.
I'd cast her in an ON THE WATERFRONT remake in Eva Marie Saint's role.
