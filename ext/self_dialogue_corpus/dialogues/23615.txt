I know you like Marvel movies, right?
Of course, as I am a rational sane person with a good opinion.
That was rude... but okay. What do you think is the LEAST successful character?
The guy who got killed in the opening of the Avengers who wasn't named.
Okay... the least successful superhero?
In terms of money made, or in the way they're perceived.
Perceived.
Easy: Thor.
Why do you think that?
Well, Thor isn't human. He's from another world.
So?
So, he grew up far away, it's hard to relate to him.
But he looks human.
Yeah, but he's a god and super old.
You don't think people like that?
No, I think they like people they can relate to.
So who is the most successful?
Iron Man, for sure.
Why?
He has no superpowers: he's just really smart.
