Do you listen to Modest Mouse?
I do. They're one of my favorite bands ever.
Did you know they just re-released The Lonesome Crowded West?
I did know that. I love that album!
Personally, I think it's one of the best rock albums of all time.
Me too! I can't stop listening to it!
I love how the imagery of the lyrics go hand in hand with the playing of the song.
Yes, it feels like you're right there with them as the events are unfolding.
The way Heart Cooks Brain keep repeating the lyrics over and over along with the riffs makes everything feel so bleak and desolate.
I felt the same way about Convenient Parking. It was haunting to me, but in a good way!
That's a good way to describe it. I don't really know any other music that makes me feel that way.
I really like the way Brock questions Christianity with such honesty.
That's another reason why I think this will always be one of my favorite albums of all time.
Exactly, this album completely represents the focused anger and confusion that lies inside people our age.
Well, the band members were in their early 20s when they wrote and recorded these songs.
My only criticism of this album is that Truckers atlas lasts five minutes too long for my liking.
Really? That's one of my favorite tracks for that exact reason.
I just feel as though it sucks a bit of the momentum out of the listening experience.
I think I read that they thought it's be cut post production, so they just kept playing.
Ah, well, that makes a lot of sense then.
