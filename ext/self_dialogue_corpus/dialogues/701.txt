I think the Steelers are headed nowhere fast
Why do you think that?
Big Ben is going to break down more and more
Yeah but they take the pressure off him with Leveon Bell
I dont think he is going to perform well
I think so, he just got paid
And thats why I think we see the end of his career come quicker than you think
No he has shown he has the skills needed to produce in this league
What happens though if he gets injured
All guys deal with that
Running backs normally dont see big paydays
Yeah but you gotta pay the ones who are workhorses
I think you let them go in free agency
Someone would give them a job
Maybe, but you dont committ to it.
So you think the Cowboys are going to let Elliot go?
No but they should
How can you say that he was a rookie of the year could have been an MVP
They got McFadden to 1000 yards the year before. Its all about the line.
I dont agree. You pay an elite back because there are not alot of them.
