I really like selena gomez as an actress
Me too.
Did you see the movie princess protection program?
The one with selena gomez and demi lovato?
Yes thats the one
That one was good, and it had a good ending
I like how they starting out disliking each other and ended uo being best friends
I liked that aspect too
Disney movies are so heartwarming
Thats why i love them
