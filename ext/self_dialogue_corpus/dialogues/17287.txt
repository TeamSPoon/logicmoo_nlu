Have you heard that the Gaslight Anthem went on hiatus?
I did, I hope that they make more music.
I do too, but I hope that it is more like their first album.
I agree, that one was probably their best work.
Did you see that Pearl Jam was inducted in the rock and roll hall of fame?
Yes, they deserve it, they have so many good albums.
Right? And they have been together for almost 30 years.
I know and the music that they are still putting out is still good.
Did you see that Gene Simmons is trying to trademark the devil horns sign?
I did not see that, but I am not surprised, Gene Simmons will try and make a dollar anyway he can.
Yea, he is a lunatic.
And kiss makes terrible music.
Yea, it is so generic and underwhelming.
And their fans are insane.
I hope that he loses his claim and it costs him a lot of money.
Me too, that would hurt him most, losing money.
I just wish Kiss would stop making music.
Me too, they have said that they were going to stop several times, I wish that they would.
Yeah, it is getting pretty sad at this point.
It has kind of always been sad.
