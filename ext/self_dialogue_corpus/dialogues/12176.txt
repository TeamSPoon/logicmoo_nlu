Do you like the new Star Wars movies
yes I do
I love the way they did the cameos of Leia, Han, and Luke
Yes I think that was a great way to honor them
Although I am not thrilled that the franchise was sold to Disney
Yes it does not really seem right to me
I hope that they will stay true to the stories
There are so many stories so there is plenty to choose from
So far they have all of the cheesyness of the originals
I agree, not in a bad way just a Star Wars way
