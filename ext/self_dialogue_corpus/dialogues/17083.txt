Was Soundgarden as influential as I am being told they were?
Yes I think they were very influential.
I only liked one song, Black Hole Sun.
They wrote so many good albums.
Can you even name one other song you liked?
Spoonman was very good.
OK I will give you that.
Plus they had side projects
Like what?
Audioslave for one.
OK that was one side project
But it had a huge impact on the rock genre.
I dont think it did and that would diminish Soundgarden's influence
Chris Cornell did a great job
Its a shame what happened to him
He went the route of all those 90s lead singers
Eddie Vedder is still alive!
True, but his lack of drug use has always been known.
Well Soundgarden was a big band no matter which way you spin it
I dont see them as favorably as you.
