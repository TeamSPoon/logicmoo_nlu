I bought tickets for Lollapalooza this summer, but now my boyfriend can't go. Do you want to go with me?
Did you buy a single day pass, or a four day pass?
It's a single day pass for Friday. The tickets were $120 each.
Okay, I can go. I can pay you for the ticket next payday.
That's fine. It should be a lot of fun, I love seeing all the different bands.
Me too. Who's playing Friday?
I specifically got Friday tickets because Blink 182 is playing that day.
I LOVE Blink 182. They have so many great sing along songs.
I hope they play All The Small Things.
I like Adam's Song, even though it's incredibly sad.
