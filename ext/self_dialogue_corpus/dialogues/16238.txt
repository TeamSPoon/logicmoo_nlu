Have you heard the new Lorde album?
No, is it good?
So good, as good as Royals
Really. I also want to check out the new MIA song
Is it on iTunes?
Yes, I just haven't downloaded it yet
The other one you should check out is Sia
I keep meaning to, I love that song Breathe Me
That's an old song it was in the Six Feet Under finale
Really? I didn't know it was so old
The newer stuff is really good.
I love the wigs she wears
Oh another one you should check out is Haim
Were they on Saturday Night Live
Yes, they sing the song The Line
Oh, I know that one!
Did you know they're sisters?
No way? I didn't know that!
Yes, I like them. I wonder if they're touring?
I should check!
