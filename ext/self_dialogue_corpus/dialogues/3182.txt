Who do you think is the best receiver in the NFL?
I think it is Julio Jones.
Does he play for Atlanta?
Yup, he is a Falcon.
That is what I thought.
He has great hand eye coordination.
He can really catch can't he.
He also is very graceful and has good balance.
I have heard some receivers take ballet lessons.
I have heard the same thing.
They almost need to for the jumping and landing they do.
I'm sure it helps.
Jones is great because he has Matt Ryan throwing to him also.
Yeah, Matt has turned into a decent quarterback.
They could be good this year.
I think they will be competitive.
I think they could win the whole thing.
Early in the year for a prediction like that.
I know, but I don't think it is too far fetched.
A lot can happen during a season, especially injuries.
