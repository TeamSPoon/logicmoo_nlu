The New Orleans Saints aren't a good team.
Do you think I'm a Saints fan?
No I was just wondering what your response would be to that.
I think they are a solid team.
Could you expand on your argument?
Drew Brees is all I need to say.
He is a pretty good Quarterback.
Did you say he is only pretty good?
Yeah do you have a problem with that?
Is almost 40 touchdowns and over 5,000 yards pretty good to you?
Well you conveniently left out that he had 15 interceptions this season.
That doesn't matter when you throw 40 touchdowns in a season.
That is a good point.
Think about it he almost threw three touchdowns a game!
Not bad at all to be honest.
Says the guy who said the Saints are a bad team.
I told you I was just curious about your reaction!
You aren't necessarily a Saints fan either.
That is true I'm more of a Tampa Bay guy.
Let's not get into that conversation.
