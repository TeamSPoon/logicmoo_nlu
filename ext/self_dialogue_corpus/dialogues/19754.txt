Do you like Katy perry?
Yes I like her music, do you?
Yes I love that alien song
That's one of my favorites.
I also like megan trainor
I love her
She songs are so fun
I feel the same way
I love dear future husband
I jam to that one all the time
It's a great song
I also like 3 am
It's not a happy message but she makes it sound so upbeat
Shes just fun
She is
I can't wait to see what she comes out with next
Me either
Shes a great entertainer
Nice talking to you
Thanks
