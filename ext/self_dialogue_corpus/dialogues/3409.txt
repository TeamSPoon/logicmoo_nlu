Where would you put The Conjuring on your list of best horror films of all time?
Nowhere near that list.
Oh geez why do you say that?
Because there was nothing scary about that movie.
I beg to differ and so do alot of movies.
OK well the list is subjective.
So what is on your list.
The top film of all time would be The Shining.
OK I guess I know where this is headed.
You can say that but many more people will say its number one than say The Conjuring is even good.
