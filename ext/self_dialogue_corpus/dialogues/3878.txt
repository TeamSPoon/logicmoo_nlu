Hey, have you seen the movie "Silence of the Lambs"?
No, I heard of it but never seen it.
Oh my, you have to see it with Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster.
What was it about?
Jodie Foster played an FBI agent looking into murders behind a serial killer and uses information obtained from interviewing a psychopathic psychiatrist to find the killer.
Oh right that's Hannibal the cannibal right?
Yes that is right Dr. Hannibal Lecter like to eat his patients.
Gross, is there any memorable lines from the movie?
"Hell Clarice." That is one of the more chilling lines the way he says hello to her before he even sees her because he can smell her.
I will have to see this now.
