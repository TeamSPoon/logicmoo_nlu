Do you know when Nine Inch Nails are going to release new music?
I don't know. It's suppose to be pretty soon.
Yeah, that's what their Facebook said a few months ago.
If I had to guess - maybe 2018?
Probably a smart guess.
Yeah I don't see them releasing anything within the next 5 months of this year.
Same. Especially since they're playing a few festivals the remainder of the year.
Yeah. Which is interesting actually with no new music.
Maybe they'll play a couple new tracks. Get the internet speculating a little.
Wouldn't be a terrible idea actually.
Yeah. Then release them officially early next year.
I like your thinking my friend.
Trent knows how to play the market. Plus you never know with NIN.
Yeah, remember The Slip? Came out of nowhere overnight!
Yeah, that shocked me.
I guess you never know these days.
The joys of uncertainty!
The good and the bad!
I guess life as well as music would be boring with stability.
In the long run it would be. I agree.
