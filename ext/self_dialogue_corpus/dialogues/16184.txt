This music sucks
What music
The one playing on the PA
Oh i am just ignoring that
Why does everywhere play this stuff
What stuff
Generic radio rock
Oh that
Yeah it blows chunks
Like i would understand if it was something good
but no it is crap
Yeah
Every venue does it too
I wish they would just play similar music as the bands playing
That would be so much better
Pretty much it would
I would not be annoyed if it was
Same man
Hope it is over soon
Same
