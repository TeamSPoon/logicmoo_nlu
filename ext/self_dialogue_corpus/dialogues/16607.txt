Do you listen to Taking Back Sunday?
They used to be my favorite band.
Tell All Your Friends was such a good album
I credit it with making me a fan of the scene.
It was definitely landmark when you think about it.
I can still remember listening to every track.
The lyrics they wrote were far better than anyone else.
Breaking up was the dumbest thing they ever did.
Yeah it really hampered the band
Though the follow up to that was not that bad.
Yeah I liked it.
And the one after that, Louder Now, was pretty good.
Then they started to tail off
At that point they started going through band members.
Whatever happened to them.
They got back together.
Havent heard the new album.
It wasnt all that bad.
Do you still love them?
I dont see how I cant ever love them
