I'm still bitter about George Lucas re-editing the middle three movies.
I don't blame you.  I don't think they added anything.
The worst part was at the end of Return of the Jedi.
Oh, when he put in Hayden Christensen?
Yeah - I never wanted to see him again.
Same here - he drained all the energy out of the room.
Plus, they changed the music at the end.  I liked the original song better.
You actually liked that song?  Ha!
In my defense, I was five when the original came out.
Now I have something new to hold against you.
