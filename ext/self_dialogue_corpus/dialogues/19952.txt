Do you consider U2 Classic Rock?
Depends on their catalogue.
Well since they are still performing can their music be played as such?
Sure but I dont know if I would play all U2 songs.
So would you say the Joshua Tree is now on play at classic rock stations?
Definitely though its hard to believe.
I remember when they first burst onto the scene.
I belive they can be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame soon if not already.
Yeah I think you have to wait 25 years from a first record release.
They definitely satisfy that requirement.
Alot of bands can be inducted into that hall of fame nowadays.
Crazy to think.
Well as we get older, theres nothing you can do.
I dont see their music as classic rock though.
Sure you dont, I actually do though.
I think classic rock has a certain sound.
No one sets out to play that kind of music.
So you think it evolves?
No, I think you just get it from having longevity.
So what happens afterwards? Those bands just get put out to pasture.
