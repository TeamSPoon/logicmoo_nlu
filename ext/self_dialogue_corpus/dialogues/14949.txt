One of my favorite Will Ferrell movies is Elf.
I love that movie! I could watch it over and over again.
Me too! And as a matter of fact I have.
He is so funny! His facial expressions and the way he acts as Buddy the Elf.
I love the shower scene myself when he was singing.
That was good, but so was the part when he called the midget angry in the board meeting.
Yes that was hysterical.
That is my favorite Christmas movie.
Mine too. I start watching it right after Thanksgiving.
I do too. Will Ferrell is really funny.
