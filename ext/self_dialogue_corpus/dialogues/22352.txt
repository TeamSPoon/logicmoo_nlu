So, what mainstream movie did you like, that almost no one else did?
The Grey, definitely.
Oh, I saw that--The revenge of the wolves. Hated it.
But it's great work. Why?
Well, you'll admit it's not exactly cheerful.
It's not. But I know you liked All is Lost, and that's pretty grim.
Yeah, but there's just one guy in danger. It's not a group dying one-by-one, gruesomely.
Dreadfully, you're right about that.
And you just about know it's hopeless, all along.
I didn't. They kept me hoping to the end.
Oh. Did you see that film where the couple gets left behind by hte diving boat, and they finally die? Did you like that?
No, I didn't. It was gimmicky, The Grey is not.
But it's the same idea. Death is gonna get you,  no matter what you do.
That's true, but the Grey is better written, better made, better in general. That other thing was merely sensationalist.
Maybe you're right. I can't even remember the name of the other one.
And Liam Neeson actually acts. Not that he ever has to, people love him anyway.
Yeah, but he's sort of a generic outdoorsman in this, really.
That's not generic, that's everyman. Like Tom Hanks, like James Stewart.
You're kidding. Everyman?
Yep. He's showing us how to die right.
