Is there really any good music from the 1930s anymore?
Of course! I think Lead Belly was from the 1930s.
Who was Lead Belly? The name is great!
He was a blues singer in the early 20th-century. He was erratic.
A lot of good songwriters are.
Kurt Cobain covered Lead Belly.
I know he did a blues session in the early 1990s. What did he cover?
He covered "Where Did You Sleep Last Night" on his MTV album.
Did he cover anything else by him?
I don't think so but he also did an electric version of the song.
Where can you hear that?
It's on a few bootlegs of concerts. It might be online now.
Which bootlegs? Do you know?
I think it was on one of the Outsecticides but I'm not sure which.
Are they on iTunes? How does the copyright work with that.
That's a good question. I think it is on iTunes.
Did you collect the CDs?
Of Outsecticide? Yes, I had a few in the early 1990s.
Cool! My wife loves the Dylan bootlegs.
I think they were authorized by the label.
