So.....do you think that baseball players still retaliate against each other?
You mean like throwing balls and bats at players?
Yeah.  Like what happened between the Braves and Blue Jayes
Oh yeah.  What was the deal with that?  Bautista seemed like he was looking for something.
When he smashed that homer and ran the bases Jace Peterson and Kurt Suzuki both said something to him.
And then on Thursday Teheran was trying to nail Bautista on the plate.
What was that first pitch, 94 mph?
Yep, and it barely missed him.  Then his second throw, the one that hit Bautista, was recorded at 95 mph!
The blue Jays crushed the Braves Thursday night.
Sure did!  With 3 in the first and 6 more in the second two innings!
I wonder what Teheran was thinking about when he was pitching?
Seemed like he would have been better off keeping his mind on the game instead of getting back at Bautista.
Even after he got hit the first time, the second time at bat he killed it again with a double!
Yeah, he sure wasn't intimidated by Teheran!
These are grown men.  You'd think they would be over trying to get even with one another.
Right?  It's not like it's sand lot baseball!
What would have happened it one of his own players had gotten hurt?
The Braves would have really been sucking wind then!
All in all, let's just be grown ups and play ball here, okay?
Sounds good to me!  Steerike!!
