Are you aware of a movie called Sea of Love?
Is that from the '80s?
Yes, it's from the late '80s.  It's a thriller/romance.
That sounds like something I'd seek out.  Who's in it?
Al Pacino and Ellen Barkin are in it.  They play off each other well.
Don't they have some pretty sexy scenes together?
Yes, they do.  Not too explicit, though.
Oh, that's good.  I don't like the ones that go too far with that sort of thing.
Anyway, Al Pacino is a detective, and there is a murder investigation going on.
I like crime-type movies.
It's set in New York which is a great city as a backdrop for this sort of thing.
I agree.  New York cop stuff is the best.
You'll like Ellen Barkin's character, too.  She's mysterious in it.
You're making me want to see this a lot!
Yes, it's worth seeking out.  Pacino is pretty compelling.
Does it have a lot of violence in it?
It has some, but not too much.
That's great.  I can't stand it when there's too much killing and car chases.
It will transport you for a while into that New York City crime world.
I think I'd love to see this.
