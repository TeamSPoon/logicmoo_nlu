How can you be a Patriot fan?
Come on, they have created a dynasty!
Yeah but at what cost?
Don't be a hater
Well then don't support cheaters
Cheaters?! They just have a lot of great players, that's why they beat your team.
Bill Belichick literally said, " if you're not cheating you're not really trying" so don't pretend they don't cheat.
Hey, the get rings.
Yes but we'll never know if they would have won them without cheating.
Brady, Gronk, stats don't lie, they are stacked with phenomenal players
I agree, I'll never doubt that, but we can't know just how good because of the cheating that they were caught doing and confessed to. There is probably more we'll never even know about
They probably would have still won all of those Super Bowls
I think so too. But we'll never KNOW. worse yet is that Brady, Belichick, the whole Patriots team will never know,
I guess you're right, that would drive me crazy to not know without a shadow of a doubt that I was the best team, player of all time.
Right, people will always dispute that and with just cause.
Man that's got to stink, because they are all so good
I agree, but you know what? It's not just a stain on the patriots organization
No one else was implicated in the cheating
No, but the NFL didn't really punish them justly so a lot of people have lost interest and respect for the game
You have a point. It's the fight among America
