What happened to 50 Cent?
Not sure he sort of disappeared
Yeah he was on top of the rap game for awhile
He rode the coattails of Eminem
I think he held up on his own
He sort of did.
I think he could have tried better
Did he produce any of his albums?
Eminem? I am sure he helped out on some.
I know he had guest spots
