Did you watch that scary movie with Jennifer Love Hewitt in it?
The one from the 90s?  Was it called I Know What You Did Last Summer?
Ah, yes, that is the one.  They ran over a guy on the road while drinking.
Freddie Prinze Jr is in it with Sarah Michelle Gellar too.
I always liked the fact that they are now married.  Still sad that Sarah died in the movie though.
She could have made it too if she just ran a little faster to the parade.
What about the death of her sister and the character Johnny Galecki played?
I was confused about them dying since they had nothing to do with the accident.
I suppose the killer doesn't have to have a moral compass.
True.  Had some great jump scares without too more gore.
