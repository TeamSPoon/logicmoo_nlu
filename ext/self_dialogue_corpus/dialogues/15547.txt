Do you have any bands that you secretly love but are afraid to admit?
One haha - but they're not together any longer.
Ok, spill - what is it?
The group is called Sugababes
Where are they from?
They're from the UK, British.
What kind of music did they make?
Oh it was solid girl-pop.
Wow, did they ever have any big hits?
A whole bunch of them, mostly in the UK.
Did they ever break into the US market?
Not really, they had a few songs near the end that were released in the US but the group broke up before they made their big push into the US
Interesting - was it a big group?
There were three women in the group, but the group changed out singers quite a bit.
Like Menudo?
Kind of, just smaller in scale, and British.
What is your favorite song?
I love Push the Button, its really my favorite.
Why did they break up?
Oh a bunch of infighting and stuff - the group had no original members left by the time it ended.
