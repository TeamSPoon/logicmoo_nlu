Do you remember when the Beatles came to America.
Sure, it was on the television.
I remember all of the boys started growing out their hair.
Yeah, I remember singing "she loves me yah yah yah".
That song was really popular.
I heard Elvis liked the Beatles music.
I heard that too. I think he met them.
I really had a crush on Paul.
I thought Ringo was so cool.
I like the British accent.
