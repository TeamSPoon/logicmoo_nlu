Everyone goes on about how great Frozen is but Tangled is so much better.
So true. "When will my life begin" is just the best song again.
Is that when she's cleaning the floor with her hair.
Yeah, so unhygenic.
Well in Rapunzel's defence she was locked in a tower her entire life with just her hair and an evil witch.
True, also what is it with Disney and evil witches?
What do you mean?
All the villains are evil witches.
Sometimes they're evil animals.
And sometimes the villain is just mankind.
