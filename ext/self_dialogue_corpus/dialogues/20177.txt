Have you seen Split?
No I don't think I have even heard of it.
Do you like horror or suspense movies?
Depends. I don't like slasher films too much.
You may like this one. It's bloody but not too much of it.
What's it about?
It's about a guy with a ton of personalities that kidnaps some girls and they try to escape.
How do his personalities come into play?
They have to figure out which personalities will help them get out.
Oh wow that sounds really scary.
It is, in a psychological way.
Is it gory?
Not too much. There are a few scenes but overall, no.
Are there any big name actors in it?
No. I did recognize the main character but I can't remember from what.
I hate it when that happens.
Well he is amazing in it. He truly transforms into each person.
That's hard to do as an actor I'm sure.
Yeah he truly makes the hairs on your arm stand up.
I'll have to check it out for sure.
