Do you believe you have a spirit animal like the patronus in Harry Potter?
I do, I believe mine is a black cat.
I think mine is a tiger, just based on what I feel and my affinity with them.
That was such a powerful moment when Harry called on his patronus to defeat the death eaters.
They were some scary characters huh? I heard J.K. Rowling thought them up while she was depressed.
Oh I believe that, it shows. The Prisoner of Azkaban was a really dark movie.
It was for sure one of the darkest. But I think it helped her defeat her own demons.
That was a great movie, I loved the way they turned back time and were able to see themselves in the past.
I love that part, really any movie with that subject or theme appeals to me.
Same here. Hermione was so clever during that whole segment.
