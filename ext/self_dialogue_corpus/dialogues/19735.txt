What do you think of the Lumineers?
I really like them, actually.
I agree. I feel that they are very talented.
Yeah, and I'm really not into the whole Indie Folk genre.
There is something about their style that is appealing to me.
I agree, they have almost this country vibe, you know?
Like they wouldn't be out of place in 1940's Appalachia, I agree
Yes! I think it's the Banjo!
What is your favorite song by them?
I really like "Stubborn Love"
Oh, from their debut album. I really like "Ophelia" from their latest album that came out last year
That is another great tune
I was fortunate enough to see them in concert once
Where was that?
At the Firefly Music Festival, back in 2014
How were they?
They were great live. They sound like they were right off the album.
That's good to hear. I've been told their lead singer has a great voice.
Yes, and the female singer, Neyla Pekarek features heavily live. More so than on the albums.
Interesting - I always felt they underutilized her!
