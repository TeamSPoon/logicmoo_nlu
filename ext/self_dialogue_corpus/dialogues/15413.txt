How do you feel about Anna Kendrick?
Oh, she was the one in Pitch Perfect right?
Yes, she has a beautiful acapella voice. She sings the song Cups.
Yes, with the cups!
She also does a duet with Justin Timberlake on the Trolls soundtrack.
Really, I haven't heard it.
They do the song True Colors.
Like the song Cyndi Lauper sang?
Exactly. They do a beautiful version.
I will look it up.
I do like singers that have voices that can harmonize like they do.
I bet that took a lot of practice.
Maybe, but maybe their voices just blended easily.
Was it better than the original?
To me it was.
That is not often the case.
I think that it was so good they should work on other songs together.
Justing Timberlake works with many diffierent artists.
Yeah, he is able to tackle many different genres.
Sounds like she may be abe to as well.
