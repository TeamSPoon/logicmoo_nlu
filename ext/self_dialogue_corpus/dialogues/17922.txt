Hey what is that song you are listening to?
Oh, it is Beat It by Michael Jackson.
You like Michael Jackson.
Of course, he is like the greatest pop singer of all time.
Oh goodness no! That has got to go to Justin Timberlake.
Are you kidding me? Michael Jackson has had way more hits than him.
What are some of his biggest hits?
That is a tough question because all of his songs have become number one hits.
What are his most popular songs that you think everyone has probably heard of?
There is Billie Jean, Man in the Mirror, Black or White, Bad, You Are Not Alone, and of course Thriller.
I will give it to you that Thriller is a good song and an even better video but I still would pick Timberlake over Jackson.
What are some of Justin Timberlake's biggest hits?
Are you talking about his hits alone or are you including when he was with N'Sync?
No, just his own hits without the group.
Well there is Can't Stop the Feeling, Cry Me A River, True Colors, Hair Up, and Sexy Back.
Those songs do not come close to comparing to any of Michael Jackson's songs!
I admit that Michael Jackson had many classic hits but overall I would have to say Timberlake is better.
If Michael Jackson was still around would be able to take on Timberlake any day of the week.
I don't think this is something that we will ever agree on.
Yeah, I guess we will just have to agree to disagree.
