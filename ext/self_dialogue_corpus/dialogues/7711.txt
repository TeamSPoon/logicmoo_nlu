What did you think of Dobby?
I hated Dobby, he was so annoying.
I know, basically that movies version of Jar Jar Binks.
He wasn't that bad.  And it was sad when he was killed.
Yeah, that was sad.
But he helped everyone escape.  So his sacrifice was not in vain.
Yes, not only was he a free elf, he was  brave elf.
Come to think about it, maybe I actually like Dobby.
Yeah, even though he was a bit annoying he was still a good elf.
Poor poor Dobby.
