I just saw A Hard Day's Night on TV. I had forgotten how many good songs where in it.
What is on that album. I forgot.
Well there is the title song obviously, but also "I Should Have Known Better".
Okay, what else?
I'm Happy Just to Dance with You and This Boy.
This Boy? What's that?
That is the Ringo's theme from the  movie.
I don't remember that one.
It's on the Hard Day's Night album in North America, but not in the United Kingdom.
Okay, maybe I should stream it and see if I remember it.
