Are you a fan of Frank Ocean?
Not really. I don't really like R&B.
I think you should give him a shot.
Why? I said I don't like R&B.
He's not doesn't make the typical kind of R&B music you're thinking of though.
Well what kind is it then?
It's a combination of classic R&B elements but more modernized.
That just sounds like you're describing The Weeknd.
No, The Weeknd is more pop R&B, whereas Frank Ocean combines R&B, soul, and incredible lyrics and storytelling.
I see. I'm still not really convinced.
Didn't you say you value meaning and lyrical ability in music, rather than just what sounds good?
Yeah, but if I don't like the genre, then I can't enjoy the music.
Fair enough. However, I'm telling you that Frank Ocean makes music in a genre that you've never even heard before.
I guess I could give him a listen, but I don't have high expectations.
Good. Then you'll probably be blown away.
What song should I listen to?
You have to listen to a whole album to get the full effect. His albums have strong themes and each song leads into the next one.
Well what's his best album?
He has two studio albums. One is called Channel Orange and the other is called Blonde. Pick one of those and you are set.
Channel Orange sounds interesting. I'll try that first.
