How much do you know about the Beatles and their spouses?
I can hold my own when it comes to the Beatles.
Okay. What Beatle had a wife named Yoko Ono?
Piece of cake that would be John Lennon.
For five hundred points if you can tell me if John and Ono had children A. Was that child male or female and B. What is the child’s name.
That piece of Beatles trivia is worth more than 500 points. However, John and Yoko’s child is a male and his name is Julian.
True or False? Paul McCarthey wrote songs for the Beatles with his wife?
That's true.
Is it true that both John Lennon and Paul McCarthey of Beatles wives are still living?
No that’s not true. John’s wife Yoko is the only one of the two still living.
