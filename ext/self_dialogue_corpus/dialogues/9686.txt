Do you like rap music?
It depends.
I like the old school stuff.
Me too - Cypress Hill and Public Enemy.
I went to see an Eminem concert.
His lyrics are pretty good too.
Tech Nine also has some interesting lyrics.
I would go to see him.
Rappers now are so fast talking it's almost absurd.
Sort of keeps them from getting the point across.
