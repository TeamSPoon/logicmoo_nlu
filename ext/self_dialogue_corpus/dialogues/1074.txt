People like system analysts, chemists score 32 and 31 respectively.
So Davis' score is pretty good. He's a pretty smart guy.
Yes, but that's good and bad, the only person who got the perfect score, McInally, wasn't drafted until the fifth round
That's weird
Well, NFL doesn't like either extremes. Can';t be too dumb, can't be too smart.
A lot of the QBs are in the high 30s to low 40s though.
Yep, Think the highest amongst the QBs is Ryan Fitzpatrick with 48 which 2 points below perfect score.
Why do the NFL use it anyway? What does it even test?
Oh, it's a basic IQ test. 50 questions meant to be answered in 12 minutes.
Why such a short time?
It was just designed that way.
Weird.
Not so weird if it's consistent at rankign the individuals on certain traits liek reasoning, rationality, learnign ability etc.
How is that even relevant to football?
it's relevant to ALL occupations. FGootball invoves learning, reasoning like all other occupations
You just run with the ball, it's not that hard.
Well, actually it IS hard. There is alot of split rational deiciosn you havbe tomake in terms of which way to run, how to cut, when to cut
Huh. I would've never thought of football as a decision making process.
Well you do now.
Guess you live and learn.
