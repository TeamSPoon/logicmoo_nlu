I love rock and roll music!
No duh! Every shirt you own was from a rock concert!
Yeah baby!
I don't know if I should ask this, considering your recent interest in Boyz II Men, but tell me, what is your all-time favorite band?
Oooooh...tough one. I don't think I can answer that question.
Ok then. So, what are some of your favorite rock bands?
Genesis, with Phil Collins...One of the few drummers that can carry a tune.
Nice.
Kansas, with Kerry Livgren...and Styxx, perhaps my all-time favorite!
Very good!  You have restored my confidence in your judgement.
