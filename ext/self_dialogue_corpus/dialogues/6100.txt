So is it just Disney animation you like then?
Pretty much.
Like Beauty and the Beast and The Little Mermaid?
Yes, I think the music is always great too
I only know a few songs, like Be Our Guest
You like Reggae so you would love the Little Mermaid soundtrack
I'll check it out. Do you like the new movies like Frozen?
Not as much. The songs are good but too much hype
Yes I see Frozen stuff everywhere
Yes and they are not as good as the classics to me anyway
