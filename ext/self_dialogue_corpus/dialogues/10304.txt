Did you like the terminator Genysis?
I think it was a far cry from the old one.
Well, they did change the whole time line about a dozen times.
The feel was off though, not just the plot.
I liked Matt Smith in it.
He was really good, I was surprised when he turned into a bad guy.
He was a sleeper cell, he was bad the whole time.
I was surprised by his being bad in general.
Do you think they will make new ones?
I think they already are.
