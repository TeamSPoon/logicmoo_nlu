Did you watch The Mighty Ducks as a kid?
Yes, but I mainly watched D2: The Mighty Ducks because I had a copy on VHS.
I loved all those movies, they made me interested in ice hockey even though I'm Australian.
I heard they named a real team after the movies, is that true?
Yes, there is a professional ice hockey team named The Anaheim Ducks.
The kid who played Charlie in those movies went onto to bigger things didn't he? Like Dawson's Creek or something?
Yes, he was also in that show called Fringe. His name is Joshua Jackson.
I haven't seen Emilio Estevez in anything else since he played the coach in these movies, have you?
No, he was in these three Mighty Ducks movies then seemed to disappear.
I think he's been in a few things but I guess he retired.
