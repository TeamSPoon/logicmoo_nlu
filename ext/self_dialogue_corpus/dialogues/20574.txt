Grease was my daughters favorite movie in high school.
Oh that movie was great!!
She knew every word by heart.
John Travolta and Olivia Newton John, what a good pair.
Yes Sandy and Danny.
I like Rizzo too, she was one tough cookie.
Yea , who played her?
It was Stockard Channing.
Oh yea, I have seen her in other movies as well.
Yea she was in charge of the Pink Ladies.
That is right.
I love the transformation of Sandy at the end of the movie.
Yea she looked great.
Boy I wonder if high school was really like that in the fifties?
I don't think so.
There was a lot of good music in that movie.
You are right.
I am going to go home at watch it.
I think I will too.
Great!
