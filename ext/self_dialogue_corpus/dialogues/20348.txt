Do you have any movies with Jim Carrey?
Yes, I have The Majestic, which is really good.
Oh, I've heard about that one! Isn't that the one where he has that green mask?
No, that's a different one. This one is actually a pretty serious drama movie.
Really? What's it about?
It's about the main guy, who Jim plays, who gets into an accident and loses his memory.
What else happens?
After he loses his memory, he wanders into a town and accidentally assumes the identity of someone else who's been missing for a long time.
Wow, that's a really cool idea. Sounds stressful.
It definitely gets stressful later on, because you get afraid that the people will find out that he isn't who he thinks he is.
That's quite a plot.
There's a lot of other cool stuff that happens too, like he somehow becomes really good at piano by just trying to remember how to play even though he never learned.
Interesting. Are there any romance parts?
There's a pretty big romance that goes on, which also gets stressful because she doesn't know that he isn't the guy who has been missing.
I'm not sure I would be able to handle that amount of stress.
It gets nearly unbearable honestly, but it's got a great ending.
Is it at least a happy one?
I would say so, basically he remembers that he was in an accident and that he isn't who he thought he was.
What happens after he remembers?
He tells the people in the town and they decided to accept him anyways after they discuss.
