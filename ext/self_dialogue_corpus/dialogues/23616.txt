Do you think Happy Gilmore is a sports movie?
Not really.
More of just a comedy?
Yeah I would classify it as such.
I am trying to compile a list of the best sports movies.
Gee, you cant add Major League to that either.
That was number 3 on my list.
I mean it would be tough cause it was a comedy too.
You can have a funny sports movie.
I guess I would put it in there then.
Yeah sometimes you need that brevity in a film to make it good.
What is your top movie?
I have Miracle as the best.
Not a bad film.
I think the acting was great.
It was an awesome depiction of those events.
Yeah thats why I have it ranked so high.
Kurt Russell did a fantastic job.
Even though it was just a reenactment I felt like it was novel.
It was no one had ever done that.
