Did you ever see Jaco Pastorius when he was with Weather Report?
No, just heard the CDs.
They were good on record, and brilliant live.
Wish I could have seen them!
I saw them at the Playboy Jazz Festival in the early 80s.
Must've been epic.
They performed three times, all with Jaco. He performed without the band, too.
With his "Word of Mouth" band?
Yeah, and backing Joni Mitchell at the first Playboy Fest when she was doing Mingus stuff.
I vaguely remember that. I wasn't ready for her doing jazz.
You had a lot of company. I think her Mingus album sold fewer copies than anything she had ever done.
People want to hear what they're used to.
Which puts artist in a kind of prison.
Especially the most creative ones.
His last hurrah at Playboy was legendary -- not in a good way.
How was it?
I thought it was great, but he was clearly marching to his own drummer, so to speak.
High?
Everybody thought so, including me. I couldn't believe he could play so brilliantly while impaired. Turns out it was probably his demons taking over.
I wonder how much they informed his music?
