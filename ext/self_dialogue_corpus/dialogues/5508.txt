Have you seen the movie Moana?
Yes, it was great! I loved it!
Me too! What was your favorite part?
I think my favorite scene was the song with the turtle. What was yours?
Mine was towards the end when Moana was returning the heart back to Ne Fiti.
That was a great scene, especially the slow motion part.
I really want to watch it again. Did you have a favorite character?
I did. I really loved Hei Hei, the chicken.
That chicken was hilarious! I really loved Maui.
Maui was great. The Rock did an awesome job voicing his part.
