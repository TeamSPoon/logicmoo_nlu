Hey Bo, did you by chance record that football game from a few days ago.
Oh yeah, was it the Saints game?
It was indeed, them vs. the Colts I believe.
I got it, I am actually glad you asked me to record it.
Why is that bro?
It was an excellent game, the Saints have a great squad.
Oh definitely, I root for them every time out.
What is that young running back's name who is an absolute play maker?
There are a few, but maybe Hightower?
Oh yeah Hightower is incredible!
He definitely goes on runs when he wants to.
Him and the quarterback seem to have good synergy.
I can't disagree, you definitely did enjoy the game.
I did, and can you remind me of the quarterback's name.
Drew Brees, he will go down as an all time great.
Oh surely, I remember when the Saints weren't that great but that has all changed.
They are definitely a formidable squad now.
We see eye to eye, come through and we can watch the game.
You wouldn't mind watching it again?
Not at all, I'm a Saints fan now!
