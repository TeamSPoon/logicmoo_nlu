Are you excited for the Texans this coming season?
Yes and no.
Why no?
It's hard to get excited about Tom Savage being QB.
I feel you there.
I'm more excited about the future of the team with Watson under helm:
I think most of the city of Houston is.
Hopefully Watson starts next season and the defense still has a few years left.
That would be the perfect scenario.
I just want to see a Championship here in Houston.
Yeah. Even the Oilers could't bring one home.
Nope. Only been a NBA title here in Houston. We need something else!
Hopefully Clowney can have another great season.
I hope so. He was a best last season.
He made Tom Brady look like a rag doll in the playoffs.
One of the only bright spots in that game.
I wouldn't want him chasing me down!
Yeah, I'd be scared as heck.
Plus, Watt coming back this season?
Yeah I'm excited about that.
