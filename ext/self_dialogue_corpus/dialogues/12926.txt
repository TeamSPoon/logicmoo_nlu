Do you think they will replace Carrie Fisher in the next Star Wars Movie?
I don't know who else could play Leia.  She passed so suddenly.
Yes, they may have to remove Leia from the plot in the upcoming film.
Perhaps they will kill off Leia in the next film, since Fisher is gone.
Perhaps.  Do you think they might bring back Han Solo?
He was killed in "The Force Awakens".
Yes, but is he really dead, or will there be a sci-fi "resurrection"?
I don't know, but I wouldn't mind seeing Harrison Ford in the film.
Me too, but Solo is the only character he could play.
Yes.  Perhaps he will after death like Yoda and Kenobi did at the end of "Return of the Jedi"
