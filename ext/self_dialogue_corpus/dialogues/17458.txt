You know what kind of songs I really enjoy?
What is that?
I really enjoy songs that are actually just funny.
Well there are a lot of those. Have you heard "Paradise By The Dashboard Light" by Meatloaf?
I have and that song is very funny.
What is your favorite funny song?
I really like a few of Blake Shelton's songs.
What are the titles?
There is "She's Got A Way With Words" and "Honey Bee".
I don't think Honey Bee is really a comedy, just kind of a cutesy song.
True, it just strikes me funny.
Have you heard "Pray for You" by Jarron and the Long Road to Love?
I don't believe so.
It is written by someone who says they pray for their ex all the time.
Well that doesn't sound very funny.
Well, it is what they pray for that is the funny part.
Why? What do they pray for?
Well one line is "I pray your brakes go out rolling down a hill and a flower pot falls from your window sill to knock you in the head like I'd like to."
Wow, that is almost plain mean.
Well, yeah, but it is funny as well.
