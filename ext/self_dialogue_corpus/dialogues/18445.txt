Do you remeber the Buggles.
The who?
They wrote that song Video Killed the Radio Star.
That was a cool song.
It was covered by The Presidents.
You know what's so funny about that song.
What?
It was the first video on MTV.
Ha! They didn't get it right though.
How do you mean?
Well, MTV doesn't play hardly any videos anymore.
Yeah, all reality TV garbage. What of it.
The radio is still plenty popular.
True.
Just kind of funny.
Dripping with irony.
I miss the Presidents.
Me too.
They were an awesome band.
Very bizzar for sure.
