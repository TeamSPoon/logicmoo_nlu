Have you heard the new album by the infamous Drake?
Yes! 'More to Life' is at the top of the charts! I love it!
I think it's one of his best ones yet.
I agree, it's so diverse and he even collaborated with Black Coffee in that one song!
Are you talking about 'Get It Together'?
Yes that one! With Jorja Smith as well.  It's a really great hit.
Drake always comes through. Let's talk about Chance The Rapper!
My man! He is beyond amazing.  I love his new album, 'Coloring Book.'
Me too. I especially like the song 'Smoke Break' with Future.
That collaboration is awesome! I am loving his entire album.
