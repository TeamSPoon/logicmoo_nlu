How do you think the Cowboys will do this year?
I don't think they will be great.
So you think they will be good?
They are always good, but I don't think they can win the Super Bowl.
They finally got rid of Tony Romo.
Tony Romo has been overrated his whole career.
Romo has been a good quarterback.
He's always injured!
Well, if the Cowboys had a good offensive he wouldn't get injured.
The Cowboys have a really good offensive line.
Then why was Romo always injured?
I think it's because some players are just injury prone.
What do you think about Dak Prescott?
Hard to tell after 1 year.
I think Dak will be a good quarterback.
I think he will be good but I need to see another year to really say.
Didn't Dak get in trouble this off season?
Yeah, for using a robot to sign his autograph.
Well, at least, it wasn't something like drugs.
Yeah for a Cowboys player using a robot to sign your autograph is pretty tame.
