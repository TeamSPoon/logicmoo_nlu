Have you seen the new Pirate movie?
No, I've only seen the original.
Oh, you should see it! It was really great.
I really like Johnny Depp.
Me, too! He nails the character.
Is it scary? My daughter doesnI't like scary movies.
It's not that bad, but very sensitive kids might be bothered.
I think we'll wait until it's on video.
That's a good idea. Then you can always turn it off.
I'll do that. I'm glad you liked it, though!
