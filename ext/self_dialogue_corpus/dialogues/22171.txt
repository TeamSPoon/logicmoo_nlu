I saw a movie called One Week the other day.
How was it?
It was inspirational. I was moved.
Wow!  I'll have to rent it.
You should. It's amazing.
What's it about?
A guy is diagnosed with cancer and takes a trip.
Where to?
He drives a motorcycle across Canada.
Amazing. I would love to do that.
Me too. The scenery looks beautiful.
What else happens?
He learns about life and its true meaning.
Nice! Who's in it.
Joshua Jackson I think.
The guy from Dawson's Creek.
Yeah.  He played Pacey.
I remember him.
It got me thinking about life.
I have to see it.
