What was the last concert you saw ?
I just watched a paul simon concert on tv last night.
Oh that's cool, I also enjoyed his music myself.
Ya I loved his whole graceland album most.
Was that the concert?
No, it was a more recent one in a park somewhere maybe new york.
oh cool. I love outdoor concert venues.
Me too. I recently attended an outdoor concert in Florida.
Oh ya? which one? Weather must have been great.
It was warm and sunny just like you would want. It was a third eye blind concert.
Oh wow, I almost forgot they existed.
Hey they are still a great band.
Remind me what were thier big song hits?
"Deep Inside of You" "If There Ever Was A Time" "Jumper" "How's It Going to Be" just to name some of them.
They did have a number, now that you point them out again I can recall all of those.
It was pretty neat to see them and got fairly close too.
Where in Florida?
It was in clearwater at coachman park, really cool outdoors right on the water.
That sounds like it would be an awesome place, outside of scientologists.
Funny, I think one of their buildings is right there. Kind of creepy to me.
