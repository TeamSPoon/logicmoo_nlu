My favorite Christmas movie of all times is "Die Hard."
"Die Hard" isn't a Christmas movie, it's an action-adventure movie.
It takes place at Christmas. That makes it a Christmas movie.
Fine. Name me one other Christmas movie with guns and explosions in it. If you can do that, I'll admit "Die Hard" is a Christmas movie.
That's too easy. "Home Alone." I bet you think of that as a Christmas movie, don't you?
"Home Alone" is a movie aimed at the entire family. Yes, It's got some action-adventure in it but it's for the entire family.
And I think "Die Hard" is a great movie for the entire family. I think you have a bias against Action-Adventure movies. Don't you want your children to be able to recognize a European scum terrorist/thief?
Honestly, no, that isn't one of my biggest concerns. I love action-adventure movies. I love "Die Hard." But "Die Hard" is Not a Christmas movie.
It Takes place at Christmas. That makes it a Christmas movie.
You're weird!
