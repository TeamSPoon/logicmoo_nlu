I really love Mary J Blige.
Who is that again?
She's an amazing singer!
I get that but I mean name one of her songs.
Okay, one of the best is "Family Affair."
Not sure if I know that one or not.
Another great one was "Be Without You."
Now that one I remember! It came out when I was graduating high school.
Yes it was such a pretty song.
I love her voice.
I actually still listen to her music to this day.
Me too. I have a lot of her music downloaded onto my phone.
You just do not hear voices like hers.
She's truly a special soul.
When did her first album come out?
It's been years let me think.
I know she's been around for quite some time.
Okay, her first album came out in 1992. It was called "What's the 411?"
That actually doesn't sound familiar to me.
She's released 13 studio albums. Wow, that's impressive.
