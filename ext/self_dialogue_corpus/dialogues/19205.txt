July is always a good month to catch music concerts, and Indianapolis, Indiana has 2 different music festivals in July.
Indianapolis is easy to get to from the Chicago area, thanks to I-65 Southbound, it only takes about three and a half hours.
They are having a Jazz In The Park Summer Concert Series at Watkins Park,
I like music performances in parks in the summer. It's so relaxing.
They have three dates scheduled, one for each of the next three months.
What else is happening down there?
They are having The Wide Eyed Music Festival July 28-29. It's to show appreciation for all the local musicians.
What kind of music are they playing?
It's a wide variety of different styles and acts.
Variety is always nice because then there's something for everyone.
They have a Facebook page up for it, and they're calling it a Wide Eyed Party.
Oh my, that sounds a little rowdy.
Probaby will be a bit rowdy, it's being held at the Fountain Square Brewery. The two day passes go on sale this Friday for $15.
That's really cheap!
It's local bands that probably haven't had much success.
Indianapolis isn't the same as being a musician in Chicago.
Nope, it's sure not. Lots more connections and big time people up in Chicago.
I think I might pass on this one. I wanted a quiet relaxing summer, not hanging around a frantic trying to be someone group.
What do you think about the Jazz in the Park concerts?
That I would be interested in. Go down and have something to eat first and a glass of wine, and then go sit on a blanket in a park and listen to soulful jazz- that sounds more my speed.
