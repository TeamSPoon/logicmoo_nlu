I like the animated Beauty and the Beast better I think
Not me, I have parts of both the animated and the new one I really like
So are you saying you couldn't pick a favorite?
Probably not easily. I mean, they are not even both the same type, like both cartoons or whatever.
I guess I see your point, I just grew up watching the old animation.
So did I, and I love it, always will. The new one just brings the story to life in a whole new way for me.
Oh I will agree with you there. Some moments I was just ear to ear grinning and right on the edge of my seat.
I will admit, and maybe it's just my age, but I don't see myself watching this one as many times as I watched the animated as a child.
True, but like you said, probably more of an age thing, we don't have the time anymore.
We should make time, have a disney movie night.
