My daughter is addicted to Finding Dory. She requests that movie every Friday for movie night.
I agree that it's a great movie. I love Hank. He is so funny!
At least she's gotten over her Frozen phase. I don't have to listen to "Let It Go" a billion times anymore.
I hear you. My daughter is now singing Moana songs instead. I guess it's still a refreshing change.
What's the new Disney animated movie that's coming out this year?
I think it's Coco. It's a Pixar film. I think Cars 3 is coming out this year too.
Man, I can't keep track of them anymore. It's nice that Pixar is doing some original stuff.
Yeah, I was getting a little worried that all they had left were sequels - Cars, Nemo, Monsters Inc.
Those are all great movies for both kids and adults. Some jokes just go right over the kids' heads but the adults laugh.
I think that's what makes those movies so popular. There's something for everyone.
