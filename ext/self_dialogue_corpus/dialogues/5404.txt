Did you know that Tron was a Disney offering?
I did not. The original was super 80s.
Completely. But ahead of its time in some ways.
I'm better familiar with the sequel.
It was serviceable. I liked Jeff Bridges and his de-aged clone Clu.
Yeah, but you're forgetting about the best part: Olivia Wilde as Quora.
Heh, good point, but that wasn't the best part.
Oh? Name something better.
The score. Daft Punk at its absolute finest.
I forgot about that - it was pretty epic wasn't it?
