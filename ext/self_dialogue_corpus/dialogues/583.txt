Are there any other countries that are interested in Football like we are in the USA?
I don't really think there are. Everyone else seems to like soccer.
Huh. It must be an American thing.
I guess so. Do you like football?
I do. I'm not the biggest fan in the world, but I like to watch sometimes.
What's your favorite team?
The 49ers. I grew up in San Francisco, so I watched them a lot as a kid.
That's funny, I grew up near there too, but I always liked the Raiders.
It's probably cooler to be a Raiders fan.
Why?
I don't know. It just gives off that image to me.
Huh. Well that makes me happy I guess.
Think they stand a chance at winning?
Now that we have Marshawn Lynch, I think it's possible.
Hmm. Well, I guess it'll be an exciting season then.
I know that I'll be following it closely.
Are you going to have any watch parties or anything?
I was thinking about it. Maybe for the first game?
You should! I'd come.
Great, then I will then!
