Are you ready for the Lions' season?
Yup! I hope they have a good team this year.
Me too. They always find ways to disappoint.
I just hope I can watch the games this year.
You don't watch the games?
Rarely.
Why not?
The stupid blackout policy the commissioner thinks is necessary.
What's that? I've always seen the games.
The NFL says that if a certain percentage of tickets aren't sold in the stadium, that local and regional airings of the game are blacked out.
Meaning what?
It doesn't air. At all.
What? That's not fair!
Right, I know.
Why do they have that policy?
Ticket sales. If everyone watches it at a bar or at home, the team makes far less money.
I get that, but it's still unfair.
Right, there's always a portion of the population who dies to go to the game to get the live experience.
Plus not everyone can afford the tickets.
I guarantee you if they make tickets far less expensive, they'll make the same amount of money and have all games sold out.
