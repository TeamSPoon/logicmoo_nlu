Did you ever listen to Lil Kim?
Oh wow, back in the day yes I definitely did!  She was one of my favorite female hip hop artists.
Yeah, mine too.  I don't think there was anyone who even compared.
Yeah, I was never a fan of Missy Elliot or any of her contemporaries.
I heard she got her start from Notorious B.I.G.  They did a lot of stuff together, too.
Yeah, I had heard that.  She's from Brooklyn, I believe.
Yeah, definitely.  She talks about that in a lot of her music.
Hard Core came out in 1996.  That was a great album.
I know, it had so many hits on it.  No Time, Not Tonight, and Crush on You were my favorites.
Oh yeah.  Those really stuck in your mind.
Didn't she win some Grammys?
She's won all kinds of awards!  She's not called the Queen of Hip-Hop for no reason!
Oh wow, yeah that's true I hadn't even thought of that.  That is her nickname, right?
Yes.  I think she said in some interview that Diana Ross inspired her.
That's hard to imagine, but yeah I guess she grew up in that time era.
Yeah, Diana Ross would probably be scandalized by Lil Kim.
You never know.  She was definitely very fashionable as well.
Yeah, a lot of people tried to imitate her style.
Didn't she go to prison or something?
I think she did a few times.  I'm not sure.
