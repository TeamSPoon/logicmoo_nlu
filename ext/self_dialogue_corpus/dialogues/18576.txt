Do you like a lot of music with piano?
Not really, though I haven't been exposed to a lot of it.
Most people have heard all those cliche classical songs that they use in movies.
Yeah, those are really the only ones that I can think of that have piano.
There's some really good instrumental music done by a guy called C418 that mainly uses piano.
Oh? What's the music sound like?
You wouldn't think it's really piano music, but each song has such a memorable melody and feel to it.
Wow, I'm surprised I haven't heard of them.
Yeah, a lot of people don't really know who he is.
How did you discover him?
Well, I really liked the music in Minecraft so I decided to look up who the artist was.
Oh wait, he did the Minecraft music?
Yeah! Lot's of people really like it but don't know about his other stuff.
Is his other stuff just as good?
Yes, I would say that there's stuff that's even better.
What are some of the good albums out by him?
I would definitely listen to One, that album was written for a documentary about Minecraft I believe.
Interesting, and I'll have to look that one up.
Yeah, that one and both the Alpha and Beta albums are the best ones out there.
I'll look those up on Youtube and give them a good listen.
