Have you caught up on your Harry Potter movies?
Yes! I finished it all last week.
I'm so glad! What did you think?
I thought it was so awesome.  I cannot believe Sirius Black died!
I know! He was such an influential person to Harry.
It was so sad! I cried!
What about Harry ending up with Ginny?
I totally saw that as a surprise.  I thought he would be with Cho Chang all the way.
Me too! I'm glad though since she is Ron's sister.
She definitely grew up into a beautiful young woman.
