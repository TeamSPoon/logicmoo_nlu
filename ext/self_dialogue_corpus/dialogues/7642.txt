Have you seen all of the Harry Potter movies yet?
Of course! I love them, although not as much as the books.
Which one is your favorite?
I love Order of the Phoenix. I think it has a more wholesome idea of adventure because of the TriWizard tournament.
Really? Voldemort killing Cedric is wholesome?
No, but you know what I mean! It's more adult than the earlier movies but it's still a bit more lighthearted.
That's true. The scene with Moaning Myrtle in the prefect's bathroom made me laugh.
Oh yeah, I almost forgot about that! My favorite scene might be when we meet the students from the other schools.
I wish things had worked out differently with Viktor Krum. He was so gorgeous!
Sooo dreamy. But Hermionie and Ron are meant to be!
