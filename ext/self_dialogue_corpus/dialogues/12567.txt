Would you change any cast member if you could?
I think the original actors were really perfect in the roles and brought it to what it is now.
It makes you wonder if kurt russell had been Han Solo would it have been as good?
Was he in the running for the part?
Yep he was considered.
I think harrison is so good as Han hard to imagine anyone doing it better!
Apparently harrison was brought in at  first just to feed lines to the auditioning actors.
I never heard that before.
Ya, George ended up loving his delivery to the actors and cast him in the end.
Wow! I am so glad he did.
