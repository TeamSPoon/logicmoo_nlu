What was the name of the actor who voiced the dog in Fox and the Hound?
The young dog or the older one?
The older one.
It was Kurt Russell.
Wow!  I thought he sounded familiar.
Yeah, I remember watching it and wondering where I've heard it before.
It makes sense.  I thought it sounded like him, but didn't for sure.
Kind of crazy really.  Who would have thought he would have voiced a Disney character?
That was long before he was popular.
I guess you could say maybe it launched his career.
