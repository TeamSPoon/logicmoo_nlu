Do you by any chance have a favorite character in the Fast & Furious movies?
Honestly, I really don't.
Seriously? I thought that everyone has a favorite character in that series.
Truth be told, I really don't have a favorite anything in that series.
But you told me that you watch those movies pretty much all the time.
That's true, but I don't know why.
That doesn't make sense.
Enough about me! Do you have a favorite character in it?
Yeah. Mine's Dominic.
It's because of Vin Diesel, isn't it?
