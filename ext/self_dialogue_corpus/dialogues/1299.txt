You bet i am I love spending my Sunday's watching football.
What does your wife thinking you watching football all day Sunday.
Oh she doesn't seem to mind she is a casual fan herself.
What do you mean by a casual fan.
Well she might warch a few mintues of the game and the go to something else.
Oh so not like us guys who park in front of the TV all day in the fall.
Exactly, but she does cheer for the Seahawks.
Well of course she does since you live in Seattle.
For some reason we have a lot of Oaklands fans her too.
I can't understand that.
Me either I mean Oakland hasn't even been that good before last  year.
So what chance do you think the Seahawks have this year?
I think they have a good chance as long as Russell Wilson stays healthy.
Yep, but will stay healthy if the Offensive line doesn't protect him better.
That my friend is the million dollar question.
Yeah I hope so I would hate to see him get taken out because they Seahawks woudn't put together a good offensice line.
No kidding; it has been a weakness for years you think they would fix it.
If the Seahawks wouldn't make do you have another team you watch.
Not really though since i was born in Indianapolis I do kinda cheer for them.
Well it shouild be a fun season no matter what happens.
