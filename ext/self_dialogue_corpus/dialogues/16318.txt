What is your favorite genre of music?
Rap, what about you?
Me too! Who's your favorite rapper?
Eminem, but I have a lot.
Yea, he's my personal favorite too. What was your favorite album?
The Eminem Show, everyone always says something different though.
Yea, mine was the Marshall Mathers LP.
That's what everyone says, and it's my second or third favorite.
What made Eminem Show so special?
I think it was just the time it came out, but really spoke to me, it's my favorite album of all time.
Well that would make sense then. That was the one with Cleaning Out My Closet right?
Yes it was, do you remember the first hit song from that album?
I thought was it?
Nope, Without Me was.
Oh yea that's right! Didn't Eminem dress up as Batman in that video?
No! He was Robin.
Yea that's right, I loved that song!
It was good, but nothing compared to the rest of the songs on that album.
What was your favorite song?
Hard to say, probably Til I Collapse.
