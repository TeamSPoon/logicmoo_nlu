Do you prefer the prequals or the original trilogy
The original
I liked them both, they were different
They prequals used the green screen too much
There were some cool shots done digitally, but some parts should have been kept the same, like yoda
Some of the enviroments could not have been done in the 70s.
They need to use the green screen as little as they can
The ships should not be cgi
I hope they are not afraid to add some interesting characters in the new films
It has gotten a little monotenous
