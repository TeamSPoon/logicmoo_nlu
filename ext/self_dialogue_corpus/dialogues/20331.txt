Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan make such a great movie couple.
I agree. I loved them in You've Got Mail.
Me too. They were also great in Sleepless in Seattle.
Totally. Have they been in any movies together recently?
The last I heard they both starred in Ithaca.
Oh. I've never heard of it.
I've never seen it. I don't think it was well received by critics.
That's too bad.
Yeah, at least we still have Joe versus the Volcano.
Wow. They really have been in a lot of movies together haven't they?
Yeah. I love when actors work on multiple projects together.
Me too. Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly are a great duo.
I love when they keep saying 'Shake n Bake' in Talledaga Nights.
Me too. They are even better in Stepbrothers.
Oh definitely. It's so funny when their bunkbeds collapse on each other.
Haha. What do you think of Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson starring together?
I think they're great. I want to see Zoolander 2.
Me too. The first one is hilarious.
I always laugh at the ridiculous face Ben Stiller makes.
Me too. Will Ferrel is great in that movie as well.
