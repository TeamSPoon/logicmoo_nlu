Who are some of your more underrated musicians right now?
Tinashe! Also, SZA and Kehlani.
I love Tinashe.
Who are you telling?
Her newest song is still as fresh as the first day I heard it.
Are you talking about "Flame"?
Yes, where she's like "Tell me that you still got the flame for me".
"And we can let it burn!"
It's SO good. Like, I can't believe more people aren't in love with it.
I agree. It kills me that she doesn't get more recognition.
She deserves to be winning Grammy's and having her songs on the radio.
She makes too good of music to be shunned like this.
I know. Her debut album was great, it's all great. I don't get it.
Aquarius! Yes, it was outstanding. All Hands on Deck, Wildfire, Bet on It... the list goes on.
Every song she makes is good to great.
True. I really can't think of a bad one she's ever had.
Even her videos are great. And she can dance! She can dance!
She can dance and sing. At the same time without skipping a beat.
I just don't get it, but some things I never will. Hopefully it will happen some day.
Yeah, I can hope.
