Did you ever watched Prisoners?
Yes, I seen it the day it came out.
It was one of those movies that made your skin crawl.
I agree! I came out of the movies feeling like I needed a shower.
There were a few twist that I didn't see coming.
Me too. I thought Jake and Hugh did amazing work.
Yes, there back and forth made the movie.
The premise was dark though even more if you have kids.
Yes, I probably would have done what Huge did in the movie.
I think most people would if pushed.
