Hey babe lets do a movie marathon tonight with some martial arts movies
Seriously again?
Yes you know I love all of those cheesy Karate Movies
Alright as long as we don't have to watch Karate Kid 1 2 and 3
Ha no we don't need to watch those.
What ones were you thinking about?
Well Out for Justice with Stephen Segal to start
Thats a good one
Then Hard to Kill also with Segal
Okay, can we do a Van Damme movie as well?
Sure how about Bloodsport or Kickboxer?
I was thinking Bloodsport I love when they fight in the Kumate
Okay then after Bloodsport lets do a great Chinese flick "Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon"
I don't think i've seen that one
Its probably one of the best foreign films you will love it
sounds good to me, do you want me to go pick up some popcorn at the store
Yes, and a six pack of beer
What kind?
Probably a good Belgium White beer
Blue Moon?  close enough?
