Hey, fellow nerd. Do you prefer Marvel or DC Comics for their movies?
Hey, fellow nerd. I prefer Marvel strongly.
Why is that?
Other than them being factually better based on reviews, overall they are more fun and well-made.
What about the villains?
What about them? What do you mean?
Well, in the MCU, the villains are after-thoughts. Look at the dark elves in Thor 2, any villain in Guardians of the Galaxy, even Ultron. They all lose somewhat easily.
Yeah, that's a good point. But the DC movies are all too heavily edited.
True, the director and producers are far too heavy-handed in it and make it into a massive mess.
Marvel also is far too silly. Did you see Guardians 2?
Yeah, it was fun, but far too silly, I see what you mean.
I get the characters are how they are supposed to be, but it's so comical it's unrealistic at that point.
There's lots of stuff that they'll have to address in the MCU, too.
Like?
Well, Peter Quill saw the universe, and everything. He may have lost his god powers, but he didn't lose his memory.
Think he'll use that to defeat Thanos?
I don't know; maybe he'll be a "bad guy" for a bit, or tease it.
Did they ever put him and Gamorrah together? Or just hint at the sexual tension?
I have no idea. Speaking of not knowing anything, we now see TONS of species of aliens in MCU thanks to Guardians, yet none of these worlds have been addressed on Earth.
Yeah, didn't Thor claim just 9 realms? This movie had like 20 types of people...
