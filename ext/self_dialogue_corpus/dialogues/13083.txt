I wish "Rogue One" was more Jedi stuff in it.
What do you mean?
Well, it just felt different than the other Star Wars movies to me. It was more battle stuff and not enough Jedi.
Yeah, but it made sense for the overall plot that it played out like it did. It was about regular people doing what needed to be done.
Yeah, I guess you're right. I did like that aspect of it though. The rebels being just soldiers, doing their duty, at all costs, to get the plans to the Death Star.
It would have been a totally different movie if it had been Obi Wan and Yoda and all the other Jedi in that battle.
True. The ultimate sacrifice of Jynn, Cassian, K2-SO and the rest of the rebel group made the victory that much richer.
But don't worry, you'll get your Jedi fix soon. The next movie is called "The Last Jedi" after all!
Woohoo! I can't wait. Want to go see it together?
I wouldn't miss it!
