Are you a big fan of Elton John?
I like a lot of his songs, but I'm not a superfan.
What are a couple of your favorite songs?
I really like Benny and the Jets.
Oh, yeah?  I always thought that was a dumb song.
No way!  You have to sing it with all your friends at the top of your lungs!
Seriously?
Yeah!  Get it to play at a bar or something and it's a load of fun, just screaming the words.
I don't think I even know the words, just Benny and the Jets.
That's pretty much what everyone knows.  Trust me, get it to play at a party.
I'll take your word for it.
Oh, you are missing out.
Have you ever been to any of his concerts?
Elton John?  No.
Oh, I've heard he is awesome.
I'm sure he is.  A friend of mine actually did security at one of the venues he played at.
What did he say?
He said that the dude has like a trailer just for his glasses!
Are you serious?
Well, that's what he told me.
