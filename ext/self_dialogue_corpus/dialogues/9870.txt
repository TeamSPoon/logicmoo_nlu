Which rapper has the most creative lyrics?
It's got to be Eminem.  Some of the stuff he comes up with is insane!
I don't know.  Insane might be the right word because the dude is nuts.
Very true. But who else can say stuff like, "my noodle is cockadoodledoo, my clocks cuckoo, I got screws loose, yeah the whole kit and caboodle" and get away with it?
It's true. He can seem to get away with some funny stuff that wouldn't work for other rappers.
Maybe it's his slim shady persona that makes it work.
By the way, what album are those lyrics from?
The 8 mile soundtrack.  It's one of his best.
That's right. The movie was good too.
I agree. It was better than I expected it to be.
