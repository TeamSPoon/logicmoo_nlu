Did you hear that Chris Cornell died?
Yeah, I heard. I don't really know much about him or his music though.
Oh my God. How do you know know about Chris Cornell? He is only one of the best rock musicians of our generation.
What was so great about him?
He was only one of the architects of the grunge movement. Maybe you remember that song from when we were younger called "Blackhole Sun?"
That song was everywhere! That was him? I didn't know that. I love that song.
Yeah, that was the band that he was in called Soundgarden. And do you remember the song "Cochise?"
You mean the one with all the mechanical gear songs building to that awesome creshendo of heavy hitting rock? I love that beat. I really rocked out to that!
Yeah, that was him, too. The man was a genius.
What group was that? Was that Soundgarden?
No, that was his more recent group, Audioslave.
What other hits did they have?
That song "Show me how to Live" was also theirs.
Oh, I liked that one too.
You know, he wasn't just in bands. He was also a pretty prolific solo artist. He recorded a theme for a James Bond movie called "You Know my Name"
That was the theme of Casino Royale, right?
Yeah. Good movie, even better soundtrack.
Wow, I guess I like Cornell's music more than I thought. I'm going to have to go back and listen to some more of his stuff.
Yeah. I've been immersing myself in his music lately. It is so sad that there won't be any more hits from such a great artist. The man will always be a legend in the world of rock.
Yeah, but at least we have such a large bank of his hits to enjoy. That powerhouse voice will live on forever.
