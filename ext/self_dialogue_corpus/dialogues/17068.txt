Did you ever listen to Guns N' Roses
Not really. I wasn't into hair bands.
Well they really weren't a hair band
What are you talking about? They're the definition of a hair band
I don't think so.
Did they have long hair back in the day?
Yeah.
Did they sing a lot of hard rock with guitar and drum solos?
Yes
Did they ever produce a love ballad?
Yes.
Well then they fit the hair band description to a "T"
I see your point.
Thank you for your recognition.
Did you like any of their work?
I was kind of into Use Your Illusion I and II
Oh yeah, didn't T2 have some of their songs in their soundtrack?
Yes. You Could Be Mine.
Ah right. Good song.
Yeah, it was pretty good for its time.
