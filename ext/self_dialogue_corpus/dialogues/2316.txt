I cannot wait for preseaon football to start!
It will be here in less than a month.
I know, who do you like this year?
You know me, I am a Patriot's fan all the way.
Ok besides them then.
I think the Titans have a lot of new talent, should be interesting to watch.
I think so too, I have been by some of the open practices, and it looks like they have a lot of great chemistery.
How important is that really to the game?
I think it is very important, as important as skills.
What part of the team intrigues you?
For the Titans, it would be their offense.
Why the offense?
Last season, their defense was virtually impregnatable, but the offense could never seem to connect.
That is true, their quarterback always seems to lose his arm mid third quarter.
I agree, and with the new running back, I think his energy is going to inspire the whole team to work harder.
Titans have not historically had a strong ground game.
Exactly, Fisher was all about the air game, like he had a few picks that were the entire show.
That is no way to run a team.
I think their chances are good this year of at least a playoff.
I do too.
