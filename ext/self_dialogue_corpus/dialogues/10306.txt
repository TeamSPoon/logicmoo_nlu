Did you watch guardians of the galaxy Vol 2?
Yeah I did. loved it.
Me too. I think it captured a bunch of essense of the first one.
Yeah all the lovable characters were back and they didn't lose a step.
I also like how they can be good guys, but still act bad.
yeah the good guy bad guy aspect makes it way better than most movies like it.
What did you think about StarLords dad?
I thought that made the story very cool.
Yeah knowing he is partially a god made me happy.
Yeah i loved the little groot! was super cute!
