Have you heard of any good movies coming up?
Not any that have really caught my eye.
I saw a commercial for a new Diary of a Wimpy Kid.
Oh I liked the first two.
Yes, they were cute and funny. Something good for the whole family.
I agree. The books were good too.
I don't think they have the same actors, though.
I doubt they do. They must all be grown.
That's the problem with sequels. If they are too far apart the actors out grow the parts.
It makes it difficult to follow with different actors.
This is the type of movie, though that it really doesn't matter.
I guess you're right. The characters will still be the same.
I think I might take my daughter to see it over the weekend.
I am sure she will like it.
I kind of want to see the Captain Underpants one too.
What? They made one of those?
Yes, where have you been?
I know, I'm too busy to pay attention to this stuff.
Maybe well see a double feature.
That would be fun!
