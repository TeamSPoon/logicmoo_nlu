Do you like Sleeping Beauty?
Yes, I was always very afraid of Maleficent, though.
She is the scariest villain in any Disney movie, especially when she turned into a dragon.
Plus, she cursed an innocent little baby for no real reason!
That was terrible. It's a good thing Aurora survived.
I loved how Flora, Fauna, and Merryweather bickered over her dress color.
That was a cute part. They cared about her in their own goofy way!
What was your favorite scene?
I like the "Once Upon a Dream" song, so I like the scene when it plays.
That is a good song! One of my favorite Disney songs.
