Do you want to go see Rush with me?
Rush?! I didn't know they were still touring.
Yeah, they're doing a 15 city run this summer.
Yeah, totally, I'd love to go.
Okay, cool. It should be a really good time.
Yeah, for sure. How'd you find out about the show?
I've been poking around online and trying to find all the older bands I listen to.
Like which ones?
Well, Rush, for one.
Yeah, I gathered that.
I also looked up Iron Maiden, The Who, The Pixies, and a few more.
That's pretty cool, are all of them touring this summer.
Yeah, they are.
Are you trying to go to all of those shows.
Yup, I have been working lots of overtime to save money.
I knew you loved concerts, but I didn't realize it was this intense.
Well, I haven't always been this enthusiastic about making sure I go to concerts.
What changed?
Well, after all those celebrities and musicians died last year, I decided that if I want to see someone live, I need to just do it. No more waiting arou
Wow, that's actually a really good idea!
