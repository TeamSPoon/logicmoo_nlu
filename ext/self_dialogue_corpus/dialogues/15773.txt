Do you have Spotify?
Yes, I just downloaded it. Do you have it too?
Of course! Are you following any playlists?
Yeah, I've been really into hip hop lately, so I've been listening to Rap Caviar on my workouts.
Nice - I'm a fan of that playlist too! Do you have a favorite hip hop artist?
I like Drake a lot, and 2Chainz, and of course, Kendrick Lamar. You?
Drake and Kendrick Lamar are great! Do you like 90s hip hop?
90s hip hop is one of my favorite genres! I love older stuff from Snoop Dogg and Cypress Hill.
Oh me too! And Biggie, naturally.
West coast rap is the best! What's your favorite Biggie song?
Hmm, that's a tough question, but Hypnotize is always a classic.
Ah yes, I love that one! It's really good for dancing,
I agree. So who else do you listen to from the 90s?
Well of course, Cypress Hill's 'Insane in the Brain' is great. How do you feel about Wu-Tang?
I love Wu-Tang! Enter the Wu-Tang might be the greatest hip hop record of the 90s!
"Cash rules everything around me!" Yeah, I love that record too!
"C.R.E.A.M." is great! One of Wu Tang's best.
I totally agree. What's your favorite Snoop Dogg song?
Oh, definitely "Gin and Juice."
That one's great! Man hip hop was really amazing back in the 90s.
