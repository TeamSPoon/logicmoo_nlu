Did you know that Darth Plagueis The Wise was actually still alive during the Phantom Menace era?
No I actually did not know that. I know that he was the one who trained Sidious.
Yeah, actually he did discover Sidious back on Naboo, and had been lurking in the shadows ever since. His original plan was to co-rule from the shadows with Palpatine as Chancellor.
I guess we know how that turned out!
Yeah, the Sith's plans never seem to actually go as planned. Sidious ended up killing him in his sleep.
Speaking of, I was really sad that Darth Maul got killed off in The Phantom Menace.
He really was the best bad guy of that whole series of movies. It's depressing that he went out like that.
I would have preferred him over General Grievous any day. Talk about a way better villian!
I didn't like how they kept introducing villains and then just killing them off in the same movie. Have some continuity.
Yeah. These one off bad guys are lame. I need consistency in my villains!
