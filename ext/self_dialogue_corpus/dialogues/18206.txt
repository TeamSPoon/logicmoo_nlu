Did you hear the song called "Let it Go?"
Yes, my daughter sang that all the time.
Mine too.
It's a beautiful song you have to admit.
I know.  The Disney songs are charmers.
Any Disney music is incredible.
I went to Disney this year and experienced it live.
That is amazing!
I know.  It's an incredible place.
They have so much musical talent there.
They have musicians on Main Street and throughout the park.
Yep.
That would be a dream job.
What other Disney songs do you like?
I love the track from Aladdin.
The music is inspiring and hopeful.
That is one thing about Disney music.  It does make you dream and fantasize.
They really know how to find the best musicians.
The composers and orchestras that play Disney's music are incredible.
I hope to go there to experience the live music soon.
