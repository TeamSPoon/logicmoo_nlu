I'm so excited for the Despicable Me 3 movie to come out!
Me too!
I can watch the minions all day every day, they're so hilarious.
Me too!
I don't know why people hate them so much.
Me neither!
Are you patronizing me?
No, but I can see why it comes off like that. I actually agree with you.
What did you think of their solo movie?
The time frame doesn't work out, but it's cute and fun.
Time frame?
Well, when they left the north pole, they kind of took 500 years or so to get to New York.
I never thought of that. But yeah, that took a while.
How do they go to the bathroom?
I don't know. For all the bananas they eat, it's crazy.
Maybe they naturally burn everything off. They can survive in space, so they can do other things.
What an odd evolution: they evolved into males only so there's no reproduction.
Good thing. Can you imagine them taking over the earth or procreating?
We'd be overrun.
At least we can shoot them into space and they'd survive!
