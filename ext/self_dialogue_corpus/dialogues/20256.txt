What was the last movie you seen?
We watched The Founder on Friday.
What was that about?
It was about the founder of McDonald's.
Oh that sounds good. Who was the founder?
Two McDonald's brothers were taken over by a salesman who started the biggest franchise ever.
Wow. How much did the brothers get for selling?
Only 1 million dollars each. If they got a royality they wanted, it would have been 100 million per year!
Gosh that's a lot of money.
Yes. Micheal Keaton is the star, he's a great actor.
I bet it made you hungry.
It sure did. Have you seen any good movies?
I seen Once Upon a Time in Venice.
Oh, who is in that?
Bruce Willis and Jason Momoa, my khal.
What's it about?
A stolen car, drug deal gone wrong, a kidnapped dog.
Oh I have to see it, sounds good.
It was action packed and full of laughs. Even Bruce Willis naked.
How funny! Not a frontal I hope.
