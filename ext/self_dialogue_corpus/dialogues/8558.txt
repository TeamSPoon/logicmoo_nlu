The Dave Clark Five was one of my favorite bands.
I liked the Beatles better.
Did you know their song Glad All Over knocked off I Want to Hold Your Hand in the UK?
Really.  What was the name of their movie?
Catch Us if You Can, or Having a Wild Weekend in the USA.
Not as big hit as A Hard Day's Night.
Not at all.
What was their last big US hit?
You've Got What It Takes, 1967.
They pretty vanished after that.
