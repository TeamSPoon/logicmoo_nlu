What do you think of the Rams' move to LA?
I don't like it.
Why?
It's a stupid money grab.
Why? They used to be there!
Exactly! And went back to St. Louis!
So you don't think the Rams should be in LA?
I don't think ANY team should be in LA.
Why not?
It's not a football town. What happens to every team that goes there?
They leave.
Exactly! LA just doesn't care.
Then why keep trying?
It's the second-biggest market in the country.
Ah. True.
And owners think people in LA will pay more than in St. Louis.
They have a point.
They don't care about fans. You know who's gonna pay for that stadium?
The fans?
The entire city.
