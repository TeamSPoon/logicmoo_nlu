Do you ever listen to instrumental music?
All the time!
In what context.
Well lots of times words distract me. Instrumental music is perfect for doing homework.
Yeah that makes sense. I can't have lyrics when I read, but then again I read in silence.
I always have music when I read.
What kind of music do you listen to when you do homework or read?
Either classical or electronic.
Electronic is usually too exciting for me to do homework too.
Actually I listen to really chill songs. They're repetitive and mellow.
Oh really. Does that exist?
Yeah it's a whole genre. It's called Chill, Chill out, or Chillstep.
Wow I didn't realize, I should check it out.
I also listen to instrumental music like classical piano, or also orchestral arrangements.
That sounds pretty good. Any particular groups you recommend?
The Piano guys, various symphonies. Try Pandora.
What's Pandora for?
Basically it's an internet radio that tries to fine tune to what you like.
Oh that's pretty good I'll check it out.
Let me know how it goes.
