Really?  I can't wait to see it . It looks interesting.
Yes, Tom Cruise always does a great job in his movies.
Yes, they are not boring, and movie fast.
When is it supposed to come out?
I think it comes out June 9th in theaters nationwide.
Cool, I will make note of it.
What movie did you see last?
It was Beauty and the Beast (laughing)!
Ah!  It looked cute, I saw that one too.
What did you think?
I thought it was more for kids, but it was relaxing and the movie was well done by Disney as usual.
Yes , Emma Watson does a nice job, it was great for kids.
They did a nice job with the soundtrack of the movie too.
They sure did. So much singing in the movie, it surprised me how well Emma sings.
Yes, she is a well rounded actor.
Well, I have to go soon to work.
Ok, maybe we can go to the movies together some night soon.
Sure, give me a call!
