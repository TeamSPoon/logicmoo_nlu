I just heard the best news. There's going to be a sequel to Unbreakable.
That movie wtih Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson?
Yeah, the one where Bruce Willis can't get hurt, but Samuel L. Jackson gets hurt by everything.
That was a really good movie, it was when M. Night Shyamalan still made good films.
I don't know. I really like most of his films.
Even Lady in the Water?
Especially Lady in the Water. It's a modern fairytale with Paul Giamatti, it's amazing.
What about The Happening, no one liked that movie.
I did. I thought it was an interested premise.
Plants turning on humans?
Why not?
What about the casting in that movie. I mean Marky Mark and Zooey Deschanel?
Mark Wahlberg isn't the best actor, but I think he did Ok. Zooey Deschanel did really well I thought.
She was kind of awful. Texting that other guy and she didn't like kids.
But that's realisitic, she was a woman going through some things even as the world fell down around her.
I guess. I did really like Unbreakable and Sixth Sense, even The Village was pretty good.
Did you see The Visit? It was so scary!
It was a bit predictable, but yeah it was freaky scary!
So this sequel, Glass, comes out in 2019, I think we should go see it.
As long as he doesn't cast Marky Mark.
