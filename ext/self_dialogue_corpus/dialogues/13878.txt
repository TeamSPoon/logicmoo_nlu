Hey, you know what I haven't heard much about lately? Lady Gaga.
Oh yeah? I mean, I guess I was still in middle school when she was really popular.
Did you ever listen to her non-pop-music stuff?
No, I didn't have internet back then.
Really? That's strange. But yeah, she sang with Tony Bennett once!
That old guy? That's awesome! What's the name of the song?
They did "The Lady is a Tramp" together. It was really cute.
I like her voice well enough, but I'm just not that into new-disco.
Definitely check out The Lady is a Tramp with them, then. She sounds like a lounge singer!
Sweet! I'll look up her newer stuff when I get home.
