Do you like the Chicago Bears?
They aren't the worst team.
Who is your favorite player on their roster?
Kendall Wright has some promise.
His stats haven't been to great the past two seasons.
He is really fast though.
I'm sure he could surprise anyone and have a good season.
Part of it is luck.
You think he has been unlucky so far?
Yeah exactly what I think.
What do you think he needs to do to improve?
Well beyond putting more work in the offseason he should not overthink his stats.
Yeah overthinking anything never ends well.
If he can just tune out all the noise and focus on the game he has a chance to be great.
I would love to see him have a great season.
Also seeing the Bears have a great season would be nice.
Yeah just making the playoffs would be great.
They haven't made an appearance since 2010.
They definitely want to end that drought.
I agree it would be nice for them to make the playoffs this season.
