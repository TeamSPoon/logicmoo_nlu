he harry how was your day?
oyeah today was ok, just got back in from work,you?
am on the bus heading home, by the way what's the name of the lead actor on "wolverine"?
that should be Hugh Jackman
yeah yeah jackman, i just saw  him on a bill board  for a new movie but couldn't get the name of the movie before the bus drove passed, any idea of his recent work, i love him on the "wolverine"
yeah jackman is a great actor and i guess you must be talking about "Logan" that is the latest movie is on now and i have seen it already with Ann and cineworld just this past weekend.
oh really and you never say mate lol
oh well wanted to do it as a couple reason why i never told you.
oh well understandable, so how was the movie, worth it?
mate its worth every bit is about a story of a homeless man (jackman) acting as a guardian angel for a very rich professor who never treat hugh (jackman) nicely.
hmm that sound like so intriguing movie
it is don't let me spoil the fun by narrating it,i think you should rather see it.
i would do that was why i wanted his name so i could goggle the name of the movie, never knew you've watched it yourself.
yh i have, i think its playing this weekend as well at cineworld.
cineworld is rather too far for me,i would check when its playing at Odeon.
oh that's true Odeon is just a few bus stop from you.
yeah would check at Odeon but if its not playing this weekend then i would do cineworld and pay you guys a visit afterward.
oh that would be great still,just let me know if it happens you'd do cineworld
definitely would, anyways almost close to my bus stop, would speak to you later.
alright mate, talk later.
