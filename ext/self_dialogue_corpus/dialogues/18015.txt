Do you like classical music
I do like some of it
which artists do you prefer
Bach is one of my favorites
who else do you like
I also like Handel
what is your favorite Handel piece
I would have to say the classic Halleluah
Yes that is a classic a great one
I also like Mozart of course
All of the classic composers would be in a top 10 list
yes they most definately could
Then you have Beethoven
another classic composer
what is your favorite Beethoven piece
I will always have to go with the 5th symphone
I suppose you can't go wrong with that and everybody knows that one
Brahms is also great
Yes symphony #3 is the best
It is up there with the best anyway.
