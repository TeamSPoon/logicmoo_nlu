Do you remember who won the Super Bowl after the 1972 Dolphins?
Yes, the Dolphins.
Oh, so they won back-to-back?
Yes, that is correct.
Who did they beat in their second Super Bowl?
The Minnesota Vikings
Oh the Vikings. I don't think they've won a Super Bowl before
That's right. Been a bunch of times, but never won one.
Like the Bills.
Kind of, but the Bills went four times in a row and lost each time.
Yeah, that was brutal.
Do you remember the Vikings QB back then?
No
Fran Tarkenton.
Oh yeah, he's beloved up there.
And in Georgia. He's a Bulldog
Yeah, the great #10.
Yes, that's him.
Well the Dolphins were probably the dominant team back then
Yes, that is correct.
