Hey, who's that playing on the radio?
That's The Tom Thumb band
Never heard of them.  They're pretty good.
Yeah, they really swing.  They were around in the mid 30's
Some of that Big Band sound.  Maybe I've heard them after all and didn't know it.
It's that way with a lot of the bands from back then.  A lot of them sound the same at times
I like Jazz and Swing but the names of the bands and songs just don't stick with me.
Some of the old greats is easy for me to pick out but there's a lot that I don't know either.
Do you go see any jazz here in town?
Oh, yeah.  I've seen some good local bands like the Milk Toast orchestra and Franky and the Hoot Owls.
I've seen Franky before.  He was with the Bluecoat's though.  Haven't seen Milk Toast though.
Oh, their great.  They are playing next Saturday at the Pole Hole.  Wanna go?
Really, yeah.  That would be great.  I haven't seen any live music in a while.
Excellent.  I'll pick up four tickets and you can buy dinner.  Sound good.
Ok, that sounds good.  The Pole Hole's got good food to go with the good music.
Great.  The last time I saw Milk Toast was there and they played three sets.  We stayed for all three.
Did you dance?
Of course, you can't go listen to Milk Toast without getting happy feet.
Well, Cindy loves to dance so that will be perfect.
Here let me lend you their latest CD so you can play it for Cindy before we go see them.
