Is it just me or are all the classic QB's in the NFL getting old?
You mean like Eli manning, Aaron Rodgers, and Tom BRady, those types of guys?
Exactly.  It seems like those guys are living legends who are all towards the end of their careers
Yeah to some degree I agree with that, but there are younger players that will eventually be just like those classic players for Example Russell WIlson
Is it just me or are the costs to attend NFL games like rediculous ?
its crazy, between tickets, parking, food and drinks you can spend a small fortune just for a couple of hours
Its surprising that its like that given that the fan experience from home keeps improving
Right I would rather spend $500 on my theater system at home to permantenlty keep than blow it on one game
I enjoy watching the classic NFL cities the best, the ones that actually get snow
yeah like Chicago Bears, Cleveland Browns, Pittsburgh Steelers....
Exactly.  Have you been to any of those stadiums?
Yes I went to a game at Soldier Field in Chicago, and I have to say it was pretty amazing.
NFL is by far my favorite of the major sports because every game is very meaningful
I totally agree, baseball for example is way too long.  you don't need to watch every game
Do you know anyone who still collects football cards
No I don't, i think thats a thing of the past but it sure was cool back in the day.
Do you think the NFL is the best right now that its ever been?
I honestly do.   There are so many living legends playing right now and the Superbowl is bigger and better than ever
last question, who is your favorite team?
THe Cleveland Browns, go Browns baby!!!!! whoooo hooooo
