hey, so what happened about our movie fan club?
yes, I couldn't get it started this week, but next week I am sure I'll get it done.
okay so are we going to focus on one particular genre or it is a generalized fan club?
I haven't given it that much thought yet. But I am thinking of making it limited to a particular genre.
oh okay, I am cool with that. So what genre you have in your mind?
I think I am going to go with sci fi.
That sounds cool. I myself am a huge fan of sci fi movies.
really? I didn't know that. So which is your favorite sci fi movie?
I think martian is one of my favorite sci fi movie.
oh wow! what a co incidence. That's my favorite sci fi movie as well!
I just love that movie. It's like having glimpse at future.
yes, and the future that doesn't seem very distant.
yes, it definitely looks possible in next 50 years.
so did you like matt damon's acting in martian?
oh yes, I think he was the perfect actor to play that role.
yes, somehow I feel that matt damon does pretty great job in space movies.
oh yes, I just remember that he was in interstellar as well.
yes, but I didn't like that they took him as a bad guy in interstellar.
yes, I was portrayed as a bit stupid in interstellar,
exactly. You won't believe that I was going to say the exact same thing!
