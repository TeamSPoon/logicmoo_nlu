How about dem Browns?
what about them, they are always terrible anymore
Yeah, but it is like spring training.
sure, no losing record yet at least.
Dude,they are getting better
really, they say that ever year, and the pftttt
Look they have like a zillion new draft picks , high one.
They don't have a quarterback still.
they have a couple guys who could be OK
They have a couple rookies and a veteran, just like last year.
The Browns didn't waste any time getting guys who got hyped up like the last two years at least.
Yeah, If I ever hear anybody say "Johnny Football" I'll punch em.
I know, that's to funny like nobody could see how that was going to play out.
Nobody wants to play here.
I don't know, this coaching staff  is getting me a little more confident.
But nobody gets to stay more than a couple years, they can never even get their program of the ground before they are fired.
I think they learned that lesson finnaly, a couple of those coaches were victims of stupid front office and owner moves.
That owner is an idiot.
He probably is, but he seems to have backed off telling the football guys what to do.
Maybe, he must get embarrassed owning a team that literally everybody else points to as a way not to do things.
