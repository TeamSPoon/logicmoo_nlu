Wild Hearts Can't Be Broken was such a good movie
It was, she had this dream and it came true
but at a price, she lost her sight
I know the impact from diving, that was sad
diving horses was a real thing , that is what I heard
I also heard that , I used to imagine I was a horse diver
I bet it was hard on the horses though
I do not think PETA would like that now
now that I think of it, I bet that was animal abuse in some way
yes, and dangerous to people as well/
