What Disney movie are you looking forward to?
Big Hero 7
Really? They're making a sequel to Big Hero 6. That would be awesome
Yeah, apparantly they don't have a definitive release date yet though.
Bummer, guess something I will have to keep an eye out for. Any idea of the details?
I read that Tadashi apparantly makes a miraculous comeback as a villan
That's absurd! First off he is dead, and secondly he's the creator of Beymax, who was designed to help people.
I'm not sure, although didn't Tadashi's brother, Hiro have a stent in the first movie where he became a bit of a villan himself?
Well sort of, it was more "vigilante justice" but not "villan" as in harming innocent people.
Sometimes they are classified one in the same, not sure how Tadashi will be classified in this.
