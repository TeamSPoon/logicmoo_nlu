What is your favorite James Cameron movie.
I'd have to think about it.  What is yours?
I really like Terminator 2.
That's a really good one.
So what is your favorite.
I would say Avatar.
That movie is really cool.
I like the cgi in it.
Did you know that James Cameron wanted to make Avatar in 1999?
No, why didn't he?
It would of had to have a budget of $400 million dollars.
Dang that is expensive.
James Cameron also didn't think the cgi then was ready for the movie.
What made him change his mind?
James Cameron saw Gollum in Lord of the Rings and knew cgi could do Avatar now.
That's crazy that Lord of the Rings is responsible for Avatar.
They are two different worlds.
Yeah, one is blue aliens that are 8 feet tall and the other has hobbits.
I thought the Na'vi aliens in Avatar would cool looking.
The were a little freaky but overall cool.
