Are you going to the U2 concert in June?
No.  Are you going?
Yep.  It is the 30th Anniversary of the Joshua Tree album.
I can't believe it's been that long.
U2 has been around for a while.  They are still producing good music.
Really?  I think there last few albums were not enjoyable for me..
I can find something to enjoy on just about every U2 album released.
The albums that they have released since the year 2000 have been lackluster.
You didn't like the album "All that you can't leave behind"?  That was a return to their roots.
I will admit.  I think that is a fairly decent album.
"How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb" had some great songs.  City of Blinding Lights is one of my favorite U2 songs now.
I didn't like that album.  It felt too commercial and polished for me.
What would be your favorite U2 album?
My favorite album is probably "War".
That was when they were young and edgy.
Yes.  I think that is why those songs are some of my favorites.
They are some gems from that time period that no one talks about.  Such as "Seconds".
That is a great song!
If I can get a ticket for you, would you want to come to U2 concert in June?
Maybe.  I will have to think about it.
