Have you heard about the new Saw movie coming out?
I did hear they are making another one.
I heard Jigsaw will be in this one.
Oh, I had not heard who was in it.
I am not sure why they they killed him off just to have him be in them.
I don't know why they would go through all the trouble of that.
I hope it is not silly. Sometimes the sequels get stupid.
I agree. But these movies seem to keep the attraction of the orginal.
Let's hope this one does as well. I know I will see it.
Me too!
