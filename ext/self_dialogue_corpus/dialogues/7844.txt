Have you seen Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone?
Yeah! I love that movie.
I think it's the best of all the movies. Happie Birthday Harry Potter
Yer a wizard Harry!
And the way Hermione is such a bossy intelligent young women at such a young age.
Those kids were really good actors!
I love Malfoy to be entirely honest
Are you serious? He's a brat
I guess you're right. McGonnagal would be the best teacher. I wish I had her
Oh me too! Imagine a teacher that can turn into a cat!
