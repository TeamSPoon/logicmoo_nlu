What do you think about the stereotype for country music?
I think its a little ridiculous honestly.
Are you a country fan?
Yes I am, and I am a country girl so I love the music. I can relate to it.
Is it true that if you play country backwards, your dog and wife come back?
That is a funny joke honestly, but who knows!
I can say that I am not a huge fan of the stereotype either.
Yes, it is not all redneck drunks that listen to country.
I think I once heard that the country music genre has the most bass of any genre.
I have heard that too, but I doubt it is true.
Yeah, seems a little far fetched.
So do you prefer old country or these new country genres?
I like the older stuff, I think then newer stuff sounds too much like pop music.
That we agree on, I do no listen to much of the new stuff at all.
I like stuff like Tim Mcgraw, Allan Jackson, old Kenny Chesney, etc.
Yes! The good old music was the best.
Those artists still make music, but I do not like it much.
I like a couple of newer songs that Kenny Chesney has done.
Yes same here, but not very many.
Tim Mcgraw is still making hits though.
