Are you into really weird movies?
Yeah, why do you ask?
Well, I just saw one that was the weirdest I've ever seen.
What is the name of it?
It's called Naked Lunch, ever seen it?
No I haven't, What is it about?
It is about an exterminator in the 1950's who starts injecting bug spray.
Wow that sounds pretty nasty.
It is, and it gets even weirder.
What happens to him after he injects bug spray?
He basically starts having really vivid hallucinations.
What kind of hallucinations?
At first, he sees giant cockroaches, and typewriters turning into cockroaches.
Wow that's pretty freaky.
Yeah, and it gets even weirder.
What happens later in the movie?
Well, he meets an alien in a bar.
Haha, wow this is the weirdest movie I have heard of.
Yeah, he just pretty much loses his mind.
It sounds like it, I will have to check it out.
