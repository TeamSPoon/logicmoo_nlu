Who do you think is the best team in baseball?
The Astros.
Really?  What about the Yankees?
The Astros beat them 3 out of 4 last weekend.  They were dominant.
Yea, they are pretty good.  What is their weakness?
They are more than pretty good, they are very good.  I think they probably need one more quality staring pitcher.
Do you think they will get one?
I think they will make a trade for one by the trade deadline.
When is that?
The deadline is mid-July.
Do you think they will make it to the World Series?
For sure.  They have the best record right now and are very good.
How many games do you think they will win.
I would say 97 or 98.
You don't think the Rangers can catch them?
The Rangers are ok, but they have their own problems.
The Rangers beat them bad last year in their series.
This is a different Astros team.  A better blend of young stars and seasoned veterans.
I hope you are right.  Who do you think they will play in the World Series?
I think the Cubs will bounce back after their slow start.  It could be an interesting Cubs-Astros series.
