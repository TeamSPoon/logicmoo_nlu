Have you seen the movie The Wedding Singer?
Yes, I loved it! Adam Sandler did a really good job.
Yes he did, I also liked Drew Barrymore in that movie.
She did a good job, better than in 50 First Dates.
Yes, I wasn't a huge fan of that movie. I did like Adam Sandler in Mr. Deeds.
He was pretty funny in that movie. His character kind of reminded me of his character in Happy Gilmore.
Oh yes, that's the movie where he is a hockey player and enters a golf tournament right?
Yes, his being really strong is what reminds me of his character in Mr. Deeds.
Oh you're right. That's also true in the movie Waterboy.
Yes it is! That's one of my favorite Adam Sandler movies.
