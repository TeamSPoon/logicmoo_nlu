Yea, both of those teams will probably still be contenders, but maybe other teams will rise.
Yea, how about the Chiefs in the AFC?
I'm not sure what to think about them honestly.
Yea, they seem like they may be one of those teams built to win in the regular season.
Yea, Reid has had some playoff success in the past, but never brought superbowls.
Yea and it seems similar in Kansas City.
They keep fielding great teams, but not winning when it matters most.
Yea and now apparently they feel like they are better off without Jeremy Maclin.
Yea, well they have a balanced attack anyway. Alex Smith isn't gonna win any throwing competitions.
You're right, but the guy sure knows how to win games.
Yea, he is the epitome of what they call a game manager.
I agree! He makes good decisions, gets the ball out of his hands quickly, and finds his playmakers.
He, I think from the time he touches the ball to the time it leaves his hand, he averages the quickest release in the league.
With speedy guys like Tyreek Hill. That is a great quality to have.
Yea, just get him the ball in open space and you may go for six.
Yea, that guy really showed what he can do last year.
Yea, they do have some talent.
They have a couple of running backs that can play too.
Yea, neither are stars, but they work well together.
Yea, we will see if they have enough to get over the top this year.
