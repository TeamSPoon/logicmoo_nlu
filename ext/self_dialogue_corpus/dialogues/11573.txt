The Beatles are great.
Yeah, I agree.
I love all of their songs.
Every album is perfect.
I like all of their stuff. The early stuff and the late stuff.
They have a very unique sound too
Yes. There is no song like Hey Jude out there.
That song is so long and amazing.
I heard Bob Dylan influenced them.
He probably did. He was a great song writer.
