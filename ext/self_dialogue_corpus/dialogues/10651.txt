I want o have a family movie night this weekend
Oh great idea, what kind of movie?
I am not sure, I am thinking something fast paced and exciting
How about  fast and furious?
Oh yeah, I bet the kids would love that
The cars are really amazing, and I love Vin deisel
I loved Paul Walker, I was sad to hear he died
I agree, such a waste, he was a really good actor
Want to join us for movie night?
I would love that, thanks
