Did you watch The Santa Clause?
Yes I love Tim Allen movies.
I loved how close they made him look to Santa.
Yeah it was funny and odd to see him that big.
The effects they must have had to use.
I dont think it was effects, just alot of makeup.
Did you catch the sequel?
No I liked the original too much
I believe they even did a third one.
I think that is going a bit too far.
