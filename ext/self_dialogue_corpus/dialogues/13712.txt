Did you know that Lady Gaga went to  Convent of the Sacred Heart high school?
I did know that, my cousin was in her class. They have a great theater program!
I wonder if she ever did musicals while she was there?
She did actually, my cousin was in two of them with her.
Wow, that's crazy! Do you know which musicals?
I do, she was in Guys and Dolls and A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum.
I love Guys and Dolls. Its one of my favorite musicals.
Me too. I have seen it a bunch of times!
Does your cousin still keep in contact with Lady Gaga?
No, they weren't really close in high school. They just knew each other from theater.
