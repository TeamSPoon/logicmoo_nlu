Do you think Weezer is good?
They have been around for a long time
Yes I know that, which album is your  favorite?
I would say The Blue Album
Yeah that got them on the map.
I loved Undone
That was a great song with an awesome video.
Buddy Holly has a better video.
What about Pinkerton?
Only liked one song, El Scorcho.
And the Green Album?
I think that was flat
It was one of their lackluster albums
Have you ever seen them live?
No they seem like they'd be boring
They are very but the music is good
I dont understand their cult following
What is there to not understand?
Why so many people like them and they play boring tracks
I wouldnt say boring, just basic
