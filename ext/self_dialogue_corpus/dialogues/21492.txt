Hey did you ever see The Imitation Game?
You mean the one with Bernadett Cumberbunch?
Benedict Cumberbatch, silly!
Oh right, that's it! And Keira Knightley, right?
Yes, she was fantastic
No i haven't seen it. Isn't it about a mathmetician or something?
Yes, Cumberbatch plays Alan Turing, a british mathmetician who's now considered the father of computer science
Oh, right i remember that now
Yes, and he helped develop a machine that could decode the Nazi's encrypted communication.
Oh right, and that helped the allies win WWII
Exactly. He was instrumental in the outcome. Amazing.
Yes, very. I will have to check it out sometime.
Definitely. I forget who directed it, but it's well done.
Yeah, those are good actors for sure.
Yep, and there's a couple twists i of course won't tell you about
Please don't!
No worries. Keira Knightley is so beautiful.
She really is. I would watch the film just to see her.
True. But it's a good history lesson and entertaining otherwise too.
Yes. Win win!
