In your opinion, what is an underrated thriller film?
I think the movie 1408, based off the Stephen King short story is a good example.
I absolutely agree. That is actually one of my favorite scary movies!
It's a very simple, and yet interesting story following Michael's character.
I really enjoyed his overll struggle with the room and just how the room got to his inner emotions.
Exactly. Especially towards the end where the room has him vision his daughter dying in his arms.
That was definitely a "Wow!" moment to me. Very sad but also it captures how evil the room was.
Agreed. Do you think he truly escaped the room?
In the original version, yes he did. But there are multiple endings.
Oh, that's right. I prefer the ending where Michael survives!
