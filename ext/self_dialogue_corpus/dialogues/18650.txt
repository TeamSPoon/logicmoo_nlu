Do you like Go Radio?
I don't think I have heard any of their music.
Oh, have you ever heard of Mayday Parade?
I think I have heard a few of their songs.
Well, Jason Lancaster was in Mayday Parade. He left and was in a band called Go Radio.
Hmm, that happens all the time.
Yeah. He was my favorite member of the band so I was really happy when he started another one.
That's great! I am glad he didn't just fall of the face of the earth.
Unfortunately, Go Radio has already broken up.
Wow really? That sucks.
Yeah. I liked them a lot too.
I'm sorry. Is he doing anything else?
He started a solo career, but it isn't great.
Well maybe it will get better with time. Sounds like maybe he is hard to work with.
I agree. He went solo after disputes with two different bands!
Maybe their personalities just didn't work well together.
Maybe. I just want him to make good music again.
I will give some of his stuff a listen.
I can recommend some songs.
Sounds great! Just send them to me.
