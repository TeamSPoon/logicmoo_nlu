Who is your favorite NFL team?
I am a Denver Broncos fan.
Denver? Really?
Yes. I have been since John Elway was quarterback.
That was a long time ago.
I was probably 8 or 9 when I started following them.
I bet you were happy when they hired Payton Manning.
Not really I don't like the guy.
Who doesn't like Payton Manning?
Me apparently. I just think he is an amazing football player but he is a crappy person.
Really? Why do you think that?
Do you remember when he was out for the year from the Colts with neck surgery?
That was the same year his brother Eli won the superbowl right?
Yes. When his brother won it was a major accomplishment.
It was and I was glad to see he won.
So was the nation but instead of letting his brother bask in that glory and allowing him to celebrate his accomplishment, Payton made it all about him.
What do you mean?
Payton was in front of every camera he could find talking about his contract with the Colts. It took the spotlight away from Eli which was sad.
Isn't that just sibling rivalry?
Maybe but Denver capitalized on it an Payton fueled the fire so to say.
