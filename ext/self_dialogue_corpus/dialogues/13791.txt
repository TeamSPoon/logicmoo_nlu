Did you ever hear any of the cheek to cheek album?
I don't know it at all.
Oh, it is a collaboration between Gaga and Tony Bennet.
Really? That seems like an odd combo.
I supposoe but I really enjoyed it.
What songs are on the album?
It has mainly Jazz standards. the idea is they wanted to bring these songs to younger generations.
That is a pretty cool project. What songs exactly?
Well there are many, but The Lady is a Tramp, I Can't Give You Anything but Love, Anything goes.
I think that sounds cool. I will have to find this cheek to cheek album and give it a listen.
