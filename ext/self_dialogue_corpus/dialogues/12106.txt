So, yeah, I love Star Wars, but even I have to admit, George Lucas can't write romantic dialogue.
Oh, I know, the Padme and Anakin relationship just did NOT work at all.
Yeah but what do you expect from a sixty year old divorced millionaire?
Well, certainly something better than a guy comparing the woman he loves to sand.
Oh, man, what that was bad!  (dead voice) I don't like sand.... it's coarse... it's rough and it get into everything.
Personally, I just find the whole premise that have attachment to a woman is what turns him to the dark side.
Well, it's kind of a like a "Jedi's as monks" kind of thing.
I think you're giving it waaay too much credit.  I would have gone with the "ambition and uncontrollable anger even with the best of intentions" being Anakin's downfall.
Well, they did show he had a bit of a temper in the second film.
Yeah, by have him immediately start whining Padme within five minutes of them meeting each other again.
