You nkow what's really stupid?
Yes. i know many things that are stupid. Including you.
Shut up. You know what I mean.
No I don't. what do you mean?
I mean look at it, it's a subway train, why is it blowing up in flames like that? They're all electric.
Right, but,. but. if we don;t have the flames, the rnold fighting the Satan is much less dramatic. It IS about the End of Days after all.
ys, but they have to make it believable. Now it's just stupid and funny
Oh, I don't know flames and burning seems pretty entertaining. It's all in good whole some family fun,.
you know what else is stupid?
Ok, here we go again.
The Hollywood portrayal of Satan.
And what's wrong with it? I might regret asking this...
I'll tell you exactly what;'s wrong with it. hollywood portray Satan as this winged creature with horns, right?
That's the idea yes.
There is no religious text in Christendom, that supports that image. None. There are pagan supports for that, but not legit religion
And unless it's from a legit religion, the portrayal is... wrong?
Not wrong, but annoying. Look. Satan was supposed to be the most beautiful creature among God's creation. Light bearer. That's what Lucifer means.
Yes. But...
But Hollywood portrayal of Satan or the adversary has been corrupted by pagan sources. Much of what we perceive as the characteristics of Satan was developed during the middle ages and evolved to include these traits that are not supported by religion
Like,horn, red skin, wings, bad teeth, etc?
