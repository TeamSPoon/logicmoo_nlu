I've never been that interested in baseball.
Really? But you do like some sports, right? I've seen you watching football.
Baseball is too slow for me.
Hmm... I guess there's not as much turnover as there is in basketball or football.
Exactly! And I prefer games that score more highly.
Ha, I have definitely seen low-scoring baseball games.
But you are a fan though, right? What teams do you support?
I support the Cubs primarily.
What city are there from?
Chicago. I also like the Mets.
Wait, aren't they supposed to much worse than the Yankees.
Yup.
So why do you support them?
I like rooting for an underdog. Besides, the Yankees have too many advantages.
What do you mean by that?
Do you know how huge their budget is compared to some of the other teams?
That bad, huh.
It's like they're playing with a loaded deck. And not even playing with it well!
Haha, I see your point.
Thank you! I'll show you a high-scoring baseball game sometime if you're interested; I have some taped.
