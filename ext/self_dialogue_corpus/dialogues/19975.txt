Remember how good 'Queen' was?
Remember?  I still listen to their music all the time.
What's your favorite song that they did?
Well the first one that comes to mind is "We Will Rock You."
Of course.  I love that they still play that song at every sports game ever.
You're right, they really do.  Freddy Mercury was so amazing.
He was one of a kind.  Such a unique and recognizable voice.
How about you?  What's your favorite song by Queen?
Bohemian Rhapsody.  Hands down.
I change my answer.  That's mine too.
Such a perfect song.  It has a little bit of everything.
I really think it was Queen at their best.  It might be ridiculously long, but every second of it matters.
I heard they sold something like 300 million records.
Wow, that's unbelievable.  You really don't hear about too many artists reaching those numbers.
It shows how talented they are.
The fact that even today, their music is so recognizable says so much about their influence on our culture and on music.
Also, they really knew how to put on a show.  All the different looks, styles, and things they did on stage.
Their legacy will last forever.
They drove innovation in music.  And influenced so many musicians today.
A lot of the music we have today, I bet we wouldn't have had without Queen.
