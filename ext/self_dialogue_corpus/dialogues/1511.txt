Hey man, only a few more weeks until the NFL is on again.
Yeah, I know, I can't wait.
What's your favorite team again?
The Atlanta Falcons.
That's right.  They had a great year last year, but it's too bad they couldn't hold on to the lead in the Super Bowl last year.
I know, right?! I thought we had it in the bag.
They should have run the ball more to control the clock instead of throwing so much.
I agree completely.  It seems we kept going 3 and out and giving the ball right back to the Patriots.
Yeah, you can't give Tom Brady the ball back.  He'll make you pay.
Tell me about it.  He definitely made us pay.  But, I'm looking forward to this season.  I think we had a good draft.
Oh really, who did you pick up?
Our first pick was a defensive end from UCLA.  His name is McKinley.  He'll help us pick up and play opposite Vic Beasley who's a beast.
Yeah, Beasley is awesome. Didn't he lead the league in sacks last year?
He did.  He had 15 and a half.  I hope he can do it again this year.
Yeah, that'd be cool.  I like the Falcons too.  I really like Julio Jones because I'm a big Alabama fan.
Yeah, we all knew he'd be really good.
I got to meet him one time and he's actually a really cool guy.
That's great.  The NFL could use some guys that help clean up their image.
Right, as opposed to guys that hit their girlfriends and wives and get away with it.
Totally!  The league needs to get guys like that out of the league!
