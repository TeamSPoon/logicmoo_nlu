Do you like Kansas?
Yes, although I don't know a lot of their songs.
Yeah but what you do know is probably awesome.
Like Dust in the Wind.
Great song. Come on you can't tell me it doesn't get you.
Yeah it does.  It was just written with so much emotion.
You know what else was awesome form them too?
What?
Carry on My Wayward Son.
Yes, basically a perfect song.
Yeah, it has meaning, energy, depth, rock.
Every time I hear it I think of Supernatural.
Yeah, that's a good show.
And that song fit them perfectly.
Ironically, they are from Kansas.
I wonder if that was done on purpose of just a happy accident?
Either way it works for sure.
Yeah, I just wish I could remember more of their songs.
Sometimes it's like that.
I still like them though.
