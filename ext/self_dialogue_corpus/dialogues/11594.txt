My favorite band of all time is The Beatles.
Oh really?  What are your favorite songs?
I have quite a few favorites - some of them are the more popular ones like Let It Be and Hey Jude.
What are some others, like the lesser known ones?
There's one called You Know My Name that I really love.  It's really different.
Oh?  What is different about it?
Well, it's not a typical song.  The listener can tell they were having a lot of fun recording it.
Oh?  How so?
Well, the singers would use different types of voices, rather than just their regular voice.
That sounds really interesting, I'd like to hear it.
