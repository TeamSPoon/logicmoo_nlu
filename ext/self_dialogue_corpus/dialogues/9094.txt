Hey do you remember the REM days?
Oh man you are taking me back. I remember people cutting school to try catch them at the Globe in Athens.
I remember the rumors. It must have been a crazy time to be in Athens. There were so many great bands coming out of that area.
Yeah, the early 80's ...we were begging for rides to get there.
I had friends that had older siblings in school then so they got to go and sneak in to catch the bands.
Yeah, those were days. Things were much more lax then. It must have been great.
Murmur to Document was the high time. That music was great.
I agree. The later stuff had one or two songs but those early albums were all good.
Yep, couldn't touch you play them straight through.
There were some good songs later, but those first albums...amazing.
