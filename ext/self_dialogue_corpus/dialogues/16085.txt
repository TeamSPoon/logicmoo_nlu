Did you hear A Perfect Circle is touring again?
No, I thought they had broken up. That's awesome!
Yeah, they'll be in our area in November.
We'll have to get tickets. Did they put out a album?
No, actually they are using this tour as inspiring the band to finalize and release new material.
So, they're playing a bunch of test gigs?
Basically, that's what they did with Mer de Noms back in 1999.
I had no idea that was what they were doing in that tour.
Well, its a good way to motivate yourself and your band to finish an album.
That's very true.
I really hope they play some old songs mixed in with the new material.
I'm sure they will, they usually throw in a few classics, to keep the fans happy.
I would love to see them play Blue live. I've never seen them do it.
That was one of my favorite music videos that they ever put out.
Didn't they do a bunch of videos for Blue?
Those were fan submissions. It was some kind of contest.
What was your favorite fan submission?
I like the claymation guy in the desert a lot.
I liked that one too. For claymation, it really captured the song well.
It really did.
