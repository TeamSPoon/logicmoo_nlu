How do you feel about the Star Wars: Episode IV â€“ A New Hope movie?
I loved that movie when i was a kid.
I know i must have watched it over 50 times growing up.
Seeing a young Mark Hamill develop into the Luke Skywalker character was great.
Yeah they found the right face for the job.
I gotta say though Harrison Ford playing Solo is my favorite character in the movie.
I always thought they should have gave Han Solo a stand alone movie.
That would be cool, like an origin movie on how he met Chewy.
I would pay to see that in the theater for sure.
They just need to find the right person to stand in for Harrison Ford.
