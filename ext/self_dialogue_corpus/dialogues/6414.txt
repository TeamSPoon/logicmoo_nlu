Who is your favorite Disney Princess?
I would say Jasmine
Yea, the whole Aladdin atmosphere makes her an easy choice
Cinderalla is too cliche
Yea, I didn't really like her story
Snow White is pretty cool though
Yea, those dwarves made her more of an interesting character.
Mulan had an interesting life
I would love to meet her in real life!
You can't! Its fiction
