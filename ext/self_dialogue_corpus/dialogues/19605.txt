Hey girl what's going on?
Marvin Gaye...ha ha.. see what I did there??
You are so lame!!!
Yep and proud of it! I love me some Marvin Gaye and "What's Going on" is ONE of my favorites.
You are right about that. He was smoooooth and amazing.
Yep i think I am going to put that on right now! And  a few others.
I like Mercy Mercy Me.
Oh yes yes yes...my other favorite!
Man why is it all the good ones die young
seriously what kind of freak must his dad have been to shoot his own son.....sick puppy!!
Man some of those outfits  he used to wear were kick ass.
My husband just came in and now he's singing Marvin.
I just put Mercy Mercy me and it's a version I haven't heard before.
Cool! What's different about it?
it was  without music at the beginning and then it's got the ecology mix extended version
Hmmm I haven't heard of that either
Well It looks like Marvin won out for right now
Sweet...enjoy your music feast
I shall! Until next time!
Maybe next time we will go for some.......Luther !
