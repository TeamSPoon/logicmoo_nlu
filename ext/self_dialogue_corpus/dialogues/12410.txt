who is the strongest sith?
I would go with darth vader. He is the ultimate sith.
I suppose that is true.
I think darth maul is cool and pretty great but nothing compares to vader.
What about the emperor?
He is more of a figure head with great powers but vader is the stronger weapon.
Interesting take Vader as a weapon.
Well did the emperor just use him more or less?
I suppose that is a good point.
A very true fact if you ask me.
