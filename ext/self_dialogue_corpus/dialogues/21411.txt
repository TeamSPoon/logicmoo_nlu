What do you think about 80s comedies?
Those are practically the only ones I can watch.
My favorite has to be The Breakfast Club.
That's a great one! Ally Sheedy is great as that goth girl.
Do you have any favorites?
From the 1980s? Who's That Girl is probably my favorite.
Is that the one with Goldie Hawn and Diane Keaton?
No, you're thinking of the First Wives Club.
Which one was Who's That Girl then?
That was the one that stars Madonna as an ex-convict.
Oh I think I've heard of that one. Who else is in it?
Griffin Dunne plays her uptight friend. It's kind of like a remake of Bringing Up Baby.
They remade that one in the 1990s.
I know, with Sandra Bullock. I much prefer Madonna in the role.
But Madonna can't even act!
She's not bad in this one. She's over the top, as usual.
Well, she was never that bad in comedies.
Agreed. But she does take herself a bit too seriously.
Look, as long as I never have to sit through Dick Tracy again, I'll be happy.
That was a mess, but it wasn't Madonna's fault! Blame Beatty!
