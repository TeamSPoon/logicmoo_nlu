Are you excited for the NFL to start in the fall?
I am! Training camp starts in just a few weeks.
Who is looking good?
Well I am a Giants fan, and I am getting worried about Eli Manning's age.
Oh yeah, I feel like he has been around for awhile
Yeah, he is 36 years old.
That is pretty old for an NFL player!
It really is. Hopefully he can get us to the playoffs one more time.
I am more of a Redskins fan.
Oh I don't know much about the Redskins.
They weren't too great last year.
What was their record?
They went 8-7 and had one tie actually, which is pretty rare.
Oh that is weird! Who did they tie?
They tied the Bengals in week eight at the game played in London.
Oh I remember hearing that London might get an NFL team.
Yeah I heard that too. I'm not sure what is happening with that, though.
Me either. That would be pretty cool though.
Yeah, I'd love for the NFL to be more international.
Definitely. It would be awesome if other European nations created teams too.
