If you could see any band in concert, who would it be?
I would love to see Tool in concert.
I have heard they put a really good show on.
Yes same here, and they are still touring as well.
Really? Where abouts have they been touring?
I have heard they play in the Northwest quite a lot.
I would love to see them as well. They had such a unique sound.
Yes they do, it is easy to pick out a Tool song when one is playing.
The lead singer has such a great voice.
I know they made another band, I think it was called A Perfect Circle.
Oh yes, I have heard one or two songs. Same lead singer too.
I am unsure if it is the same other band members though.
I would imagine they use a lot of lights and graphics when in concert.
I have seen some videos of them in concert, and they sound great playing live.
I have heard they sound just like their music when playing live.
Yes, that is rare for some bands to actually sound like the songs they make in studio.
Those are the best kind though, the ones that are real and don't need special effects to sound good.
It is another reason why I want to see them in concert!
Well, we have to go see where they are playing next.
It would be a dream come true to see them play live!
