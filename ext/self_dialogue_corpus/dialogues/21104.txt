Did you hear, they are doing another Dead Pool movie.
Why?
Why? Because Dead Pool was a hit.
It was stupid not a hit. That was an insult to the comic book.
Have you ever read the comic book?
How else would I know that movie was utterly ridiculous?
I thought it was good.
Deadpool is the most asinine superhero ever, at least in the movie.  His character is insufferable, and the story structure is clunky.
You didn't like the humor did you?
Some of the  jokes were good, but most of them were juvenile sex jokes. I don't know how Marvel could let their character be trashed like that.
Money. It rules the world.
The sound, costumes and acting are better than usual, but I don't understand why anyone would claim to have enjoyed watching this bipolar fantasy
I guess it was my kind of movie.
I'm not knocking you. If you liked it, cool beans but I just hated that movie.
Do you think you write a better movie for Dead Pool?
With my eyes closed. He would have been like Dead Pool and less like Spider-Man.
I did think they were trying to make him Spider-Man-ish.
Dead Pool the new anti-super hero movie with a twist.
I still got a pretty big kick out of it.
Goofy movie is what it was.
