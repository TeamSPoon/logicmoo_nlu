Are you excited for the new Star Wars movie?
Not really, I quit watching after the Phantom Menace.
You mean you haven't seen the new one?
Nope.
You have to see it man! It was so much better than the Phantom Menace!
Maybe I'll check it out. What was it called again?
The Force Awakens.
Hmm, I'll have to check it out.
You should, there is another one coming out in December, I can't wait.
Well if I like the Force Awakens, I'll go see it with you.
