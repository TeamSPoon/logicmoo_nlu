Did you see the new Adam Sandler movie?
Which one is that?
It's on Netflix. It's a western movie.
I haven't, is it any good?
I haven't seen it but I heard it's alright.
I haven't liked Adam Sandler movies in a while.
Yeah his movies have really gone downhill.
Were his movies ever great though?
I know. I wonder if it's a nostalgia thing.
Yeah, Billy Madison was funny as a kid.
I liked it a lot back then too.
I'm not sure if I'd like it nowadays.
Maybe we should watch it and give it a try.
Sure we can this weekend.
Maybe we could try the new movie.
Yeah let's go for it.
Okay awesome! I'll be by next weekend then.
Cool cool. I'll see what other movies of his we can rent.
I bet there are some decent ones.
I know I'll look!
