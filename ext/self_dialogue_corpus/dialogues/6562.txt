What's the next Disney movie to come out?
Oh, I have no idea.
I feel like they're always making a sequal or a redo.
Agreed, well they did just release Moana.
Yeah, they also remade Beauty and the Beast.
Have you seen either?
Nope, I wanted to see Moana though.
Yeah, me too. I haven't seen either.
I would rather see a new movie than a remake, you know?
Yeah, that makes sense.
