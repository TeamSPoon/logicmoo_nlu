Do you listen to 'Portugal. The Man?'
Is that the actual name of the group?  I've never heard of them.
Yes.  They're an American rock band from Alaska.
What type of music are they best known for?
I'd say psychedelic pop and indie rock.
Wow, that's an interesting combo.
I think you would like them a lot.
What is a song of theirs that I might listen to and enjoy?
Try 'Feel it Still.'  Very good example of Psychedelic pop.
Okay, I am definitely intrigued.
I saw them in Bonnarroo.  They were so good.
I've never been to Bonnarroo either.
These groups.  They're good recorded, but even better live.
Music is a rather personal experience for me, so I really prefer to listen on my own at home.
That is fair.  Though you do miss out on specific things you can't get on the recorded audio?
Such as?
The fact that these guys just have such great stage presence.  They really know how to put on a show.
I suppose you're right about that aspect.  You go to live shows often?
Not as often as I'd like.  They are rather expensive.
I suppose that means your going to 'Portugal. The Man's' concert was indicative of just how worth it they are.
