Hey are you watching the Broncos game tomorrow?
HELL YEAH!
What to see it in person?
HELL YEAH!  You got tickets?
I do, got bleachers for Evesco Field all year thanks to work.
I knew should of taken  that job.
Duh, a dealership owned by John Elway is going to have perks!
Wait, isn't Terrel Davis supposed to be there this game?
Yes, he'll be signing autographs in the delta hall after the game.
Anyone else?
Yes, Peyton Manning.
Oh My GOD! Payton Manning!  Do you remember that 100 yard pass?
111 yards!
That was savage.
I wonder if he still holds the record?
Yes, second is Brett Farve.
I HaTE Green BAY!
The cheese sure is good though!
Kick off is at 1, we should be there by noon.  So what leave here around 10?
And miss out on the tailgate parties?  I say we leave at 8!
