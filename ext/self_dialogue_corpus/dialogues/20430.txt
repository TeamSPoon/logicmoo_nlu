Have you seen the new Pirates of the Carribean movie?
No, was it good?
Yes! It got really good rating online, too.
I'm not surprised. Those movies are always really good.
Yeah. Jack Sparrow is such a great character. And Will Turner is in it too.
Isn't Barbossa in it as well?
Yes. He plays an important role, as always.
Did it have a good ending?
Well, I don't want to spoil it. But it definitely had some surprises!
That's good. I look forward to seeing it now.
Compared to the other movies int he franchise, it was probably my third favorite. I wasn't a fan of the 4th movie.
Yeah, I felt like the 4th movie was a stretch. But the otehrs were great.
Especially the first one. I mean, I like the others, but nothing will top the first one.
There's just somethign about the mysticism and excitement of the first Pirate's movie.
I agree. Plus, it's a part of my childhood, so I will always hold a special spot in my heart for it.
I heard they're going to make even more. Do you think they will continue to use these new characters?
I think so. They will probbly carry on from this point with the new characters from this movie. I liked them pretty well.
As long as Jack Sparrow stays int he movies, I will always watch them!
I agree. He is the one staple of the movies. Without him, there's no movie.
Exactly. Johnny Depp has done such a good job with his character.
