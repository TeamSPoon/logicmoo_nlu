Are you an NFL fan?
I am. I would say I almost study the game.
That's great to hear. I'm the exact same way.
It's a great sport. I look forward to the season starting every year.
Me too. Who do you think the best running backs will be in the coming season?
Well, you have to look at the guys who made the top 100 players. Ezekiel Elliot is probably number one.
I can agree with that. I don't think their rankings are exactly accurate, though.
True. It does depend a lot on the amount of support the player gets from his team.
Definitely. A running back isn't going to get anywhere without good openings.
Yeah, and that's something that has to be dealt with on the offensive line.
True. I feel like offensive linemen are overlooked.
I agree. They play a very important role.
Just because they're not fast doesn't mean their role isn't as big as, say, a wide receiver.
Exactly. What other running backs do you think will be good this year?
I think Le'Veon Bell is going to do well for the Steelers.
He's definitely up there in terms of running backs.
I also think David Johnson is going to be very impressive this year.
Is that the running back on the Cardinals?
Yeah, you don't hear much about them. He's really good, though.
He does have some impressive stats.
