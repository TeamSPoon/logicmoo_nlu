I just saw She Wore a Yellow Ribbon. I had no idea the Duke could act.
Yes he could, and not just in Westerns. He won a Best Actor Oscar, after all..
I knew he got one, but I thought it was a  longevity prize.
Oh, no, he earned it, I think. They don't give those out just for showing up.
Really. What was he in that wasn't just a Western?
Just a Western? Like The Wild Bunch, The Magnificent Seven,The Treasure of the Sierra Madre or High Noon., you mean?
Oh. You really like Westerns.
Yes I do. How about The Searchers? It's a John Wayne classic, with a marvelous character played perfectly.
Okay, okay.
Or McLintock! It's a rom-com like you've never seen. A Western remake of Taming of the Shrew, if you can imagine.
I  can't imagine.
Yes. Maureen O'Hara is a flaming Katherine, and together they're spicy, and funny, and very self-aware.
Yet he's good at it?
You will laugh. I promise. You can see they had fun making it, too.
He's funny, and so is she?
Or stream The Quiet Man, set in Ireland. He's a retired boxer who finds love at last--with Maureen O'Hara again.
I'll try it.
You'll like it, I think. He  also played a detective, a soldier, and a French Musketeer. And many more.
What a career.
What a guy.
