Do you remember the movie "The Sword in the Stone"?
Yes actually that was one of my favorite movies as a child
Mine too
Funny that you should bring it up, I just watched this the other night with my children
Really?  What did they think of it?
Suprisingly they enjoyed it considering how its from the 60's
Gosh is the movie really that old
Yeah hard to believe I remember it like it was fresh in the theatre
Just goes to show how quick time flies
No wonder my daughter calls me an old fuddy duddy
