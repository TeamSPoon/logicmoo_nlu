It's pretty cool that Disney is making live action versions of their classic movies.
I know, I can't wait to see what they come out with next.
I looked it up online awhile back, it looks like they are making pretty much all of the animations into live action over the next ten years or so.
Wow, really? Even the Little Mermaid?
Yes, that was on the list.
Yay! I can't wait to see it, it's my favorite.
Haha. It was my favorite when I was younger. I think it's the defiant teenage daughter aspect.
What's your favorite one now?
Beauty and the Beast.
That's a good one too.
