Did you see Get Out?
I did, yes! Did you like it?
Yeah. I was surprised by how thought-provoking the film is.
I agree. I was fascinated by how Jordan Peele used the trappings of traditional horror films to comment on race relations.
Oh, that's an interesting take on it. What are you referring to?
Well, for instance, the film uses setting to establish a sense of isolation.
How so?
Well, the couple drive a long way away from familiar territory to visit the girl's parents, right?
Yeah. But how does that comment on race?
Well, it's not as direct as that. A rural or isolated setting is fairly common in horror films, of course, but it's the fact that the movie moves from the multicultural urban environment to a more homogeneous rural one.
So, what you're saying is that the setting sets us up to expect horror and we get a comment on race instead?
I think it's both. It sets us up to expect certain things like a threat and then provides a twist on that threat.
Okay, I think I follow. Do you think any other horror films comment on race?
I think the Danish movie The Celebration deals a bit with race.
I haven't seen it. Is it good?
It's excellent. It's very much in the tradition of Scandinavian psychological horror.
How does it deal with race?
Well, this one woman has married a British man and he's black. Her family doesn't seem to approve, but everything's unstated until alcohol is involved.
That sounds really good. Is it a recent film?
Kind of. I think it came out in the last fifteen years or so. I can't remember.
