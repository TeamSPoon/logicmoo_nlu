The Princess and the Frog is such a fun movie.
I haven't seen it, but I heard the music is good. Is that true?
The music is definitely awesome. It's a really funny movie too.
What's funny about it?
Well, not to give too much away, but the main characters get turned into frogs.
So it's a twist on the classic fairy tale?
Yeah, I really like how Disney revamped the story.
Does it take place in modern times?
It takes place in the early nineteen hundreds I think.
That sounds like it could be interesting.
