I'm really glad we decided to watch Rushmore tonight.
I love Jason Schwartzman.
Honestly I think Bill Murray is better in Rushmore.
Seriously?
Yeah, I mean, his character is just so wacky.
And Jason Schwartzman isn't?
No, but, like, his character is supposed to be out there.
Right.
And Bill Murray is supposed to be normalish, but he's hiding behind trees and running over bikes with his car.
I get it.
It's funnier because of the gap there.
This whole movie is like that. It's nuts.
This might be a top five movie for me. It's definitely my favorite Wes Anderson flick.
More than Royal Tenenbaums?
Yeah. I think so.
Why?
It's just the writing. It feels like he's taking more risks.
That makes it feel more cartoony to me though.
I guess. I dunno. It's hard to go wrong with any of them.
Definitely.
