Do you remember The Fat Boys?
You talking about those three heavy weight rappers from the eighties?
Yeah that's them.
I remember them. They had a couple of hits didn't they?
They had a few. I like the one called In Jail.
I like All You Can Eat.
Really I think those are the only two that were worth listening to.
I remember the light-skin one tried to go solo.
You talking about Marky-D.
Yeah that was him. He made a solo slow jam type love song.
What was the name of it?
I don't remember. I can google it real quick.
Yeah do that.
Wow. It was called I Don't Want To Lose Your Love.
Okay. Why'd you say wow?
Because he made a few solo albums. I thought he only made one.
Good ole Prince Markie Dee. Too funny.
I know right.
I guess we didn't know he made more than one solo album because the music was wack.
And he is still alive. I know one of them died and for some reason I thought it was him.
