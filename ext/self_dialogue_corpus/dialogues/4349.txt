Have you seen 'Memento'?
Is that the one with Guy Pearce?
Yep, that's it. Directed by Christopher Nolan who did some Batman movies.
No I haven't - is it good?
It's amazing. Such a complex storyline but told really well.
Guy Pearce is a great actor, too.
Yeah, he really kills it. Nolan's movies are all great.
I don't think I've ever seen one of his I didn't like.
'Memento' is a little older, but it stands up to time. There's no other movie like it.
I love movies with lots of plot twists and unexpected endings.
