Are you going to any music festivals this summer.
No plans to. You?
Yeah I'm going to one in Main in September. It's kinda a festival of hippie music!
Sounds awesome!
Have you ever been to any music festivals?
Acutally yeah! I just went to Boston Calling a few weeks ago.
Cool! I've been there in years past.
It was a great show, and super fun.
Awesome. Who played?
A lot of my favorites. But Tool also played which was weird.
That is weird!
It was. They totally dind't fit in well with the overall vibe.
Yeah Boston Calling is usually mostly alternative music, not metal!
I just went to one of the food trucks during their set! Who played when you went?
Boy, it's been awhile! My favorite act was the Shins though.
That's awesome! I've been a fan of there's since I saw Garden State.
You, me and most high school kids!
True!
I have a DVD of the fesitval that year if you wanna come watch!
Sounds great!
