Do you like any of the Harry Potter movies?
I do, but only the first and second. They were too complicated after that.
I liked them all. The first and second were great though. Have you seen Emma Watson in "Beauty and the Beast"?
Not yet. I know she's in it, but I don't think it would be of interest to me.
What movies do you like?
Have you seen "When a Stranger Calls"? That's a favorite of mine.
I have! I have seen them both, the older version and the newer version.
I've only seen the newer version, but it is seriously so good.
Can you believe the killer was in the house the entire time and the babysitter had no idea?
That was crazy. I was nervous that he would hurt the children, but thankfully he didn't.
When the babysitter found the housekeeper dead underwater I got so freaked out!
Yes! Same here! That part was scary. The babysitter was smart to hide underwater.
She was, but she stayed inside the house too long. She should've run out as soon as she knew the killer was there.
Agreed. I just think it was harder for her because she had to make sure the kids were okay first.
That's true. I didn't think of that.
Besides Harry Potter, what other movies do you like?
I like the eighties brat pack films. "The Breakfast Club" is a favorite.
That was a classic. Judd Nelson was hysterical, and Ally Sheedy really did a great job on her character.
I read that Ally Sheedy was having trouble playing her part at first, but got really into it as the filming went on.
Wow, I didn't know that. She's a great actress!
