I'm in the mood for a classic thriller movie. Recommendations?
How about "Silence of the Lambs"?
OMG, I've seen it a hundred times. The best! But how about something else?
What about "Psycho" or "Rear Window"?
How about something more recent?
"Gone Girl"?
That's a great one. I'd love to see it again. Good choice.
It's one of my all-time favorite movies of any genre.
It's a great story. Suspenseful. I love the narration towards the end.
It so kept me on the edge. I loved it.
