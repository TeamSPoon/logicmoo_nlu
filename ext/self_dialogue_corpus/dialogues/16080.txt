Have you heard that Saving Abel has a new lead singer?
No, who is it?
Scotty Austin, he is from a small town in Tennessee.
I wonder if he is going to do as well as Jared Weeks did, its hard to change a front man and the band sound the same.
Believe it or not they sound even better now.
How did he do on their best known song 'Addicted '?
In my opinion, even better than Weeks could have on his best day.
That is hard to believe, that song rocks!
have you heard the newest one, ' Blood Stainedx Revolution?"
No, what is it about?
Austin wrote it himself, it is a simultanious statement about the government state and fighting inner demons.
Cool I will have to look it up.
I highly recommend it, awesome video too.
I like most of their older stuff, great bar music.
Austin does a great job with bar ballads.
I like their new drummer
Man he can thrash on those drums, makes for an awesome light show.
Thats what I heard that they had a new drummer.
The bassist whales too, and Austin is nothing short of gifted on the guitar.
I heard he had been playing for a long time and writes all his own music.
