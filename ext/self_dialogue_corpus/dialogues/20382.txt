I watched the movie "Big Fish" last night.
Wow that's an old one isn't it?
It was made in 2003. It was a pretty good movie.
I think I saw it before, was it about a man that was dying and he had told lies most of his life.
Well, I think he enhanced some of his life stories to make them more interesting.
He live in a world where some of the things were impossible, right.
I think that was the point of the plot. You either believed him or you didn't.
Well, his son didn't believe him as a matter of fact he was mad at him about it.
I think the son really wanted to know who his father really was. He was trying to find the truth about him.
I can't remember who were the actors in it.
Albert Finney played the main character,  Jessica Lange played his wife, and Billy Crudup played the son.
Oh yeah, I do remember he worked at a circus for years to get information about the girl he wanted to marry.
I really did like the fact that he stayed at the circus and worked for free just to get a clue about her every month.
See, that right there tells you the man told lies.
Well, I think the point was he felt it was love at first site and would do anything to find his future wife.
Yeah, the big fish didn't think about the other fish in the ocean, did he?
There was a part where the son is talking to a woman and asked if she was his father's mistress. She answered there were only two women in his life, his wife and all the others.
Didn't he turn into a big fish when he died?
Not really, but his son told him a story about him turning into a big fish. He wanted his father to die the way he had lived.
Then his son becomes a story teller himself. See, most men wind up acting just like their fathers.
