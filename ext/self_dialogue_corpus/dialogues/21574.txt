Are you planning on seeing 'Rough Night'?
Oh, definitely! I love 'Broad City', and it's directed by a couple of the writers from the show.
I never really got into 'Broad City'.
You're missing out, big time. That show is hilarious.
It seemed like it was trying a little too hard, the times when I watched it.
Well, then 'Rough Night' might not be up your alley.
The premise looks kind of funny, though. And I do like Scarlett Johanson.
What about Kate McKinnon?
She's hit or miss for me. I love her on SNL, but didn't really like her in Ghostbusters.
The Ghostbusters remake was kind of a weird thing. It had some funny parts, but overall I didn't really enjoy it.
See, I thought it was pretty good, but I just didn't really like McKinnon.
Bottom line for me is that bringing together Ilana, Scarlett Johanson and Kate McKinnon means that I'm definitely up to watch 'Rough Night'.
It kind of had a Bridesmaids type vibe for me, watching the trailer.
Yeah, I could see that. It hit some of the same notes.
Bridesmaids was really good. But so much of the awesomeness was Melissa McCarthy.
She was outstanding in that movie.
I think it's kind of lame to compare movies to other movies just because the casts are all women.
Yeah, but at the same time, it goes beyond that. Both 'Rough Night' and 'Bridesmaids' feature raunchy laughs and some heartfelt moments.
Good point. Well, let me know how good 'Rough Night' is.
If it's as good as Bridesmaids, I'll be sure to recommend it to you!
