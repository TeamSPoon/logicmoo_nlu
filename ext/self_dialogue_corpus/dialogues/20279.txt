You have to see the new Guardians of the Galaxy movie!
Is it the sequel?
Yes it is and it is excellent.
Is it as good as the first?
Well, maybe not on the same level but it's close.
So what's new in number 2?
Kurt Russell joins the cast.
I'm a big fan of his, I love Escape from New York
He's great in it, maybe not what you'd expect.
Oh, do tell.
Well, I won't say anything more as to not give you spoilers.
Gotcha, that's cool. So is everyone on the Guardians team back?
Yes they are.
Any new members?
Yeah, there's a couple but I don't know if they're official members.
Like who?
Nebula seems to have a lose connection to the team and then there's Mantis.
I've never heard of her.
She's an empath and pretty funny too.
Very cool, I can't wait to see it.
