Have you ever seen IRobot?
IRobot?
The movie with Will Smith and the android.
Oh, the movie where he is trying to solve a murder?
Yup.  That's the one.
That was a good movie.
I know!
I thought the CGI was great.
It was.
Will Smith's character was really cool too.
He got jacked for that movie!
I know!  He was pretty big.
I really liked his style in that movie.
His outfits were really cool.
The old school shoes!!!
I'd want to be that guy in the future.
Me too.   I'd have a bunch of cool retro stuff.
I'd definitely want the motor cycle.
Absolutely!
What a great movie!
