So which did you like better the old Star Wars or new ones?
Oh the old ones by far.
Yeah, the prequels just didn't have the same feel.
I can see how some people look at the special effects.  But the writing was awesome in the originals.
However did you see Rogue One?
Yeah, that had the feel of the original movies.
Also crazy special effects.
I know right?  The planet shots of the Death Star were un-real.
I'm hoping that the next movie has that feel to it too.
Oh yeah, on the new ones lets not let Jar Jar off the hook either.
