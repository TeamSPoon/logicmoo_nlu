Have you heard of Justin Bieber?
I am kind of familiar with the name. Who is he?
He is pop-star that appeals to tweens and preteens. Maybe even teens.
Then I don't think I would care for him.
Have you heard the new album by Pink?
No I haven't. Do you like her music?
I am not too familiar with it but I saw you had her on your shirt.
This was the only shirt I could fine to wear; it's my sister's.
Have you heard the new album by Hootie and The Blowfish?
I am not sure I know who they are.
I think they are kind of like a R&B, pop, and rap mix. I am not real sure either.
I will have to look them up.
Did you ever hear the song Keeper of the Stars?
Oh yes. I love that song.
It is by Tracy Byrd.
He is a country singer if I am not mistaken.
Do you know the song She Keeps The Home Fires Burning?
Yes it is by Ronnie Milsap.
I love that song from that country singer.
Me too.
