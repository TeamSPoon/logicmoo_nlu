Have you seen that new movie with Tom Cruise?
I don't think I have, whats it called?
The Edge of Tomorrow.
Oh, I have actually heard of that. Is it any good?
Yes, I loved it. A lot of action.
What is it about?
Basically machines from an alien planet are taking over the world and they can predict all human movements.
Wow, that really sounds intense.
Yep, I highly recommend watching it.
I will have to check it out sometime.
