Wreck-It Ralph was the first Disney movie about video games.
I know. I'm so glad they finally made a movie about video games.
So many fans are represented in that movie, like classics players and new gamers.
I really like how Disney thought out the inside of the gaming machines so well.
What was really cool was how Ralph traveled through different games.
Yeah that was neat, but the best part was that he finally succeeding in something.
Right, I agree.
A movie that can teach kids they can succeed is always important.
And succeeding in video games is one way they can do that!
Well, maybe...
