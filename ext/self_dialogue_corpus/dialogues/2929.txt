Who do you got for the Super Bowl this year?
Has to be the Patriots again, but I think the Packers will surge this year.
Really, do you think Rodgers can win another one?
Absolutely, he's got the arm, their team got better on defense during the offseason.
I saw that, they could make a run, but not the Super Bowl.
Well, who do you have?
I think the Patriots as well, but I think the Falcons are good for the repeat.
You know that never happens, repeats of Super Bowls...
Yea, but there is a first time for everything.
You're right, the Super Bowl went into Overtime for the first time ever.
That was an incredible game!
Yea, except I was in Atlanta, and it was really depressing for the fanbase.
Fortunately you are a Dolphins fan.
Fortunately.
What do you think the Dolphins will do this year?
I say 9-10 wins, they could win the division, but they have to beat the Pats twice.
That won't happen, you can't beat the at Gillette.
You're probably right, but I think they are improved from last year, and they added new pieces.
Well for your sake, I hope you are right.
Me too, all I want for Christmas is a Dolphin playoff game.
