I have the whole weekend off and I am excited!
What all do you think you will do with your free time?
I plan on catching up on some good movies!
That sounds fun, I love watching movies.
I do to, and with work and all I do not get the chance to very often.
I know what you mean! I have been wanting to watch the new Transformer movie but have not got the chance to.
Yea I am thinking that will be a good one. Mark Wahlberg plays in this one as well, right?
Yes he is back for his second Transformer movie. I thought he was awesome in the last one.
I agree with you! He is really good in most movies however.
Yea he is my husband's favorite actor.
Have you ever watched Ted or Ted 2?
Yes! My husband and I have seen them both a few times actually.
I thought they were both hilarious! I could not hardly stop laughing all through them.
I read that they are making a part three in the franchise. I hope it is true!
That would be awesome! I think it would do really well at the box office.
No doubt about that, the first two done very well.
I would say that Ted one and two are my favorite Wahlberg movies. What about you?
I would actually have to say Lone Survivor would be my favorite from him.
I have never seen that one before. Is that the one that is a true story?
Yes, you should really watch it! It was an outstanding film to say the least.
