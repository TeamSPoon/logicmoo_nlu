Who do you think will be the biggest letdown this season?
I'm thinking the Atlanta Falcons as they had a great season last year, but I think this one will be different.
Why do you say that?
Well, they had several balls just bounce their way last year and I just think that they won't be so lucky this year.
I understand as they also lost they also lost their offensive coordinator during the off-season.
Yep, so they will have a different play scheme since the new offensive coordinator is more conservative.
So he's going to want to run the ball more and not pass as often?
From what his record shows, yes, he will be more into the running game.
That could definitely change things, no doubt.
Who are you thinking?
I'm thinking Dallas will have a letdown season.
What? Are you kidding?
Nope, not at all.
With Prescott at quarterback and Elliott in the backfield? No way!!!
They're great players but the offensive line has changed as several linemen left for other teams.
So you see that making a big difference?
Yes, as if the offensive line doesn't block for Prescott and Elliott, they won't be able to run the ball and Prescott will be pressured a lot.
I see your point as if they don't have room to run through, its tough to gain much yardage.
That's what I'm thinking.
Well, we'll see once the season starts and find out which of us is right.
