Are you going to the Third Eye Blind concert next weekend?
I'm not sure yet.  I'm still trying to convince my husband to come with us.
They are one of the greatest rock groups of all time!  What more does he need to convince him?!
Well, he thinks the tickets are too expensive.
Since he's a lawyer, I think he could easily afford to buy the tickets.
Honestly, he doesn't like listening to alternative rock music.
What music does he enjoy?
He likes heavy metal songs from Scandinavia and electronic music.
Really?  I can't stand foreign songs; I love to listen and understand song lyrics!
Me too!  I love singing along to my favorite songs.
Well, if he doesn't want to go to the concert will you come with us anyways?
I don't know yet.  Give me a chance to change his mind!
Remind him of their singles from his childhood!
I will!  I'm sure he's forgotten how much he actually likes their music.
If that doesn't work, try offering to buy the ticket for him.
I would offer but I couldn't afford the tickets on my meager teacher's salary.
Luckily for you, I'd be willing to buy his ticket for him if it means he will come.
You are the best friend I could ever wish for!
You owe me one!
Yes, I do!
