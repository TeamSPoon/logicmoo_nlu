I havent heard anything new from Justin Bieber.
Me either, i wonder why.
Do you think he is on tour or something?
He could be in the studio.
That would be cool. He could also just be taking a break.
Taking a break? Why?
Well, if you are on tour or in the studio, that's a lot of stress. Even tho he is young, you need rest.
That's true. I never though of it that way.
We shoud go look up what he is doing right now!
That's a good idea!
