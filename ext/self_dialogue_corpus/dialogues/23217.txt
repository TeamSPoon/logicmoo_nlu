What do you think of Finding Dory?
It's Nemo???
No. Finding Dory. The new one.
Oh I didn't know that had come out. What happens?
Well, you know how Dory has memory problems?
Yeah
Well, she swims off looking for her family and gets lost.
I never thought about Dory having a family.
Yeah, so she swims all the way to California, and Marlin and Nemo follow her.
Where do they go in California?
The Jewel of Moray Bay. It's a rescue and veterinary aquarium.
Dory is an aquarium fish?
Sort of. She keeps having memories and finally she finds a tank of other fish like her. But none of them are her parents.
Intense.
She leaves feeling really dejected. And then, the fish steal a truck.
Say what?
Yeah, there's an octopus and he drives a semi truck.
AWesome! I'm definitely going to have to see that!
I'll let you figure out the ending when you go see it.
Aw man. No fair!
