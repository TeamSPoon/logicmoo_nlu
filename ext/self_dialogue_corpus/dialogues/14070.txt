How did you like Lady Gagas song 'The Cure'?
It was okay, but I am not the biggest fan of her.
Why is that?
She is a good singer, but she does a lot of extra stuff outside of music.
What do you mean by extra stuff?
She makes a lot of noise outside of making music, I wish she would stay professional and just sing.
I liked her personality and it shows independence.
Maybe you are right about that.
Her music is great and you can't deny that.
I agree the musical aspect of her is amazing.
