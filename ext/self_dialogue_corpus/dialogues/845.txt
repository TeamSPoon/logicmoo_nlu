If you could take any NFL team from any era which would you say is the best?
Thats a tough one. I can take a team from any year?
Absolutely.
I'd say 1985 chicago bears.
Really? Why the bears?
The team they assembled that year was perfect.
That statement sounds exaggerated.
It's not. They put together a perfect offensive and defensive line.
They didn't have a perfect season though.
They ended their season 15- 1.
Exactly, if they were so great the wouldn't of dropped a game.
The thing people fail to remember is their seasons tarted off badly.
I would say I', guilty of that fact.
I mean the only 5 teams out of the league managed to score more than 10 points on them. Their defense was that good.
I see your point. I still don't think they are the best.
Who would you pick?
I'd say the 1972 Dolphins.
Why bescause of their perfect record?
Exactly because of their perfect record.
I think their competion that year just wasn't up to par.
