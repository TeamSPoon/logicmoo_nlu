Do you think their name is kinda weird?
Yeah, that's the first thing I thought.
Yeah, I thought so too.
What all do you know about them?
Well, all they guys met in college I think.
What college was this?
It was Leeds University.
Around when was this?
2007, I believe.
Okay, so they met there and what next?
They started recording on GarageBand.
They couldn't afford a real studio?
I guess not,  they recorded in their hall rooms
Wow! That's crazy.
Yeah, it's part of the reason they sound unusual
What do you mean?
Since they recorded in student halls, they could not  use bass guitars or bass drums
Oh... that is interesting.
Yeah, I really find them fascinating
So far, I like what I am finding out about them.
