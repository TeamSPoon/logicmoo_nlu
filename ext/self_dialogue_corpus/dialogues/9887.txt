Do you ever listen to Gucci Mane?
I can't stand his music.
Really? I don't think he's that bad.
I just think he's overrated. His lyrics are not very impressive
I could see how you'd feel that way. I think it's just meant to be party music.
A lot of rap is going in that direction. I like rap for the lyrics, though.
I agree. I feel like the days of storylines in rap are almost gone.
Yeah, it's sad too. I really enjoy music with a story.
It definitely feels more intellectual that way. I like both styles.
That's respectable. I wish I could get more interested in newer rap music.
