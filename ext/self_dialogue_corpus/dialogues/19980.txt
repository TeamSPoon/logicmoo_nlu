Hi! What are you doing today?
Today I plan to make a new playlist of my favorite songs.
What type of music do you like to listen to?
I like all types of music, but this will be a rock playlist.
Rock music.  I really enjoy rock music too!
Yes, rock isn't my favorite type of music, but I do like to listen to it when I work out.
Oh I bet that it gives you a lot of energy to work out to rock music.
Yep, that's the plan.  I listen to rock music to keep me moving.
That is a great idea!
I've always used rock music when I work out.  Right now I'm a little tired of my current playlist.
I know.  You need to add some Queen to your playlist.
Which song?
How about We are the Champions.  It is a must have at any athletic event.
I guess you are right.
Don't forget We Will Rock you too! I think those two songs are usually played together.
I think you are right.  I'll add them to my playlist.
Wow, you've inspired me to make my own work out playlist.
Good.  Maybe we could work on a list together and then I could share it with you.
I like that idea.  I have a few more suggestions.
Super!  Let's get started.
