I noticed something about almost all Disney movies.  There are almost no 2-parent families.
What do you mean?
Think about it.  Bambi, Cinderella, Lion King, Toy Story(s), Dumbo, Sleeping Beauty...
Wow, I never realized that.
Sometimes there's two but something terrible happens.  Like Finding Nemo.
Are there any with whole families?
The Incredibles has both parents.  Maybe Brave?
The one with Merida?  Yeah, I think so.
They sould show more 2-parent families.  Even same-sex couples.
Right, that doesn't imply some sort of tragedy or divorce.
