I really think the Celtics are setting up to be a dynasty
I hope so but they will never be the dynasty they were in the 80s
I grant you there is no Larry Bird but the rest of the core are much younger and more athletic
but they don't have Larry  Bird or anything close
not right now but they are a finals caliber team and are going to get the # 1 pick in the draft
I hope they get there but  they still wont have the mystique of the old days
Yes I give you that  . Stern and Jordan really set basketball back a long ways taking it from a team game to 1 on 1 star matchups
yup they don't even pass anymore
This is why i prefer college basketball
me too  even that game is ending up more and more like the pros lowering the shot clock, isolation game .  etc...
They cant ruin college basketball too much . They can make it top heavy  so that the Carolinas and Kentuckys will always win the championship  but the lower conferences are..
yes the lower conferences will always be watchable with good team basketball
Isnt it great when those lower seeds play good team basketball stay all 4 years in college  and beat those factories
Thats why CBS pays billions to broadcast it
A chance to win a lot of money in your local bar bracket doesnt hurt either
I wouldnt know i havent won since 1995
ohthat was a great tournament  UCLa won it right ?
yup I am forever indebted to Tyus Edney
That was the most amazing play  !!!
Right ut they will forever show laettners basket because it was Duke and Kentucky
