I'm really looking forward to the new infinity wars marvel movies.
Me too! They are going to have so many superheroes in them!
Yea, I wonder how they are going to even fit that many characters into one movie.
Maybe they will spread them out over several movie chapters.
No, they all have to be on screen at the same time for a lot of the scenes.
Wow, so that's a lot of people then.
Yea, there's hawkeye, black widow, captain america, spiderman, thor, and even antman.
Yea and you can't forget about the hulk too, he's huge.
Yea and what about all the members from guardians of the galaxy?
Oh yea! I wouldn't be surprised if they brought in some new people as well.
Don't forget about iron man. I wonder if Robert downy junior will retire as ironman after the infinity wars.
Maybe. I wonder if they will get deadpool in there?
No, I'm not sure that they are allowed to have any xmen in marvel movies.
Why not?
Well, I think they are owned by fox? I'm not really sure.
Oh I see, well that's a shame then, because you have to have the xmen in there.
I know, it's a bummer, but let's get real, how could they put all the xmen along with all those other superheroes in the same movie?
Yea I guess that's true.
This also means no deadpool appearance either.
Wow, that really sucks!
