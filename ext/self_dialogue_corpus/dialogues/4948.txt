Did you think Pete Rose should be banned from the Hall of Fame?
No. I think his accomplishments speak for themselves. But what about his sins?
You mean like gambling on the sport he played for?
Exactly. Do you think that overshadows his accomplishments?
I personally don't, but the majority of other people do.
I dont think its right, I think he should be in.
How would you convince other people to think that way?
Ha! Thats easy. I would prove to them he deserves it.
And how would you do that?
He's an all-time MLB hits leader! How do you not put him in???
Because he disgraced the game by gambling.
Fans like you disgrace the game by disgracing his legacy!
What else has he done?
He's the all-time leader in games played, singles and outs! You cant deny his greatness.
So he's the all-time MLB leader in hits, games played, singles and outs?
Yep.
How do they even make an argument for keeping him out.
Exactly.
What about his gambling?
What about it? He didnt boost his stats or his performance so screw it.
