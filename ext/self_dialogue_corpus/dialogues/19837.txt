Who's your favorite band?
Steve n Seaguls
I've never heard of them.
Their this great little band out of Norway or Sweden or something.
Really, that's odd.  What kind of music do they play?
Well, they take and grass up heavy metal songs.
Oh, I've heard some of that kind of thing.  Not them though.
Their the best.  They have some good videos on YouTube.
I'll have to check them out.  What songs do they do?
They do a few AC/DC songs and some Iron Maiden.  My favorite is Thunderstruck.
Excellent song.  I'm a big AC/DC fan.
Yeah, me too.  But these guys do it with a banjo and accordion and an old box drum.
Cool, sounds pretty good to me.  Some of those bluegrass bands can really play.
These guys sure can.  And they got a good sense of humor too.  Their YouTube videos are pretty funny and they rock at the same time.
Far out. I'll check them out.  Have you heard them on the radio?
No, not yet.  While your at it you should check out the Two Cello's on YouTube too.  They do the same with cello's
The same what? Heavy Metal?
Yeah,  they also do Thunderstruck but with two really cool cello's.
Just the cello's or with a band?
No, just the two of them, but they sound like a whole band.  You've never heard cello's like this.
