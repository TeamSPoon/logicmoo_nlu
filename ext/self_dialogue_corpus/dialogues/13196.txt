Ok, do you think that Jar Jar is a Sith?
Why would you think he's a Sith?
There's a theory going around that he is.
What do the theory's say?
Well, if you look at his eyes, they look just like a Sith's?
You mean because they're yellow?  Go on.
And in one of the films he uses a force jump, even though he doesn't use the force.
People may be onto something.
I know, just imagine if when the new films come out he's a Sith lord!
I can't imagine peoples' reactions!  What if the annoying voice was just an act?
