Have you listened to Mouse on the Keys before?
I do not think so, who are they.
They are a Japanese Jazz band.
I definitely have not.
Have you heard other music in that genre?
Are they like Fox Capture Plan?
Yea, they actually sound quite similar.
Sounds like I would enjoy them then.
Check out their song Leviathan.
Wow this song is pretty intense.
Yea, it calms down a bit though.
This is really nice, do you know of any other bands like them?
Toconoma is similar but a little lighter.
I listen to them all the time, love them.
Also, bohemian voodoo is really great.
I have heard good things about them.
Those are the main ones I can think of now.
Thanks for the recommendations!
No problem, glad you enjoy the music.
I always enjoy your recommendations.
