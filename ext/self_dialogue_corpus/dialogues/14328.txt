You going to the game tonight?
Nah no way i can i am stuck at home babysitting
Thats a shame i was wanting to go tonight.
You can go but catch some highlights for me though at least.
I am hoping to do more than just catch a few highlights.
What do you plan to do?
I want to get something signed to make it memorable
Good luck with that it will never happen.
It will too just watch.
If you say so man.
You better turn the game on and watch then because you will see
I will turn the game on then you know the time it will air.
It will be airing on TBS at around seven is the time you should check it.
I will try to watch it but i will most likely just listen as i will be busy.
Nah man you gotta see it if you can to catch the fun of it all
I will try i want to look at the stats though what site do you use for the team stats?
I usually just use ESPNs tracker as it is easy.
I was thinking you used another site.
Nah i find ESPN the easiest way to track the players
