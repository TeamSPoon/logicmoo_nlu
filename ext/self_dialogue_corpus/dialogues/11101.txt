Did you see the Met gala last week?
The Met gala no. What's that?
It's an event in New York where people wear crazy fashion.
No. I didn't. I love red carpet apparel.
I do too. I like it when the celebrities tell who they are wearing. Oscar de la renta
Vera wang or what about Christian Seriano.
Didnt he dress Leslie Jones from SNL when no one else wanted to because of her size?
Yes. Christian won me over fter than. Fat and fashipn shaming is wrong.
I agree. More designers should cater to all body types. What about the plus size model who is out now.
Yes. I love her. She looks good in everything. i saw her in a Versace dress the other day.
That has to be made to fit her because Versace is normally for the 0-4 range.
I also like to look fashionalbe on a budget. I found so many websites that have nice clothes cheap.
I love a bargin. my aunt goes to the salvation army every weekend. She finds so many designer fashions.
Lijke what? i can never find anything good.
She finds Coach and Cold water Creek. Cashe and black house white market all the time.
Is the fashion she finds gently used?
Yes. You would never know it was hand-me-down.
Sweet. I find a lot of high fshion on eBay. Kenneth Cole is my husbands favorite.
Yes. You can get some good deals online.
I agree. High dollar fashion and cheap rates.
