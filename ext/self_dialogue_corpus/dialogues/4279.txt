What was the name of that movie where Collin Farrell was stuck in a phone booth?
Phone Booth?
Yeah, he was stuck in one.  And if he moved, they would shoot.
No, that's what I'm saying.  The name of it was Phone Booth.
Oh, I get it now.  I feel stupid.
I remember seeing that and being in awe of his acting.
I don't remember it.
Well, I just remember he totally lost his accent.
I'm sure he does that for all his roles.
I wouldn't be able to do that.
