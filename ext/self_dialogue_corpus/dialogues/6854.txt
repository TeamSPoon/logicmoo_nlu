Did you see Moana?
Yes!  I loved it.  My daughter didn't like it as much though and I don't know why.
Maybe she was comparing it to Frozen.  I heard a lot of people were.
Maybe.  I personally loved the songs in Moana.
Me too.  I feel like Disney is really having a big revival recently.
They're also making all those live versions of their old films.  That could go on for quite a while.
I think I heard they're doing one for The Lion King.
I will definitely have to check that out.  Beauty and the Beast was great.
I thought so too.  Emma Watson wasn't really that great in it to me though.
Really?  I thought she was exactly how Belle should act.
