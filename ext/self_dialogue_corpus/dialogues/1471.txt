Hey, are you a Chicago Bears fan?
Yes, my family is from Chicago
What do you think of their moves this offseason?
I'm a little bit puzzled by them signing a QB and then trading up to draft Trubisky with the third pick.
I agree, it almost seems like their GM didn't plan things out very well
Yeah, but I'm glad they got rid of Jay Cutler.
For sure, Cutler has been a burden on the team for years now
I agree, I liked him at first but the more he played and the more I saw him throw intercepts and then pout on the sidelines the more I knew he wasn't the guy
As Greenbay Packer fan I felt the exact opposite when I saw him throw a pick.
How do you think the Packers will be this year?
I'm expecting a season similar to last year.
Do you think they improved over the offseason?
Possibly, I think their running game will be better but their defense will be about the same.
So that means their defense will be bad right?
Well I know Bear's fans have seen lots of examples of bad defense the last few seasons, but I don't think it will too bad.
Hey! The Bear's defense wasn't that bad last year
Only bad enough to net the Bears a top five draft pick.
You can't blame that all on the defense.
But you can't say that the defense was very good either.
That's a fair statement.
