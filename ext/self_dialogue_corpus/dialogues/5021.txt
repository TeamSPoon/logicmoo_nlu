Did you watch the Indians game last night?
I didn't, but I heard about it today on ESPN!
You should of saw it, Kluber struck out 15 and was unhittable.
Really? At least he finally got some run support.
Yeah, Santana hit a homerun and two doubles.
He always seems to hit the Royals well.
Well if he can stay healthy, I think the middle of the order is set for the Tribe.
Yup, it was good that they let Napoli walk in the offseason, or else they might need another bat.
Do you think that the Indians will win the Central?
I do. There isn't another strong team in the division this year.
Well, if they make it back to the Series, they might not be seeing the Cubs this year.
Nope! They look lost after last year.
One of the strengths of this Cleveland team is their bullpen.
It sure is. Miller hasn't even given up a run yet this year!
The way Francona manages this team is the best I've seen since Mike Hargrove.
Not even close, Francona is the best manager Cleveland has had in my lifetime.
Who is pitching tonight for the Tribe?
It's supposed to be Tomlin.
Good. He has had a pretty decent year so far.
I know. I'm going to the bar to watch it tonight. Go Tribe!
