must be hard being a bills fan
yeah right
losing 4 super bowls in a row
thats crazy
i think the lost 4 in a row because of how the lost the first
maybe
how do you miss that field goal
you kick it wide
well i know that
well you asked
i mean how do you miss it
pressure on him
had to be a lot
well yeah. its the super bowl
sill have to do your job
that you do
but Wr drop passes all the time and nobody bats an eye
they would if they dropped it in the endzone with no time on the clock
your right
im always right
