When you are at home with your husband, who gets to pick what you watch on the television?
Definitely my husband, he hates the movies I like to watch.
Do you like the movies he likes to watch?
Sometimes, but he really likes action and shoot them up movies.
What kind do you like?
I like romance or comedy.
What was the last movie you watched with your husband at home?
I think it was Deadpool with Ryan Reynolds.
Oh the one where he plays Spiderman?
Well he isn't Spiderman but his costume sort of looks like that.
Oh, I thought is was a Spiderman turns evil kind of movie.
No, Ryan Reynolds plays this man named Wade Wilson who was a former Special Forces operator that becomes a mercenary.
I thought Ryan Reynolds usually did comedies.
This is a comedy action type of movie. Wade is tortured, disfigured, and transformed into his character Deadpool.
That doesn't sound very funny.
Reynolds could make a cold sore funny but he has a super power that helps him heal very quickly.
Who else is in the movie?
Ed Skrein plays Ajax this evil scientist that turned Wade into Deadpool.
Did you like this movie.
Yes, I really did enjoy it and my husband said there is a sequel, so when it on television we will probably watch it.
