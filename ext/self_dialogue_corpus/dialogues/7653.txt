If you could see a side movie about any Harry Potter character who would it be?
Mad Eye, no doubt.
Yeah, he was one of the best characters.
I'd like to see how he fought in the fist wizard war.
He was awesome.  Scary good guys are always the best kind.
I know right?  I'd also like to see him before he was all beat up.
It would be great to see him accumulate the scars one by one.
And see how he takes out some of the most fearsome Deatheaters.
They should give him an enemy that he goes back and fourth with.
And maybe even a few scruffs with Voldemort himself.
