So, what is your favorite Marvel movie?
I like Captain America the most. What about you?
I like Iron Man the most. Why do you like Captain America?
Well, it's the typical underdog story line. Plus, I just like how honorable Captain America is.
He's too goody two shoes for me.
Is that why you like Iron Man - Tony Stark as the bad boy?
Yeah, I guess so. He's not perfect, he doesn't have everything in order.
That's true. But, he just is too snarky for me.
I guess that makes for good conflict in the Avengers movies, later on.
I agree - Tony and Cap have to work out their differences with each other.
