What do you think of Three Days Grace?
I haven't listened to them since Adam left.
Why not?
Because his voice is irreplaceable to me. That's just something I don't like for bands to do.
What? Change singers?
Yes, especially when they've been established for so long. It gets to the point where you can't hear anybody else but them singing the songs.
I guess I get that, but you should still give them a chance.
Is the music at least still the same.
Yes. It's exactly the same, really.
What about the new singer? What're they like.
Matt Walst. He sounds different from Adam, but his voice still fits well over the music.
Any songs I should look out for?
I'd say Painkiller. It has the musical structure of any Three Days Grace song.
And the vocals are good?
In my opinion, they are.
I'll take your word for it.
It comes off of an album. It's called Human.
I'll look up the song first.
If you like the song, check out the album.
I'll see what I think.
