What do you think of Tom Holland as Spiderman?
He was great in Civil War. So far I really like his version of Spiderman.
I agree, he was my favorite part of that movie. Seeing him fight the Avengers was amazing.
Do you have a favorite Avenger? Mine is Captain America.
Mine too. Captain America: The Winter Soldier is one of the best Marvel movies.
That movie was great. It really expanded on Steve Roger's character.
It really did. Plus it featured a lot of great characters.
Yeah Falcon, Black Widow, and Winter Soldier were all great in that movie.
After Captain America, I think my other favorite hero is Black Widow.
Scarlett Johansson is very good in that role. I hope they make a solo Black Widow movie some day.
