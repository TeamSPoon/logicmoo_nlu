Did you know that certain Disney movies are available on Hulu now?!?
No way! That's all I used to watch growing up!
Me too. They have Hercules on there which is one of my favorites.
You know Hercules is what got me into greek mythology...
I didn't know that but I totally get it. They had so many different characters in it.
Yeah I was a big fan of Hades too! Haha!
He was so funny and sarcastic!
Yeah and the sidekicks, Pain and Panic, were funny too!
I really liked Meg too. I think I related to her a bit when I was growing up. She came off so cool!
She was super cool! No damsel in distress there.
