Do you like Wes Anderson movies?
Not really. How about you?
Yes, some of my favorite movies of all time.
Which one is your favorite?
I would probably have to say The Grand Budapest Hotel
Why do you say that?
Great acting and a really good story line. Should've won best picture.
Any other ones that you like in particular?
I really liked Moonrise Kingdom and Bottle Rocket as well.
I don't recall hearing about Bottle Rocket.
Yeah, it was his first movie. Came out in the mid 90s.
Who was in it?
Owen and Luke Wilson. I believe it was their first film as well.
Really? I may have to check it out.
Yeah, deals with a failed robbery attempt. Kind of silly in parts.
Interesting. Did it win any big awards
I don't think so. It's one of those movies that flew under the radar.
Has it aged well?
Don't know for sure. I haven't seen it in awhile.
Okay, maybe I'll check it out later this month.
