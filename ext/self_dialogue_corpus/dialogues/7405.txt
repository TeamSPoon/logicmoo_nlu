Did you see that new Star Wars movie that recently came out?
Yes, but it sure is dissapointing compared to the George Lucas Star Wars.
True, Disney making new Star Wars movies is a disgrace.
Well, you know how businesses operate these days. Disney of course sees alot of profit in making new Star Wars movies.
I understand, it's just dissapointing in the sense that you know they aren't going any good Star Wars movies that can compete with the original Star Wars movies.
On the bright side, we get to see new lightsaber battles on screen
Yes, but that is for the casual audience.
Absolutely, I know that Star Wars is about having a good story.
I thought it was cool how Samuel L Jackson played Mace Windu in the Star Wars prequels.
Yes, I heard he even demanded that he gets to have a purple lightsaber made just for his character.
