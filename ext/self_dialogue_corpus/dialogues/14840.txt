Do you want to watch this? Mike and Dave need wedding dates?
I don't know, what's it about.
It's actually pretty good. It's Zach Efron and the guy from Workaholics, and they are kind of crazy so they hire dates for their sisters wedding.
Okay, so who are the dates?
It's actually Aubrey Plaza and Anna Kendrick. It's funny because they turn out to be just as crazy as the guys.
How so? Are they like party animals?
Yeah, and they just have a tendency to screw things up like the brothers.
This actually seems like a pretty good movie. i haven't seen a movie like this before.
It's not bad, there are a lot of really funny bit's in it.
Yeah let's watch it. I love Aubrey Plaza.
