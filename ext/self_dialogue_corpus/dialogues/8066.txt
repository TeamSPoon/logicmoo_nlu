Can you believe Adele's success at the Grammys this year?
Even though it was not brand new, that album she won for, 25 is pretty amazing.
I really like her voice on the song Hello.
Yes, that song showcases her talent very well.    What were the other singles?
I know Water Under the Bridge is the most recent release.
Definitely!    Love the lyrics of that song.
You don't think it is just another relationship tune?
Maybe, but I don't get people calling it cheesy.
For sure.    This is her third album, and the style is set.    Know anything about the next one?
Haven't heard anything.     Hope it isn't nearly five years like between 21 and 25.
