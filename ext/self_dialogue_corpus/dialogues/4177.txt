Did you ever see that crazy Harrison Ford thriller where his whole family got kidnapped?
I don't think so. When did it come out?
I think it was bout ten years ago.
It doesn't ring a bell. Do you remember what it was called?
It had something to do with computers. Oh, it was Firewall!
I remember seeing previews for that, but never saw it. Is it worth a watch?
I think if you like thrillers, you'd like this movie. It's not deep, but it's a fun ride.
Is it dark though? I don't like movies with sad endings.
No, I don't think so.
Maybe I'll have to watch sometime then!
