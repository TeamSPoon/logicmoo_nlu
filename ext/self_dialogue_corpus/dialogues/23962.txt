You've seriously never seen The Music Man?
No. Ew, I don't do musicals.
But it's a classic!
I especially don't do classic musicals.
You need to see it if only so you can understand when I say pool is trouble.
We'll see. Musicals are usually boring.
But this musical has cons, deceit, moral decay and corrupt youth!
I'm slightly interested.
It's actually one of those musicals that seems like it could be more modern than it is.
How so?
I'm not sure, it's like... a lot of actors in musicals seem sappy and corny but Robert Preston, who plays the lead role, almost seems to be playing his role ironically or in a very self-aware way if that makes sense.
Doesn't sound too bad. Is he handsome?
Relatively. You'll be happy to know there are librarians and love interests.
You know I'm all about the librarians. Does the librarian get their own song?
Indeed she does. My favourite song from the movie is "trouble" though.
Is it about pool?
It's about pool and so much more. It really explains the whole premise of the movie in that song.
That it's about pool?
That's just one part of it. It explains how Robert Preston uses pool for his scheme. You really just have to watch it.
I'll watch it and if I don't like it, no bothering me about musicals ever again.
