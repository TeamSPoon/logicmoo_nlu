Have you seen any of the fast and the furious movies?
Yea, I saw the first couple I think.
How did you like Tokyo Drift?
It was not my favorite.
Yea. It felt a little out of place to me.
Same. Did you see all of them?
All but the last one that just came out.
That's cool. Does Tokyo Drift fit in the series better after you have seen most of the movies?
Yea it fit in better. It helps you understand the characters more.
Oh ok. I will have to watch them.
