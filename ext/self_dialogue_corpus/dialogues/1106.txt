Do you think the panthers will bounce back this year?
I hope not.
You don't like them?
Not a big fan of cam newton.
I'm not either.
Well they open in San Francisco.
That should be a win.
Game two is home against the bills.
That should be another win.
The home for the saints.
Not an easy game.
Then they go to New England.
Oh boy,that's not a win.
Then they have the lions,eagles and bears.
All winnable games.
They could also lose those games.
They also get the falcons twice and green bay at home.
Not an easy schedule.
But they have the jets away.
Another win for them.
