Did you watch the game last night?
No, who was playing?
The Anaheim Ducks.
Who were they playing against.
The Sharks. It was a close game.
No way! Why didn't you call me!
I tried to call you.
I should check my voicemail more often.
I didn't leave a voicemail.
You should have called my wife.
Why should I have called your wife?
To tell me about the game.
I'm not calling your wife about a Hockey Game.
That seems fair.
So don't you want to know who won?
No, don't tell me.
Why don't you want to know?
I may watch it on replay.
That sounds exciting.
It will be if no one spoils it for me.
