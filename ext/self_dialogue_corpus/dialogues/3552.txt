Do you like slasher horror films?
I must admit that all though the freak me out i do enough them quite a bit.
Do you have a favorite one?
I like most of the Friday the 13th movies and the Halloween movies as well.
Did you get to watch all the Scream movies?
The Scream movies are great, i love what they did with the slasher movie concept.
Yeah, having a killer that is fixated on serial killers and slasher movies is a bit of a twist on the genre.
I hope they make another one in the future.
Who knows, they will probably end up rebooting the whole franchise for the next generation of kids waiting to be terrorized.
Well i'll be on deck waiting to buy a ticket myself.
