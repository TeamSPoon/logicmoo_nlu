You study music right?
Yes, and I teach it.
Do you ever listen to it on the radio?
You mean on NPR or the classical stations?
Yup!
No. I avoid it wherever I can.
Why?
Well, if I'm driving, classical will put me to sleep unless it's the right piece.
Ahh, Mozart will cause crashes.
I can't stand those stations
Why not?
It's nearly impossible to listen to someone NOT be a snob.
They're kind of elitist, aren't they?
Yup! They play a super-obscure piece that even I don't know and then say "of course, that was Mozart's K.655"
Ha, they use the Kershel number when calling it on the radio?
Yup! As if it's common knowledge.
We all know the K-system but that's crazy.
Plus, classical stations don't really reach well up here due to their low frequencies.
Gotcha.
Good in concept but really hard to keep going.
