Did you see Toy Story when you were younger?
Yeah, it's my favorite movie!
Woody was my favorite character, what about yours?
I really liked Buzz Lightyear!
Buzz was cool, I had a Buzz toy when I was a kid.
That's awesome, could he fly?
No, just like the movie he couldn't.
Would have been cool if he had.
Yeah, but he lid up and said cool phrases.
I should get one of those for my nephew.
