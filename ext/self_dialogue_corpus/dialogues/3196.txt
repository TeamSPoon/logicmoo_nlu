how are you feeling about the upcoming nfl season?
I feel good and am ready to play.
do you think that the injury you experienced in the off season will inhibit your play this year?
No, I feel like I am fully healed and ready to get on the field.
How has the hamstring injury and recovery changed your approach to the season?
I am more aware of my surroundings and who is on my back guarding me so I don't pull it again.
Have you changed your workout routine because of it?
Yes, I make sure that I do extra stretches now to make sure it's worked oout before game time.
What has gotten through the off season injury?
My family's support and great rehabilitation doctors who made sure I was healing at a normal, healthy pace.
What are you most looking forward to this game?
I just want to go out and show the fans and the team that I am ready to go and good as new
do you anticipate any struggles facing the Bengals tonight?
Well, they are a tough team but we are definitely tougher!  I think it'll be a challenge, but one we will win!
Talk a little about the addition of the new linebackers.  Do you think they will be a good mesh with the team?
During practice they show they are fierce and loyal.  We mesh well as a team and are ready to play
That's great to hear!  Is there any team that you aren't looking forward to facing this season?
I think the Patriots will give us a run for our money this year.  Brady is on his game but we gotta watch out for those deflated balls!
That's a great point!  How did you feel about the whole "deflate gate" thing?
I think it is unfair and there's never a need to cheat.  Football is a game that is to be played with honor.
