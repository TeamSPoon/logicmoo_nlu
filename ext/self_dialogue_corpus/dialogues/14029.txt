Do you ever listen to Lady Gaga?
She is one of the few newer singers I will listen to occasionally.
Do you like her music?
It is okay, I wouldn't buy it, but I won't change the radio station if it comes on.
What's your favorite song by her?
Probably bad romance I would say.
Same here.  I think it is fun to see what she is going to do next.
Yeah, she really knows how to push the envelope.
She sure does.  She makes things entertaining.
She is certainly different.  In a good way though.
