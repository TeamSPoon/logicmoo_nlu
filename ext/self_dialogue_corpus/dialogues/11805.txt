What do you think about the White Album?
I consider it their greatest album and ny favorite.
Are the Beatles the greatest group of all time?
Considering that they changed the world of music, I would say yes.
Should Paul and Ringo get together on a new album?
They probably won't but the world would welcome it.
The Abbey Road album has that iconic picture of the lads crossing the street.  Your thoughts?
I'm not impressed with it. I mean, they're just walking across the street. No big deal.
What was going on with Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds?
I think they really were tripping on LSD when they wrote that one.
