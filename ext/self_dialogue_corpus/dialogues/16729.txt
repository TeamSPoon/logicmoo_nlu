Hey, have you ever heard of Tool?
I've heard of them but haven't really listened to them.
Oh well you should really check them out, they're a great band.
What kind of music do they play?
Progressive rock.  It's some really interesting music.
Hmm.  Give me a song recommendation.
Start off with something like "Sober" or "Vicarious."  They're awesome songs but still pretty mainstream.
Okay, I'll definitely check it out.  How long have they been around for?
Tool has been a band for years now.  The lead singer is Maynard James Keenan, and he has two other bands also.
Really?  What are they?
Puscifer and A Perfect Circle.
Oh cool.  Are they the same genre?
No, A Perfect Circle is a bit lighter than tool and Puscifer is hard to classify.
Would you recommend these bands too?
Oh definitely.  If Tool is too hard for you, try A Perfect Circle.  They're a lot more melodic.
Okay great, I'm definitely more into melodic music.
You don't be disappointed with A Perfect Circle then.  They make beautiful music.
What song do you recommend?
Try "3 Libra's."  It's a popular song and quite beautiful.
Okay great, I'll check it out.  Thanks!
