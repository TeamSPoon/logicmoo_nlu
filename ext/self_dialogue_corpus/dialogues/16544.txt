So, what's your favorite older music?
I like Genesis, among others.
Really?  Which Genesis is your favorite?
What do you mean, which Genesis?
Phil Collins, or Peter Gabriel, I mean.
Wait, Peter Gabriel was in Genesis?
Yes, but it's been a long while.
Wow, I guess I didn't realize that!
You really should find some of their old albums, and give it a listen.
Do they still sound like Genesis?
Well, if all you have heard has been Genesis with Phil Collins, you will probably be surprised.
It is really different, then?
Oh, yes.  But not in a bad way.
That's good to hear.
Some of the songs are really kind of trippy, I think.
Oh really, which ones?
Some of the earlier ones.  I think they must be from the sixties.
Well that would explain it, then.
You really should try their old stuff out, just for fun.
I will.  Think for the neat music trivia!
