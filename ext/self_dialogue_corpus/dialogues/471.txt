We're getting closer to the start of the new NFL season with each passing day!
I know! GOOOO PACKERS! They finally got some help for Aaron Rodgers.
Haha, not as much help as you think. I have the Lions winning that division.
Stafford is good, but he's not that good. Rodgers is still the best QB and that's what wins in the NFL.
Well, at least we agree it won't be the Vikings.
No, definitely not. They don't have a running game since Peterson left.
And the Bears are atrocious.
Chicago should not have traded up for Trubisky. The upcoming draft is going to be so much better for QBs.
They'll be picking high in the draft again with how bad their team is. I actually think Trubisky could be good but not anytime soon.
Mike Glennon will never be good.
Hah! Who do you have coming out of the AFC?
Brady just keeps going and going, like the Energizer Bunny.
Yeah, he works hard to stay at the top, but he's almost 40 years old.
He takes care of himself, personal trainers, specialized diet and all that. He could play for a bunch more years even.
The two other teams I think could beat New England in the AFC are Kansas City and the Raiders.
Oakland gets Derek Carr back and could be a threat but I can't see Alex Smith outgunning Tom Brady.
Pat Mahomes will be in there sooner rather than later, mark my words. Big arm throwing deep to Hill and Kelce.
That's an intriguing visual but, as a rookie QB, those deep throws often end up directly at a defender. And he's a gunslinger, he'll try it and fail before he learns.
One thing about the NFL is, there are always unexpected big jumps. We're making our best guesses but they'll probably turn out wildly wrong.
Yup. Jacksonville Jaguars, the next Super Bowl Champs.
