I love music
So do i
There is literally something for everyone
And every mood too
Yes that too
I used to love the backstreet boys
Me tooi still know all the words to there songs
So do i
My favorite was everybody backstreets back
And that music video that was like mochael jacksons
They were a great band
Still are
I wish they did more music
Me too
Nsync was okay too
Yes they were
Justin timberlake is the only really popular one now
I wonder why
Me too
Hes good though
