I can't stand this new rap music, I think it's all garbage. What happened to the great 90s artists, like 2pac and Biggie?
That's a really closed-minded statement man! Not all rap music is like the stuff you hear on the radio, you gotta listen to underground stuff.
What kind of underground stuff? Do I look like I live in a hole to you?
That was a good one man. But anyways, you should check out SoundCloud, there's a lot of great rappers on there who aren't getting the exposure they deserve.
Care to name a few rappers for me to look up when I get home?
Well, if you're into alternative or experimental stuff, I'd recommend Bones and xxxtentacion. If you like Three 6 Mafia, check out $uicideboy$.
Man, those rappers have some pretty weird names.
Take my word for it man, you won't be disappointed.
Alright, I'll give them a chance. Any more rap recommendations?
Dude, I'll send you my Soundcloud on Facebook when I get home. I have a bunch of rap playlists you should check out.
