I cant wait to see the next Avengers
I dont think they are doing another one
I believe they are
NO I think its going to be Infinity War
Is that going to be an epic film?
It will feature the Avengers and alot of other Marvel characters
Is that the one with Thanos?
Well if you look at the end credits in alot films, yes.
I am interested in seeing that.
It could be the last we see of the current characters
They are going to retire them?
No but it looks like they might have new actors take over the roles.
I dont know how I feel about that.
Yeah I know what you are saying
But then again I have dealt with 3 different Spiderman actors
Yeah and you probably latched onto each, right?
Well the first 2 for sure.
I think the movie might be 3 hours long
Thats too long for a theatrical release
Yeah I know but they have a story to tell
