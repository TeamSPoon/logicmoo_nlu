I saw a Nicole Kidman movie the other day with a really cool twist ending.
Hmmmm, not sure what movie you are talking about.
It's called The Others.
Oh, I gotcha.  Yeah, I remember that film.
The ending was very creative, didn't you think?
How they didn't realize they were dead the whole time?
Right.  Didn't feel tacked on or out of place.
Which is nice to see.  Way too many twist endings have a twist just for the sake of it.
This one made complete sense and fit in with the scope of the film.
Completely agree.  Was very well done by the filmmaker.
