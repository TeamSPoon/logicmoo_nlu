hi mate...how's the evening going?
not bad, though quite boring, Ann has gone to visit her parent's for the weekend.
oh i see, you should knock yourself out with some great movies then ,lolz
hmm didn't really thought of that, any blockbuster movies you'd suggest i start with this evening? haven't been keeping up of late with new releases.
couple of movies out now that are great, you should check netflix, they've got "space between us" and "sleepless"  starring jamie foxx
oh sleepless i have seen the trailer plus the reviews was bad, some one even said its like the biggest flop of 2017.
on the contrary i 've seen the full movies and it's quite intriguing, i wonder why the bad reviews, I've seen them also.
the trailer never even got me interested to watch, kinda boring.
if "sleepless" is boring i wonder what you'd say about "collide"
hahaha that's is the worse of all, Ann made me waste my money on that movie just because she loves Stacy graff, but after the movie she also complain it was waste of money.
would also add  ''Diary of a Wimpy Kid'' and ''Baywatch'' on the list of flop movies.... They both bombed pretty bad.
hahaha i saw the trailer for "Baywatch" and like "sleepless" i just skipped.
what makes a great movie for you then?
well it has to be action packed and well thought through story line, sometimes stars starring can lure me to watch.... like i can't see Will Smith on a movie and i don't watch.
talking about Will smith, he's having a new movie out this year were he would be playing Mohammed Ali.
are you serious?
yeah saw it on the box office weekly magazine.
hmm i would watch out for it then
so for now what would you rather watch on netfix?
well let me browse through their recently added and see if any tickle my fancy to while away the night with.lol
