Have you been keeping up with the NFL draft?
I have. I'm really excited for next season.
I have been thinking a lot about defenses coming into this season.
There have been a lot of good defensive picks drafted in.
Who do you think has the strongest defense for the coming season?
I personally think the Denver Broncos have a phenomenal lineup.
You're not wrong there. They are definitely top three.
Who do you think has them beat?
In terms of defense I would say the Seattle Seahawks.
That's true. The Seahawks defense is looking insane again.
Yeah, it's been nothing new for them to dominate defensively.
I have to say the Texans are looking really strong defensively, too.
True, their defense might even be ahead of the Broncos.
I would say so too.
Wasn't there some talk of the Richard Sherman being up for trade in the offseason?
Yeah. I forgot about that.
He plays a huge role in defense for the Seahawks.
Yeah, I don't think they would do half as well without him.
Still, I don't see the team moving him after the draft.
That's true. I think it's safe to say he'll be staying a Seahawk in the upcoming season.
