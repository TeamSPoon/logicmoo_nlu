Lady Gaga's new song Perfect Illusion just came on the radio again on the way home.
I finally heard it!
Isn't it great?
I love the intro. It almost has an Eighties feel to me, but then it gets really hard.
Yeah. I like that it's a little poppy, but kind of angry.
The lyrics are perfection.
I really like the lines, "That's what it means to crush, now that I'm waking up..."
Yeah. It fits that moment when you realize the person you loved wasn't real.
I love that her lyrics feel so real and raw.
Yeah. It's a great, empowering, break up song.
