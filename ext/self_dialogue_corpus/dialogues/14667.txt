I haven't doen any dribbling in forever.
I'm not good at it.
Neither am I apparently but we need to practice for this charity game.
Yes, I know. I don't know why I signed up, though, because I'm not the best basketball player on earth.
I think we're both pretty mediocre but they really needed teams.
It's for a good cause at least.
Yes, it is.
Are you any good at baskets at least?
Better than I am at dribbling.
Ryan's a really good player. He's on our team at least.
I don't even care who wins anyway.
Neither do I. I just want to earn money for the kids.
That's why I signed up.
Here, try it like this.
Hey, I just dribbled for a whole thirty seconds. That's pretty cool.
You're getting better.
Looks like you are too.
A bit.
This is a pretty good work out as well.
I agree. My muscles are telling me so.
