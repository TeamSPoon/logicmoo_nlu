So, what do you think about Adele's music?
I love it.  To me it seems so different.
And she's only 29 years old.
True!  Just look at all the awards she's already won.
I wonder where she keeps them all?
No telling.  I hear some people keep their awards in the strangest places.
I would have them in the room with all of my musical stuff.
Or maybe you could keep them in a shelf in the living room.  I wonder if that's what she does?
What's your favorite Adele song?
Rolling in the deep.  It has such an awesome sound.
I like Rumor Has it.  That beat is so infectious!
It sure is.  I had forgotten about that one.
Do you think she'll have a new album out this year?
Could be.  I hope it has a name this time.
Instead of a number?  Could be nice.
Numbers are nice and all, but I would like to see a creative name.
Did you see Adele that time she was playing a joke on the Ellen Show?
I did.  Who knew she liked playing jokes on people!
It was really cool  Talented and funny lady.
Yes.  She should take advantage of that in her next album.
