Which LA Team are you rooting for this upcoming NFL season?
Chargers. The Rams are done.
Chargers are AFL.
That was back in 1970. They've been NFL since.
Woa. I guess the Rams better get their act together.
Coach Fisher got axed last season. That should help.
Who is the Chargers' coach.
The Chargers coach is Anthony Lynn. He used to play in the American League and he doesn't mess around.
Which stadium are they going to play at?
Well, first off, the Chargers only have a 1 year approval to relocate. They are required to negotiate with the Rams on a new stadium.
Well, the Rams aren't going anywhere then.
They're supposed to be joining the Rams at the new Inglewood Stadium.
I think an inter-conference game -- Chargers against the Raiders would be awesome.
Not so fast, the move has some restrictions. The Chargers won't be able to play road games against the Broncos or the Raiders.
What?!??!
Now the Chargers are considered beneficiaries of league scheduling policy. Rules are rules.
Well, the Rams better get their stuff together for sure.
The Chargers have better fans. They have their own mobile app that streams their games.
They could very well take over LA.
Well, the Raiders filed paperwork to move to LA too, can you imagine having 2 NFL teams and 1 AFL team in Los Angeles?
