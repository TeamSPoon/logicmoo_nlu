Are you going to the Phillies versus Nationals game on Saturday?
Yes, they were rained out last night but tonight, Nick Pivetta who is a young prospect is starting the game for the Phillies.
I like the Nationals, I used to like the Phillies, but I like to cheer for a winner.
Remember when the Nationals park was named Citizens Park South because the Phillies beat up on them so much?
Things change in baseball.    The Nationals are the best team in the majors.
Bryce Harper is an amazing player but Jayson Werth used to be a Philly and I do hate him.
Mike Trout was born in Millville, NJ.  It is a shame that he was not drafted  by one of his home town teams.
Trout is amazing, I met him during a game when his Angels were playing the Yankees.  He is such a down to Earth player.
Are the Angels any good?
The Angels are okay but Mike Trout is the star who never seems to have a complete team behind him.
Did you watch the World Baseball Classic this year
I loved watching America win the gold in the challenge.  I loved Marcos stroman for being the mVP.
I loved Stromun too, I do find it annoying that he plays for the Blue Jays which is a team I hate.
I like the Texas Rangers as well and we had been eliminted by the Blue Jays two seasons in a row.
How about the CUbs?
Madden who is the manager is from the town close to mine, Hazleton.
A local guy just helped the Cubs break a long and painful curse.
The GM of the Cubs also helped the Boston Red Sox beat their curse.
Theo Epstein should be in the hall of fame already the cubs and red sox
Oh well, the Phillies just lost in the 9thi inning
