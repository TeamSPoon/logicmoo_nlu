Hey!  How have you been?
I've been great.  I just got a new car actually!
Really?  Do you like it so far?
I love it.  It has sirius xm radio which I have been listening to a lot lately.
What kind of stations are available?
Every type of genre of music you might want to listen to is available on there.
Which station is your favorite?
I really like the station that plays pop music from the 1990's.
I would really enjoy listening to that too.
It brings me back to my teenage years and what I used to listen to on the radio.
I'm sure it is fun to listen to all those old songs.
It is.  Of course, they have stations with newer songs on there as well.  I listen to those too.
What else is on there?
There are quite a few country stations that I flip through.
I love country music.
Me too.  I love to listen to all those stations.
Who is your favorite country artist?
I really like to listen to Luke Bryan.
Me too.  It was great talking to you.
Good bye!
