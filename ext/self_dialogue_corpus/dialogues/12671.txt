Have you seen the newest Star Wars movie?
You mean the Force Awakens? Yes I have
No, I mean Rogue One, the spin-off movie
I haven't even heard of it before now. What is it about?
It's about the group of rebels who steal the plans for the Death Star
Oh, is it any good?
Yeah, I really enjoyed it even though it's almost entirely new characters to the series
Who else is in it from the other films?
Bail Organa is in it briefly, and so is Mon Mothma when she's younger, but that's about it
Sounds interesting. I was always curious what happened before the beginning of A New Hope, so I'll check it out
