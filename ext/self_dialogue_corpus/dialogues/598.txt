The NFL is a very unique sports organization.
Why is that?
The way money works is different in the NFL
What do you mean?
The NBA and MLB, and other sports organizations have strict rules and guidelines.
That sounds obvious doesn't the NFL have that?
Actually. All of the NFL decisions are made by a board of trustees, and all money in the NFL goes to preserving this organization.
So it's like a private company in a sense.
Exactly.
So how does that make the NFL different from a viewer standpoint?
Not sure. I bet the commercials and major decisions are decided by the board
I wonder what that does to the company.
Since everything is discussed in the board room, the vision of the company is probably always prioritized.
So football is the socialist guy among other pro sports.
Haha you could say that.
The NFL is probably a pretty rich comapny.
They'll do anything to prevent being taken down.
This kind of makes me not want to watch football anymore.
You should look into the NFL more. Check out this website.
Interesting.
