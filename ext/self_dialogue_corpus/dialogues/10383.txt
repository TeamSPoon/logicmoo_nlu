Did you see that Train is coming to Jiffy Lube Live?
Do you like them?
They're okay. The tickets are discounted... only $15.
For lawn seats?
Yeah. Normally $25.
What songs do they do? I know I should know them but nothing is coming to mind.
Drops of Jupiter was HUGE years ago.
Yeah, I think I remember that.
It was everywhere. Unavoidable!
Yeah, that's an okay song.
I kind of like "Hey Soul Sister", too.
That's fun to dance to.
Exactly.
I could see them. Especially at that price, it could be fun.
That's my thinking.
When is it?
Next Saturday.
Yeah, let's do it. Want to grab some dinner first?
Sure! How about we meet at your place since it's on the way.
Works for me!
