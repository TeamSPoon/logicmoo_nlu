What do you think of all these Spiderman remakes?
Like the upcoming "Homecoming"?
Yes. There are so many.
I think the studio just keeps milking them.
I think it is because they keep getting it wrong. Each film just goes further from the comics.
The new one is more like the comics, the whole kid super hero.
Do you think he will play a large part in the Avengers?
I think he will. Chris Evans is set to stop playing Captain America soon, they will need an all American wholesome guy.
Is Spiderman wholesome?
He always does the right thing. Grew up in New York, like the Captain.
