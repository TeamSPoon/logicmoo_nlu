Did you hear they are coming out with a sequel to Super Troopers?
No, when did that happen???
They raised funds for it last year.
When is it coming out?
It was supposed to be in production last year but there is no release date.
I can't wait for it!
I know, I hope it will be as good at the first!
That is the problem with sequels.
I know right, kind of like Anchorman 2.
Yeah, that one was a bomb, I don't know how they messed that up so bad.
Well hopefully the super troopers sequel will be better
Do you know what the premise is?
I heard it was supposed to take place in the 70s but then read that it actually framed a few months after the original.
Did they get all the same actors?
I think so
Even Farva?
Yes, Farva is definitely in it, he was in the crowd funding video they produced.
Did he want a liter cola
Of course he did.
I don't want a large Farva, I want a GD litercola!
