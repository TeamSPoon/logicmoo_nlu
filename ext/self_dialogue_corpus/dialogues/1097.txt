Are you a fan of the Philadelphia Eagles?
Absolutely. Lived in Philly for some of my childhood.
Right in Philly?
Well, in the suburbs. Valley Forge.
I hear Eagle fans are ruthless.
Yeah, we once booed a guy dressed as Santa during a game.
Have the Eagles ever won a Super Bowl?
No, but they won some NFL championships prior to the Super Bowl.
What years?
I don't recall the exact years. Sometime way back in the 40s and 60s.
Oh so it's been awhile since they've won something.
Yeah, we made the Super Bowl in 2004, but lost.
Who won that year?
The Patriots. One of their first wins. It was horrible.
Was it a close game?
Yes, lost by 3.
Oh man, that must've been devastating to watch.
It was. Still gives me nightmares.
Well there's always hope every year.
Yes there is.
