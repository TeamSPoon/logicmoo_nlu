Were you ever a fan of R Kelly?
I think so, can you remind me of some of his songs?
Well one of my the best in my opinion was "Bump and Grind".
Oh yes! I loved that one.
Right? Reminds me of high school days when we would have dancing parties.
Yes those were good times.
Didn't have sing a song that was featured on Space Jam?
I think you're right but which one?
The song was titled "I Believe I Can Fly".
"I believe I can touch the sky! Think about it every night and day....."
"Spread my wings and fly away..."
Yes that was a classic.
I would sing that and then jump off my bed. It was silly.
I had a friend in high school who sang that song real well.
It's a beautiful song. Has a lot of meaning.
It really does. I heard it at a funeral.
I know. We played it at my aunt's funeral.
Wasn't R Kelly charged as a pedophile?
I think you may be right. I don't remember the details though.
I don't know all of them either actually, just that he was arrested for having sex with an underage girl.
