Did you see the Reds-Giants game last night?
No, what happened?
It went 17 innings.
Who won?
The Giants. Posey hit a HR in the 17th to win it.
He was still in the game?
yeah, imagine playing 17 innings at catcher.
How long did it last
It must have been over 5 hours at least
That's the toughest position, and he played it for 5 hours.
There's no way he's playing today.
No way, they're giving him a day off.
How did Billy Hamilton look last night?
0 for 7.
That's not good. So no stolen bases?
No, none.
He hasn't had a stolen base in more than a week.
I know. He was on pace for 100+ this year.
He'll probably get injured before he can get close
Happens every year.
