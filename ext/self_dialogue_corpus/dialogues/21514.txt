Hey, I need help finding a movie but I can't remember the title for the life of me.
Okay. Do you remember what it was about?
Well, there were twos guys in it who wanted to be spies.
Who were the actors in the movie?
I don't remember their names but I'd recognize them if I saw them.
Go on.
Like I sad, the two guys wanted to be spies, but they were complete idiots.
That could be any Jim Carey movie.
I'm pretty sure Carey wasn't in it. I'd remember that much.
It doesn't sound like something I've seen so.
The two guys don't know that they're brothers at first.
Brothers Grimsby.
No, because from that movie you knew their were brothers all along and one was already a trained spy.
I'm drawing a blank. Was it a comedy?
The movie had a bunch of crude humor it, so yes.
Spies Like Us.
No, it's not that one either.
Well, I have no idea what it is. It would be helpful if you could remember some of the actors in it.
I know. I haven't seen the movie in a while and I think I only watched it once with a friend.
I think you should try searching the internet for it. It knows all.
