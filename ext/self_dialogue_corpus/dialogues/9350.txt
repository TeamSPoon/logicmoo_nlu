Which do you think was better? Illmatic or Reasonable Doubt?
Reasonable Doubt, of course.
You didn't like the classic Illmatic? With the beats by Premier and everyone?
Not saying that I didn't like Illmatic, but Jay's delivery on Reasonable Doubt was timeless.
Okay, so what exactly made Reasonable Doubt so good to you?
I loved the innocence of Jay-Z and how his perspective was so young and hungry.
I can definitely feel that, especially on Can I Live and Regrets.
Also, Dead Presidents, Brooklyn's Finest, so many tracks.
Illmatic had fire too. But I can see more consistency with Reasonable Doubt now that you say that.
Yes, that's exactly what Reasonable Doubt had: consistency.
