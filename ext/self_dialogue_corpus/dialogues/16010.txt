I'm having a terrible time with the Debussy piece.
Which one are you working on?
Estampes
Oh my gosh. The whole work?
I'm just focusing on Jardins sous la pluie right now
That's a tough one. What are you struggling with?
The cross-overs, especially. My fingers get all tangled up.
Have you tried working hands separately?
Yeah. I'm fine with each alone. It's putting them together that's the challenge.
Hrm. What about altering the rhythms to get your hands coordinated?
That's a good idea! I haven't tried that yet.
I just love that lyrical part in the middle. It really does sound like little raindrops.
Oh I know! Well, it does when I play it right!
When I was working on that piece, that was my breathing spot.
How long ago did you study this one?
It's been probably 15 years.
I'd love to hear you play it.
Hah, I'd have to woodshed a bit. I haven't played that one in ages.
So maybe I could give YOU some tips on how to practice it!
I bet you could, now!
