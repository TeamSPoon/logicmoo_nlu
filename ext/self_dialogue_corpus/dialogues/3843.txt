Do you believe there are still people that haven't seen the movie Jaws?
I know,I know a couple.
One of the best thrillers ever.
I agree. Made me afraid to go in the ocean.
It made a lot of people afraid.
Steven Spielberg write some great stuff.
Yea,he's the best.
Robert Shaw played Quint. He was great.
Of course so was Richard Dreyfuss.
Roy Schneider was my favorite.
