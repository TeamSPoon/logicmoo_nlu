Oh man, did you see "The Witch"? I loved it.
Really? I didn't understand it.
Well, it was about a witch coven.
No it wasn't. It was about a rather silly girl who let her brother get kidnapped.
Alright, so it doesn't have much of a plot. It's all about mood. And there's more going on than you think.
Like what?
The movie is about Puritan attitudes toward nature and the devil. Puritans thought that disorder was reflective of the devil and nature was the devil's realm.
So that's why all shots of the woods were dark and freaky?
Exactly. The border of the family's land was godly; everything beyond it was evil.
So, what about the boy?
The boy was an example of what happens if people aren't vigilant against evil.
Didn't he get eaten by a wolf or something?
Not really. The girl was straying from God's path and let evil into the sanctity of the family plot of land and the boy paid for that.
You're boring me. Have you seen "Captain Underpants"? That was fantastic. Never have I laughed so hard.
You're comparing "The Witch" to "Captain Underpants"?
Sure: "The Witch" is artsy-fartsy crap and "Captain Underpants" is good old-fashioned fun.
Don't you get tired of fart jokes?
Never. And some of them were strangely sophisticated.
I was afraid he was going to drop his underpants.
That's the adult version. It comes out next year and stars Jack Black in all his undisguised glory.
