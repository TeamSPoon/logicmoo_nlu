I'm having a Disney movie marathon!
That's awesome. I love Disney movies!
Me too. They make me feel relaxed and happy.
So which one are you watching now?
Aladdin!
Awesome. I love Pocohontas. Have you watched that one yet?
Yes! That was the first one I watched. It's my favorite.
Mine too. What's your favorite song from it?
I like when she sings The Colors of the Wind.
That song is beautiful.
