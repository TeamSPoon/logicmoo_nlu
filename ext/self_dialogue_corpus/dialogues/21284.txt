What do you think the best Disney movie is?
I liked The Hunchback of Notre Dame.
The musical variant they made? But it had nothing to do with the book.
What do you mean?
Disney's version of the Hunchback of Notre Dame had nothing to do with the book; the book was much darker.
Right... but it's a kid's movie. Of course it's going to be a bit gentle.
I suppose, but they changed everything.
How so?
Frollo wasn the Archdeacon of Notre Dame, not a court judge as the Disney movie suggested.
Wait, really?
Yes.
Oh... I had no idea.
Not only that, but Quasimodo murders Frollo in the book.
Wait. What? He doesn't try to save him?
No. He murders Frollo right at the end. The movie does something different, I believe.
No, you're right. In the movie Frollo dies, but Quasimodo does everything he can to try to save him.
Ah, well. That's fine I guess. my favorite Disney movie is Mulan.
... Mulan? And you're complaining about accuracy?
What do you mean?
Mulan has nothing to do with the actual story of Mulan...
