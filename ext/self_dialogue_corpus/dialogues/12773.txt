What do you think about the new sith, Kylo Ren; in the new Star War's episode?
This is the one who is taking Darth Vader's place?
Yes, apparently Darth Vader, who ended up being Luke Skywalker's father has a following.
That's right I heard that Kylo Ren is Darth Vader's grandson in the Force Awakens.
Yes, he is the son of Han Solo, and Leia Organa.
So do you think Kylo Ren will eventually turn to the light side?
I am not to sure, the movie get's pretty dark near the end.
Does it get as dark as Episode 3 when the young jedi's are killed?
Yes, there is always something that keeps the sith going down the dark path.
I am glad that they have a new jedi to battle him, hopefully Luke take care of the sith for good.
