Everything new on the radio today is bad.
Yeah, I can't stand most of the new stuff.
The only group I like is Imagine Dragons.
Yeah, me too - I wish they were played more.  I like the band Fun too.
Yes, they are similar and both good, but too much time goes to pop music on the stations that play them.
Agree,  I miss some of the classic ballad / big hair bands!
That time was so much fun,..listening to bands like REO Speedwagon.
Exactly - i still sing along with "I Can't Fight This Feeling" haha.
Me too. Any of their stuff is great, and having a hits album makes it easy to find what I like.
I loved Boston and Rush too - so many great albums and songs!
Yes, when I was in college I loved Boston and didn't like the Eagles then totally got hooked on the Eagles.
I remember being so sad when the Eagles broke up.  Loved their music.
Yeah, we I was travelling in Europe in the late 1980s everyone LOVED the Eagles.
Really?  I didn't know they were popular over there.
We used to play our Eagles cassette tapes and the Germans loved it.
That's really cool.  I wonder what they think of American music now!
Can you imagine what they think of Justin Bieber?  They probably roll their eyes.
Of course the Germans have some interesting much too.  Think about Ramstein.
Or polka haha - quite a variety. All the hard metal rock too.
I'd be interested in trying some of that out.  Any suggestions?
