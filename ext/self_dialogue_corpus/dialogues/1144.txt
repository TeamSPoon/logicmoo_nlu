Who do you think is the greatest quarterback in Philadelphia Eagles history?
Well I am too young to remember Normal Van Brocklin people say he was good for the time.
If we go by Super Bowls I guess you might say Ron Jaworski.
Well, he didn't win the Superbowl, Donovan McNabb appeared in one too.
The Eagles didn't have any one super quarterback like a Tom Brady or Peyton Manning.
No, I think McNabb has to be a contender though.
He was the quarterback over a number of good years.
They have had many short term solutions.
Like Michael Vick, Bobby Hoying, Rodney Peete, Nick Foles, Sam Bradford?
Yes, those are some of the guys in revolving quarterbacks.
Randall Cunningham was another one who played for a while.
I agree it comes down to those three for at least the time I have been alive.
It's either Jaworski, Cunningham, or McNabb.
I'd say I'd have to go with McNabb at this point.
He had his flaws but the best on the list.
Maybe Carson Wentz will be on the list someday.
Hopefully he will be like a Brady.
One can only dream.
We will see how it plays out will know a lot more after this upcoming year.
Time to be optimistic.
