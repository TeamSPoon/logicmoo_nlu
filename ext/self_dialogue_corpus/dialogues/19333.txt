What kind of music do you like?
Anything really, just not rap or screaming metal.
How about Classic Rock?
Sure, I listen to that often.
What's your favorite bands to listen to?
I love Eagles, Boston, Aerosmith.  You know, stuff from the late 70's and early 80s.
Do you like any of the old 70s folk music?
Like what?
I really enjoy listening to James Taylor or Simon and Garfunkel.
Ahhh, you like that mellow stuff.
Well, really it all depends on my mood or what I'm doing.
I understand.  It's the same for me.
What do you listen to when you are trying to concentrate?
Usually classical, which is odd because I also listen to classical when I go to bed.
How about when you are cleaning the house.
Well it all depends how I am feeling.  I use spotify and just pick the folder Im in the mood for.  How about you?
I usually listen to country music when I'm cleaning.
For me, I just want to listen to music I can sing along to.  Usually when I'm cleaning, no one is home so I can sing as loud as I want.
I would frighten my dogs if I did that.
Good thing I don't have pets!  They don't have to hear it.
