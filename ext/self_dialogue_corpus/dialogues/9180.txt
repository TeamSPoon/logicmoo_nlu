Do you know of an album called "Rock Is Deadâ€”Long Live Rock" by The Who?
Yes, I've heard of it. It was not formally released.
Yet, it poses an interesting question. One that's still pertinent today.
I'm not sure I'm following you. What's the question, exactly?
Is rock music dead or alive?
It's alive!
Why do you think so?
I don't think you can kill anything these days.
What do you mean?
With all theses social media outlets, it's easy to bring people together on any topic. So, there will always be fans of rock music!
