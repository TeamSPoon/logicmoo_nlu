What song are you listening to?
I am currently listening to the new Drake single.
That sounds really good. Do you like it?
I do, but not as much as his other old songs.
I always feel that way about artists who are older.
Are you referring to an artist like Kanye West?
Yes that is actually the artist that I am referring to.
I would have to agree. You just get used to a certain kind of music.
Yes that is exactly my point.
I also like to see an artist evolve.
I suppose you are right. Where would we be without evolution?
I still do like to listen to older Drake songs such as So Far Gone.
I just feel if I wanted to hear something different I would just listen to a different artist.
That does make a lot of sense. I do sometimes as well.
What is your all-time favorite Drake song?
I really love Hotline Bling!
Do you like that more than One Dance?
That is a very hard choice.
I think I would pick One Dance out of those two.
I still think I am going to go with the option Hotline Bling.
