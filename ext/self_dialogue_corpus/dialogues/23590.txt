Do you like Patty Jenkins films?
I am not sure, what did she do?
Well, she just did Wonderwoman.
I love that show!
It is amazing. She also did some more dramatic films. Like Monster.
I am not sure I know that one.
The one with Charlize Theron, but she is all done up to look kind of creepy.
Oh, I seen that one,it was a great film.
She did one called Five too, very in depth and drama filled.
I loved that one too. Moving film.
She really does a good job directing films. The superhero genre is pretty new to her.
She did it well though. The pacing in that film is amazing.
I think her pacing in films is always great.
Monster, yeah it really told a story.
That movie really draws you in.
Captivates your emotions. I like films like that.
The drama filled ones?
Yes, the drama, but something more too. Maybe something moving.
Something that some how tells a story. I like films that have a different way of telling a story.
I do too, ones that make you think and feel.
