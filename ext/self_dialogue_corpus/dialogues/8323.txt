I listened to the new Starley song and really liked it, did you hear it yet?
I'm not sure, which one?
It is called Call on me.
What kind of song is it?
It is calming yet happy and energizing a bit.
Interesting, is it a happy song?
Well there are some sad words but it is mostly positive.
That sounds like life itself.
Yes the song does mirror life like that.
I will listen to it soon, thanks for mentioning it.
