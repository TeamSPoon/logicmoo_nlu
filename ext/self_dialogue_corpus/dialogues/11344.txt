I may get some flack for saying this, but I think the Beatles are overrated.
How could you even think that?
Maybe it is because I am younger and I wasn't alive when they were at their height.  I don't know.
What is your criticism of them?
Well, I think they did make decent songs.  I guess I like my bands with a little more edge to them.
I think the Beatles were masters of taking a song that sounds clean on the surface, but it had some crazy alternative meaning.
I may have to dig deeper into their catalog.
Have you heard of the song "Helter Skelter"?
Yes, that is probably my favorite Beatles song.  It reminds me of something the Rolling Stones would do.
It sounds like you enjoy the more straightforward rock and roll songs.  That may be why you don't like some of The Beatles' work.
