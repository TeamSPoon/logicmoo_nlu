Who would you say is the most influential rapper
In my opinion, it has to be Eminem
Really? Why him?
Well he broke so many boundries in his day
What does that have to do with his music though?
Well all of his struggles really show through in his flow and his lyrics
Yeah that makes sense. Can you recommend me an Eminem song?
White America has a pretty deep meaning
Wow i'll have a listen
Trust me, you'll be blown away by his flow
