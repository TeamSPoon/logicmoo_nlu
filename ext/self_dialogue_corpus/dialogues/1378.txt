Football please combe back on TV!
I know, it's been boring just watching baseball.
Before we know it football wil be on Thursday, Sunday and Monday night.
Thursday games are usually pretty boring but I watch them.
Yes it's usually teams like Cleveland or Jacksonville.
Maybe they are trying to get more exposure.
I'm not sure how those games are assigned, but it is a spot light for two teams.
Monday night football is my favorite.
I'd have to say Sunday night is mine. I like the NBC guys better.
John Gruden is my favorites so I lean towards Monday night football.
Well I hope both night have some good matchups.
They usually have some good divisional games likes Dalls versus Washington.
Do you like the Cowboys?
I do now.  Their team is fun to watch.
I like to watch the Saints throw a lot of passes.
Drew Brees can air it out!
Passing is the way of the NFL now.
For sure, but some teams have decent running backs.
You have to have a good running back to throw off defenses or they wil just drop back in coverage.
Thats why I'm liking the Cowboys lately.  Elliot is fun to watch.
