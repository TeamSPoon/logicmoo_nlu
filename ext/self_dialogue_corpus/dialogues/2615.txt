Who do you like to go to the SUPERBOWL this year.
New England is certainly going to be a big favorite.
They're a big favorite every year.
No matter what players they lose is pickup.
They find a way to win.
It's a top notch organization.
Yes it is.
Do you think Atlanta will make it again?
I don't know. Sometimes you only get one shot.
They certainly blew their shot last year.
Hard to believe they lost that game.
Some people think the raiders have a shot.
They could be really good.
If Derek Carr comes back healthy they'll be good.
How about Pittsburgh making a run.
They're offense can be scary good.
If their defense takes it up a notch they can be in the mix.
Yes they can.
Big Ben tends to get hurt a lot.
Yes,his style of play is why.
