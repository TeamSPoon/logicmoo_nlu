Have you ever heard of Blink 182?
Yes, wow it's been years since I've heard their songs.
Yeah, I love Mark Hoppus! His voice is awesome!
Yes it is! The drum player is great too!
I agree! Travis Barker can really play those drums.
Do you know where they formed the band?
Yes, in Poway, California!
Wow? Really? An American band!
They started back in 1992. I use to listen to them all the time.
Me too! They were actually just called "Blink" at first but some Irish band wanted to take them to court so they added the numbers.
Wow! I didn't know that.
Travis Barker has been married a few times.
I am sure he has! What a cutie! He married a Miss USA model!
Her name is Shanna Moakler. They got divorced later on.
That's sad. Celebrities never stay married!
Right! That is sad.
We should go to their concert!
That's a great idea. When do they tour?
They are on tour right now!
Let's check the dates and locations!
