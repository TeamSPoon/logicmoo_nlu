Have you ever seen the movie Mean Girls?
No, doesn't that have Lindsay Lohan in it?
Yes it does, it also has Rachel McAdams in it and the girl who was in Dear John.
Oh was it Amanda Seyfried? She's gorgeous. Isn't that a chick-flick though?
It is, but it's pretty popular. It's one of the top most quotable movies of all time.
What's it about?
Well basically it's about mean girls in high school based on popularity.
That reminds me of my high school days, not fun.
Yeah it's kind of like real life. The main character, Lindsay, Cady in the movie, befriends a girl and gay guy and they plan to kind of destroy the girls' popularity by showing everyone who they really are.
That's a little vicious, but I guess since the mean girls are doing the bullying first.
That's how it is, but in the midst of it all Cady ends up being one of the popular girls and turning on her new friends. Oh and Cady had just moved there from Africa and is considered pretty hot.
No wonder she became popular, it probably got to her head too.
Yeah, it really did. Then she makes out with the main girl's ex-boyfriend!
Oh wow!
Yeah! but the girl was cheating on him anyway.
So it sounds like there's some drama involved.
Oh, for sure. It should be right up your alley!
Very funny! How many times have you seen it?
Too many...or maybe not enough.
Let's watch it together then!
