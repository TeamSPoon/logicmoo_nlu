I can't believe they are making another Toy Story!
I am a little worried about it.  I thought the third one was perfect.
The third one made me cry!  I thought it wrapped up the movies perfectly.
I'm not sure how they are going to do the voices for all of the characters since some of the voice actors have passed away.
I didn't know that.  Which characters have passed away?
I'm pretty sure the voice for slinky dog and maybe Hamm.
Those are pretty big characters.  It will be interested to see what they do with them.
I wonder what they plot line will be, since Andy gave the toys away.
Maybe it will start with the little girl being older again.
Maybe it will be some kind of flashback movie.
