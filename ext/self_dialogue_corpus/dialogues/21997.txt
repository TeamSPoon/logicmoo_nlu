Hey, did you know that they have a sequel to Finding Nemo?
No, are you serious?  How did I miss that?
I don't know, it's been advertised everywhere.
So what's it called?
It's called Finding Dory and it features Dory, the fish from Nemo!
Oh are you serious!  That's precious!
Yeah, it's a total must see.  I wouldn't say it's quite as good as the original, but it's definitely close.
So what is the storyline?
Well, Dory is looking for her family in the movie.  She has lost them and she wants to reconnect.
Is it chronologically taking place after the Nemo movie?
Yes it is.  So she enlists the help of Nemo and others to find her family.
That sounds so sweet!  Is it as funny as the original?
Yeah, I'd say it's nearly as funny and definitely just as heartwarming.
I'm going to have to check that out.  I thought Finding Nemo was amazing.
Yeah it truly was amazing, and it was made over ten years ago!  It took them forever to make a sequel.
Well I wouldn't have expected a sequel to that movie.
No, I was surprised too.  It was a pleasant surprise though.
Well I will definitely check it out.  Is Nemo's dad in it too?
Oh definitely, it has his dad and there are a bunch of funny new characters too like this octopus you'll really like.
That sounds great.  I can't wait to see it!
