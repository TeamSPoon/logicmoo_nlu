Do you prefer watching movies or listening to music?
Oh, I definitely prefer watching movies. I have a big collection at home.
What's your favorite?
Any classic comedy, but my all-time favorite is Little Shop of Horrors.
Is that the movie with the talking plant?
Yes! I love the musical version, but also the older one.
There's another version aside from the one with Rick Moranis?
Indeed, it was originally a black and white pulpy horror film from the early 1960s.
I didn't know that! Who directed it?
It was directed by Roger Corman. He's somewhat a cult figure in the world of B-movies.
I've seen the musical version and liked it. Reminds me of Labyrinth.
I love Labyrinth! Bowie was brilliant in it.
I agree. Who played that girl, though?
That girl was a young Jennifer Connelly.
She did a great job in that film.
She really did, but Jim Henson's puppets really stole the show.
I saw Labyrinth in the theatres recently.
Really? But it came out in the 1980s!
They did a double feature with Dark Crystal.
That sounds like it must have been a really wild night!
