Man i really can't wait for Denzel Curry to drop Taboo.
Yeah, I really feel like Curry has a 10/10 album in him. He's got talent.
Judging from the demos he's put out, it wouldn't be a stretch to say that Taboo could fit that bill.
They're all so good and what is most impressive to me, is he's managed to maintain a fresh sound.
He's come such a long way from Nostalgic 64.
Did you know began rapping in the sixth grade?
No, I had no idea. Wow, that's young.
Well, he was only 16 when he released his first mixtape.
I know he joined Raider Klan when he was young, I didn't know he was that young.
He's definitely going to go far in the rap world. He's so talented.
