What did you think of the last Captain America movie?
I thought it was a lot better than I anticipated it would be.
Yea I really liked it. It had so many characters in it!
Yea, they are really ramping it up. The next one will probably be the last.
Oh that's too bad. Captain America is a really cool character.
They make him way too strong in the movie though.
I think he is supposed to be that strong, he's captain America!
No, he shouldn't be able to fight Iron Man like that.
Oh yea, I guess that's true.
Oh well, they still did a great job with the movie.
