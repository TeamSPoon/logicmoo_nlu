What are you listening to?
I'm testing out toddler stations for my two-year old!
Awwww! How cute!
Yah.  I'm currently on Kazoo Baby Soup station.
What's it sound like?
Cute toddler tunes that sound like nursery rhymes.
Does it have a modern sound though?
Yes, it's all created in 2017.
What songs do you like for little Zoey Lauren?
I like Popsicle Parade, Baby ChillOut, and Travel Pizza.
Cute names!  What's Travel Pizza?
It's a three part song that is good while traveling or driving with toddlers.
What's it about?
Naming objects outside the window, eating yummy snacks and finally falling asleep.
Does it work?
Every time!
Those stations sound awesome.
They are, especially for road trips.
Can she sing along?
Yes, she always does.
