You know how at the end of each Super Bowl the MVP looks at the camera and says "I'm going to Disneyland," or "I'm going to Disney World?"
I'm very familiar with that.
Do you know how that got stated?
It got started back in 1987 when Michael Eisner was the CEO of Disney.
So he started it?
Actually, his wife came up with the idea.
How was that?
They were out to dinner with friends and one of the friends was asked what they were going to do next and they answered by saying, "I'm going to Disneyland."
So his wife thought it would be a good slogan?
Exactly.
Do the players really get to go?
They do and they even get to rid in a parade.
That would be so exciting to ride in a Disney parade. Who was the first person to say this?
Phil Simms. He was the quarterback for the New York Giants.
Did he say Disneyland or Disney World.
He said Disney World.
What a fun thing to get to do once the season is over.
I would love a trip to Disney World
I guess all we have to do is become professional football players and win the Super Bowl.
Oh is that all?
