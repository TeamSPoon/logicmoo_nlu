Who is the best Disney villain?
Jeez, there are a lot of good ones.
Disney does villains well.
I like the ones you still sort of want to root for.
Like Maleficent?
In the cartoons?
No, in the animation she was just pure evil. In the live film, not so much.
I liked her in the live one.
So, who would you say then Mallificent.
I would have to go with, yes, live action Mallificent.
