Do you like The Doors?
Never heard of them.  Who are they?
They were a rock band from Los Angeles.
Sounds cool.  Are they a new band?
No, their first album was released in 1967.
Wow.  Do they still put out music?
No, unfortunately their lead singer died in 1971 and that effectively ended the band.
Oh no, so when their singer died they decided to quit?
No, they still released two more albums but they weren't successful.
They broke up after that?
Yes, they would still perform sometimes but for all intents and purposes, they were over as a band.
Sad.  What was their lead singer's name?
Jim Morrison was his name.  He's considered one of the best rock and roll frontmen of all time.
Wow.  What are some of their best songs?
There are a bunch.  Light My Fire, Hello I Love You, Break on Thru, and The End are just a few.
Wow.  I think I have heard them.  They were from LA?
Yes, Jim Morrison and Ray Manzarek (the keyboardist), met in film school at UCLA.
Cool.  What are their best albums in your opinion?
Their first and second albums are considered masterpieces.
I'll download their first album right now.  Thanks!
