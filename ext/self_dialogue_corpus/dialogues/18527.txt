Can you name me your top three favorite bands?
Wow, that is going to be really hard for me.
I know how much you love music, so I thought it would be interesting to hear your list.
I would have to start off by saying Metallica.
Are they your all time favorite?
Well they are for sure in my top three. They have put out some great music over the years.
I agree with you on that. What is your favorite song from them?
That is another really hard question for me!
I am making you really think during this conversation!
It would be between Enter Sandman and Fade to Black.
I used to love that song the Unforgiven when I was younger.
Yea that is actually a great song in its own right.
So who are your other two bands in your top three?
I would have to include Nirvana in my top three as well.
Kurt Cobain has to be considered a legend at this point.
There is no doubt about that. I wished he was still around to make music though!
Yea, that would great. What is your favorite song from Nirvana?
I would have to say Smells Like Teen Spirit.
I thought you would say that one!
For my last band I would have to say Black Sabbath, They have put out some great music in their day!
