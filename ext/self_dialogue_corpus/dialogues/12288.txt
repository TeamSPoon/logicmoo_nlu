What is a saddest part of Star Wars?
I think when Anakin is burning is a sad part
Why do you say that?
He is getting burned slowly by lava and doesn't get any help?
Who was nearby to help him?
Obi Wan was right there!
And Obi Wan didn't help him?
Not at all, he let him burn
I thought Obi Wan was good?
Yeah but Anakin was so angry that he would take every chance to hurt Obi Wan at that time
