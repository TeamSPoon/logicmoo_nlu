What do you think about Durant's move to Golden State
I think it's one of the weakest moves I have ever seen
Yeah, you know it's bad when I agree with Stephen A. Smith
My thoughts exactly. He could have went anywhere else.
And then to go to the team that you should have beaten last year!
The team that won 73 games without you!
Yeah, I don't recall a player ever doing something like that before
Me neither. I mean guys have played with other superstars, but not like this
Yeah this was a trash move and professionally I have lost some respect for him.
Yeah me too. I think this was a move just so he can say that he was a champion.
Yeah I think he was scared that he would never get a championship in his career
Yeah. Very weak on his part. He could have carved a legacy had he won with the thunder
In golden state he's just a piece of the puzzle
I definitely feel like this move is showing a character flaw for Durant
Even if he had went somewhere else, I would have been cool with it.
Yeah me too. Just not the team that didn't need you anyway
He will probably get this ring, but it will be tainted
Absolutely. Most people will not forget this.
This takes away from his legacy not add to it.
Someone should have told him that before he signed on the dotted line.
