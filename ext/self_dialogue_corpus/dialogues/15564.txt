Was you a fan of Dr. Hook and the Medicine Show in the 1980's?
Yes, I haven't thought about them for years but I remember Sylvia's Mother playing at the swimming pool all of the time.
I like the song The Cover of the Rolling Stones.
Rolling Stones, got get my picture on the cover of the Rolling Stones, yeah that was a good one.
Oh my gosh, they had so many songs, can you think of one.
Sexy Eyes and Only Sixteen those were big hits.
I loved Ray Sawyer's gravely voice. I thought he had the coolest voice.
Yeah, you always knew it was him just from his voice.
He always wore that eye patch, he was a character wasn't he.
Yes he was. I can't remember who all was in that band, can you?
I remember Dennis Locorriere he played guitar and Ray Sawyer played guitar.
Oh yeah, I just remembered George Cummings played the steel guitar.
They shortened their name in 1975 to Dr. Hook.
My brother had the Sometimes You Win album and he played it constantly.
I had the Sloppy Seconds and Pleasure and Pain albums.
Now I have that cover of the rolling stones song in my head now.
That's funny because I was thinking about it too. It is weird how that happens.
I know, I once got a song stuck in my head for three days.
Great music is impossible to not think about.
That is for sure. I'll be humming this one all day now.
