What do you think of Lady Gaga now? It seems like she's losing her edge.
I totally agree. Her first album was so amazing.
Yeah,  The Fame had some really great singles on it. I used to listen to Paparazzi all the time in the car.
Oh my god. Me too! I loved Alejandro as well. That music video was steamy!
Oh yeah, I remember it was really controversial when it came out.
Did you know she used to write for Britney Spears?
Really? I had no idea. I knew she grew up in New York.
Yeah, I knew someone that went to high school with her.
Wow, that's funny. Did they still talk?
Oh, no. They were never friends.
