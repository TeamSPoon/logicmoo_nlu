Ready to turn up
What in the world do you mean by turn up
Have fun you punk
Well yeah
I got the music picked out for the party and it is going to be a blast
Well then i am happy then i was nervoues
why were you nervous
That you were not gonna have any music picked out and were gonna make me pick some out
Nah i would not do that to you
Well i am glad i had faith then
It is good just have more faith next time
What songs are you playing for the party
I got a full playlist setup
Well what is on the play list
Some stuff like august burns red and between the buried and me
Sounds good not to heavy and friendly to people
Exactly what i thought
Do not forget the music system though
The speakers nah i wont forget
Just giving a reminder.
