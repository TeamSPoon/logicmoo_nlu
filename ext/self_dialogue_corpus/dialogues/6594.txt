Johnny Depp must really love playing Captain Jack Sparrow in The Pirates of the Caribbean movies.
Well, I'm sure he does- hit movies, more fame, more money...
No, I mean he must really enjoy the character- he turned up in April at Disneyland at the Pirates of the Caribbean ride dressed up as his character.
What was he doing there? Did Disney ask him to do a promo for the new movie or something?
No, apparently he just wanted to surprise his fans.
I bet there were some really thrilled fans at the ride when they saw him!
There were dozens of screaming fans. He was interacting with them, and quoting lines from the movies, and had his sword.
Can you imagine how shocked you would be? At first they probably thought it was just a celebrity double.
The fans were quoted as being shocked and surprised, and said he acted just like his movie character.
That would really get people excited. His character is so popular. And having him just pop up out of nowhere must have been amazing for those fans.
