How did you like Rogue One, you have seen it right?
Yes, I have and a I enjoyed it quite a bit.
What was you favorite character.
Jynn Erso, because she's kind of a croos bewteen Han Solo and Leia.
What do you mean, how is she a cross between those two?
Well, like like Leia she is a strong, confident woman, but like Han, she starts out fairly mercernary, but becomes a beleiver in the cause.
Okay, I see your point. Any of the new elements added for the film that you particularly liked.
The Death trooper, those black armored elite Stormtroopers.
Really, how come?
Because they put the threat and menace back into the Stormtrooper. I mean, after being defeated by Ewoks, did regular Stormtrooper intimidate you anymore?
