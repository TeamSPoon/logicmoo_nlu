Do you like the women's music groups from around the 80's?
I do, but I don't remember many of their names or their songs.
They are my favorite type of music to listen to.  Remember the Bangles?
I have heard of them.  What songs did they have?
They had a bunch of hits, I guess the most famous was "Walk Like an Egyptian"
Oh yeah, I remember that song from seeing the video for it oh VH1.
It's an OK song, but my favorite from them is "Manic Monday".
That's a good one too, I used to think about that song every Monday when going back to work.
I know what you mean.  I hate going back to work on Mondays, and that song sums it up nicely.
It made me just now think of Madonna.  She had some songs that kind of had the same sound.
I know what you mean.  "Into the Groove" and "Vogue" come to mind!
She had so many different types of songs.  I like the 80's pop style that went with the songs too.
Oh my, like the big hair, and the over used makeup and the gaudy jewelry??
Yes, and the colors of the outfits, and the ratty look of the clothes too.  It was way different.
Madonna was right there as a trend setter for all of that.  Remember "Like a Virgin"?
Yes, I used to get embarrassed when that would play and my mom was in the same room.
Me too, but I loved dancing to that song.
All of her songs were so good for dancing.
I know, she was probably the best woman pop musician for dancing during the 80's
I sure can't think of anyone that was better than her.  Her music always had the best beats to them!
