What's your take on the new Star Wars trailer?
Quite eerie really.
How so?
It sure seems like they are signaling that Jedis will no longer be a part of the universe.
My guess is that Luke knows you have to be on the light and dark side in order to be efficient.
That's a solid guess.  He probably realizes that to survive, one needs to be of both minds.
The poster alludes to it as well.
How so?
Check out the red and blue lightsabers meeting and joining.  I think it's foreshadowing.
Interesting idea.  Maybe you're right1
