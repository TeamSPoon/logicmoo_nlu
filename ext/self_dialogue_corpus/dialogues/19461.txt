What are you listening to this summer? I'm really enjoying Halsey's duet with that girl from Little Mix.
Lauren Jauregui? She's from Fifth Harmony.
Is there a difference?
Yes! Little Mix is from the UK.
That's not much of a difference, honestly. But I like the song with Halsey.
Halsey is fantastic. I like most of her music.
Me too, but this one especially has been playing on repeat.
So far this summer I'm loving Mary Lambert's new song.
Which one is that? The one with the arcade or whatever?
Yeah, the video is amazing, but the song is pretty fun on it's own.
I haven't seen it or heard it. I heard about it from someone though.
The song is so fun, and funny! It's about meeting someone and really liking them before you even know their name.
Cool. I want to see the video.
It's amazing! It reminds me of Bad Blood by Taylor Swift, but it's geeky.
Because they're in an arcade?
Well yeah, but they are all playing video games and competeing against this mysterious player.
That sounds pretty cool.
It is. But the song does stand for itself also.
That's good to know.
Do you want to listen to it now?
