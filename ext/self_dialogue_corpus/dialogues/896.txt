You know what;'s funny though?
What?
What's the most liberal city in the US?
San Francisco. Go 49ers!
Exactly.49ers didn't have a starting black QB until Troy Smith in 2010.
No way, that's insane. In the city known for its insane liberalism, they didn't even have a black QB until 2010....
That's not even the worst of it.
What do you mean?
The Pariots didn't have any black starting QB until Jacoby brissett in 2016.
Oh and that was for the Brady's suspension.
Yep. Started 2 games, and went inactive again when Brady came back
All these bad storuies don't make me feel good
Well, there are the good ones though
Like who, wait, Cam Newton's pretty good
Russell Wilson, Tyrod Taylor, jaemis Winston, and Dak prescott
Oh, I liek Dak Prescorr, he's gonna be big
Yeah, anyway ther's only one team left who hasn't started a balck QB in their history./
Who?
NY Giants. They srated in 1925, and has never had a black QB start a game.
Well, for whatever it's worth, Eli Manning has the NFL's longest streak in starting. he's never missed a start since 2004.
