Ever heard of Cage the Elephant?
The band out of Kentucky?
Yes, that's them.
Yeah, I've heard a few songs by them.
What did you think?
Pretty good, they kind of have a 60's vibe about them.
I can see that. Have you heard their new album?
Not sure, when did it come out?
Last year, it's called Tell Me I'm Pretty.
Don't think I've heard of it. What are some of the songs from it?
There's Cold, Cold, Cold, Mess Around and Trouble.
I think I heard Trouble before on the radio.
All those songs are on the radio now. They're hitting it big, they even won a Grammy this year.
Really, I always thought of them as a small indy band.
Me too but they're hitting the big time now.
That's great for them. I'm from Kentucky and love seeing local boys turned good.
They are also getting their stuff on TV and movies as well. I heard Trouble on the Netflix show Santa Clarita Diet.
I think I remember that, very fitting song for the show.
Indeed, you should check out their older stuff as well, I think you'll dig it.
I will, thanks for the suggestion.
