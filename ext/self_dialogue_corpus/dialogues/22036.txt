Do you want to go see Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales?
Sure! When do you want to go?
We can go tonight if you want.
Alright, that sounds good, what time is the show?
It starts at 10:00 o'clock.
At night?!?
Yes, is that too late?
No, no, that's fine.
Ok, good.
How many Pirates movies are there now?
This will be the fifth one.
Wow, they've come a long way.
Yes, especially considering that its based off of a ride at Disney.
I know, its unbelievable.
Have they adapted the ride to the movies?
I'm not sure, I haven't been to Disney in a long time.
Yeah, me too.
I heard that Johnny Depp once was in the ride dressed as Captain Jack Sparrow.
I heard that too!
Can you imagine expecting to see a robot and instead there's Johnny Depp?
