Did you see how well the Warriors play together this year?
No I havent been watching them this playoff season.
It is quite a show.
Is KD taking over?
No they dont even need him to do that.
Wow they may need it against Lebron.
Yes I think they are ready and waiting.
Yes that is going to be exciting.
It is Steph Curry who is dominating.
Wow how can he when he is somewhat small for an NBA player.
He does it with his shooting.
How can he get open for a shot so consistently?
He is really quick.
And he gets a lot of screens set for him?
No he actually creates his own shot.
How does he do that?
His jumper is so quick.
Oh that explains it.
Yes his jumper is a thing of beauty.
Ok I will will watch his next game and enjoy the show.
