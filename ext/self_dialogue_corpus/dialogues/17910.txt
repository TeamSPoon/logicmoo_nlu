What is your opinion on Beyonce?
Honestly, i think she is kind of overrated.
Finally, someone agrees with me!
Yeah, Lemonade was a huge letdown.
I really enjoyed the visual album but the songs themselves were weak.
Yes, the only song i liked was Six Inch Heels.
Is that the one with The Weeknd?
Yes, he adds something special to that song.
That is the only stand out, i can't believe that didn't become a single.
I feel like it is too slow for a single.
Yes, that is accurate.
I hate how everything has to be mainstream to be a hit.
Well think about her other great hits, they've mostly been up beat.
That;s not true. She has great hits such as Irreplaceable and Halo.
This makes me miss her old days.
Yes, she should release an acoustic and raw album.
Unfortunately i don't see that happening any time soon.
Let's hope! Maybe after this pregnancy.
Lemonade raw and slow would be unbelievable.
Just imagine Six Inch Heels even smoother.
