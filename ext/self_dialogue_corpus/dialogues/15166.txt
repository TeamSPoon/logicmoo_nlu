Hey, how much do musicians charge to play at weddings?
You're getting married?
Yeah, next spring.
What are you looking for?
We're thinking either a small brass band or a string quartet.
They'll either charge by the hour or by the day.
I was hoping to pay them in exposure.
Don't do that.
Why not?
It's incredibly insulting to music and those who dedicated their life to it.
How so? It's background music.
You'd pay a DJ. You pay Taylor Swift when you hear her concerts live.
Yeah, but I don't have much money.
Let me tell you something: "pay by exposure" is crap. No one can survive on that because exposure never did anything to anyone.
Of course it does.
No, it doesn't. It devalues the musician because now people know they'll play for free, and won't pay them either.
Sorry, but I don't have the money to pay for musicians.
Then create a playlist and have someone hook it up to a sound system.
Okay, sorry. Don't be so rude.
Well, you're a chef. If someone said "Cater my dinner. Pays by exposure" you'd laugh in their face.
