Looking  back  what do  you think of the  clone wars movie ?
I liked  parts of it  and it  sure was action packed .
I really liked  Jackson playing  a  jedi .
It was a  shame that  fett  killed his  character .
I  kept  hoping he would  show back up  in  flash backs .
Well maybe in  another  movie  .
Its  cool  how  yoda  always shows up in  these movies
Well  he is the master .
I would  still like to  see  a  stand  alone  movie  with a  young  yoda .
Maybe  showing  how  he  finds the  force
