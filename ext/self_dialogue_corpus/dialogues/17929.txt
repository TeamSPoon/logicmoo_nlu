Do you like female singer-songwriters?
I do, but I don't think they get enough radio play.
Who's your favorite?
Judee Sill is the one I listen to the most.
I don't know Judee Sill. Is she new?
No, she was a songwriter back in the 1970s.
To whom would you compare her to?
She's kind of like Joni Mitchell, but she has her own style.
I love Joni. But I'm also listening to some of the new girls.
Like who?
Right now I really like Corrine Bailey Rae and Solange.
Is Solange a singer-songwriter? I thought she was just a singer.
No, she writes all of her own material.
I heard that her last album got good reviews.
A Seat at the Table? It's fantastic.
Would I like it if I don't like Beyonc√©?
It's really nothing like her sister's music. I think you'd like it if you like more minimalist stuff.
I do. I like all kinds of music really.
Me too. I'm also digging Allie X.
I have a couple of good tracks by her as well.
