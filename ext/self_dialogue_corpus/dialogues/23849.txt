You wanna go to the movies?
I don't know. Not really?
Oh, man, whay not?
I don't know. It's all comic book movies these days. No movies for adults.
I feel you. But at least we get new star wars, right.
Yeah, that's cool. But a grown up movie for serious, that's not ronic or dumbed down for idiots is so rare.
Well, hasn't that always been the case?
I don't know. What about Roman Polanski? He was always good.
Yeah, but people recognized it because but was different for a guy to make movies for adults.
Yeah, he was good, though.
His movies weren't so grown up. Remeber Bitter Moon?
Yeah, with uh, Michelle phifer, right?
No. You're thinking of Christan Scott Thomas.
Oh, that;s right. They were on that boat.
It was really silly. A very silly movie.
But it was mad sexy though.
Yeah, that's true.
But the Tenet was the best.
Yeah, he starred in that himself, right?
Yeah, but he did a pretty good job.
