Johnny Depp is such a good actor.
He really is. Have you seen all his movies?
I don't think all, but most, especially the more recent ones.
Have you seen Benny and Joon?
Actually, no. When was that from?
The 90s. Probably early 90s. I think it's my favorite Johnny Depp movie.
Really? I've heard of the name but not much else.
It also has Aidan Quinn, Mary Stuart Masterson, and Julianne Moore.
Which one plays Joon? I'm guessing Johnny plays Benny?
Mary plays Joon and actually Benny is played by Aidan.
So it's like a romance?
Yes, but probably not how you're thinking.
What does that mean?
Benny and Joon are brother and sister, not a couple.
Ah, I see. And Johnny and Julianne are the respective love interests?
Yes, but it's complicated.
How so?
Joon is mentally ill and cared for by Benny and, uh, Johnny's character is given to Benny when he loses a card game.
Wait, what?
Ha! Now that you're properly intrigued you need to watch the movie.
