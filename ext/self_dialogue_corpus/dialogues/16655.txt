Afternoon.
Hi.
How are you?
Well.  How are you doing?
Good good.
That's good.
Seen any good live music lately?
Yeah just about every week really.
Oh yeah?  Where abouts?
There is a pretty active local music scene around us.
Oh that's nice, wish it was like that around here.
You don't have a lot of local music?
No not really, live in kind of a small town.
Oh I see.
Yeah it's okay.
Love live music.
Yeah me too, we just have to drive for a long time to the shows.
Yeah I understand.
Good talking to you.
You too.
