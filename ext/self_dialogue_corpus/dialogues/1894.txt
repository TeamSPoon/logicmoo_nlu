How do you think the Dolphins are going to do this year?
Not too sure they are in a tough division.
They made the playoffs last year.
They caught some breaks and depended so much on their running back.
What was his name again?
Jay Ajayi, he helped them out a lot.
Have your seen there schedule this year?
Ya it is going to be a lot tougher.
Tannehill might mature and do better under the new offense.
Here's to hoping.
When you are in the same division as the Patriots you can't expect to much.
Ya they are beast to contend with.
Adam Gase's offense might finally be able to bring down the Patriots.
The Patriot defense isn't what you need to worry about it's their offense.
The Dolphins are going to have an uphill battle for those two games.
Tell me about it.  I got tickets to one of the Patriot games.
How did you swing that?
Bought them from a guy at work selling them.
Have a great time, Hopefully the Dolphins pull out a win.
That's what I'm hoping for.
