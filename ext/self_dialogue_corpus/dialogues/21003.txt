Do you know the movie Alice in Wonderland?
The live action one or the original cartoon version? I've seen them both.
I meant the cartoon version. I didn't know there was a live action version.
Oh yes, a first and a second one!
Are they any good?
I've only seen the first one, but it's a Tim Burton film, so it's a little weird.
Tim Burton is one of my favorite directors.
You would love this movie then! Lots of colors and trippy scenes.
Who is in it?
Well, Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter both are, obviously.
Who do they play?
Johnny Depp is the Mad Hatter and Helena Bonham Carter is the Red Queen. Anne Hathaway is also in it, as the White Queen.
Do you like it any more or less than his other movies?
Personally, I think it's one of his best ones.
Really!? Why do you say that?
I just thought he put an interesting spin on the original tale. It's very action packed.
Would it be okay for my children, do you think?
I think it would be okay for most. There is not much violence.
Good to know. I'll check it out!
Let me know what you think of it!
