Hey, what kind of music do you like?
I actually have always been into heavy metal.
Really?  I thought that stuff was kind of harsh.
Sometimes it can be. But it is empowering to listen to Metallica when you are going through emotional times.
Are they your favorite?
I like a few bands, but Metallica is my favorite.
Who else do you like?
It's a bit of a guilty pleasure, but I actually really dig Manowar.
Oh man, is that metal? they are like power ballads with lyrics out of a thor comic!
Don't give me a hard time! I said it was a guilty pleasure.
What do you like best about these groups music?
I like the lyrics of course, but the guitars are really powerful.
Have you seen Metallica in concert?
I have, a few times when I was younger.
How long ago?
In the late 1990's when I was a teenager.
But not since then?
Nah, they're just old now.
Wow! some fan you are.
Hey I just like some of them music, I'm not in love with them.
