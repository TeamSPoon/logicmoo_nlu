Have you seen that movie Moonlight that won best picture?
Yeah, I saw it.
Do you think I should rent it?
If you want to see it, I would wait until it's on HBO or something.
Why? I heard it was supposed to be really good.
I heard that too. Maybe that's why I was disappointed.
What disappointed you?
It just felt like not very much happened. It was kind of weak on plot.
From what I know of the plot, it sounds pretty good.
I don't know how to describe it. It's like most things happened off-screen.
Example?
One of the main characters dies, but you only find out when someone makes a brief reference to it.
That's not necessarily bad.
I agree. It could work, but it just felt like every scene was in slow motion.
I tend to like movies like that.
You might like it then.
Were the characters good?
Yes, they were, but sometimes they weren't really fleshed out.
I've heard so many things about it that I think I'm going to rent it, but I get what you're saying.
I hope you enjoy it.
