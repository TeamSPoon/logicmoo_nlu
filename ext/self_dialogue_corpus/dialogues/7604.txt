Did you watch the last Harry Potter movie?
It was pretty cool.
I liked the part where Voldemort finds the elder wand.
Yeah, that was cooler than the last battle.
It was so creepy.
They tried to bring back some humanity to Tom Riddle.
I'm not sure about the Harry and Voldemort duel.
Why?
It seemed like they were flying around as black smoke a lot.
Voldemort can fly without a broom.
