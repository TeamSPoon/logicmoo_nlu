Have you heard Blake Shelton's latest song?
Which one are you talking about?
Well the newest I heard was that song about a Guy with a Girl.
Yeah I really don't like that song, although I think he's great.
I know!  I love most of his music but I feel like that one is weak.
I don't like how his voice sounds in it.  It's whiny.
That and the lyrics are just kinda blah to me.
Yeah, I agree.  But most of his music is incredible.
I know, I really like Doin' What She Likes and Neon Light.
Yeah, me too.  And Drink on It is great.
Yeah, they're all really catchy with great lyrics.
What was the name of his first album?
I really can't remember!  He's been around longer than I thought.
Yeah, I first started hearing him just a few years ago.
Me too, but I think he was making music long before that.
I hope he keeps producing new music and albums so we can get more of him.
Oh I bet he will.  It doesn't seem like he's quitting anytime soon.
Not considering how famous he's become.
No, I doubt it.  I'd love to see him in concert.
Me too.  Maybe he'll come nearby.
