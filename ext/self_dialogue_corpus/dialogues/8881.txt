What do you think about Madonna?
She had some good songs in the 90s, like Ray of Light.
I actually saw her in concert in the late 90s.
I would have liked to see that. I wouldn't pay to see any concert of hers today, though.
Why not?
It's just not the same anymore. I think her glory days were the 80s and 90s.
Yeah, seeing Madonna perform now wouldn't be the same.
I have some of her CDs.
I actually have cassettes still going back to the mid-80s.
You're one of her old super-fans!
