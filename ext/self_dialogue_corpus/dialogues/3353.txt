Are you a fan of horror films?
No! I did like Paranormal Activity, however.
That was a good one! I never saw the sequels.
Those were okay, but the original is all you had to watch.
What a great concept.
I know! The filmography was fantastic. A truly original idea.
Do you think more will be made?
Probably not. They put out like 3 or 4 movies in just a few years.
I know. They did not take their time with those.
I liked Paranormal Activity 3 as well.
