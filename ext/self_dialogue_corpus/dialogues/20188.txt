Have you seen Office Christmas Party?
I'm not sure - I saw so many Christmas movies this year. Who's in it?
Jennifer Aniston, T.J. Miller, and that guy - I can't remember his name - the guy from Arrested Development?
Jason Bateman?
Yes, that's him!
I love Jason Bateman! I didn't know he was in a movie with Aniston and Miller!
Yes! I just rented Office Christmas Party and I was blown away by the cast. so if you haven't seen it I definitely recommend it.
I think I'd remember if I saw a movie with Aniston, Bateman and Miller. When did it come out?
At the end of 2016. It's really, really funny.
Sounds good, maybe I should check it out.
I'd say so. I'm not usually into Christmas movies - usually I find them too cheesy, but Office Christmas Party breaks the mould.
Oh yeah? It's not all about some big-eyed kid learning the true meaning of giving?
Haha, no, definitely not. Actually, it's really not a kids' movie - it's rated R, so I would definitely not watch it around any children.
Oh, good to know! So it's pretty crude?
Well, I wouldn't say it's gratuitously crude but, yes - it's pretty typical of the comedy you can expect from a guy like T.J. Miller.
Got it - so I should be prepared for lots of swearing and off-color humor.
Correct. And, you know, that T.J. Miller crudeness is balanced out by Jason Bateman's sweetness.
Haha, awesome. To be honest, I'm willing to try anything that features Jennifer Aniston.
Agreed, she is underrated and awesome. So, yes, if you're in the mood for a slightly raunchy laugh, check out Office Christmas Party. I loved it.
Good to know, thanks so much for the recommendation!
