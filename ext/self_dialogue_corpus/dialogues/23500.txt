What movie genres are you into?
I like suspense, horror and comedy the best. You?
I enjoy those, too. What's your favorite horror movie?
I like the Stephen King movies myself.
They are great. Christine, It, Thinner and Cujo I love.
I didn't like Cujo, I thought it was a little silly.
Really? The dog was scary!
Not to me, I guess it's because I'm not afraid of Saint Bernards.
Do you like the Pet Semetary movies?
Those were good. I was freaked out bigtime.
The second one was the best in my opinion.
Agreed. Gus was terrifying.
He really was. When he was left alone with Clyde, I knew Clyde was a goner.
Clyde deserved it though. He was such a bully.
What comedies do you like?
Classic comedies are my favorite. 80s mostly.
Like "Ferris Bueller's Day Off" and "Sixteen Candles"?
Those were the best!!
"Breakfast Club" was one of my favorites.
Oh yeah, that's a good one. Judd Nelson, Molly Ringwald, Ally Sheedy... All great actors.
