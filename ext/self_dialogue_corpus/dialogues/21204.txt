Have you been to the movies lately?
No, I don't go to the theater a whole lot anymore.
Why is that?
I got a huge TV at home, I don't need to go to the movies any longer.
Your missing out man! I am telling you!
Have you been to one lately?
Yeah, I just saw the new wolverine movie.
How was it?
It was pretty cool, you gotta go and check it out.
Maybe I will.
The movie had a lot of action and excitement, you gotta see it on a big screen to appreciate it.
How long was the movie?
About two hours.
Wow, I like wolverine movies.
Yeah man you should definitely check it out.
hmmm, intresting.
I thought about watching it myself for a second time.
No kidding, do you mind if I join? I will buy the tickets.
Cool man, how about Tuesday?
Sounds good man, see you than.
