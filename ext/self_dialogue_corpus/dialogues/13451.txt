Did you know that Ewoks are miniture versions of Wookies?
How do you mean?
In Return of the Jedi, Endor was originally supposed to be a Wookie planet.
Probably saved a ton on costumes.
Probably so! That would have been cool though.
True, but they did kind of do that in the prequels.
Yeah, I thought they did a pretty good job on that.
Yeah, if you like a lot of CGI!
I wonder if they'll introduce more Wookies in the new trilogy.
Maybe a Wookie spin off.
