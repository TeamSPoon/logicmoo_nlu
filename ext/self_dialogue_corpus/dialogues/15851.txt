Hey, so what do you think of Snoop Dogg?
He's the best rap artist of all time, that's what!
Yeah, I totally agree!  He's done so many amazing things besides just make music, too.
Yeah, I think I even heard he's written a kid's book.
I think he has.  But either way, he's been in movies, on television shows, and has continued to make great music.
I swear, his albums are some of the only ones I know of that I can listen to straight through.
Yeah, and Doggystyle was definitely the best.
Doggystyle was amazing but his others have been amazing too.
Even some of his newer stuff like Vapors and Midnight Love has a totally different sound but is amazing.
Yeah I heard those, they are great!
And his music videos play like mini-movies, they are awesome too.
He's just a genius.  Everything he's done is brilliant.
I actually saw him live in Fresno, California back in 2003 or so.  It was the Up In Smoke tour.
Oh, seriously?  How was that!
It was awesome!  It was a really small venue so I could see him pretty up close.
I bet it was amazing.
Yeah, the sound was a little strange just being live hip hop music, but it was still awesome.
I would've loved to see him in person.
I bet he's still touring, isn't he?
At some point he may.  I don't know.
