Did you hear about Soundgarden frontman Chris Cornell?
Yes I did. So very sad.
His music was so influential throughout my life.
Mine too! I fell in love with Temple of the Dog.
Same here, as well as Audioslave and his solo albums.
Did you ever see him live?
Yes I did. In 2011 during his "Songbook" tour.
I bet that was amazing.
Sure was! He sang a version of "Billie Jean" that was breathtaking.
He really could sing the phonebook and people would listen.
That is true! haha! I've been listening to old Soundgarden songs.
Like back when they were semi-punk?
Yes. Interesting how his music has evolved.
And how he can so easily mesh with other musicians.
He and Eddie Vedder as like magic together.
Totally agree. "Hunger Strike" is one heck of a song.
Also love "Say Hello to Heaven."
Ironic song now isn't it.
That it is. Probably played that 10 times already this week.
Rest in Peace, Chris Cornell.
