So who were your favorite casting choices in the Harry Potter movies?
Well, Daniel Radcliffe was perfect for Harry. I also think Emma Watson nailed Hermione's character.
How about Alan Rickman?
Yeah, he played a wonderful Snape. Not quite how I pictured him from the books, but he played the part so well that it didn't matter.
Luna was good, too.
Oh, for sure! I don't remember the actress's name, but she did really well as a character that was both dreamy and fiercely intelligent.
Don't forget about Professor McGonagall.
Of course! Maggie Smith was perfect!
I also thought the Malfoys were portrayed really well.
I totally agree.
