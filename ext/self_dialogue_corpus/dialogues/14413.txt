Do the Cavaliers go 16-0 in the playoffs?
No they have no shot at that.
Do the Warriors go 16-0 in the playoffs?
I cant see that happening.
Do you think both of those teams end up 12-0 heading into the Finals?
Yes but then the real season starts.
Can you see it going all 7 games.
I sure hope so.
The NBA playoffs have been boring so far.
Yeah its a top heavy league and that is real apparent right now.
Hard to believe Boston was a number 1 seed.
Cleveland wasnt concerned about seeding.
So they could have been 8th and survived.
Absolutely they have the best team in the East.
Just because James is on the roster?
Couple him with Irving, and yes.
Notice you didnt bring Kevin Love into that.
Hes a part time player.
So hes better served on the bench?
Yeah he needs a strong supporting cast around him in my opinion.
