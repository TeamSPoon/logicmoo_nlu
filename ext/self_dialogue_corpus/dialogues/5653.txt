Did you watch 'Aladdin' as a kid?
I probably watched it way too many times.  Such a fun movie.
Can you believe it's been nearly 25 years since it was released in 1992?
I can't believe it is that old.  Especially because of how timeless it is.
'A Whole New World' is still one of the best Disney songs.
I agree, which is saying a lot because there were so many other great songs in that movie.
The character that always stands out in my mind is Robin Williams' Genie.
Genie was such a cool character.  Robin made that character his.
Exactly.  No one else could ever play a better genie.
I absolutely agree.  And who knew he could sing?
