Which ship battle was your favorite out of all the Star Wars movies?
I thought that the battle in Return of The Jedi was really good. How about you?
Personally, and I know this is going to be a bit of an unpopular opinion. But I really liked the Rogue One ship battle.
Oh that's interesting. Why is that?
Well don't you remember how Admiral Raddus ordered them to ram those two star destroyers into each other?
Oh yeah I had forgotten about that. That was super cool.
I honestly think those last fifteen minutes were the absolute coolest parts of that movie. Hands down.
Yeah and when Vader comes in swinging at all those rebels. You can just feel the fear.
He straight up crushed that one dude up against the ceiling! Insanely awesome.
I don't know how I felt about the CG Leia though. A little gaudy, but I guess it worked.
