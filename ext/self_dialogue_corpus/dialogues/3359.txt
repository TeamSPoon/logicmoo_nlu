Have you seen 'Paranormal Activity'?
Yeah, I didn't care for it though.
Neither did I. I'd heard such good reviews.
It just didn't scare me. The acting in the normal scenes was so corny.
I thought so too - they were kind of bad at normal acting, which made the hysterical acting just seem ridiculous.
It didn't even creep me out. I was pretty disappointed.
And there's so many sequels!
Exactly! I'm sick of Hollywood not making any original horror movies.
It's all just remake after remake. I liked the English language remake of 'Let The Right One In', though.
I haven't seen it - I've only seen the original.
