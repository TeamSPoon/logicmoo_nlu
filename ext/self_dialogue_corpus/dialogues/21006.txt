You knpw that Colliseum scene in the Gladiator?
Yes. One with the chariots, and russell crowe was all "hey let's form the line" blah blah.
Yes... I guess that should describe it. Any way, remember that scene where the chariot flips over?
Mm Hm.
See they can't really ensure a chariot flips over like that unless you rig soemthing
Rig something like an explosion?
Something like that, except not really an explosion, you don't want people to get hurt.
Of course not. Who wants a lawsuit.
No. So what they did is rigging up an air cannon that will shoot enough air the flip the chariot over, but still be safe for those who are on the set.
ok, and?
Well, the camera caught the air caanon in the back of the chariot.
Get out. no way!
Yes, way. and there really was no way to edit it out without ruining the continuity of the movie, and they left it in
No way,. Get out... Ok I'm going to que that up and take a look.
Go ahead. It's the scene where...
This is it. Be quiet. Is it after this? No wait, this is too far. Go back.
It's where the chariot bumps into the side and flips over
I know!. ok I found it.
See that gas tank? Just at the chariot flips over and the guy's thrown to the side, you see this giant gas tank.
Hahaha. That was awesome.
