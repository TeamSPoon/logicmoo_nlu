Did you hear Derek Carr is finalizing a new deal with a Raiders?
No I didn't, who did you hear that from?
Per Adam Schefter. Deal is "close" to done and should be announced by the end of the week.
How much is the deal for?
$25 million per year.
That would make him the highest paid quarterback in the leauge, right?
Yes. Currently Andrew Luck is the highest paid quarterback, getting paid at $24.594 million yearly.
That's a lot of money. What % of the team's cap is that?
2017 cap is $167 million rite now, so roughly 15%. Next step in Mack I'm sure.
Mack will probably command around $22 million a year I think. Gonna be more than people expect. So two players would command 28% the Raider's cap, but without these two combined, the Raiders probably win 3 games instead of 12 last year.
Yeah this is all pretty crazy to say about 2 players.
Indeed but Carr is the focal point of the Raiders offense and Mack had so many strip fumble sacks to close the game out last year I lost count.
RIP Raiders' SB chances.
I wouldn't say that. The Raiders are a very young team.
As far as being competitive....gonna be tough. Once you commit that much money to 1, or especially two guys, your roster suffers.
As long as they win a Super Bowl in the next four years, the contracts will have no negative effect until then.
I guess everybody is just going to have to wait and see how all this plays out.
Yup, can't doing anything about it but in a few years the Raiders will be in Vegas and this could be huge for the team.
It could be but imagine if Carr or Mack gets hurt, that's all basically dead money at that point.
True but I think the Raiders have done a great job at protecting Carr when the ball is in his hands.
