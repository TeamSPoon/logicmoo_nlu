Who do you think is going to win the superbowl this year?
I'm not sure, the patriots are always good so they're a good bet.
But the cowboys have a strong team with Dak and Elliot
That is a good point, but I do like my Packers! They have a great receiving core and a solid offensive line.
Aaron Rodgers is a beast, have you seen his TD to INT ratio? It's off the charts!
Sure, but he needs to stay healthy, remember when he was injured by the bears? Even last year he was injured a bit.
He can be legendary if he could only win more superbowls
Yeah but Favre only won 1 and he's still legendary
I suppose, but look at Brady, he's probably going to be remembered as the best QB of all time
I can't believe he's still playing at such a high level, if only Rodgers had such great teams
I think this year it's fiinally the packers year don't you?
Possibly, but there are so many more options
If you had the first pick in our fantasy draft who would you take
Rodgers no doubt
See then clearly the Packers are one of the frontrunners!
But Brady is a close second
Then again you can't discount injuries
Honestly, whichever team weathers the injury storm the best will likely be in the best position
Totally agree, you look at the past superbowl winning teams and they all were miraculously healthy
Well, only time will tell which team will avoid the injury bug, here's to a safe and competitive NFL season!
