do you like tim burton
i love edward scissorhands
another johnny depp and tim collaboration
that movie got me in my emotions
its so cool the family accepted edward
yeah, its a nice story
johnny did a good job playing as him
yeah, johnny likes those weirdo characters
he likes those dark weird characters
he plays them very well though.
yeah, he is a weirdo himself
so maybe hes just playing a part of himself in his movies
that could be true honestly.
i havent seen the movie in a while
i wanna watch it again to be honest
its one of my favorite tim burton films
its the same for me
i think this was one of his most popular films
it may have made them popular actuall
yeah, maybe
