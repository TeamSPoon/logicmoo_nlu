I'm like 25 years late, but finally saw Silence of the Lambs.
Jodie Foster's best movie in my opinion.
Hannibal was truly one of the best villains ever.
The weird thing is he's kind of anti-villain in some weird fashion.
Nah.  He murdered the prison guards and was crazy.
But Hopkins performance was second to none.  He made that character.
It creeped me out as I really thought he was a serial killer.
His voice just gives me shivers.
I'll never drink another Fresca again after watching it.
Yeah, no kidding.
