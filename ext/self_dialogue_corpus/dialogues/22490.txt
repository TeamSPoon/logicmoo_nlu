Have you seen that movie Sisters?
No, I don't think so. Who is in it?
Those two women from Saturday Night Live that hosted the Golden Globes. Tiny Fey and Amy Poehler.
Oh yeah! I like them. Is the movie good?
Yes, it is very funny. Those two are crazy.
Well what happens in it? Don't me everything?
First of all Tina Fey is the one who is the party girl.
You mean when they were younger, right? Because I remember they are supposed to be having a house party for some reason?
Yeah. Because the blonde girl never really partied when she was younger so they were going to have a party because their parents are selling the house.
So, it is like their last chance to have a party before the house goes?
What they want is for their parents not to sell the house. You should see it.
I think I will go. I'm pretty sure you don't wan to see it again.
Yes I do.
Want to go with me tonight? I am bored and I need something to do.
Sure why not. You are buying right?
What?
You heard me.
Fine, but you are driving.
Okay see you at 7:30.
Okay.
