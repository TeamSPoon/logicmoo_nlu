Do you like The Beatles' music?
Oh yeah, I love the Beatles. What's your favorite album?
I can't really decide, but I really like Let It Be. It has so many good songs that people ignore.
Like which songs? The title track is pretty popular, I know
I Me Mine is one of George's better songs, and it's on Let It Be
I like that one. Get Back is another one of those classic songs that you don't hear enough of nowadays
Don't Let Me Down is a great song, but they didn't include it on the album originally
Why's that? I really like that song, too
I think it had something to do with their producer, Phil Specter
I heard about that. I'm just glad the other songs got released so we could enjoy them as they were originally arranged.
