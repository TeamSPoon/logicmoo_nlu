Did anyone get to see Transformers: The Last Knight yet?
No, I have not.  It sounds like a thriller action movie.  Did you like it?
I will go see it this Friday.
Who plays in the movie?
Mark Wahlburg, Isabella Moner, and Anthony Hopkins is even in this one.
Sounds like an all star cast.
It is playing down at Crossroads today at 7pm after work.
I wish I could go, but I have a few things I have to work on tonight.
Maybe next time we can go to another movie!
Sounds great!
