Do you like Led Zeppelin?
I think their songwriting is really good. I don't listen to them much, though.
Yeah a lot of people only judge them by "Stairway to Heaven".
That's actually one of the only songs I know by them.
What rock bands do you listen to?
I really love Black Sabbath.
They are great. Ozzy is the man.
He is wild. Their music just has a sense of style to it.
Yeah it's very dark and stylistic.
I feel like they were making music that no one else was at the time.
