Who was your favorite Monsters Inc. character?
Sully was my favorite.
He was great. There were a lot of good actors doing voices in that.
I know. John Goodman, Billy Crystal and a bunch of others.
The little girl was so cute.
She was, and not afraid of them.
Who did her voice?
I think that was Jennifer Tilly.
Yeah, it could have been.
Google it, I think I'm right.
