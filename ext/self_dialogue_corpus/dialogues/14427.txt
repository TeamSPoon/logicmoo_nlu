Whether or not the East is weaker than the West.
Everybody in this league are professionals for a reason and you cannot deny how good the Cavs look right now.
I feel the Celtics are 2 years ahead of schedule.
Right, they had a great season AND have the #1 pick.
They call it a Basketball Team for a reason, you play and you win as a team.
Your right, one player shouldn't make that much of a difference.
I like how Pops doesn't sugarcoat a failed and disappointing game!
Right, He focuses on the next game and what needs to be done! Admitting a failure and moving on.
The rest of the playoffs aren't even worth watching.
Your right, lets just skip ahead to the championship.
Do you watch NBA Inside tonight?
Yes, those GIFs are the best!
I'm not sure who is getting blown out worse: Celtics or Spurs??
I'm ready to just get the finals started.
Wait till next year the Bulls are more competitor than them if rondo is not injured it will be a massive match up agains the Cavs.
And by better match up you mean another sweep?
What is the Best series of all time?
Easy the Bulls vs Pistons in the late 80's early 90's
Who do you have winning and in how many?
I saw the Cavs in 5.
