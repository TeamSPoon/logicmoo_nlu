There is something I don't fully understand about 'The Fate of the Furious.'
What would that be?
Why did Charlize Theron's character need Dominic Toretto for her plan?
I have no idea.
If you think about it, Dom's only skill is driving.  What use did a super hacker have of a driver?
Dom is also a good fighter, and is the only one who could stop his crew.
But if Charlize's character didn't recruit Dom in the first place, the crew never would have intervened.
Oh, and then her plan would not have been ruined.  I think you're onto something.
I'm glad I could get that off my chest.  The rest of the movie, after accepting that premise, was really fun.
The action sequences were so well shot, and the set-pieces were executed flawlessly!
