Let's keep it going with covers
Man, you never get tired of this subject do you?
Well, not really, but it's more music in general that I never get tired of.  Now, more covers you did!
Okay, let's see... "Nothing's Gonna Stand in Our Way" by Spectre General aka Kick Axe.
You know, I don't think I've even heard of that group.
Will they're mainly known for being a big part of the transformers movie soundtrack.  The ORIGINAL cartoon movie from the 80s, not the Michael Bay stuff.
Wait, a minute, I've seen that movie, I bet if i heard the song again, I'd probably remember it.
Yeah, they use three of their songs in the movie.  Anyway, this one's a cover from an older 70s hit.  The original is just kind.. bland really.
Bland?
Yeah, I just don't care for it.  Granted, I'm biased I heard the KA version looong before I even knew it was a cover of something else, but still.
So, why does the band have two names?
Well, they're actual name is Kick Axe, but I guess when they were doing the soundtrack they were worried that parents might object to the band's name, so the changed it to Spectre General.
I have to admit, Spectre General does have a bit of cleverness to it.
Yeah, but I can't help but wonder if the band was all, "No one who seems the movie is going to know who we REALLY are!  This stinks!"
Dunno.. not sure how big of a box office hit the original transformers was...
Yeah... so, another cover?
Well, I liked "Video KIlled the Radio Star" by Presidents of the USA.
Where have I heard that?
The played on the credits to The Wedding Singer
Oh yeah!  That wasn't too bad!
