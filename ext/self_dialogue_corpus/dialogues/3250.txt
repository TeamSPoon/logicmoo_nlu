Have you ever seen this horror film called "Candyman"?
I'm not sure.  Who's in it?
Virginia Madsen and Tony Todd are the main actors.
Oh, I like Madsen.  She's a good actress.
I agree.  She does good work in it.
What year was it made?
It was made in 1992.
I like early '90s horror films a lot.
Well, this one's really creepy!
Oh, I'll like it then.
