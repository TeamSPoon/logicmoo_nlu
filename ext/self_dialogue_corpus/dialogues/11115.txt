Ye, it is just like the one I am working on now.
How have the sewing lessons been coming along by the way?
Great! MiMi is a fantastic teacher. She is teaching us so much about the art of sewing.
That's good. I can't wait for you to make something for your favorite sister.
Girl, you know I will.
Speaking of sisters, have you heard from Janice this week?
No, I haven't. She has not called since we saw her at the hospital.

Yes, I hope so as well.
Let's give her a call.
I have a better idea, let's take surprise her and take her shopping.
