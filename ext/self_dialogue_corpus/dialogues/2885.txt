What do you think of the NFL?
I think it is incredible.
Me too.
I can't wait for the season to begin.
Absolutely.
What team are you rooting for?
I'm rooting for the Eagles this season.
How about the Steelers?
No way.  I bleed green!
Which team do you want to see them play the most?
I want to see the Eagles vs. the Redskins.
That sounds like a great matchup.
You bet.
What are the prospects for the Eagles?
Well they had a bit of a rough season last year, but it should be better this year.
Really, how'd they do last season.
They went with 7 wins and 9 losses, but I hope for better this year.
Boy, I hope you are right for your sake.
I want to get to the games this year.
Take me with you!
