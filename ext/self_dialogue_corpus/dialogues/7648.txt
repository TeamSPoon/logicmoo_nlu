I just started watching the Harry Potter movies this weekend.
You just started watching them!? Why haven't you seen them before now?
Well, I really like the books, but I was worried that the movies would ruin them for me.
Oh, I understand. How far have you gotten?
I watched the first two last weekend.
And what do you think so far?
They're really similar to the books so far, I really like them. I think Daniel Radcliff is the perfect Harry.
The first three movies or so are really similar to the books, but they start to change things up a little in the fifth one and on.
Well, I'm looking forward to watching the rest.
Let me know what you think!
