I just watched one of the "Pirates of the Caribbean" series movies. It was such an amazing experience. I really loved Johnny !
Oh yes. It's an amazing series. Which one did you watch ?
I watched the "The Curse of the Black Pearl". I especially liked the way it ended. What a climax !
Is this the first "Pirates of the Caribbean" you ever watched ? Wow, this one released in 2003. You are 14 years too late.
Oh common ! I was not watching it for the first time. In fact, I have watched all five of them many times.
Thank God ! I was wondering if you are at all living and keeping up with the real world.
Which one is your favorite one ? Mine is the 2nd one which was released in 2006.
Oh. Dead Man's Chest is it ? I liked that one as well. However, my favorite remains the one which was released in 2011; On Stranger Tides.
Well...Honestly, it's do difficult to tell one over the other. All of them are pretty good. Do you know, if they are planning to bring the 6th one sometime in future ?
Though, I am not very sure. But, I heard rumors that they were planning to shoot the 6th one back to back the 5th one. If that's to be believed, we might have another treat in 2018 !
