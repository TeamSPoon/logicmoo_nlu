It's funny how they use working titles when making films.
Not sure what you mean.
For instance, instead of calling it Star Wars, they'll call it something different like Blue Harvest.
Guess what the working title of the second prequel was?
The Search for More Money?
It was actually Jar Jar's Big Adventure.
That's funny and creative all at once.
It was a tongue and cheek reference to that vilified character.
It may not have been worse than Attack of the Clones anyway.
Very true!
