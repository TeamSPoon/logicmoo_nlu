What is your favorite Johnny Depp movie?
He's been in a lot of great movies, but I'd probably have to go with Edward Scissorhands.
Yeah, Edward Scissorhands is definitely one of his most iconic roles. It's so hard to choose a favorite though!
He has quite a body of work behind him. I like a lot of the movies he's done with Tim Burton.
Those two make a pretty great team. Sweeney Todd is another favorite of mine.
I'm not usually much for musicals, but I've got to say that was one of the better ones that I've seen.
I never knew that Johnny Depp can sing like that!
I know, is there anything that guy can't do? I didn't care much for his interpretation of Willy Wonka though.
Yeah, me either, I don't think that they should have touched that movie, Gene Wilder is the definitive Willy Wonka in my opinion.
Definitely. I could have done without those Alice in Wonderland movies that Burton made too.
Yeah, again, there are some movies that are just untouchable in my opinion.
That's true. I wonder how the new Pirates of the Caribbean will be.
I kind of stopped watching after the first two, but maybe I'll check it out, though I'm figuring it's kind of going to be more of the same.
Probably so. Have you seen him in Crybaby?
Oh yeah, I love that movie, it's so offbeat!
It's definitely a cult classic.
Johnny's definitely got a lot more eccentric in his later years, but I'm always interested to see what his upcoming projects are, though he's definitely had his fair share of misses as of late.
Yeah, like that Lone Ranger movie, that was just a bad idea all around.
Yeah, I agree, I'm not sure what the filmmakers were thinking on that one.
I guess they can't all be winners!
