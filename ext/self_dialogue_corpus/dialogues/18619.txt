Do you remember the Sonny and Cher show?
Yes, I do.
It was a big hit back then. The two of them sang great together.
Well she really did better when she was solo.
Yes, she did.
If I could Turn Back Time was a fantastic song.
Yeah, I liked it.
She is like 70 years old.
Yes, but still performs.
Song For The Lonely was dedicated to those who suffered in 9-11.
I didn't know that.
Would you ever see her in concert.
I doubt it.
You don't like her?
She's just okay. I like some of her songs, but not thrilled with her.
She did some duets with people too.
Yeah, I didn't like some of her videos.
Yeah they were racey.
She does have a pretty good voice.
Yes very distinctive.
