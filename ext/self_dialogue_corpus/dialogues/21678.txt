Have you ever seen MirrorMask?
I've never even heard of it.
You gotta check it out sometime.
What is it about?
It's almost sort of like a dark, surreal Alice in Wonderland, but it's also its own film.
That sounds crazy.
Well, I mean, Neil Gaiman did write it.
No kidding? I didn't know he also did movies.
He does sometimes. He also co-wrote the 2007 Beowulf film.
The man is so talented.
Yeah, but anyway, MirrorMask was also done by the The Jim Henson Company.
Oh, are there a lot of puppets in it?
Actually, no, it uses a lot more computer generated effects instead.
That's disappointing.
You should give it a view anyway. It's sort of like Labyrinth or The Dark Crystal.
Sounds interesting. Who's in it?
A bunch of people you probably wouldn't know. Oh, but Stephen Fry does voice work for the film.
When did it come out?
It came out in 2005, and was made on a small budget, but looks amazing despite that. It did get a super small theatrical release though.
Alright, I guess I'll see if I can't find a copy at some point.
