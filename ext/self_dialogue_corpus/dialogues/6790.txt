One of my least favorite Disney movies is Peter Pan. Do you like it?
I agree. Not much of a fan.
Peter Pan isn't that much of a likeable character.
No he's not. Even the villain isn't and I actually like some of them.
I know. The best character is Tinker Bell, and she doesn't even talk.
That's funny.
Wendy is another one. The smaller kids are cute in the movie.
Yes, I just don't know why that one was such a big hit.
Me either. Disney usually does real good movies.
Well, you figure back then, maybe they didn't have as good of writers.
