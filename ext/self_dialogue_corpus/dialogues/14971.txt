What's your all time favorite comedy?
Well, I really loved Wedding Singer because Adam Sandler is my favorite actor!
That's my favorite too! My favorite movie is 50 First Dates!
Oh, nice! I love any movie with Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore.
I totally agree!
They have great chemistry and would make the cutest couple!
Yep and I love all the music in Wedding Singer too!
Yeah, the song that he sings to her inside the plane was the sweetest ever!
I want someone to sing that to me!
It is cute when they sing in the restaurant scene too!
