Have you hard that new Iggy Azalea song?
Yeah, it's okay. She's been kind of bad of late.
Yeah she hasn't had much success with the last few singles.
Do you think her star is fading?
Maybe, we'll have to see. I think maybe people are just sick of her.
Nicki Minaj is still doing well, so it isn't a female rap thing.
I think it's because Iggy isn't authentic. People can tell.
Nicki is authentic at least. You're right, Iggy's Australian isn't she?
Yeah, but she raps with an American accent.
It's kind of cringey when you think about it.
