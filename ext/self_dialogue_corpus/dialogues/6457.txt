I finally saw Bambi the other day with the family.
Oh yeah, how did you like it?
I loved it. I can't believe I didn't see it until now.
Yeah, I'm surprised you have only just now seen it. It's a classic.
I'm behind on all the Disney movies, to be quite honest.
You should rent a bunch of them and binge watch.
Now that's an idea.
Your kids will love them.
I'm sure they will.
When you're finished, tell me what you thought of Frozen. That's my favorite one so far.
