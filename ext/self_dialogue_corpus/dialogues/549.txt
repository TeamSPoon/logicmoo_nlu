The Dolphins training camp start July 27th?
That's right around the corner!
The public can go to 13 practices.
I didn't know we could go.
They let people come to some of them. They let around 200 people in each one.
Have you ever been?
I went one year, I took my nephew when he was 10.
Did he enjoy it?
Yes, they make it a big deal.
Like what?
They have face painting food trucks.
Sounds like a fair.
Not really, but the kids can get autographs from some players.
Did your nephew get an autograph.
Yes, on a football.
Does he still have it.
I don't think so.
Why not.
I'm pretty sure he sold it.
That's hilarious.
