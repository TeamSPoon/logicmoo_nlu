Disney's Tangled was surprisingly hilarious.
I haven't seen it yet. What's it about?
It's a retold story based on the Rapunzel fairy tale.
I'll make sure I try it out with the kids soon!
It's an older Disney film, but my kids still love it because it's a musical and the songs are so catchy.
That's great, something to keep the kids entertained.
A few encounters with a horse that my baby thinks is hilarious but it has darker themes.
Disney has started to move towards a little bit of darker material. I like it.
It can be overwhelming for the kids sometimes. It usually makes a better ending though.
Exactly, they get all sad until the ending and then they're happy everything works out.
