Have you seen Aladdin?
No i usually don't watch disney movies!
Well if you gonna watch one you should watch this one!
Why is that?
Well for 1. Robin Williams, he is an amazing person who plays one of the best characters of all in Disney movies, The Giene.
What does he do?
Well he helps al out by granting him 3 wishes. but that is the giene's job.
Seems like a pretty lame job to me.
Well he also uses his 3rd wish to let the Genie free
Thats really nice, Maybe i will watch it!
