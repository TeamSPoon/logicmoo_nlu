Have you seen Pocahontas?
Ya back in the day I did watch it.
I just learned that Christian Bale was the voice of thomas.
That is surprising , you would think he would have been John smith.
I am surprised he did any voice on it at all.
It is a little bit but many big stars have voiced for disney films.
I suppose that is true. demi moore jason alexander to name a few others.
What I liked most on this movie was the music. Colors of the wind was beautiful.
That song has such a true message. I wish people coudl care more about the environment.
Disney has created some very profond music with a message.Circle of life is another song  that just wows me.
