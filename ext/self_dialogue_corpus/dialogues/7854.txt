What did you think about the fact that the kids at Hogwarts were always seemingly in danger?
Well, you know it's a movie. They wouldn't have it set up like that in real life.
That's true. I just thought they would have made more provisions knowing there were huge trolls in the area.
Yeah you're right about that. But the kids fought them off bravely.
Yes they did. I loved the life size game of chess in the first movie.
Right, Slytherin House was upset about losing to them that year for sure.
They were but Gryffindor did deserve to win the House Cup. They put their lives in danger.
I know that's right. Malfoy was a victim of bad circumstances but I still never liked the boy.
Oh I don't think anyone did. He hated on Harry so much.
He really did. All that money and power he had you'd think he'd be a little happier.
