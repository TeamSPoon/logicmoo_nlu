I love the 2002 thriller Insomnia, with Al Pacino and Robin Williams. Have you seen that?
I do not think I have seen that movie. But it already sounds good!
The essential plot is Al Pacino plays a veteran cop who travels for a case over to a small Alaska town to solve a murder case. It also the time of year where this town is light 24/7.
Oh, so it's called Insomnia because not only is Al Pacino on a case, he can't sleep?
Exactly. And Robin Williams is a key in the case and taunts Pacino's character throughout the film.
It already sounds like it could be an amazing watch. Who is the director?
I believe it is directed by Christopher Nolan, who of course, is famous for the Dark Knight trilogy years later.
Nolan has proven to be a fantastic director. I will have to check this one out!
I simply cannot recommend Insomnia enough. Keep in mind, it's a longer movie.
That should not be a problem. With a compelling story and actors, I am not worried about length.
