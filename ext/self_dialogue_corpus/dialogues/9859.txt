If you could only listen to one rap artist for the rest of your life who would it be?
Kanye West without a doubt.
Why would you pick Kanye West out of all the other artists?
He's the most  innovative artist there is.  Kanye is always switching things up.
Does he seem a little nuts to you?  Look at how he acts during awards ceremonies.
Kanye has apologized for all that, but he brings the discrimination issues right to the forefront.  He isn't afraid to tell it like it is.
What about Dr. Dre?  He's the one I'd pick if I could listen to one rap artist.
Dr. Dre is old school and I respect him.  But, Kanye brings new flavor.
Nothing will change your mind?
No, Kanye West is my favorite rapper of all time.
