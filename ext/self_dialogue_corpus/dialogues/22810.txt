did you see resurrection?
the 2pac movie?
yeah, pacs mom actually approved of it
yeah, it was cool that it was in his words
yeah, he was actually speaking throughout the movie
but it seemed less cinematic due to it
it was kinda more of a documentary with some photos and stuff
didnt have a real storyline like the new movie
all eyez on me?
yeah, i hear its bad though
yeah, not as good as straight outta compton
that is honestly super disappointing
and pacs mom didnt even give approval
but suge and diddy did
but they just care about the money
suge is in jail though
but maybe he could get money and pay for bail
thats true. suge is greedy
all he cares about is money
and diddy is no better
