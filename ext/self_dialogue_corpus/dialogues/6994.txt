Is it just me or is Ariel mean?
What are you talking about?
Well, maybe not mean, naive would be better.
She's like 15 years old though.
Yeah, but she's immature and goofy.
Again, she's 15 years old.
I guess I just think she should act more her age.
She lives underwater and her father's a king.  Why are expecting realism?
I never said anything about realism, I just don't like her as much as I should.
You really need to get out more and stop focusing on mermaids.
