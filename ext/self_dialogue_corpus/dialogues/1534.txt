What do you think of this upcoming season in the NFL?
I'm excited for it. I think there will be some great teams to watch.
It seems like an exciting rookie class.
For some positions, yes. I think it is a strong running back class, but quarterbacks, not as much.
There have just been so many changes recently with locations.
I know. LA went from having no teams to having two.
And then Vegas now has the Raiders.
I just don't see how that will work well to build a fan base.
I know. At least in LA you have a lot of people all over. Vegas seems a little remote for a team.
I feel the same way, but I guess if they were offering the best deal, it looks good to the Raiders for now.
Very true. How do you think the Texans will do this year? I feel like they are so close to a breakout year.
Well, they still need to work their quarterback situation out.
They got Deshaun Watson though didn't they?
Yes, but just because he was strong in college doesn't mean that translates to the NFL.
Very true. I guess not everyone can be  Dak Prescott.
No, not many rookies come out their first year and play like that.
I still think they have all, or at least most, of the pieces in place to finally do something really good this year.
I guess only time will tell. I think the Raiders are really going to continue the momentum from last year.
They should be fun to watch.
But when it comes down to it, I think the Patriots are going to repeat.
