You ever see Billy Madison?
Yes I did and I'm a fan of Adam Sandler.
Did you think it was funny?
At the time yes but it's child humor so not anymore though I still like it.
What did you think of the story though?
I thought it was good.
Why?
He played a character who had no responsibility and was forced to turn his life around which he did quite well but in his own way.
Yeah I thought they played that out well.
Plus he gets the girl in the end and that's always nice.
I thought it was cool how he went back to school through all the grades to have to prove himself and it shows what each grade and how kids mature.
I never thought about it from the kids perspective.
I wonder what the kids thought shooting a movie with Adam Sandler.
I bet they were happy I just hope he was nice to them.
I hear he's actually an awesome guy in real life.
That's great to hear so few celebrities are good people.
Do you like his other movies?
Yes I do and I think he's done much better over the years.
I think so too, hope he continues making films.
Me too.
