I'm so excited that pre-season football will be starting soon!
What QBs are you most excited about this year?
Tom Brady will still be awesome, but I think Aaron Rodgers is the best right now or Matt Ryan- geez he had an amazing run last year
Maybe, but honestly I was surprised by Sam Bradford on the Vikings last year. I thought he was done for.
Thats true- his stats were really good, especially with the terrible offensive line he had. But he just gets overshadowed because of all the previous team drama
True, but I never thought he would have a season like that after he left Philly
I'm excited about some of the newer QBs too- Dak Prescott and Carson Wentz in the NFC East both had amazing years for rookies
Yea, they were amazing. I'm also exited about Mariota and Winston
Yea they were hyped a lot, it will be interesting to see what kind of a season they have.
And of course you still have Andrew Luck, Eli Manning, Drew Brees, Russell Wilson...all veterans who could have amazing seasons again
Yea but what about the teams with terrible QBs? Goff was horrible, Hoyer is not good enough to be the starting QB for the 49ers.
At least they have a quarterback- who do the Jets have? Or the Browns?
Thats true- I don't even know- mayeb McGown for the Jets?
I would put him in the same boat as Hoyer- an acceptable backup but no way he can lead a team all season.
There are also some older QBs that may be on their way down
Yea, I think this season will be telling for quarterbacks like Ben Rothlesberger.
And Carson Palmer, and Eli Manning.
But who knows- Peyton Manning won the superbowl his last year when people thought he was done
True, but he wasn't playing at his previous elite level when he won.
But one of these experienced guys could do the same thing if they have the right players in place around them!
