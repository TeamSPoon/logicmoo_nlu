I watched the Lion King the other day.  But I still don't see how it is Hamlet.
Well, the uncle kills the king and takes his place.
I get that.  But nothing else about it is the same.
That's true.  Like Simba ran away after his dad was killed, not before.
And most of the characters were still alive in the end.
Timon and Pumbaa were like Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, right?
I think so.  But they did not try to help Simba get executed.
And Simba didn't have them killed either.
In short, I wish people would say that The Lion King was influenced by Hamlet, not that it's the exact same story.
But the movie is still good.  And Jonathan Taylor Thomas had the perfect voice for child Simba.
