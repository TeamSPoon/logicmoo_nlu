Star Wars is a great movie, have you seen the new cartoons?
No! I have not seen the cartoons of the Star Wars epic.
I have the whole collection of Star Wars on DVD.
I saw Empire Strikes Back" on youtube the other day, still a great movie.
I have not seen the original Star Wars in a long time.
Did you know there is a "Star Wars" 8 coming out, I saw the trailer.
Is it coming out in 2017?
Yes!, I am going to go see it when it comes out.
Star Wars 8 is called "The Last Jedi"
I wonder if Yoda is alive to play in Star Wars 8.
