I rented John Wick 2 last night.
I've heard that it was really good.  Is that the case?
Sure is.  Did you ever see the first one?
No, it's on my list of things to watch.
Well, you need to see the first one first before we can chat.
That's not very helpful.  At least give me some details.
Alright, well, he obviously is alive at the end of the first one.
Well, duh.
In this one, he's after a guy who blew up his house.
I would imagine that made him very angry.
Indeed.  This one has an extremely high body count.
I heard he killed like 80 guys in original.
That sounds about right.  He caps probably 130 in this one.
That's insane.  In like an explosion?
No, with his bare hands, guns, pencils?
Pencils?  Are you serious?
It's a running joke in the series, but yes, a pencil.
This guy doesn't sound like one to mess with.
He is indeed not.  I would stay on his good side.
I think I'll keep that in mind.
