When you pick a team to root for, is it based on whether or not you think they can win?
What sort of team?
An NFL team. Isn't it football season?
It did just start.
Right, so how do you pick a team to root for?
I guess I never really picked. I'm from Wisconsin so I like the Packers.
So it's just where you grew up?
I think that's how it is for most people.
Huh. I mean, I grew up in Oregon, but I'm not like a huge Seahawks fan or anything.
Was that the closest team.
I think so? I've never drawn out a map or anything.
So what teams do you like then?
I like the Oakland Raiders. They seem like underdogs.
So in your case it's the opposite then.
Opposite of what?
You root for the team you think is less likely to win.
Oh, yeah. I guess I do that.
Why?
I think it just makes it more exciting.
You're a little strange, but I think I understand it.
