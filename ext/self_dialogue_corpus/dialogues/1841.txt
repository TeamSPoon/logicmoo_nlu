Hi!  Are you ready for football season to start?
Oh yeah!  How about you?
Definitely!  It's the only sport I watch!
Oh, cool!  I watch a few but football is my favorite!
That's cool!  What's your favorite team?
I'm a huge Cowboys fan!  You?
Oh no!!  Eagle's all the way!
Oh boy!  Eagles??
Yes sir!  I am a huge Eagles fan!
Well I hope you are looking forward to losing!
Haha!  Yeah, well we aren't the greatest team.
That's for sure!
I know, we suck sometimes but we have passion!
Yeah, Eagles' fans are known for their passion.
Yes we are!  We can lose every game but not one fan will give up on our boys!
Well maybe that will happen this year... lose every game.  Just kidding!
Preseason starts soon, so we will see.
Yes, I cannot wait!  Our first game is against the Giants.
We play the Redskins first.  It's going to be a great season!
Yes I agree!  Cannot wait!
