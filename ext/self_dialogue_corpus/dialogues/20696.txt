So what was up with Beauty and the Beast?
Not sure what you mean I guess.
The movie banked a ton of money yet the singing was suspect.
The songs were great in it.  I'm not sure what your beef is.
I'm not explaining myself well.  I'm talking about Emma Watson.
Her performance was just fine for me and she looked great.
Has nothing to do with how she looked, everything to do with her voice.
You must be talking about the infamous autotune.
I certainly am.  If she couldn't sing, why cast her?
It wasn't that bad really.
There are tons of actresses that look pretty, can sing and perform.  Why take someone who only met 2 of the 3 qualifications?
She had name recognition too.
There would have been no harm in not having her sound more natural.
But Belle is supposed to have a pretty singing voice.
Then don't make it so obvious that it's electronically enhanced.
Wow, you are really caught up on this one.
I'm just saying, if they couldn't find the right person, keep looking.
The movie made a bazillion dollars, so they obviously did something right.
I know, I know, but I'm just calling it out anyway.
Maybe you were jealous that you weren't the beast, eh?
