I can;t get this song out of my head!
What song?
It's a small world after all.
Oh, my God. Now that song will be stuck in my head too!
Sorry.
That's Disney,,,or at least Disney World. Did that song every appear in a Disney movie?
I have no idea.
Me either! It had to be in some movie or something related to Disney, right?
I would think so. Maybe it was in "Winnie the Pooh?"
Wouldn't it be funny to hear Eor sing that song? It would be the most depressing version of that song ever!
