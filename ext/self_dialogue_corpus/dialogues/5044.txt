Do you think we will see the end of the closer position?
I do. Its a meaningless stat nowadays
The game has evolved and teams need outs not guys for specific innings.
I always thought that having a guy for one specific inning was a bit bizarre.
Same here, I think that they need to get guys out when they come up in the order.
If the meat of the lineup is in the 8th then send out your best pen arm then.
More coaches will ascribe to that  in my opinion.
I think they should be able to pitch for 2 innings a time.
Try to get max effort from the arm
Yeah you need to see how many pitches were thrown
Too many teams have just seen the outs and then been done.
RIght so if a guy comes in with a runner on first and throws one pitch and gets 2 outs, why cant he come and pitch the next inning?
Yeah it never made sense but guys what to know their roles.
Their role should be to pitch when called.
Those dudes out in the pen are creatures of habit.
So you establish early on that no one has a specific inning.
That would be a culture change across the game.
The name of the game is to win
You are changing the landscape of one third of your team
For the positive though
