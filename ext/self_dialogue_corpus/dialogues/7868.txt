I hated the second Dumbledore?
The actor or are you talking about Albus'  brother?
No, the actor.
I agree. The first one was much better. But what can you do. He died.
I know. Why did the second one always have his beard in a braid. I hated that thing.
You get upet about the smallest things.
It annoyed me.
It annoyed me that they didn't do a very good job making the movie. Dumbledore's beard, I don't really care about.
You don't like Harry Potter?
I'm not a big fan of the movies. I loved the books.
