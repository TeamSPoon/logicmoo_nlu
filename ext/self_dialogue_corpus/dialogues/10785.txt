What do you think about the Fast & Furious movies?
I think that they're basically superhero movies.
How so?
Well, they're all basically indestructible.  No matter how many car crashes or other accidents, they always leave unscathed.
That's a good point.  Pretty much no one in the core group, besides Han, died.
Remember that scene in 'Fast Five' where Dom and Brian drive off a bridge and survive?
Yea, that was pretty ridiculous.  Or the scene in the 7th where they drive through 3 buildings.
I'm pretty sure the laws of physics don't apply to any of these characters.
Also, now I'm reminded of the fact that The Rock's character gets shot by rubber bullets in the latest movie, and just shrugs it off.
Like I said, they're superheroes!
