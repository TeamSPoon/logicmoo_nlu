Which character from any disney film would you pick to spend a day with?
Ah, the fairy godmother from Cinderella.
She is cute. She'd probably grant make some cool things happen.
Exactly my thoughts, and her power seems to be short lived so one day is enough.
Though who would not want more in that case?  Disney is great at creating a fantasy world you would love to be.
Some storylines I would not want to be living out though. So much peril in some.
That is a good point. Like snow white is always under attack.
Most fairytales Disney movies are based on were even darker.
Disney does do a good job and making them child friendly. Some still terrified me as a youngster.
Yes like Maleficent scared me in sleeping beauty terribly when I was little.
