I know that many that became musical theater productions were made then.
The Lion King debuted in 1994.
I loved "The Lion King". My middle school chose that as their musical.

I was Simba. It was a good part.
I think "The Little Mermaid" came out in 1989.
It was close to the 1990's.

I agree. It would be hard to forget Ursula.
