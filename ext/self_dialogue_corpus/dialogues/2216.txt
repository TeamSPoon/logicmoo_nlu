Are you excited for the NFL season to start back?
I sure am, doesn't pre-season start soon?
Yes, it usually kicks off in August.
I am still in shock over last season's super bowl.
I know right! The Falcons dominated the first half!
Then, the Falcons lost all sense of how to play football!
Yes!  The Patriots staged the single handed greatest comeback of all time.
The Patriots tied the game and took it to over time in which they eventually won!
Tom Brady was named MVP for the greatest comeback of all time!
I tend to thing the Falcons defense should have been the MVP.
Why is that?
The Falcons performed the greatest choke of all time.
Your right about that!  The Falcons practically gave the game away!
At the end of the first half, the Falcons were ahead 21-3.
However, in the 4th quarter, the Patriots scored 19 unanswered points.
yes, and what was so amazing was they scored extra points after each touchdown.
Your right, they were unstopable in the 4th quarter!
You could feel the momentum and knew that the Patriots would win in over time.
Yes you could, and as expected the Patriots went on to win the Super Bowl.
Indeed, making it one of the greatest comebacks of all time!
