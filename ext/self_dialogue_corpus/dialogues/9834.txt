Do you think Justin Timberlake is the king of pop
He is the king of entertainment
Was he better as a solo artist?
I think his time with N Sync served him well.
He is pretty good on SNL.
I dont know whats better his songs with Lonely Island or Jimmy Fallon.
He knows how to sing for sure.
And he knows how to perform
I loved his song Holy Grail
Is that with Jay Z? If so I loved it.
