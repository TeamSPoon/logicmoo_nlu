Which do you think was better out of these two movies? The first or second John Wick movies?
I honestly preferred the second John Wick movie.
I did as well. The mannerisms Keanu Reeves had in the second John Wick movie were really odd.
Yeah and so was the story line in some ways. I feel like the second one should of been the prequel.
Indeed. The second John Wick movie felt like it needed to end on a cliffhanger to have another sequel just to do well.
I still liked the soundtrack score for both movies.
The soundtrack for this action movies was one of the better ones for sure.
It reminded me of some of the video games that become movies like Max Payne.
What did you think of the action movie Max Payne?
I liked it a lot but it left me wanting sequels.
