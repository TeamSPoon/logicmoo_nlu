Do you feel like any rappers are overrated at all?
Well, I can definitely think of one.
Who would that be.
Jay Z. In my honest opinion he's the most overrated rapper in history.
Really? He's seen as one of the best.
But realistically, he's just average.
That's silly! How can you say that.
He barely has any flow and his lyrics are too all over the place. The only reason people put him on such a pedestal is because of his wife.
I still don't buy it.
You need to recognize average rap when you hear it.
