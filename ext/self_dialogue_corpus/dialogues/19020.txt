What do you think of "long hair" music?
You mean music from the Rolling Stones?
Wrong kind of hair.
ZZ Top?
No! More like Amadeus Mozart.
Why would they call that long hair music?
I don't know. I always assumed it had something to do with the powdered wigs worn in the olden days.
I suppose that makes sense.
Well, if you want to know what I think of that, I'd say it is boring. Violins do not excite me.
Well, there are plenty of log-hair music without violins.
If I am listening to them on the radio, how do I know what kind of hair they are wearing?
Forget the hair. Think classical music.
Oh, classical music. Well, that is completely different!
So you like that type of music?
No. But I know what that is...and with or without wigs, I don't care for it.
Not at all? Not a single piece?
Well, maybe some of it is ok.
Like what?
Like the kind played during Warner Brothers cartoons! "Kill the rabbit, kill the rabbit, kill the rabbit..."
I bet the only truly "cultured" material you enjoy...is yogurt.
