I realize that I don't really 'get' punk music.
What kind of punk music are you talking about? First wave 70s punk, or more modern stuff?
Any of it, I suppose.
Well, I think the main thing is that it's nihilism in musical form.
Yeah, I guess I don't really understand, then.
Punk music was a response to the bombastic, somewhat corny music of the late 60s and early 70s.
OK, I'm with you so far.
People saw music getting more sappy and overwrought, and wanted to get back to the spirit of Rock n' Roll.
Meaning what?
Stripped down production and musicality, simple lyrics, embrace of chaos and anti-establishment feelings.
I see. So groups like The Ramones and Television were the early punks?
And then it became huge in England, with groups like The Clash and Sex Pistols.
I guess what's turned me off about Punk music is that sometimes it sounds like they can't play their instruments too well.
It's true that Punk doesn't care that much about musicality. It's more about energy and enthusiasm.
I think I'm someone who appreciates the former more than the latter.
Then it's definitely possible that Punk music isn't for you.
I expect that it's not. But at least I understand it a little better now.
I'm glad I was able to help out.
Now, can you explain the philosophy of Jazz music?
Haha, you're on your own for that one!
