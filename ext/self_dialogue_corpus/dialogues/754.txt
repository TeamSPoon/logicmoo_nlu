Are you an NFL fan?
Of course what red-blooded american male isn't?
Without being to sexist - I have to agree.
And yet there are a huge number of female NFL fans too these days though.
Yeah I think I read an article about how that is a huge growing market for the NFL - women fans.
Yeah until Goodell did everything imaginable to bust that.
Do you have a favorite team?
I do I love the Patriots.
Think they have a shot at repeating this year?
I think every year Brady stays healthy - they will have a shot until he decides to retire.
I might agree for the next 2-3 years - not that they will win the SuperBowl, but they will be near at the end.
I will admit - I was about to turn off the SuperBowl last year, when they started to makle their comeback.
My daughter had already gone to bed, so I get it. It was an amazing Brady comeback.
I know - he should have retired...its impossible to top that.
Five SuperBowl rings... the most of any player - never mind a quarterback
Yeah I think some defensive player gas 5 also and thats it.
You have to give him props and admire his talent and skill.
Thats nice to hear from a non Patriots fan.
I know I should hate him as a Bronco fan, but you just cant.
Any man should hate him! Talk about having it all... career, money..and hot wife to boot.
