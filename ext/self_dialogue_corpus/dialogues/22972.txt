One movie genre I tend to enjoy is actually versus movies. For example, Freddy vs Jason.
I loved that movie when it first came out. I assume you have seen it, as well?
Absolutely! I was a huge fan of both series back in their hay-day.
Me too. Even though I was more of a Freddy Krueger fan, for I felt those movies were a bit more fun.
I can see that. I think Friday The 13th was more fans of gore and just straight up slasher flicks.
Yes, I agree. Freddy was a bit more creative but eventually he became a bit of a pop icon, actually.
I remember that. But getting back to Freddy VS Jason, what are your thoughts?
I think it's a movie that came a bit late, but it was a lot of fun to watch it finally happen.
Have you recently seen it?
I remember watching it with a couple of friends a year or two ago. It doesn't hold up greatly, but it is still entertaining.
I agree with that statement. Do you kind of wish they had fought more?
To an extent, yes. I feel at times less is more but it felt more Freddy-focused until they actually fought towards the end.
That's what I thought when I recently sat down and watched it again.
But that being said, I do think their ending fight was pretty cool and I still enjoy it.
I think the gore was a little over the top at times, but do you think that was the point?
Oh, definitely. The director knew what he was doing when he made this.
I hate to keep overusing the word "fun", but I think that's the best word to describe this movie.
Yes, I agree. Even after all of these years later.
Plus, it's Robert Englund's last time playing Freddy in a motion picture.
That is right! Good point.
