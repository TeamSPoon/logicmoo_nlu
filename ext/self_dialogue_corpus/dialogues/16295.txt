What types of music do you like?
I like basically all music except heavy metal.
Do you have a genre that is your favorite?
I'd have to say classic rock.
Any favorites in particular?
Bruce Springsteen is my all time favorite, but from that general genre, Bon Jovi, AC/DC, The Who, Poison. I guess all of them.
They are all different from each other.
I know. There's a harder rock, soft rock, and everything in between. I just like it all.
Have you ever seen any of them in concert?
Only Bruce Springsteen and Bon Jovi.
I bet they were good concerts.
Yes they were. I saw Bon Jovi when they were touring the What About Now album.
Some of the newer music is good, but I just really like the classics the best.
I tend to agree with that. I don't necessarily feel the same about Springsteen though.
I think his older stuff is better too.
For the most part I think you are right, but I really like the Wrecking Ball album and his album Magic.
I guess I don't know those.
They are both worth checking out.
He tends to get very political on his songs.
He does, but not overtly for the most part. You have to know what you are listening for.
