Hey, have you seen any good movies lately?
Yeah. I saw Arrival recently.
Cool, what's it about?
About Aliens who visit earth.
That's been done before.
True, but the aliens weren't trying to kill everyone.
Oh really? That's different, what else?
It's about first contact and trying to communicate with the aliens.
Maybe I'll watch that then.
Yeah, I think it's worth watching.
Who's acting in the movie?
Amy Adams and... I can't remember anyone else.
The chick from the Superman movies?
That's her.
She's kind of cute.
Yeah, but getting old.
I don't mind a mature woman.
Hah, good for you. You'll have enjoy the movie then.
I'll check it out then.
Good idea, I'll watch it with you.
