Have you heard of Soundgarden?
Is that a band?
Yes, they were big in the 1990s.
What kind of music do they play?
Grunge music. They are from Seattle.
Are they similar to Nirvana?
They are actually. Both of those bands are from the same city.
I didn't know that. Cool fact.
Yes, the two bands play similar music. But I prefer Soundgarden.
Do they play that band on the radio?
They do! A lot actually.
Cool, I'll listen for them next time I turn it on.
Check out the local alternative station and I am sure they will be playing.
I will do that. I might even request a song.
If you do, you should ask for "Spoonman"
Is that a hit of the band?
Yes, it is a great song. Lots of people love it.
Cool! That is one the one I will request then.
It has a great guitar part.
Good to know. I love guitar in rock music.
