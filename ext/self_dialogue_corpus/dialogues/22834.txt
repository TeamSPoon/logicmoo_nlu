Do you remember the movie The Wizard of Oz?
Oh yeah!  That's one of my all time favorites.
Yeah, it is great.  Judy Garland as Dorothy is amazing.
Yeah, and the soundtrack is great.  I love when she sings Somewhere Over the Rainbow.
Yeah, that is beautiful.  It scared me when I was little.
Really? What scared you about it?
The witch and the monkeys.  I thought they were real.
Yeah, I guess I could see that.  The witch was pretty spooky.
Especially when she melted.  I used to close my eyes during that part.
That's funny.  I always thought the munchkins were weird.
Yeah, they are a little bizarre.  It's based off a book, did you know that?
Yes, by Frank L. Baum I believe.
I think that's right.  There's so much Wizard of Oz memorabilia out now.
I know.  I saw a really cool music box.
Yeah, I've seen some neat stuff too.  I wonder what other movies Judy Garland was in?
I'm not sure.  I only remember her from the Wizard of Oz.
Did you ever see the follow up movie, The Land of Oz?
Is that what it was called? I think I saw it as a kid but I don't remember much about it.
Yeah, me too.  I remember liking it.
Yeah, I can't even remember if I liked it or not.
