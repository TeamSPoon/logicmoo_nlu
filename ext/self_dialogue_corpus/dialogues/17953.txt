I wonder if Fergie is ever going to release a solo album again.
You didn't hear about her newest album Double Dutchess?
No. What are you talking about?
She has a new album coming out this summer.
Really? I can't wait!
I know. I loved her single M.I.L.F. $.
So did I, but I never heard anything about a new album. I'm so excited now.
I can't believe it's been 11 years since her first album was released.
I know. It's crazy to think that The Dutchess came out in 2006!
That album had so many hits.
I know. I still love listening to Fergalicious and London Bridge.
Me too, and I loved her song Glamorous with Ludacris.
I haven't heard any of Ludacris' music in a long time.
Me either. He had that hit Runaway Love with Mary J. Blige out around the same time The Dutchess came out.
Oh, I remember that song. It was so sad.
I know, but it's so much more meaningful than some of his other songs.
Yeah. I can't stand any of the songs on his album Battle of the Sexes.
Me either. I think the only reason people liked them is because they had a good beat.
I will say that I did like all the collabs he had on that album.
You're right. That was a positive aspect of it, too.
