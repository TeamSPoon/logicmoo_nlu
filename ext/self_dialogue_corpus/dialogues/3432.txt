Are you in to classic films?
I like old horror movies.
What would you recommend?
To get starter? I would start with the classics, something like Dracula.
Is that anything like the new vampire movies?
Oh, no. It is a scary one, makes you jump and want to scream.
The Dracula Untold, that is a horror movie too right?
Yes, but not as scary as the original Dracula.
I seen the one with Keanu Reeves, Bram Stroker Dracula.
That one is a good remake of the classic horror one.
