Have you seen Beauty and the Beast?
I surely have. Classic movie.
Indeed it was. Do you know if it was hand-drawn? I don't think it was computer animated.
I'm not sure, but I'd say hand draw. Gorgeous illustration though.
Terrific music too. Who was your favourite character?
Oh, definitely Gaston. He reminds me of myself.
Ha! Hyper macho and manly?
You forgot 'devastatingly handsome.' I was rooting for him to win.
That's ridiculous. The Beast is so charming... personality issues aside.
I suppose. But Belle never did much for me either way.
