Have you seen that movie La La Land?
Yes, I saw it. Didn't think much of it. I really don't understand why everyone is raving about it.
Why didn't you like it?
Take Emma Stone's performance for example. She's not really all that great a singer, and for me it really ruined the movie.
That was all Emma singing throughout the whole movie though, no voice doubles. You have to admire that?
Why? Because the "It Girl" of the moment landed a role because she's popular, and not because she has talent?
It's all about popularity and selling movie tickets, you know that. Her voice was good enough.
That's just it. "Good enough" isn't good enough for me. When I watch a musical, I want to be wowed.
So who would wow you then?
Think of the great musicals of all time. The King and I, The Sound of Music, West Side Story ... CATS for goodness sakes?
CATS? Oh come on!
Obviously you've never seen CATS with Betty Buckley on stage singing, "Memory." If you had, you'd never forget her voice.
Okay but Betty Buckley is performing minor roles in horror movies now. I don't think her vocal chords are all that active anymore.
There's still Barbara Streisand.
So what other musicals do you recommend, if La La Land isn't so good?
Check out the 80's movie Labyrinth. David Bowie literally cries with his voice.
I know one! How about the remake of Annie?
No way, can't compare to the original. The kid can't sing in the new one. It's like a little girl singing in the shower. She can't hold a candle to Aileen Quinn in the original - I wonder if she still sings.
You're crazy. Anyway, La La Land won the Academy Award.
My point exactly.
