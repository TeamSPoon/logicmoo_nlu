Do you like the Harry Potter movies?
Sure! They're not as good as the books but they are still classics.
I know! I was disappointed in them as adaptations but I still love them.
Do you have a favorite?
I love the cinematography of the third one but I love that the last 2 got to go more in depth.
Yeah I hate that trend of splitting movies up but it worked well here.
I'm sad they cut out the scene of Harry in Dumbledore's office after Sirius' death
That was a really moving scene.
It was. I loved seeing Hogwarts come to life
Yes that was really breathtaking!
