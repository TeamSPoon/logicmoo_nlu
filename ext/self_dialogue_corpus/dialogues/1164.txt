Who do you think is the greatest QB ever.
Brady. Hands down.
What about montana
Was the best. Not anymore.
Why do you think brady is better.
5 super bowl wins.
well that is good
the best
montana didn't lose any
And didn't get to as many
That's true
Plus Brady did it with different talent around him all the time
True
Montana had the same talent
You're on point today
Plus montana got old at the end of his career
that he did
Brady is playing at a high level at his age
I still think montana is better
You're still wrong
