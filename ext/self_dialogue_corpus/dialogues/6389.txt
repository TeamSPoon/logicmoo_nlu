How do you feel about that "Coco" trailer?
Is that coming out this year?
Yeah, it's expected to be released on November 22nd.
Hmm... I don't have any strong opinions of it so far since it's so early.
That is true. But the cultural part of it is interesting.
Oh for sure. I think Disney is doing a good job on touching different perspectives.
I agree. It could be just me, but sometimes I feel like Disney movies correlate to specific politics.
Haha, really? What makes you think that?
Again, it could just be a coincidence but you know how Trump feels about Mexicans.
Ah, I can see why you feel this way.
