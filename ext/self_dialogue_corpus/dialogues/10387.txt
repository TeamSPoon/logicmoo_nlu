What are you up to this weekend?
No plans, why?
I was thinking of catching a movie.
Which one?
I'm not sure yet. What do you know about any in theaters?
I haven't really caught many trailers except...
Except what?
The trailer for Rough Night...
You seemed hesistant to say you've see that!
Yeah, because it looks like a dumb movie, but also could be a guilty pleasure!
I just wanna see it- I don;t care how dumb it ends up being!
Do you wanna go this weekend then!?
Yeah, totally!
Sweet, I'll look up times for the theater near me.
Is that the one that serves beer?
Obviously!
Nice! Yeah I'm definitely down for a girl's night and crazy movie!
How's Saturday sound?
Sounds good!
Great, I'll look up the times and text you!
