Have you seen the movie Mulan?
Yes I have, why?
Okay my question is, do you consider her a princess.
I've always categorized her as one.
Some people don't think she is and in technicality she isn't.
That's so strange, because she's know as one.
She's not of royal blood. She only becomes a soldier.
Well she becomes a warrior.
This is why I always ask because I love to hear people's opinions.
She becomes a warrior princess. She saves her country. She's definitely a princess.
