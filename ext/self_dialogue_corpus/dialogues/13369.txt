I can't wait until the next Star Wars that comes out in December.
Yes me too I can't wait to see how the story continues.
I wounder what they will do with Carrie Fishers part.
They will probably digitally alter the scenes.
I think that would work.
The movie is centered around Leia as she is at the end with C3PO and R2D2
That left you hanging for sure.
The part that I am most excited is about Mark Hamill.
Yes, Luke will play an important part in the next movie.
I thing it will have an impact on Rey's character.
