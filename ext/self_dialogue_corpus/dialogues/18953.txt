You like Zeppelin?
Zeppelin as in Led Zeppelin?
Yes.
Of course. They're the bomb.
Yeah, I like them to. What's your favorite album of theirs?
I really liked the first three albums. I really like Immigrant Song and Whole Lotta Love
Yeah, those are good ones. What about Stairway to Heaven.
Oh man, way overplayed. Not a fan.
What are you talking about it? It's the greatest rock song ever.
I beg to differ.
Come on, how could you not like Stairway.
Like I said, it's played way too much.
No way. It still holds up.
You know, I actually really liked D'Yer M'aker when I was growing.
I'm not familiar with that one.
It's the one that sounds kind of like a reggae rock piece.
Hmmm...still not ringing any bells.
You should go check it out.
Okay, I will
It's on House of Holies.
