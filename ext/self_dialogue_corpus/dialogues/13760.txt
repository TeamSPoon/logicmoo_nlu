Do you like Lady Gaga's newer stuff?
I think so. I actually don't know her new album at all though. What's it called?
Joanne.
That's her real name, isn't it.
Yeah, it is. Have you heard her song Million Reasons?
Yes! Is that on the newest album?
Yeah! I like how deep it is.
Yeah, it's a good song. But Paparazzi will always define her to me.
Well, of course! And Poker Face.
Yes! The Fame is such a fantastic album all the way around.
