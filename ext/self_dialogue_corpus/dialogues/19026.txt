Would you consider Creed the worst rock band around?
They arent around anymore I dont think
OK but of all time?
Yeah maybe but their album sales dont reflect that
Their music was so corny
I agree that it was but still, you cant really fault them for that.
I can, I think it was sort of boring for the most part.
They made commercial sounding songs
Higher was an anthem for awhile, you have to admit it was catchy at first.
I think the singer wanted to sound like Pearl Jam too much
You mean Eddie Vedder because none of their songs sound like Pearl Jam.
Yeah I would just say the singer specifically.
Nickelback was equally as terrible
Again they also sold a ton of albums
Do album sales in rock mean that much anymore?
Nowadays no but back in their day they do
What was the name of the song Nickelback
They had a ton but How You Remind Me was the one that broke them in
Yeah that song was terrible and I dont get its appeal
I can see it, had a very catchy chorus
