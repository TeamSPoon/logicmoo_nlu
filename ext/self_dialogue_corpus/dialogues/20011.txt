hey sleepy head,wake up.
am up already, just lying in bed listening  to the new weekend album
oyeah so you did cop that album
yeah i did yesterday
so what's it sounding like?any hot track other than "starboy"?
hmm couple of some i have listened to quite sounded nice
i love the weekend,though not enough to spend my money on his album
hahaha you love rnb music,so you should be a big weekend fan than i am,
not reallt,i just love few of his song like "earn it" and his recent song "starboy"
how about "plenty that was a great song too
oh that, i never loved it first time i heard it, sounded  too ragga for an rnb artist
maybe he was trying to appeal to his Caribbean fans i suppose
maybe though,but just don't do it for me.
he would be performing here in London at the 02 in a fourthnight.
would you be attending
don't know yet. would you have loved to attend?
i don't think so, but i have ticket for adele concert nextweek
no way, and you didn't say.
would have told you before sometime before the event, wanna join?
if you get me a ticket i won't say no hahaha
