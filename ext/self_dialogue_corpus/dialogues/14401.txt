So do the Celtics have any chance of taking a game from the Cavs?
I don't think so. Lebron seems driven to take this title as quickly as possible.
Yeah, they haven't lost a game these playoffs, have they?
No, and the Celtics have now dropped seven, so they've only saved themselves one game to rest.
They seem pretty run down.
They do have a decent bench.
They do. It's not as experienced as the Cavs, but probably just as good.
I wouldn't be surprised if Stevens finds some rotation scheme to make the last two games a bit more competitive.
If the outside shooters hit some shots at the beginning of a game, things could be different.
Olynyk needs to step up again for sure.
Bradley has been a bit off as well.
And even Thomas.
Tristan Thompson has been killing them on the glass early on as well.
Yes, for sure. Stevens doesn't have much in the way of a response for that available, though.
Perhaps he should start more energy guys.
He did Green already, who else?
Jaylen Brown?
True, he's been getting after the boards.
Getting the rookie some more hard playoff minutes might be the best they can salvage from this series now.
Yeah, and at least with games every other day, the series will be over soon and they can turn to the draft.
