hey have you seen any star wars movies lately?
yes, i loved them, im watching the older ones right now.
the ones with luke and leia?
yea, and han sollo and chewbacca
i love chewbacca, he acts sarcastic all the time.
i know right? so does r2d2.
yep, poor c3po, always trying to keep up with everyone.
he almost always gets himself into trouble.
especially when he was scrapped, and chewbacca tried to put him back together.
that was hilarious.
