Do you like music?
Of course I like music! Who doesn't?
Deaf people.
Fair enough. What type of music do you enjoy?
All types though my least favorite genres are rap, heavy metal, and dubstep. Always exceptions though.
I wasn't big into rap until I gave Eminem, Yelawolf, and Tupac another chance. Now I'm more open to it I guess.
I know what you mean and feel the exact same way about rap, but just cannot get into dubstep to save my life - outside of Skrillex and Deadmau5 at least.
Deadmau5 is alright. I like a handful of his songs.
So who else you listen to?
Have an hour?
Only if you do the same for me.
My absolute favorite bands or musicians at the moment are Goo Goo Dolls, Katy Perry, Nickelback, Kesha, and Pink. You?
That's a toughie. Of the more modern musicians probably... Avenged Sevenfold, Linkin Park, Green Day, Twenty-One Pilots, and Korn.
More modern?
Yeah... I've only recently gotten into post 2000 songs. Was raised on 70s and 80s mostly, and they're still among my absolute fave.
Oh really? Like whom?
Billy Idol, Billy Joel, ABBA, Buggles, Eagles, Beatles - of course, The Cure, The Doobie Brothers, etc etc.
Ah yes, can't beat the classics. I'm quite fond of The Doobie Brothers and Fleetwood Mac myself.
Shame most of these bands don't tour anymore... if they're still alive.
Yeah, but at least Billy Idol came through recently. That was an awesome show!
