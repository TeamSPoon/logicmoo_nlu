I really want to watch The Beauty and The Beast movie!
Me too! It is a great part of my childhood
I know, right? I mean, Emma Watson is my favorite actress! She is just amazing
Yes, and Belle character suits her perfectly
Maybe we could watch first the animated movie from 1991 and make a comparison of generations
That's a great idea, but I know I am going to love it
That's true, the story and the characters keep you amazed, don't forget the romanticism and the happy ending
Yes, and also the music and everything Belle has to do to find her prince
It is just lovely, we can go next saturday
Awesome! So we can connect ourselves with our inner children
