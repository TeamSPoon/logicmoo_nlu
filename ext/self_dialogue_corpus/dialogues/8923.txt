Do you like listening to Tool?
Yes I like their lyrics.
They have some of the best lyrics.
I couldn't agree more.
It is really worth reading their lyrics.
They are so good, I have never done that, I only listen.
Their songs mean more to me once I know every word.
OK thank you for the recommendation.
Are you going to read their lyrics.
Yes I am, I am looking forward to it.
