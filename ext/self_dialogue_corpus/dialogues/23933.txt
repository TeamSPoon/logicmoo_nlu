What is the last movie you saw in the theater?
Wonder Woman with Gal Gidot.
Did you like it?
I loved it.
Gal Gidot is so attractive.
For sure. Her acting wasn't the greatest.
No. It was still fun to watch though.
I like that they tried to be intersectional.
Yeah. It wasn't the greatest but at least they're getting better.
I also am in love with Robin Wright.
Yes. She is so bad ass in this movie.
I agree. I want her in more movies.
It's so sad how few movies pass the Bechdel test.
Maybe the success of this and Ghostbusters will make hollywood pay attention
Did you like ghostbusters?
Yes, but mostly for Kate McKinnnon?
What about Melissa McCarthy?
Yes. She's funny too.
I like the whole cast.
And the end was hilarious.
