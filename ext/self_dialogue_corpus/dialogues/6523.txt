When is Disney going to release "Song of the South"?
You mean on DVD? I don't know - it might make people angry.
How can it make you angry? It is such a beautiful film.
Don't get me wrong - I'm a fan. But it comes off as pretty racist.
Disney has released other movies that can come off as racist as well. Just look at Peter Pan.
I guess in their mind acceptability of racism depends on race.
I am partly a fan of the movie because Splash Mountain is my favorite ride.
I would bet there are people out there riding that ride who don't even know it's based on a movie.
I think you are right. In fact, I think most people don't know.
That's sad to me. "Zipadeedoodah" is so much fun.
