Okay, comedies. Will we ever get a good one again?
Every year someone says "no really, ____ was good." I go to see it and its stale garbage.
Hah, I know the feeling. Doesn't matter who is starring.
The problem is that the main people churning them out are just stale. Feig, Apatow, anything with Seth Rogen.
I'm with you there. But even the indie scene has been a failure recently!
The last good comedy I saw was The Overnight.
Wasn't crazy about it, though I did laugh.
We need another Obvious Child, In Another World, and so on. Just, something
It's possible that the best comedies are being made elsewhere. I need to check outside the US
Good call. I can't stomach another raunchy crap fest
