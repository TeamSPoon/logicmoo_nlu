What kind of movies do you like?
I don't really watch many movies, to be honest.
Really?
Yeah I just don't have a lot of extra time these days.
Do you have Netflix?
I do, why?
You should at least check out some of the documentaries on there, even if you don't use it for movies!
I have actually seen a few!
Awesome, which ones?
Princess of Versailles was a really interesting one.
Yeah, that was good! Definitely fascinating. What other ones have you seen?
Honestly I can't think of any?
I think I've seen every documentary on Netflix!
Really?
Yeah, especially anything having to do with politics.
Oh I actually did see one recently about North Korea.
Do you remember what it was called?
I don't, but it was crazy!
I'll have to look it up when I got home, it actually doesn't sound familiar!
I thought you'd seen them all!
