Hi
Hey there.
You doing okay today?
Yeah sure you?
Yep, no complaints.
That's good.
What kind of music are you into?
I like a lot of the older stuff.
Oh yeah, like what?
Like a bunch of old soul, r and b, that kind of thing.
Oh I see, I like some of that stuff too.
I love listening to it, it takes me back.
Yeah I can see that.
I have a bunch of vinyl records from back then.
I love listening to stuff on vinyl.
Yeah me too.
There's nothing quite like that.
Yeah it gives you a certain feel with the crackling and popping.
Good talking to you.
You too.
