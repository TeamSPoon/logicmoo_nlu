Has your favorite type of music changed over the years?
It has definitely changed. Yours?
Yes, I used to be into pop music.
Really? That doesn't seem like you at all!
I know. I loved Backstreet Boys.
Wow, that's hillarious!
I'm sure you had some equally embarassing music choices.
I did!
Tell me!
I loved "hair metal" music.
Like who?
Stuff like Motley Crue, Poison, and the others.
That's good music, though.
True, and I also liked Backstreet Boys.
I knew it!
Yes, but N'Sync is better!
No, it's Menudo!
Yes, they are classic. But, you can't forget New Kids on the Block.
You know what? We should organize a boy band festival!
That would be a lot of fun!
