Do you like Radiohead?
I'm not sure. Who are they?
This rock band from the UK.
What songs are they known for?
Have you heard the song Creep?
How does it go?
"I'm a creep, I'm a loser, what the hell am I doing here..."
Hmmm, that sounds familiar.
Yeah, it was one of their early hits in the 90s
Well, that was a long time ago. Anything more recent?
I guess their music recently hasn't had big hits. They're more of an album kind of band.
OK, what albums do you reccommend?
I think OK Computer is a great place to start. That was their groundbreaking album in 1997.
What's that like?
It's got great songs like Karma Police. But the sound is getting more experimental, less poppy, more epic.
That's pretty interesting. What else?
Their latest album is A Moon Shaped Pool. I like it but it's not super catchy.
Hmmm, I should give it a listen. What other bands sound like that?
Maybe Alt-J?
Cool. Thanks
