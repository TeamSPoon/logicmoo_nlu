How do the warriors pay all of these players?
You know, I've been wondering that.
They have so many good players. How do they fit under the cap?
I dont know. Iguodala is still very well paid.
You know what I think they did?
What did they do? What do you think?
They signed these players before the contacts increased?
Oh so before Timofey Mizgov became a billionaire?
And before Evan Turner made as much money as Stephen Curry.
Yea, what a great world that was.
Whatever the case is, the Warriors are really good!
Thats for sure. Are you hoping they get taken down?
I sure am! I would even prefer Lebron over them.
Me too. At least he doesn't have a superteam.
Yea, I agree. He actually has to play his best to win.
Yea and he seems to play his best nightly.
That is true. He is one heck of a player.
It will be in interesting finish for sure.
Yes, whats your pick?
Warriors over Cavs in 6.
