Don't you think that Lennon/McCartney are prolific song writers?
Yes, I think they and the Beatles are the best musicians of the 20th century.  Do you have a favorite song?
All My Loving and a Hard Day's Night are two of my favorites.
Yes, and the movie Hard Day's Night was great too.
I remember watching that movie with John, Paul, Ringo, and George in a theater downtown when I was a kid.
I prefer their early music like Love Me Do and when they performed on Ed Sullivan.
While I like Sgt. Pepper's just fine, I still like their early music too.
How do you feel about later performances when it was just Paul McCartney?
I think his live concerts are great, especially when he sings Yesterday.
That song is great!
