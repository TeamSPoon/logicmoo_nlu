Have you seen Big Daddy?
The Adam Sandler movie?
That's the one from the 2000's I think.
Yes I have why do you ask?
Do you like the story of it?
Well I enjoyed it and the story yet.
Can you explain further?
I love how he had this kid dumped in his lap and then fell in love with him, he also had no idea what he was doing.
That's a good point.
I also liked how it portrays what it's like as a parent trying to make the right decisions for your kid all the time.
True, it can be difficult and parents make mistakes all the time.
Yep, just like the everyone else.
I think the kid did a fantastic job acting his character.
I thought so too, he played the part well.
Do you think that kid made anymore movies?
That I do not know.
Do you remember the scene where he told him to write his name on the wall?
With his urine, that's a classic scene.
Yeah it was funny because I remember my mom telling me to go do that on a tree once.
I never had that experience myself.
