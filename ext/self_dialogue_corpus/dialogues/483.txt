Who is your favorite football player?
I like Tom Brady.
Really.
Yes, why do you not?
No.  I do not care for him at all.
What is your issue with him?
I think he acts like a baby.
That is true.
So you agree.
I agree with how he acts but still a great player.
He is a good player.
Who is your favorite?
I am a fan of Antonio Brown.
He is good.
Heck yes, very fast.
Yes he is.
I am excited for the season to start.
Me as well.
Ready to watch some games.
I hear you there.
