How did you enjoy Rogue One?
It was great! I can see why everyone recommended it.
A lot of people were worried that Jyn Erso was going to be a bad copy of Han Solo, but she wasn't, right?
No, and I liked how her values never quite aligned with anyone else's, even as she was fighting so hard for their cause.
I was so sad at the ending. I mean, it was perfect, but I loved those characters.
I would watch a movie just about Chirrut and Baze.
So would I! I wanted to know more about their temple.
I would sit and watch those two banter about anything.
It was kind of cool realizing that there were probably all sorts of force-sensitive people around going without training.
Maybe there were pseudo-Jedi enclaves springing up everywhere!
