Did you like the cast for beauty and the beast movie?
I love Emma Watson, so it's a yes for me.
I know, she was a great choice.
Also, Ariana Grande sang really well the main soundtrack!
Totally agree, the duet was even more special with John Legend
I have to admit that i had my doubts with that duet but it turned out just great.
The technology to create the beast in the movie was amazing also.
Disney live movies are beginning to seem more interesting every time.
Well, today is the second time i'm going to watch the movie, want to come with us?
Sure!
