So, something has been bothering me about Rey in the Force Awakens.
I really like that one, I like where they're going with the new franchise.
I like it, too, but I'm still bothered by the fact that a girl who spends her time scavenging for parts in wrecked Emperial ships conveniently know how to operate and repair the Millennium Falcon.
Well, she spent her whole life in starships, so she would have learned firsthand.
Yeah but that doesn't make her a top notch pilot that can keep up with the likes of Han Solo.
She must have learned from Unkar Plutt, the guy who stole the Millennium Falcon.
It just seems weird, the same guy who was willing to let her starve and who turned her over to the First Order also took the time to teach her how to pilot a plane?
She worked for him, it showed that her family left her with him in that flashback.
Then why was he willing to let her go hungry if she didn't give him enough parts?
Just because she was left with him doesn't mean that he's kind, but she knew that he had added a compressor so obviously he had been teaching her about the workings of a starship.
