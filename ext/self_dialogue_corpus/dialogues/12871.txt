Did you ever watch the first trilogy back in the 80's I think it was.
Yeah but not at first.
Did you like the story plot?
I did actually I thought it was well done.
Yeah Luke getting learning how to control his powers It had all the iconic members like Yoda and more.
Like Vader the emperor Obi-Won so many awesome characters.
Yep and we got to learn about them the first time.
Yoda did the best job though.
He did do a good job playing the old wise guy.
I agree.
