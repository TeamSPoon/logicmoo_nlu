What did you think of the Star Wars prequel trilogy? To me, it was disappointing
I had a similar first impression, but I've seen them a few times now, and I have to admit they're a lot of fun.
But there are some glaring flaws. How about Jar Jar - isn't he annoying?
Yes, he is, but you have to look at the big picture. Lucas obviously included him for a bit of humor.
That's the problem, though. He's not funny - he's just annoying.
Jar Jar aside, some of the characters are very compelling. Qui Gone Jin, for example, played by Liam Neisen, is amazing.
I have to agree with you there. He's a good example of a courageous, strong-willed Jedi. And Darth Maul is a terrific villian too.
Yeah, how about the fight between the two Jedi and Darth maul with the double light saber? There's nothing like it.
That's true. It ranks among the best ever Star Wars combat scenes. But Haydn Christianson was miscast as Anakin Skywalker.
There I agree with you. They could have chosen a better actor for that part.
