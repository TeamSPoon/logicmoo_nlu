I just binge watched the original three Star Wars movies yesterday.
Really? I think the best of the original three is Empire Strikes back.
No way! Return of the Jedi is the best.
I like parts of Jedi but I think the Ewoks are just dumb.
But they're so cute, I had the whole Ewok village playset when I was a kid.
That's just it, if you saw the movie for the first time when you were an adult the Ewoks just seem so lame.  Suddenly they're on a planet hanging out with teddy bears, it just doesn't make sense.
Oh OK, a giant Wookie is totally fine with you but smaller, cuter ones are stupid?
Well, you are able to get past the weirdness of Chewbacca because he's huge and really tough.
The Ewoks have a complete culture and language, Chewie only ever howls like a dog with his foot caught in a trap.
Yeah, but the bowcaster and the fact that he can rip your arms off if he gets mad totally make up for all that.
