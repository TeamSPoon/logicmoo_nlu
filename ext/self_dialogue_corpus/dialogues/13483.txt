What is your favorite Star Wars scene?
I'm going to have to go with, "Luke, I am your Father."
Really?
Yeah. What a great plot twist.
True. It almost made up for the movie being so boring.
You didn't like Empire Strike Back?
No. Return of the Jedi is my favorite.
That was a good one. But mine is still A New Hope.
Very excellent film, but not my favorite.
Who knows, maybe there'll be a new favorite in the next trillogy.
