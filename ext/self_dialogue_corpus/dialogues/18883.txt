I think Pink Martini is coming to play in town.
Do you want to go see them?
Kind of.  They are playing with the symphony orchestra.
That should be interesting.
It's funny, but I didn't know they were that popular or well known.
I didn't either.  I never hear their music on the radio.
I really love the one song that they do.
Which one?
I'll have to look it up.
Only if it isn't too much trouble.
It's called "Let's never stop falling in love."
Which album is it from?
The "Hang on little tomato" album.
Interesting, I'll have to look that one up.
I think you will like it.  It has a very retro vibe to it.
Okay.  Thanks for the recommendation.
Sure.  I love finding new music.
Where do you usually go to find new music?
Sometimes I'll hear things on a news program about up and coming artists.
That's a good idea.  Support new talent.
