Did you like the Beatles music?
Yeah, of course.  Who doesn't?
Do you prefer their earlier stuff or later?
I don't know.  It depends on my mood.
I understand.  Their later stuff is much deeper.
Exactly.  If I'm in a more cheerful mood, the earlier stuff.
Yeah, that makes sense.  What's your favorite earlier stuff?
I still like "All My Loving" I think.
Yeah, that one's good.
I guess it's kind of common.
