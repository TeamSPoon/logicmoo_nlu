How do you feel about the Lady Gaga and Tony Bennet duo album?
I think it was great for her career
Yeah I think she gained fans through it
I think she did it on purpose.
To gain a bigger audience
That was my exact reasoning
Her vocals were so good on the album though
I would have loved to see a Bad Romance re-do with both of them
I would be scared to hear him sing that.
Yeah it would be slowed down for sure.
