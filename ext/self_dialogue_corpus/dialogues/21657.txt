Have you seen Hidden Figures?
No, I saw it was on Netflix, should I watch it?
Yes! everyone is so good. The performances are top notch
Is it as good as the book?
Yes, a rare time the movie is as good as the book
Kevin Costner is in it right?
Yes, but Octavia Spencer steals the show.
Taraji Henson is in it too right?
Yes! and she is the complete opposite of her character on Empire
I should see it right away
You know who else is in it? Kristen Dunst
No way! I loved her in Bring It On
Yep, it's weird to see her all grown up
Who else is in it?
That guy from the Big ang Theory
Sheldon?
Yes, but is kind of a villain in the movie
That sounds like an amazing cast
It really is. Also the set design and costumes are cool
Thanks! I really need to watch it now!
