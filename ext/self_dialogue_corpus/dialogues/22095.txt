Have you heard they are making another Indiana Jones movie?
Really, I didn't think the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull did that well.
It actually did well at the box office, but it was not received well by the critics.
Did you see it?
Yes, I saw it in the theater. It wasn't perfect, but I would watch another one.
Me too. Harrison Ford is such a strong actor, he can carry anything.
He is getting a bit old for action roles. Don't you think?
He did his own stunts for the Force Awakens.
True, but I thought his age was showing quite a bit. He seemed tired.
That's probably because he broke his leg early in filming. I think he still has some action movies left to film.
What? He broke his leg? How did that happen?
I think the door of the Millennium Falcon closed on it. He had to take some time off before he could finish filming.
Well I guess it turned out well. Maybe not so much for Han Solo. I wonder if he will make it through another Indiana Jones movie.
They could try to pass the torch to a younger actor, but I don't think they would kill him off.
Maybe he could be the elder adventurer, like Sean Connery was in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.
I could see him doing that very easily.
It would be a better idea that trying to replace him. I don't think another actor could play that role.
What about Jason Statham?
What? No, way! Are you serious?
Not really. That would be a whole different kind of Indiana Jones movie!
