So i was reading that Jamis Winston could break some touvhdown ecords this season.
Really? What did the article say?
Well, he's thrown 50 already in his 3 year career so far.
Wow, i didnt know that
Yeah, so now to beat Josh Freeman's franchise mark of 80 he only needs 31.
31?
Yes, basically 2 touchdowns per game and 1 in playoffs.
Well, that's easier said than done.
I know, he's only 23 too.
Really? just 23?
Yeah, amazing, eh?
No kidding, he's really running up the numbers playing for Tampa.
Keep in mind this is a franchise record, he would need to rack up 136 to beat Can Newton.
Ah, i see.
Also he's working on beating a passing record as well.
Really?
Yes, this could really be a season for Jamis
It would bew heartbreaking for him to break these records and not make the playoffs.
I know, this happened last season, there were a lot of numbers surpassed by the bucs but meant nothing because they didnt get to the playoffs.
I remember. That was sad.
