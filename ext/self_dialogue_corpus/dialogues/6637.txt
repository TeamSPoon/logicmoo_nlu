When does Zootopia 2 release?
I don't know. I'm not sure they're even making another Zootopia.
What? Why wouldn't they?
I don't know, I'm not a movie expert. Maybe they just haven't got around to it yet.
They need to make another one. I thought it was a clever movie.
It was okay. I like Officer Hops.
Did you know there were over 60 different species in Zootopia?
No I didn't. where did you read?
I read it on Disney's website. They have a lot of fun facts like that.
That's interesting, I'll check it out. I wonder what else is on there.
