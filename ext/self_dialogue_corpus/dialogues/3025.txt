How good do you think Denver will be this year.
I think they can bounce back this season.
Think they can win 10 games.
I do,but it might not get them into the playoffs.
They have a tough schedule.
Yes,very tough.
They start out with chargers and then the cowboys.
They should beat the chargers and they're home with the cowboys.
Then buffalo and the raiders.
Could be a 2-2 start.
Week five is a bye.
That's an early bye week.
Yes it is.
Then the Giants come to Denver.
Another tough game.
Then the chargers again and then the chiefs,eagles and New England.
Wow,they do have a tough schedule.
They finish with Cincinnati,Oakland,Miami,jets,colts,redskins and chiefs again l
Ten wins will be tough.
Yes,very tough.
