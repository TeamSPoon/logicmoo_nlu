Have you seen Moana?
I haven't. Isn't it a kid's movie?
It is, but I loved it too. There is some great  mythology in it.
Really? What?
Maui, the demigod.
He was really from Polynesian myth?
Yes. And all the symbols were great too.
Like what?
The fishhooks. I saw a lot of those in jewelry when we were in New Zealand.
That's interesting. I will have to check it out.
