Soon we get to see how good the SeaHawks have been practicing in the off season!
I know, I am extremely excited!  Are you?
Yes, Very excited to see the Hawks kick some butt!
You think so?  I am not sure they will be as good this year?
I believe they will be all the more better!
We shall see.  How bout Lynch this year?
Lynch is ok, but I will be rooting for a different team all together this year.
Really?  Which team?
I am going for the Packers this time around.
Really?  Any player in particular?
I am not sure.
I think Tim Tee-bow will do good this year.
Tee-bow really?
Yes.
Oh ok.  I was thinking maybe someone from the Chicago Bears, like Kyle Long or Zach Miller.
Da Bearz!  Haha.  Love that Saturday Night Live Skit!
The Bears is right.
Why do you think the Bears will be winning this year
They had a good track record last seas
