Did you ever see Fight Club?
Did I? That's one of my favorite movies ever, it's so clever.
The writing is great, the plot, the dialogue, everything.
They even had a great twist at the end.
Finding out that he was actually Tyler Durden, Brad Pitt's character, must have been a shock for him.
Right because he was basically his exact opposite.
I believe he was a mix of all his suppressed desires.
Right, Tyler was everything he wanted to be but was afraid to.
It's amazing how our subconscious works. This movie does a great job of walking us through that type of mental illness.
First rule of Fight Club: We don't talk about Fight Club.
