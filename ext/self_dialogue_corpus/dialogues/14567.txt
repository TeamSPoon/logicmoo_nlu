Good morning.
Hello.
How are you.
Well, you?
Fine.  Do you like basketball?
Yes I do.
Do you have a team you like?
I like the Hoosiers.
Oh college, cool.
Yeah I don't care for the NBA very much.
That's okay.
College is more exciting to me.
I like the NBA myself, better skill on show.
I get that, but I think College means more.
I see.
Also, nothing like March Madness.
I do love March Madness.
You can't beat it for excitement.
True.
Bye.
