Remember when Creed was huge?
It was a bad time in rock music
Higher was such a huge hit
But it was not good
I dont know alot of people liked it.
It always amazes me how album sales means a band is good
Why would people buy bad music
I dont know look at Creed
They havent done anything new
Yeah and thats my point they didnt have hits outside of Higher.
