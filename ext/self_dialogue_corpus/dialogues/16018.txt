What are you listening to these days?
I have bee just using google play for music lately.
Well what on google play are you listening to?
I pick a mix that suits my mood for the moment.
So you aren't listening to a particular artist?
No really. I enjoy the variety more.
Sort of like radio I guess.
It's better because there are so few commercials.
I know. I really can't stand radio commercials these days.
It really takes away from my enjoyment of listening to music to hear a loud ad for mattresses or something.
Maybe you should buy into one of those paid services for no ads then.
I was thinking of it but they are so expensive.
What do they cost, about $10 a month right?
More like $15. Consider how Netflix is $20 a month, then you realize what a bad deal that is.
If you want no commercials, your alternative is to download music.
I have been doing that more actually. It is a bit tedious though.
Legally or the immoral way?
A mix of both. I find in my older age I have been buying music more.
About a decade and a half too late to save the music industry though.
I'm sure the music and musicians will be just fine.
