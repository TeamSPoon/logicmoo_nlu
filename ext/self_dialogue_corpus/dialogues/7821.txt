I can't believe we'll never have a new Harry Potter film.
I know. I get so depressed thinking about it.
I grew up with Harry, Ron, and Hermione.
I know what you mean. I was always the same age as the actors, so I literally felt like I grew up with them.
Same here. I miss seeing Snape and Dumbledore too.
It's hard to believe Alan Rickman passed away. He was the perfect Snape.
I try not to think about it. Which was your favorite film in the series?
I always loved Goblet of Fire.
Me too! But I think my favorite is Order of the Phoenix.
I agree. Those two were seriously the best out of all of them.
