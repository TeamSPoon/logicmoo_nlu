Do you like Captain America?
It is good.
I like Winter Soldier sequel better.
It is a better movie.
But the origin of the hero is interesting.
I like that too.
I like how he transformed into a muscular hero from a weakling.
They chose him for his intergrity.
He was a good person.
He always considered others.
