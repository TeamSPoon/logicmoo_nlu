I heard this song on the elevator at work today and I think you might like it
Oh yeah what kind of song is it
You know one of them Slow Love type songs
Oh I do like those type of songs Who's the artist
Thank is Ed Sheridan
Oh I heard of him he sings a lot of songs I like what song did you hear on the elevator
I think it was called shape of you because he kept saying in the lot
I don't think that's his song don't you think that's by Bruno Mars
I don't know you can look it up
Yeah I just looked it up you was right this by him
I like the part in the song where he's like I love with the shape of you
That's all he says throughout the whole song he said that at least 10 20 times
Well duh that's what this song is called
Have you ever read the lyrics for that song
No why you ask
Did you look at the lyrics all I was saying is that one line over and over and over
Now I know you joking I know he says more than that in the song
Oh he does he says I'm in love with your body
All he says it's those two lines I'm in love with the shape and I'm in love with your body
Yep go look at the lyrics
