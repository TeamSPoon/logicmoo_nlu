Would it be cheaper to film a movie abroad?
If it was more movie sets would be filmed outside the US
I mean I think they do some scenes internationally
Right but most films are shot on sets.
I think there has to be tax reasons for that.
Well California has the highest taxes in the country
That doesnt scare off directors.
I think we see films shot all over.
Some cities are so used to it.
Yeah New York City and Los Angeles are set up for it.
But when you go to other cities the film process almost shuts them down.
I think you can create a city landscape right on a set.
Its crazy to think we are being deceived.
I dont see it as deception this is just the process used in film making.
I would like to see an entire film shot and not edited.
We are all humans thats not possible.
Yeah but dont you want to see the naturalness of a film shot in one take.
No I think thats why we pay for films like we do.
Its just an alternative movie process thats all.
One that will have no weight in todays place
