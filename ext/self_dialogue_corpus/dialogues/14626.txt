Have been watching the Celtics Wizards series
Yea it's been awesome so fa
yes very physical both teams just don't like each other
I know one player from the wizards was suspended for a game for starting a fight
he should have be suspended for the series
The home court advantage has been unreal
yes no road victory so far for either team
The scoring streaks have been off the charts
yea the wizards ran off 26 straight in game four
And then the celtics came back and won the next game
I know go figure, two games left who do you want to win
I the the wizards are dirty players so I'm pulling for Boston
Yea me too but the next game is in washington
maybe it  will be the first road win
could be but I doubt it the way things have been going so far
I agree it's more hope than a prediction
I know what you mean but the final game is back in bean town
that should send the celtics to the finals in the east
But look who they have to play next
Cleveland will crush either team.
