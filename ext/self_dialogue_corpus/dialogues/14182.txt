How tall is lady gaga?
She is only 5'1''. Very short.
I thought she looked short but hard when she is often wearing crazy heels.
Alejandro is my favorite song, what about you?
Bad romance or poker face.
Bad romance was on the album fame monster with Alejandro.
Ya that was an awesome album.
I don't think she has had a bad one ever!
Probably very true. each seems to have at least a few mega hits.
Exactly not a bad one... yet anyways.. and doubtful to be one in the future either.
