So Joe, did you ever see the first film Clint Eastwood directed, Play Misty for Me?
Yes I did. It's a strange one for a thriller, but it does draw you in.
It's not that strange, it's a psychological thriller, like Shutter Island or Silence of the Lambs.
In this case, Marsha, it's the deranged fan who needs psychological help. She's sooo demented.
But the hero wasn't thinking straight either. Why did he sleep with her if he didn't want her around?
Do I really have to explain that to you?
Uh, no, thanks, but remember Fatal Attraction? Straying is dangerous in movies, and in real life, too, believe me.
So the movie really doesn't have a hero. He's not heroic, for sure.
Well he does try to let her down gently.
Yeah, but she ends up taking a hard fall. Of course, it could just as easily have been him.
