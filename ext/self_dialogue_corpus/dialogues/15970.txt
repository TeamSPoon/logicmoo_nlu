Are you familiar with the various periods of classical music?
No. What do you mean by a "period"?
Classical music spans about 400 years. The music of each century sounds very different from the others.
I imagine so. So there are four periods?
The classical repertoire, unless you're including early music from before the 16th century, has 5 periods.
What are they?
They are the Baroque, the classical, the romantic, the post-romantic, and the modern.
There is a classical period of classical music?
Yes. It's probably not the best name for it, but it has stuck for some reason. That's the music of the 18th century.
Would I have heard of any composers from that century?
Have you heard of Mozart?
Yes, of course. Why are there 5 periods for 4 centuries of music?
The 20th century was influenced by radical movements of avante garde and expressionist thought, so the music of the latter half of the century was very different from the earlier half.
So the 21st century has 2 periods -- the post romantic and the modern?
That's correct.
Which period has the best music?
That's mostly a matter of taste. A lot of people say that Bach was the greatest composer, even though he is from the 16th century.
That's weird.
On the other hand, most of the most well-known composers, like Beethoven and Tchaikovsky, are from the Romantic period.
Interesting.
