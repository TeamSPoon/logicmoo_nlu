Have you seen the Labyrinth?
I don't think so what's it about?
It has David Bowie in it and he is the goblin king!
The Goblin King?
Yes it's a fantasy movie about a girl who creates an alternate reality of her own.
Sounds interesting.  Wasn't there another labyrinth movie out recently?
Guillermo Del Toro did one called pan's labyrinth.  It wasn't quite as whimsical.
I heard about that one, it's pretty dark to my understanding.
Yes it doesn't have a happy ending.
The only thing I didn't like about it is the subtitles.
Wow subtitles. I don't know if i would enjoy that.
There isn't a lot of dialogue so it wasn't that bad.
It's hard to watch movies with subtitles but sometimes it's worth it.
I don't know how the silent movie era patrons did it.
I wonder if they were annoyed when the talkies came along.
Maybe it was annoying to hear someone talking instead of reading.
So much has changed in the last 60 years in cinema.
Yes it has.
Just think how different things will be in another 60 years.
Scary to think about really!
