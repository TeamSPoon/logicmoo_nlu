Who is your favorite female superhero?
Easy: Black Widow from Marvel.
Wrong, again.
How do you mean?
She's not a superhero. She's just a human with really good gun and fighting abilities.
She can even take out a room of guys by herself, and choke them out with her legs.
I can do that too!
You can?
Yup, and I'm not super. Try again.
How about Wonder Woman?
You're just saying her because the movie just came out. Try again.
How about...?
You're just naming the first person you can think of. Think harder before you speak.
Okay, I like Jean Grey.
Why is that?
She's pretty much the most powerful mutant out there but has a major flaw.
What's her flaw?
She has a split personality so she's hard to control
You just want women to be controlled?
No, no, you're reading into it. Superheros are best when they have a flaw that can be exploited against them to make them more human.
