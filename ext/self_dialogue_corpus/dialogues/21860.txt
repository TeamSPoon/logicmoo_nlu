Do you like Pulp Fiction?
I love it! I love crazy and interesting movies.
That's my favorite Tarantino film. Along with Reservoir Dogs.
I never saw Reservoir Dogs but I loved Kill Bill.
Do you prefer volume I or volume II
Volume I of course, that's where all the action is.
Yeah the best part of volume II was the Pei Mei training scene.
Did you know Tarantino was originally going to act the part of Pei Mei, but had Gordon Liu do it instead.
Oh that would have been hilarious!
Tell me about it. Did you ever see his half of the Grindhouse movie that he did with Robert Rodriguez?
Death Proof right? Yes I saw it and it was incredible.
He's so talented. And as much as I love Tarantino, I liked Rodriguez' Planet Terror better.
You're a big horror fan?
Love horror. Of course the 80s had the best horror.
What's your favorite classic horror movie?
That has to be Texas Chainsaw Massacre.
Part 1 or any of the sequels.
I don't like the sequels but part 1 was fantastic.
I heard that was based on a true story.
Well I live in Texas and I heard the same thing, loosely based on the case of Ed Gein.
