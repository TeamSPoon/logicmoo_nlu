Did you know that Mike Ditka used to play and coach the Chicago Bears?
Really, no I didn't.
I just found that out.
Do you remember the skits they used to do on Saturday Night Live?
They were pretty funny.
Da Bears. Ditka could do no wrong.
Chicago Bears were a part of a lot of shows.
Really. I didn't know that.
Yes, big fans on T.V. shows like Married with Children.
Jay Cutler is a great player on that team.
He is.
In the fourties they beat the Redskins 73-0.
Wow, what a killer game.
Wish I could've seen that one.
I wonder how that team will be this year.
Don't know. It's a lot of chance on teams parts if you ask me.
You're right. Anything can happen in a game..
Seems good players get hurt a lot too.
Well, let's keep an eye on the Bears.
I know I will.
