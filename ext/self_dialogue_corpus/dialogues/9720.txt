I heard Remy Ma dissed Nicki Minaj.
She did, on a track called Sheether.
Is that a sly reference to Ether?
It is, but I wouldn't say it's as clever.
What's it like?
Well, it's really bald and the lyrics are blunt. She was not playing around.
It seems everybody is coming for Nicki these days.
Well when you get that high on the charts, somebody is gonna gun for your spot.
That's true. Same thing happened to Lil' Kim.
And even she has come for Nicki!
