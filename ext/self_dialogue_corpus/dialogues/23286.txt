I have a horrible Star Wars theory.
I love horrible things. Go ahead.
It's about Rey's parents.
Who do you think they are?
Luke and Leia.
WHAT??? Oh my god that's horrible!
Told you. It explains a lot.
Go ahead, what does it explain?
Well, they obviously had sex during episodes IV-V, before Leia got with Han. Gotta do something for those long hyperspace flights.
Okay, so the timeline works out. But why was she left on Jakku?
She's a shame-child. They had no idea they were brother and sister at the time, just that they had a connection.
So what about Han?
They probably convinced Han it was his ... or Rey and Ben are siblings.
Hmm, okay.
Also, having Rey would destroy Leia's career, and Luke's Jedi credibility
Yeah, it sure would.
And that's why they dropped her off on Jakku.
It also explains the "Crap. She found me" look on Luke's face at the end of VII.
Ha, now you're onto it. It also explains how quickly she harnessed The Force.
I'm not sold as Disney would never go with it. But, it's intriguing.
