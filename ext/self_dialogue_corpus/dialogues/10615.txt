Did you see all of the Fast & Furious movies?
I have seen most of them.
Which ones have you not watched?
I did not see Toyko drift or 2 Fast 2 Furious
But you saw all the other ones?
Yes. I know it is odd to jump them like that but oh well.
Do you think they should have continued on after Paul Walker passed away?
I think that finishing the movie they were making was the right thing to do.
How many more do you think they will make?
Who knows! As long as they keep making money!
