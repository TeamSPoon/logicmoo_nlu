Do you like Abba?
I do! So many of their songs are still great today.
True.  They are like the Bee Gees you know what I mean?
Yep. That's another group that is still great.
What's your favorite song?  My Abba favorite is Fernando.
Let's see, I think my Abba favorite is Chiquita.
My Bee Gees favorite is Tragedy.
Oh, I like that one!  My Bee Gees favorite is How Deep is your Love.
That's one of my favorites too!  I like More than a Woman also.
Stayin' Alive is a great one.
Did you see Barry Gibb on the awards show recently?
I did. It's weird to see him so old.
They should do a tribuite to Abba.
They really should.  It would be easy to pick the great songs to do.
Money, Money, Money, would be perfect for nowadays!
I totally agree!  Do you think anyone is as good as Abba, I mean as talented nowadays?
I don't know.  Abba had great harmony.
They really did.  It was real too, not synthesized like so many today.
I know.  I feel like playing some Abba this morning!
Me too! I think I'll start with Chiquita!
