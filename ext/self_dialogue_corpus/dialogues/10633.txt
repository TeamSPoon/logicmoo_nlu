Do you thing the Rock and Vin love eachother?
Like, more than Vin loved Paul?
Yeah man!
Really?
Heck yeah! You know they both love fast cars and pumping iron.
That's true.
When they're not busying stealing cars and getting into trouble, they probably like to camp and stuff.
Like camp at the beach or something?
Sure, beach, mountains, jail cell...
ha ha ha
