I want to jam to some tunes play some i am down for it right now
Well what do you want to jam to
I want something filled with atmosphere.
Their is quite a bit of music that is like that gotta give me more
Something that feels like nature you know
That gives me some more ideas go on
I like to jam with something with low production and stuff that is just natural
Okay i got the thing
What can we jam to?
We can jam to some Mayhem that sound good
That sounds perfect what album you got in mind to play
i am thinking of a few to be honest
Well lets go pick one then
Okay lets play some Esoteric Warfare
That will be an awesome album to jam to lets get started
This is gonna be awesome
Most definitely i love this album it is just atmospheric and raw
I love the mix it sounds awesome
The mix is likely the best thing
I think music is to produced now a days to be honest.
