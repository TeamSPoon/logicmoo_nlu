It's such a shame that the Joe Dirt sequel wasn't as funny as the first one.
I know. The first one is so funny.
David Spade always makes me laugh.
One of his more underrated movies is Dickie Roberts: Former Child Star.
I'll have to see that one some time.
You really should. Another great movie he starred in is Tommy Boy.
I totally agree. It's so weird seeing how young he looks in that movie.
Oh I know, and his character is such a buzz kill.
Yep, Chris Farley's character definitely contrasted with David Spade's.
I think the interactions and relationship between their characters is what makes the movie so memorable and lovable.
