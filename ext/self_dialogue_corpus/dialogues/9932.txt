Who was the guy that had the Baby Got Back song?
Sir Mixalot?
Yeah, I couldn't remember his name!  Did he have any other songs?
I remember a couple, but I don't know if it's because my cousins would play his tape nonstop.
What other songs do you remember?
Posse on Broadway was probably the biggest one.
I think I kind of remember that one.  What were the other ones?
I remember Put Em on the Glass and Buttermilk Biscuits.
Seriously?  There's a song called Buttermilk Biscuits?
Yes, and it sounded awesome.
