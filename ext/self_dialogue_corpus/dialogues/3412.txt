What is your favorite horror movie?
I think I'd have to say Saw.
Saw is a good movie.
Yes, its freaky and awesome.
Its crazy how the guy tries to teach the people to value their lives in such an extreme way.
I would die if I had to do any of those things in real life.
I don't know what I would do in those scenerios.
Good thing its just a movie, right?
Yeah really. That movie is nightmare fuel.
I might have had a nightmare or two about scenes from that movie.
