What was your favorite 'Fast & Furious' movie?
That's a tough question to answer.  I loved Five, but Seven was so emotional.
Yea, that last scene was such a touching goodbye to Paul Walker and his character.
I'd say it's a tie between those two.  How about you?
I actually really loved the first two.
You mean when it used to be about street racing?
Exactly.  That was always the main appeal for me.
They still have racing.
They do, but the racing is portrayed almost like an afterthought.
You have a point.  After Tokyo Drift, that street racing element started to get placed in the background.
