Have you seen Cabin in the Woods?
Yes I have. It happens to be one of my favorite horror/comedy movies.
Did you know that Joss Whedon was one of the writers of the movie?
I didn't know that. I love his work on Buffy the Vampire Slayer.
Me too. I think he also produced the movie too.
Very cool. Who was your favorite character in the movie?
I loved Marty. He was always saying some funny stuff.
I liked him too. I loved Bradly Whitford's character.
Ya I think his character was named Steve.
You're right it was Steve. So sad he had to die in the end.
