Jar Jar Binks - yes or no?
Ummm, is that even a question? No way
Why not?
He was a horrible character, there's no doubt about it
Yeah, I don't know what they were thinking with him
Someone thought it was a good idea at some point
Whatever happened to him in the series?
I think he made a few more appearances in the later movies, but that was it
Hard core fans hated him
Yes, they did...for sure.
