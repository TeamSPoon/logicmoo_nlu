Are you listening to the Beatles again?
When am I not listening to the Beatles?
Good point. I like their music, but never really understood the hype.
They had class and talent.
Sure, don't get me wrong I like them, Yellow Sub and Sergent Pepper's are both great.
Those are the most popular, but they have a lot of more technical songs that are better.
Really? Do you think they achieved such stardom because of all the controversy and the untimely dying.
Well, the music industry loves a good controversy and artists are always more popular after they die.
So, John Lennon wouldn't be as much of a legend if he were alive.
Maybe, but Paul McCartney is still a legend and he is alive. So they are just that good!
