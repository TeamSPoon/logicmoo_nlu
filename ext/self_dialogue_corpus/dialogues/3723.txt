I tend to think of Die Hard as a Christmas movie, but I think it's also a great thriller.
Well, it certainly is an exciting movie.
Especially the first one. Like, the premise is so interesting.
Because of John McClaine?
Well, no, because of the villain, Hans Gruber.
What about him?
He's a very megalomaniacal character. And his scheme is really brilliant.
He also has a great downfall.
That's important for any good villain.
I should try watching Die Hard again sometime soon.
