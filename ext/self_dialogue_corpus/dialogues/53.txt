Did you see the Fantastic Four reboot?
No. I hated the originals.
They were great, but you should give the reboot a shot.
I might. I think casting might have been part of the problem.
It's funny how the same actors play different superheros.
How do you mean?
The Human Torch becomes Captain America.
I totally forgot about that!
Green Lantern becomes Deadpool.
Huh, you're right!
