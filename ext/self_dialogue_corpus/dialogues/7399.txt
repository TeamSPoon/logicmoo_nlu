So, I was building a snowman this afternoon and it reminded me of that song from Frozen.
Do you want to build a snowman?
No, the one Ana sings to Elsa when their parents die.
Do you want to build a snowman?
No I did that early today. Damn I wish I could remember the song?
Do you want to build a snowman!
No I don't, let it go already.
No, you let it go.
Stop being such an Elsa and go outside.
Fine. The cold never bothered me anyway.
