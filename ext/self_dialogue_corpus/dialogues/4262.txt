What is your favorite Thriller movie?
I really like The Eye, have you seen it?
No, who was in it?
It starred Jessica Alba.
Hmm, I still dont think I've heard of it. Have you seen The Hills Have Eyes?
I loved that movie!
Me too. I think it could've been loosely based on real events.
What do you mean?
Well think about all the nuclear testing that went on, is it really that hard to imagine a scenario playing out like that?
I guess you could be right.
