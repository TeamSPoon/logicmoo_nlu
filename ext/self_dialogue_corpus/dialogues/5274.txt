On the topic of villains, what about Cruella DeVille?
Best evil name ever!
Right? And she was totally evil.
Obviously - who could make a coat out of puppies?
Someone VERY concerned with fashion.
Heh, and the Dalmatians were just collateral damage?
That's a good way to look at it.
Maybe I have a career in super villainy.
Well, you just need to find some puppies to make your costume!
And maybe get a few henchmen too.
