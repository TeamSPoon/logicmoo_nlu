Did you see the latest news on Alternative Press?
No I haven't. Is it good news?
Well, not exactly. Do you like Of Mice and Men?
Like them, no. I absolutely LOVE them.
Me too. Sorry to have to be the one to tell you this, but Austin Carlisle has officially left the band.
Oh no! How will this affect the music? Without his voice Of Mice and Men just wont be the same.
He has to focus on his health. The doctors warned him that if he continued at the rate he was going with touring and recording that he could end up paralyzed.
That would be awful. It sounds like it was a decision that had to be made.
Totally. And we know Austin can't completely walk away from the post-hardcore rock music scene.
You're right, he's made for it. I'm excited to hear what he does next, and for what Of Mice and Men do next.
