Do you like the Lumineers?
The Lumineers...what do they sing?
Cleopatra, Ophelia..oh and Ho Hey
Oh yeah! I remember them! They're okay.
I feel the same. I mean, I really like the sound. But honestly..I'm hesitant to like them because they're too popular.
Too popular? Come on. Seriously?
Yeah. I know it's stupid.
You obviously like their sound, though, right?
Yeah. Ophelia was my favorite for a long time.
Then why not just admit you like them.
Okay. I like them.
Have you heard their latest album?
Cleopatra? Most of it.
Is it worth me checking out?
Definitely. Its a different sound from the last album and has some really catchy songs.
Okay, I'll check it out.
Do you think you might want to go to a Lumineers concert with me sometime?
Sure, that sounds fun.
Awesome! Maybe next summer?
Sounds like a plan!
