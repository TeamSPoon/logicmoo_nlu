Have you ever listened to Incubus.
A little bit. Are they pretty good?
They're great! I actually really like their older stuff.
I've only heard their radio songs.
Yeah Drive is a pretty good song.
I really like Pardon Me too!
That one is reallly good as well!
Which album do you like best?
Personally their first one.
No kidding. Is it really good?
It's very heavy. Now they sound more pop.
Wow I bet I would like it.
You should check them out!
I definitely will now.
I think they still put out music too.
Yeah I think I've seen them putting out music.
I don't think I'd hear it on the radio.
Yeah probably not.
Well go check them out when you have the chance!
I definitely will do!
