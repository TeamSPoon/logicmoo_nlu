Toy Story 1, 2, or 3?
Toy Story 1 is the best, by far.
No, I think 3 takes the cake.
3 is great. But Nothing can beat the original.
But we can agree that number 2 isn't great?
Number 2 is good, but yeah, doesn't beat 1 or 3.
Favorite Characters?
Buzz and Woody, of course.
I literally just found out that the voices of those two are Tom Hanks and Tim Allen.
I knew Tom Hanks was in it, but I didn't know about Tim Allen.
I love them both.
You think there will be a 4?
I'm not sure. I don't think there has ever been a Pixar movie with 4 different ones.
Most of the super successful ones get a sequel, but even 3 is rare.
Yeah, I doubt there will be a fourth.
But if there is, I'll watch it opening day.
Oh, so will I.
I just looked it up. There WILL be one.
What, whats the plot?
Its not a continuation of 3, its a whole new one!
