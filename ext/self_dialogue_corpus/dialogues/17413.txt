Ever heard of Reggie and the Full Effect?
Does not sound familiar to me.
Its one guy who plays a keyboard.
So is it a parody band?
No he used to be the drummer for the get up kids.
Oh is his name James
Yes! You know who he is?
Yeah I have heard of them before
Their first album Under the Tray was funny
Lyrically?
No the CD was under the tray in the case so people had a hard time finding it.
I think I may have listened to it.
It wasnt that bad of an album to begin with.
I liked their latest release.
Yeah his lyrics are very personal
i think he writes from the heart.
Yeah one album was dedicated to his divorce
Sounds very depressing though
It was but you can feel what he was going through
I like that you could make a connection
