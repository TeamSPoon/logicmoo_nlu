What was the best thriller of 1975?
Jaws
That is a great thriller
It might be the best ever made
The shark is really scary
I like how they hide him and don't show much of him
That is the key to the suspense in that film
The ending is even more suspenseful
Yeah, when the ship was sinking, I was on the edge of my seat.
Me too!
