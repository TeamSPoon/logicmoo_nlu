Our friend told us to watch the thriller secret Window.
Good movie. Johnny Depp is in it.
Is he a cop?
No he's a writer.
Is he a goofy character like some of his other movies?
No, not really. He does have some metal issues though.
Makes sense if it's a thriller.
Yeah, you should watch it. I really liked it.
What year is that from so I know where to look online.
I think from the early 2000's.
