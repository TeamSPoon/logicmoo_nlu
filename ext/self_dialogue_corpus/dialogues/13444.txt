I watched A New Hope the other day.
Me too, its strange to watch that after seeing Rogue One, give a different perspective.
I noticed how the budget is different, for example you can see the smoke and dust in the lightsaber fight.
They also kept in a few mistakes that are pretty funny.
Yes, my favorite is when the stormtroopers enter where the droids are hiding,and one of them hits his head on the ceiling.
I heard that that was not planned but they left it in anyway.
It wasn't they interview the actor who recently did that and he told what happened.
THat had to be interesting what did he say?
He was feeling sick, they had to finish the take, he tried ot rush through wasnt concentration and as a result hit his head.
Wow, amazing how many things you can learn abotu the star wars franchise.
