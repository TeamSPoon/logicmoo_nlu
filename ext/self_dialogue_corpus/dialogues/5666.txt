Who's your favorite DIsney princess?
I really like Jasmine!
Why is she your favorite?
Mainly two reasons. First, she looks most like me--long dark hair, you know?
That makes sense. What's the other reason?
She's independent with some spunk--like how she's not going to let anyone tell her who to marry!
So true! I think Pocahontas is like that too.
How so?
She listens to her heart and makes decisions she believes are right, instead of just listening to other people.
So true, they are similar in that way.
