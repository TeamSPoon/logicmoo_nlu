aside from Tom Brady, who do you think the best quarterbacks were in the 2016 season
I think you definitely need to include Aaron Rodgers on the list
I would agree with that. he had like 40 touchdowns in 2016
Matt Ryan obviously deserves to be on the list, even though he lost the big game
yes, he put some monster numbers. he averaged something like 309 yard per game
that is insane. most quarterbacks would kill for those numbers
who else do you think should make the best of 2016 list
this might be controversial, but Dallas Cowboys Dak Prescott had an excellent rookie year
lets see if he can repeat that performance now that there is some game tape of him
he had about 23 touchdowns and only 4 interceptions. he does a really good job of protecting the football, and found ways to help the cowboys win games
plus he is a rushing threat. he racked up close to 230 yards per game
another quarterback to watch based on his 2016 performance is Derek Carr
he made the Raiders look really good last year. Their offense was pretty high power all things considered
he completion rate was pretty solid at 64%, and his 28 TDs were pretty impressive
If the Raiders get a few more offensive weapons next year they could be really dangerous
back to QBs... another one that makes the 2016 list is Drew Brees
Oh for sure. he really spread around the football among his receiving core. it feels like he was always finding different targets in the endzone
ha. so true. he would throw 5 touchdowns in a game, to 5 different receivers
an honorable mention should probably go to Ben Roethlisberger as well. he put up 29 TDs and about 272 yards per game
Go Big Ben!!!
