So...Batman movies, what do you think?
Do you mean the Michael Keaton "I'm Batman" movies?
Well, yeah those and then the all the other ones as well.
I liked Michael Keaton. I wish he would've done more.
It kind of went off the cliff once he left.
Yeah, there were so many iterations.
Yeah, Val Kilmer and George Clooney.
Oh, George Clooney! Wasn't that the infamous nipple batsuit.
Oh man I forgot about that one. Yikes!
Yeah, those were really bad.
And then along came Christopher Nolan and Christian Bale
Yeah, that was a good roboot
Especially the Joker one with Heath Ledger.
Yeah he was good, but I also like Jack Nicholson as the joker.
Really? Jack Nicholson?
Yeah, for some reason I like the cartoonish factor of his portrayal.
Ummm...I guess if you say so. I still think Ledger was better.
But there was no Prince music at the museum!
Oh my...Prince RIP.
Yeah, Prince RIP.
