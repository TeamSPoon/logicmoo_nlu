Hey Marie!
How you doing Bob?!
I'm good.. did you get a chance to watch the superbowl over the weekend?
Yes I did even thought I am not a fan of football..
Really? but what makes you watch the Superbowl then?
I love just watching the half-time show and the commercials
What did you like about the half-time show this year?
I am a really big fan of Lady Gaga -- she is such a talented artist
I'm not really a fan of hers :(
Did you at least enjoy the commercials?
Well the ones I saw? I mean thats my time for bathroom break haha
yeah of the ones you saw which did you like?
I liked the one showing the history of the Beer company.. it made me really think about the fact we are all immigrants
oh yeah that was really meaningful given the timing
Yep
My husband said that the game was good -- according to his standards
Oh yeah the Patriots MUSHED the falcons!!!
Wow MUSHED EH?!
Yeah.. well lets see who they have next year for the halftime show and we can talk about it then
Sure! Good deal!!
