What is you favorite  McGonagall moment in the last two movies?
When her and Snape duke it out in Deatlhy Hollows part two.
Just about everything she does in that one is awesome.
When she and Snape have the battle in the main hall, it is equal parts funny and sad.
When she sayd " I always wanted to use that spell" after she hits him with a good one, I love that scene.
It showed that she was a powerful witch, but still cool and sweet about it.
They hinted the whole series she was. But she cared more about kids than being known for her power.
That scene just cemented it. That she did not really like Snape.
I do not think anyone but Lily and Dumbledore ever actually liked Snape before he died.
And Lily stopped liking him pretty soon after she found out he was not so nice.
