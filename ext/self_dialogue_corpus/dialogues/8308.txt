I've been listening to Taylor Swift lately and I actually like it.
I like some of hers but my favorite right now is Arianna Grande.
Yeah, after the bombing she got a lot of attention.  I hadn't really heard of her music until then.
So what did you think of it?
I liked it.  It's just not as intense as I prefer.
I guess it is more for a younger crowd.  Do you like Justin Timberlake?
oh yes!  I forgot about him!
He is really good!  What about that song Can't Stop the Feeling?
I love that!  I like to play it in the mornings when I need to get going but am feeling really down and sluggish.
It's the perfect song to get you up and feeling good for the day!
