Do you like any of Stanley Kubrick's movies?
Like The Shining and A Clockwork Orange?
Yes! He's my favorite director and I think his cinematography was superb.
I agree. I didn't follow him like that but those movies are amazing.
My favorite by him though has to be 2001: A Space Odyssey
The special effects in that movie were amazing even by today's standards.
That's the main draw of that movie, that and the symbolic concepts.
Some say it was the philosophers' stone, that huge black monolith.
Right, it has to do with human transformation and transcendence.
Awesome themes. I love movies with substance.
Well have you ever watched AI: Artificial Intelligence? With Haley Joel Osment?
I've never seen it. Is it any good?
It definitely is. Steven Spielberg is another great director.
I loved ET. He directed that didn't he?
Yes! That was the first movie I remember seeing at the theater.
Wow that's wonderful. Do you like any other Spielberg movies.
Oh of course. Close Encounters of the Third Kind, The Color Purple...he just really can't go wrong.
I love his use of lighting. That's his hallmark.
Right. The Spielbergian light. Some have tried to duplicate it but can't come close.
I agree. He's one of the greatest along with Scorcese, Tarantino, Nolan, and Boyle.
