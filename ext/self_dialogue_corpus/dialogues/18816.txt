What was the last concert you've been to?
It's been a few years, but it was Boston Calling.
Who were the headliners?
The Pixies were.  Them and Jack Black.
Jack Black the comedian?
Yep, he has a band too.  Tenacious D.
How were they?
Surprisingly they were awesome.  I mean they were funny but those guys flat out shred.
You can't be serious?  Jack Black?
Yeah, the guy rocks.
I guess that makes sense.  I did see school of rock.
And the Pixies were awesome too.  I forgot, Vance Joy was there.
Wow, sounds like a great concert.
Boston calling always is.  I mean it's expensive but you get an amazing concert.
Yeah, I went to Kenny Chesney at Gillette a while back.  It was called country fest.
I went to that too, it's kind of similar there's just so much quality music all day long.
Same thing as you said.  Expensive tickets but when you look at what you get it's quite the deal.
I know, it's not that much more than a regular ticket but you get five times as much.
Can't argue with that.
Plus the beer helps too.
