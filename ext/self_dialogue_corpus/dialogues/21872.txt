What are your favorite genre of movie?
I like political themed movies and thrillers?
I tend to like anything with Meryl Streep.
Oh okay. So did you like Manchurian Candidate? That's a political thriller
Not my favorite movie but it was pretty good. Meryl played the bad guy.
Well yeah... She reminded me of Hillary Clinton. haha
Yeah I can see that. Probably why I didnt like it that much.
I liked it but my favorite political thriller that's Female Driven is "The Contender"
What's that about?
It stars Joan Allen as a senator who gets nominated for Vice President. They dig up sex scandals about her.
sounds boring...
It's really not Joan Allen got nominated for best actress. She lost to Julia Roberts for Erin Brockovich. i think she got cheated
Really... then why havent I heard of this movie?
It was a small movie but with incredible talent. It's director did "All the Presidents Men" also had Jeff Bridges, Gary Oldman and Christian Slater.
Oh wow that's a good cast.
Jeff bridges played president and got nominated for best supporting actor. Gave one of the best speeches i've ever heard in a movie.
You seem to really like this movie. I may have to check it out.
You certainly should. I have a copy. Wanna borrow it or have a movie night ?
Sure if you'll watch Devil wears Prada afterwards.
Sounds like a plan.
