I know you're a big comedy fan. Which comedy have you watched the most times?
Dumb and Dumber. It's so hilarious and ridiculous.
It's been awhile since I saw that one. What's your favorite part?
Maybe when Harry uses the broken toilet. Immature humor I know, but I watched that scene over and over.
That's a good part! There's so many funny moments though, it's hard to choose.
I also like when Lloyd is walking around wearing that ridiculous hat. It cracked me up!
I think for me it's National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation. I could never watch it enough times.
I love that one too, the cat getting electrocuted, Clark's tirade at the end, it's a classic. I also like the original Vacation.
Clark Griswold getting all misty-eyed when he's stranded in the attic watching home movies is my favorite part.
I loved that too, Clark's such a great character. What other comedies are among your favorites?
Animal House with John Belushi, Caddyshack with Bill Murray and Chevy Chase, and Blazing Saddles with Mel Brooks and Harvey Korman.
I'm not a big fan of Caddyshack, it has its moments but overall it's disappointing to me.
Really? You don't like Rodney Dangerfield and his one liners or Ted Knight's stuffiness?
I do like those, but overall the movie is not that funny to me. Blazing Saddles, that's a classic though.
We can look past Caddyshack. Yes Blazing Saddles was hilarious but could never be made today.
That's true and I understand why but it's also disappointing in a way because it was some really good comedy.
What recent comedies are some of your favorites? Bridesmaids was good and I liked The Hangover movies.
Wow I thought you said recent. The Hangover was made in 2009 and Bridesmaids was made in 2011.
Are there any recent good ones you would suggest? Also, do you think there are not as many good ones these days?
This is the End from 2013 and 21 Jump Street from 2012, but I guess those aren't too recent either. I think they don't make as many good movies as they used to.
