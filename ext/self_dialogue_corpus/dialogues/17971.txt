What's your favorite Michael Jackson song?
I don't think I have just one. Can I give you a few?
Nope, just one.
You're strict.
Mine's 'Thriller'. See, it's not hard.
That's definitely one of my favorites.
Okay, let's narrow it down.
I also have to consider 'Billie Jean,' 'Beat It,' and 'Bad'.
It seems you're into old school Michael.
Definitely. I'd say his early solo stuff was his best work.
I agree. He kept working, but could never really capture the level he had in the 80s.
Oh, I also really like 'Smooth Criminal' even though I still don't really know what it's about.
Right? Who is Annie?
And why keep asking if she's okay when she's clearly not?
Ha! That song just had a really good beat.
You know what's funny is I used to sing along to 'Billie Jean' as a kid and had no idea what it was about.
Me too! It wasn't until I got older that I was like, ohhhh...
He probably had to deal with that kind of thing.
Yeah, anytime someone gets famous the crazies will come out.
At least we got an awesome song out of it.
