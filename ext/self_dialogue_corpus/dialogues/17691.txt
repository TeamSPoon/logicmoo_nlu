Do you think bands like Sugar Ray and Matchbox Twenty will ever make a come back?
I don't know, a lot of bands have.
Which ones?
The Backstreet boys are on tour again.
I loved their song, Backs Streets Back.
I think everyone alive then liked that one.
What about Matchbox 20?
They did a bit more serious ones.
What did you like best?
I loved Unwell.
That song really changed their feel for me.
Ron Thomas went on to make some solo stuff.
I heard that, what did he do?
HE did a remake of Time After Time, it was really pretty.
Did he do anything else I might know?
His, Something To Be, album did really well in 2005.
What was on it?
The song, Diamonds hit the floor, and Lonely No More.
I did not even know he sang that one.
Yes, he even did a few songs for a cartoon movie, Meat the Robinsons.
