What are your thoughts on the Rolling Stones?
Love them.  I don't like them live but their studio albums are great.
What about Mick Jagger?
I don't think the guy has gained a pound in 50 years but he's still high energy.
Tell me about AC/DC.
Unbelievable.  They didn't miss a best when Bon Scott died.
What about Brian Johnson who got the lead singer role after Scott died.
The proof is in the pudding.  They put out Back in Black and it was huge.  I love them.
A lot of these old bands are still cranking out music when the performers are well into their 60's and 70's.  Which is your favorite?
Again, I still love the music AC/DC.
Let's go to the other end of the spectrum.  Who do you think has stuck around too long?
The Boss, Bruce Springsteen.  He was great in the 1970's and 1980's. But now I think he's too political.  He should hang it up.
Speaking of Springsteen, the Big Man, Clarence Clemons recently died.
Yes, a tragedy.  He was set to play football in college but got injured.  He joined the E Street Band and he and the Boss were best friends after that.
What do you think about more recent music?
I like some of the newer groups.  Smashmouth, Plain White Tee's and Lady Gaga.
She took her name from Queen's Radio Gaga.
I call that up on YouTube from time to time when their at Wembly Stadium.  It's a powerful video.
Do you like country music?
Some of it.  I really enjoy Kenny Chesney's song Summertime.
