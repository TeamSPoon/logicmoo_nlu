We're thinking of having a Men in Black party. Want to come?
Men in Black? What's that?
You don't remember? It was a big movie franchise in the nineties.
I'm drawing a blank here.
Will Smith was in it? He works for an agency that fights aliens.
Oh. Okay. I just didn't know the title.
So are you in?
Yeah, that sounds like fun. Do I need to bring anything special.
Well, I was thinking of having everyone wear suits.
That could be fun!
Yeah. Anyway, we'll double feature the first two of them.
How many are there?
Three, and an animated TV show.
Is there any way we could start early and watch all of them?
Maybe. Would you be willing to bring dinner?
Let's just get take out!
Hmm. Okay. I could go for that.
Then next week we can do a movie night at my place.
What will we watch?
I was thinking Homeward Bound!
