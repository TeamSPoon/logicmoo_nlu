What do you think should happen to the NBA's bottom-feeders?
What do you mean?
Teams like the Magic, Knicks, Pistons, 76ers, Suns, Lakers, Timberwolves.
Yeah, what about them?
They're awful pretty much every year.
So? Doesn't the draft help that?
It helps a bit, but clearly some teams never have playoff-caliber years.
So, I have no idea. What should happen?
I think if a team is bad every year, they should get far more high picks in the draft.
Yeah, why should the team who won the championship even have a chance at the no. 1 pick?
That's awful. If you win the title, and your players are locked up in contracts, you shouldn't get any first-or second round picks.
I agree--maybe make the first round exclusive to teams who were below .400 for two or more years.
What about teams who intentionally lose?
That's a rarity. If in a competitive sport, it's found people intentionally lose, they just flat out shouldn't be paid.
Performance-based pay in the NBA?
Sounds crazy, but why should they get guaranteed contracts playing a game if they don't put forth the effort? If no fans show up they still get paid.
Yeah, but they are drama queens.
Performance-based pay would never work.
Imagine that in real-life. $9/hr flipping burgers but if your productivity goes down you're fired.
Meanwhile in the NBA, if you miss 2/3 of your shots, you still are rich. It's crazy.
