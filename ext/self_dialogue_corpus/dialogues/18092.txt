Like we saw in Genesis and Chronicles, there is a lot of examples of music in Biblical times.
Are all of them as uplifting as the ones we have already reviewed?
If your look at Exodus chapter 32 and verse 18, you will find an answer of sorts.
"But Moses replied: 'No, it's not a cry of victory or defeat, but singing'".
I notice you have an American Standard version in your bookcase. Can I borrow it just one moment, please?
No problem, would you like to read the scripture from there?
Yup, I found it. "And he said, It is not the voice of them that shout for mastery, neither is it the voice of them that cry for being overcome; but the noise of them that sing do I hear"
Wow, I perceive a more colorful verse in this one.
It's interesting that in here, the singing of the israelites was referred to as "noise"
I remember when my daughter was a baby, she would start singing out loud and I said, "come on ,stop that noise!'
So it means this time God was not pleased at all when his chosen people started singing.
Do you think they did not have any singing talent at all?
It is actually related with the subject of their singing.
Why do you say that?
Do you remember the story of the Golden Calf?
I remember having seen it in the "Ten Commandments " movie.
Remember why Moses broke the tables of stone when he heard them singing?
If I'm right, he was displeased they were singing to a golden idol that was not approved by God.
So it is very interesting that music has a lot of power and influence in the things we do.
Yeah, a power that should be mastered carefully
