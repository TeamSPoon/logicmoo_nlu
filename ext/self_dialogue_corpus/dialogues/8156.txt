do you like Pop music in general?
yea, I'm obsessed with them, they usually have very good vibe and projects positive images
I agree. So what singers do you listen to most often
I like katy perry, taylor swift, avril lavigne, and recently Paramore has come to my attention as well
Paramore and katy perry's music is more energetic, isn't it
yeah, that's true, unlike the others, I only listen to their music when the day's bright, or my mood is high
I agree on that. It just so nice to have Taylor Swift and Avril Lavigne here with us, they always have great music for everyday
yeah, I loved Innocence and 1989 album from taylor swift
who do you like better, taylor swift or avril lavigne?
I honesly can't choose, I love them both
