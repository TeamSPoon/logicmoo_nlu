Hey, so you think the Falcons will be able to make it back to the super bowl?
No, in fact, I don't think they'll win the NFC south this year.
Who do you think will win?
Honestly I could see any team winning it this year, it will be the toughest division.
That's true, and now the Saints have Adrian Peterson.
Exactly, they should be better, and don't forget about Carolina.
Yeah, Cam Newton won't have another down year.  When he's good they should contend for a super bowl.
What's your take on Tampa Bay?
They're a young team, but should be better this year than last.
Given all that, I just don't think the falcons have it in them.
Plus, they lost Kyle Shanahan to San Francisco, do you think that will hurt them?
I do.  Matt Ryan was mediocre at best before he came along, and then with him he won the MVP.
So if it's not the falcons repeating, who wins it all this year?
I think it will be the Patriots vs Green Bay.
You still think Brady can play at a high level?
I do, and I think he wouldn't continue playing if he couldn't.
That's true, he wants to win and I don't think he would play either if he couldn't continue winning.
And green bay will always be good with Aaron Rodgers.  They've lost a lot, but still have the pieces in place.
Should be another great season.
Yeah, I'm looking forward to the fall already.
