Ok, give me your three greatest rock songs of all time.
I'd have to say Metallica's "One" would be at the top of my list.
Me too, it's long and powerful and you feel like there's a machine gun firing next to you when you listen to it.
My number two would be Gimme Shelter by the Stones.
That's a great song dude. The background vocals are just incredible.
My number three would be Free Bird by Lynyrd Skynyrd.
It's a little long but the way it starts off so slow and then just takes off is awesome.
Did you know those guys named their band after their high school gym teacher?
What? That's not how he spelled his name is it?
No, but they liked the way it sounded and decided to change the spelling and adopt the name.
