what do you think about Kanye West?
well, he's an excellent hip hop singer surrounded with quite some complications
yea, I heard his wife was put at gun point at a hotel, so Kanye has to cancel his concert while perfoming
wow, that sounds pretty dramatic, in a bad way
yea, but anyway, from audience's perspective, I just like some of his music
such as?
he published a lot of albums, have you heard of Champions?
yea, he wasn't singing alone right?
no, it was a feat, there were actually 2 people in the songs
sounds like a great song
