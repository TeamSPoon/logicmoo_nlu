What is your favorite thriller movie?
John Wick
That move is awesome!
Yea, it restarted Keanu's career
I feel the same way.  He never had much since The Matrix
For the most part, yea.  Constantine was OK.
Yea, Constantine did decently well, but not as much as John Wick
Agreed.  He really needed that movie
Yea, and John Wick 2 is out
I so want to see it!
