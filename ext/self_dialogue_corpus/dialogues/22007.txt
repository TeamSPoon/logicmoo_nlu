I have the kids this weekend and I wanted to take them to see a movie.  I need some ideas
Have they ever been to a 3-D movie?
No I am pretty sure they haven't. That's a good idea!
Let me see what is playing that they may like. Hold on just a minute.
Okay. I know that The Lego Batman Movie is out.
Yes that would be a good one or Emoji Movie.
They are border line age wise starting to like a little older movies.
Well be careful you don't want to insult them by the movie you suggest.
This sounds pretty tricky. Maybe you should come with us.
What and help you navigate through the evening?
Yes that would be nice.
Well let's look for some alternatives to offer.
I trust your judgement. You are much better at picking movies than I am.
Okay so I found that Pirates of the Caribbean and Star Wars are playing
Pirates of the Caribbean would be one they would like for sure.
Good then You can give them an option when we pick them up.
Let's get them early enough to go to dinner and then ask them to pick which they would like to do.
It sounds good to me. Just let me know me know what time to be ready.
I will do that. Hey where should we go to eat?
Oh brother!!! Not that too!!
