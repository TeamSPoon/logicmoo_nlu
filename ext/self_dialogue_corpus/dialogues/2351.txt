Would you consider of a big NFL fan?
Absolutely. What about you?
Definitely. I love the NFL. Being from Ohio, are you a Browns fan?
Well, yes and no. I tend to have a love/hat relationship with Cleveland.
That is interesting. Why do you say that?
They are considered the "Home team", but it's difficult at times to get behind them.
They were considered the "worst team in the NFL" last season.
Yes, that is correct and I do recall hearing that.
Are most of your friends and family Browns fans?
Oh yes, absolutely. And that is why I try to stay behind them.
Because if they do well, your friends and family will be happy?
Yes, pretty much. If the Browns do better, than it's a happy day for those close to me.
That is a decent enough reason to get behind a somewhat negative-received team.
I think so, as well. Not only that, but I am also a fan of the underdog.
It seems that when it comes to the Browns, they either do really well or really poorly most of the time.
Yes, I can see that point.
They have had some real negative defeats but also some decent wins over the years. Who would you consider their best rival?
Most would say the Ravens, but I actually think the Steelers.
Interesting point. Why do you say?
I think because Browns/Steelers games always are fun to watch and usually competitive.
