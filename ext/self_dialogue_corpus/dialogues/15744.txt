Have you heard Noel Gallagher's latest cd?
No, I didn't know he released a new one.
You need to check it out. Some good tunes there.
Reminiscent of Oasis?
Somewhat, you do hear a bit of Oasis.
I will definitely check it out. I loved Oasis!
Who have you been listening to?
I really like Gin Wigmore. She's fantastic - especially the songs Black Sheep and Man Like That.
I've never heard of her.
You've heard the song Man Like That, I'll bet.
I don't think so. I think you said you like Derek Trucks, didn't you?
Yes, I love his music.
Have you listened to Tedeschi Trucks Band albums?
Yes, I've heard quite a bit of it. I love their sound.
Me, too! I love blues rock.
You should check out Davey Knowles and Back Door Slam. There's some music as just Back Door Slam. They are very good. I really like their music.
I have never heard of them either. I'll check out them and Gin Wigmore. I need some new stuff to play.
You'll like them both. They're original and talented.
Have you heard Katy Perry's latest?
Ha ha ! No, I think I'll pass on that one.
