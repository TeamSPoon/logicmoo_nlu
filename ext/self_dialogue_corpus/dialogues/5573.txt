Did you take the kids to see the new Beauty and the Beast?
Yeah it was really good.
The special effects were out of this world.
Tell me about it.  The candle was awesome.
And just as funny as the cartoon.
I couldn't believe how close that was to the cartoon version.
Yea it couldn't have been closer.
Although the Gastone song was way funnier in the cartoon.
You can't have everything.
But seriously it was good.
