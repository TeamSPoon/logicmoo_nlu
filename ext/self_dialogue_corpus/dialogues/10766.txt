Have you seen Fast & Furious 6?
Absolutely I loved it.
Do you recall the part where they're racing down the highway trying to save Letty?
I don't recall that no can you rejog my memory.
I can try, well there was a man I don't remember his name in a tank.
I do remember the tank that was crazy.
Yeah and they were trying to save letty.
I don't remember that part.
Well Dom was on one side of the highway and they were on the other and Letty got thrown from the vehicle when Dom flew through the air and caught her smashing into a car.
Oh yes now I remember.
