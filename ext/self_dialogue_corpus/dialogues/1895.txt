You know, a lot of people think football is young man's game.
That's because they end up getting hurt and can't play that long.
There was an article I read about ten NFL players who are over 35 and doing great.
You mean like Tom Brady?
Yep, of course Brady. He's 39 and won his fifth Super Bowl last year.
I know a lot of people were talking about the Cardinal's Carson Palmer last year, because he had a rough season.
Yeah, but the year before he was an MVP candidate.
And of there's Drew Brees. He's like 38 or 39, and still very much in the game.
He's really popular with the fans, and he has this great cancer foundation.
I think a lot depends on their postition. Quarterbacks and kickers could probably play longer.
This is true, linemen are going to get injured a lot faster.
There was some speculation about Brady's health.
Oh yeah, I read that. Where his wife said he had concussions, but the coaches or whatever backtracked that.
I could see Brady trying to hold out a couple more years though, hoping for another Super Bowl ring or two.
I saw in one of the gossip rags how those rings got him in trouble.
How's that?
H was flying on Ben Affleck's plane and let Ben's nanny try on his Super Bowl rings.
Brady's wife Gisele seems like a tiger, I doubt she liked that.
No, I think he was in the doghouse explaining that.
Brady seems to attract controversy like a magnet.
