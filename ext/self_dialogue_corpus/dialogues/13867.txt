Have you heard Lady Gaga's song "The Cure", I think it's newish.
Yes, I really like it.
It's very simple, but Gaga makes it interesting.
I agree, she can turn anything into gold.
I don't think it's getting much radio play, though.
Yeah, I'm very confused on radio plays and singles nowadays.
I agree, I think the artists pays for plays to be honest.
It's supposed to be looked down upon, but you know it's going on.
That's why you only hear certain songs over and over again.
And that's why I only listen to Spotify!
