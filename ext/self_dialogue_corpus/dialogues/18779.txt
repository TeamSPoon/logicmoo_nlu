Do you like Fleetwood Mac?
I love them. Stevie Nicks is the best.
She sure is. What's your favorite song by them?
That would probably be The Chain.
Rihanna is my favorite. I turned my bestie on to Fleetwood Mac.
They're just so laid back to listen to and chill out.
Right that's part of their appeal, that and Stevie's voice.
It's so haunting and ethereal. I love Silver Spring, that's another favorite.
That and Sara are two of the most beautiful songs ever written.
She puts so much passion into her writing and singing.
She went through a lot and it came through in her music.
I would have loved to live in the classic rock era.
Right, I would have been going to Pink Floyd concerts.
Did you know Dark Side of the Moon corresponds with the Wizard of Oz
Oh I heard that! If you play them simultaneously it looks like the album is the soundtrack for the movie.
That is so awesome. They even have movie showings at theaters where they play them together.
I heard that too. What other groups do you like from that era?
Well I loved the clash. I love punk rock in general
The White Stripes sort of bring that sound back.
Right there's that mixed with what they call garage rock in their sounds.
