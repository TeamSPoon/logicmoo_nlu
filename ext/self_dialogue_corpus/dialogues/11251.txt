What is that brand you are wearing.
It's a designer out of the UK called UK designs.
It's very well fitted, is it supposed to be that tight?
Yes and no, It may have shrunk in the wash cycle
Well that is a shame.
Thanks, am I able to pull off a tight look?
Not at all but your confidence is the think that rocks through
Wow I never thought of my self esteem effecting my fashion
Well it really can, trust me, I was once very nervousness and lacked confidence in everything.
Was it not until I found fashion did my life get better. So fashion really made you confident?
Yes indeed. I found that being able to express myself anyway I wanted I was able to grow as a person.
So what styles attract you the most?
Well, let's see, I really like to dress in modern styles that have lots of colour. What about you?
Well I would have to say formal wear is my favorite. I just like to look posh.
Is that because you aren't posh?
Pretty much. I only really wear what people would like to see me in. In that way I am a push-over
That is true, but where did you get your shoes?
Well I got them at pay-less actually, they where a steal.
And they are so cute on you. I wish I had shoes like that.
I know I like that they are high tops and have an extreme amount of colours.
