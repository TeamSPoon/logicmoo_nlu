Hey,I'm going to see Paul McCartney in September.
Really,where?
In Syracuse. Only about a three hour drive.
That's cool,I've never seen him.
This will be the fifth time I've seen him.
The show has to be great!
It's incredible. Usually about three hours and almost 40 songs.
Wow,he has enough of them.
He does have a lot. Sings a lot of Beatles,wings,and solo.
I've got to see him before he retires.
