What do you think was the best Spielberg movie?
Wow, thats a hard question. He has had so many.
I think mine was Jurrasic Park.
I forgot he did that.
That was an excellent job filming that.
Yes, he is good. I think E.T was over rated.
It was good, but I agree.
Close Encounters was pretty good. The alien theme again.
Yes. I don't remember that whole movie too much.
I think Saving Private Ryan was my favorite.
You're right. That was excellent.
Especially the cast too.
Tom Hanks as a lead actor. Can't go wrong with that.
Minority Report wasn't bad.
That was pretty good too.
I like tom Cruise in movies.
Yes, but they shouldve stopped making them.
The first was the best.
Action packed.
It definitely was.
