Did you ever see Disney's version of Pinocchio?
The old cartoon?
Yeah, that's it.
Yeah, my mom had rented it for us on VHS when I was a kid.
And you still remember it?
I remember parts of it.
What do you remember from it?
I think what stuck with me were the things that became controversial?
Oh, like don't the kids smoke and drink beer?
Yeah, something like that.  Even as a kid, it seemed wrong to watch.
