Have you ever seen the movie American Beauty?
I haven't. Is it any good?
It's a great movie! It's got Kevin Spacey in it.
Ugh I love Kevin Spacey so much.
He's such an awesome actor.
I bet the movie is really good.
It is! He plays a dad who hates his life.
That sounds really depressing.
Well it starts that way but then he redeems himself.
How does he do that?
He quits his job and starts working out a lot.
This movie doesn't sound too good.
I'm making it sound much worse than it is.
Does it have good reviews?
Yes! It won an oscar for best picture back in the day!
Oh wow. I guess it must be good then.
I promise it's way better than I'm making it seem.
Do you have a copy of it?
I do! Do you want to borrow it?
Yes please!
