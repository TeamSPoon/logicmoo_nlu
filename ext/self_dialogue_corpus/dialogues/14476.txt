Have you been watching any of the playoffs?
Yeah, but I'm not sure why.
What do you mean?
Well, Cleveland just beat the Celtics by 55 and the Spurs are hurt.
Yeah, that was a blowout.  Up 41 at the half.  Jeez.
There is more parity in football.
Maybe, but think about the finals.
I think I was already thinking about the finals before these last matchups even started.
So you think they should just end the season and then let the Cavs and Warriors play to see who's boss?
Sort of.  I mean I don't expect buzzer beaters every game but all the games seem to be one sided, no matter who wins.
Yeah, you're right, things have been a little boring so far.
But the Warriors-Cavs final should change all that.
I hope so, I like watching playoff basketball.  Who do you think is going to win?
Well, LeBron seems like a player of destiny.
But the Warriors seem more well rounded.
I would never count out LeBron, or bet against him for that matter.
You are probably right.  I just hope we see a good series.
You don't like 41 point leads at the half?
Not at all.  Give me overtime!
Let's just get the real party started.  The finals!
