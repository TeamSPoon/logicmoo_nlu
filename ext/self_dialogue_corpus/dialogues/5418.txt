Have you seen the new Pirates of the Caribbean movie?
No, I haven't. Have you?
Yes, I really enjoyed it actually.
Really? Why?
I thought the story was actually a bit different than the others.
Were the same characters there?
Yes, and of course Jack Sparrow
I wonder how you could do it without him?
Johnny Depp was great as always.
He really made his career (again) in that role. I wonder what he could do in the future?
