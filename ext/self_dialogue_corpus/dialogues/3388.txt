Did you like Let Me In?
It was such a good film! I am glad you brought it up!
The themes in it were so real
Yeah bullying is an issue
And I think people neglect their children when they have money.
Yeah for real and thats why it was such a good horror film.
So you have that back story to know why they did what they did.
Exactly and you are on the edge of your seat.
