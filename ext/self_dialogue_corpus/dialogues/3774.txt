Have you ever seen the movie identity?
That's the one with John Cusack right?
Yea, the one where he's a detective.
Yea, and he get's stuck at that motel, when all that bad stuff has to happen. Except I don't think he's a detective anymore.
Oh yea, like he used to be or something.
Yea. Because Ray Leota played a cop in that and he was pretty much in charge.
Oh yea I remember now.
That ending was really crazy.
Yea I never would have guessed about the split personalities.
Same here, I had to watch it twice just to really understand everything.
