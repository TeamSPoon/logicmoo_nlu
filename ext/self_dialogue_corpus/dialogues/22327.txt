Hi.
Hello.
How are you.
Great, you?
Good.
So we're supposed to chat about movies?
Yea that is correct.
Okay.
What kind of movies do you watch?
I like all kinds really.
Is there a genre that you don't really like?
If I had to pick I would say horror.
Oh you don't like horror?
No not really.
What is it about horror movies that you don't like?
I really hate jump scares.
Oh yeah, horror movies are certainly filled with those.
I hate those so much.
Good chatting with you.
You too.
