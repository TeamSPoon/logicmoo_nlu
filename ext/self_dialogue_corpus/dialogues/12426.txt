When I was little I used to have nightmares about Darth Vader.
From Star Wars? Really?
Yes. He strangled someone using his mind.
I know! He was awesome!
You don't find that concept disturbing?
I guess it is. But he was an amazing swordfighter.
I heard a famous swordfighter did his scenes with the lightsaber.
My favorite character on the series was Leia Organa.
I didn't know her last name was Organa. She sounds like a character from Bewitched.
I know.
