What do you think was the biggest offseason acquisition this year?
Honestly it is hard to pick just one, there are so many players moving teams.
Well ok, pick one that you can think of that has some importance.
I think Brandon Marshall the WR signing with the Giants was a big deal
Him and Odell Beckham should make a good duo that is for sure.
Not just them being a duo, Marshall should take some pressure off people double teaming OBJ
Sterling Shepherd should have a decent season because of Marshall as well.
Him and the new TE they drafted should see plenty of looks based on how they spread the field.
The passing game seems to be there for the Giants, but the running game is still lacking.
Well Paul Perkins looks like he could be the starter with Rashad Jennings filling in. I am not sure on their ceiling though.
Shane Vereen has always been a good 3rd down back
He has, I am not sold on Perkins nor Jennings on being the bell cow of the Giants backfield
If I had to pick, I would say Jennings will be the top guy based on the fact he has been around the longest
That could be true but young guys are always looking to take their chance
How far do you see the Giants going?
I think they will finish 8-8. Eli Manning just isn't as good as he used to be.
Any other offseason moves you think are important?
WR Alshon Jeffery going to the Eagles is big.
That is a fact, he should prove to be a huge weapon for that offense.
Wentz should be a better QB because of Jeffery. Hopefully he stays healthy.
