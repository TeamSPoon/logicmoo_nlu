Are you doing anything Friday and Saturday?
No, not really. Why?
I was thinking about going to a free music festival on either Friday or Saturday, and wanted to know if you wanted to come.
FREE? Oh, I like free things! Yes, either day is fine. What kind of music is it?
It says both local and national bands. Some of them are Urban Tropic, Trevor Hall, Jack McIntosh and Company.
Where's it at?
Cincinnati, Ohio. It's at a top outdoor venue called Sawyer Point, and the festival is called Paradise on the Point.
And it's free? No admission charge?
Yep, it's free. Well, except of course for food and drinks at the vender stands, and beer.
Wow, count me in. I love free festivals because they attract a lot of people.
This one is being billed as all ages and a family festival where kids are welcome.
All ages, but they are selling beer?
Yes, it didn't say anything about having a sectioned area to drink, just that you had to be 21 to drink and there would be lots of craft beers.
It sounds really nice.
It looks gorgeous in the pictures. The stage is a half shell, and it's by a lake, with a grassy area.
There is nothing better than being outside in the summer time next to a lake.
There's what looks like a huge bridge nearby, and the picture was so pretty I could just imagine how nice it would be!
I like outdoor concerts because you can enjoy the sunshine and fresh air and scenery while you listen to the music.
It looks like a wide variety of performers, I was really interested in one called The Infamous Stringdusters.
We definitely have to check this out.
