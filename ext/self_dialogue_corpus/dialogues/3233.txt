Did you see the "Nightmare on Elm Street" remake?
Yes, I did.
What did you think about it?
It was not my favorite, to say the least!
I just can not see anyone else playing Freddy. Robert England is Freddy.
I agree with that. I just don't understand why they felt it should be remade.
I agree. Would it kill someone to come up with an orginal idea?!
I know! They are remaking all the classics.
Instead of remakes of perfectly good movies they could do more sequels, or just leave them alone!
I agree with that!
