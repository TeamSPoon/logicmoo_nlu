Did you know Cars 3 is out already?
I didn't even know they were making a third.
Yea, supposedly Lightning McQueen is old news and he's struggling to keep up with the newer younger racers.
Sounds like a few people I know!
I saw the trailer for it last time I went to the movies. It looks pretty good!
Is Mater going to be in this one too? I love Larry the Cable Guy!
Of course! You can't have Cars without Mater!
I'll have to go home and watch the trailer.
Or, better yet, let's go to the movies and watch it.
Sounds good! I'm free tonight around 8. See you then!
