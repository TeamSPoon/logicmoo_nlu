Awesome road trip so far. Let's turn on some music.
Sure, do you have a preference?
Something catchy and fast-paced.
How about some classics?
Ok cool.
Maggie May it is!
I love that song.
Me too. It's one of my favorites.
Rod Stewart is great.
I've been to 5 of his concerts.
Did you see the Voice episode where that guy sang Maggie May?
I haven't, was he good?
He was awesome. I loved his voice and energy.
Did he end up with a judge?
Yeah, Gwen Stefani picked him up.
Nice, was he a rocker?
Yeah, he started out in a garage band.
Cool, Gwen started out in a garage band, too!
Yeah, that's one of the reasons why he chose her. They had a lot in common.
It's a perfect match!
