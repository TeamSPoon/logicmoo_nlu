Do you like pop music?
Yeah I have a bunch of those Now CDs with pop artists.
Who is your favorite?
I like Britney Spears before she got all trashy.
Yeah I  like Oops I Did It Again.
She had some good hits.
Is Adele considered a pop artist?
I don't know- she is more soulful.
I really admire Adele's voice.
I secretly like Taylor Swift but she is so successful that I hate her too.
