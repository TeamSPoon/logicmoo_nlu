Remember the original Christopher Reeve Superman movie?
Yes, that was awesome.
I loved him as Superman.
Much better than today's movies.  I didn't care for Man of Steel.
Plus Gene Hackman as Lex Luther was good.
He brought a lot of comedy to the role.
Which was nice for the time period it was made in.
It was a little silly when Superman went backwards around the world to turn back time.
Yeah it was.  They shouldn't have killed Lois in the first place.
Other than that it was a pretty solid movie.
Yes, and the score by John Williams was good too.
Any time I think Superman I hear that song in my head.
I actually think the new guy is pretty good as Superman the movies are just bad.
I know, I hope Justice league is better.
I hope he's in it.  He died in Batman vs Superman.
Well we know he didn't die, but the DC Universe doesn't know that.
And at some time they'll have to bring in Green Lantern.
Yeah, and not the poorly done Ryan Reynalds thing either.
Which I believe is not part of DCEU.
Yeah, you're right.
