I was really sad when George Michael passed away.
Yeah, me too. We've lost too many legends over the past few years.
Like Michael Jackson. That was a hard one.
Honestly, I never really liked him much. I really miss Whitney Houston, though.
Yeah, she had a beautiful voice. I really like that song she did for The Bodyguard Soundtrack.
"I Will Always Love You"?
Yes. It's sad, but it's really romantic, you know?
I agree.
Gaps some of her earlier stuff was really good, too. Like "The Greatest Love of All"?
I was in elementary school when that song came out. We used to sing it in chorus.
I bet that was fun.
What other songs of hers do you like?
I really love the upbeat songs as well. Like "I Wanna to Dance with Somebody"?
Oh yeah! I haven't heard that one in ages.
"So Emotional" is another good one.
Really? I don't think I've ever heard it.
I'm pretty sure it was on that same album.
Oh, I never got the albums. Just heard what was played on the radio.
You should check it out sometime. I'll send you a link to the YouTube video if you want.
That would be great!
