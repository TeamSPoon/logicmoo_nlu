Was Chewbacca an Ewok?
No, he was a Wookiee.
Oh, so then Ewok is what those little bears were called in 'Return of the Jedi,' right?
Yup.  I never understood by the way, how a bunch of Ewoks defeated the Imperial Stormtroopers.
Apparently it was mainly a ploy for merchandizing to children.
I suppose children would love Ewok toys since they're basically teddy bears.
Speaking of Ewoks, which do you think is the scariest creature in all of the Star Wars movies?
I think that the Sarlacc that killed Boba was the scariest.
That is a good one.  Though I think the Rancor is easily scarier.
Well it was definitely bigger, and it almost killed Luke!
