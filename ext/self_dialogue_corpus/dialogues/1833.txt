Hey man, you think they're gonna pay Leveon Bell a lot this year?
I think they will, he's gotta be the best runningback in the league!
You don't think David Johnson is?
The Cardinals guy? I don't know much about him.
Exactly, the NFL doesn't showcase stars that aren't in prime viewing areas.
So why's he so good?
Well he led the league in all-purpose yards last year.
I thought Ezekiel Elliot did.
Exactly, that's all the NFL cares to talk about is the Cowboys.
Well ok then, so who is better, David or LeVeon.
Honestly it's a toss up, I think the kicker is the fact that Bell is going to miss games.
Like he did at the start of the 2016 season?
Right, the guy has a history of either getting in trouble, or getting hurt.  Neither of which I'm too fond of.
What is marijuana that he got suspended for at the start of the season?
Yeah, and I don't think Johnson has missed a game yet.
Isn't he young though?
Yeah, but I think that just adds to his attractiveness.
Where did Bell play in college, it feels like so long ago?
I'm pretty sure it was Michigan State.
Yeah, he was good then, but I never would have guessed this good!
