Did you know Star Wars has a lot of Japanese influences in it?
You mean the name Obi Wan Kenobi?
No, I mean how George Lucas was in love with films by director Akira Kurosawa, and seemed to outright copy parts of his films for Star Wars.
Oh, I didn't know that. I thought he had just made it all up himself.
Not only scenes and ideas, but also costumes that mimicked Japanese clothing.
Wow, so the credit for the ideas goes to a lot of other people.
There was one film people thought Star Wars copied, but it was the opposite- they had seen Star Wars and been influence by it, but their film came out first, making everyone think the opposite.
A lot of art- movies, music, painting, seems to have been influenced by things before it.
Star Wars was also influenced by Japanese anime and manga, but in turn also later influenced them.
So we have the Japanese to thank for Star Wars, huh? I bet a lot of people don't know that.
