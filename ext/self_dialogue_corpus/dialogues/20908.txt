What movies are on tv right now?
I looked a few minutes ago.  I couldn't really find anything
Hey, Shakespeare In Love is on.
Uggh.  Don't you dare.
What about.. let's see.. Blair Witch Project
That works. Make sure it's not the sequel though.
I take it you didn't like the sequel?
Have you seen it?  It made no sense.
How so?
I can't even explain it because of weird it was.  The characters did this and then couldn't understand what happened.
Uh huh..
And then they're like "Oh sorry, this may not have happened, this is what may happened." and then show you something else and you're just left confused as heck.
Anyone famous in it?
No and the first one wasn't either but at least it made a bit more sense.
How about The Odd Couple?
Oh, I didn't know that was on.
It just started.  I love the movie.
Me too especially when Walter Matthau picks up the linguini and throws it up against the wall and says "Now, it's garbage".
I love whenever they play poker with their friends.  They all just play off each other and it's hilarious.
Oh yeah.  Vinnie playing with his chips and talking about how he has to leave early but keeps winning.
