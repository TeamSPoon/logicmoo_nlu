Dude. Check out this trailer.
Wow, cars really has gotten dark.
I know right? Its really violent.
And whats up with the music? Did they really have to use dubstep?
I dont know, I think it kind of works.
Really, you think this fits a kids movie?
This isnt a kids movie anymore.
I weep for the youth of our future. The first one was so good and cute!
This is something brand new, better even.
I dont know if explosions mean better.
Oh come now, explosions make everything better.
But the techno music?
Necessary. its the gritty future!
I miss the gritty past.
You are too nostalgic.
What can I say, im a dreamer.
