I need to know: who do you like better, the Rolling Stones or the Beatles?
Definitely the Beatles.
Why?
Even though their career was relatively short, the Beatles showed such great range and experimented with so many different styles. I think their lyrics were so meaningful.
What are your favorite Beatles lyrics?
Probably "Yesterday". Though, there are lots of great ones.
Like "In My Life"? That one is so nostalgic.
Yes! I love that song, too.
I almost don't want to get started listing great Beatles songs. There are so many.
I know. What a great group.
