Did you hear that Bruce Springsteen is doing a month long stint on Broadway?
I heard that!  At first I thought he was acting in a play, but then I found out he is doing shows in a small venue.  I'm in!
I took my daughter to see Twenty One Pilots for her birthday.
I was there as well.  I have to tell you, I think I enjoyed the show more than my daughter did!
My birthday and anniversary are coming up and my husband surprised me with tickets to see Counting Crows!
That is great!  I know how much you love them.  Have a great time.
We are going to try and get tickets to see Katy Perry.  Faith really wants to go.  Does your daughter have any interest?
She would love to go!  Thank you so much for including her.
Did you hear the new Linkin Park record?  A lot of their fans are going to be really upset.
I did hear it. I didn't even know it was them at first.  I don't know why they went so different on this record.
U2 is playing Joshua Tree from cover to cover.  I bet that is going to be an incredible show.
I have heard really good reviews, but the ticket prices were so astronomically high.  I couldn't afford it!
My mom was going through some old pictures and she found a bunch of faded pictures of the Beatles at Shea Stadium.
She could probably sell them.  I know collectors would love to have them.
Do you still have all your old vinyl records?  I know you had a lot.
I still have my collection.  It ranges from Elvis Presley to Elvis Costello.  Last count, I had over 5,000.
I know how much you love music.  If you had to pick one artist, who would be your favorite?
I do love music.  I would say, by far, my favorite performer is still Bruce Springsteen.  I have seen him in concert 153 times so far!
Music had gotten so bad.  It is great to see that a few new bands are bringing music back to the roots again.
I agree.  I think The Chainsmokers, Coldplay, and Fallout Boy are really great and will help move music forward in the future.
