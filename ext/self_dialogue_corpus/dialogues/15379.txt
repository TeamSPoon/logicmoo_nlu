Have you heard of that song Florida Georgia Line?
Yes I love their music!
Some people aren't a fan of them I'm not sure why.
I think they accuse them of not actually being Country music artists.
Yes you're probably right.
I enjoy their music though.
I do too. I think one of my favorite songs is "This is How We Roll".
I love that one too a lot!
I play it over and over on my phone.
Me too. It's one of the best.
Their song "Cruise" is pretty popular too.
Yes, didn't Nelly also collaborate with them on that song?
Yes he did!
I thought so! They all did a great job on it.
I agree.
I would love to see them in concert one day.
I bet that would be amazing!
I need too look up when and where they will be touring soon.
That sounds like a good idea.
I'll let you know what I find out about them.
