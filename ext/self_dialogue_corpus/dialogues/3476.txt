So, I caught The Void the other night and I'm still trying to figure out what was going on with it?
Is that the new horror film with Ellen Wong, Kathleen Munroe, and Aaron Poole?
That's the one, it started out really creepy. Really mysterious and unsettling, then it gets really weird!
What do you mean? Was it a ghost story or more of an invasion horror movie?
It was more Love Craft if you're familiar with that genre. It's kind of similar to Clive Barker's Hellraiser.
Oh I loved that series! Tell me a little more about The Void.
It's a simple premise really, a group is trapped in a hospital in a small town. Outside there is a group of hooded members circling the hospital. They try to figure out how to escape but inside the hospital something even more sinister is happening.
That sounds pretty scary. Were there a lot of jump scares, because I can't do jump scares a minute type of horror films anymore.
There really wasn't a lot of jump scares but there was a lot of unsettling imagery. The practical makeup effects in this film are top notch, a real throwback to the 80's.
I'll have to give this movie a watch. I'm really intrigued by the practical special effects and makeup work. It's been awhile since we've had that, mostly it's been heavy CGI.
