What do you think is the funniest movie you've ever seen?
I think The Hangover is one of the best. Zach Galifianakis is perfect for his role.
Really? I thought it was a bit hyped up. I really think I liked him better in The Due Date.
I haven't heard of that. Who else is in it?
Robert Downey, Jr. is the other main character in the film.
Oh! Now it's ringing a bell. Robert Downey, Jr. usually does more action films.
That's true, but he was great in Due Date and also in Tropic Thunder.
Oh yes! Ben Stiller's in that as well, right?
Yeah, he is. You can't beat him in Zoolander though.
True. Zoolander might be one of my other favorite comedies of all time.
