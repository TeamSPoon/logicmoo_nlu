I would love to see Billy Joel someday.
I would too.
I heard he puts on a great show.
I know people that have seen him and said it is an incredible show.
I can imagine it is.
Always wanted to play the piano.
Play like him?
Well,not that good.
He's a one of a kind.
Yes he is.
Have you ever taken lessons?
I have taken a few.
Can you play anything?
I can play parts of songs. I can play the beginning of Let It Be.
Really? That's pretty cool.
That's one thing I always wanted to be able to do.
Love the beginning part myself.
I drove my wife crazy practicing it over and over.
I'm sure it took some time to get it down.
Yes it took me awhile.
