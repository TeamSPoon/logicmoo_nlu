Have you seen any good movies lately?
Yes, I watched a good one on Home Box the other night.
Which one?
Jason Bourne.
That is with Matt Damon, right?
Yea.
Was it as good as the other Bourne movies?
It sure was. There was a lot of action.
Who else is in that with him?
Tommy Lee Jones is in it.
Well then I know its got to be good.
Yeah, Tommy Lee Jones is a great actor.
I have liked all of his movies.
I especially liked how quirky he was in the Men in Black movies.
Yes, he can play so many different genres.
There were actors I recognized,but didn't know their names.
I am not great with names either.
I wonder if they are going to make another one.
Don't know, they always say they aren't and end up doing one.
Well action movies are always a good watch.
