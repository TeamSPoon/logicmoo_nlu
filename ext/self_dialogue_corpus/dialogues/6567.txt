Hey did you hear about the new Incredibles movie coming out?
Yeah I've been waiting for this movie since I was a kid!
I wonder if it will have all the same villains like Syndrome and the Underminer!
I don't know but I just hope they bring Edna back!
No matter what I'm going to be in the theater the day it comes out!
Same here, I've been waiting since 2004!
Pixar has really mastered the whole animated movie scene huh?
Of course! They keep making hit after hit.
There certainly is no slowing them down.
Yeah especially if they keep releasing continuations of old movies!
