Is it just me or are there a lot less huge hit family movies than when we were kids?
What about The Lego Movie or Inside Out?
Yeah, but I mean more live action. Like E.T.
Oh, I love E.T.
That's my point. There aren't really any more family movies that we would call a classic.
That's pretty subjective though.
True. Maybe it's more that I was a child of the 80s and therefore feel closer to those movies.
That's probably a big part of it.
There were a lot though: Back to the Future, Big, The Goonies, The Karate Kid, Honey I Shrunk the Kids...
Those were really great films.
And they were great for all ages. Movies today seem to be geared to one age group.
Except for the animated ones.
Yeah, and even though those can be entertaining for adults, they're not exactly made for adults.
I guess it would be weird to see a theater of just adults watching a Pixar film.
Maybe there are just more movies now so they get lost faster.
You mean like slip through the cracks?
Yeah, like it's harder to be a hit because everything has to compete with so much content.
It would be interesting to see how a movie like E.T. would do in the situation of today.
I'm not sure adult me would have been as touched.
Yeah, maybe not.
