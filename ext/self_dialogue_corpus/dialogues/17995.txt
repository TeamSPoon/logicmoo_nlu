Hey man, I have an extra ticket to the Dave Matthews Band concert tonight, do you want to go?
That would be great, I love them. The first CD I ever bought was "Before these crowded streets."
That is a great album. 'Halloween' is one of their best songs ever.
How much do you want for the ticket?
Don't worry about it, I just want someone to go with so I am not by myself. When was the last time you saw them in concert?
I saw them probably six years ago or more in Cincinnati, it was a great show.
Was Leroi still alive when you saw them last?
No, he had already passed away.I remember Dave talking about it.
How did you first get into Dave Matthews band?
My Brother went to school in Virginia, and he saw them a few times at a bar close to school, he and his friend traded tapes of their shows.
I heard that was a big way how they garnered new fans.
Yes. That is why today they let people record their shows In fact, you can find live versions of their shows on Dave Matthews Band message board sites.
I am amazed that the band allows that. Doesn't that take away from their profits?
I guess it might a little, but the thought is that people will hear a song or two, and then buy the album.
The show starts at 8:30, do you want to drive together?
Sure, come over to my apartment and I will drive us. Is there an opening band?
Yes, there is. OAR is the opening act.
I really like them too, I have seen them a few times.
It should be a lot of fun, I am glad you can come.
Thank you for asking me.
