Have you ever seen The Empire Strikes Back?
Probably, which one is that?
It's the one where, Darth Vader says, "Luke, I am your father".
Actually, that's not what he says.
Of course it is, everyone knows that line.
No, it's wrong. He says "No, I am your father."
Really?
Yep.
Well whatever, have you seen it or not?
Nope, but I read about that quote.
