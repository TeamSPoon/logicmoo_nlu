If you can only choose one hip-hop artist to listen to ,who is it gonna be?
it's gotta be Lil Uzi Vert
may I ask why?
well, simply speaking, his songs got good vibe, good company when I'm doing work
I'm not surprised, he got quite few songs on the top list of billboards
yea, what song you like from him?
I can't remember, but I'm listening to XO TOUR LIFT3 recently from him
oh, that's a very chill music, afternoon vibe
now that you mentioned it, I indeed feel it's an afternoon vibe, lazy and energetic at the same time
yes indeed!
