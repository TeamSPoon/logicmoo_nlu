Lil Wayne is the best artist out of New Orleans right?
I don't know. I like Big Freedia better.
Freedia is good but she's all bounce. Rap it a little different.
I suppose. I like Master P too.
Yes, he's good. What about C murder?
Oh, he's a little rough for me.
I also like Chance the Rapper. Chicago is where it's at.
Chance is great. I love Coloring book.
What about Kanye?
I love Graduation.
