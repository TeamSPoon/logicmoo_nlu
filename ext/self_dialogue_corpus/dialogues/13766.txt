I never realized how talented Lady Gaga.
I am a big fan.  I don't think people realize her talent.
I think I wrote her off when I heard songs like "Poker Face".  It made me think that she was just another pop star.
What made you change your mind?
Well, when I saw her performance at the Superbowl, I was intrigued.  Then, I looked up some of her live performances and I was hooked.
She is a great musician.  She can sing, play the guitar, and the piano.
I just finished listening to her last album Joanne.  Some of her songs made me think of David Bowie.
Which song?  Was it "Another Day"?
That is the one!  It's just a nice song to listen to.
She was definitely influenced by some artists from the classic rock era.  I could definitely see Bowie doing a song like that in the early part of his career.
