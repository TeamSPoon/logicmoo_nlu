Who do you think wins the NFC West this year.
It has got to be Seattle again.
Yes, it seems like this is a dynasty in the west.
As long as they have the key players on the roster they will be competitive.
I do not see the other teams in the division very competitive other then Arizona.
Arizona could be decent with Carson Palmer and the good receivers they have.
I think Seattle will still have a good defense as usual.
I agree it will probably be Seattle.
Arizona might be a long shot and might make the playoffs.
What about the other teams?
The Rams are a mess I don't see anything happening there.
Do you think Jared Goff starts.
I'm not sure if this kid ever gets off of the ground.
You think they traded away all those picks for nothing?
It could be a long time before that franchise turns around.
Think San Francisco will rebound.
I can't see anything happening with that quarterback situation.
Who is starting anyway?
Will is be Colin Kaepernick again?
I don't think he is on the team this year.  They will probably start Brian Hoyer.
