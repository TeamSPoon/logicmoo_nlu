Did you hear that Bruce Springsteen actually wrote a song for the first Harry Potter movie? It wasn't used though.
He did? Really?
Yeah. It was leaked on the 20th anniversary of the first Harry Potter book.
Is it any good?
It's okay. It doesn't sound like a classic Springsteen song though.
I'm not sure I know what a classic Springsteen song would sound like anymore anyway.
It was just a lot lighter. It was a weird thing for him to do.
I guess it's a good thing they didn't use it then?
Definitely. Songs need to make sense for the movies that they're in.
It's hard to put a good movie soundtrack together.
I like when they use a lot of classical. Like in Jiro Dreams of Sushi.
I like that too. I also like when an actor in the movie sings a song.
Does that ever happen?
Yeah. Haven't you seen Wild Wild West?
I haven't.
The theme song is sung by Will Smith.
Will Smith had a musical career?
Yeah! and he's actually pretty good.
I need to investigate this.
You're going to have a great time.
