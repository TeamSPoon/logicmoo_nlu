I finally saw Knocked Up the other day.
Wow, you must be really behind on your movies.
Indeed I am.  I'm a busy man.
What did you think?
My impression is that it was a solid film, but probably not quite so deserving of some of the hype.
Critics appreciated that it had a bit more drama to it than they anticipated.
Well, slightly.  I wouldn't call it dramatic by any means, maybe a bit more heart.
What did you think of Seth Rogen?
I don't think he was a total loser in the movie, but thought the actual hookup could have been better.
What do you mean?
I still don't really get how he picked up the girl.  She's hot, he's just average.
Can't that happen in real life?
It can, I guess, but it's not realistic.  That's my bone with it.
I actually didn't like her character in the movie.  She was very maddening.
That could have been because she was pregnant and her hormones were raging.
That's true.  I think they even call it out in the movie.
It had a tons of other characters from other Judd Apatow movies in it as well.
He seems to always cast his buddies.
Well, they probably work well together and don't cause stress on set.
And probably do a hefty bit of improv as well I'm guessing.
