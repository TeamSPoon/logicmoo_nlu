What do you think about the Harry Potter movies?
Wow, that's a big question. Aren't there 8 of them? Which one do you mean?
Well, which ones are your favorite?
I thought they started getting really good around the third movie.
Not a fan of the first two?
No. They were boring. The characters are too young to be interesting. Daniel Radcliffe and Emma Watson weren't interesting people until the third movie.
So the third it is, then?
Well, the third through the sixth. It started to fall apart after that.
Oh, why is that?
It was far too serious and about the villains by that point, I think. Snape killing Dumbledore was sort of the climax of the series.
