Do you like Disney's Little Mermaid movie?
Actually I do, a lot.
What do you like best about it?
I thought Ariel was so cute.
She was! A typical Disney heroine.
I guess the movie marked Disney's successful return to animated feature films.
Yes I heard that.
So my favorite song was Under the Sea.
It was funny to see the crab sing it
Yep.  And the whole undersea world was gorgeous!
