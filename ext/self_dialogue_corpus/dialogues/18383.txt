Have you heard Drakes music before?
I believe so, what are some of his songs?
His most popular is probably Hotline Bling which is fairly recent.
I've heard that one a lot and everywhere.
It blew up big time when it first came out.
Yes it did, any others?
Started from the bottom.
He made that song?
Yes he did.
That's one of my favorites I thought it was someone else.
Nope, definitely him.
That's awesome.
That might actually be his best song.
I couldn't agree more now that I know he wrote it.
I think he writes his own lyrics as well.
You sure?
Not one hundred percent sure but I believe so yes.
I've gained more respect for him now that i've learned this information.
Yeah he's not a bad rapper.
I agree now.
