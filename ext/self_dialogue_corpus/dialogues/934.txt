How about them St. Louis Rams?
Oh yeah? How about them Philadelphia Eagles?
You a Philly fan?
Yeah how about them Philly Eagles?
Nah, I'm a Pats fan.
All they cheat with deflated balls!
Oh, no, not that again!
Well they did cheat with, you all's quarterback got caught cheating deflating balls, so they'd be easier to catch.
No excuses, my Pats won
Yeah, only because they cheat!
I can't wait until the pats get another championship.
i would like to see them go against the Bears in the Superbowl.
Bears just not the same team they used to be.
I like them Buccaneers.
I like the 49ers.
I thought you were a Pats fan.
Well I also got a second house in the San Francisco area, so I'm a 49ers fan too.
Well then good for you.
You bet, I get all these teams to choose from because i have homes in many different cities.
i hope the bears make it this year to the Superbowl.
