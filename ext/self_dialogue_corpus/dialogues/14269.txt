The Wizards defeat the Celtics here in Game 4 to tie the series.
The series is tied at 2 a piece and game 5 will be in Boston on Wednesday.
Yup tune in at 8 PM on TNT.
Now its a best of 3 series, and Boston has 2 home games and only 1 away game.
Neither team has won on the road yet this series.
Lets see if the Wizards can take care of business Wednesday and secure the first away win of the series.
That Celtics crowd will be loud on Wednesday night!
Rightfully so, I think it will be an electric atmosphere, and they have every right to be.
Did you know the Celtics have gone down at least 20+ points in every game this series...
They are lucky to be tied in this series, and you'd have to imagine the Celtics would hopefully avoid being down 20 at home in game 5.
I like the Celtics chances, I definitely think this will go 7 games.
I do too... and I have no clue who would win Game 7.
I'd have to give the slight edge to the Celtics just because it will be at TD Garden in Boston.
Yeah but John Wall has been eating the Celtics alive, hes been so crafty, getting his teammates involved, scoring a ton of points and assists.
Only time will tell, I guess we will just have to wait and see. As we know the Cavs have already advanced to the eastern conference finals.
That will be a tough task for either of these teams as the Cavs are undefeated so far this postseason.
You got to think the Cavs will beat either team, and the Cavs will prob advanced to the finals.
Yeah I think I agree with you there, and I don't think the Cavs care who they get... Lebron seems to be on a mission this year again this postseason.
Well thank you for tuning in, again the Wizards have beat the Celtics thanks to a 26-0 run in the third quarter, to tie the series at 2 a piece.
It's been a pleasure to be with you guys, we will see you Wednesday night in Boston for game 5!!!!!
