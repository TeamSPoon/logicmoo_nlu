Do you listen to pop music?
Sometimes, I don't really like anything too ridiculous like most boy bands or bubble gum pop though.
Ha, I know what you mean. Do you like Halsey? She's popular lately.
I do actually, but not as much as a lot of people I know. I think I like her fashion and hair better than her music.
I like the song she did with the Chainsmokers.
Oh, closer? That was pretty good. The Chainsmokers have been putting out some hits lately.
I know, I like their song with Coldplay too. They do a lot of collaborations.
Yes, Something Just Like This. I like that song a lot.
What's their newest hit called?
It's called Paris. I like that one too.
