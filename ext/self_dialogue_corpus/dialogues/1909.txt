What is your favorite football team?
In the NFL or soccer?
The NFL.
It would have to be the Miami Dolphins.
Why is that your favorite team?
Because they had a perfect season.
But that was a long time ago.
And it has never been repeated.
It almost was.
By who?
By the Patriots.
But they didn't win the most important game.
They won other important games.
By cheating!
False accusations!
I'd do anything for the Dolphins to start winning again.
Even cheat?
No!
I used to like the Dolphins.
I used to too, still do, but used to too.
