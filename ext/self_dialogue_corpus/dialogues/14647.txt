So it does seem like we will get the Warriors and Cavaliers in the Finals again.
Yes.  This would be three straight years.
Which team do you think is the favorite?
Honestly, it's really hard to say.  I mean everyone is leaning towards the Warriors.
That is true.  But how can you really bet against LeBron James, especially after last year?
Yes.  And I think there is an argument that the Cavaliers are a deeper team than the Warriors.
I agree.  I think the Cavaliers quietly did a good job upgrading their roster this season.
Yes.  Everyone talks about the Warriors adding Durant, but the Cavaliers added a number of good players.
I think the addition of Kyle Korver is a huge advantage for the Cavaliers.
Yes.  They are able to surround LeBron or Irving with shooters at all times.
Exactly.  Very good shooters at that.
And Deron Williams playing the point guard position off the bench is a huge benefit for them as well.
Well we are discussing the Cavaliers right now, but what about the Warriors?
Well to be fair, the Warriors would probably have won last season if Draymond Green had not gotten suspended.
That is true.  They were up three games to one.
Yes.  But I think even with the addition of Kevin Durant, this team overall might not be as good as last year's team.
Interesting.  They did win less games than last season.
Yes.  And I don't think their roster is as deep.
That is fair, but I still think the Warriors will win the Championship.
Yes, I'd agree.  I'm leaning that way as well.
