I'm trying to decide which movie to get from Netflix. Any recommendations?
What's your favorite genre?
I like romantic movies. But not sappy ones.
OK, that lets out any Nicholas Sparks' movies!
Yes, I don't want to be manipulated and I don't want to cry.
Have you seen Pride and Prejudice? The one with Keira Knightley?
No. Is it good?
I loved it, even though a lot of Austen fans don't. I think it's a beautiful film.
I read the book a long time ago. Who plays Mr. Darcy?
Matthew Macfadyen.  He's really good.
OK. You've sold me.
Speaking of Austen, there's another movie I liked. The Jane Austen Book Club.
Is it romantic?
Yes, in a way. The various stories mirror the plots of Austen's novels.
I've never heard of it.
It has a good cast--Emily Blunt, Kathy Baker, Maria Bello.
Maybe I'll rent it and have an all-Austen party.
Well then you need to add Sense and Sensibility or one of the other movies based on Austen's novels.
These definitely sound better than most rom coms.
Make sure you invite me to the party!
