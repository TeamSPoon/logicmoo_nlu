I saw The Way the other day.
On Netflix?
Yes. It was amazing.
What do you mean?
It talks about living life to the fullest.
Great message!
It's about this guy who dies on a pilgrimage and his father.
Who's his father?
He's a professional man who goes to collect his son's ashes.
Then what?
He ends up taking the journey himself.
Where at?
Along the coast of Spain.
Who's in it.
Emilio Estevez is the son.
He's great.
Martin Sheen is the father.
They're related in real life too.
I think so.
They are for sure.
