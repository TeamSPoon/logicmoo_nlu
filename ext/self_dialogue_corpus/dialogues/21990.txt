So, what's your favorite movie?
Wow, that's a tough question. Well, a movie I've always really enjoyed and encourage everyone to watch in Cabin in the Woods.
Cabin in the Woods...... I think I've heard of that. Remind me what it's about?
It's about the kids who, well, visit a Cabin in the Woods. And I don't want to spoil it but it's not your average horror movie.
Who's in it?
Oh, Jesse Williams from Grey's Anatomy. Chris Hemsworth.
Oh! I do know that movie, directed by Joss Whedon?
Yes! Fun fact, the movie had been finished in like 2009, but it just didn't have the audience really to be released until 2012.
It makes sense, I mean you had to push hard for me to remember it.
It was just so good! You have to watch it. It will literally thwart any and all expectations you have.
Okay I'll watch it since I really do like Joss Whedon. Especially Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog.
Dude! I absolutely love that movie, I know like all the words to the songs!
Me too, and I think that's where I fell in love with Neil Patrick Harris, i.e. Dr. Horrible.
Yeah, he plays a really good bad guy. You know that movie was written in reaction to the writer's strike?
Oh really? That makes sense seeing as how it followed no rules.
True. Did you like Avengers once Joss Whedon signed on?
Joss Whedon did Avengers!? No wonder I liked it so much.
Yeah it was really good! And I don't even usually like superhero movies but this whole Marvel universe has sucked me in.
For sure, and the new Black Panther movie?
Oh don't even get me started.
