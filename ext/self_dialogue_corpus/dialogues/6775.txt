I got stuck watching Beuty and the Beast last week!
Poor you
Oh, it really wasn't too bad.
Is it the same as the original
It has some new music, but the story is the same.
At least something is new
The animation was really good
Better technology today
I disliked the new Gaston
The old one wasn't very likeable either
