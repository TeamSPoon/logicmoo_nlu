mac miller writes pretty good music
eh, not really. is it even pop music?
i think so. i definitely wouldn't consider him rap, no matter how hard he tries.
haha, wow. that's pretty harsh.
weekend is a good song or whatever, but it's obviously a pop song
it is pretty poppin
not like white guys should be rapping anyway you know?
you're right
imagine, he could be so good if he went in more of a pop direction
i think he's poppy enough as is
