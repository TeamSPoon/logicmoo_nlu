I am very bored, what about you?
Not really, I have just been listening to some music.
Cool, what have you been listening to?
I have been in a country mood today, so Travis Tritt is on right now.
I love him!  What is your favorite song of his?
I have been listening to Best of Intentions like all day!
That is a great song! My husband and I danced to that song a few nights ago.
It never gets old for me, especially when I am wanting to listen to a lot of country.
So you are a big fan of country music?
Yes I have always enjoyed country music ever since i was little.
Is Travis Tritt your favorite?
Not my favorite, but I do like him a lot.
Who would you list as your favorite country music singer if you could only choose one?
That is a very tough question!
It sure is, especially since there are so many great artists' in the country genre.
I would probably have to go with George Strait.
That is a great choice, he has sang many great songs.
Cowboys Like US is perhaps the best song ever made!
That is a great one, my dad used to love it as well.
He has several other good ones well, he is really talented.
