What do you want to see out of the NFL in 2017?
I would like to see another amazing playoff run.
Like the Patriots last year?
Well, they did well, but also similar to what the Falcons did.
Are you a Matt Ryan fan?
Yes, I think he is one of the best quarterbacks in the league.
I almost feel like he is underrated now.
This is probably true, especially living in Tom's shadow.
Everybody lives in his shadow, unfortunately.
I think that Aaron Rogers is the only one who might not.
But even Aaron only has one title.
Watch out for Green Bay this year - they are going to be mean.
Of course, but Jordy Nelson has to stay healthy.
This is true - but he had a phenomenal year last year.
Yes, he's been amazing every year he's stayed healthy.
He's one of the fastest players in the league, that's for sure.
Yes he is, and definitely faster than he looks.
Is that because he is white?
I guess so - but the man can hustle, that's for sure.
All cornerbacks seem to have a problem with him.
