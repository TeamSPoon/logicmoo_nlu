Did you see the new Rogue One movie?
Yeah, I thought it was pretty good, nothing spectacular.
Really?  I liked the main character.  I thought she was pretty cool.
I liked Rey better.
I'm really excited for the new one coming out this December.
I wonder if they're going to say who Rey is related to. Or if she's really just kind of a stand alone.
I think she's related to Obi Wan.
Yeah, I could see that.  It would be pretty cool.  I think Luke is kind of an obvious choice.
I'm pretty excited about the Han Solo movie I heard they are making.
Me too!  Han is one of my favorite characters.
