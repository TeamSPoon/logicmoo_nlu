what do you think about role of mia in fast and furious series?
What do you mean?
I mean is she necessary character?
I think she does have some role in whole story.
But what I am asking can the series survive without her?
I think the series can survive without her, but still she does play some role.
Anyways, there are lots of other characters which can be removed.
I do not agree, I mean many of those characters make the whole series more interesting.
I can agree to ron's character on that.
Oh yes, he makes the whole series amusing.
