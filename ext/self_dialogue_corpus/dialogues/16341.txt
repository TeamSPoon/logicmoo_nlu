What's your favorite current artist?
Not sure, I guess I would say the Black Keys.
Oh, interesting! They are from Ohio, right?
Yes, Akron.
Huh, interesting. Is there a lot of good music from there?
Of course, Akron is right outside of Cleveland.
What's Cleveland got to do with music?
It's the Home of Rock and Roll!
Oh, that's right, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame is there isn't it?
It is. They have inductions every year for new artists.
Cool Who was on the bill last year?
ELO, Joan Baez, Journey, Pearl Jam, Tupac and Yes.
Oh wow, that's diverse.
It is, they don't just honor rock artists.
That's interesting! I love Pearl Jam though.
Same. Did you hear about Chris Cornell?
Yeah, really sad! Seems like the last of the 90's grunge artists are on their way out.
Right. Still got Eddie Vedder though!
Do they still even tour?
Yep, they are on tour right now actually.
