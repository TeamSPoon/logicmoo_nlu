Do you think Rogue One was as good as the other Star Wars movies?
Yes, but it was very different from them.
How was it different?
The other movies focus on a specific group of heroes - like Han, Luke, and Leia. But Rogue One focused on ordinary people.
The cast of Rogue One was just as heroic.
But they were normal. They were pilots and soldiers, not Jedi.
Han Solo was just a pilot, too.
He was a super pilot - he was the best pilot, not "just a pilot."
I guess that's true. He made the Kessel Run in less than twelve parsecs, after all.
Whereas in Rogue One, all the characters were just ordinary. That gave it a lot different of a tone.
