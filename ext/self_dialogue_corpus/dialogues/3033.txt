I just think that Seattle has enough to still be great.
Yea, well they do if they can stay healthy.
Well, that is the case for every team. Health is always a major factor.
Yea, it is and it becomes more of one as players get older.
Yea, I agree. The Seahawks do have players that have been around a while, but they haven't had too many injuries
I agree, but they play hard and as they get older, I'm not sure what will happen.
Yea, well if they can't make noise this year, plenty of other teams will.
Well, if you're looking for good quarterback play, maybe the Packers have some magic in them.
Yea, I thought they were slowing down last year until they turned it on late in the year.
Yea, they sure did. Its like Rodgers just flipped a switch.
Yea, Rodgers can take it to another level and for that, you cannot count out the Packers.
Yea, I wouldn't count out Dallas either. They had a good team last year.
Yea, well that offensive line is fierce and they have a couple playmakers.
Yea, I agree. I'm just not sure whether or not they can take the next step.
Yea, young quarterbacks these days have what it takes to win early.
Yea, that puts the pressure on their young quarterback.
It does, but I think he may be able to handle it.
Yea, especially with the help of Ezeqquial Elliott.
Yea, it should be a wide open race in the NFC.
Yea, lots of teams.
