Hey! Just re-watched The Lion King last night.
That's my favorite Disney movie!
Disney during that period in the 1990's was amazing.
Right? So many great films.
Sad they took such a downturn afterwards.
Too much reliance on cheap, unnecessary prequels and sequels.
For real. Who needs Little Mermaid 2?
They've really started to pick it back up again, though. Tangled and Frozen are amazing.
I really liked Meet the Robinson's.
That was a very cute movie with a surprisingly sweet message.
Princess and the Frog was also nice. I loved the music.
Yeah, I wish they'd go back to hand-drawn animation more often.
I agree. Their computer stuff is nice, but nothing beats a nice hand-drawn film.
What do you think about them getting back into sequels? Like Wreck It Ralph 2 and Frozen 2?
Not sure. If the stories are good, it's fine.
Yeah, I really hope they don't lose focus of the fact that story is what's important.
They've done so great recently telling good stories. Moana was amazing.
So was Zootopia!
Yeah, it's great when Disney focuses on new ideas rather than sequels.
Well, let's hope their new renaissance continues to hold.
