Have you been paying attention to the NBA finals this year?
Yeah, but not constantly. I've mostly been watching on and off.
Yeah, me too. I don't really have a team in the playoffs, but it's still pretty entertaining and I pay attention sporadically.
Yeah, my team was in the playoffs, but they lost in the first round.
It happens. It makes it hard to get interested when your team isn't all that great.
Agreed. Which teams do you think will play in the championship series?
Probably Cleveland and Golden State, same as the past two years.
Yeah, that's who I think will make it. Which team do you think will win.
Probably the Golden State Warriors. The Cleveland Cavs are good too, but Golden State seems pretty unstoppable.
Yeah, I think the Warriors will win as well.
I kind of saw that coming, even before the season began.
Yeah same, it's kind of unfortunate that the NBA seems to be a little too predictable.
Yeah, going into the season, there's only like 4-5 teams that even I have a chance to win it all.
Yeah, I agree. There's 32 teams I think, but only a few have a legitimate chance to win it all.
Yeah, and it's hard to get into NBA basketball if your team isn't one of those 4-5 teams that has a chance to win it all.
My team had kind of a chance, but I figured they'd lose in the first round or two, so I wasn't super disappointed or surprised when they got bounced out in the first round.
Yeah, oh well, there's not much you can do. The Warriors are ridiculously good and the Cavs are good too.
Yeah, plus the Cavs have an easier path to the finals since the eastern conference isn't as stacked/talented as the western conference.
I think the Warriors will win, but I kinda want LeBron to get more rings.
I don't know, I don't really care either way. I just want to see a good finals.
