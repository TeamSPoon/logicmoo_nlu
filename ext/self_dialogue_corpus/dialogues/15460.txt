What was the first song you knew all the words to?
Hmmmm, I think probably Cat Stevens' "Father and Son."
Oh, I LOVE that song!!!!!!
So do I!  What's the first one you knew all the words to?
Genesis' "Time Table." I can still remember sitting under the kitchen chair singing it to myself when I was really little.
That's so cool!
I was a big Moodies fan, too.  I had On the Threshold of a Dream, and I listened to it all the time.
That's a great album!
Yeah, I used to love Dear Diary.
That and Lovely to SEe You!
I love Lovely to SEe You!
Me, too!
They did a pretty good job across their albums.
I think so, too. I don't think they hold up perfectly, but it's a lot of good music.
I agree. Heyward made a big difference!
Totally nothing without him.
What writing!
Yes. Pinder wrote some good ones. Ray Thomas was the only weak one.
I agree. Too cutsie.
Cutsie is perfect. A few good songs, but mostly cutsie.
