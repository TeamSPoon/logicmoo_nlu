Hey, do you know if Carson Palmer is playing another season?
I'm pretty sure he is. I think he really wants the ring.
Him and Fitzgerald both I guess.
Yeah, I think this may be their last season, though...
They they'd better get some young players and start grooming them for later
They really should get a few prospects now anyway. But I thought the back up QB was pretty good last season...
Yeah, I can't think of his name though...
Stanton? I think that was his name..
Yes, Stanton. He did good though.
Yeah, he was decent but we need another really strong starting quarterbacks.
And receivers, too. So, we basically need more offensive players.
At least we have a good running back. David Johnson is pretty impressive!
Yeah and he is young! Hopefully he will play for us for a while.
Let's hope so. We can't afford to lose him.
I can't wait till they have the draft!
Me, too, but it's always a bit nerve wracking...
I know, right? I don't want teams like Cowboys getting good players!
Ugh, I can't believe how good they were last season!
I know! And how bad the Browns were...ha ha ha!
Oh my gosh! I'd hate to be a Browns fan!
