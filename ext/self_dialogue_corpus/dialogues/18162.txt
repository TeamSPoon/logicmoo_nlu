What do you know about ethnomusicology?
The study of social aspects of music from around the world?
Yes, I have a paper due on that subject tomorrow.
Sounds rough. But, I can probably help you.
Thanks! What do you know?
I good place to start is Pygmy music.
You mean the African tribes who are unusually short?
Yes, they make wonderful music.
I didn't know that!
Very few people do.
What's it all about?
They believe that the forest is kind of like a parent. And, that music is the best way to communicate with their parent.
Wow, that's really interesting!
I know. They have a couple of music techniques they use to communicate.
What are those music techniques?
One is singing. They have this really ususual way of singing. It's very high pitched.
What's the other music technique of the Pygmy tribe?
It's called liquindi, and it's more often practiced by females.
I see. What's involved?
It's a form of water drumming. It uses the combination of water and air to make beautiful music.
