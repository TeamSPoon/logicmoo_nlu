Who do you think is the best player in the NBA right now.
I think I have to go with Russel Westbrook.
Really? He had a great season but he's a ball hog.
But he averaged a triple double this season. No one has done that since Oscar Robertson.
Yes I understand that. But Lebron is Lebron.
Lebron also has a team full of stars. It's only Russ on the Thunder.
But Russ doesn't have a championship mentality . That's why KD left.
KD just wanted a ring. If he would have stayed on the Thunder his time was coming.
Yeah but he didn't want to get older and have to team travel in order to get a ring. He looks good with the Warriors.
Realistic though Russ is by far the best in the league. Look at his stats.
Stats don't get you wins.
True but he's having an historical season. We might not see this in our lifetime again.
I don't know. I just think that the Thunder are just letting Russ get these stats.
Have you even seen the Thunder play this year?
No!! But I been watching highlights on ESPN.
My point exactly. I have the NBA league Pass. We can watch the game when they play the Heat and you will realize his skill.
Don't get me wrong I like Russ like I said but I'm not interested in one man basketball.
You know he's average a triple double in points, rebounds and assist right?
Yes I am aware of that.
Well how can you play one man ball if you are averaging more than 10 assist a game?
