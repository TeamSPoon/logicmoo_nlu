I never understood why Anakin got so upset.
It was a bad part of the first prequels.
It was just silly how bipolar he was.
Yeah.  One moment, he gets mad at the queen, next moment says he can't live without her.
It really hurt the movies how he went back and forth.
And killed any momentum of him being emotionally battered.
Right.  The fact that he killed her still rubs me the wrong way.
They did not film it very well.  It's probably why the prequels are kind of not talked about much.
They'll never remake them, but I wish they did.
Me too.  Can't erase the past though.
