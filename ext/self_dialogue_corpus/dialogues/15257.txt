Hey, what do you think of electronic dance music?
I really like it, but I dont like how closely it is held with drug use.
Yeah, most people who listen to it regularly know that it is all about the music and not about the drug use.
Thats good to hear.
It realy gets my blood pumping with the constant bass that it has.
Yes, bass is the focal point and I love bass.
The progression of the songs really gets me too.
What do you mean.
Well, how it starts soft and builds.
Then drops and goes craz, right?
Right!  Its not a constant high all of the time.
Well, some genres of electronic dance music are.
Lke what?
Like hardstyle to me is pretty hard core all of the time.
Yeah I guess so,
Trance is also pretty mellow most of the time.
Does it bother you that the music mostly doesnt have words?
Not really.  I never listen to words anyways
Same here.
I feel like most people just like the flow and how the music makes them feel.
