Do you think the position of running back is a dying breed?
Yeah for the most part.
I mean you have your Ezekiel Elliots in the league
No I think he is one of a kind
Oh for sure but I meant like there are probably a handful of every down back
What do you think is the reason for that?
I am not sure maybe the league has gone to a passing league.
Yeah that could be the culprit
And I dont think teams see value in a bruising guy holding the ball
They did it for plenty of years.
So would you ever draft one high?
No I think you need to get your RB in the 3rd round of the draft.
So how do you justify taking one in the top 5.
I guess if he is generational
But thats all based on conjecture isnt it?
The entire draft is predicated on that.
So Elliot was worth the investment, right?
Yeah but theres always the 2nd year slump
Could you see that happening to him
With his line in front of him it would be hard
