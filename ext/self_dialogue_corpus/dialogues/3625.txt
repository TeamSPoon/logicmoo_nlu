Do you like scary moves? My all time favorite scary movie has to be the original "Amityville Horror".
Absolutley, that house was crazy. I couldnt imagine living there. It looks creepy to begin with.
My favorites are those that could be real. You know dealing with paranormal.
Oh so like the "Exorcist" too?
Yes, calling in the priest, and then stabbing the crucifix in her private part. Terrible, but wicked.
I would hate to have been that preacher. Neck turning all the way and projectile vomiting.
It was pretty gross. Or how about the move with that little lady who talks in the baby voice. It's creepy.
Poltrigiest? That one?
Yess, that movie scared me so bad when i was little. I was scared of elevators and bath time after that.
You better watch a cartoon before you go to bed tonight or the little lady will come to you through the tv static!!! Just kidding
