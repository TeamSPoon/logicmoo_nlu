Have you heard any of Lady Gaga's new album?
I've heard a couple of the singles - 'Million Reasons' and 'The Cure'.
It's okay. I'm disappointed, to be honest.
Oh really? Why?
It just isn't as catchy and poppy as I expected from Lady Gaga.
She did a whole swing album, didn't she?
Yes, with Tony Bennett. She's really branching out.
She seemed kind of the same as always at the Super Bowl performance.
She only performed the big hits, most of which are quite old.
She was so huge a few years - her music was EVERYWHERE.
