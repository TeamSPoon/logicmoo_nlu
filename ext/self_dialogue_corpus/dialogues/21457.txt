Do you think that David Lynch will ever make another movie?
I don't know! He has been busy with Twin Peaks lately.
I know. But I love his movies and want more from him.
Which one is your favorite?
Probably Mulholland Drive. Naomi Watts is amazing.
Oh, she is great. She takes on a lot of interesting roles.
Yeah, she does. I also love her in I Heart Huckabees.
She is so funny in that movie!
That's a great cast. They're all amazing.
Oh my goodness, you're right.
Dustin Hoffman steals the screen in that one.
He really does. He plays the goofy professor type so well.
He did it in Stranger than Fiction too.
Oh, that's the one with Will Ferrell, right?
Yeah, it was such a shift for Will.
I like seeing him in a comical yet serious role.
I know. He tends to stick to the same sort of character so that was a departure for him.
I would like to see him take on more of those roles.
Me too. I think he's really talented.
Even as a goofball, he is always entertaining.
