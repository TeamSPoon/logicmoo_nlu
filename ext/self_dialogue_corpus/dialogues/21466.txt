Hello, there friend have you seen Toy Story?
Yes its a great movie my kids love it.
Who is your favorite character?
I would have to say Buzz he was the best toy after all , right?
No I would have to say Rex was the best and Woody.
I think the Toy story movie had a great moral to the story.
Yes it did just because you have a new toy can't forget about the rest.
Indeed. How long ago did this movie come out.
Oh gosh i wanna say at least 20 years ago.
Yeah, I remember watching it when i was a child very educational.
I like Sid in the movie.
Yeah he really made the movie entertaining.
I wish there were more movies like this out now.
Well there is a Toy Story 2 as well.
But I don't think that one was as good as the original.
Why do you say that?
Because it was not that unique and entertaining like the first one?
Very valid point.
Tim Allen and Tom Hanks did a great job .
Yes they did will love this movie forever
