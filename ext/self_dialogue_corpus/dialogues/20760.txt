Do you prefer to watch old movies or new ones?
I guess I like both, some of the old ones remind me of how things used to be but the new ones make you think about how things might be in the future.
The ones that try to show the future are usually frightening, the buildings are blown up and everyone's starving.
Well some of them we all live on a space ship.
Well I do have to say the science fiction movies are better today..
Especially when they have monster or aliens, they no longer use painted lizards.
I think Star Wars really improved the way syfy movies were made when it comes to graphics and characters.
I remember when my husband and I went to the theater to see Star Wars it was mind blowing.
I know, all of the action and it had a great story line.
Plus having two great looking men as the stars did not hurt.
Harrison Ford and Mark Hamill were great in that movie.
Hans Solo and Luke Skywalker are the greatest names for characters ever.
Princess Leia was a cool name also, and Carrie Fisher did a good job.
Well let's not forget Chewbacca, Yoda and Darth Vader.
And the robots C-3PO and R2D2.
That movie had so many great character names.
The more characters the more toys you have to buy the kids.
Can you imagine how much money the Star Wars Trilogy has made.
I can't even. I know my kids had a lot of them.
Mine too and now we are buying them for the grandchildren.
