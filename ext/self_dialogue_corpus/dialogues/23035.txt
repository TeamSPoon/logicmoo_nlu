Hey, what are you up to?
Nothing much, watching a movie at the moment.
Cool. What are you watching?
Currently I am watching through the Batman series.
That sounds interesting, which one are you on?
I am currently watching Batman Begins.
Oh, those are the new ones. Have you seen the originals?
I haven't seen the classics but I did watch through the 90's Batman movies.
Those are actually some of my favorites but the new series is at the top for sure.
Ya they are some of my favorites. I love how Christian Bale played the part.
Ehh he was just OK in my book but overall I liked how the movie turned out.
Ya Heath Ledger put on one of the best performances I've ever seen.
Ya it's a shame that he died. It was too soon.
For sure. I still wonder what actually happened surrounding his death.
So do I but we will never know for sure.
I think that overall there has never been a better joker.
Well they all bring something different to the table but he played more twisted role.
That's exactly why I liked him. That is the character I picture when I see the Joker in my mind.
Well not all people like that sort of thing.
To each their own. It's what makes this series one of my favorites.
