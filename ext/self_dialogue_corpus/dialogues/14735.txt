Have you ever seen Caddyshack?
I actually hadn't seen it until a few months ago.
What did you think about it?
I actually loved it.
What was your favorite part?
I mean, the most classic part had to be the candy in the pool.
Oh, yeah, that was funny.
The whole movie was funny though.
I mean how could it not be?  Bill Murray and Chevy Chase were in it.
Yeah, a true classic.
