I've really been wanting to get into jazz, but I'm not sure where to start.
Hmm. Well, why do you want to listen to it?
I like the jazz I've heard in snippets, but I don't know very much about it.
Well, I'm not an expert, but I have some artists I like.
Like who?
Well, I'm pretty big on Duke Ellington. I especially like "Star Crossed Lovers."
I've never heard of that, but I could give it a try.
Then, I feel like Nat King Cole is a must.
That's a name I recognize, at least!
Also Miles Davis. Maybe starting with "Blue in Green."
You said you didn't know much about Jazz, but it seems like you know a lot.
I'm actually surprised at myself, I didn't think I did!
Well, I appreciate it.
What kind of music do you usually listen to, if it's not jazz?
I'm actually very big into classical music.
Could you give me any recommendations?
Well, I really like Liszt's piano concertos.
Could you lend me a CD?
Only if you lend me some of the jazz you like.
It's a deal!
