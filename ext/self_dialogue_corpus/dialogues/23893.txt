I'm looking for some good movie recommendations. Do you have any?
Yeah, 10 Cloverfield Lane
I don't recall hearing about that one
It's a good one. A good thriller.
Any big stars in it?
John Goodman is the biggest star
Oh I really like John Goodman.
Yeah, he plays a bad guy in it.
Oh that's not fun. I like him when he plays good.
Well he's kind of complicated character in the movie.
Is it a horror movie?
No, more of a thriller. There are some jump out of your seat scenes though.
Oh I don't do well with those types of movies.
It's not that bad though. Just a few scenes.
Okay, any light moments?
Yeah, there's some scenes worth a few laughs.
Okay, I'll check it out.
Yeah, the ending is kind of lame, but the rest of the movie is good.
Okay good to know. Thanks.
You're welcome.
