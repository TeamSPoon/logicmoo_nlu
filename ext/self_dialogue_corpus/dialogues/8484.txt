I know you're not a fan of pop music but I really want you to come to a concert with me.
i despise pop music! I would not be caught dead at a pop concert.
No one else will go with me! I have asked everyone.
Well, who do you plan on seeing?
Kelly Clarkson! You know she is my favorite artist!
Isn't she the girl that won American Idol?
Yup. She has a really good voice. I think you will have fun.
If I go to the concert you can buy my ticket. I am not paying money to attend a pop concert.
You have yourself a deal! You will love her Slid Shady cover by Eminem.
I am already regretting my decision!
