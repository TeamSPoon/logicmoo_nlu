Did you see the trailer for the new Deadpool movie.
It looks like it will be really good.
I hope they live up to the humor in the first one.
I loved the mix of humor in that one.
I liked that it went dark, but also had sort of slap stick jokes too.
I liked the line about the avocados.
I liked the way he movie made fun of the whole Marvel universe.
It made me want to see a cameo about Wolverine in his movie.
He does make a lot of jokes about Logan in the movie.
How funny would that be if they were in the same film?
I wish they would do a whole Marvel cross over movie.
Like the Avengers, but mix who else?
I would like to see Deadpool, the Avengers and maybe even Guardian's of The Galaxy.
That would be amazing.
Maybe even mix in Doctor Strange.
He is going to be in the newest Avengers!
What! That is amazing.
I can not wait to see him and Spiderman have a funny conversation.
Do you think they will keep this actor as Spiderman for a while.
I hope so, I am sick of having to see new versions of his aunt.
