So, you know, it might sound crazy but I really enjoyed Batman v Superman.
That's okay, you can like it, but a lot of people didn't.
Yeah, critics hated it. They really went to town on it.
I remember the freaking out people did online about it.
They were either really happy it was badly reviewed, or really angry.
Fan wars are the worst. Good or bad, the film was bound to upset some people.
And that's even if it wasn't such a dark, deconstruction of superheroes.
It really does feel like a Watchmen sequel in some ways because of that.
I suppose it's not a surprise then that Zack Snyder directed both films.
It shows. If nothing else, the man has a visual flair that's unique to him.
I saw that 300 sequel they made, and he didn't direct it.
Oh, yeah? Who did?
You know, I don't remember, but whoever directed it tried to mimic his style, and they came close, but they didn't quite pull it off.
That's not surprising. He makes it look easy, but making every frame look like a shot out of a comic can't be.
Right, the way certain scenes are composited and stuff, looks straight out of a graphic novel.
Well, I suppose if nothing else Batman v Superman might win the award for prettiest comic book movie.
Well, it is pretty, it really is, but it's good in other ways too.
Most people would disagree, though, I'm indifferent to it.
At least we can both agree that we hope Justice League turns out good, right?
I have low expectations, but high hopes. Fingers crossed.
