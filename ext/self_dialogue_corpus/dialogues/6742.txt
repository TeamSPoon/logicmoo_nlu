Did you know mary poppins was a disney movie?
I didnt realize that
Yea it is, and hands down the best disney movie ever
Definitely, i love it
I still have the songs stuck in my head
Me too
I liked that scene where they jumped into the  street art
Me too, i also liked the chimey sweep song
That one was fun
The whole movie is great
