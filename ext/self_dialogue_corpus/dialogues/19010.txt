What do you think of Coldplay?
That's a great question. I used to love them.
Seriously?
Yeah. They write really good melodies. Their production is always fantastic.
That is true. Brian Eno produced Viva La Vida.
Exactly, they always get great producers. But it was around that album actually that I changed my mind.
Why was that?
Well up until Viva La Vida they had really solid songs, I still think that. But after that. I couldn't stand their new stuff.
You think it was worse than the older songs?
Definitely. Think about it.
Think about what?
When they first started off, like their first few albums- their songs actually had lyrics.
Yes, they did have lyrics. What's your point?
Well, as they kept releasing albums, their songs started being mostly  the word "woah" or "ahhhhh" or "oooooh"
Wait, you're right.
Yeah. Like every song since then has been some sort of nonsense chorus.
Now that I think about it, totally. Chris Martin just throws in a lyric like, "I sing" before the nonsense, and then there are no lyrics after that.
Yep. So yeah, I used to like them.
And now they sing nonsense songs.
Every single one.
