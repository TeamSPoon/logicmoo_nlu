Hi, have you heard the new Art of Anarchy CD?
I think I heard one of the singles from it, sounded good.
I really love the album, quite a band, lots of experience!
Anyone I'd know?
Probably, there's Ron "Bumblefoot" Thal, from Gun's n Roses, John Moyer from Disturbed, and Scott Stapp from Creed.
Wasn't Scott Weiland in that band?
He sang with them, but evidently didn't consider himself part of the band.
He died, didn't he?
Yes, and it was later the next year before Scott Stapp joined them.
So who do they sound like most, do you think?
I think Scott Stapp described it accuately as "So, it's like Disturbed meets Guns N' Roses, meets Creed."
That's d be band I'd like to hear!
The music is good, and Scott sounds great, I think it's a good mix.
Think they'll hang together as a band?
Time will tell; I suppose part of it will depend on what else the bandmembers have in the works.
You have a favorite song on the album?
That's a lot like asking me if I have a favorite child!
Tough decision?
No kidding! Guess I might go with "Echo of a Scream."
Sounds like I need to give that album a listen!
