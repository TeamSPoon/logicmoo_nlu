Do you have any recommendations for Electronic pop?
I sure do! What are you in the mood for?
Something fun and upbeat
Then I recommend Owl City, he has some fun and upbeat songs.
Owl City? I don't think I've heard of him.
His real name is Adam Young.
Oh yeah, I've heard that name before..He sings fireflies right?
Yes, Fireflies is a great song, you should check out some of his other stuff like Vanilla Twilight.
Sounds like something I might like, I'll definitely have to check it out.
If you end up liking that song The bird and worm is one of my favorites as well.
Alight, I also like that one song he did for Wreck-It-Ralph
When can I see you again?
Yes, it gets stuck in my head every time I listen to it!
He does a lot of songs for movies.
He did a great song for The Legends of the Guardians.
I love that movie, that song is good too .
I'll have to listen to a few of his albums.
Ocean eyes is the best album ever...In my opinion anyways.
Okay, Ocean Eyes it is!
I think you're going to love it.
