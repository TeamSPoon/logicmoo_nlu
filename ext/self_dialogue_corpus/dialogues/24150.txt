Did you ever see the Rocky Horror Picture Show?
Wasn't that a comedy musical or something like that?
Yeah, it came out in 1975. Susan Sarandon and Brian Bostwick were 2 of the main characters.
I remember that movie. Tim Curry stole the show! He was the "sweet transvestite from Transsexual, Transylvania."
Did you know Richard O'Brien was living as an unemployed actor in London during the early 1970s and wrote the movie just to stay busy?
No I didn't. Wasn't he the greasy haired butler in the movie?
Yeah, the big lurchy guy. Creepy.
It is a very weird story, but I think the weird part of it all is the audience interaction.
I don't recall any of that. What do you mean?
I've seen it in theaters a few times and there were preparations that had to be made. We made a ton of toast. Yeah kind of wasteful!
Toast? What did you need that for?
In the beginning scenes as the movie unfolds, the crowd chants different different things. Like during the opening song people will chant "Let there be lips."
Really? What did you do with all your toast?
Oh that you throw up in the air when the "toast" happens in the movie. Or at least they did when I saw it.
That would make a mess. Glad I didn't have to clean that up.
Yeah, I'm sure the movie theater people hated that.
Yeah, there'a a good bit of profanity and lots of sexual innuendo but it's fun.
It kind of sounds like it might be. Especially if you are in on all participation.
Yeah, it was a lot of fun. Especially since we would go to midnight show. Get out in the wee hours of the night and go hunt for a Waffle House.
Now that part sounds good.
