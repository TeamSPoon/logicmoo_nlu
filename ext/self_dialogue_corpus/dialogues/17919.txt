Man we slost some good musicians in our lifetime.
I know right.
I'm sitting here listening to Barry White on The Secret Garden.
Awe man, that thing is fire. Quincy Jones outdid himself when he put that together.
He had Debarge on there, Al B Sure, James Ingrahm.
That's one of my favorite slow jams.
I like that and I like some of Gerald Levert's music.
Another one gone too soon.
Man I remember when Gerald hooked up with Keith Sweat and Johnny Gill.
You talking about LSG. That jam they had, what was the name of that jam?
My Body All Over Your Body. Pure Fire.
That was the first time three huge solo artists had hooked up to form a group.
It worked. They had a few hits.
I know right. Then you had Tyrese, Genuine, and Tank trying to form a big-3.
Yeah, they didn't last. And they songs were corny.
Tank didn't need them two. He blew up after that trio broke up.
I like that joint You're My Star.
He had a whole tour off of that album that year. What was the name of that album?
Stronger.
Yeah that's it.
