Don't you feel that the beginning of the NFL season puts you in a festive mood?
Somewhat...Football season feels like a long Holiday season.
How divided is your family in regards to their favorite teams?
Oh wow! Half the family are Dallas fans and the other half are Redskins.
Really?...Thanksgiving must be Hilarious? There is always a Redskin & Cowboys matchup.
Yes it is. After dinner and during the game it's a divided family room but you love every minute of it.
Isn't it crazy how Football can tear your family apart one minute then heal you in the next?
It's awesome, our family has always been divided in the NFL. But, if it's none of our teams in the Superbowl we always celebrate Superbowl Sunday together.
What team do you go for Redskins or Cowboys?
Redskins Baby!
I like the Redskins also but their quarterback needs to improve his game this season.
I agree, but he also need more help from his offensive line.
Who won the game last Thanksgiving with the Redskins and Cowboys?
Them girls did...aka the Cowboys.
The girls?
Yeah...we call them girls with their pretty tights, it's all good!
Do you like to watch football games outside on inside?
I love the dirty side of football, it should always be played when it's cold and rainy.
Do you personally know anyone that plays in the NFL?
No, but I did have a cousin that went from college to the Baltimore Ravens practice squad but he never made the cut.
