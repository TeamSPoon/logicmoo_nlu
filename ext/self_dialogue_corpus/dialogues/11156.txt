Who was the best dressed at the Dior Fashion show?
Rihanna for sure, did you see her dress?
I loved her cowboy hat and her furry dress.
Did you see Charlize Theron's outfit?
I did! It was to die for.
Her head to toe black ensemble was stunning.
I liked her shades!
I know! I want to steal them for me!
What about Demi Moore?
She also wore black with a long skirt.
She did! She had the country vibe going for her.
I also liked Brie Larson's outfit!
She is a blonde bombshell!
Her black suit jacket was sleek.
And her patterned skirt! That was one of my favorites.
Let's talk about Kiernan Shipka and her dress!
I am in LOVE with her black velvety dress!
Me too! So sophisticated.
And that choker!
It completes the outfit entirely.
