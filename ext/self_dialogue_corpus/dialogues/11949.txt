Who is your favorite member of the band?
That't a tough question, either John or Paul.  Whats yours?
Probably John.
Why John?
He had the most potential, though the post Oko years were a little odd.
But he had some of his best music after he met her.
Like what?
Imagine for one!
Oh, I forgot about that!
Yes, its one of the best songs of all time!!
