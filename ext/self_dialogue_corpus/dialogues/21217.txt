Have you seen that animation "Storks"?
Yeah, I did. What did you think of it?
I was really surprised and laughed out loud.
Me too. Though I thought the plot line was pretty typical.
Yeah, I guess it's your typical layout but they got some really clever scenes in there.
I thought so too. What was your favorite part?
It was just kind of a chuckle until the wolves showed up!
Aww, man! That was favorite too!
Did you recognize the voices?
Key and Peel, right? Those guys are so funny!
I love how they totally played off the Wonder Twins powers!
Oh I know!
You know "shape of a submarine"
Yeah and then all those wolves do the magic of turning in to sub, or plane or a boat!
It was crazy how they "magnetized" together!
The faces on those guys were great too. Those wolves were snarling and wincing.
I love the initial stand off. "I'm going to be the Alpha."
Yeah and so typically the other guys "No I'm going to be the new Alpha."
"No it's going to be me." Those guys are so funny.
They are they totally make that movie. I don't know how they come up with stuff. It's great!
