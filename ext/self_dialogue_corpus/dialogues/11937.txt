Do you know when the Beatles will be making a comeback?
I don't know man. They are old and lazy now. I they all retired.
They retired? I didn't know that. I thought they still go on tour.
Paul McCartney still does concerts, but he does them as a solo act.  Yes, they broke up years ago and retired the band.
Why'd they do that?
Its a complicated story. One of the main Beatles wanted to go solo, and that caused the dissolution of the band.
Why did he want to go solo?
I don't know. But most of the time when a group member wants to go solo, it means that he or she leaves because of money reasons.
Money reasons? What do you mean by that?
Yeah, he probably thought he could make more money if he went solo. I think it was John Lennon, who left the group first.
