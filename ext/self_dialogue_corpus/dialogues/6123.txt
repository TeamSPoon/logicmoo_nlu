I was reading an article online the other day about the new Disney movie Star Wars Episode 8 that's coming out at the end of this year.
It's amazing how popular Star Wars is. It's one of those franchise movies that seems like it will never end.
People will probably be really nostalgic about it since Carrie Fisher died this year.
I think people will always think of her as Princess Leia.
I was thinking about how it was kind of depressing when I read about the new movie.
Star Wars is depressing?
I saw the very first Star Wars when it came out in 1977 at a drive-in movie theatre.
Wow, that was 40 years ago, and drive-ins are practically extinct.
I know, and Carrie Fisher was only four years older than me and now she's gone.
I can see why the movie might make you kind of depressed!
