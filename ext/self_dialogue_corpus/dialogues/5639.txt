Have you seen the Moana movie yet?
No. How is it?
It was really great. I tought my daughter was going to like it, instead it was was son who loved it.
Wow cool. Then it must not be very girly.
The characteres appeal to everyone. Especially Maui, the main male figure.
I heard something about a stow a way chicken. Is there one?
Yes! Hei hei is his name. Crazy chicken.
Looks like I will have to rent this movie.
Or Just buy it! There are a lot of great songs in the movie too.
Great! More music to get stuck in my head!
