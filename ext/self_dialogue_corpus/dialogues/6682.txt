I loved the new Beauty and The Beast movie. Have you seen it?
Eww, absolutley not. Nothing could be better than the original. And tell me how will the clock and candle holder be real?
They get it done, i promise. Emma Watson is a perfect Belle.
I wish they would make a remake of Lion King, and not in the musical way. But a real actor play.
I dont know if i could take that in real life. I love the cartoon movie, and a dead Simba's dad would make me cry. I am a softie.
Haha, it would be fake though. I would love to see someone play Timon and Pumba. "Akauna Matata"
"It means no worries for the rest of your days!" That was one of the best parts of the whole movie.
That, and when Rakifi holds up baby Simba and it goes, aaaaaayaaaananenenenenam
Nice spelling singing there. I guess a new Nala and Simba could come to town and I would go watch it.
I would be the first one there, hoping JTT still plays Simba. Nineties crush forever.
