Have you ever seen The Shining?
The original with Jack Nicholson? Of course I have.
It's actually my favorite horror movie of all time.
What do you like so much about it?
Well I love Stanley Kubrick's directing, the symbolism in it, the suspense, everything.
I saw a documentary on it once about the subliminal messages Kubrick put in there.
Was it called The Shining Decoded? I saw that.
Yes and there's another one called Room 237 that went into a little more detail.
I'll have to check that one out. That scene in the maze was pretty terrifying.
Oh I know, that one and the one where he was chopping down the door.
