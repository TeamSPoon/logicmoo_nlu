Did you see that war movie Fury.
Yes it was great.
I loved the beginning when the nazi was riding along and got knocked right off his horse and knived in the head.
Oh yes that was great, but how about the panzer fight.
Yes the Panzer fight was cool, but that german machine gun just chopping off soldiers leg was wicked.
Yes that was graphic for my taste.
Then those poor nazi in the building they shot white phosphorous in was cooking.
Yes I think the gunner took pity on them when he shot them.
I hated to see them all, die.
At least the kid lived on to tell thier brave story.
