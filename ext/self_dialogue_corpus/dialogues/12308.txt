Did you ever wonder where the Rancor came from?
What is the Rancor?
It's the big beast that Jabba the Hutt would feed prisoners to.
Oh yeah, the one that Luke finally kills when he closes the gate on it.
Yes, that's the one.
Yeah, that thing was pretty gross
So where do you think it came from?
Probably some obscure alien planet.
Yeah, maybe from the Dagoba system
Ha! Yeah, where Yoda lived.
