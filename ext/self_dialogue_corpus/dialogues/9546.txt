I think the most dreamy rapper ever was LL Cool J.
Yes oh my goodness!
Time has only made him even more good looking.
I totally agree. Which of his songs do you like the best from way back when?
I loved his song "Doin It". Talk about romantic and mood setting.
I really loved that song.
When did that song come out again?
I think it was around 1995 or 1996.
Yes that's right. I remember I was 9 when it came out so it was 1995.
Oh okay, that sounds about right.
