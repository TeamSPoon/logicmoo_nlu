Hulu has Little Shop of Horrors!
The 1986 one?
Yes, the great one.
I Love that. I'm going to watch that tonight.
I loved Rick Moranis in that movie. He is such an adorable little nerd.
He was super cute. I was happy he ended up with his love Audrey.
Ellen Greene was perfect for that role.
Yes she was.
How creepy is the Suppertime song?
As a kid I didn't think it was creepy, but as an adult it gets under your skin.
I had actually forgotten about Some Fun Now.
Yes we're having some fun now. NOW!
Amazing soundtrack!
Amazing, and highly memorable.
I know, I didn't realize how many of the songs I actually knew the words to.
Suddenly Seymour, is here to provide you Sweet understanding, Seymour's your friend
I thought it said Seymour's your man.
It says friend, then at the end is says man.
Oh right. Son... be a dentist.
You'll be a success.
