What would you say is the best live-action musical movie of all time?
Ahh, live action. So you're disqualifying all the Disney movies!
Yep, got to get rid of those. I know how much you like them.
OK, if you take those off the table, it's harder. Maybe the new Les Miserables?
You liked it that much, huh?
It was pretty good! I had only a few complaints.
Such as?
Well, the biggest one was casting Russell Crowe as Javert. Russell Crowe is a great actor, but the man can't sing well!
I remember that. His voice was distractingly weak.
I'm not saying every other character had the voice of an opera singer, but at least their voices were clearly above average.
Yeah, I'm kind of surprised you picked that movie, given that some of the musical numbers were a little shaky.
It definitely helps that I love the stories and songs to begin with, from the stage productions.
That's interesting, because it could go two ways. You could like it for that reason, or you could dislike the movie because it doesn't hold up to the previous stage productions.
In this case, I think the movie format brought a lot of good stuff to the table.
You mean, in terms of the costumes and sets?
Yeah, it was heightened realism vs. the play experience.
That makes sense.
Not to mention, singing aside, those were some mighty fine actors!
No argument, they were all top notch. I can't disagree too much with your pick.
But I'd still pick a bunch of Disney movies over it!
