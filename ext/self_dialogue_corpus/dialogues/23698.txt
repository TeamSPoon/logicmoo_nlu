Do you wanna go to the movies tonight?
Sure, what do you wanna see Baywatch?
Ugh, no, I heard that got terrible reviews.
But The Rock is in it.  I love The Rock.
Still no.  How about the new Pirates of the Caribbean movie.
I do like Johnny Depp. How was it rated?
Three and a half stars over all.  Its a good summer flick.
Are there tickets still available for it for tonight?
My AMC app says no.
Oh well, What about Wonder Woman.
Yes, lets see that.  It got great reviews too.
Yeah, everyone I know who have seen it loved it.  The fight scenes are supposed be epic.
Whats the name of the woman who plays wonder woman again?
Gal Gadot.
I saw in the news they aren't showing the movie in Lebenon because she served in the Isreal army.
Really.  Thats kinda sad cause its a great film.
Yeah it is, well, should I get tickets for us for tonight?
Definetly.  In fact, get four, I have two friends who wanted to go.
Cool, I'll get them for the 8:10 showing.
Perfect.  I'll buy the popcorn and drinks.
