So what is your favorite comedy movie?
Knocked Up
Oh my goodness I love that movie.
Katherine Heigl and Seth Rogen were great.
Yes they were.
I heard Katherine Heigl adopted after that movie. She didn't want to get pregnant.
Are you serious?
Yes I heard it on tv once.
That is hilarious.
Yes I know the movie spooked her that much.
