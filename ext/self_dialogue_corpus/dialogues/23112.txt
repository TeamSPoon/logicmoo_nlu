So I just got back from seeing that movie Logan.
Oh I still haven't seen it! How was it?
Well you know I'm a huge X-Men fan. This one had me almost in tears, it's kind of the end of an era.
You're right. Now they're doing all these prequels.
Yeah everyone is young again -- Scott, Jean Grey, Charles Xavier, Magneto.
While I'm happy about that, because I do really love James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender.
Me too. But I don't know, I'm kinda nostalgic for Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellan.
Well you just saw them in Logan! Well maybe not Ian McKellan, but he was in Days of Future Past.
Spoiler alert! I haven't watched that one!
I'm so sorry, well which ones have you watched so we can talk about it.
I saw X-Men: Apocalypse on my way home from London.
What? Apocalypse comes after Days of Future Past!
Well I didn't see it! I've seen all of them besides that one.
You must really be confused by the plot then. Do you know that X-Men, X2, and X-Men 3: The Last Stand didn't actually happen.
Excuse me, spoiler alert!!! What?
Yeah, because Logan went back to the past and changed everything. But it's okay because Magneto and Charles Xavier are friends again.
Really? I do remember in the early movies they would call each other 'old friend' and stuff like that.
Wait, did you see First Class? You see how they became friends in that one too.
Well I guess I haven't seen that one either.
.... we gotta do an X-Men movie marathon. Pop some popcorn, we're starting at X-Men.
