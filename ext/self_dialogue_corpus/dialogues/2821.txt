How have you been doing lately?
I am just keeping myself busy until football season rolls around.
Do you still follow the NFL?
I sure do! It is my favorite!
I remember when you were little you used to love the San Francisco 49ers.
I still do! They have always been my favorite team.
I can remember us watching that Superbowl they won together.
Me to, that is one of my fondest memories!
What year was that when they won the big game?
It was in 1995, that was the last year they won the Superbowl.
I thought they had won it a few years ago when John Harbaugh was the coach.
No, they got to the Superbowl but lost to the Baltimore Ravens.
That sure was a great team they had back in 95, huh?
I think it is one of the best teams of all time; even though most people underrate them quite a bit.
Was Joe Montana still the quarterback at that point in time?
No Steve Young was the quarterback for that particular team.
That is right, he turned out to be great in his own right however.
He sure did! He could hurt you with his arms and his legs.
Then of course you also had Jerry Rice on that team as well.
The best receiver to ever lace them up in my mind.
