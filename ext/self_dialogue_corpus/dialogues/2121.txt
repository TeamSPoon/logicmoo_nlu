Did you hear Gayle Sayers might have that Concussion Condition that football eventually get?
No I didn't hear that. That's sad.
Yeah it seems like more and more football players are being diagnosed and affected with it.
You know it should be expected that players eventually will have that condition.
Oh yeah? Why do you say that?
Football is a full contact sport.
But the players wear helmets and pads to protect themselves.
People wear condoms not to get a disease or to cause a pregnancy but it happens.
Is that the best analogy you got?
I'm just saying with all that tackling and head butting there's bound to be some consequences.
Yeah you right about that. But the pro-
The problem is the league should have and should now protect their players even more.
You're saying a football helmet is not enough to protect the players?
That's exactly what I'm saying!
So what should the football team owners do?
Past or present football team owners?
Both! They're both affected aren't they?
Yes they are. Very much so....
So what should they do?
Pay their past players what they're worth. Start by providing lifetime Health Insurance so those players affected with the condition can live a worthwhile productive life.
