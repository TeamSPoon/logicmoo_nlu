Hey what is your favorite football team?
The Giants!  How about you?
The colts!  How do you think Eli will do this year?
I think he will maybe win 8 or 9 games but won't go to the playoffs.
The colts will definitely win the division this year don't you think?
I'm not sure, he has been struggling in recent years.  Bring back Payton!
Do you think Eli is better than Payton?
The rings make them both equal, though Eli won his with one team.  I think Payton was overrated.
He certainly was successful with the Colts as far as winning divisions, but it only translated into one Super Bowl win.  What year did Eli win?
2007, right after Payton won his.  Have you ever been to a game?
I saw the Colts play the Patriots in Foxboro in 2010.  The Colts got plastered by like 30.  Have you?
I've never seen an NFL game.  Isn't it expensive?
I got my ticket through my work, and it cost me $300 for bus, tickets and food.
I can afford that!  How was the food?
It was great tailgating food.  I ate so much.  We had to bring our own alcohol though.
Of course.  Is your job running any more trips?
Not for the colts or the Giants.  Have you always been a Giants fan?
My whole life.  How long have you liked the Colts?
