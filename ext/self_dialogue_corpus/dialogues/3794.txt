Hey man, have you seen any good movies lately?
Hmm, it depends, what do you consider to be a good movie?
Well,I personally go for thriller types
Thriller types, huh? What's your favorite?
Well, there's always the classic "Psycho."
Oh man! What an oldie.
Haha, yeah. Hitchcock is timeless
What about a newer movie?
I think Inception is my favorite newer thriller.
Oh yeah, I saw that in theater.
