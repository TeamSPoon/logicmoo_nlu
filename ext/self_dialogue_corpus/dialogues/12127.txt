I was always a Luke and Leia shipper.
They're siblings. I don't think that would work out.
They weren't originally siblings.  In the draft script of Empire Strikes Back, Luke had a completely different sister.
It does come out of left field.
Exactly. The revelation makes little sense given what came before. It was just a neat way to end the love triangle.
It wasn't really necessary, though.  I mean, plenty of love triangles end without such revelations.
I think Lucas just wanted Luke to have a sister. I suspect the idea was that she could become a Jedi and appear in sequels.
If only he had done those sequels, instead of waiting so long.
I think a Lucas helmed sequel trilogy in the 90s would have been great.
It would have meant no prequels, though.
