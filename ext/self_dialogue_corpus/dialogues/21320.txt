Yeah, definitely.
You can't be serious.
I'm totally serious!
How could you possibly think that it's a better film than Pulp Fiction?
I don't know, I just liked the characters and lot a lot more.
What did you like about the plot?
Well, I guess the setting just worked for me.
What, because it's like a Western?
Yeah, that's probably it. And there was a much better plot.
No way!
Yes way. I thought that the story was more cohesive.
That's not true whatsoever. Pulp Fiction's story and dialogue is legendary
It's just okay.
What? Just okay? Pulp Fiction is infinitely better than Hateful 8.
Well why do you say that?
For starters, the scenery and story are more interesting.
What parts are you talking about?
Like, the "Say what again!" scene. That's a classic! There's no "classic" scenes to be found in Hateful 8.
Yeah, I guess we have to disagree to disagree.
I guess.
