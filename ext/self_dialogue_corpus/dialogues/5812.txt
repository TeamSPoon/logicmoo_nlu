Have you seen the new Beauty and the Beast?
Yeah! I watched it in theaters when it came out.
Oh really? How was it?
I liked it a lot. I don't really remember the original, though, so I couldn't compare.
Yeah, I haven't seen the original in years. I still want to watch it, though.
We could watch it together when it comes out on DVD!
Okay! Sounds like a plan.
We should watch the original first!
Oh yeah. That is a really good idea.
Sweet. I will see if I have it tucked away somewhere.
