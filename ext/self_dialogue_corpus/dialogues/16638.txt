What are some of your favorite soundtracks?
Oh I have a bunch. I'd say Garden State is my favorite.
I didn't really care for that movie.
I didn't either, but the soundtrack is superb.
What kind of music is on there?
It's very relaxing. Nothing too loud.
Any artists I would know?
Coldplay, iron and Wine, and Paul Simon you would definitely know.
Oh yeah I like all of them.
And really, every song is great from beginning to end.
I will have to check it out.
I used to fall asleep to it every night. It is so calming.
Sounds like something I can use. Any favorites?
I really like them all, but Blues Eyes is really good and Such Great Heights.
I think I will purchase it for download today.
You won't regret it. I could listen to it nonstop even the artists I'm not familiar with.
Thanks, I'm looking forward to hearing it.
Great! Let Go by Frou Frou is another great one.
I haven't heard of them either. I'm excited to hear some new bands.
Let me know how you like it!
