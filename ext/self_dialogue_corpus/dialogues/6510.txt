What were your favorite Disney movies of 2016?
I really liked Finding Dory and Zootopia.
Why those two?
Well I loved Finding Nemo so I had to see Finding Dory. Zootopia was just awesome?
Do you recommend Zootopia for my family movie night?
Yes. Its great for all ages.
Awesome, I will rent a copy for my family movie night.
I think your kids will be pleased.
I hope so, in the past I've failed to show a good film.
You can never go wrong with Disney!
