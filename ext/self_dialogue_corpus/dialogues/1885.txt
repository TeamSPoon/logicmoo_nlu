Hey, are you looking forward to the NFL season!
Absolutely! Let's see if the Pats can repeat.
I don't think they can. My money's on the Bucs this year.
The Bucs!?
Yeah, the Bucs, I think Mike Evans is going to have a big year.
Yeah, plus they picked up Desean Jackson.
See, They've got a lot of talent!
At receiver maybe...
And quarterback.. Winston is coming into his own
Yeah, but he's not even in the top five quarterbacks in the NFL.
Who's better besides Brady?
Well, Rogers, Matt Ryan, Big Ben, Russel Wilson, just to name a few.
I take issue with Matt Ryan.
Why's that?
The Bucs usually beat the Falcons.
That's true, I think they beat them twice last year.
Who do you think will win it all this year?
I don't know, maybe the Steelers.
Why the Steelers?
I think Rothlesburger wants to retire and go out on a bang.
