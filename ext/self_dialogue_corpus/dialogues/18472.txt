What music do you listen to when you exercise?
Oh, there are many tunes in my jazzersize arsenal!
Like what?
Well, I like to begin my exercise time with slow, gentle warm-up music, like a piano or guitar soloist playing elevator music.
Isn't it amazing how elevator music has changed over the years?
How so?
Well, when we were young, elevator music was this boring, ancient tunes with a nerve-deadening tempo and complete lack of energy.
The girl from Iwojima?
Yeah, something like that. Or maybe some Back concherto in E minor.
Yawn!
That's right. Made your blood pressure drop 10 points.
Like that hilarious scene from the movie, "Mr. and Mrs. Smith"!
Right! But now, more often than not, I find myself swaying to the elevator music.
Rocking?
Almost dancing! And one time I found myself singing to myself...
Well, that's not so bad!
Oh, yeah? How would you feel if you were doing the "Copacabana," complete with full body cha cha footsteps and head movements to the beat.
SOunds like fun.
Yeah, but you did not totally embarrass yourself in front of the building receptionist. Soon everyone in the building will know.
It could have been worse. You could have been wearing a feather boa.
