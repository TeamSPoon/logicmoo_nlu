Are your kids still into Frozen?
Well, they are starting to get out of it.
Mine still watch it everyday.
Wow, that's crazy.  I'm sorry to hear that.
Yeah, my brain is about to burst.
Mine would too.  I don't want to hear any of those songs as it is.
Yeah, hopefully it slacks off.
Well, all that's gonna happen is something new is going to come along.
You are probably right.
Yeah, we are stuck.
