Did you ever watch the movie Criminal?
I don't think so. Who is in it?
Kevin Costner and Ryan Reynolds.
Well that's a weird combination in a movie.
Well Reynolds sort of gets killed in the beginning.
Thanks for ruining that for me.
It won't ruin it. You still see him, and you don't know the story line.
Is Costner a policeman?
No. He's actually the criminal.
That's odd. He is usually the good guy in movies.
Yes, he is. He does have his moments in this one though.
Is it a good action movie?
Definitely. Good story line to it.
Any other good actors?
Yes. I'm not good remembering names.
Was it a long movie?
Actually, I don't know. Keeps your attention though.
So I should watch it? Did you rent it?
We watched it either on HBO or Netflix.
Okay. I'll look for it.
