So why did Harry break the Elder Wand?
I don't think he wanted the responsibility of it.
I took it as he didn't want anyone to have responsibility for it.
By tossing it off the bridge, he thought he could the trouble.
I guess it did work out, right?  I mean he did have a family
You mean the scene at the end at the train station?
Yeah, seems like his son was scared to go off alone.
I'm sure it was scary.  I really liked what Harry said to him though.
Makes you wonder if they'll make a movie about him.
I would pay to see it!
