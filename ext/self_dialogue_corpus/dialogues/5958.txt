What do you think about Disney incorporating songs into their movies again?
I think it is a great marketing strategy to interest old and new generations.
I agree!
With Frozen it has been very effective.
Frozen was all I heard about for months.
They are coming out with a second one too.
I know! I'm looking forward to it.
That's what is amazing about those movies. Adults love them too.
I guess that's the magic of Disney.
Very true.
