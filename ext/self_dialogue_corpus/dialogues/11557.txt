Hey, what's your favorite Beatles song?
Probably "I wanna hold your hand". Why you ask?
I dunno just because. I really don't see why they are so popular.
Yeah, I know what you mean. Maybe must because they we're like the first rock band.
That could be true.
You know what, I really don't hear anyone talk much about the Beatles anymore.
I rarely see them on t.v nowadays.
It would be so cool if they made a comeback.
Yeah, they should come out and make some new songs.
That would be awesome. We all need some new good, songs.
