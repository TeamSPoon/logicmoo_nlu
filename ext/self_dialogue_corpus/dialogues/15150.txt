Do you like the Beatles?
Yeah, I love them!
Cool. Which album is your favorite?
I really like Sgt. Pepper.
Oh, that's interesting! So you like their more experimental work?
Yes, I think they really started to experiment with Revolver, and it just kept getting better from there.
My favorite album is the White Album.
That's a really beautiful album. So you tend to like their later stuff?
I like all of it, even their earlier sappy stuff that got them famous.
That's funny, I don't really like anything before Rubber Soul. I guess I don't like the poppy love songs.
Yeah I get that. They're just so melodic, it's hard not to sing along to them.
So have you listened to all the Anthologies?
Yes, I really like the 2nd Anthology. How about you?
I have, but not closely. What did you lie about the 2nd one?
Just hearing them experiment and say funny things.
Yeah and they have some good alternative versions, if I recall.
Yes. And some funny ones.
Could I borrow some of them from you? I'd like to listen to them.
Yeah, of course! I'll send you all three of them.
Cool, thanks! Looking forward to discussing the 2nd one with you after I listen to it.
