What's your favorite song from Sgt. Pepper?
I'm not really familiar with that album. What's its most popular song?
Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds.
Oh yeah! I know that one. Elton John did a good cover a that song.
Well I prefer the original version better, but Elton's version is pretty good too.
I heard that the album was re-released recently.
Yes. It's a 2 CD version of the album; one of the CDs has alternate versions of the songs.
Are you going to buy it?
I'm not sure; I'd like to listen to a few of the alternate takes first and then decide whether to buy it or not.
That's a good idea, because the CDs are probably over twenty dollars.
