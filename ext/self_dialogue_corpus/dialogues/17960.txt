What's the best band you've ever seen live?
You know, I've seen a bunch of bands, but CKY is up there for me. I don't think they're even around anymore.
Oh, really? I wouldn't have expected that.
Me, either. I only know a few of their songs going in but had to buy a bunch of their albums afterwards.
Was it intense? Were there moshpits?
Oh yeah. The main thing was that their guitar tone sounded so incredible in person.
What was it like?
It was almost metallic. I'm not sure how to describe it other than gritty and dynamic but in control.
Not too many bands have mastered their own sound. I mean, Chevelle could be one, I guess.
Not too many bands sound like Motorhead.
That's for sure. That's a difference from a lot of the pop punk stuff.
Yeah, it seems like a lot of those bands have been forgotten.
Some of the big bands are so recognizable from that era, like Blink182 and Simple Plan, but not too many stood out.
A lot of those musicians went on to do other stuff. It didn't seem to last.
So out of the CKY albums, which is your favorite?
I just prefer the early stuff. It was unrefined.
It feels like a lot of artists nail an album out of the gate like they've been waiting their entire lives to get the chance to record it.
Yeah, I think it's that way for a lot of things. You've been waiting your whole life to throw down that first idea that's hung around your head.
Do you know why CKY broke up?
There were disagreements. I think the frontman left because he didn't like the culture of the group.
