Which Beatle is your favorite?
John Lennon.
Why is John Lennon your favorite?
The songs he wrote while in the Beatles are some of my favorites. I also think his music after the Beatles was better than the other Beatles music after they broke up.
What is your favorite John Lennon song?
Jealous Guy
What is your favorite Beatles album and why?
The White Album because it has such an eclectic mix of music not really arranged as an album. Most albums from that time period had songs that belonged together.
Do you think Yoko really broke up the band?
Yes and no. I think the band was ready to break up. We all know that Yoko had influence over John who was really the one who wanted to end the Beatles, not Paul as reported.
