There is this really cool horror movie from the '80s called Ghost Story that I'd think you'd like.
What's the plot?
These elderly man killed a young women when they were young men, and the her ghost comes back to kill them.
Oh, that's an interesting storyline.
This actress named Alice Krige plays the woman they killed.  She's super creepy.
Is this movie based on a book?
Yes, it is, as a matter of fact.
Who else is in the film.
Fred Astaire and John Houseman are two of the old men.  Craig Wasson has a part as a young instructor at a college.
It sounds like an eclectic cast.
