I hate Star Wars.
Why? What's wrong with it.
I just don't think it's a good show. It's too childish.
Well, lots of kids grew up with Star Wars in the 80's and 90's.
Don't you think the plots are too basic?
Star Wars was one of the first shows to do good vs. evil. It's a classic
Classically bad.
Well don't discount other people's tastes. Don't go to the dark side.
The dark side. Really? Do I get to use the force in the dark side.
Not if I use the force on you first.
