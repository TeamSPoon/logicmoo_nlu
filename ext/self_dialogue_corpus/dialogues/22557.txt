You know what movie was really sad?
I'm sure a lot of movies but which one do you mean?
I mean the movie Marley and Me.
The one about that dog right?
Yes, it was based on a book.
I remember that now. It came out when my son was a little baby.
Did you like it?
I loved it, very good movie but sad.
Yes I agree. I loved Jennifer Aniston's character.
She was an amazing mom in that movie.
I was afraid at one point they may get rid of Marley. Thankfully they didn't.
I know, such a sweet and loyal dog.
I just have a softness for animal movies.
I really do too.
What kills me is when she died at the end of the movie.
I know, I wish dogs lived longer.
If they could live as long as people that would be great.
I know, like tortoises who seem to live long.
It just seems sadder when an animal dies.
Yes! Even more so than a human.
