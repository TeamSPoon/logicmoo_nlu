What do you think of 'Brave'?
Are you kidding? It's my favorite movie!
Really?
Yea, I love how Merida is strong and doesn't marry anyone in the end.
Yea, that's cool. It teaches girls that they don't have to fall in love so quickly.
Yup and she looks pretty awesome.
Yea, I think the animators actually studied celtic paintings and animated her based on that.
Sweet, loving the historical element!
Yea, that's why I like the movie so much. I love celtic art.
Same!
