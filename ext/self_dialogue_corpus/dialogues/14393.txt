What do you see the Raptors doing next year?
I don't know. I feel this organization is at a crossroads
Yeah they have to figure out if the Lowry Demarr Derozan tandem is going to work going forward
I just feel like they can't get any further with this tandem
It may be time to move on from it
Yeah, but I think the organization is going to try and build from this
They picked up Serge Ibaka at the trading deadline and he played pretty well for them
That he did but he isn't enough to get over the hump in the East
Exactly. This team needs 3 point shooting badly
They definitely do. They also seemed to be weak mentally
Yeah Lowry seems to fall apart in the big moments. I don't trust this team
Neither do I. They just seem to shrink against the big teams.
Especially Cleveland. They always wet the bed against them.
The pacers gave the Cavs more of a challenge then the Raptors did.
I know that is embarrassing. That's why I would seriously consider changing the course of this team.
I agree, but I do't think the organization has the stones to do it.
They will just keep treading water. Happy with a 2nd round exit.
That's why some organizations never really prosper
Yeah they like to play it safe and that is not going to get it done
Yep they will stay in the middle of the pack
