Tell me what do you make of the Texans this year?
I think they have a decent shot actually.
Yeah, I was thinking the same thing
They have a pretty easy schedule
Yeah? I haven't looked.
Its not to bad. They just have to finish out games strong
Well the D is solid at least.
I agree. Watt is just a beast!
I wonder if they can keep it all going still.
I think so.
If they get some offensive consistency then I think they will be fine
For sure. They have the players I think.
Its just going to be close games down to the wire.
I have to admit I love a strong D.
Yeah, but its bad for the bloood pressure
Sadly you are right.
I think overall though they have a good shot
True. They just have to be consistent
And keep their heads in the game
Yeah...fingers crossed
