Do you like any songs by Guns and Roses?
I used to love them back in the day. I love Axl Rose.
What's your favorite song by them?
Oh definitely November Rain. That buildup to the instrumental at the end and the end itself was flawless.
The video was really awesome too.
I can still see Slash standing in front of the church playing the guitar.
He was actually named at one point the greatest voice of all time.
Really? I don't know if I agree with that but he did have a phenomenal voice.
I wonder what he's doing today. I wonder if he's still rocking out somewhere.
I don't know but I'd love to see a Guns and Roses reunion show.
