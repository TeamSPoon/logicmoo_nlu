What is your favorite group?
I've been a fan of Pentaonix lately
Oh yeah, I thought your favorite was Awolnation.
Yeah my favorite song from them is Sail.
I think that song was in that viral hit with the guy with the wingsuit.
Yeah that's the one.
What about Pentaonix; what is your favorite song?
I like their covers of Daft Punk songs.
Aren't they like a acapella group?
Yeah there's five of them and they all sing different notes.
They got pretty popular on youtube.
I think they are one of the most subscribed music artists.
I also like Snow Patrol.
Oh yeah, how come?
I like their relaxing songs and voices.

Chasing Cars.
My favorite is Chocolate.
Oh yeah that's a good song too.
