What are some of your favorite bands that have slid into obscurity?
Well, I think Linkin Park would be one.
Oh yes, thats a good one.
They used to be huge but now you never hear of them.
I wonder what happened to them?
Well, they are actually still around and making music.
Are they really? It seems like its been forever since I have even heard that name.
Linkin Park is even #1 on the top 100 billboard artists right now.
No kidding? I had no idea.
What about you? Whats a band that used to be huge but you don't really hear of now?
Well, I think Hinder comes to mind.
For sure, Hinder sky rocketed to fame a decade back but it seems like they just disappeared afterwards.
Right? When was the last time they released an album?
I think they released one in 2016 but that was right after their lead singer left the band and they got a new one. I couldn't tell you what it was called.
So they have a new singer? Wow. Thats probably why they aren't as popular anymore.
I agree, their lead singer's vocal quality was the reason they were so good.
Yes, indeed. He had such a unique voice.
I remember seeing them in concert in 2006.
That's cool, were they any good live?
Oh yea, they were fantastic. That concert was worth every penny.
