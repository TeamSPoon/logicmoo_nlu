What do you think of Carrie Underwood?
I really love her! I don't think I've ever heard a song that I don't like.
It's kind of crazy that she got her start on American Idol.
I know. I still remember her audition.
Do you know what she sang.
Yes, I Can't Make You Love Me by Bonnie Raitt.
Wow. You really do like her.
I do. I thought her first single, Inside Your Heaven, was beautiful and it just got better.
How many albums does she have now?
She has had five since she won American Idol in 2005.
Wow. That is really impressive. Do you have a favorite?
That's hard to say. I lover her first, Some Hearts, but I also really like Blown Away.
She is like a pop/country/rock crossover.
Yes that is kind of true. Although she sticks closer to her country roots for the most part.
What do you think of her new song with Keith Urban.
Well, I like it, but I hate that it is considered to be country.
Yeah, it really isn't country at all.
I hope this doesn't signal a change for her music going forward.
It would definitely be a big loss to country music if she went to pop instead.
Just like Taylor Swift did!
