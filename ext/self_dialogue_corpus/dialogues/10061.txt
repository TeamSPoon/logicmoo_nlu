DId you see any Charles Bronson Movies?
Sure, all the "Death Wish" series.  Each time his wife, girlfriend or daughter was murdered and he wreaked venvence on the killers in the end.
He started out as a pacifist in the first one and his wife and daughter were killed or maimed horribly by street punks.
The first time he struck back he used two rolls of quarters in a sock as a weapon to run off a would be mugger.
That was just practice as he was looking for the creeps that had destroyed his family.
He took out quite a few bad guys along the way.
Sure, there was a couple being mugged in a parking garage and he showed up to help, killing the bad guys.
The civilians suddenly could not remember what he looked like when the cops tried to find out who he was.
In the end the cops found out who he was but he had taken out so many bad guys that the let him go by making him leave town for good.
That put him in another city to do the same thing again a few years later.  It was risky to be his wife or girlfriend, most of them were murdered by creeps!
