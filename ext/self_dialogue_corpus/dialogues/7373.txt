There are some days when I feel like Tarzan.
Great film but what do you mean.
You know sometimes you find yourself in a jungle in just a loincloth.
What with a beautiful lady named Jane, a pack of gorillas and Phil Collins singing love songs.
Ha ha, yeah something like that. It is such a good film though.
Yeah, I heard they were making a sequel.
No way, when's it out.
Not too sure, just saw some rumours on the internet.
I hope they make a sequel.
If they do, you'd be ready made to play the elephant. Ha ha.
