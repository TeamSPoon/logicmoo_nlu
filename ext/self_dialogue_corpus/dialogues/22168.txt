Have you seen the new movie Everything, Everything?
No, I never heard of it.
I didn't go yet, I am reading the book.
What kind of movie is it?
Well, I guess I'll say a love story.
Not a big fan.
Me either, but I will say having seen The Fault in our Stars, I was surprised I liked that.
What is this movie about.
A girl who has a disease and can not leave her house or it will be fatal to her, my daughter went to see it.
Let me guess she does leave the house.
I haven't gotten that far in the book, but I know she's willing to risk everything for her love.
Did your daughter say it was good?
Yes and says there is a twist.
Let me guess she doesn't die.
Well I didn't get the whole story from her but No she doesn't.
It has to have a happy ending.
I guess I'll find out. I asked her if it was like Bubble Boy.
Now that was a funny movie.
Yes it was, very good.
A good comedy, that's what I like.
