Hi, have you ever listened to or heard of the music group called Enigma?
I can't say I have.
Well, I like them alot
Tell me about them.
Oh, they are great. They have been around a long time.
Really? How long have they been around?
Goodness, I started listening to them back in 1990. Not sure if they have been around longer then that.
I'm surprised that I've never heard of them.
Yeah, me too.
What genre are they?
They are a mixture of new age, ambient and electronica.
What are some of their songs called?
My favorite is their song called Sadeness. I think it was one of those songs that were one hit wonders.
I'm going to have to check them out on spotify later. They sound interesting.
I think you should. That would be awesome.
Where does the band hail from?
I believe they are from Germany.
You said you had their first record? What is it called?
It's Formation and MCMXC a.D. its the one that has my favorite Sadeness song on their. But they have so many great ones that you would have a lot to choose from.
Thanks for the new music idea. I will check them out as soon as possible!
