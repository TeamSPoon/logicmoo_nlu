Are there any comedy movies with Jack Black that not many people know about?
Yes, Orange County is one you might like.
That sounds cool. Is Jack Black in it a lot?
He is not the main character, but he is a huge part of the movie.
Cool, I will check that one out.
He is also in The Cable Guy. But, his part is small.
I would like to see that since I want to see his early work too.
Orange County is very funny though. You will like it.
I hope so. What is it about?
A guy who gets rejected to a school and then he tries his best to get in, with Jack Black's help.
