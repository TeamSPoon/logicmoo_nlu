Everyone knows that "The Empire Strikes Back" was the best "Star Wars" movie.
I disagree with that. It was the best.
What? You think the new movie was better than "Empire"?
Yes, I do. Absolutely.
You're nuts. They killed Han Solo.
Yes, they did. Which is, honestly, part of the reason I like it.
You like that they killed Han Solo?
Rules of the universe. Doesn't how far away you go, or how long ago it was. Everyone gets old. Everyone dies.
Not in the movies.
Yes, even in the movies.
