Hey,I'm playing a show tonight with my band, you should come.
I didn't even know you played an instrument.
Yes, I've been playing piano for a couple years now.
What kind of music does your band play?
We're a progressive rock band. Somewhere in between Pink Floyd and the Red Hot Chili Peppers.
Awesome! I love those bands. Do you guys do covers or originals?
Our singer loves doing Beatles tunes and psychedelic rock. Some jazzy stuff too.
Really? I didn't realize jazz and progressive rock went together.
Well, our drummers really talented. He was a jazz percussionist for a long time before he joined the band we're all in now.
Nice, I really like jazz. I feel like it's not as popular in contemporary bands today.
Yeah,  but it does have a strong following when you find that niche.
Do you guys play anything else?
Yeah, we mess with HipHop grooves too. It's some pretty funky stuff.
Does your singer also rap?
Yes he does. I actually prefer it, I think he sounds like ScHoolboy Q. What kind of music do you listen to?
Well, lately I've been listening to a lot of old music from the 90's.
What are your favorite 90's artists?
It's a lot of Spice Girls, Mariah Carey some Aaliyah. I liked the women of the 90's/millenium.
I have to admit Britney Spears is one of my guilty pleasures.
I think that's great.
