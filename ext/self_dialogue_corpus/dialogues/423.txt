Hey there, are you going to watch any NFL games this season?
Yeah, I'll probably tune into a few.
Oh, cool man. What's your favorite team?
I like the Falcons.
Oh yeah? Are you from the Atlanta area?
Yeah I grew up there, but now I live in Detroit.
Oh, so do you like the Lions too? They had a decent season last year.
Yeah I root for them too, I like Matt Stafford.
Yeah he's a pretty good quarterback. Who are some of your other favorite players?
I like Matt Ryan, and Julio Jones. What about you?
Yeah I like those guys too. But my favorite player is probably Marshawn Lynch.
Beast Mode. Yeah you must be excited that he came out of retirement to play this season.
Oh for sure man. It will be weird seeing him playing for the Raiders though.
Yeah, that's his hometown though right? Oakland?
Yeah I think that's why he came out of retirement, to play for his home team.
Oh, thats cool, we will see how the Raiders do this year.
I don't know if they will do that well. They are in a tough division.
Yeah the Chiefs, and Broncos and who else are in that division?
The Chargers.
Oh yeah that's right. They didn't do too well last year.
