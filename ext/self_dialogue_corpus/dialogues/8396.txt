What did you think of Lorde's new album?
Melodrama? I thought it was really good.
So did I. It's amazing how she managed to improve upon Pure Heroine.
I'm not sure it's as good as Pure Heroine, but it's still really good.
Most important is that she managed to challenge herself.
I think so, too. She really manages to go above and beyond.
She's one of the few pop stars to really play with the genre.
I think Lorde and HAIM do that the best.
I can see that. They both work on their craft.
They both definitely prove there's more to pop music than what you hear on Top 40.
