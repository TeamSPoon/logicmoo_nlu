Have you ever seen Teacher Fight?
No, but I heard of it. What's it about?
Well two teachers get into it over something really trivial, and one challenges the other to a fight.
Sounds pretty straight forward, who are the actors?
Charlie Day and Ice Cube. It's funny because Charlie is scared and tries to get out of it the entire movie.
What does he do to get out of it?
Well it all started because Charlie ratted out Ice Cube about something that happened to a student, the teacher threatened to fire them both, so charlie told the truth.
That doesn't seem fair.
Oh, it's not, but Ice Cube had his reasons.
So what does Charlie do to escape the fight?
He tries a few things. He tries bribing a student into saying nothing happened, he calls the police, and he even tries to frame Ice cube by planting drugs in his class.
I'm guessing each of these things ends up making things worse.
Kind of, there are a couple of times where Ice cube admits that he changed his mind, but then because of the new things Charlie did, it's back on.
So what does Charlie do?
Well, he ends up growing a lot through the movie. He realizes he's been pushed around for too long, and it's finally time for him to stand up.
Does he? Or does something stop the fight.
No, he really does. He shows up, and puts up a really good fight.
How?
Well, he's just determined that's all. He gets beat up pretty bad, but he never gives up.
This movie sounds hilariously bad.
