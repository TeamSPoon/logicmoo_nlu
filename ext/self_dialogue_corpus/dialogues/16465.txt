What was your first concert ever?
Hmm, I didn't go to many concerts growing up. You?
I went to a Backstreet Boys concert to make my high school ex happy.
Haha, how torturous was that?
You have no idea. It was insane.
Do girls at concerts really scream when a guy takes off his shirt?
YUP, and they get mad if we do it if a woman takes hers off. Very hypocritical.
I remember now: Rusted Root. It was crazy.
Aren't they a hippie band?
Yeah, my brother told my mom that I'd come home smelling like pot but that doesn't mean I smoked.
Wow, really?
Yup, it was in a really tight enclosed space, too. The guards were handing out joints!
That's. Insane.
I'm surprised the cops didn't break the door down and arrest everyone.
Did you at least have fun?
Yes and no. I was with a girl I liked but I hated dancing and I'm really boring.
You're SUPER boring.
Thanks.
At least I danced with girls.
Don't be mean! You went to a more open space for your concert.
