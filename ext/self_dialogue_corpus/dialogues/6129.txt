Have you seen the new Beauty and the Beast.
Not yet, what did you think?
Personally, I liked the old one, the animated one, better.
Really? Doesn't Emma Watson play the live version Belle?
Yeah, I don't know. I didn't feel the same magic.
Well what was different about it?
I'm just used to the animation like I said, also the music sounded completely different.
Well I know Emma Watson sang in the movie as Belle.
Yeah, I just don't think she's that good to be honest.
Well luckily we can always watch the animated version.
