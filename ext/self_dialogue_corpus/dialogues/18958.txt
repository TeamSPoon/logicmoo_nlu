Did you hear that the melody of Shape of You and No Scrubs is the same?
What? No way!
Yep. Ed Sheeran included the writers of No Scrubs on his song because the melody totally matches.
Wow. Who were the writers he included?
It was Tiny and Kandi Burruss.
That's so crazy. I had no idea they wrote No Scrubs.
I didn't know either until recently. No Scrubs was such a great song by TLC.
It definitely was. Weren't Tiny and Kandi in a group together called Xscape?
That's right. They're on a reunion tour right now.
It's always so nice to see groups reunite. I loved Xscape's song Who Can I Run To.
Me too. Ever since I heard they were on a reunion tour, I've been listening to all their music.
What other songs of theirs do you like?
I like Just Kickin' It, Understanding, and Tonight.
Those were some of their greatest hits.
I wish there were more girl groups out right now.
Me too. The only one that comes to mind is Fifth Harmony.
I love their song Worth It.
I love that song too, but it's the only song of theirs that I know.
You know what? That's the only one I know, too!
I'm going to have to check out some more of their music because I'm sure they're very talented.
