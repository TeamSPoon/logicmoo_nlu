Do you listen to AFI?
Sometimes.  I've heard some of their more recent stuff.
You should check out their older music.  It's really great.
What albums do you recommend?
The Art of Drowning and Black Sails in the Sunset.
What kind of music is it?
Melodic punk, kind of.  They've really changed their sound over the years.
How so?
Well they started off as a straight punk band and made their way all the way to electronic music.
Wow, I had no idea they were a punk band.
Yeah, you'd really have no idea, looking at them now.  I mean, five years ago Davey Havok was wearing blue eyeshadow and fake lashes.
Yeah, he's an interesting guy, that's for sure.
He evolves with his music.  He looked totally different when they first started versus The Art of Drowning versus Sing the Sorrow versus DecemberUnderground.
Yeah, they sound like a really progressive band, on many levels.
They are.  But their best music was definitely during the Black Sails/Art of Drowning days.  I highly recommend it.
I'm not too into punk music, do you think I'll like it?
Well, it's MUCH more melodic than regular punk.  I'm not such a fan of pure punk myself.
Okay, well I'll give it a shot.
Definitely.  If you don't like it, try Sing the Sorrow.  It's much more pop-ish.
Okay, I will.  Thanks!
