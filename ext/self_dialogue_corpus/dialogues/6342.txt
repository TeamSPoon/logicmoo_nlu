Did you see the Beauty and the Beast film with Emma Watson?
Yes, I saw it in theaters. It's out on DVD now.
I don't think Emma Watson was the best actress to play Belle.
She was a bit meek in the role, but it is a hard role to fill.
Dan Stevens was phenomenal as the beast. Great actor.
I agree. He did a great job with the role, even though he was a computer graphic character for most of the movie.
Most of the film had to be. I guess that is the hardest part about making an animated movie live-action.
With all the talking objects like Cogsworth and Mrs. Potts, it is a wonder they even attempted to film it. Technology today made it possible.
I wonder what Disney movie they will attempt to film next.
I hope they film Sleeping Beauty. That film is one of my favorites.
