Did you ever get to watch Lego Movie.
Yeah. I took my boy to see it when it came out.
Awesome show.
I went just for my kid, but ended up really enjoying it.
Me too! I thought it'd be a lot of CGI.
It was!
Huh? It looks like stop motion.
I thought so too. There must have been some though.
I'll have to watch it again.
I've seen it about 3 time myself.
