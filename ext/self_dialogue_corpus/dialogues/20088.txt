What movie are you most looking forward to this year?
Probably Spiderman.
Thats like the 8th time theyve done it.
Yeah but I think this one is going to stick.
Why do you say that?
Its in the MCU so those movies normally can attach themselves
I agree with you, they do a good job.
Plus we sort of got introduced to him in the last Avengers.
Yeah its going to be interesting to see him in a kids point of view.
Well he does still fight villains.
Who is supposed to be this one?
Vulture I believe.
Any idea on the actor playing the role?
Oh its going to be Michael Keaton.
Wow! They always get star power.
Who wouldnt want to be in them? They are money makers!
Well I hope Robert Downey Jr keeps playing Ironman.
Oh he will, probably stops at Infinity Wars.
And then does what?
Retires and enjoys his money.
