I've been on a Beatles kick lately.
They are iconic!
I've been listening to them all day.
What do you think about John and Yoko Ono?
I actually liked them together!
Wow. Really?
I know everyone hated them together but I thought they were really in love and it was inspiring.
I think she broke the Beatles up! Anyways, what song are you listening to?
I'm listening to I Wanna Hold Your Hand!
I love that one!
