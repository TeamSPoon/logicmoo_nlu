Did you see The Fate of the Furious?
Is that the newest Fast and the Furious movie?
Yea, it was pretty great, one of my favorites.
I have not seen any of those movies since the third one.
Really?  Since Tokyo Drift?
You picked the worst time to stop, it got way better after that.
I thought it got pretty silly so I couldn't get myself to keep watching them.
The newer ones are pretty much action movies, less about racing.
That is interesting, all I remember were the racing scenes.
You should give them a shot.
