Hi! Are you excited for the next Green Bay Packers season??
You know it! I can't wait! Do you have access to your dad's season tickets again this year?
I do, are you interested in going to a game!
I definitely would be. I can't wait to see what Rodgers can do this season. How do you think the season will start?
Hopefully we get 'em right out of the gate & it's not like last season. What game would you be interested in going to?
I'd love to see the Packers play the Vikings - what a rivalry! Do you think I can get tickets to that game?
I'll check and see. You like a good rivalry, maybe you'd want to see the Packers and Bears play -- would that be okay for a backup game?
For sure! That'd be cool. Do you think that's the better battle?
Yeah, I'd pick a game between the Packers and Bears any time - but maybe it's because I'm from Chicago. Where are you from again?
I grew up in Minneapolis! I am a Packer fan and got a lot of heck for it as a kid growing up in Minnesota.
I bet you did! That must have been tough. What was the worse thing someone said to you?
Actually, people have always been really nice. Do you go around talking smack to someone wearing something other than a Packers' jersey?
Well, no... but my mom went to a game once at Lambeau with her Bears shirt on and people were really rude to her.
In Lambeau? They have some of the most welcoming fans in the league!
I know, I was surprised too. She probably won't be going back there again.
Good news for me, so that I can get a chance at another set of tickets. :)
Definitely. If you got them, who would you take with you?
You, friend! That'd be so fun.
I don't want to go, bring someone else.
That'd be fine too.
