Who do you think is one of the most underrated MCs of all time?
Jeru The Damaja.
Who's Jeru the Damaja?
He's a New York rapper known for his albums The Sun Rises in the East and Wrath of the Math.
So which one should I listen to first.
Either will do, I prefer The Sun Rises in the East.
What is his style?
If you're familiar with and enjoy early 90s New York hip hop, you'll really like this. Think Nas.
Ah, that sounds so great. Nas is one of my favorites.
Same. Jeru the Damaja also has DJ Premier as a producer, who is just the best.
