What movies are you looking forward to this summer?
I don't know, I don't watch many movies.
Have you seen any movies recently?
I did see Wonder Woman.
I did too!
What did you think?
I really liked it! I watched it with my best girl friends, and we all felt so happy at the end. How about you?
I saw it with my boyfriend. I liked it too.
Did he like it?
He didn't like it that much, but I did.
Why didn't he like it?
He thought that there wasn't enough action.
That's crazy, there was tons of action!
I agree!
What kinds of movies does he normally like?
Superhero movies like Wonder Woman, which is why it was strange that he didn't like it.
Well, he's silly.
I agree.
Want to see it again? I'm up for it.
Sounds good.
