What artists do you think have the best lyrics to their music
That really is a good question, almost too many artists to name
Well which ones come to your mind right away?
Whitney Houston's music had very expressive lyrics
What song is that?
The one called 'One Moment In Time' was lovely. It was meant to inspire the athletes in the 1988 olympics
Yep. I love the lyrics to that one
What about you, what music is expressive to you?
A song from that band called Journey 'I'll Be Alright'.
That one is great. That guitar solo at the end-- pure genius !
Its seems like that one is very healing.
I know what you mean, its like the lyrics really say whats on your mind
You mean like after you  breakup or something
Yeah, that, or even like after someone dies or something
Yeah Steve Perry keeps saying I'll be alright without you
It really touches your heart
I think thats what all artists really want essentially
Well Journey certainly achieved that with this particular music
Well the next time I experience a death in the family or heartbreak ... something like that
Sorry to interrupt. You know what to listen to.
