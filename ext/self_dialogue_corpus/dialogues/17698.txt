Who names a band "Rainbow Kitten Suprise?" What a strange name!
I know, I know. Odd, isn't it? But their music is fantastic.
I'm not sure I buy it. What do you like about them?
They're super chill, but piercing at the same time. It's like a dream that stays with you.
Does it remind you of rainbows? Or kittens?
Rainbows, maybe. Kittens, no.
Alright then, what songs do you recommend?
I can't stop listening to "Devil Like Me." But "All That and More (Sailboat)" is another favorite.
Where are they from?
The band met at Appalachian State University in Boone, NC. They started in a college dormroom!
So, like your typical dorm room guitars?
Maybe they started that way, but they're defintiely not like that now. They just played at Bonnaroo!
When was Bonnaroo? This month, right?
Yep, earlier June!
Where else are they playing this summer? Maybe we could catch a show.
Hmm, it looks like they'll be at House of Blues in St. Louis on July 5!
That could work. What do you think?
It's an awesome venue. I say let's do it! But first you have to stop laughing at the name.
I think they want you to laugh at the name! It's too silly for anyone to take seriously.
I'll give you that. Like really, "Rainbow Kitten Surprise"?
