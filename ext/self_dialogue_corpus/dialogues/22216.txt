So did you like the first Reacher movie?
I absolutely hated it. I almost walked out.
I hated it too. Why didn't you like it?
Well, for one thing, Jack Reacher is supposed to be--
Tall! Huge! Gigantic! Tom Cruise is--
Short. Undersized. Not--
Not tall. At all.
And then, Cruise can't act, either.
Oh, yes he can. Magnolia. Risky Business. Jerry Maguire. Interview with the Vampire.
Okay, yes, he can act. But in this one, he didn't.
Yeah, you're right. I wonder why not.
Maybe he knew it was hopeless.
Yeah, maybe. A bad script, a bad physical fit, maybe he gave up before he started.
Or maybe he just doesn't want to be an actor any more.
Yeah. Maybe, in his mind, he's retired.
Or maybe he had huge, distracting, personal troubles.
Or maybe he was sick.
Well, it doesn't matter. They're making another one anyway.
Oh, no.
Because he's such a star he doesn't even have to act.
