What rock bands do you listen to?
I like the classic rock, like Aerosmith and Van Halen.
I love Aerosmith, Steve Perry can sing.
Yes he can. What is your favorite song?
Theres alot of them, but I'll say Toys in the Attic.
I like the song Tell me what it takes.
What about Van Halen?
I like when David Lee Roth sang with the band better. How about you?
I like Sammy Hagar, but I think Roth is cuter.
I went to a couple Van Halen concerts in the 80's.
