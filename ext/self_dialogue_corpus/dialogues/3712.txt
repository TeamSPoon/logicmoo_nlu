Have you seen any Hitchcock thriller movies?
You mean like Rear Window.
Yes that is the one I was thinking of.
Yes I love them I think I've seen a few.
Oh what other ones have you seen?
Psycho of course.
Oh yes that one has such a classic shower scene.
It still freaks me out to take a shower alone after seeing that.
Yes same here and Rear Window always makes me suspecisions of my neighbors
Yes I love how they have it set up where he is stuck in his chair because he broke his leg.
