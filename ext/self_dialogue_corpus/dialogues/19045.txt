Do you like Drop Kick Murphies?
Yeah, they're ok.  I'm not a huge hard rock fan but I'll listen.
I'm the same way.  But these guys are awesome in concert.
Really?  How so?
They are just all over the place, very crowd friendly.
That's pretty cool.q
They also make the concert feel intimate.  They talk to the crowd a lot and are really down to earth and play hard.
Sounds awesome.
The only thing is they like to give smaller bands a try, at least that's what I heard.
So no mega concert I guess.
No not really, when I went they were awesome but everyone else was just meh.
That's too bad.
Not really, shows you that you can come in last minute.  Oh I almost forgot, I had floor seats!
How did you get those?!
A girl had them and took me on a date.
Man you're lucky.
Yeah, it was what I called the most Boston weekend of my life.
How is that?
I went to a Drop Kick Murphies concert on St. Paddy's day weekend on a warm day after a snow storm and before another snow storm at Boston Univeristy.
Yes, that would qualify as an extremely Boston weekend.
