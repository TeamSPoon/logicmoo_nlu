Do you like Pop Music?
Not today's pop .
I like Michael Jackson  and the Jackson Five kind of pop.
Today's pop  music seems brainless to me. No one stands out anymore.
I agree. I refuse to even listen to current radio.
Me either. I don't even know very many popular stars or their music if I hear it
Well you aren't missing anything.
How do these people get popular? They vocals are so doctored that a lot of them really stink under normal circumstances.
It's called brainwashing.
And lipsynching helps! Wake up people!
