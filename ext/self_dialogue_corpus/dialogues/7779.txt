What's your favorite class in the Harry Potter movies?
Mine is divination, what's yours?
Potions. I love cooking and chemistry sets so that would be right up my alley.
Yeah if you didn't turn yourself into a frog first.
That's why paying attention is so important. I'd have loved all the classes to be truthful.
Same here. I love the way they make you familiar with the inner workings of the school throughout the series.
Yes I believe that's part of its appeal. I want to visit the Harry Potter world at Universal Studios.
Oh me too, I've been wanting to go since before they opened.
I heard they really stuck to the movie, and included all the little details in the movie that fans would love.
We'll get there one day, in the meantime we can continue to watch Harry Potter marathons for now.
