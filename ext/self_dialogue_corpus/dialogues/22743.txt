I saw you rented a movie from the library, what did you get?
I got the film 1776; I watch it every Fourth of July.
Oh, is it a Revolutionary War movie?
It's a musical about signing the Declaration of Independence.
That sounds interesting. Is it a recent film?
No, it came out back in 1972.
Are there any actors I'd know in it?
William Daniels is in it.
Who is that?
He played Mr. Feeny on Boy Meets World.
Oh, I didn't know he could sing.
Yes, he plays John Adams.
It sounds like it's probably not very historically accurate.
Well they probably weren't singing all the time, but in one duet, many of the lyrics come from actual correspondence of John and Abigail Adams.
Oh, that's very interesting.
Yeah, It's a pretty good musical.
Well I might give it a try sometime. Did it win any awards?
It was nominated for a Golden Globe.
Well, enjoy watching it.
Thanks, I will!
