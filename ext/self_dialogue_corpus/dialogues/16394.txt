What is your favortie genre of music?
I like music from the late 60s early 70s
I do too, but I also like the 90s, early rap, alternative and grunge
Some of that is pretty good too...Nirvana and Pearl Jam
Yes, I love them and also some lesser known bands like Marcy Grey
I've heard of them I think, can you name a song?
I like Sex and Candy
Oh, I remember that one!  But I love THe Who, The Beatles, The Stones
Yes, the old classics are great
Too bad music today is so corporate
I know what you mean, it really sucks
Yep, all innovation seems to be gone
It seems to be pretty boring to me
It's been a long time since I've bought a new cd
Me too
What was the last CD you bought?
Well, I think it was Amy Winehouse
She was good...too bad she ODed
Yep, that was sad.
I was really looking forward to her appearance on SNL and she got sick and was a no show
