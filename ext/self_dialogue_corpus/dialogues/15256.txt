Do you like Beyonce?
Not really. I am not a big fan of Beyonce.
Are you kidding? I thought everybody liked Beyonce.
Many people do, but I am not a fan.
Why not?
I don't like her voice very much.
I can't believe that. I love her voice! It is incredible.
I know she has a great range, but I just do not like the tone.
Have you heard her album Lemonade?
I have not. What is it about?
It is about a lot of things. Parts of it are very serious and about race relations.
Interesting. I did not know she had music about that topic.
She does! It is very important to her.
Maybe I will give her another chance. I love music about that topic.
That album even won some Grammy awards.
That is amazing. I didn't know much about that record at all.
It sold a large amount of copies and was rated as one of the best releases of the year.
I will definitely check it out then and give it a listen.
It is one of my favorite albums of the last few years.
Thank you for sharing all of this info about Beyonce. You might have changed my mind about her.
