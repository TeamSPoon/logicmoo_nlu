Dude Lebron James is the best player of all time.
No way, I think that is Michael Jordan.
Why?
Well, he is a great baller.
How come?
He can dunk.
But so can Lebron.
Well that doesn't matter.
Why not?
Because dunking is not everything.
Ok, well Lebron has a jump shot.
But so does Jordan.
But Lebron has years to play.
That is right, Jordan is done.
Well, do you still like Jordan?
Yes, he can dunk from the free throw line.
That is true but so can Lebron.
That is right, maybe I like him now.
Ok, I am glad I convinced you.
Thanks I love baseketball.
