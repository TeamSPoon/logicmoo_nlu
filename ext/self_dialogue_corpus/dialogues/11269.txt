So, I read that bell bottom jeans are coming back in style. What do you think about it?
I'm not sure I would wear them, but seems like everything that has gone out of style eventually come back.
I think I would wear them, or at least try some on. I like that whole hippie, bohemian look.
I've noticed neon colors are coming back as well.
I won't wear neon, it's just too bright. I have seen some really pretty choker necklaces though.
I would totally wear those, I've seen them too in so many different styles and colors.
Have you seen Betsy Johnson's new line?
No,not yet, looks like I will have to google it and take a look.
She's got so many cute shirts, purses and pajamas.
That she does. Seems like I can't get enough of her stuff.
I love her stuff too, not many people like her stuff though.
Everyone's tastes in clothing, etc is different.
Guess that's what makes us unique then.
I suppose so.
Another brand I like is the Lucky brand, I love the jewelry and clothes.
Me too, it's just so hard to find at a decent price.
Well, you know we both have excellent taste, although it may be a tad to expensive for our small salaries.
Yes, I know.
All this talk about clothing has made me want to go shopping. You want to go see if T.J. Maxx has any new Betsy Johnson stuff in ?
Sure, let's go check it out.
