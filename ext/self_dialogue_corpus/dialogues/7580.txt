How many Harry Potter movies are there?
It depends on how you count them, though eight is probably the answer.
Weren't there seven books?
There were, but the last book, "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows" was divided in to two parts.
Were the same actors used throughout the movies?
Mostly they were, but there were a few exceptions.  Dumbledore and one of Draco's henchmen changed.
Why did they change?
The role of Dumbledore was played by both Richard Harris and Michael Gambon due to death.
Anyone else change?
Lavender Brown did, she was only a minor character in the first couple, so it wasn't that important in the first couple because she didn't really have speaking roles, but when the later books came out and she became more important they changed her actress for the later movies.
