So, what bands do you like in this day and age?
That's a huge question. I like so many.
Okay, what genre do you like?
that's a better question. I think my favorite at this time is Country music.
Country music is alright.
Yeah, I go through lots of phases when it comes to music.
What band do you like the best when it comes to country. Name just one.
Hmm, If I have to name one, then I would have to say George Strait.
Ah, he has been around for a long time.
I'm glad you heard of him.
Of course I have. He was the first country singer I liked.
Which song was it that made you like him?
Dang, that is a lot of songs I have to list off.
List of a couple and I'll tell you which of them I like as well.
Well. I love his songs called Fool Hearted Memory, Baby's Gotten Good at Good-bye and The Cowboy Rides Away.
Those are amazing songs, I agree with your taste.
Now how about youâ€”which ones do you like?
Okay, definitely the ones you named off and Sea shores of Old Mexico, Love without end and Amarillo By Morning.
Yup, those are great as well.
i know right. But I think we can both agree pretty much everything he ever made was amazing.
