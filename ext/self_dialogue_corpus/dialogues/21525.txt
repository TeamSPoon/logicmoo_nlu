Have you seen any good movies in the past few months?
Not really. How about you?
Nothing new. I'm more into silent films.
Have you ever been to that old theater downtown? They play them sometimes.
I go whenever they're showing something good!
I can't say I've ever seen a silent film before.
Well you like Star Wars right? And Blade Runner?
Two of my all-time favorites, yes!
Well then you should check out Metropolis.
I've never heard of that. What is it?
It's a 1926 sci-fi film. The first sci-fi film!
You know that's my favorite genre.
Yeah, and it was the first of its kind. It was done by Fritz Lang.
Who is Fritz Lang?
He was a director in Germany. One of the greatest.
Better than Steven Spielberg?
They're definitely on the same level, although I prefer Lang's stuff.
Well I guess, if you prefer the classics!
The classics force you to pay attention to the plot!
But they also put me to sleep!
