Do you remember the scene in the Sorcerer's Stone when Harry puts on the sorting hat?
Yeah! He almost gets sorted into Slytherin right?
Yeah! But then the hat decides to put him in Gryffindor.
Just like his parents James and Lilly!
What house do you think you'd be sorted into?
I think I would be Ravenclaw because I love to read. How about you?
Slytherin I think because I'm not nice enough to be a Gryffindor.
Really? I think you'd be a Hufflepuff like Cedric Diggory.
Maybe! What does it mean to be a Hufflepuff?
It means you are a loyal friend!
