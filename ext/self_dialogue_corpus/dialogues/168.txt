Have you checked out any superhero movies recently?
Yes, I recently watched Wonder Wall in theaters!
So did I, I thought it was one of the best movies this year!
Wow, really? I thought it was great too. What was your favorite scene?
My favorite was hands down the no man's land scene.
That was a great scene, the CGI was amazing and she looked so badass.
I know! Another favorite was the first scene when the amazon's were fighting the Germans on the beach.
That was such an unexpected scene! It was just upsetting when Diana's aunt was killed.
I know, I was so upset that we lost such a great character early on.
Hopefully, we will learn more from her if there are any sequels.
