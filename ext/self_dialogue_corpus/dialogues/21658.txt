What is the best romance movie you have ever seen?
I would have to go with Titanic.
The one with Kate Winslet?
Yes, and the boat.
They all die right?
No, she lives but he does not.
I seen it.
What did you think of it?
I think it was dumb that he died, like he could have fit on that board.
I know, they both could have lived.
I liked Billy Zane in that movie.
He was the sort of bad guy.
Well, him and iceberg really.
I was so mad he lived in the end.
Yes, but Rose pretended like she died,
And got away from him, forever.
What did you think of the ending?
When old lady Rose throws the diamond in the water?
Yes, that made no sense.
Millions, just wasted
