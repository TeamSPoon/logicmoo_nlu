I rewatched The Little Mermaid over the weekend.
How was it.
Good, actually, I wasn't sure it would hold up over time.
Why is that?
Some movies from oru childhood loose their touch as we get old, this was still really good.
Did you like anything more then when you were a kid.
I found i liked the music more, maybe I understood the lyrics better.
I could see that.  The music for that movie was really good.
It was, and I liked Sabastion even more, he was really funny.
Yeah, when he's trapped in the kitchen with the chef cooking all the seafood, thats a great scene.
