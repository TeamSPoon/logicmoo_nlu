Have you ever tried listening to Big Band music?
I don't know much about it.
You know at least one song.
Which song is that?
Sing Sing Sing.
How would I know that song?
It was in the movie Tower of Tower.
Oh now I know. Who was it by?
Benny Goodwin. He's also had some other really huge Big Band hits.
Like what?
I think you know the song In The Mood.
I didn't know that was Big Band. I really like that song.
Me, too. Another Big Band favorite of mine is Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy.
The song by Bette Midler?
Actually, it was originally done by a group called The Andrew Sisters.
Looks like Big Band music had a lot of upbeat songs.
It did and apparently it was easy to dance to.
What kind of dancing did people do?
It was called swing.
That's news to me.
