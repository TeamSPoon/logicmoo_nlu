Dude, tell me you saw Wonder Woman.
Not yet.
All I can say is this: Wow.  Gal Gadot knocked it out of the park.
That's my dream girl right there!
It wasn't just that she looked great.  The movie had a great plot and superb directing.
Yeah, a female director actually made it which I found kind of cool
I think it will be cool if they make a sequel to it.
I know she's in the next Justice League movie.
Who needs all the guys!  Just give me some Gal!
I'm with you there!
