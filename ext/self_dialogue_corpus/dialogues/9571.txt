don't you agree that hip hop music is the most popular music played at bars, next to dance music
that's kinda true, depends on where you are, at college town, hip hop is probably the most popular type of music
who do you like the most?
It's really hard to decide, I have multiple in mind that don't really differentiate from each other
well, who are they exactly?
Young Thug, Drake, G-Eazy ,etc.
good choices, I like their music a lot too, in fact I was just listening to Pick Up The Phone by Young Thug
really?
yeah, those song are very warm and energetic, unlike jazz, which is warm as well, but jazz is usually too chill
yea, jazz almost make me sleep
