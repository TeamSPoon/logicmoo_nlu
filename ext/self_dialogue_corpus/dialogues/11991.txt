I just saw Return of the Jedi.
That's my favorite!  I loved the Ewoks.
Yes, they were super cute.
What was your favorite scene?
I loved it when Leia kills Jabba the Hut.
Carrie Fisher looked great then.
I also liked the ending, with the fight against the Emperor.
Yes, that was pretty cool.
I wasn't pleased that they removed Ray Milland at the end.
I didn't know that.
