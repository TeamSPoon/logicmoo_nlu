moana is a great movie.
i agree! it has great music and even the rock as a voice actor!
i love the art style.
yes, the visuals are indeed great!
its too bad that the movie didnt go too in depth.
yea. i would have loved to see a tiny maui as well
me too, and also the gods that raised him.
yea, that would have been amazing.
watching him learn to use his hook would have been so cool.
and also watching how the gods made the hook, and the proccesses it took to do it!
