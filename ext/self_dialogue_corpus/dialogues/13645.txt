Do you like Star Wars movies
Not really, I'm more of a Star Trek fan
Really? Almost everyone likes Star Wars
Nah, I thought it was too corny for my tastes
Are you crazy? They have great story lines and characters.
Really? Like Jar Jar Binks.
Well he was the exception
And ewoks?
Hey, they were great characters and cute.
Yeah, right. I beg to differ.
