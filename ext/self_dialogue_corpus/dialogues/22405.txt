So I guess drew Barrymore was quite a partier
Yeah she started drinking at a young age
Being an actor has its ups and downs
Being in the public is a tough thing
Look at brad Pitt for instance
Yeah his divorce to Angelina Julie is pretty ugly
I agree. It's so sad
Another famous actress who gets in trouble
Lindsay lohan
Kind of surprises me. She was so west in parent trap
That's another great film
I love the part when they are camping
Another Lindsay Lohan movies I liked was mean girls
I know I know a chick flick
I didn't like it so much. Too high school
I just like howshe was able to go from being a zero to popular
What's your ultimate scary movie
I would have to say my ultimate scary movie is paranormal activity
Yeah I thought it was real
The acting in the series is quite ssinister
