is it just me or some of the Avengers not really that good of superheroes.
Explain what you mean.
Take Hawkeye.  No special powers, just really good with a bow.
Why's that a problem?
Because in the real world, he would have been killed long ago in battle.
Yeah, but that's why it's called a movie.  You have to suspend belief.
Same thing with Black Widow.  Secret agent doesn't mean you're invincible.
But it would be boring if they weren't mortal.  They could always be killed off.
Maybe they will be in the next movie.  Got to do something to keep the series interesting.
They won't be missed even if they did.
