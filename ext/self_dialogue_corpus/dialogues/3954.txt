I saw a really good thriller movie today, it was called "Dark waters".
Was it a good movie?
Yes it was good, it was about a woman being trap at sea.
I saw a similar movie called The Shallows" , it was a pretty good movie.
There is a thriller movie called"Krampus", that suppose to be a good.
I saw that movie, I did not like it very much.
Did you see the movie called" Dead Story" about these kids at this secluded house?
Yes!  I saw that movie, it was scary but a little phony.
The movie" The Forest" was not that great either.
I like most thriller movies even old 1960 classics.
