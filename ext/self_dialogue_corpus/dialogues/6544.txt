I love Disney movies so much!
Me too.
They make me feel like I'm a kid again.
They make me really happy too! My favorite is Lady and the Tramp.
Aw! That one is so cute! I haven't seen that one in a long time. Lady is so beautiful.
I love the spaghetti eating scene!
I  just think talking animals are adorable.
That's true.
I also love Snow White because of Snow White's singing voice. It's so cute!
I agree.
