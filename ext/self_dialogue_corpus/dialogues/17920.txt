What was your favorite concert?
A couple years ago I went to Boston Calling?
Oh? And how was that?
It was great.  The Pixies headlined.
Oh man I heard the shred like crazy.
Yeah they do.  Jack Black was there too.
Yeah I heard they're pretty awesome too.
Yeah, and of course they say some funny stuff.
Yeah?  Like what?
He has someone take his shirt off in between songs.
That's odd.
Yeah it was, but funny.
Who else was there?
Vance Joy was.
Yeah how were they?
Just Ok.  I mean I liked them but I didn't even realize who it was until they played RIp Tide.
That's kind of funny.
Yeah, I don't know many other of their songs.
Me either.
It was still an awesome concert though.
