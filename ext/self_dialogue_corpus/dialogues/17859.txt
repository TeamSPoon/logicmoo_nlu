I just learned some stuff about the Beatles.
Like what?
Well, that they are actually a folk band.
No way, they are pop.
No, they were popular, but actually a folk band.
I guess I like folk music.
I love folk.
What are some good bands?
I would say Bon Iver is on of the best.
What does he sing?
He had an album called "For Emma, Forever Ago".
What was on it?
I thought Skinny Love was the best.
Are there any other you would say are like the Beatles.
No on is like the Beatles.
Who would you recommend?
You might like Simon and Garfunkiel.
I like that one song they did, with the music video with Chevy Chase.
The Call me Betty one.
I think it is still so funny.
