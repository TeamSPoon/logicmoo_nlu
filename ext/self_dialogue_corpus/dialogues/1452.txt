Hey man, you thinking of attending any NFL games this season?
Yeah! I was thinking of going to a Rams vs. Seahawks game. You know those always end up pretty good.
How do you think Goff will do with a new head coach?
He should do pretty good this season! Mcvay is said to be an offensive guru.
True, i mean look at the Redskins in the past seasons, he made kirk cousins looks like an all star.
How about you? Thinking of flying out to NY to catch a giants game this season?
Yeah, i want to. Eli is getting older and i want to catch him which hes still doing well.
You think they can win the division this season?
Yeah, I think Dak and Zeke will his a sophmore slump, Redskins lost their offensive mind to your Rams, and Phily is a joke.
Haha, we will see. I can see Dak taking a step back now that teams have studied him some, but not Zeke.
We will see. Dallas DOES have a pretty good line, any half decent back can get a 1000 yard season runnning behind them.
Speaking of good lines, Lynch to Oakland might be pretty good to watch.
Yeah, that should be pretty fun to watch. Oakland has probably the best line in the league right now.
Plus, you have a well rested beast of a running back playing for his hometown. Talk about motivation.
Seriously. You think they'll win it all before they move to Las Vegas?
They might. They have one of the best offenses in the league right now, and they have the defensive MVP mack so they might.
Man, that MVP was robbed from Von Miller.
Well, you know how the league works, I think that Miller was slightly better but Mack got it because of the team records.
Probably true, but Oakland looks lethal and could win it all next season.
Yeah, they finally got some playoff experience last season, and i hope they lose again in their first round this season.
