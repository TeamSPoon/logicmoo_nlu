Whats the scariest movie you have seen recently?
Well, I would have to say The Conjuring.
I have heard of that, whats it about?
Its about a family that moves into a house controlled by a demonic witch.
Wow, sounds pretty scary.
Yeah, and they claim its based on a true story too!
Dang, that just makes it even more spooky.
I don't really believe that its based on a true story though.
Why is that?
I have heard people say they visited the actual house and nothing happened, and people currently live there.
