What are your thoughts on the live action Cinderella?
It was just ok.  The dress was nice.
I love the cartoon!
Oh, it's my favorite! Sing sweeet nightingale, sing sweet night -in - gale!!
It is my favorite version of Cinderella.
At least the new one had magic.
Unlike Ever After.
But, I still like the birds and the friendly mice in the cartoon.
I do too.  And the pumpkin tranformation.
Oh, the best!
