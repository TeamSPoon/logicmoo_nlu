I just saw Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows â€“ Part 1.
I didn't like them making two movies out of one book.
Yes, it's all about the money.
Any good scenes?
I like when they made six decoy Potters.
Cool.  What was the group Harry is up against?
The Horcruxes.
Right. Anybody get killed in this one?
Dobby.
Oh, no!
