Do you prefer the old Star Wars movies or the new ones
I like the old ones. I grew up with Luke, Hans and Leia.
One of my favorite scenes is when Hans cuts open that animal and stuffs Luke into it to keep them alive.
I thought that was gross.
I also thought it was funny when Leia kissed Luke for luck and Hans got all jealous
Yeah, but then you find out they are brother and sister
Yeah, what a twist. How about Darth Vader being their father
I know right! How messed up is that?
And then later in the series for Han and Leia's son to turn to the dark side
I know, and then he kills Han's!! I almost cried!
