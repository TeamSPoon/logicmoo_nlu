Oh my goodness, I just got tickets to the Eagles concert.
The Eagles? Who are they? I haven't heard of them.
Are you serious? The Eagles are a classic American rock band. They've been around since the 1970s.
Really? What songs do they sing?
Well, my favorites are Wasted Time and Take It To The Limit.
Oh, now I know who you are talking about. Didn't they recently lose a band member?
Yes, Glenn Frey died at age 67. He was a major part of the band. He wrote most of the music and also played guitar.
So how are they going to have a concert without him?
Well, I am not sure. I assume they are just going to try to go on without him.
Who are the other band members?
Don Henley, Bernie Leadon, and Randy Meisner are the other members.
I've heard of Don Henley. Didn't he have a successful solo career after The Eagles broke up?
Yes, he sang that one song from the movie Real Genius...All She Wants to Do Is Dance.
That was a great song. Didn't he also sing The End of Innocence?
Yes. See, I knew you have heard of this band before! They had 6 number one albums and a bunch of number one singles, too.
Yes, now that I think about it, I did like that song Heartache Tonight. That was their song, right?
Yes, that single was hot in 1979. It sold about a million copies!
OK, now I remember The Eagles. They do have some good songs.
Rolling Stones ranked their album Hotel California as one of the 500 greatest albums of all time. I think it was even at number 37!
Wow! I hope you have fun at your concert. Have an extra ticket?
