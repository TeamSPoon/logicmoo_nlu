Have you seen the real to life Beauty and the Beast with Emma Watson?
I haven't. I liked the classic one though.
I liked that one, but the real to life one is pretty awesome.
I will have to check it out. What Disney movies do you like?
My favorite of all time is The Lion King.
That's a great movie, I love the music.
Jonathan Taylor Thomas voiced Simba as a cub. He was a cute character.
He was. I thought the death scene of Mufasa was so sad though.
When he fell off the cliff? Yes, that was brutal to watch.
I love that he came alive again in the stars though, that was sweet.
