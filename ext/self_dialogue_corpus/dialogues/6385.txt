How many Alice and Wonderland films are there?
I'm not sure, I think there are a lot of them.
My daughter especially loves the 2010 film
Really, why do you say that?
She watches it weekly.
Wow, it loves like Disney has their hands full with your daughter!
Haha, I agree. Does your daughter have any favorite Disney films?
She likes 101 Dalmatians.
That is a classic.
Agreed!
