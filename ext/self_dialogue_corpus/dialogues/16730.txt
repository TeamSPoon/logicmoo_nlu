Hey, what did you do last weekend?
I went to go see a concert at The National.
Oh cool. Who did you see?
The Avett Brothers. It was a ton of fun!
I've never seen them live, but I really like their music. Were they good?
They're really good live! I definitely think you should go to their next concert.
Yeah, maybe. Do you know when they're coming back to The National?
I think they're playing again in July.
Okay yeah, I'll look into it! How much was your ticket?
I paid $60. It's kind of pricey but well worth it!
Maybe I can convince Brad to buy me a ticket for my birthday. He likes folk music.
Yeah, he would really like them! Especially because he plays the violin.
Oh yeah I forgot the have a violin player! What other instruments do they use?
Everything! Guitars, banjos, piano, cello, upright bass.
Wow! Sounds like a really good show!
It is! You and Brad are going to have a ton of fun!
I think so too. What's your favorite song by them?
Kick Drum Heart. It's really cool live.
I hope they play it!
You're going to love it if they do!
