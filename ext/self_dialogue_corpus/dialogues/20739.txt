What movies were never made that you wish were made?
I definitely wish they made a Chuck movie.
That was such a great TV show!
I know and there were even rumors about a movie.
I guess something prevented them from making it.
It definitely wasn't Zachary Levi. He really pushed for a movie and he would have been great in one!
The main reason I would have liked a movie is the show didn't really get justice in the finale.
I know that whole thing with Sarah losing her memory and then not exactly getting it back was a cliffhanger.
They kissed at the end but it's like does Sarah know who Chuck is yet?
It was a really strange and unnecessary cliffhanger.
At least if they made a movie they could have wrapped up this strange twist in the first 10 minutes.
Yeah then the rest of the movie could be crazy missions.
I would have loved to see more missions with Grimes!
Yes the movie would have been perfect for that!
He got to tag along with a few towards the end of the show but never really got a big role in the missions.
Imagine if Grimes saved the world in the movies.
That would be incredible.
This movie had so much potential it is a shame it will never be made.
Never say never but it is definitely unlikely.
Yeah if by some miracle the movie gets made I will watch it 100 times.
