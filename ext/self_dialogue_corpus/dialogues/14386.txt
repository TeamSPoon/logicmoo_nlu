Which teams do you think will meet in the Finals?
That is pretty obvious, considering how the playoffs are going.
You're right. So do you think the Cavaliers have a chance?
With the way Lebron is playing right now, I certainly believe they'll give the Warriors a good run.
Lebron looks amazing right now, but the Warriors seem unstoppable.
That's true. The Cavaliers barely edged out the Finals last year, and that was before the Warriors picked up Durant.
That is certainly a game changer.
Absolutely! The best team in the NBA last year acquiring one of today's greatest players has certainly elevated them to another level.
That makes four All-Stars in one team.
Well, the Cavaliers have three: Lebron, Kyrie and Kevin Love.
Let's be realistic. They are Eastern Conference All-Stars.
That is very true. There is a big competitive gap between teams from the Eastern Conference and teams from the Western Conference.
There is almost no comparison.
Yeah, the Cavaliers certainly had an easier road to the Finals than the Warriors.
That, however, gives the Warriors much more experience against high level competition.
That experience will certainly play a role.
I believe the Warriors will close it out in six games.
That is if they don't sweep the Cavaliers.
That's hard to imagine. The Warriors will almost surely take the crown, but Lebron and the Cavaliers are too competitive to lose four games straight.
That is true. They'll put up a good fight.
