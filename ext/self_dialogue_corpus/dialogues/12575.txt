How many more Star Wars movies do you think they will make?
Well, at least make a trilogy.
So two more?
I think they will of the actual story line after the next one.
Then what?
Maybe add more like back story movies, like the Solo one.
I hope they do not.
I do, people love Star Wars.
I love the feel of it, but not if it is too much. Too much of a good thing you know?
I would still like to see as many as they could put out.
