Have you ever seen any action movies from the 70s?
I saw The French Connection.
I think I've heard of it. Who is in that?
Gene Hackman stars and Roy Scheider costars.
Would you recommend it?
Absolutely. The chase scenes are very well done and the acting was top notch.
I've heard about the chase scene that's supposed to be one of the best ever.
Yeah, it is as good as they say in my opinion.
What did you think of Gene Hackman?
He was fantastic, as always.
