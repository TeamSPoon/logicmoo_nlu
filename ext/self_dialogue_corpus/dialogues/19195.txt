Did you ever see any classic rock bands live?
I saw Aerosmith. That is it
You are lucky
It was a lot of fun
What year was it?
1991
Were they really good?
Yes
I'm glad for you
Thanks. I had front row seats.
Cool
They are really good live
I bet
I think there are tons of good live bands
I agree. There are some bad ones too though
The classic rock bands were probably always good live
I agree.
I wish I could see Led Zeppelin live
I bet they are amazing
Yeah and Black Sabbath
