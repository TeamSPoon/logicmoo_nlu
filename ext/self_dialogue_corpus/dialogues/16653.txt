Have you been to any concerts lately?
No i dont get to go to many. You?
I saw kid Rock recently, he was awesome.
I bet, I would love to see him in concert.
We just had memphis in may by where I live, but there was really nobody good
That sucks, I bet it's awesome though
Yea, I only went once, it was pretty fun
I wish we had something like that by where I live
It sucks that it's always and may and almost always raining.
Yea I can imagine
And there's this other thing that country station has a free concert every week in the summertime.
That sounds great I love country music.
I saw Trent Tomlinson one time, I don't remember who else.
That sounds like a lot of fun
It is, you don't have anything like that?
No, I wish, I might suggest it now
Hopefully they do, it's great.
It sounds like it, I love all kinds of music
Me too
I need to go to more concerts
