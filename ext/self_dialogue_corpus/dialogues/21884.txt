What movie moment has stayed with you years later?
I find myself still upset thinking of the curb scene in american history x.
That was a difficult scene to watch.
You know what I find surprising about that film?
No ,what?
Tony Kaye wanted his name removed from this film.
The director? really?
ya, crazy right?
I thought it was a well done movie. Something to be proud of.
Apparently Norton locked himself away and edited it a bunch. Gave his roel more screen time too.
Interesting I never knew any of that at all.
What has stayed with you ?
Disturbing wise I would say Requiem for a dream. So much of that film, the party scene and speed sequence are glued in my mind.
That movie had so many unsettling scenes.
I recall after seeing it, just sitting on the couch in almost shock. Probably a good 10 minutes.
It was upsetting content. But very strong acting.
Ellen Bursten was incredible. Also jared leto and Wayans.
The whole cast really gave it there all .
Jennifer Conelley can not be forgotten.
It must have been a hard role to portray. Like what does that do to your mind?
