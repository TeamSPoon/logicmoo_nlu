Have you seen Bridget Jones' Baby?
Yeah, I watched it on Netflix.
Did you like it?
I honestly thought it was just ok. Bridget Jones' Diary was better.
I agree. I thought it was a bit contrived.
Though I didn't mind that Patrick Dempsey was in it! He's so hot!
You're funny... everyone I've talked to seem to be more into Colin Firth.
True. I still can't believe how different Rene Zellweger looks.
I know! She looks totally different. She was so pretty before she had all that surgery! What a waste!
She does look different, but I guess to each their own.
What did you think about Colin ending up being the dad instead of the other guy?
I figured. She needed a happy ending, but I guess the other guy stayed in their lives. That was a little weird.
Yeah, I thought so too. But it's a movie, so they have to write off all the storylines.
Unless they make another movie!
They better not! They'll ruin the whole thing for younger people. Bridget Jones' Diary is so under appreciated.
Yeah, leave it to Hollywood to ruin a good thing!
Are you surprised though? Every sequel is pretty bad. Except for Despicable Me 2. That's the best sequel ever!
I love that movie!
Me too. Let's hope they don't keep making Bridget Jones movies. Put the money into a new film!
I agree. Although, if they make another, I'd honestly probably go see it. I'm a sucker!
