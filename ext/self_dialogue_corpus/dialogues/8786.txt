Any good new bands out there?
I've been listening to a band called the I Don't Cares recently, they're pretty cool.
That's a good name, I've not heard of the.
It's actually a collaboration between Paul Westerberg and Juliana Hatfield.
I know who Juliana Hatfield is but I forgot who Paul Westerbeg was.
He was the lead singer and guitarist for The Replacements, then he made a few solo albums after that.
Oh Okay, I remember him. I really used to like his music but haven't heard any of his in several years.
He's still great. He's a very underrated songwriter I think.
What's the best song by The I don't Cares?
My personal favorite off of their album in a song titled King of America. It's really a good song, you should check it out.
