Hi, what do you think about the song called Yellow?
Do you mean the one by Cold Play?
Yep, that is the one.
Oh, nice one! I love them actually.
Me too but I don't really know a lot about them.
They are a British band who formed in the 80's.
Oh, okay I think I read that too.
The lead singer is Chris Martin and he used to be married to Gwyneth Paltrow.
That is crazy. I did not know that.
Do you have a favorite singer?
I really loved Prince, actually.
Oh yeah man, he was so great.
Will truely be missed for all songs and the vibe he contributed to music.
I heard that he has a vault of new music, that he left behind.
I heard that too!
I think they will be releasing them this year or early next year.
I wonder if he will have another hit like Purple Rain?
That is one of my favorite songs of all time, man.
Mine too. I was able to him live about five years ago.
That will be a show that you will never forget and that you were lucky to even see, awesome!
