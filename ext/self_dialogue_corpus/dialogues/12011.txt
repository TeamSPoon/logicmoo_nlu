Too many people don't understand the nature of the Force.
Right. Even Disney was buying into the Light vs Dark dichotomy.
A Manichean balance is tempting, because it feels intuitively right. You don't have to delve into the Buddhist philosophy that Lucas was getting into.
I'd still prefer it if Snoke didn't talk about the Light as if it were a thing. There's the Living Force and the Unifying Force, and there's the Dark Side, which is an imbalance between them.
Maybe if Lucas didn't call it a side people would understand better.
Possibly.   Did you see The Force Awakens yet?
I have. I consider it to be inferior to the Original Trilogy and the Prequels
That's harsh.
The prequels are unfairly maligned. The make more sense if you go back and look at them.
Jar Jar Binks will never make sense.
