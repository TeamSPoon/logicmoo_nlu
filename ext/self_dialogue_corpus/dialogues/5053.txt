Isn't baseball great?
Excuse me?
Oh, beg pardon, I was talking to my parrot.
That's weird. Your parrot a sports fan?
Thats none of your business.
My apologies. For what its worth, I like baseball!
Nobody asked you though.
Fair enough, I was just saying.
No, just ignore him. Two outs.
What was that?
Stop eavesdropping, I'm trying to have a conversation about baseball.
Does your parrot really understand english?
Clearly better than you do, did you hear when I told you to leave me alone?
Sorry, its just....a baseball loving talking parrot! Its fascinating.
Deal with it.
I can't, its rather remarkable really. Whats his name?
Babe Ruth.
Well ain't that something.
I'd say its a home run of a name.
I'd say you watch too much baseball.
