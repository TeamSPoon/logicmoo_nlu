Do you remember the New York Giants Super Bowl run?
Yes
Which one was your favorite?
The first one
That catch was amazing
my heart was pounding
Mine too
I did not think they would get the second one though
Me neither
They are only team that can beat the Patriots
Eli Manning is great in the clutch
I think Brady might be more clutch
Yeah, against everyone but the Giants
I hope they play again
Me too
Who do you think would win the third match?
Giants again
Really?
Yes
That is very possible
