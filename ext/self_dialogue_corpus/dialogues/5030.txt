Are you watching the Toronto Blue Jays and the Seattle Mariners right now?
Yeah, low scoring game, but Marcus Stroman is pitching strong
Sure is. Too bad he gave up that double to Ben Gamel in the 5th which scored a run.
I know! At least that only tied the game.
That's true, until Jarrod Dyson's singled to score Danny Valencia from 2nd base for Seattle
Hey...Still more innings to be played. We can come back
Woo!!! Home run from Kendrys Morales to tie it back up!
Yeah!!! That ball got out of here in a hurry!
Like you said, Still more innings to be played. Now it's a game again
Looks like they are pulling Stroman, and Jason Grilli is pitching now
Uh oh! Hope he doesn't let this one get away from him.
I know! he has been off and on all season so far.
And now he's given up a couple singles already.
But here comes Aaron Loup to hopefully get us out of this inning
He has been pitching well for Toronto this season.
And he strikes out Seagar!
Wow, they only put in Loup for one batter, now here comes Dominic Leone
And Leone gets them out of the inning
Let see if Toronto's Bullpen can keep this up
Right! We could really use another win right now.
