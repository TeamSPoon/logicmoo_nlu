Depends on what?
When I want music in the background when I' focusing on something else, I like to listen to classical music or piano versions of popular songs.
Interesting! Do you think that helps you focus more?
It really does!

Mozart if probably my favorite.

I find J-Pop really energizing when I don't have to concentrate quite as heavily.
That sound fun!
It really is.

Well, when I'm not worried about concentrating at all, there are a ton of different songs I enjoy. I really enjoy Broadway.
