Who is going to be the breakout star this year in the NFL
I think you need to look at the rookie class for the next breakout star.
There are a lot of awesome rookie running backs this year
My money is on Leonard Fournette. 6'1" 240 and one of the fastest guys in the league
He's like a freight train running down the field.
I see him as being the next Bo Jackson.
He could easily rush for 1,500 yards this year, or he could easily fall prey to numerous injuries like he did in college
He only struggled with a few in college. I believe he'll play at least 15 games and finished first in the league in rushing
How do you think Christian McCafferty will do this year?
Where was he picked?
The Panthers took him 8th overall.
He's quick and can do everything with the ball. I like his game, but I don't see him being as good as Fournette
He's a different type of back. I can see him catching 80 passes while rushing 12 times a game.
In today's game that's just as valuable as a guy who carries it 25 times a game.
I would put money he has more touchdowns than Fournette
No way. Fournette will get all the goal line touches because he's so big
But McCafferty is so crafty. I can see him scoring in so many different ways.
Either way, I bet neither of them is as good as Elliot this year
That's true, but only because Elliot has the superior offensive line.
Both Fournette and McCafferty have awful offensive lines in front of them.
