Had you ever seen the movie The Blues Brothers?
Of course! I come from Chicago.
Does everyone who lives in Chicago watch that movie?
Probably more people from Chicago do than elsewhere in the world. But it's a pretty popular movie.
The car chase in it was amazing.
Yeah, it was supposed to be the most elaborate car chase ever made for a while.
I'm sure some newer movie has topped it since then.
Yep, I'll bet the Fast and the Furious movies did.
I loved the music in Blues Brothers too.
Did you know that some of the actors in the movie are actually well known musicians.
No, I didn't know that!
Aretha Franklin sings a song in the movie.
Oh, I remember the scene that must be hers.
It's sad that John Belushi died. He was a funny comedian.
Yes, it's tragic that he died to young.
I think he lived a rough lifestyle. But yes, a tragedy.
We'll always have movies like Animal House and Blues Brothers to remember him by.
That's true. Both classic comedy movies.
Now I kind of want to watch Animal House.
Haha, enjoy it!
