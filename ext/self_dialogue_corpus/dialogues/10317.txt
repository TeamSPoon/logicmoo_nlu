What is a good action movie to watch?
We could watch Law Abiding Citizen.
Oh, I haven't seen that for a long time. Gerard Butler was fantastic in that!
He was. I definitely didn't expect it to be so dark.
Me either. Especially after seeing him play the good guy so much.
I know what you mean. He was a really good guy in Gamer.
Exactly. He went from misunderstood hero to crazy vigilante like it was nothing.
I was completely on the edge of my seat during Gamer.
Me too. Also, his role in 300, just amazing.
I know! He's such a great actor, he can really do anything.
