I have a new puppy!
You do? What kind?
It's a little girl. She's a teacup poodle!
Is that really a dog or is it a mouse?
Of course she's a dog!  She's so cute, and she reminds me of Taylor Swift!
The singer?
Yes!
Why?
She sings so well, and she looks good in a collar! I'm gonna name her Taylor.
Taylor....Ok.  I'vre heard worse names for a puppy.
My cute little Taylor!  The cutest puppy in the world!
I thought Taylor Swift was more of a cat person?
Yeah. THere's that YouTube video of her being smothered by her mother's big dog...she was traumatized and that's why she's a cate person!
I bet the Taylor haters out thee wish they were that dog...
Not funny!  Besides, I think Taylor Swift would love my little Taylor!
Why? Because your poodle weighs 12 grams?
No. Because my doggies loves to dance to Taylor's song, "Shake It Off!"
I can't.
Why not?
My puppy only dances when I put her in spandex.
