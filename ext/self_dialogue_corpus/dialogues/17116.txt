What kind of music are you in to?
Classic rock all the way.
How did you get in to that?
It has been on the radio at work everyday for the last 5 years.
I would think you'd get tired of it after that much.
Well it comes and goes with the days.
Have you tried listening to other stations?
Yeah, but there is always a customer complaint about whatever station we turn to.
Well don't people complain about the rock station?
That's the weird part, we've never gotten a complaint about it.
That doesn't seem possible.
I didn't think it would be, but we've tested the theory. We tried different stations and within an hour someone comes up to us to change it.
Well what kind of stations are you turning it too?
We've tried country, classical, even hit-pop; someone always complains immediately.
It's weird that one of the most controversial genres is the most accepted now.
I've developed a theory about that.
Oh and why do you think everyone is ok with it.
Well for too reasons, older customers feel nostalgia hearing music from their youth, Middle aged adults were the marketed group so they grew up on it, and anyone younger thinks it's vintage.
It is scary how much sense that makes.
No the scary part is, whatever store you go into is playing a similar station, and no one has claimed alien intervention or government conspiracy.
