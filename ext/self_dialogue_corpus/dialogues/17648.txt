Do you think country music has gotten better or worse over the years?
Honestly I don't think it has changed all that much.
You don't think the music has evolved in recent times?
It is really not much different from when I was a kid.
I think it has gotten so much better.
Don't get me wrong I love the music but essentially the message is the same.
True but at least the delivery has become more sophisticated.
I agree with that opinion. The sounds are more advance.
Yes less banjo more guitar, less violin more bass.
The bands themselves have gotten younger and bolder.
They certainly have and country music images have gotten more involved.
What do you mean?
When I was in Iraq Toby Keith, Carrie Underwood and Montgomery Gentry all visited.
You mean they went into a war zone to play for the troops?
Yes with the USO I think. I don't think any of the classic country stars would have done that, but I could be wrong.
Do you not like classic country mussic?
I dear me yes! I love the classic country singers like Dolly Parton, Kenny Rogers, Conway Twitty, and Loretta Lynn.
But you don't think the message has changed?
Not I don't because the Reba sings about heartbreak and loss just like Miranda Lambert or Shania Twain.
You might be right but I still love them all the same.
