I was so happy when Ludacris showed back up in the Fast5.
Tej is definitely welcome at my house anytime.
Well when he's gonna show up with nice cars, hot women, and gets you paid; why wouldn't he be?
I like him a lot better after he lost the afro and sweats though.
Agreed, it certainly upped his cool factor.
My favorite scene was in the 7th movie I think, when he was talking to Rome and Rome was telling him how rare his car was.
Then Tej walked outside and he had the same exact one.
Yes, I busted out laughing at that.
That was classic, but for me, his best scene was his first appearance. After the race when Brian gives him some of the winnings and he turns to show it off to the crowd.
And thus the legend was born.
