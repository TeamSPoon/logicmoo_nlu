So did I.
Are you going to see it?
I will when I find the time to.
I'll go with if that's ok.
Sure,I will let you know when.
There are a few others that I think are good as well.

I heard that John Wick was amazing.
We should see that one.
Yes we should.
Which one do you think we should see first.
I think John Wick would be better.
Why?

I haven't seen the first one.
You should.
