I didnt know, I think thats great I loved that little rascal.
Yeah I think its great as well.
Do you know when its coming out?
Im not sure but Ive heard is coming next year, I really want to see it.
Me too, I liked the old version very much.
Yeah it was pretty cool it was a great movie from my childhood.
Do you know who the villain is going to be?
Im not entirely sure but I know that Michael Keaton was cast for the role.
I think Disney is doing a great job reviving clasic movies.
