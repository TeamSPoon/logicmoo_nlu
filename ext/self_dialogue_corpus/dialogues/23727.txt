Have you seen the movie Roman Holiday?
With Audrey Hepburn?
Yeah. Have you seen it?
No I have not.
That is too bad.
I don't like old movies that much.
Really? Why is that?
Because they bore me a bit.
I understand that.
They are not as exciting as newer movies.
What movie is your favorite then?
I love Top Gun
Well that's also an old movie kind of.
Not as old as Roman holiday.
That is true.
I like it because Tom Cruise is a great actor.
I agree.
We should watch it together sometime.
Agreed. Well it was nice talking to you!
Same to you!
