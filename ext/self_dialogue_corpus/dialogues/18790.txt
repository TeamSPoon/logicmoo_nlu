Do you like any Boy Bands?
Are there any that are still relevant today?
One Direction is probably the most relevant.
Yeah I've heard of them but don't really enjoy their music.
One of their members quit as well so not all of them seem to be commited to writing great music.
If I am being completely honest I didn't completely hate the Backstreet Boys.
I loved the Backstreet Boys!
What is your favorite song by them?
I would have to say I Want It That Way was my favorite by them.
That is a great song! It is still popular today and has been remade so many times into various parodies.
Yes and every version is catchy mostly the original.
Don't tell anyone I like the Backstreet Boys.
Are you embarrassed about it?
Not exactly, I just don't think advertising that I like Boy Bands is the best idea.
I completely agree I'm not sure how girls would feel about it either.
Some would find us bold for liking Boy Bands others might find it weird.
Yeah imagine if we were just listening to Backstreet Boys sucking our thumbs and a bunch of girls walked in.
They would probably make fun of us for that for months.
If they would ever stop.
Maybe we shouldn't tell people we like the Backstreet Boys!
