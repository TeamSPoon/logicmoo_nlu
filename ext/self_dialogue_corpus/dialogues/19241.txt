Do you know who Avenged Sevenfold are?
I do. They're actually my favorite band ever.
Awesome! Which album of theirs is your favorite?
You might be surprised by what I say.
What is it? Sounding the Seventh Trumpet?
No. It's The Stage!
The new one? That really isn't a bad choice.
I love the direction they took with the album, making it a concept album and all.
They also really went full on progressive metal with it. I thought that was great.
That's the other thing that made me like it so much. After Hail to the King, I was worried they would start to sound stale.
Thankfully that's not the case, right?
Exactly. They haven't written an album that good in years if you ask me.
What's your favorite song off the album?
Exist, without question. That son's a masterpiece.
That one was a bit tough for me to get through because of how long it was.
That's unfortunate, because it really is a good song.
I really liked Creating God, myself.
That one's my second favorite. It's arguably the most accessible song on the album.
Accessible in that it's more likely to appeal to a wider audience?
That's right.
