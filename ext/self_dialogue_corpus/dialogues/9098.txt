Who is your favorite rock artist
I'm a big fan of KISS
Wow, thats very old school. Why do you like them
I was raised on their music through my dad, so it's all nostalgic to me. Plus they sound great
I've never really heard of their songs though
Are you a fan of hard rock
Yeah, I guess. Never get a chance to listen though
I recommend I was Made for Lovin' You. It's a classic
I'll have to listen then
It's one of their most famous songs
