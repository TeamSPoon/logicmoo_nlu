Hey! Doesn't the NFL pre-season start soon?
Kind of, right now its still training camp and the pre-season games won't start until September.
Gotcha. How are your Packers looking this year?
So far I like what I see at training camp, but we are still a long way from football season.
I don't know how I feel about the changes to the Redskins office, I feel like it can go either way at this point.
Yeah, I heard there were some big changes on the offensive line and the coaching staff.
Do you think any big name players might be playing their last season this year?
Maybe, Brees is getting old and so is Brady.
But Brady has been having some great seasons! He is ready for retirement.
True, but personally I'd rather quit while I'm ahead than stay in the game and go out with a loosing season.
Does this mean you think your Packers stand a chance against the Patriots this year?
Of course! But, I'm not so sure the Patriots will be up for a repeat performance of last year.
Are you going to get tickets to any games this year?
Maybe, they are really expensive and I'd have to travel a few hours.
Which ones are you looking at?
The Packers have a pre-season game in DC against the Redskins, and there is a game just before Christmas against the Panthers in North Carolina
The pre-season game would not be as exciting as the game against the Panthers. They had a great season last year, it should be a good game.
Yeah, but the pre-season game has cheaper tickets. That and the game against the Panthers is on my birthday and that would suck if the Packers lost.
Well, let me know if you go to the pre-season game in DC. I'd love to check out the new recruits for the Redskins.
Sure thing! I'll look at tickets tonight.
