Bambi was the saddest Disney movie ever.
Saddest?  I don't know about that.
What movie was sadder than that?
I thought Up was pretty sad.
The difference there is Bambi's mom was murdered.  In Up, she just of being old.
That doesn't decrease the heartache.
I'm just saying, one is unexpected, the other is not necessarily so.
Both deaths were not expected.
Well, you have your opinion and I have mine.
I guess so.  Mine is the right one by the way.
