Do you remember that Disney movie we went to see a couple years ago, Inside Out, about the little girl with the five emotions?
Yeah, that was a pretty good movie.
I just read a news article about how Disney is being sued for stealing someone elses idea for the movie.
It's hard to believe Disney, which makes wholesome products, would be so unethical.
I know, but this woman is a child development specialist, and she supposedly had several meetings with the Disney people about her idea, and then they stole it.
Is it possible her idea was just something similar, but not like the movie they made?
No, her idea was called Moodsters, and was 5 characters who were different emotions and each a different color.
Oh, that is a lot like the movie, where the girl was dealing with 5 different emotions who appeared as characters in different colors.
A couple months ago, a screenwriter filed a lawsuit saying Disney copied from his work when they made the Zootopia movie.
What's up with that? Disney has plenty of money, why don't they just pay these people if they want to use their ideas?
