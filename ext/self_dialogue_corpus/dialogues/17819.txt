Do you know that the band THE DOORS are coming out with a new cd in the fall?
No really? I love The Doors
It is a two  cd set with B sides, so it has a lot of songs.
That sounds great, I haven't heard them in a long time.
It also has four mono songs on it from the early years. And live songs too.
I wonder if they are going to release it in vinyl as well.
They are! A boxed set of 20 45 records.
Oh that is cool!
They are also releasing a blue ray set too.
Do you know what songs are on it?
Well almost all of them including the hits.
Light My Fire?
Definitely and Break on Through.
Sounds like a great double cd set.
Yea I think it has about forty songs on it.
I hope it is not too expensive.
Well those boxed sets are always expensive
True because they give you alot of extras.
Yea and they are like a collectors item.
I think I will save up to get it.
