I can't stand Kanye.
Can anybody?
Some can, the guy has sold millions of records.
Not me.  His music is garbage.
I actually think his early stuff was okay before he became well-known.
Ah, the old sellout argument.
Just an observation, not an argument.
I don't think he's ever been good.
Depending on who you ask, that could change.
I think he's sold records out of controversy than anything.
You mean like the Taylor Swift thing?
Right, stuff like that.
He's always made a living by staying in the headlines.
Whether or not it's bad.
I mean, why else would you marry Kim?
All about the infamy, man.
I couldn't even name any of his recent songs.
They all run together, self-serving, boring.
You probably won't be joining his fan club I take it.
Of course not!
