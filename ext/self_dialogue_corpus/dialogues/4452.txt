What do you think is the best Thriller movie?
I would go with something classic.
Such as?
Silence of the Lambs.
I do not think I have seen that one.
With Anthony Hopkins?
I know of it, never saw it.
It is nuts. He plays a cannibal.
Is that the one where he wears the mask?
Yes, and the detective has to figure out how to stop him.
