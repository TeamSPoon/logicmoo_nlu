Have you ever seen the movie Inception?
Yes it was a great thriller. Very brilliant writing and plot.
Yes I agree except I wasn't able to really understand it.
Oh you're not alone, a lot of people did.
I know one thing, it's definitely a movie that had people talking.
That's true. Another thriller I really like is Seven.
The one with Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman.
That's the one. It was a little dark for me but I liked it.
It's true that it was really dark. I couldn't watch it more than once.
Me neither. That twist at the end gave me nightmares for days.
