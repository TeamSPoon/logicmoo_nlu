Recently I started watching Korean dramas and movies
Really, why?
I just find them refreshing and different.  I enjoy seeing what is, to me, an exotic locale and how the society differs or is the same.
Isn't reading subtitles hard?
No, actually I like it. I even use subtitles sometimes on American movies because some of them seem hard for me to hear everything.
That's weird, I think I'd hate subtitles.  Do they have any dubbed versions?
Probably.  I mainly watch on DramaFever and theirs are all subtitled.
So what have you watched?
I watched Lump of Sugar, which is about a race horse.
Did you like it?
I liked it a lot, but it was a real tear jerker.  You have to remember with korean drama they don't feel like everything has to end happily ever after.
How does it end then?
The horse dies after a race.
That would be really sad.  Why did you like it then?
As someone who has worked with horses, it was very realistic.  Not idealized or fantasy.
But what's the point if the horse just dies in the end?
It was about peoples relationships to each other, and to the horse - and about that particular horses courage and desire to win.
I hate it when they race horses to death. Is it a horrible death scene?
No.  It's sad, but it isn't bloody or awful.  Lots of tears. They don't force him to race, or juice him up with painkillers like they do here either.
I still don't think I would like it.
