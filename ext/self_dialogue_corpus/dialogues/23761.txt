Tell me you've seen Wonder Woman!
Six times! I was so excited about it.
Wow, that's more than me. I've only seen it twice.
I think I'll have it memorized before it's out on DVD.
Worth it. Wasn't Gal Gadot fantastic?
She really was. Nobody can replace Lynda Carter, but Gadot is a great second.
And Chris Pine made an excellent Steve Trevor.
I thought so. All the casting was well done.
I agree. Except for Ares. Just couldn't picture it.
I know. Thewlis just doesn't say 'god of war' to me.
But the Amazons were all perfect, right?
Totally! Can you believe Robin Wright as Antiope?
Oh, I was in love with her! So strong and commanding.
She was a great general.
I could have watched a whole movie of Antiope and Diana training to fight.
Those moves were almost frightening! The way they flipped around.
And that "Shield!" manuever. I loved how Steve remembered that.
Helping Diana jump up that tower? That was great.
But the best part to me was Diana using her bracelets.
Bullet-proof bracelets! Classic Wonder Woman, so glad they included that.
