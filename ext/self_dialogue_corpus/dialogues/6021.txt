As far as sports movies, I love Miracle the best.
It was based on a true story.
How did you feel when they won the Olympic gold?
I thought the movie did a great job conveying the emotion.
I loved Kurt Russell as the head coach.
The cast all around was solid.
When they finally beat the Russians, the gold scene was ultimate.
I agree with you a bunch of college players winning was a feel good story.
Some times you cant write scripts that legitimately happen.
Russell made you fall in love with Herb Brooks
