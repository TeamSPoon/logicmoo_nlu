What would you say is the most complex music?
Define complexity.
I guess I mean the music that has the most going on in it at once.
Ah, I see. Maybe something like Johan Sebastian Bach's music, then.
OK, caveat - Music made in the past 100 years.
I think there's a lot of music that can fall into that description.
OK, name some that you think fits.
Radiohead makes music that is very deeply layered, sonically.
That's true, their music is very complex.
Actually, a genre that's often pretty complex is Heavy Metal.
I wouldn't really expect that - it mostly sounds like a bunch of noise and screaming to me.
Yeah, it's that way with a lot of people.
I guess they're playing their instruments really fast.
Yeah, there are a lot of notes being played!
How about something lyrically complex, like Lupe Fiasco's lyrics?
Sure, you could go in that direction. I was mostly thinking about the music rather than lyrics.
For lyrical complexity, how about Bob Dylan.
I wouldn't really agree. I don't think what he sang was all that complex.
A lot of symbolism, though.
Maybe. I still wouldn't say he's that complex a musician.
