Oh, I am so disappointed that Beauty and the Beast is no longer in theaters.
You didn't see it?
No! And I was so excited to see Emma Watson as Belle!
Hermione as Belle does make perfect sense, doesn't it?
It really, really does. Do you know when the movie comes out on DVD?
At the beginning of June, I think.
That's not too far away! Want to watch it with me when it comes out?
Of course! You know I'm a sucker for Disney movies.
Have you seen Moana yet?
No, though I have been planning to.
I have the DVD at my house. Are you free for a movie night at my place?
Let me check my schedule.
What's the verdict?
I'm free! Are there any other movies you want me to bring?
Hmm... The Cinderella remake was pretty good.
I agree, I'll bring my copy.
I also have several anime movies that I want to watch.
Miyzaki films?
Some of them! Ponyo is Miyazaki, but I also have a Fullmetal Alchemist movie I want to watch.
Sounds like it's going to be a fun night!
