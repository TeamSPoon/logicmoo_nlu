What did you think of The Babadook?
Loved it now that I finally got a chance to watch it. Far too often nidern day horror is disappointing.
See I knew you would like it, it reminds me of a good classic horror film.
I can certainly see the comparison, it was refreshing to not rely on so many jump scares.
Yeah for me it's all about atmosphere and this film had it in spades.
Agreed it also makes me wonder what Jennifer Kent is going to direct next.
Whatever it is I eagerly anticipate it, think she's got quite the future ahead of her.
No doubt about it, Noah Wiseman also played the bratty little kid to perfection.
He did, but not sure I would necessarily say he was bratty, well okay he was, but more a product of his environment.
Yeah that kid had things pretty rough.
