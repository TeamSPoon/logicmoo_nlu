Hey.
Hi.
We're supposed to talk about the NFL?
Yeah that's right.
Do you have a team that you like?
I like the Jets and the Panthers.
Oh two teams that's interesting.
One is where I grew up and the other is where I live now.
Is it hard to watch games for both?
Sometimes.
What do you mean?
Sometimes they will play at the same time and sometimes the coverage will be blacked out.
Oh, yeah I hate it when that happens.
It's really annoying.
They do it to make you by the packages.
Yeah and the NFL network.
Yeah that's right.
What about you, do you have a team that you go for?
No not really, I just watch a few games here and there.
Gotcha.
