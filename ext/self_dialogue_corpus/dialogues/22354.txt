Did you see Wolf of Wall Street?
No. not yet.
Leo DiCaprio is the movie.
He's great! How'd he do?
He was amazing. A great actor.
He always brings it.
It's a shame he didn't win an award for it.
That's what I hear.
Margot Robbie was also in the movie.
She's beautiful.
I know. Talented and gorgeous.
The perfect combo!
Exactly!  Her performance was great too.
She played his wife right?
Yeah. Living in a mansion and dealing with all the craziness.
What do you mean?
There was a lot of drug activity and sexual activity in the movie.
Wow! So avoid seeing it with my parents?
Yes! Its raunchy at times.
Good to know
