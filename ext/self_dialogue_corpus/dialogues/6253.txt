Hey, what's your favorite Disney movie?
I don't know, that's a really tough question, there are so many good Disney movies.
Yeah, that's true. For me though, it's easy. My favorite is the Lion King.
Why is it your favorite?
It was a huge part of my childhood. I loved the music and the animation.
Yeah, I see that. I feel the same way about Aladdin.
Oh yeah? My sister loved Aladdin. There was a period of time where she'd watch it every day after school.
Yeah, I did the same. It transported me to a magical place. What do you make of Aladdin?
I like it enough, but it doesn't compare to the Lion King for me.
Yeah, I get that. Everyone has a different Disney movie that they love.
