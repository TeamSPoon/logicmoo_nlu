What are your thoughts on the upcoming NFL season?
I think Brady is going to look good again.
I think this year might be their last full year of success.
Why do you think that?
Brad is getting very old - almost 40.
But in Belichick we trust.
Yes, he's a great coach.
This year will be another great year, I expect.
We will see. Even the mad hatter is getting old.
Although this is true, they are timeless.
I think the Packers may give them a run for their money.
We will see - I love Rogers.
Yeah, he's an amazing quarterback.
He is so precise with he football.
I hope Jordy Nelson has a great year this year.
I think he will, but he has slowed down some.
Yes, but he is still a quick and sure-handed receiver.
Ultimately, I think that the Broncos will make a return.
No Manning, no problem.
This I can agree with - go Broncos!
