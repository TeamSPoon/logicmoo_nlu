What do you think of how Rachel Maddow looks on her show?
I don't like what they are doing with her hair. Or her makeup
Oh, me either. I like gray hair.
And she has on way too much makeup right?
Yes! It's like they're trying to make her look straight.
Straight and not old. Because society fears older women who don't want to sleep with men. or who men don't want to sleep with.
She still looks great though
Yeah, I love her suits.
At least they haven't made her wear dresses yet
OR blouses or something feminine
I like the kinds of things Ellen wears on her show too
Yeah, but even with her sometimes they try to make it too feminine
Right I understand that it's television and all, but we can bring gender neutral clothing into the mainstream
Yeah, i don't even mind overtly feminine or masculine clothing. But it feels like most people are somewhere in between on the spectrum.
Yes! There are so many in between people. I wish they would show that more on television.
I like Mary Carillo's outfits as well. It's mostly pantsuits, but they fit her well.
I like Mary Carillo's hair.
Yes. It is a good cut for her
I used to not like skinny jeans, but they've grown on me.
Oh, me too. If they fit well, they are nice.
