I like the PITTSBURGH STEELERS.
They are one of the best.
They began in 1933.
They play at Hienz Field.
They train in the town of Latrobe.
They used to be an AFC Central team.
Now they are AFC north.
They have 3 uniform styles.
They are black, gold white combination.
The Rooney Family owns the team.
They are Irish.
They have owned the team since it started.
Art Rooney founded the team.
The team used to be called the Pirates.
They have the most SUPER BOWL wins.
I think they won six.
They have 30 playoff appearances.
That is like half of all the SUPER BOWLS.
They are the oldest franchise in the AFC.
They used to not win a lot.
