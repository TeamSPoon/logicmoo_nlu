Have you ever seen the Blair Witch Project?
Yes!  I watched it when I was a teen and then sometimes I rewatch it for Halloween.
I remember at the time how amazing people though it was.
Yeah, looking back it doesn't really stand the test of time.
You can tell it's not real and the story is so unbelievable.
Yea, but at the time it was uncharted territory.
Yep, probably one of the first "reality" based horror movies.
They made it look like it actually happened, then kept the actors names pretty quiet for awhile there.
It's really crazy to think about movies before the internet really took off.
I can't imagine movies before IMDB.
