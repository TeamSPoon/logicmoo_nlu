Hey Pete, what do you think of the Philadelphia Eagles this year?
The Eagles?  Oh man, I hope they tank.
Yeah, me too.  They are my least favorite team?
Mine too.  Why do you dislike them so much?
Mainly because they are in the same division as the Cowboys, who are my favorite team.
Thats a good reason, I guess.
That and they are really just very unlikeable.  They seem dirty.
Dirty as in unclean??
No dirty, as in I think they don't necessarily follow the rules.
Oh, ok.  I don't like them because I don't like the color green.
Ha ha, that's not a good reason not to like a team.
Sure it is.
Wow, then who is your favorite team?
Um, I like the New York Giants.
The New York Giants?? Why on Earth do you like the Giants.
I like them because they wear blue.
Oh wow, you can't be serious!
I am serious.
So you don't like the Eagles because they wear green and you like the Giants because you like blue.
Exactly!
