Do you think rap music will ever be like it was in the 90s again?
What do you mean?
It was competitive and cutthroat which made rappers strive for greatness and created better music.
I hope so but it's doubtful.
What do you think caused that atmosphere?
The people did, it created rivalries and the people had their favorites.
Who was your favorite rapper from the 90s?
Had to be Tupac.
He was a lyrical genius.
I would compare him to Eminem.
Mine has to be Biggie.
I liked Biggie too he was the first person I saw that had fame that was a bigger individual.
It opened doors and eyes for what is acceptable.
Yes it did.
Did you ever listen to Big Papa at parties?
That's the only song that ever played at parties.
It was the same when I was a kid too.
It's a small world.
I miss those days.
I do to but we have a lot of things to look forward to in music today.
