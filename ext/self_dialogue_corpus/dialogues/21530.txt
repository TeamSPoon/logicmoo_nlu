Have you seen Wonder Woman yet?
Yes, I saw it last week.
You're religious, right?
Yes, even though you hate me for it.
Okay, can I give a hypothetical for you?
Sure, go for it.
So, Wonder Woman takes place in a land where monotheism can be assumed to be a thing.
Right...
But, they proved that the Greek mythology is the true origin, not monotheism.
Yes, but it's fiction.
What would you do?
What do you mean?
Well, put yourself in that situation.
Which?
You believe in one God, but that's been disproven. We know it's many gods. But they're all dead now.
This isn't real.
Just play along.
Fine.
What do you do: the gods are real but Wonder Woman is the only one left. Do you worship her? She's trigger-happy.
I'm not in the mood for this right now, but I'll go ahead and say yes.
