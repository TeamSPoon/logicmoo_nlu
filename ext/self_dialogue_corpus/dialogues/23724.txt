That new Guardians of the Galaxy kind of reminded me of another film?
What,the first one?
I mean yes, but I was talking about another sort of space and moral movie.
Which one?
It's called Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy.
I heard of it.
You should check it out.
Is it a like Sci Fi movie?
Yes and no. It is more of a comedic drama. It really cover alot.
How is that like the other film.
It has adventure, but also this sort of meaningful purpose. Like the new Guardians. The meaning of the universe.
I am pretty sure Marvel does not know the meaning of the Universe.
Look at all the Marvel films in the same Vein. They always tell a story.
The old Xmen did. To an extent.
The xmen films covered a lot about acceptance and not being racist, or I guess mutanist?
They were really big emotion films.
I like when movies can be both funny but tell a message.
Sort of a funny moral you mean?
Exactly. I think films like that are classic.
The sort of dramedy movies?
