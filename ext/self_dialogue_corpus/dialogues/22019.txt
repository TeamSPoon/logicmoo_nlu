What's your go-to movie?
What do you mean?
Like, is there a movie you just have to watch every year? To get it out of your system.
Maybe Forrest Gump.
Whoa, why that?
Well, I'm from Alabama, so it's a special movie to me.
I can understand that.
It just reminds me of home.
Well, Forrest Gump really is a great movie. Tom Hanks is great in it.
Yeah. What about you? Do you have a go-to?
Well, I have some holiday movies. Like Die Hard or Home Alone at Christmas.
Sure, I get that.
And every once in a while, I just have to watch The Emperor's Club.
The Emperor's Club? I don't think I've ever heard of that.
It wasn't a big movie. Kevin Kline stars in it.
Huh. I can't even really picture him.
It's about a teacher at a boarding school who bends the rules to encourage a student, who betrays him.
That sounds pretty interesting.
Want to watch it together?
Sure, how about next week?
