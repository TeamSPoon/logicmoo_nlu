Have you seen It Follows?
No. What's that?
It's a horror movie about a monster that follows you by walking.
So it's really easy to get away from?
Sorta. But it's always walking, so you can't ever rest.
That seems really bleak.
Yeah, it was an unusual movie. Felt very out of time.
Do you usually watch horror movies?
Not all that often. I don't get scared very easily.
Ah. I can't. I won't be able to sleep if I do.
Have you seen anything good lately?
I saw the new Guardians of the Galaxy last week.
Was it any good?
Not as good as the first, but we had a lot of fun.
Chris Pratt was great in the first one.
Yeah, he's really having a moment.
I kind of want them to remake Indiana Jones with him as the lead.
I'd pay to see that!
Right? I think it's a great idea.
That might be a remake that actually works!
