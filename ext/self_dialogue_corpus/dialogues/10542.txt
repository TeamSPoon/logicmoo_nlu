How do you think the the movie industry will evolve?
As far as making them?
Delivering them.
I think eventually they will all go direct to video.
I am almost on the same page as you.
Like physical DVDs?
DVDs are even obsolete now.
So directly to Blu Ray?
Not even a physical copy.
So Netflix?
Basically I can see it doing that.
Dont you think the subscription fees for that movie service is too low?
Yeah but their pricing model will change.
So how will they measure a movie's success?
I believe you can pay to see the movie.
OK wont that cripple the movie theater industry?
Absolutely but they need to come up with creative ways.
Like putting a bar in the theater?
No people dont go to drink at a theater
Wow these are so monstrous changes
