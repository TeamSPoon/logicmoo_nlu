Guess what? One of the running backs for the Eagles will be signing footballs at the stadium next week, you ought to bring your kids.
Which running back  is this?
I think Ryan Marshall
He's pretty good. What time is this gonna take place
Monday at five o'clock
Are you gonna bring your kids
Yes, but they prefer The Giants
Yeah my kids like them too.
Mines have Giants paraphernalia everywhere
But if you want any of their stars to autograph your things you will have to go to New York
Yeah. We drove there two years ago to get jackets signed by Orleans Darkwa
Who?
One of the running backs for the Giants
Wow, was it worth it? That's a ten hour drive
Yes. The kids really wanted the autograph, it was definitely worth it. We have driven there before to see the games
My kids would rather fly. We flew to New York to see a Jets game last year.
Oh yeah, you told me about that. What signature did you get that time ?
None. We just went to see the game
Well I guess I will see you and your family at the stadium next week. Did you say five o'clock?
Yes, can't wait.
