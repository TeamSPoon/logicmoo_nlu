Have you ever seen the old live action Disney movies?
Yes, I have seen them all.
Which one is your favorite?
The Happiest Millionaire. I love it.
Oh that is a great one!
Personally, I think it is better than Mary Poppins.
Speaking of Mary Poppins, what did you think of Saving Mr. Banks?
It was so good! Tom Hanks portrayed Walt Disney really well.
Oh I agree. The backstory was interesting.
I was shocked about the real story. It was a neat movie though.
