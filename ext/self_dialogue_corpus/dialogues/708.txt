What are the chances the Cowboys make the super bowl?
I think if their offensive line is as good as last year they have a very good chance.
Will the Falcons be as good as last year?
Personally I thought last year was their best chance, I dont think Matt Ryan will have the same numbers as last year.
Will the Vikings make it to the super bowl and win it in their own city?
They have a good enough defense.  Unfortunately their offensive line hasnt improved much from last year it seems like.
Will Kirk Cousins have a good year?
No I think he is quite overrated and wont earn a large contract.
What do you think of LA having 2 teams?
LA couldnt support one team that long ago.  Not sure why they would have 2 all of a sudden.
Can the Jaguars finally put together a good season?
I think they have some good pieces but not sure they are ready to take the next step.
Who is your favorite player in the NFL?
My favorite player is Duke Johnson for the browns.  Hes a very electric player out of the backfield.
Will Teddy Bridgewater play this year?
I hope so.  Hes really fun to watch but I think theyll keep him out just to be safe so he doesnt get injured.
Are you excited for the season to begin?
Yes! I miss watching football on Sundays.
Will the Ravens make the playoffs this year?
I doubt it.  Not sure Joe Flaco can carry them that far without a solid defense.
