Grant is making up a new baseball team called the Basemasters.
That's cool. Are there tryouts?
Tomorrow at one. Are you going?
I might watch. I was thinking of my brother actually.
He's a great pitcher. He'd do great.
He really is. I bet he'd make it on the team.
Does he still practice?
He does every few days with his friends.
We haven't had a team in a long time so I see why there's so much interest. Lots of people are going so your brother will have competition.
I'll tell him about it as soon as I get home.
We should tell Jenson too. He's a great batter.
Remember that home run he hit last summer?
That was crazy.
Did they ever find that ball?
No, never.
That's hilarious. He should try out.
We'd win a lot of games with Jenson and your brother on the team.
Absolutely.
I know Grant is just going to coach and stuff.
He likes to manage and organize.
