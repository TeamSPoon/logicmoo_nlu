Have you listened to Wildflower yet?
I am not sure I know what that is.
The new Avalanches album.
Oh, of course.  I heard it but I was not really a fan of it.
I felt the same way at first but after a few listens, it has grown on me.
I think the first album was just too good, it was impossible to live up to it.
They also waited a very long time to release the second album.
Yea, it took them 16 years to make it.
I can not believe it was that long.
How can it possibly take that long, I do not understand.
I wonder how long they spent making Since I Left You.
Whatever they did for that, they just need to keep doing.
I agree, that album is a classic.
I consider it to be a greatest of all time.
What is your favorite track on the album?
I have to say Frontier Psychiatry though that is what everyone says.
That song is just so good.
I can listen to it over and over and still find new things in it.
It is all those samples, coming nonstop.
It really is amazing what they did.
