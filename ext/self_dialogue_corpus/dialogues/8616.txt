Have you ever heard John Cafferty and The Beaver Brown Band?
Not sure, what's one of their tracks?
They did the soundtrack to Eddie and The Cruisers.
Oh I love that film and soundtrack, especially On The Darkside.
I'm partial towards Tender Years.
Do they still tour?
They do actually, have always wanted to see them.
If you hear about a nearby show, let me know.
Sure will, in the meantime going to put on some of their music.
Enjoy it! Can't believe I never knew the band's name.
