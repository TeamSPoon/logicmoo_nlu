The bar is doing Star Wars trivia next week. What do you think they'll ask about?
Did Han shoot first?
Very funny. No, seriously, I want to study.
You should probably just watch the movies again.
All of them?
I mean, that makes the most sense to me.
That's a lot of time.
Well, it's a team sport, isn't it? Why don't you have each of you watch one or two.
That seems way more manageable!
I'll do it as long as I get to watch Empire.
