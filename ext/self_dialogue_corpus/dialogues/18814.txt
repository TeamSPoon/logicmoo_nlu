What do you think of Whitney Houston?
I like her music a lot, actually.
Yeah, me too.
Rest in Peace Whitney, whats your favorite song of hers?
Call me cliche, but I love "I Will Always Love You"
Not cliche at all, it's a classic.
I swear, that song is my shower song.
I love the high notes at the end.
Yes! I also love "I wanna Dance with Somebody"
Agreed, another classic there!
Whitney's definetely one of those people that had a lot of number one hits
Yeah, she was defnetely a great artist.
Did you ever get to see her in concert?
No, sadly. Did you?
Nope, my sister did though way back in the day.
That's amazing! How was it?
She said it's the best concert she's ever been to, I swear.
Well Whitney had quite the voice!
Yeah, she said she sounded just like the album.
Those are my favorite concerts!
