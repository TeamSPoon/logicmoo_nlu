What is your favorite sports movie of all time?
Any Given Sunday.
Wow that is mine too!
Who did you think did the best in that movie?
I liked Cameron Diaz in the film
I think she was too generic and typical.
Pacino was too generic in my opinion.
I liked to see his struggle the entire time.
Jamie Foxx did a great job in all fairness.
yeah you know what he had an awesome role.
I mean the idea of the film is a bit generic, but the way it was conveyed was awesome.
I think it showed just how crazy things can get in a locker room.
It was definitely a stranger piece of film.
Not really, it was a football film.
I mean in terms of how it gave meaning to what they wanted to do.
LL Cool J even had a role that was good.
He was a typical meat head like he always plays.
Yeah I admit some of the roles he plays are questionable
I dont think they are questionable just too much of the same
But the overall flow of the movie was top notch
