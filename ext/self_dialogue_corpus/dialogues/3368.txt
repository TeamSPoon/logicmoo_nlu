Did you like The Ring?
American or Japanese?
American. We all know the Japanese originals are superior.
Of course. And yes, I really liked it.
I couldn't buy Naomi Watts in it. She was irritating.
Point taken. But Samara was awesomely creepy.
Yeah, is that where she crawled out of the screen?
Yeah, but that's not what bugged me the most.
What part was?
When she slowly crawled out of the screen, but teleported next to that guy. It was shocking.
