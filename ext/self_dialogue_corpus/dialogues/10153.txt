Have you ever seen the movie Goodfellas?
Is that the one with Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci?
Yes, The story about the 3 mafia guys.
I love that movie, its really intense.
It definitely is, its one of my favorite mafia movies.
Do you remember the part in the bar?
You mean when Tommy shoots Spider? Or the part with Billy Bats?
The part with Spider, that was brutal.
He basically shot the guy for no reason.
He was such a hot head he couldn't control his anger.
