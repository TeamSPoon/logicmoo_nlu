What do you think was the best of the Christopher Nolan Batman movies?
Probably the middle one with the Joker.
The Dark Knight?
Yep.  They were all good, but that was the cake of the series.
I would agree with you there.  Heath Ledger's performance was an all-timer.
He was so creepy in it.  It's a shame he never got back in time for another one.
The ending scene was so shocking though.  I actually thought the kid might get it.
That's good movie-making in general.  They threw everything at it creatively.
I wonder if they'll ever re-explore those movies with Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
Unlikely, but you never know.
