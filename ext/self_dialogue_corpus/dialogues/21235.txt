What was it called
It was call the founder and it's about mcdonalds
I really wanted to see that. Tell me about it.
Do you mind if I spoil some of it.
Honestly no.
Okay it's about this guy who essentially rips off the original creators of mcdonalds.
Okay tell me more...
Well sort of weasels his way into the company and then starts a corporation named mcdonalds and initiates a corporate take over.
Where did you see it?
In my living room,
What other movies where released around that time?
I don't recall but it was a documentary
I don't like documentaries
Not even though they impact you on your everyday life.
Well documentaries don't but there subject matter does.
How did you find that movie?
I was just searching new releases on demand.
