Have you seen the latest Jennifer Garner movie?
No I haven´t, which one are you talking about? Nine lives or Miracles from Heaven?
Oh I didn´t know about Nine lives, I was talking about Miracles in Heaven.
So why do you ask? did you like the movie?, what is it about?
I did! I loved it!. It´s based on a book, which is supposed to be real about a girl who has a near death experience and then is cured of a disease.
Oh wow sounds very nice, I´ll give it a try later. What other movies of hers do you recommend?
Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day is very funny, actually I want to watch it again.
Sounds perfect! Why don't we do just that. Who else is in that movie?
Steve Carell, he is one of the main characters.
Oh then we definitely have to see it. I love Steve Carell, what other movies do you remember that he is in?
He is in The Big Short, Anchorman 2, Seeking a Friend for the End of the World, "Crazy, Stupid, Love", Dinner for Schmucks, Date Night, Evan Almighty, Dan in Real Life, etc...
Oh wow that's true, I have only seen Anchorman, Anchorman 2, The Big Short. Which funny one would you recommend?
Definitely Dinner for Schmucks, you´ll have a good laugh there, plus ends up as a good heart felt movie.
Perfect! I will put it in my cue. So tell me more movies about Jennifer Garner.
There is Valentine´s Day, The Invention of Lying, The Ghosts of Girlfriends Past, Juno, Catch and Release, 13 Going on 30.
She was in Juno?, no way! I know Juno was a very well acclaimed movie. What about the Invention of Lying, how is that one?
Ohh it´s very funny, it´s an hypothetical world were nobody can tell a lie, it does´t exist, until one person discovers how to lie. It´s very funny.
Really? I can't wait to watch it, it sounds very funny and fun, I can imagine. What other actors are there in this movie?
You can find Ricky Gervais, Jonah Hill.
Oh no wonder, it has a great cast as well! It should be a very good movie then. It added it to my cue, thanks!
