How are your Redskins looking for next season?
Pretty good, I hope! This Kirk Cousins thing is out of control though.
Oh, I don't know what that is.
He is our quarterback, and basically he and the Red Skins still haven't come to a long-term agreement for his contract.
Oh no! When do they have to reach an agreement by?
They need to reach an agreement by July 17th.
Oh wow, that is soon. What is the issue?
His pay. If they don't come to an agreement, he'll get paid about $24 million for just next year.
Oh I see. Hasn't he been pretty good for the Redskins?
Definitely! He was a bit of a wildcard, but he has been very good.
What happens if they don't reach an agreement?
If they don't, it could be his last season with the Redskins, and we need him a lot!
Oh no, so this could cost the Redskins a lot of money and a good player.
Exactly, hopefully it'll work out. Are you planning on going to any games this year?
Of course. I'm a big Cowboys fan, so I'm trying to plan a trip to go see them.
Oh that would be really awesome. Where is their stadium?
It's actually in Arlington, Texas, not Dallas.
Oh interesting. I have never been there. I went to a Falcons game at the Georgia dome last year.
Oh, how was that?
It was awesome. The Falcons are building a new stadium soon though.
