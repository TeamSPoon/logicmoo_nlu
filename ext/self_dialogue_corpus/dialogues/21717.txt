What do you think is the better series Harry Potter or Star Wars.
Hmmm.  They're both great but for different reasons.
You mean how Star Wars is more intense.  It's just strap in from the first second.
And how Harry Potter is more fun.
So I guess it depends on what mood I'm in.  The first 5 Harry Potter movies Hogwarts seems like a fun place.
And most of Star Wars the Galaxy seems pretty bad.  Especially on Tattoine.
So which was the best of each franchise?
Empire for Star Wars, and Half Blood Prince for Harry Potter.
I agree, those were awesome movies.
Although out of those two, I think Empire Strikes back was way better.
Maybe better but not a lot better.
Well there was the big reveal at the end of Empire.
Yeah, but many of us knew that before we saw it.
So you're saying the Dumpledore death was more of a surprise?
Yes, that's exactly what I'm saying.
However Empire was more ground breaking.
Yes, it was, just as much as the original movie.
And it showed why Vader is the baddest bad guy who ever graced the silver screen.
Yes, Voldy was bad.
But he was no Vader.
