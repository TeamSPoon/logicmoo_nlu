Where did you first hear rock songs
Mainly when I went to my dads house for the summer as a kid. He always had this great record collection of bands
What was his favorite band
He was a big fan of Deep Purple
Deep Purple? Sounds familiar! What songs do they sing?
Their most famous song is Smoke on the Water
Oh, I know that song!
Me too, I can even play it on guitar
My favorite oldies song is Iron Man
wow that's a classic!
