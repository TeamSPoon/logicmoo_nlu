I am a huge Atlanta Falcons fan.  Do you follow the Falcons?
In the past I have not, but last year they grabbed my attention.
Yeah.  They had a great year.
I can't believe they blew a 28-3 lead in the Super Bowl. Very frustrating.
I know.  Of course, my Atlanta Falcons help Tom Brady continue to build his legacy.
It's so frustrating.  As if Tom Brady doesn't get enough love as it is.
Yeah. Tom Brady will be known as the best ever for sure now.
Hey, at least Matt Ryan had is first MVP season. He was fun to watch last year.
The Matt Ryan to Julio Jones connection was on fire last year.
Unfortunately, the Falcons lost their offensive coordinator after the season.
Kyle Shanahan will definitely be hard to replace.  He did a very good job.
Yes he did.  Who did the Falcons hire to replace Shanahan?
They hired Steve Sarkisan.  He used to be the head coach at USC and he was the offensive coordinator there before that.
Oh ok.  Who do you think the biggest competition for the Falcons will be in the NFC this year?
I don't know.  I know the Cowboys and Seahawks should be good again.  I wouldn't be surprised if the Panthers rebounded from last years poor season.
Yeah.  I was thinking the same thing.  I think the Panthers are a real threat in the NFC South.
What about the AFC?  Who are the contenders?
Of course, the Patriots will be right there.  I'm curious to see if the Oakland Raiders can have another good season.
Really. That should be interesting.  I hope to see Derek Carr have another good season and stay healthy.
Right.  He will need to stay healthy to earn that big, new contract.
