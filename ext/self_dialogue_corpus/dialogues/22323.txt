Have you seen the newer movie Ryan Reynolds did?
Are you talking about Deadpool?
Yes! It is really funny and unlike any superhero movie.
I have seen bits and pieces of it.
You have to watch it from start to finish.
I have been wanting to watch it for a while now.
Ryan Reynolds plays the part perfectly, it is actually really humorous.
That is what I have heard, I just have not had time to watch it.
The action scenes and slow-mo are some of the best I have seen!
I have seen some of the action parts, they are fantastic.
They are making a 2nd Deadpool, I am not sure when it comes out.
Well I definitely need to see the first one for sure!
You will not be disappointed, I laughed so hard.
Do you have the movie? Can I borrow it?
Yes I have it.
Maybe I could come over and we can watch it together?
That sounds good! The ending was really good too.
Don't tell me the ending!
It is one of my favorite movies, can't wait for you to watch it.
Sounds good, see you tonight to watch Deadpool!
