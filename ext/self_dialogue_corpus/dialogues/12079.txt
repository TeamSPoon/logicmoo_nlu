Okay, do you think Disney will drive our love for SW into the ground?
I'm not excited about all these spin-offs
On paper, it seems cool to have things divert from the story/rules of the franchise
Right. But Rogue One was basically a prequel
That was so disappointing. Shades of Dirty Dozen but overwhelmed by tying in it
That is the problem, Disney. All those reshoots rumors
Yeah, they probably just used the reshoots to tie it into the franchise
I don't care to see young Han Solo. I'd love for complete stand-alone stories
Like?
A Mace Windu story would be awesome. Or, I mean, Vader's hunt of the Jedi. We got a tiny taste in Rogue One
