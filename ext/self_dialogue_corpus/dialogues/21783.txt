Have you ever seen Saving Private Ryan?
That was an amazing and emotional movie.
Yeah, maybe Tom Hanks best work.
That was all business right from the start with the landing in Normandy.
It was horrifying.  I have a lot of respect for those guys.
Me too.  There was so much talent in the movie.  It was so well written.
Yes, like the part where the sniper killed the other sniper through the skope.
It was sad when the medic died taking that machine gun nest.
Yeah, that's the reality of war though.
Lets not forget the final battle scene.
That whole thing was crazy.  That Panzar blowing everything up.
Mostly everyone didn't make it either.
Except Private Ryan did.
And it turns out that old man at the end was Rya.
I know, so deep of a movie.
The score by John Williams was absolutely epic as well.
I agree.  They put a lot of work into that movie.
They sure did.  It felt gritty and real.
Like that's how they really were.
Yes, almost the perfect movie.
