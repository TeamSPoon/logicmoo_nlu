So, my friend and I are doing a sushi night, and we're looking for music to listen to. Any suggestions?
What, like Japanese music?
Yeah. You know about that sort of thing don't you?
I'm at least a little familiar.
Well, what would you suggest.
Hmm. First off, there's this song by Kyu Sakamoto. It's called Sukiyaki in English.
Sukiyaki?
In Japanese it's a kind of soup. The real title is Walking While Looking Up.
Why'd they change it?
American audiences couldn't pronounce the real title.
That's really funny. It sounds like a good choice.
Yeah. And also, maybe something by Happy End.
Happy End?
Their sound Kaze wo Atsumete plays at the end of Lost in Translation.
Any particular album?
Harumachi Roman.
Okay, got any others for me?
Maybe try something by The Pillows? They sound a bit like The Beatles.
Now that sounds like a lot of fun!
I hope you have a great sushi night!
