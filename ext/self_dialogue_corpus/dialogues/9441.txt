Do you like rap music?
Not really but I know a lot of people do.
I am not a big fan either but I am aware of some rappers.
Yeah, isn't Drake a rapper?
I think so.  I think Kanye West and Jay J are too.
I've always thought that rap music was really rough and harsh.
That and very sexist.  I mean, I've heard somewhere where they rap about raping women and stuff.
I've heard that too.  Personally rap music just makes me really uncomfortable.
Me too.  It seems like a way to get people angry and riled up.
And then they go and do bad things.
