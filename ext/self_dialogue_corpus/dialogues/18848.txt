What kind of music did your parents listen too.
Well my dad loved Doris Day, although I do not know why.
Well I think she was pretty famous back in the seventies.
Yea she had some hits I guess.
Yes I remember that song Que Sera Sera, always hated that song.
I think she sang Sentimental Journey as well.
And one about Cape Cod.
Yea. What did your dad listen to?
He listened to a lot of different music, Doris Day was one of them.
Anyone else?
Oh sure. He loved Carly SImon.
Now that I can listen too.
Me too, I always liked her music.
She had some good songs as well.
Yes, Your so Vain, No secrets and more.
Did you know she had terrible stage fright?
No I did not know that, you could never tell.
I know. She was really popular.
I wonder if she is putting out any new music?
I haven't heard of any.
