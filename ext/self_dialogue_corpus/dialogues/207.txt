Did you like the Sandman?
I liked the scene where he came to life
What about his personal life
He killed Uncle Ben for no reason
The Sandman got lucky since Spiderman could not kill him
It was interesting that Aunt May said that Spiderman did not kill people
She knew the real Spiderman better than Peter
Our friends know us better than we know ourselves at times
I feel like Sandman deserved a second chance
I feel like it was the real Peter talking forgiving him
