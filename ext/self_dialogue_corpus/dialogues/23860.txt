Whats the last movie you've seen?
Okay, so you have Hulu, right?
No, I have Netflix though.
Okay, well anyway, on Hulu they recently added Ace Ventura.
Ace Ventura? I've never heard of it.
What? It's amazing...
Whose in it?
Jim Carrey, you know who he is?
Oh, yeah he's hilarious!
Yep, he plays Ace Ventura.
Well whats the plot?
Basically, Ace Ventura gets into a bunch of trouble.
I see.
The one in particular I watched was one centered on animals, he saved them and stuff.
That sounds like a trip.
Definetely, Carrey is amazing.
Like, he's super in character?
It's like, his facial expressions are hilarius, espcially when talking to other people.
Well I'll have to watch it!
Yes, you need to.
