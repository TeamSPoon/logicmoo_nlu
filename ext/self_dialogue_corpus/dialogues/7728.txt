I enjoupyes the Goblet of Fire
That was a good movie, i hate cedric diggory had to die though
Me too, but other than that the games were really cool
Yes, like when they had to figure out how to breathe underwater
And harry of course did it best
He has too hes the main character
Thats true
That one was the longest and by far my favorite
It was really good
Definitrly
