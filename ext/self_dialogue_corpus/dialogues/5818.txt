Have you seen many Disney movies recently?
I watched Moana a short time ago. That one was all right.
I haven't seen one of their animated efforts since Frozen.
That one was great.
I really liked it too. It was a bit different from the normal formula and just well done all round.
Some of the ones that came before it were mixed bags, like Tangled and Brave.
I liked Tangled, but Brave was just not very good.
That one was just weird. It started being about one thing, and ended up somewhere completely different.
Yeah, it was a little disjointed. Did you hear there's a Frozen 2 on the way?
I hope it's not horrible like most Disney sequels.
