Seen any good movies lately?
I don't know about good, but I saw Arrival last night
I heard Arrival was good!
Me too....and having high expectations made me disappointed
Really? why?
It was just kind of hard to follow
Oh I see what you're saying.
You might like it though! Everyone else seemed to.
Well, I saw Nocturnal Animals. Another Amy Adams movie
Ohhh I loved that movie! I saw it a few months ago.
Yah! It made me think a lot.
Made me think, too. Poor Jake Gyllenhol.
I know! I felt so bad for him.
And I hated Amy Adams.
Yah, how could you have an abortion and hide it from your husband?
Omg I know. That part made me so sad.
And then she was cheating on him, too!
yah. How could you cheat on him?
Well, we should see a movie together soon.
Agree!
