Has anyone seen the new Transformers movie yet?
It just came out the 20th of June, so I plan on seeing it Friday!
DO you know who is playing in it?
Mark Wahlberg, Anthony Hopkins, Laura Haddock, Josh Duhamel are some of the names in this summer movie.
I noticed that this movie has grossed already $260 million dollars already and its not even toward the first weekend yet!
Wow. These guys make so much money it's nuts!
Who was the director of it?
Michael Bay directed this one, he does an amazing job with directing.
I enjoy his movies as well.
Maybe we can go see it together?
