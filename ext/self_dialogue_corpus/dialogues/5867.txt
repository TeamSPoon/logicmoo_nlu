Is Splash Mountain in Disneyland based on any movie?
Song of the South.
I haven't heard of that movie.
You can't get it in the United States as Disney never released it on video.
Why not?
There are those who feel it's controversial and racial.
But the music is so good.
I know and the ride makes it look like it's a good story.
Do you think it might come out one day?
Probably not.
