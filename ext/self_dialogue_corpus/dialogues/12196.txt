How many main people will die in the next movie?
I was so sad that Han Solo died.
I know, but it was part of the story.
I know, but the whole thing was sad.
I hated when Chewi started to wail.
Do you think they will kill the Luke character?
I think the next movie will focus on him.
I hope the next one shows why Kylo Ren went bad.
They hinted to it in the Force Awakens.
I hope it is not silly teen angst stuff.
