Hey have you seen the new Jack Reacher movie?
Are you talking about never go back?
Yep, that's the one! I thought it was an awesome movie an it has me anxious for the third installment!
Are they doing a third one for sure?
Not sure just yet, nothing official has been announced yet. I guess i am just hoping!
I seen the second one and thought it was pretty good. Although it is probably not one that I would want to watch again.
Really? I thought it is was even better than the first one.
Not to me, the first one was one of my all time favorites. I cant really say that about the sequel.
I am that way about most sequels, but this one was an exception for me.
I just wished they would have put more action scenes throughout the movie.
There was enough action for me, I enjoy movies where they build up the mystery a little more.
I guess I am hopeful they will make a part three.
Would you really want to watch it since the sequel let you down?
Oh yea, for sure. I am a big fan of the book series that led to the movies.
Wow, I didn't even realize that the jack reacher movies were based on books. I feel silly now!
I am sure a lot of people are the same way. They are from Author Lee Child, and each movie gets its story based off of one of the books.
Cool, how closely do the plots from the books align with the actual movies?
Very similar, although they did not go in order in terms of which book came next in terms of the sequel.
Well if they do come out with a third installment we will defenitley have to check it out.
No doubt! I look forward to checking out Tom Cruise return as Jack Reacher!
