That new person at work is going to end up with a nose like Pinocchio!
What? Made of wood?
No, I mean if he doesn't stop lying his nose will grow like Pinocchio's did.
Oh, I follow you now!
He had a tough time poor old Pinocchio.  He was led astray!
Remember Candlewick when Pinocchio goes to Pleasure Island?
I do, he was the guy who turned in to a donkey?
That's the one, I though he deserved it.
I wasn't a massive fan of Mangiafuoco either.
No but the scene with the dancing puppets was great!
