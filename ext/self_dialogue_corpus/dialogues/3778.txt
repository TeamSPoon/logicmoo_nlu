Do you like movies that mess with your mind?
Yeah, as long as it's not too creepy
Have you heard of Memento?
Yeah, I saw it on Netflix a while ago!
What do you remember from it?
It's about a guy with short term memory loss and he is trying to find a murderer
Yeah, he wants to find who killed his wife
How did she die again?
I can't tell you, that would give the plot away!
I'll watch it again I guess, I just remember liking the ending a lot!
