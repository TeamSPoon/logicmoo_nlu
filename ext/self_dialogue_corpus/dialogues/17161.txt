Do you like Kenny Chesney?
I am not sure I heard of him what does he sing?
I am sure you heard of him he is a Country artist
Hmmm, I still can't remember what he sings
He has tons of songs out but he sings Big Star, American Kids, She thinks my tractor is sexy
I will have to check him out, Have you ever seen him in Concert?
I have seen him 12 times he puts on the best shows he usually comes 4th of July Weekend
I will have to listen to his songs
I am sure once you listen to them you will recognize them
probably, I am just not good with names
his latest song is Cosmic Hallelujah
oh I think I just heard that
We normally see him at Heinz field and it like  a big beach party
oh that sounds like a lot of fun
he isn't coming this year, I am so upset
what is your favorite song by him
I could never pick just one song we go on long trips and we just play his playlist it lasts fo rhours
I am going to listen to some of his stuff while I drive home today
he was voted ACM entertainer of the year a bunch of times,  He puts on a really good show
sounds like something I would like
