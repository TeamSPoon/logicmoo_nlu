Bro, if you had to take one quarterback this year, who would it be?
Oh man that's a tough question, it's gotta be either Rodgers or Brady.
You gotta pick one to take you to the Super Bowl.
I'll go with Brady, he's probably the best quarterback to ever play the game.
I would argue that he isn't, I think he just got with a great coach at a perfect time.
The guy has won 5 super bowls and owns so many records. You're crazy if you don't think he's the best
I think the best way to look at it is when he was hurt that one season.
When he tore his ACL?
Yeah, he gets hurt, and Matt Cassel comes in.
You mean the Cassel that was terrible in Kansas City?
Yes indeed. The same Matt Cassel that has now played terribly on 5 more NFL teams.
So what's your point?
Matt Cassel came in and led the Patriots to an 11-5 record.  And put up some great stats doing it.
Yeah I remember that, I think they franshise tagged him after that year.
Right, he was awesome for the Patriots, got a big contract playing somewhere else, then was terrible.
So what does that have to do with Brady not being the best ever.
I think it's pretty clear that Belichek is the great one here, and can win with anyone under center.
He's done it for so long though.
All I'm saying is, there's better quarterbacks out there, like Rodgers, who havent had the advantage of having the best coach of all time.
Agree to disagree.
