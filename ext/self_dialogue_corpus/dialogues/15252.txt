Have you heard of Alex G?
I haven't. Is he any good?
I love his music.
What kind of genre is he?
He's hard to describe. He's lo-fi, but he plays a lot of genres.
What kind?
His last record featured lo-fi to even nu-metal type elements.
Dang. What's the album called?
"Rocket". It just came out a few weeks ago.
I'll have to check it out. Is it on Spotify?
It is actually. I listen to it everyday there.
I'll add it to my daily mix then.
He has several albums on there as well.
I have some catching up to do then.
Yeah, all of them are great listens.
Any album I should start with?
Honestly, they're all good starts.
I'll just start with his last album then.
Tell me what you think of it!
Will do!
