You know I was thinking the other day did the ancient Egyptians have  written music?
That's a very interesting question. What did you find out?
They didn't but they obviously had instruments as depicted in paintings.
That makes me think of the BAngles and "Walk Like an egyptian"
Fun song that everybody has copied that walk even Steve Martin.
Yes you are right!
How many songs can we think of that have to do with walking like some one or something.
baby elephant walk
Moves like jagger
the stripper
boots were made for walking
wow Nancy Sinatra that was a cheesy song
What kind of music do you think you despise the most
no question abstract jazz
really I am surprised I like jazz in all forms
Not me I can handle smooth cool jazz but not that crap that sound like a animal being tortured
That's funny that's how I feel about opera!
I can see how opera could be annoying but it can be very moving even when you don't know the language
Phantom of the Opera is one of my favorite musicals
i am with you on that. I have seen it 3 times
