So any theories about the Last Jedi?
Well, I think we'll learn more about Snoke and what he is trying to do.
What do you mean?
Well, Snoke doesn't seem to be following the Sith traditions, but trying to create a new Dark Side tradition.
So, he looked back and saw flaws in the Sith.
Yeah, it be hard not to, the Sith went from a dominate galactic power to an obscure cult with only two members at a time.
So Snoke is avoiding the classic defintion of insanity, off doing the smae thing over and over and expecting a different result.
Yeah, he seems to be trying to create a Dark Side tradition as strong as the SIth, but with more self-discipline.
So basically, same evil power, but less moustache twirling and ego mania?
Basically, yes.
