What do you think was the best zombie movie of all time?
There's really only one choice.  Night of the Living Dead.
For sure.  Even if it's not THE BEST in terms of plot it's actually way up there.
It is, not only that it was ground breaking.
The way the zombies kept coming, we've never seen that before Night of the Living Dead.
And the famous line, they're coming to get you Barbara.
I love that line.  One of the best in movie history.
One criticism, the consistency could use some work.  Medium zombies, slow zombies, they were all over.
Yeah but the plot and acting were great, and give it some slack it was the first of it's kind.
Definitely one of the scariest movies ever made.
