Who is your favorite actress?
Greatest living actress is Meryl streep.
Well that is a definitive answer.
I fully believe she is the best.
But there are so many other talents.
None can't truly compete with meryl.
How can you say that?
Streep is able to become the character. She can play anything.
I will say she is very transformative in some of her roles.
Julia childs was one recent time.
Yes that was a good portrayal.
No other actress would have pulled it off as well.
That is not a fair statement since no other actress had the chance.
I suppose but I still think she is the only one capable of that performance level.
Where did she study or did she?
She went to Yale for drama.
They have a very good acting program.
Lupita came from there as well. First year out and she makes it big.
Lucky girl, not all actors find fame or success.
True, but she is a very talented one as well. But  still no Meryl.
