Did you hear about Ngoepe ?
You mean the first black African to play in the Major Leagues?
Yes, I did.

I guess you can say that.
It’s really an unspoken thing.
Let's wait and see how he does and how he is treated.
As a baby, in the waning days of apartheid, Ngoepe lived in a hut in Limpopo, the northernmost province in South Africa.
Needing a way to provide for her sons, Maureen left the children with her parents and found work cleaning houses.
He has come a long way. I am sure of it but this is a whole different situation.
He is in the Major Leagues now.
Yeah. Life as he once knew it is over.
He has a tattoo of Africa on his left shoulder, and I think he already knows life will be different when he returns home.
You know he  scored a run against the Cincinnati Reds after a wild pitch on Tuesday?
No, I didn't. I have been a little too busy lately to keep up with baseball.
One of his teammates hugged him after he hit a single off the Chicago Cubs’ Jon Lester late last month.
I saw that game. That was Kimera Bartee who hugged him.
I think he will be alright for the sport.
