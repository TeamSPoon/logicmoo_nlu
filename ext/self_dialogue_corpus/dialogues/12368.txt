Which star wars movie is your favorite?
I liked the one with Darth Maul in it.
Oh wow, that one is old.
Yea but it had the best fight scenes.
Yea it was pretty good, but the new one is better in my opinion.
You think so?
Definitely, Rey is the coolest character so far.
I'll admit, she is pretty awesome.
The next one is going to be even better.
We'll have to wait and see.
