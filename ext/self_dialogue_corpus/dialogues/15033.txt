I really enjoy comedies
Me too.
Have you seen a million ways to die in the west?
Yes, it was so funny.
I didnt think id like it, but it was great
They need more movies like that
Yea it was one of those movies, that's so stupid its funny,
One of my favorite parts was the part about the pictures
Yea that was great
It was funny the entire movie
