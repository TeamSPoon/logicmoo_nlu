I wa thinking about doing a Star Wars marathon this weekend.
That sounds cool. What order?
I haven't decided yet. Release order or numerical order, what do you think?
I'm a traditionalist. I like to start with A New Hope.
That's how I usually do it, but I was thinking about starting with The Phantom Menace.
Do you have the original movies or the remastered ones?
Both! I collect every DVD as soon as it comes out.
Me too. Plus I see them in theater as soon as they open.
Same here. I only missed one of them, and that's because I was a baby.
Lucky you.
