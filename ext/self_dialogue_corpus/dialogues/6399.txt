My daughter's 4th birthday is coming up and she wants a Disney princess party.
My daughter just went to one last month. It was pretty cute.
You should bring her! Kayla is dressing as her favorite Disney princess, Ariel.
Isabelle would love that! She'll probably go as Belle, her favorite because of the name.
Oh, there are so many more reasons to like Belle! She's my favorite!
She's an avid reader just like me. And she doesn't fall for just any guy.
Exactly! Gaston had no chance!
There is so much you can learn from Belle too! Like the importance of family, and reading.
And staying true to yourself, no matter what people think.
And of course, how to look beyond someone's exterior, because you never know what "beast" may turn out to be your true love!
