Do you follow baseball
only a little
Did you see the World Series last year?
Just the final game
Who is your favorite team
The Rockies
Oh, they've really struggled
Yeah, I used to cheer for the Reds when I lived in Cincinatti
Who was your favorite Reds player
Of all time it would be johnny bench
Not Pete Rose?
I like Charlie Hustle but he's still tainted I suppose
Kind of like Bonds
Yep, still one of the great pure hitters
I never saw him play but my dad did
My dad was a big New York Yankees fan back in the day
Too bad the Dodgers left
Yes, that was some rivalry
You don't get those kinds of rivalries these days
No, it's all professional
