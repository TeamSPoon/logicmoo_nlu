You know if Christian Ponder is still in the league?
Who that?
The dude from the Vikings.  Married a hot chick.  Took over from Worm-Killer McNabb.
Worm-Killer?
Used to bounce passes to the receivers.
Ok.  Well, never heard of him.  Don't know where he is and don't care.
You missed out; he was awful.
I really don't care.
Air balls all over the place.  Scared to take a hit. Just plain bad.
Maybe the line wasn't any good.
Don't you try to make excuses for him!  He stunk in high school, he stunk in college, and he stinks in the NFL.
What do you have against him?  Lots of QBs stink.
The NFL is a big boy league.  If you can take it like a man then you oughta quit.
Are we still talking football?  I'm sensing that you are drifting into some personal stuff.
I'm talking Ponder.  He's a stiff, a has-been, a never-was, a I'm-running-home-and cryin-to-mama kind of player.  Just like Jim Everett.
He made it to the NFL so he must have had some skills.
Blackmail was his skills.  He had something on something.
I just read that he's earned almost $11,000,000 in the NFL.
Not worth a penny!!!  He's a bum!
Keep in mind, that's $11,000,000 more than you earned in the NFL.
