What is your favorite comedy?
One of my favorites is Tommy Boy.
I loved that one. Chris Farley and David Spade worked great together.
Black Sheep wasn't quite as good, but I like that one too.
One of the more underrated comedies is PCU.
Who was in that?
Jeremy Piven and David Spade.
I remember now. That was really funny.
And still relevant in today's world, even if it is so 90s it hurts.
Spade never did much beyond the 90s. That was kind of his decade.
