What are your thoughts about the remake of Beauty and the Beast that came out this year?
I thought Emma Watson was a great choice for Belle!
Same.  I thought she did a great job with the singing.
I wonder if they considered anyone else for the role?
I'm not sure if they did or not.
At first, I was worried she'd seem a little too young to play Belle, even though she's in her 20s.
That's true!  But Belle is pretty young in the animated version, so I think Emma was a good choice.
What about the Beast though!  Them together didn't work all that will in my opinion.
Right?!  He seemed so much older than her!
Agreed.  It was kind of awkward at the end when he turns back into the prince because he looks like he's probably 15 years older than her.
