What do you think of Madonna?
I liked some of her songs.
I liked some of them, too.
I really didn't care for her as a person.
She has done a good job staying relevant for 30 plus years.
Has she really?
I think she has.  She's always trying to reinvent herself.
I don't think some of these have been for the better.
What do you mean?
At a certain point just act your age.  She is in her late 50s.
Yeah but she still looks good for being that old.
I don't think she has ever really looked good.
Oh, come on.  She was pretty attractive in the 80s and 90s.
She wasn't bad look, but she was no beauty queen either.
I think that's why her music was so good because she wasn't a beauty queen.
I do think it helped add some emotion to her songs.
She lived a life before becoming super famous.
I think that helps artist.  To have some life experience before writing and singing songs.
So if you had to give Madonna an overall score for her music.  What would you give her?
Oh, she's first ballot hall of fame.  She's an icon, no doubt.
