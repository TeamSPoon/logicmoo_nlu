Can you believe it is the 15th anniversary of Lilo and Stitch?
Are you serious, it can't have been that long ago...
I know I feel so old. Disney store is having 15th year anniversary products.
You're telling me, I swear it was just yesterday that came out. Anything cute up for sale?
Umm when is stitch not cute? He is totally still my favorite Disney character!
I know you love him. But I mean come on Pascal is pretty cute too and he has Maximus as a side kick.
Yeah but Stitch has Angel and like 625 other cousins to keep him company! And Pudge of course...
True true... I had totally forgotten they did more than one Stitch movie. And I mean who can argue about Pudge; I mean he controls the weather...
How could you forget that? There were three movies and a tv show; once again proving he is the best.
Agree to disagree. Although now I am hungry for a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.
