If you could pick one kind of music to listen to, what would that be?
I have to say that I still love the 80's rock music.
I know.  Groups like Bon Jovi, Van Halen, and Def Leppard.
I know.  It's hard to beat those great acts.
I really like listening to that music especially when I'm working out.
Kind of gives you energy, doesn't it.
That music just always had good rhythms and good hooks in their choruses.
I think it also brings me back to the time of my youth.  Bring back some really good memories.
It just seems to have more appeal then some of the pop music of today.
Those guys were pretty talented.
I've seen a lot of them in concert.  Those were some great shows.
What was the best one your saw?
Well, we took turns in line for 3 days to get tickets to see Journey.  It was worth every minute of it.
I saw Bon Jovi for their "Slippery When Wet" tour.  That was a great show too.
I can't believe those guys are still going strong at their ages.  That's a lot of stamina.
Yes.  It's so weird that my kids now listen to some of the same music I listened to at their age.
My son and I like to get in the car and turn up "Bohemian Rhapsody" from Queen and sing at the top of our lungs.
That would be a sight.
Wonder if any of the acts of today will have the same longeviity?
I don't know, but I seriously doubt it.
