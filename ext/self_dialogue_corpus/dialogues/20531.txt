Have you ever seen Four Brothers?
No. Who's in it?
Mark Wahlberg, Tyrese Gibson, and Terrance Howard are all in it.
Cool. So what's the movie about?
It's about four adopted brothers who all come together to avenge their mother's death.
Wow. It sounds very dramatic.
The movie has a lot of action packed scenes.
Any plot twists?
Yeah there's a few here and there, but you'll have to watch the movie to find out what they are.
Point taken. Are there any other action movies you would recommend?
I would definitely recommend the Jason Bourne movies.
Have you seen the newest one?
Not yet, but I've seen the first three.
I was so shocked when they came out with a fourth one.
Me too. I was not expecting that.
Those movies never get old though.
You're right. Matt Damon is a good actor.
Did you ever see him in Elysium?
No, I never got around to it.
It was great. It was so nice to see Jodie Foster on the big screen.
