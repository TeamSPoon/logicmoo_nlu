Who is your favorite current female singer?
Holy crap, that's touch. There's so many.
Thoughs?
Sarah Bareilles, Sia, Adele, Lady Gaga...
Sia and Adele I can understand. Gaga is just obnoxious. And who is Sarah Bareilles?
Gaga's obnoxiousness is behind her and doesn't have anything to do with her talent.
She's not that good.
Have you listened to her? She can do any style and is classically trained!
Yeah right.
No really, she studied at Julliard. She also sings country and metal.
Hmm, still that meat dress...
That has nothing to do with it.
Anyway, Sarah?
Sarah Bareilles is a fantastic singer who usually performs just small venues.
Sounds like she's not well-known.
No, everyone knows her music. "Brave" was her big hit, and she has a lot on the radio.
Her concert venues sound pretty hipster.
I like her. She doesn't need $200 million to be happy. She tours when she wants and doesn't have crazy concerts.
I prefer Ariana Grande.
You're 37. That's really, really weird.
