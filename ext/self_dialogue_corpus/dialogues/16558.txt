I'm getting married and we don't know what song to choose as our first dance; any suggestions?
I will always love you by Whitney Houston is a great song for couples, especially for weddings!
I do like that song, but it reminds me of the Bodyguard movie and all the tragedy Whitney had in her life.
I totally understand that.  How about Can't Help Falling in Love by Ingrid Micaelson?
That is a great song, did you know that Ingrid wasn't the first person to sing that song?
I didn't know that!  Who was?
Elvis Presley did it in 1961; it was featured in the movie Blue Hawaii.
No kidding!  I had no idea!  Elvis was a legend, my favorite Elvis song is Love me Tender.
All Elvis songs were great!  Did you know his daughter Lisa Marie is also a singer?
I didn't know that, what songs has she done?
She's had a bunch of songs, but I don't think any were major hits.
I don't think i've ever heard any.
She actually did a duet with Elvis, it's called Don't Cry Daddy
I will have to check that out, I've never heard of it!
I'll have to keep thinking about what song I want to use for our dance, but I do know that I want Sugar by Maroon 5 played!
I love that song!  It's a classic wedding song and the video was great!
I know!  I read that the group actually surprised people during their real weddings and came out and sang!
That is so awesome!  Can you imagine Maroon 5 crashes your wedding and performs for everyone!
That would be the ultimate wedding present!  They can crash my wedding anytime they want!
I know!  Adam Levine is so hot!
