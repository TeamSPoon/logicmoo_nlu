What was the last comedy movie you saw?
I saw Central Intelligence recently.
Is that the one with Dwayne and Kevin?
Yeah, and The Rock is super crazy in it.
He's a huge child that just destroys people.
The best thing was when they were in the bar and that guy joked about his unicorn shirt.
I almost lost control of my bladder at that part.
He didn't even break a sweat with those guys, then they just walk out.
Kevin's face was priceless watching him throw guys around.
Kevin's face is usually priceless, he has great reaction faces.
