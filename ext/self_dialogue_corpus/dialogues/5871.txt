We should go see a movie today.
That's a great idea. Are there any Disney movies playing?
Why Disney?
I've just been in the mood for one.
Hmm, well, it doesn't look like it right now.
Could we just rent one then?
Sure! What would you like to rent.
Either Aladdin or The Little Mermaid.
Let's do Aladdin then!
Okay!
