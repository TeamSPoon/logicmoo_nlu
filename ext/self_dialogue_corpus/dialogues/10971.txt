I've been a St. Louis Blues fan for all of my life.
I'm sorry to hear that.
Yeah, they have one of the longer droughts for lacking a championship in professional sports
You got that right - they are one of those unlucky franchises.
Yeah, what makes it worse is that half the teams make the playoffs in the NHL and they still haven't gotten the Stanley Cup.
Yeah, I hear you, but if it's any consolation, I think the Stanley Cup playoffs is one of the most unpredictable in sports. The number one seed rarely wins the cup.
Yeah, I guess, but I think that logic goes either way. The unpredictably should mean the Blues could have won the cup.
Maybe you have a point. Maybe it's bad luck or bad drafting or bad general management.
What makes it worse is that they had there best shot before there were expansion franchises. Now it will be even harder.
Yeah, I hadn't thought of it that way. It may be another 50 years before the Blues win the Cup.
God I hope not, I'll be dead if that's the case.
Think of it this way. The longer the drought, the sweeter the victory... just look at the Cubs.
I'd take multiple championships, thank you very much.
Dynasties don't happen in the NHL like they used to.
True. I think expansion has made it harder - it dilutes the talent.
And things will get worse when that Las Vegas team enters the league.
Tell me about it. There will be some good players taken from a lot of teams.
Hopefully, that will be it for the expansion franchises in the NHL.
Someday the Blues will win the Stanley Cup.
I'll party in St. Louis when it happens!
