What do you like to listen on XM radio.
I don't know. Depends on my mood.
Well, what are your favorite music stations?
The decades channels, 90s and pop2k are both pretty good.
Agreed, although I haven't listened to pop2k much.
You really should give it a shot. It has some great old school jobs. Smashmouth?
ohh so it's a lot of stuff like that?
Not just alternative. Lots of old school hip hop. Like Fat joe, ashanti, etc.
I can see myself being in the mood for that.
Exactly.
Any other channels you suggest?
Umm, some of the other channels like XM cafe are good if you're looking to just relax.
Yeah, I'm not into that as much.
There's also studio 54 which is like disco. That's pretty funny. Also a new beatles channel.
I can't believe they have a beatles channel. It's like there are so many other bands.
I know right, seriously, where's a Michael Jackson channel or something.
Yeah, I'd be down for that. The beatles are just so overrated.
Totally agreed.
Well thanks for the suggestions.
No problem.
