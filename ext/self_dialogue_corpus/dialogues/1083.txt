When does the NFL season start?
I think preseason starts early August.
I just checked, you are right the first game is Dallas vs. Arizona on August 3rd.
That is earlier than I thought.  Dallas is going to be good again this year.
I wonder if Dak Prescott will improve in his 2nd year.
He was really good as a rookie.  It will be hard to improve on that.
True, but he will be taking reps with the first team and have all the preparation time he didn't have last year.
That is a good point, and their O-Line and run game gives them great balance on offense.
What other teams do you think will be good this year?
The Patriots will be, they are always solid.
I agree, what about Carolina?  Do you think they can get it together.
I don't know, I was surprised they dropped off so much after a 15-1 regular season where they went to the Superbowl.
Cam Newton must have been injured or something, I think they can get back on track.
I would like to see it.  What about Seattle, they are always a contender.
They will be good, but with Lynch gone their run game has struggled and I'm not sure how Eddie Lacy will do.
Lynch is with the Raiders now, coming back out of retirement.
The Las Vegas Raiders, I wonder how he will be after not playing for a while.
Running backs tend to drop off quickly and go from dominant to unproductive very quickly.
Just ask Priest Holmes, LT or any of the others.
Agreed, I hope he does well though.  He is fun to watch with his running style and skittles.
