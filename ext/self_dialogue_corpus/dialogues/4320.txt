I just saw Black Swan.
Never saw it.  Who's in it?
Natalie Portman as a ballerina.
Neat.  Who directed?
Darren Aronofsky.
What's the plot?
Natalie Portman competes for the role of the black swan in Swan Lake.
Cool.  What happens in the end?
She kills another dancer, nails the performance but dies in the end.
Sounds cool.
