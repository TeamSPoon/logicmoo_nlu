Man, I've been really getting into Woodstock lately.
Really, why Woodstock?
I don't know, I think it's one of the most interesting times in our history, and probably the first time music was really at the heart of a cultural revolution.
Yeah, I guess I know what you mean.
I've been studying Bob Dylan lately especially. I never realized how pivotal he really was.
Man, he had some really great music.
Yeah, but it's not just that. There were these two movements going on in the early 60s: pop music was exploding and there was this indie folk scene going on too.
Didn't the Beatles use some Bob Dylan songs?
Sure did, and the thing with the late 60s is pop and folk started to merge into what became the counter culture protest music.
That's so interesting.
Also interesting that the two that really kicked off all this — Bob Dylan and The Beatles — were nowhere near Woodstock.
Really?
Well, John Lennon was back in the UK because the FBI was harassing him, and Dylan I think just wasn't interested.
Dylan wasn't interested?
Nope. He even owned a home in Woodstock. Though you know it wasn't actually held in Woodstock.
Wait what?
Yeah, it's called Woodstock because originally it was supposed to be held there but ultimately it was held in Bethel, NY, nearby.
No kidding.
Yeah, Woodstock is full of interesting stories like that. Iron Butterfly didn't play because they demanded a helicopter and the organizer said no.
Man, Woodstock is so interesting.
