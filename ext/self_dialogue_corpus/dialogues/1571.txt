How do you think the Browns are going to do this season?
You already know the answer to that.
Yeah, but they could improve.
They are the worst team in the league.
Brock Osweiler might start as quarterback though, and he was pretty good for the Broncos.
The Cleveland Browns only won one game last season. They are hopeless.
You're being so cynical.
The only time the Browns were enjoyable to watch in the past decade was when Brian Hoyer played for them.
Yeah, he was pretty good.
Yep. They almost won half of their games when they had him.
I guess you're right. The Browns aren't a very good team.
They can't seem to get it together.
I just wish they would at least win against the Steelers every season.
Ah, the old Steelers vs Browns rivalry.
It's so frustrating whenever the Steelers win.
I wonder when Ben Roethlisberger is going to retire.
I don't know. How old is he now?
He's got to be close to 40. He's played for a while now.
True. I wonder who was the oldest football player to retire.
I don't know. Peyton Manning seemed pretty old when he retired at 39.
