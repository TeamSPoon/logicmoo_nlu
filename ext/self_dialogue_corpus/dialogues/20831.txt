What was the scariest movie you watched as a kid?
My parents really never let me watch a lot of scary movies.
None at all?
Well, I was terrified of Jaws.
Oh, Jaws was scary.
Yeah, we went to the beach a lot and I hated to go in the water.
Yeah, it probably traumatized you.
Maybe a little.  Eventually, I started to go into the water.
Did you ever watch it again as an adult?
Yeah, I wasn't as scared.
Did you like it more?
Yeah, I started to realize what a good movie it was.  It was scary, but not enough to make me cry.
You weren't scared going to the beach anymore.
Not really.  I mean, they put up warnings when there are sharks around.
Yeah, and there are shark attacks but not as often as there was on the movie.
Yeah, something like that would make headlines.
Definately.
Now, they make headlines, but usually the victim survives.
Yeah, that's true.
There's really nothing to be scared of.
