Not really
How? He is amazing, He has so many classics.
I like The Carpenters.
Who are they?
A brother and sister band
What is one of their songs?
Top of the World
I have never heard of that song.
It's a classic. They are a great duo.
Did Karen Carpenter sing?
Yes and she was also a drummer.
Did she drum in the band?
I don;t think so, but she did on the television.
Cool. Maybe we could listen to their album if you will listen to a Rod Stewart album.
You got yourself a deal.
