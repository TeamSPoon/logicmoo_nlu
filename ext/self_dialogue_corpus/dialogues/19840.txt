Isn't it sad that Jerry Garcia is no longer alive?
It surely is
Do you know who he is?
I think so.
Have you ever heard of the Grateful Dead?
I have! Is that his band?
It certainly is!
I knew he sounded familiar.
I know that he died many years ago. But I listen to their music all the time.
Do they still tour even though he is no longer alive?
They do! Quite frequently
Do they have other people fill in?
They definitely do. John Mayer even played with them before.
Did you get to see the show?
I sure did. It was great.
What year was that?
2016. I was so happy to see song of those songs live.
Were there a lot of people at the show?
So many people! It was packed!
Cool. So happy you got to experience that show live.
