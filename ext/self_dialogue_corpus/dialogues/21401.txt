So did you see the new Wonder Woman movie yet?
Dude, heck yeah! It was so so good!
I know, I was so glad that DC finally got a good movie!
After Batman vs. Superman I thought that franchise was over, to be honest.
Yeah, they'd just gotten way too dark and gritty. I like that for Batman, but not everyone!
And Wonder Woman's just unapologetically good, I really appreciated that.
I think she and Steve Rogers would get along well.
I thought the same thing! It's too bad they're in different universes.
Well, that, and you can only have so many Steves dying in planes in a world war in one franchise.
Haha, yeah, I thought about that, it's funny how that worked out.
What was your favourite scene?
Well first, the humor was fantastic--like when Diana walked in on Steve?
And she said "what is that" and he thought she meant his... uh, member?
Yes! I about died laughing!
And all of her interactions with the secretary were pretty spot on too.
I agree.
For dramatic scenes, though, I thought that the No Man's Land scene was fantastic.
I loved how she was just like, no, I came here to help people.
Exactly! A very Steve Rogers thing if I do say so myself.
Too true, too true.
