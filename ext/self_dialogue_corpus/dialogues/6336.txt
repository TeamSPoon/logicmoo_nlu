Am I the only person in the world who was not crazy about Aladdin?
Really?  I thought Robin Williams was great as Genie
He was.  I liked Aladdin too, but Jasmine really annoyed me.
Was it her voice?  I like Linda Larkin in everything except Aladdin the movie.
Her voice was a big part.  But I also thought she came on to Aladdin super strong.
I think they were still using that group of artists that really sexualized everything.
The ones who hid the naughty pictures in The Little Mermaid and The Lion King?
Yes.  Don't quote me on it, but I think it was them.
I wonder if they did The Little Mermaid 2 too?  Did you notice Ariel was about to pop out of her top?
I'd forgotten that.  I never bothered to watch The Little Mermaid 3.
