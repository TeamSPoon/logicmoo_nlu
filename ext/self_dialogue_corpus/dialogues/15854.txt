What do you think of the current state of hip hop?
Personally, I think the lyrical content has fallen from public eye.
What do you mean?
Well, aside from people like Kendrick Lamar and J Cole I feel like people don't appreciate lyrics in mainstream hip hop.
I can see what you mean to a certain extent, but I feel that you're exaggerating a bit.
How so?
Well we have people like Schoolboy Q, Big Sean, and Kanye West still out in the mainstream still.
True. I just meant we don't pay enough attention to the content in music.
I think that's still true somewhat.
Yeah like people just pay attention to melodies. They don't care about anything other than if it sounds cool or not.
Yeah, I feel like people pay too much attention to artists like Lil Yachty and Lil Uzi.
Exactly. They pick very catchy beats and throw lazy lyrics over it.
Yeah, but how do we shift back to listening to more lyrically conscious artists?
I don't know. I just think that what the kids are listening to right now isn't hip hop.
We used to shun this type of music back in the day.
Yeah. the previous generations of music paid attention to lyrics.
I guess it's just the current wave of music. it might change in a few years.
And i'll be happy when it does. I don't like seeing hard working artists I listen to struggle while this type of music is in the spotlight.
That's a valid point. I think lyricists deserve to eat more off of hip hop before the art is dead.
I think it'll always be a craft. i just wish it was in the spotlight again.
