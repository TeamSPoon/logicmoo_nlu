Do you listen to modern classical music?
What would you consider modern?
It's basically the latter half of the 20th century to the present.
Do you mean stuff like Phillip Glass?
That's a good example. Phillip Glass is a minimalist.
I like Philip Glass, but I don't know what a minimalist is.
Are you interested in a brief explanation?
I suppose so.
Minimalist composers like Philip Glass and Steven Reich tend to take short musical ideas and patterns and repeat them throughout the piece.
It sounds kind of like house music?
Well, house music can have a simplistic repetitive nature to it, so in that regard it is similar. The overall effect is not like night club music though.
I see. What makes it different than dance music?
The goal of creating a musical composition, if you are a "serious" composer, is to accomplish some type of profound aesthetic that has never been done before.
So it's like creating something important that contributes to advancing the field of music, rather than just pleasing an audience.
That's a good way of summing it up.
What are some minimalist compositions that you would suggest?
I particularly like Koyaanisqatsi by Phillip Glass. It's actually the first of a trio of compositions.
I'm not sure if I've heard that. It's sounds vaguely familiar.
Part of it was used in the film score of the movie "The Watchmen."
That's cool. I liked that movie, although it was kind of weird.
