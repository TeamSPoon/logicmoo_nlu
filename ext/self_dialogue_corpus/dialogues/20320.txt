Have you seen the Martin Lawrence movie Big Mama's House?
No, I haven't but I bet it's good. I love his acting.
It is hilarious. You have got to see it.
I think I will go on Netflix and see if I can find it.
While your there, look up Big Momma's House 2 also.
Oh really, there is more than one?
Yeah, I there are three of them. And they are really funny.
Good. I love a good comedy.
I do too. It always makes me feel better to have a good laugh.
If you like that type of comedies Tyler Perry is great in his Madea movies.
I know. I have seen a couple of his movies. He is really hilarious.
Do you know that he fashioned the Madea character after his grandmother?
No, I didn't know that. That is so sweet. His grandmother must have been a character.
I bet she was.
I love the part in some of the Madea movies where she has to go to court. I laughed until I cried at some of those scenes.
Yes. I can just imagine seeing someone like her come into a court room.
I know. I don't know how the judge could keep a straight face.
I would love to be in the audience listening to it.
Yes. That would be worth going to court for.
I know. Comedy at it's finest.
