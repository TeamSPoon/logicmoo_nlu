Man I miss Kelly's work in the NFL
Kelly? Who's kelly?
Chip Kelly, he was the coach for the Ducks at UO and went on to become the head coach for the Eagles
I remember him, he had a good run for a while, but sort of fell off the radar
He was best known for the up-tempo offense where he didn't worry about the clock, but instead of wearing out the opposing team.
I liked that, it made the games kind of like a constant 2 minute drill with the no huddle.
Yeah, for a while there it looked like he might have had a really dynamic team with eagles with a rush/pass offense
I don't know how long that was going to work, it seemed kind of gimmicky
It was a return to basics and, for a while at least, he had Sproles and Murray on the team, if they'd had a rushing QB who knows
I could see that, but with the inside/oustide threat there any rush QB would have not been that big a threat.
Well, during the offseason at least, they had Tebow as a back-up QB and he wasn't accurate, but so much of the tempo is about pace and not making mistakes
That's what doomed them a lot was Sanchez wasn't really a threat there and he did through a lot of INTs
I know, I like the guy, but he wasn't a rush threat and a great CB made the whole affair irrelevant
Yeah, because you just stop the rush and trust the CB to do the rest.
That's why they did really rock as team though, the Eagles I mean.
Why, the defense? I remember they were pretty physical.
That and an incredible special teams unit. If Kelly had filled in the pieces he needed, i imagine they would have been SB contender
I don't know, maybe but against Seattle or Arizona they would have been beaten with 3 and outs and then just ground to paste by those offenses
I'm not saying they were unbeatable, but if the pass threat had been there you would have only heard Kelly's praises sung.
Hopefully he gets another chance.
