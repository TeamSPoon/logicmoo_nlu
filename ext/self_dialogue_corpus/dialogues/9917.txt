what's the type of music that you listen most often
it's definitely hip hop
is there any reason that you love them?
well, they tend to blend in with the atmosphere very well, especially at my apartment where most people are college students
that totally make sense, they're usually very chill and very american
well, in general, they usually have some very naughty lines about black cultures and girls
so what's your favorite artist in this genre?
to be honest I like all of them, they don't sound that much different
what if you have to choose one?
well Drake it is.
