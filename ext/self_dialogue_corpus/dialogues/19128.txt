Hey, do you know the band Blue October?
I don't think so, the name doesn't sound familiar. What are some of the songs they sing that I might recognize?
Well, a few of their most popular songs are Hate Me and Into the Ocean. Do they sound familiar?
Actually, yes, at least I know Hate Me and I really like that song, didn't realize that was the band that sang it though.
Yes, I know they are an Alternative rock band, but they have several songs that really touch me. Not your typical alternative rock songs.
Really? I think Hate Me is actually a pretty song, but it is definitely alternative rock.
Yes, they released a song in 2013 named Fear and I really find it to be an inspiring song.
Hmm, well, now I want to listen to it for sure! Why do you find it inspiring?
The lyrics encourage you to conquer your fears in life, that if it knocks you down to keep getting back up. It also tells you to turn to God during this time and he will help you.
Well, cool! That isn't the kind of lyrics you usually expect from an alternative rock band, to be perfectly honest.
I know! I was pleasantly surprised with the message when I really listened to the lyrics.
I am definitely going to listen to it when I get home. Any other good ones?
Yes, Home was released in 2016. The album is also named Home.
Okay, what do the lyrics tell you in this one?
Well, this is about the enduring, constant love between husband and wife, children and parents. Basically, the family unit.
Well, sounds pretty, and different. Is it a slower song?
Yes, beautiful melody and I love it. Sends the message of a happy, life-long love.
Oh, so sweet and touching. Do you cry when you hear it?
Every time! I bet you will too.
I am sure I will. I will think of my parents love for one another, and their family.
