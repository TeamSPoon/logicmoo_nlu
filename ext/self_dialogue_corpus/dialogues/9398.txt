Have you been listening to any rap music lately?
Yeah I have been listening to some Young Thug.
He is rather entertaining.
I listen to the song On Fire.
Oh cool. That is from the Beautiful Thugger Girls album right?
That is right.
I have some songs from that album.
Which ones?
She Wanna Party and Daddy's Birthday.
Oh interesting.
