Do you remember Dr Dre?
Who couldn't.
I still remember N.W.A. they revolutionized rap.
They did, everything they did pushed rap into the mainstream and made it more accessible to that generation.
It was a hard time for them they struggled with rights and what was fine and what wasn't.
I still remember the song F the police.
That was very daring for them to pull something off like that.
It was warranted though the police were out of control.
Yes they were.
I wonder what would have happened if they didn't release that song if things would have kept going the way it was.
I also like Still Dre.
He was making a statement that he was still here and not going anywhere.
Also so people wouldn't forget who he was and what he did for the genre.
He is a genius though and not just lyrically he is a very smart individual.
I couldn't agree more, he made something of himself and so many others.
I still remember I need a Doctor.
That was perfect timing for him and Eminem.
Both were struggling if I recall and this bounced both of them back and on top instantly.
Those two combined are unmatched.
I couldn't agree more you just can't top those two in the same song.
