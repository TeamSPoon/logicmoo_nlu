Do you remember the first time you saw the Beatles?
Yeah on the old Ed Sullivan Show.
When Ed Sullivan anounced them all those girls in the audience went crazy.
I didn't know what the big deal was, at the time.
Me neither I had never heard of the Beatles.
They sang She Loves You...Yeah !! Yeah !! Yeah !!!!!
I still didn't get excited over it.
After hearing it played on the radio ten million times it started to sound pretty good to me.
We were in the midst of Beatlemania.
Right...smack dab in the middle of Beatlemania and didn't know we would be part of history.
