Calvin Harris has a really nice voice, actually
i didn't even know he sings. i thought he was just a DJ!
he used to sing his own songs sometimes
really!? did he sing slide?
okay no, that one wasn't him. he used to have this song about wanting all the girls, it was a bop
why did he stop singing?
because he wanted to get famous, probably
sucks that you have to compromise like that
he did sing feel so close, though!
which is his best song anyway
