Do you want to go see a movie this weekend?
Sure that would be cool.
Great!
What movie were you thinking?
I'm not sure, something funny!
Sounds good to me. I'll check what's playing.
Cool
Okay, there's Rough Night, or Guardians of the Galaxy 2. Which do you think.
What is rough night about.
It looks like a female version of the Hangover.
So like a Rauchy Comedy.
Yeah, it's rated R.
Do you know who's in it?
It's got Scarlet Johanssen, Zoe Kravitz, and Jillian Bell.
Hmm, the cast sounds pretty good. What do you think?
Either sounds good to me.
Have you heard anything good about either of them?
I know Guardians of the Galaxy is supposed to be pretty good. I haven't heard about Rough Night much.
Okay. Do you want to go see them both?
Sure, sounds good to me.
