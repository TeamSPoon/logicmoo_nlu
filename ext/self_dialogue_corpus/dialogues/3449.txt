What's your favorite horror movie? Like, absolute favorite.
Absolute favorite? John Carpenter's The Thing.
I love The Thing! I'm a big Exorcist fan myself.
Ooh, that one's good too. I like how a lot of the real tension in the story is about the human characters.
Yeah, the same is true in the The Thing, really.
And they both have amazing practical effects! Though I think The Thing wins there, for obvious reasons.
Yeah, even the part where Regan comes doesn the stairs with her body all messed up does not compare to even the scene with the dog from The Thing.
Oof, that scene with Regan gives me the creeps. I couldn't walk down the stairs at night after seeing that.
For me, it's when her head turns around. The sound effect they used for that scares me so much.
That sound effect is actually made by them folding a leather wallet with stuff inside, I looked it up! Isn't that cool?
