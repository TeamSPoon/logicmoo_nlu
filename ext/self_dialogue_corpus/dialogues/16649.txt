Do you like folk music?
Sometimes, but it really depends on the artist.
Have you ever heard Alison Krauss?
Yes I have and I enjoy her music.
One of my favorite artists is Sarah Jarosz, do you know her music?
Yes, I like her song House of Mercy.
That's a good song and I also really like her song Build Me Up From Bones.
I saw her in a concert last year, she was very good.
Do you like Neko Case?
I haven't heard many of her songs but I like the few that I've heard.
Neko is one of my favorites, the album Fox Confessor Brings the Flood is great.
I don't think I've listened to that album, which tracks would you recommend?
Maybe Sparrow and Star Witness are great songs, you'll really like them.
I'll try to find the album, maybe it's on a streaming service.
Neko Case is also a member of The New Pornographers, have you heard of them?
I don't think I have as their name doesn't sound familiar.
You may have heard their song The Bleeding Heart Show, it was used on TV in a commercial and was very popular.
It's possible that I have heard that one.
The New Pornographers is a band made up of members that have had successful careers as solo artists or as members of other groups.
I think my friend listens to them, I'll have to borrow one of his cd's.
