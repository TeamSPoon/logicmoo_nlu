What music do you like to listen to while you are painting?
I love to listen to Enya. Her music puts me in a very creative space.
It is very pretty. I have heard it used a lot on shows and in movies.
Yes, some of her most popular tunes came from there. My favorite was from Lord of the Rings.
Yes, that was a beautiful peace of music. May it Be is probably my favorite Enya song.
I also love how she sings Silent Night in her native language.
I know that piece. I listen to that year round.
I also like to paint to Taylor Swift especially if I am painting flowers. Her songs inspire me to use bright colors.
I love to dance and exercise to her music. I have all of her tunes loaded on my player.
I do to. Do you have a favorite Taylor Swift tune.
I really like Shake It Off. That music can come in handy.
I hear you. That is a powerful song when you have had a bad day.
No kidding. Just crank it up and run on the treadmill.
I think she is one of the most important musicians of her generation.
I agree. She sings songs you can really connect to.
I think it is impressive she writes so much of her own stuff. I would love to have that much talent at any age.
I have to admit I really loved her song Love Story. I think that was the tune that made me a big fan.
Yes, that was a great tune. She has evolved a lot over the years.
I am hoping she continues to write. I also hope Enya releases something new soon.
I know, it seems like forever since we have had a new Enya tune.
