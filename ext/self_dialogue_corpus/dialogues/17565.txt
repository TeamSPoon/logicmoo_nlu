What did you listen to when you were in high school?
Why do you ask?
I'm just curious. I feel like it's a good window into who people were.
I guess that makes sense. But it could be embarrassing, so I'd need to hear from you first.
I was super into Linkin Park.
That actually makes a lot of sense.
Okay, now you.
I liked EDM a lot.
EDM?
Like, electronica. I wanted things to be big and loud.
See, that doesn't seem at all like you now.
Right? Now I mostly listen to, like, Chamber Pop.
A lot of folksy stuff, I imagine.
A lot of Punch Brothers and Lord Huron.
It's changed a lot for me too.
What do you listen to now?
I really like James Blunt.
That doesn't seem like that much of a change.
It feels like it to me!
I guess I'll have to take your word for it!
