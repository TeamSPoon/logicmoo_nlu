What was the best Mel Brooks movie?
I would probably say Blazing Saddles.
I would go with Young Frankenstein.
That's a very solid choice.
You can't go wrong with either of them really.
I give the edge to Blazing Saddles only because it was a bit more raunchy.
I thought it was an interesting take on race relations for sure.
I don't think I ever saw the sheriff in another movie.
Yeah, that was pretty much his one shining moment.
At least it was memorable for him.
