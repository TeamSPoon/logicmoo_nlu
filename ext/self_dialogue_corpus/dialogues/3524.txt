I miss old horror, like Twilight Zone-style horror.
Have you seen The Similars?
I have not heard of that. Is it similar to The Twilight Zone?
Yes. In fact, the director, Isaac Ezban, was partially inspired by that show.
Cool, what is it about?
It takes place in a bus station during a huge storm, where people trapped inside start changing into...something.
Does it have any famous actors in it?
It is a Spanish-language movie made in Mexico, and I am not sure if the actors are famous in Mexican cinema.
Are there subtitles?
Yes, and the dialogue is paced well so there is a lot of time to read and be creeped out at the same time.
