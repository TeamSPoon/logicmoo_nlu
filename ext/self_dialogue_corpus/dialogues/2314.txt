What do you think are some of the best NFL prizes? I think I have some idea.
Well I know they've used team trophies. This seems to be a good structure.
The one they use right now is the Vince Lombardi, right?
That's correct. He coached the Green Bay Packers to a couple of Super Bowl wins.
A brand new Vince Lombardi Trophy is given to the winning team each year, and they keep permanent control of it.
A little different from the Stanford vs. Cal college football games when they compete for temporary possession of an axe.
Well that's an interesting rivalry.
The Lombardi trophies are created by Tiffany & Co. They're said to be worth between $25,000 to $300,000.
Not bad for just a cup.
A sterling silver cup! Its quite an accomplishment.
Then there are the Super Bowl rings as well. Some players have a few.
The Super Bowl losing teams get rings also. I hear they're not generally worn.
I can understand why.
Mmm hmm, and the conference champions receive trophies too. The NFC receive the George Halas Trophy.
And I know the AFC champs get the Lamar Hunt Trophy.
Right. Plus the winning team players get a conference championship ring
Guess I wouldn't mind that, if I played ball at that level.
With the awards, I watch for the MVP, Rookie of the Year, and the Walter Payton Man of the Year Award.
Those are good ones at the individual level.
They're all good I think. Those are the ones I tend to like.
