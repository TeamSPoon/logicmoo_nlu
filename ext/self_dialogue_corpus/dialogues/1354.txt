There was some controversy over an NFL player's football cards not having an authentic signature.
Which player?
Dak Prescott from the Dallas Cowboys.
What position does he play?
He's a quarterback for the Cowboys.
Were the signatures fake?
No, but they were supposedly stamped by a machine instead of him signing them.
Football cards are big business. That would make some people very angry.
The trading card company said it wasn't his fault becaus he didn't know how the cards were sent.
Did they recall all the cards?
They tried. They stopped deliveries to 110 customers, but 167 were still sent out.
People pay good money for those, so they wuld be upset if they were misled about them.
He is supposed to sign all the replacement cards.
If they straighten it out, I doubt it would hurt business.
Not for him. They still announced they had signed a trading card contract with him for the future.
Merchandise makes a lot of athletes a lot of money.
Especially trading cards, because people think they still retain value and can be sold later.
It depends on the player, but also how well the card is taken care of.
I know what you mean. I knew a guy whose dad left him boxes of cards, and the stupid guy left them in the garage where they got mildew and mice droppings on them.
One man's treasure is another man's junk as they say.
