I'm thinking about buying my sister a movie for her birthday.
That's thoughtful! What kind of movies does she like?
I think her favorite movie of all time is Legally Blond.
That was the one with Reese Witherspoon and Luke Wilson?
Yep, that's the one. They made a sequel or two.
If she liked that movie a lot, you probably want to get her a comedy.
Yeah, that's what I'm thinking.
Maybe something starring Reese Witherspoon?
I'm not sure what other comedies she's been in. She was really good in Walk the Line.
The Johnny Cash biopic? I never saw it.
Oh man, you should totally see it. Joquain Phoenix is great in it!
Do you think your sister would like that movie?
Eh, it's a little gritty for her tastes, I think. Johnny Cash wasn't always a nice guy.
OK, so something lighter, then. What about Election?
What's what?
It was a movie starring Reese Witherspoon and Matthew Broderick. A dark comedy.
It doesn't ring a bell.
Witherspoon is this over-achiever high school student and Broderick is a teacher. It's pretty funny.
Maybe I'll get that one for her, then. Thanks for the recommendation!
No problem, hope she likes it!
