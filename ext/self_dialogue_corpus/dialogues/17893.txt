Alright, what is your personal favorite as far as comedic music goes?
Well, my favorite comedy music artist would have to be Ray Stevens.
Ray Steven? What's his style of music.
Outside some spiritual and serious style songs, he does funny Country music.
Okay, give me a few examples.
Well, there's Erik the Awful, A Viking raider who chases a fleeing group of villagers all over the world.
All right, sounds a little werid, but how about something else.
Well, there's Family Funeral Fight.
Family Funeral Fight, what's that one about?
It's about a deeply divided dysfunctional extended family who turns a funeral for a deceased relative into a knock down drag out brawl.
Okay, sounds like it could be funny. Any more?
Well, there is the Ballad of the Blue Cyclone Parts 1 and 2.
Blue Cyclone? Do I have to ask?
He's a wrestler the protangonist of the song keeps running afoul of and gets his butt kicked.
All right, now we are getting somewhere, any more songs like this one?
Well, Kitty Cat's Revenge is not too dissimilair.
Okay, how does the cat get revenge?
Well, it's a fully clawed and fanged pet ocelot trapped in a drainage pipe, it attacks the volutneer sent in to get it and cause him to distrub a ground bee nest as well.
Ouch, that has to hurt! Sounds like most of these songs a musical slapstick comedy.
Yeah, but there are some more high brow humor. I'll tell you about them later.
