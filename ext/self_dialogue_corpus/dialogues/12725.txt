Have you seen the newest start wars movie?
Was that Rogue One?
I think so, yeah.`
No. I actually have only seen one of the movies.
Which one was that?
I'm not actually sure. But it had those cute little fuzzy animals in it!
Oh! You mean the Ewoks!
Yeah!
I think that was Episode IV, but it might have been Episode III.
I'm not really a huge star wars fan, but I did like that one.
