Have you ever seen Shutter Island?
Yes, I think so, but it has been a while.
I saw it this weekend, it was really good!
Leonardo DiCaprio and Mark Ruffalo play in this movie. It is a thriller for sure.
It is definitely an intense mystery and suspense. A woman goes missing on an island hospital and detectives work to find out what happened.
Yes, it was really good, I found myself pretty shocked in the end, it was a twist ending.
Yes, I couldn't believe Leonardo's character was killed in the end, he never gets off that island.
It takes you through a lot of scenes, you aren't sure what is going on until the end.
Yes, it was a maze of the mind, kept you guessing.
I may watch it again soon.
