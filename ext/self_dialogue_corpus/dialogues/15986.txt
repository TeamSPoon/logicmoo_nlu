Have you listened to Halsey's latest album?
No, I haven't. Actually, I haven't heard of that artist before.
You haven't? She's one of my favorite artists!
What genre is her music in?
It's sort of in the alternative / electropop category.
Oh that sounds nice. What's her latest album?
It's called hopeless fountain kingdom.
I'll have to listen to it, thanks!
You should, it's great. It draws a lot on the concept of star crossed lovers, a la Shakespeare Romeo and Juliet style.
That's really cool. I sure do love my drama.
What's your favorite album so far?
You know what, I really love Paramore's After Laughter.
I've listened to it a little bit. I enjoyed it more than I thought I would.
Why did you think you wouldn't like it?
Well I haven't liked some of their past works. Now that they're more alternative pop than emo, I enjoy it more.
Awesome! What's your favorite song?
I have a couple of favorites, but probably Rose Colored Boy!
I love that one too! Or maybe Fake Happy.
That's one of my favorites too.
Overall it's a great album.
