You know, YouTube is one of the greatest ideas ever.
Why do you say that?
I have spent countless hours searching through the music to find songs I like.  I found hundreds a d put them on playlists.
Can you lizten to them any time?
You have to be connected to the internet.
Can you have it on when you are doing something else online?
Not unless you want to pay for an extra service.
So it would be great to have for doing artwork or cooking.
Yeah.  I find that I clean for longer if I have certain music on, my cleaning playlist!
Ahh. Like what?
Well, some examples are..Mississippi by June Tabor and the Oyztsr Band, Lawyers Guns ad Money by Warren Zevon and Telegraph Road by Steve Earle.
I love Steve Earle.
I fiund just aboht every song I ever loved.  Like anything by the Kinks or Guy Clark!
I never even thought to do that.  Sounds like a great idea.
I have playlists for relaxation or sleepy time, or just old favorites.
Can you find most songs?
There has only been one song that I couldn't find.  It was a song by Guy Clark.
That's all?
Yeah.  I have hundreds and hundreds of songs.
Well, I know what I will be obsessed with this weekend.
