Who do you think is going to win the series between Ottawa Senators and Pittsburgh Penguins?
I don't know but it should be a great series.
Well, Ottawa won the 1st game so they have the advantage
Yeah, but Pittsburgh is a veteran team and I think they have a good chance of winning the series
True, they are veterans, but the Senators seem hungrier this year
You could be right, but it's hard betting against a team that has Sidney Crosby.
Yeah, Crosby is a stud and a game changer.
I think he is the MVP of the league
Yeah, he definitely is up for consideration, but they need more than just Crosby.
I hear you, but I think there whole team is ready
So what are you saying? Do you think the Penguins win this series?
Yeah, I think so.
In home many games?
I think the Penguins win this series in 7 games
So, you got the Penguins in the Stanley Cup Final?
Oh yeah, I really believe that it is their time
You may be right, but I feel good about the Senators. I think they are going to win it all.
Well if they do, drinks on me next time we go out.
Sounds like a great bet! If the penguins win, I'll take you out and do the same
Sweet! Get ready to pay up!
