What type of music do you like?
I like pop, and 80s music.
Pop music is great. Britney Spears is one of my favorite artists.
I like her too! I wish her newer albums were better. The older ones were the best.
Do you like the song she did with Iggy Azalea?
I wasn't a fan. I didn't like the video either.
What other pop artists do you like?
I enjoy Christina Aguilera, Lady Gaga, Ariana Grande.
I love the song Ariana Grande did with Nicki Minaj. "Side to Side".
That's a great song, the music video was awesome, too! Nicki Minaj is so talented.
I also like her song, "The night is still young"
Yes, another great song and music video.
I'm really into Taylor Swift, do you like her?
I do! Not her country songs as much as her pop songs though.
I like them all.
I love that most of her songs are written about her personal experiences.
That is awesome. She connects better with the fans that way.
I'm glad she ventured over into pop music. I think she's a great singer.
She really is. I like Carrie Underwood too.
I'm not a big country music fan, but I like some of her songs.
