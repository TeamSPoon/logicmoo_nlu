What is your favorite movie from the nineties?
A goofy movie.
Wow that was a quick answer.
Well yea, it's amazing.
Yea I actually can't believe how many people have seen it.
I think it's getting a big cult following, which makes sense because it's amazing.
Yea. I wanted to go to the possum show when I was a kid. I was heartbroken when my parents told me it wasn't real.
Haha I wanted to buy a power line cd.
Oh man I loved the Powerline songs in that movie.
Yea they were so catchy! I loved goofy's fishing dance at the end too.
