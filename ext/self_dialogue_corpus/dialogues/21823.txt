Did you see the new Kong movie?
Skull Island? Yea, I loved that one.
Me too! It was so much better than the other Kong movies that have come out.
I agree, what did you like about it?
All the monsters, did you see how big they were?
Yea that was pretty cool. That was my favorite part too.
Are they making a sequel?
I hope so, I heard they were.
I hope so too, what do you think they will do?
Hopefully more monsters hahaha!
Yea, well with the new Godzilla movies coming out, do you think they will do another Kong vs Godzilla?
Ooh I hope so, I bet that would be really cool!
Me too! Who would direct it though?
Whoever did Kong:Skull Island.
Why not Godzilla's director.
Kong was a much better movie that's why.
I agree, I liked how they made Kong almost human in this one.
Yea, it was nice to see some compassion out of him.
Too bad Samuel L Jacksons character died, I love him.
I think in the movie he kind of had to.
