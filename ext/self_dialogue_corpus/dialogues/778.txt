I certainly miss the old coach post game meltdowns.
Definitely. They made for good entertainment. Seems like a coach hasn't melted down for a while.
You're right. The last big one was the Dennis Green meltdown and that was nearly a decade ago.
The Bears are who we thought they were. Oh, that was grand.
It definitely was. Sorry to see Dennis Green pass away. Guy was really a good guy who will always be remembered by that meltdown.
Yes, unfortunate. He seemed like a good man.
Nobody was better than Jim Mora.
Jim Mora was the king of the meltdown. I miss him.
Coaches don't have diddly poo on Jim Mora in terms of postgame interviews.
They definitely don't. Everyone always think the Playoff one was the best, but I'm more of a diddly poo fan.
The guy ripped his players, coaching staff, and threw everyone including himself under the bus in that rant.
He said, "we sucked". You never hear a coach say that.
Guy was definitely honest. He was a good coach and will always be overshadowed by his rants.
Good to be remembered by something, I guess.
Not as brutally honest as that coach for the Buccaneers back in the 1970's.
Who was that?
John McKay. A reporter asked about his teams execution and he said he was all for it.
Oh, no way. That's crazy and hilarious at the time.
The Buccaneers were historically bad back in the 1970's.
They were bad.
