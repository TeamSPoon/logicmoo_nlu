Did you see the Golden State Warriors game on Saturday?
Yeah, they are looking tough.
I don't think they can be stopped this year.
The Cavs will give them trouble in the finals.
I don't think so. They're too good.
That's what everyone said last year.
Cavs got lucky last year. Steph Curry was hurt and Draymond Green was suspended.
Those are just excuses.
Besides, they added a certain player named Kevin Durant this year...KD
It's messed up their rhythm
Did you see the game on Saturday? He had 29 points.
Yeah, and Steph only had 16 and Klay only had 6.
Yeah, and they won by double digits! That's my point.
They aren't playing Lebron and the Cavs though
I don't care who they play. No team can stop Klay Thompson, Steph, and KD on the same team.
If anyone can, it's Lebron.
We'll see.
We will see. I think the Cavs will do it. Don't ever bet against Lebron
No one will beat Golden State this year.
The cavs will
