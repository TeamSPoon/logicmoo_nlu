Whats your favorite scary movie?
Whats that one with the doll that kills people?
Oh you mean Chucky?
Yeah! The newest movie came out not too long ago, I really liked that one.
Cool I'll check it out. Is it as funny as Bride of Chucky?
It's a lot more scarier than Bride of Chucky
Is it like the older movies in the series
Yeah, they really went back to their roots and turned up the scare factor
Is it better than the older movies?
I wouldn't say better, but it's just as fun
