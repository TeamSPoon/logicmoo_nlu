What do you think about Garth Brooks?
I guess he is interesting, although I haven't heard much from him.
I was listening to that album he did as another guy.
He really did that?       That's quite cool.
Yes, he called himself Chris Gaines.
Was there anything unique about this fictional character.
Well, he was a rock guy instead of a country singer.
Wow.    So, no hat or anything.
No, he had makeup people and even did a whole fake life story.
How did he put it out to the public?
There was a Behind the Scenes Music Special and everything.
Did it look good?
It certainly felt realistic, although if I didn't know, I'm not sure I would've believed it.
I understand.         How did the music sound?
Good enough.    Some of it felt authentic, some he tried too hard.
I understand.     Didn't he also try and play baseball?
Yes, I remember him doing that right around 2000.
Must be nice to be a music superstar!    When did he do the Gaines album?
I think it was 1999.     About the same time.
Maybe Garth was just starting to feel his age
