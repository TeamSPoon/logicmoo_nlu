What are you doing tonight?
I think I will try to find a good movie to watch. Any suggestions?
Have you ever seen the movie Sleepers?
No, never heard of it Who's in that?
Robert Dinero and Kevin Bacon.
What's it about? Is it any good?
It's about these three kids in New York. They get sent to a boy's home.
Okay, and?
While in the boy's home, they get abused and molested.
Naw, not one of those type movies.
No dude. It's about when they get out and are grown up and they get their revenge.
It sounds like it might be interesting.
It tells a dark story but then the payback is the whole kicker.
Why they call it Sleepers?
Because the way it goes down, somebody plotting and just waiting for their chance at revenge, a sleeper.
It sounds like it might be worth a view.
I liked it. Liked it so much that I have the dvd.
Well shoot, I don't have to rent anything.
Why you say that?
Just bring it over and we can watch it together.
