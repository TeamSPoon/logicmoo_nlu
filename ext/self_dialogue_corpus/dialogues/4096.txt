Have you seen the 2000 thriller American Psycho will Christian Bale?
Yes, I actually really like that movie and find it quite entertaining.
It is a pretty amusing movie and I really thought the young Bale at that time did a great job.
Not only is it a thriller, there is also a fair amount of dark comedy.
Yes, that is also true. Especially the scene with Paul Allen, that is probably the most famous part of the movie.
Not only that, but the Patrick character was also very interesting.
That begs the question that has never been answered --- was it all in his head?
I have heard that rumor, but also read statements that while most of it in fact was in his head, not all of it.
That's another strong aspect of the movie. Letting the audience decide what really happened.
I agree. It's always good, because he we are almost twenty years later still talking about it!
