Why didn't the patriots run the ball
not to smart
They would have one that super bowl
Yes they would have
Patriots would have never stopped lynch
No they wouldn't have
He was a train
I mean you have a running back they couldn't stop
And you pass the ball
over the middle no less
right
at least throw it to the outside
or drop back and pass it
dont throw it over the MIDDLE
would have loved to see the look on the players faces when they got the play call
lynch would have been like "huh"
"are you serious"
i would have been cracking up
yeah me tooi
would have been priceless
