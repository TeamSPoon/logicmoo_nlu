Do you listen to Justin Timberlake a lot?
Not a lot, but when he puts something out I do.
Yeah, it sucks that he never puts out music anymore.
I think the last full length thing he put out was the 20/20 experience.
He must be a perfectionist.  He takes forever, but it's all so perfect.
Well, I don't love everything he does right when he does it.  But later I go back and listen and it's awesome.
Yeah, it's like he's a few years ahead of his time.
At least he drops a few singles every now and then.
Yeah, like that song from Trolls.
Right.  Who else could make a kids' song so cool?
