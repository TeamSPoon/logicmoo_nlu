Do you like any particular instrumental guitar groups?
I like Joe Satriani a good bit.
Me too, he's a very good guitarist.
My dad says he's one of the best.
Didn't he also train Steve Vai and a couple other really famous guys?
Yeah I know he trained Steve Vai, and I think Eric Johnson also.
Wow, that's pretty impressive.
What's your favorite album by him?
I like the whole Surfing with the Alien album.
That one is pretty much essential.
What do you think of his playing style?
I like that he plays a lot of melodic stuff, but still knows how to be very technical and quick.
I think that's pretty accurate. I like how he structures all his songs.
I like that too, they're very easy to follow but also keep you on your toes.
Sometimes I feel like you never know what weird sounds will come on next in some of his songs.
I think some songs are definitely like that.
Have you ever seen one of his concerts live?
No, but I would love to.
He usually has a lot of famous guest performers with him too.
That's pretty cool, I'll have to look up some of those performances up then.
