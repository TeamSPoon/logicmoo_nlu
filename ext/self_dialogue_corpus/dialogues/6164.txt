Okay, best Disney movies of the 2000s.
Wow you're going for the big questions! Okay best Disney movies .... I mean honestly Holes was one of the greatest movies, period.
Wow you really are my soulmate! I loved Holes, I still know all the words from that song at the end.
Of course! Okay well what were some of your favorites?
Well, the Lizzie McGuire movie, hands down. It's what made me want to go to Rome!
That's a really good one too. I had it on VHS. I'm still upset they didn't put Miranda in the movie!
Right! It was a dishonor to the original trio. And personally I was mad Lizzie and Gordo got together.
Can't say the same, I had been rooting for them since the TV show.
You know who I was rooting for? Ethan Kraft.
Ethan Kraft, the typical teenage hearthrob! I really do miss those movies.
