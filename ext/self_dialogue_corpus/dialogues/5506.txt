Hey, I like your dog! Is that a dalmation?
It is, yes. We had to get one after our kids watched 101 Dalmatians.
Oh my gosh, I loved that movie when I was a kid. I even read the book over and over.
It was the first book our son Jacob read. He wanted to read my copy after he watched the movie.
Whenever I see a dalmatian, I think of firefighters and Disney movies.
Yeah, my wife named him Pongo - just like in the movie.
Just as long as their is no Cruella de Vil around!
Did you see the live action movie with Glenn Close a few years ago?
I did! And don't forget 102 Dalmatians!
Hmmmm...I may pick up some popcorn so our family can watch a Disney double feature tonight!
