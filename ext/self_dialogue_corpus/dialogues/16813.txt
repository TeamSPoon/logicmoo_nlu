Who do you like for female music?
I love country music
Me too. I really like Shania twain
Shes such a classic, I like her and the newer ones
Like Carrie underwood?
Yes, I love carrie, and Miranda lambert
Miranda lambert is so edgy, I love her
I really like her songs gunpowder and lead and kerosene kerosene is my break up anthem
Mine too, I also like Shania man I feel like a woman.
Yea I love all Shania songs. I still have her cd
Me too, I listen to it in the car all the time.
I also still have the backstreet boys cd
I still have nsyncs
Boy bands never get old. I still wish they made music
Me too. I just say last night they are coming out with a boy band show.
That's so cool, they need boy bands again
They really do, I don't know if they will be as good as the old ones.
Probably not.
Did you hear that song that has the backstreet boys in it?
Yes I love it
