The Usual Suspects probably has the best twist ending ever.
Ah yes, Keyser Soze.
It was pretty interesting to watch the story unfold.
I missed all the hints in that movie.
The cool thing is if you rewatch it, you'll catch nearly everything.
I've heard that, but haven't followed up on it.
It was kind of the movie that launched Bryan Singer's career too.
It was a good piece of filmmaking.
Give a lot of credit to the script.
Yep, awesome writing throughout.
