I have to write a paper on motion picture history for my class.
Have you chosen what movie you will pick to discuss?
I need some suggestions.
I took a similar class, there are a few movies that always kept coming up in the class.
What movies were those.
There is one called 12 Angry Men.
I have never heard of it.
It is usually the gate way film for many getting into film.
Are there any that may be more well known?
I think CaddyShack is actually a good one.
That is the one with Bill Murray right?
Yes, even in college it is known as a bit of a master piece.
I thought it was very funny.
It was one of the first really irrelevant movies to hit it so big.
I loved the comedy in that.
The use of the beaver was one of my favorite parts.
I do not think they are really looking for a comedy, is there another one?
A newer one might be Fargo.
Is that the film the tv series is based on?
It is, it is so dark and very funny, but not exactly a comedy.
