What do you think of Snoop Dogg?
I think he's a classic rapper and a good one.
What's your favorite song of his?
One of my favorites has to be Gin and Juice.
I remember listening to that song while at parties.
Also hearing people blare it on their car stereos too.
When that song first came out it blew up and became an instant classic.
Yes it did.
My favorite has to be Lodi Dodi.
I forgot all about that one.
I like it because it's catchy and a little odd for him.
All valid reasons it is rather unique.
Also the beat and rhythm of the song is top notch.
I enjoyed the rhythm the most.
Did you like doggy dog world?
Yes it's one of my top songs of his.
I enjoyed that one a lot growing up.
I also liked peaches and cream.
That is another classic.
He's just a great musician.
