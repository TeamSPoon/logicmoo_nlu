Hey Bill?
Yes Dad?
Hold your popcorn...  You know my dad used to take me to the game all the time when I was your age?
Wow were you a Dodgers fan too?
I was a fan of the ballpark how it smelled, fresh dodger dog..the smell of peanuts..just so exciting.
I'm having a great time dad.
And just when I was your age was when the miracle happened...I caught my very first fly ball.
Wow all by yourself?
Yeah...with that same glove I gave you. (looks down at the glove he gave to billy last year for t-ball).
Wow  I'm hoping that some day happens to me.
It was kind of strange thinking back on it though...  after I got that fly ball I felt like part of the reason I came to the ballpark was complete.
Oh?
Yeah it was like my dad built it up so much that I felt like there would never be topping that day no matter how many times we went, so we quit going.
Here dad have some of my popcorn *both smile*
Announcer *Next up to batter up is Holiday*
Wow look dad he's up!
Wow look son its coming right for us!
Billy catches the ball*  Wow dad I.... *looks over at his dad then drops it on the ground as another little girl near him gobbles it up*
*Dad smiles*  Aww son...oh well there will always be a next time!
Yeah dad, guess we'll have to just keep coming back til I finally get one.
