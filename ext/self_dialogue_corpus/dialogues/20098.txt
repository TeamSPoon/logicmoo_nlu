Have you seen Guardians of the Galaxy 2?
No, I never saw the first one, and I want to see it before I see the second one.
You're going to love it! It's about this guy who calls himself Starlord.
Don't tell me anything about it, I don't want it ruined.
Ok. It's an awesome movie. you're going to love the retro soundtrack.
Really, I don't want to know anything before I see it.
Ok. I couldn't believe how good Bradley Cooper did playing Rocket Raccoon, a genetically engineered animal that doesn't know what a raccoon is, and he can talk and has this serious attitude problem and is always shooting up things.
I really wish you wouldn't tell me anything more.
Sure, I understand. But I will tell you that at the end of the movie, you find out the awesome soundtrack really had a special significance/
Really, don't tell me any more spoilers.
That's not a spoiler. I hope you get to see it soon. Just make sure you watch through all the credits because you know how Marvel loves to sneak in scenes after you think the movie is over.
You're really not going to stop until you've ruined this for me, are you?
I'm not ruining anything. These are just minor points. Like the fact that the big talking tree character, Groot, can only say: I am Groot. Well, at least that's the way it is until the end of the movie. But I won't tell you what happens.
I really hate you sometimes.
Don't forget that Marvel loves putting Stan Lee in their movies in a little cameo part! Be on the lookout for Stan!
I need to get a new group of friends.
I'm not telling you anything major. LIke I haven't told you anything about the romantic tension between Starlord and Gamora and whether it works out or not.
I'm leaving. I'm going home.
Ok. Just let me know when you see it. Because the ending perfectly sets up what happens in Guardians of the Galaxy 2.
I hope  I never see you again.
