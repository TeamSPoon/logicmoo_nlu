Do you enjoy older films?
Yes  I do. I really like Kim Novak.
what do you recommend of hers?
Bell book and candle.
I think I saw that actually.
she plays a witch in it.
Yes and she learns to love.. right?
Yep. I absolutely adore her in this one.
she was well cast in this role.
It was actually a play first.
I wonder if they had alive cat in the play?
I don't know, maybe... I do know the cat in the film was hers in real life.
That is neat.
It makes sense since they need to have a good trust with the animal.
True. Did you ever see green mansions?
The one with audrey hepburn?
Yes and the actor from psycho.
Yes , I enjoyed it but not as much as roman holiday.
Well I mention it because the deer in the movie actually became her pet in real life.
Oh that is cool. Kim and audrey both starred with their pets, I like that.
