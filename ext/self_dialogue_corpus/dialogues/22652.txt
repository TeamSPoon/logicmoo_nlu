Have you ever seen the movie Black Water?
No, I've never heard of it. What's it about?
It's about a giant killer crocodile.
Oh, one of those movies. No, I think those movies are boring.
Not this one! Two women get stuck out in the middle of a swamp and their boat is just a few feet away from them, but they can't get to it.
So what do they do?
Well, they try to come up with different ways of getting to the boat, but every time they try, the crocodile shows up again.
Man, that sounds really cheesy.
I guess it is, but it still does a great job of capturing the fear.
The fear of getting eaten by a crocodile?
Well that yes, but mostly that fear of the unknown.
What's unknown, they know what the crocodile is going to do.
Yea but they can't see the crocodile. They don't even know if it's still there.
So what? They still know it's a crocodile.
Yea, but for all they know, the crocodile left a long time, and they are just staying up there for no reason.
Oh I see what you mean. They might be starving themselves just out of fear.
Right, the fear of the unknown.
Gotcha. That is kind of cool.
See? It's not a bad movie, you should check it out.
Maybe I will.
