why is pac so beloved?
he had passion
yeah, he meant everything he ever said
and he had emotional songs like dear mama
but also a lot of thug songs
he was just a complex individual
he was everything all at once
an activist, a thug, a gangsta, a poet, a actor, a sensitive guy
he is so perplexing
he is about as confusing as kanye
those are the two most outspoken rappers ever
well, the two most important outspoken rappers ever
i wonder how pac would feel about kanye
he probably would have liked kanye
maybe pac would wear yeezys
i dont know about that
pac is older than kanye right
yeah but not that much actually
pac is like jayz age
yea
