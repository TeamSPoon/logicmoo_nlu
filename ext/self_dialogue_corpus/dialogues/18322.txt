I'm bored. Let's go see a show.
That sounds fun! Any idea who's playing a show in town tonight?
I think I heard K. Flay is doing a set at a bar downtown.
I've never heard of K. Flay. Who is that?
She's a rapper. She's pretty great.
That sounds cool. Does she have any songs I would have heard?
I kind of doubt it. She's pretty indie.
I'm excited to check out something new then.
Yeah, I think you'll really like her. She makes most of her own beats, too.
That's so cool! I'm always on the lookout for more lady musicians in hip hop.
There are some really great ones if you know where to look.
I agree. Women don't get enough credit in art and music.
Too true. I've been on a kick lately where I'm only listening to female artists.
What a good idea! Can you recommend any more to me?
Of course! Have you listened to Nova Rockafeller yet?
I haven't. Tell me more?
She's another awesome indie rapper that I think would be right up your alley.
That's great. Does she remind you of anyone else I'd know?
Not really, to be honest. I thought of her because I think she and K. Flay have a similar style, actually.
Oh, I see. I guess I'll really have to pay attention at the show tonight.
