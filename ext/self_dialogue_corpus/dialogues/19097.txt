Who's your favorite soul singer or band?
Hm, I think it would have to be Otis Redding.
Yeah he's amazing. What's your favorite album of his?
Blue. I listened to it a lot growing up.
I've watched some of his live stuff at Monterey on youtube. He was amazing live, I bet.
Yeah, I've watched those videos too. Did you know Aretha Franklin covered one of his songs?
No, which song?
R-E-S-P-E-C-T
Respect? Wow I had no idea.
Yeah Aretha made it about women, but it really was not about that originally. Do you like Aretha?
Yes! I grew up listening to her.
Who is your favorite soul singer or band?
I'm a huge Erykah Badu fan, but she hasn't done much recently and I don't listen to her all that much any more.
Yeah I havent heard anything from her recently. How about John Legend?
He's okay. I've been listening to more bluesy rock stuff, like Alabama Shakes.
They are really good.
Yeah, I'd love to go see them live. Have you seen any live shows recently?
Yeah, I went to Coachella. I follow this band based in LA called Chicano Batman.
Oh I just listened to them -- they are amazing! Who else did you see at Coachella?
Radiohead, even with all the sound problems.
