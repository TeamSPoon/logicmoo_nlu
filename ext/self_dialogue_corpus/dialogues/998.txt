I just saw Superbowl XXXVI on replay last night.
The first time the Pats one?
Yes, first time.
They were in it twice before, right?
Yes, Superbowl XX and XXXI, both losses.
To Chicago and Green Bay.
Blown out 46-10 in XX.
Different in XXXVI.
I thought they were going to get blown out by the Rams.
The Greatest Show on Turf.
The score was close, luckily.
3-0 in the first quarter.
14-3 Pats by the half.
Due to an interception and a fumble.
17-3 by the end of the third quarter.
I thought the Pats had a chance then.
It would have been 23-3 after a fumble to the Pats, but it was called back.
Then the Rams tied it.
Leading to the great last second Vinateri field goal.
And Brady became the M.V.P.
