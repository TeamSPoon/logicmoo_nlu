Can you recommend any good action movies for us?
You mean a new one or old?
Doesn't matter.
Have you seen the movie Hitman?
I don't think so. Who's in it?
Timothy Olyphant is the main actor.
No, never watched it. Is it new?
No. Actually it's from 2007.
Is there a lot of action?
Sure is. He is a great actor too.
