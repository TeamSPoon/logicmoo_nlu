Have you been following the NBA playoffs?
Yes.  It's been a competitive playoffs
Do you think anybody can beat the Cavaliers in the East?
Probably not.  Lebron James is playing awesome.
What about the Warriors in the West?  Can anybody beat them?
Probably not.  I think we are going to see a Warriors vs Cavaliers rematch in the finals.
I agree.  Who wins?
I like the Warriors to win it all
They are stronger with the addition of Kevin Durant, but I like the Cavaliers to repeat.
No way.  The Warriors are playing at another level.
They live and die with the 3 point shot, just like last year.
Maybe so.  Unlike last year they have more weapons.
They do have more weapons, but they aren't playing as united as the Cavaliers
Player for player the Warriors are better.
No way,  I see it 3-2 Warriors at best.  I'll give you Kevin Durant, Steph Curry and Draymond Green
I see it 4-1.  The 1 being Lebron James.
That's big 1.  Best player in the world.
Basketball is a team game
Just like last year, Lebron James will elevate his team.
I guess we will see.  Care to make a friendly wager?
