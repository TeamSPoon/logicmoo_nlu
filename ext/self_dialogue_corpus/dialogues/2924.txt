I feel like there are so many people in the NFL who need to retire.
Really, what is the cutoff age again?
I don't think there's an official cut off age, but so many players are pushing 40.
40 year olds still got it, though.
Yeah, but you know that over time they just lose stamina and agility and such.
What is the youngest you can be in the NFL, again?
Probably 18, I really doubt 18 year olds get drafted though.
There's probably really young players on teams.
Yeah, but they don't play much I assume.
I wonder how the oldest player in the NFL is.
I don't know if he's officially retired yet, but Bret Farve was definetely the oldest for a while.
Yes, I remember him! A defense, right?
I thought he was a quaterback.
Either way, you are right in that he is older now.
Yeah, I know for a fact he is over 40.
He must have been in the NFL forever.
Yep, good player though.
Eventually your time is up though.
Yeah, like I said it's time for him to stop.
They all retire eventually.
