Do you remember the forest chase scene in Return of the Jedi?
The one where they're riding the speeders?
Yes, that's the one.
Yeah man, that was like the coolest scene when I was a kid.
Yeah, it was Luke and Leia riding together right?
Right, and then Luke jumps onto his own speeder
But then he eventually falls off
Well jumps off, yes
And then takes out his green lightsaber
And chops off the front part of the speeder which causes him to crash.
