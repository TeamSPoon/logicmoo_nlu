Do you like opera?
No, not really, I find it to be insufferable?
Why it is such a skilled art form? The use of ones vocal chords in such a way is fascinating to me.
Well I understand that lots of practice and skill is involved in the opera but I just don't find it that appealing, maybe if I understood itailian.
Well that is another part that I find to be so wonderful about the Opera it is where the two worlds of music and performing theater combine to create something substantial.
I just don't like it, my music taste is more centered on pop and what's current.
Okay well what is one of your favorite groups?
I really like Lady Gaga, and bands like Zedd but have a soft spot for metal.
So you are a Metallica  fan, but I ask that because it's just the first to pop into my head.
Well yeah I do like them but have such love for Pantera or System of a Down.
Sounds like some angry music to me.
I agree it sounds angry but it's really just about expression of emotions that so many try to avoid.
So looking at a completely different genre, are you familiar with Louis Armstrong?
No, but I have herd that name.
He is a famous Jazz trumpetter from New Orleans during the time when the foundation of jazz was being built
And when was that?
It was during his life between 1901 and 1971.
What songs would I know of his?
Maybe that's for me, it is one of those that has his famous trumpet solo.
The music of Jazz is so comforting and relaxing.
