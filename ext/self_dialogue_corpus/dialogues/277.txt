Do you have a favorite superhero movie?
I love superman
That one was good but i prefer spiderman more
I hate spodees, thats always turned me off of spiderman
I can understand that
But superman is so cool
He does have a lot of cool powers
Exactly and i love the storyline too
I agree, but soiderman will always be my favorite
They are okay.
