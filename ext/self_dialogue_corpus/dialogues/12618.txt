Did you see the most recent Star Wars Movie?
Oh, Rogue One?
What? No. The Force Awakens.
Did you not see the Rogue One?
No. When did that come out?
Last year. It was awesome.
Wait. Was it the sequel to The Force Awakens?
No... it is kind of weird I guess. It's just a story that takes place in the same universe.
So it has nothing to do with Rey, or Poe from the Force Awakens?
Nope. That sequel comes out next year on December 15th.
