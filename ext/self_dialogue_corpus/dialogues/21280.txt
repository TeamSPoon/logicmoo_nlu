Have you ever seen The Godfather?
No, I need to watch that.
You really do! It's a must see classic!
Who is in it?
Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Robert DeNiro
Some of my favorite actors.
The story is fantastic and really riveting.
We should watch it together.
I would love to!
They play it pretty frequently on TV - maybe we could catch it.
I have it on DVD!
Even better, we'll watch yours.
The first two are great, the third one, meh.
Well, we'll start with the first two then!
Yes, you're going to love them.
Maybe it will even inspire us to learn Italian.
Definitely, that movie make you want to be Italian.
Or at least eat some Italian food.
Can't wait to watch it with you! You're gonna love it!.
I'm sure I will!
