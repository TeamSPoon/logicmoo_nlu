Who is the best quarterback?
I like Aaron Rodgers the most.
Really? You don't like Brady?
I like him but Rodgers is more fun to watch.
What do you mean?
He's more athletic and has a stronger arm.
The Patriots have won more than the Packers.
Football has offense and defense and the Patriots are better all around.
The Packers have the better Quarterback.
Did you see his throw in the playoffs?
The throw against the Cardinals?
Yeah, he threw the ball fifty yards.
That was the final play in regulation.
There was so much pressure on that play.
If he messed up the game was over.
The Packers ended up losing anyway.
I know but the throw was so memorable.
Rodgers kept his team alive.
The Packers always have a chance with Rodgers.
The Quarterback is so important in the NFL.
