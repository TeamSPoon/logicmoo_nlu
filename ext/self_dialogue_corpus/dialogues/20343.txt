What is your favorite Brad Pitt movie?
I like most of them. He is one of the best actors in the world.
I agree, I really believe he is the person he is playing.
I know, I thought he was amazing in Benjamin Button.
Oh yeah, that was a great movie. Wouldn't it be weird if that really happened to someone.
I'll tell you, I learned a real life lesson from that one.
What was it something like always be kind?
No, it was no matter if you start of as a baby or an elderly, someone will have to take care of you in the end.
Ha, ha, I hope that's not really true. Did you freak out when you saw this old baby.
Yes, that was a really ugly baby. Who said, "all babies are cute"?
That one wasn't for sure. He did make me feel like there was this child in an old man's body.
Did you love his adopted mother or what? She had a heart of gold.
Yes, she was wonderful and her husband was too.
It was so cool that he finds this friend to play with and then she becomes the love of his life.
I know, it broke my heart when they had to leave each other.
I was nice that his father re-enters his life and get to know him.
Then he leaves him his factory, house, and all of his money.
I love that Benjamin sold everything and left it to her.
I love that she took care of him when he became a baby until he died.
It was such a good love story.
