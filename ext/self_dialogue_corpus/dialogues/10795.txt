Did you see the first Fast and the Furious movie?
Yes. It is such a good movie!
I think I saw it eight times.
I probably saw it 12 times!  I love Paul Walker
Me too!  But I think I like Vin Diesel better.
He is in great shape!
When I listen to the sound track, I automatically drive faster.
Now I want to go watch the movie.
I have the DVD!
Oh, let's go watch it now!
