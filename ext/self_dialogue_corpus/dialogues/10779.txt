Why are the Fast and Furious movies shown out of order?
I think because after #3 - Tokyo Drift - they did not think the franchise would come back.
Why, because Vin Diesl was off staring in Triple X movies?
Yes and because for the second movie, Paul Walker couldn't really carry it alone.
Paul Walker wasn't in the Fast 8 movie was he?
No, he died during the filming of Fast and Furious 7 so they just did not include him or Jordanna Brewster, who plays Mia.
Is Fast 8 just as good as the rest?
I think so, it has a good storyline, but I honestly think they should have stopped after Fast and Furious 7.
Do you think they will go all the way to 10?
Hard to say, but I think all the stars would definitely do it becaus the Fast and Furious franchise still makes a lot of money worldwide.
