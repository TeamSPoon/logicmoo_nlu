I don't know what movie I wanna watch today.
What movie haven't you seen?
There in lies the problem; I've seen almost al of them.
I thought you wanted to watch the underworld series again?
Oh yeah, Kate Beckinsale is always a good bet.
Well there you go, crisis averted.
Come on, it's never easy picking out a movie when you seen as many as I have.
Then maybe you should try reading a book every now and then.
That's not fair I read occasionally.
Other than the back of the dvd case?
Yes smarty pants; sometimes I read the book the movie is based on.
You have serious issues.
Oh like you're any better? How many times have you seen the Underworld series?
I hardly see how that's relevant.
Avoiding the question are we? seriously how many?
20.
And yet, you say I watch too many movies?
YOU do, I just like watch vampires taking out werewolves; perfectly natural.
Yeah, Vampiric death dealers with lots of cool toys, not a bad way to spend an afternoon.
So are we gonna watch it or what?
