Go Browns!
Wow, a Browns fan!
There are a few of us left!
I'm a Bills man myself.
Anyone but Patriots is all right with me.
Well you'll get no argument from me.
Hoping they lose at Denver this season.
Hear, hear.
You nervous about your first timer?
McDermott? Nah, he'll do fine.
Win early and you might have a shot this year!
Wish I could say the same for you...
Hey, this is gonna be our year!
I don't know-- think you can top Christmas Eve?
Two Christmas Eves this year!
I mean you got Peppers, good job there
And our offense is tight.
Hey, you gotta believe, right?
Woof woof!
Back atcha.
