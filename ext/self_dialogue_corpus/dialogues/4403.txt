Is No Country For Old Men a good movie?
Depends on who you ask.
You've seen it haven't you? Did you like it? I've never seen it before.
I thought it started off strong, but fell apart close to the end.
How so?
Let's just say, the main guy makes a bad decision that totally ruins the flow of the story in my opinion.
The guy who finds the money or the bad guy that Javier Bardem plays?
The guy who finds the money.
I might check it out anyway. How's Tommy Lee Jones' performance?
Forgettable.
