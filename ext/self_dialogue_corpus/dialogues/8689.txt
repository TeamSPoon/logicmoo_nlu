What's your favorite genre of rock music?
I think Rock & Roll would be it.
You mean from the 50s and 60s?
50s, 60s and 70s. They made some super sweet music back then.
Yeah you're right they did. What were some of your favorite artists?
Elvis Presley, The Beatles and Creedence Clearwater Revival rocked!
Those are great choices. Mine are Janis Joplin, Jimmy Hendrix and The Rolling Stones.
They all rocked! Too bad most of them are no longer around.
Yeah, it would be great to hear new music from any of them.
At least we still have The Stones around.
