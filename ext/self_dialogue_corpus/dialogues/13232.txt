What did you think of Christensen as Aniken?
He was alright.
I didn't really think to much of him.
It was cool that he insited on wearing the Vader suit in Episode III.
Yeah, gotta give him props for that.
They had to have him wear stilts.
That must have been uncomfortable.
I love that last battle with Obi-Wan.
Probably the best duel in the franchise.
Second maybe Yoda Sidious.
