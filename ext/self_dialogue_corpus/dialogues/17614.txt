I was listening to an old Green Day CD I found the other day.
Oh wow which one was it?
It was American Idiot. I used to listen to it all the time.
Oh so did I. I loved some of the longer ballads on that CD.
I love how it kind of tells this story about a boy leaving home and then coming back.
Ya I still like Holiday.
I think the one I still sing the most is Whats-Her-Name.
Ya that's a good one too. I kind of like the story of Saint Jimmy.
What other Green Day songs do you like?
I liked 21 Guns a lot. I thought the rhythm and guitar were great.
Oh ya and some really awesome lyrics too.
You can't fogret Time of Your Life though.
Oh ya that one is so over played but it's still a good song.
Ya exactly if It wasn't played at every event I think it would be better.
I really like the acoustic guitar in that song.
I also still love Basket Case.
I liked the whole album that song came from.
Ya I don't remeber a lot from that album but I think that one is my favorite.
Ya the lyrics are really funny.
I think that song may be there first hit.
