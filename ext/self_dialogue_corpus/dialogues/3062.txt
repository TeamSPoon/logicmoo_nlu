You ready for the upcoming NFL season?
Sure am, what do you think the Colts will do this year?
I hate to say it, but I think they'll be pretty bad.
I agree, it all depends on Andrew Luck though. He needs to carry this team.
Carry this team is right, they're awful if he's not playing well.
Yeah I agree, the Colts front office has really let Andrew down.
Yeah that cupboard is bare.
No help in the offseason for Hilton.
Nope none, plus they have a running back in Frank Gore who could be in AARP soon.
Yeah very little planning ahead by them.
I hate that Chuck Pagano is still coach too.  He is terrible.
Oh man, remember that fake punt play last year?
Oh yeah, Pagano should have been fired right there on the spot.
I couldn't believe that he wasn't.
Who is their tight end this year? Is it still the guy from Stanford?
No it's a new guy, I think they got rid of him last year. Some guy named Swoope.
Well I hope he's good.
Yeah me too. I think anyone will be better than Fleener.
Oh that's right, Fleener.
Well let's go Colts!
