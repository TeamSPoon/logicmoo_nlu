Did you see the pictures from fashion week of the Balenciaga catwalk?
Some of them, why?
Those jackets with the huge 1980s shoulder pads are too much.
I know! Sometimes I wonder who wears some of the fashion from the runway.
The jackets were so boxy and the shoulder pads were huge.
There were a lot of sheer pieces during spring fashion week too.
I saw a pair of sheer trousers that looked like clear plastic trash bags.
I know, right?
I did like the sheer lace dresses that Dolce and Gabanna were showing.
I did too but I didn't like the lace ruffle at the bottom.
I thought the ruffle at the bottom was actually kind of cute.
Speaking of sheer and showing it off, there were a ton of bralettes shown.
The one that Kendall Jenner wore was kind of cute. The black scrappy one that went around her neck and crisscrossed in the front.
That was cute. It was just really basic. There were some beautiful ones that weren't as basic. There were florals and even some velvet bralettes.
I must have missed those. I'm not sure about bralettes as a fashion piece for wearing in public anyway.
I think they can be really pretty with high waisted pants or skirts.
I actually really like that look. That way a smaller portion of the stomach shows.
Exactly.
Maybe I will look for a bralette/high waisted skirt combo next time I'm shopping.
Yes, you should. See if anyone makes that in a floral.
