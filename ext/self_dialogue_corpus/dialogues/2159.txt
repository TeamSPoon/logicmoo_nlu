Did you catch the season opener?
Of course I saw it. I wasn't going to miss Romo.
Romo kicked off the season Hall of Fame style.
Do you think he'll get in the Hall of Fame this year.
They might make him wait, but he definitely has earned his spot in the Hall of Fame.
Yeah, you're probably right. They made Manning wait too.
That's a good point. I wonder why they wait so long to induct players in the Hall of fame.
They probably wait to they have a more consistent record of wins.
Well they should also get Brees in the Hall of Fame as well.
Oh, Brees has at least 3 seasons before they consider him.
Well, he also has to have some playoff wins as well.
I thought he's already won in the playoffs.
No, Brees only played twice. He has no wins in the playoffs.
Oh that's right. He hit the playoffs his second year.
That's true, but he only missed the playoffs his rookie year by 3 games.
That's true, but teams would kill for his trade.
Apparently they rotate. I'vee seen a new started for 3 games straight.
They could have had a killer starting line up off the drafts alone.
How much longer does Flacco have on his contract?
He proably has a season on two left.
