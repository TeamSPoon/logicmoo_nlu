I really like classic rock music. How about you?
I tend to like the early rock music from the 50's.  I mean that was a turning point in the music industry.
Early rock in roll, I liked Elvis Presley.
Yes, yes yes, Blue Suede shoes was my all time favorite song by Elvis.
It was definitely a song to dance too but my favorite was Jail House Rock.
Did you like Mr. Chuck Berry at all?
i do like Chuck Berry especially Johnny B Good.
He was such an icon to rock in roll and so was Buddy Holly.
The day Buddy Holly died was surreal and as I understand it really put a cut into rock and roll.
Definitely, just as it did when Elvis overdosed.  The hurt was everywhere.
