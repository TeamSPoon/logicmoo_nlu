What is your favorite comedy movie?
Um, it's a toss up between Black Sheep and Tommy Boy.
Classic! I love Chris Farley and David Spade, especially together.
I know, me too! They are hilarious!
(Singing) Fat guy in a little coat, fat guy in a little coat.
(Laughing) That was one of my favorite parts of Tommy Boy!
Me too! And when Chris Farley's character broke the car door...
And tried to blame it on David Spade's character. So funny!!
Those are two movies that I never get tired of watching. They make me laugh every time!
Me too!
