NFL season is coming up soon!
That's right it is!
Who do you think will be a sleeper team this season?
I have a weird feeling that the Chargers are going to be a surprise
They definitely drafted players for Philip Rivers to utilize.
They have to. He only has a few years left.
It's crazy that he's the only quarterback out of the main three from the draft to not have a ring
Who were the others again? Big Ben and Eli
Yeah those are the ones. It would be nice if he won a ring  finally
I agree, but that defense is still kind of so-so.
Yeah I doubt they will win it all, but I think they will grab a wild card spot
I think they will, but they will probably lose in the first round
Just so sad that Marlon McCree single-handedly stopped Rivers from winning that ring.
All he had to do was give himself up and it was a done deal.
Those early 2000 Charger teams were amazing
Shaun Phillips and Merriman were completely unstoppable
Yeah, then you had V-Jax and LT.
I miss watching LT dominate every time he touched the ball.
I just realized he never won a ring as well.
So many great chargers players may end up saying the same thing. Such a shame.
