Are you going to be watching the big game between the Vikings and Packers?
Of course, I never miss it
Who are you rooting for?
The Packers
Do you wear one of those foam cheese hats?
Yes, my kids got it for me for my birthday. Who are you rooting for?
The Vikings
Have you always been for them?
Yes, I grew up in Minnesota and as a kid I would go to some of their initial practices in my hometown of Mankato
That would've been really neat to see them practice
It was a lot of fun, those practices were pretty informal being so early in the season
Did you get many autographs?
Yeah, a couple years I got a number of pages full of autographs of some of the great Vikings like Alan page and Carl Eller
Those were the great times, back when the Met Stadium was still open, nothing like them playing football in the open in the middle of winter
Yeah, totally agree. It really lost something when they built the dome, it just wasn't the same
The new Vikings stadium seems to be pretty popular
That's what I hear, but my friends are I haven't been to it yet, so I can only go by what I see on TV
They're playing in Green Bay this week, so it will definitely be in an open stadium, have you heard what the weather is going to be like?
It's supposed to be -10Â° and snowing, chances for a heavy snowstorm
Great! It will be just like the old days.
