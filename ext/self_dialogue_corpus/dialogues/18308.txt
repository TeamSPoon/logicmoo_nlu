Did you hear that U2 is coming to town?
Really, when?
July I think. I might have to go.
I went to their last show here a few years back.
How was it?
Beyond amazing. Quite a performance for basically all of downtown.
This one is a commemoration of the Joshua Tree.
I guess it's been 30 years now, huh? Wow.
Yep. The only bummer is I guess they're not doing any of their other songs.
Probably not. But that album is worth it in my opinion.
Oh, mine too. In fact 'With or Without You' is probably my favorite song of theirs.
That's definitely at the top of my list too.
Also 'Where the Streets Have No Name'.
And 'I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For'.
All classics.
I would like to hear 'Sunday Bloody Sunday' though.
Yeah, I'd say that's another classic.
Different album though. Boo.
I guess we should just be happy they're coming.
True. I'll be even happier if I can get my hands on some affordable tickets.
