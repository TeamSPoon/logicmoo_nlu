What's your favorite punk band?
Probably The Clash.
Great choice, what's your favorite album?
I go back and forth between the self titled and London Calling.
I think I would give London Calling the slight edge.
See while I go back and forth, if forced to choose would go in the opposite direction.
London Calling is just so musically varied though.
It is but their self titled album is so raw and aggressive.
Guess I'll take the band at their most creative.
Well if you want to use the most creative argument, wouldn't Sandinista take the bill?
It was certainly creative but lacked the playability of London Calling.
Fair point and I agree.
London Calling is in my mind the single greatest album ever made.
You certainly aren'5alone in your assesment
That means It's their best album!
Nice try but critics can be and often are wrong.
I'm going to listen to Brand New Cadillac.
I'm going to listen to I'm so bored with The USA.
Have fun.
Yeah you as well.
