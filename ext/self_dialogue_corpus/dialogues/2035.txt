Hey, what do you think about football?
As in the NFL?
Yea, the NFL.
I think it is a terrible sport!
Oh?
Yes!  Overgrown men slamming into each other getting injuries
Oh it's not THAT dangerous
Actually it's super dangerous
How so?
As I told you - lots of injurie
I guess?
Like concussions
There are quite a few of those
Yea, it's horrible!
I wouldn't limit it just because of injuries though...
Oh, but can't they play nice?
It wouldnt be football then
Well My son will never play!
That sucks for him!
