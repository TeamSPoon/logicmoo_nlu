Is DC ever going to come close to Marvel in terms of film success?
No, they write better comics but cant make films.
They have one superstar, and thats Batman
They need to cast bigger stars into their superhero roles.
Yeah like it seems every big Marvel role is held by a big name actor or actress.
It brings people to the theaters.
Does DC have a release schedule like Marvel?
I dont think so, I know Wonder Woman is coming out.
And thats not held by a big actress right?
Not big, shes been in some smaller stuff.
Yeah they cant endear themselves
Did you like Suicide Squad?
Not really Will Smith was boring.
I couldnt get through the entire thing.
It was written in a formula.
There were some big names in that.
There was but the plot was overused.
They cant deviate much from the comic books.
Why not?
Fanboys wont go and thats who theyre banking on to fund these kinds of films or at least make their money back.
