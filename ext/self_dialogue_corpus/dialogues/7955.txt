Whose your favorite pop artist?
I love brittney spears!
Yes she is awesome, i really love the way she goes out of the box with her performances
Yes i loved her MTV music award performances
Do you know if she still performs?
I know she was headlining in vegas im not sure if she still is though
Oh i see, my favorite song from her would have to be "im a slave for you"
Yes its such a catchy song too
I think that was the song she came out with a live snake at the MTV awards
Oh yes that was very scary! She so brave for that performance
