One thing I’ve always felt Disney did great was tell stories in their films.  Any movie that really stands out as telling a great story to you?
I’d have to say, Beauty and the Beast. I have always thought that movie was just a great story.
I completely agree. It’s an amazing movie, but also a classic story that speaks for itself.
Definitely. While it is simple, it’s quite compelling at the same time.
A formally man, now cursed to be a monster manages to find love.
Yes, and the thing is, they present Belle as believable in terms of falling for him.
I also like the character development of The Beast, especially. As the film goes on, you get to see his softer side.
I think that is part of what makes the movie so great. You begin to really like him.
Yes. Overall, Beauty and the Beast is an amazing story.
I completely second that. It’s a classic and always will be.
