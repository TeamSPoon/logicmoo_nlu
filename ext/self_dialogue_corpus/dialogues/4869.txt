Do you think Kershaw is gonna win the Cy Young again?
I would think so but you can never count out Scherzer.
I don't mind Scherzer, but it's much tougher to pitch in that park.
I agree with that but he's still putting up monster numbers.
Who do you think can come out of the National League?
I like the Nats or Dodgers to come out this year.
What about the Cubs?
I think they have a bit of a hangover from winning last year. They haven't looked good.
I agree, it all comes down to arms and they don't have any aces.
Arrieta is a shell of himself.
Yeah, I'm beginning to think more and more two years ago was a fluke.
Well he came out of nowhere and wasn't good with Baltimore.
What about the AL. Who do you think is coming out of there?
I personally like the Yankees.
That's a bit surprising but hard to dismiss their fast start.
Plus they have all the money to spend at the deadline.
I do love what Girardi is doing with a mix of young and old.
Completely agree, love Holliday mixed in with Judge and Sanchez.
Well, who do you think wins the World Series.
I have to go with the Dodgers. Give me 3 starts from Kershaw in a 7 game series and I'll take my chances.
