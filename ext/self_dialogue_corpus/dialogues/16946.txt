You know how once in a while you listen to someone and expect to dislike their music because of their image?
Yeah, that happens to me sometimes. Why?
Well I just listened to Pink's album "I'm Not Dead" and I really like it.
You didn't expect to?
Whenever I think about her I get this image of a drunk rocker chick sticking her pierced tongue out at me and then puking on my shoes.
That's vivid, and kind of icky.
Right? But I listened to the album and really liked it!
What did you like about it?
I think most of it is actually her voice. I really like her voice.
What about it do you like?
It's gravelly but somehow it doesn't sound like it hurts.
Oh, the raspy kind of sound?
Yeah. Sometimes that sound in men doesn't bug me but it almost always does in women.
Most female rock singers do have smoother voices than hers.
But hers doesn't bug me. It reminds me of an old jazz singer in a spy movie.
Sultry and smokey?
Exactly! That and there's one song near the end of the album that really sold me.
What's the last song? I've heard a lot of her music but not in album order.
The One That Got Away I think is the title. It's the 11th song and it's this cool solo acoustic story-song which I loved.
I haven't heard that one, but will definitely look it up!
