Hey, have you heard of Twenty One Pilots?
Yeah, I think I heard them on the radio a few weeks ago.
Do you have a favorite song?
Nah, not really. Like I said, I just hear them on the radio.
Ah, gotcha. Well, you should check out their older stuff.
Like what?
Car radio is really good, as well as House of Gold.
Are those their most popular songs?
Nah, but they are really good. their older is stuff is a lot more introspective.
Is their newer stuff not like that?
Not really. It's a lot more poppy, and thus appealing to a broader audience.
That doesn't sound like a bad thing.
It's not, but they lost their original sound.
What do you mean?
It's just too generic now.
I guess that's fair. how long have you been listening to them?
For about 5 years.
Dang, that's a pretty long time. Especially considering I just heard them on the radio.
Yeah, I went to one of their concerts too. Best one I've ever been to.
Sounds awesome!
