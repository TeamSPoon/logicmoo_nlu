Sleepless in Seattle was always one of my favorites.
ya I love the end when Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks finally meet.
It makes me wish the movie was a little longer.
Ya that's true like did they end up getting married?
Ya all we know is that they meet on the top of the Empire State Building.
Ya because Meg Ryan loves An Affair to Remember.
Ya I like how they show clips from that movie in it.
Every time I see Sleepless in Seattle it makes me want to watch An Affair to Remember
Sleepless in Seattle seems to have a happier story.
That's true, except for Tom Hanks's wife having died.
Oh ya but that's a good setup for the movie though that he doesn't think he can fall in love again.
Ya and then when his son calls into the radio show he starts talking about his wife again.
Oh that's right bu then Meg Ryan's character hears it and she decides to write him the letter even though she is engaged.
Ya but her fience is boring. Wasn't he played by Bill Pullman?
I think you are right. Has he even been in a movie recently.
I'm not sure but I know he was in a couple of great romantic comedies in the ninties.
Oh ya wasn't he also in Sleepless in Seattle?
Yes, with Sandra Bullock and some other great character
That's such a funny movie. I love the family in that one.
Oh the family is the best. Especially his parents.
