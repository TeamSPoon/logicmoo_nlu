Are you under the impression that Hip-Hop and rap are similar, or like the same?
No, not at all since rap clearly sucks.
What do you take 'rap' to be?
Well, clearly rap is poppy radio crap that has more repeated hooks than actual verses, right?
That is somewhat of an intricate approach to a larger explanation, though i certainly think it's clear where you're going with it.
Why, what would you say?
Of course random opinion is not relevant, rather as spoken from the mouths of the architects, "rap is business music & Hip-Hop is cultural music" .
Oh, damn well perhaps i like both.
Word, in the end the labels of Hip-Hop, Asian, skinny, hetero/homo, independent, or conservative are completely irrelevant and clearly harmful.
Yeah, too bad i'm too basic to care
