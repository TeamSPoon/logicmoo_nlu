Do you prefer Biggie or Tupac?
I always think it's funny we feel like we have to pick. But that said - Tupac.
Me too. I just like his flow better.
He was more political in his lyrics than Biggie, too, which I always liked.
Me too, political rap is the best type.
They were both so talented though, and it feels stupid to 'pick' one.
It's because of the East Coast/West Coast thing, I guess. We all get caught up iun the rivalry.
Which is such a shame, since that's what killed him.
And he was so young. Who knows what he could've done with more time.
In my opinion he's already the greatest rapper ever, and that's with such a small discography. It really is sad.
