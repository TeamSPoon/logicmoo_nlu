What do you think about Lady Gaga's collaborations with Beyonce?
I think they are great! They both are good at sharing time and making sure that their styles are incorporated.
Did you like Video Phone or Telephone?
I prefer Telephone because it has a better dance beat, but Video phone is fun and sexy.
I really like the Video Phone music video, personally, because of all the different styles Beyonce wears.
Me too! I just mean that I like to work out and dance to Telephone better, but the Video Phone video is better than Telephone.
I agree totally. Which vocals do you like better Beyonce's or Lady Gaga's in Telephone?
I like Lady Gaga's more because she has a bit more energy. What about you?
I like Beyonce's a bit better because she sounds like you don't want to mess with her. What about the vocals in Video Phone?
Oh for sure Beyonce outperforms Lady Gaga just by the sheer differences in styles she uses throughout the track.
