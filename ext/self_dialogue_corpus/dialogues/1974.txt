I love watching football highlights online.
Why? what's the point of rewatching stuff?
I get to see stuff from games I missed.
Is it really that important?
Some of the plays are really amazing!
I guess.
I also love watching old stuff, from guys before my time. Some of them were so talented.
I've never thought about doing that.
I love to do it over the off season, or even on a bye week.
How long do you usually spend watching old clips?
It just depends, anywhere from 30 minutes to 3 hours.
That's a lot!
Yeah I know, but I love it.
Who is your favorite player to watch?
I don't know if I have a favorite.
Well who do you watch a lot?
Hmmm.. I love watching William Perry.
I don't think I've heard of him before.
Maybe you know him by his nickname. The Refrigerator.
Yeah! I've heard of the refrigerator before.
