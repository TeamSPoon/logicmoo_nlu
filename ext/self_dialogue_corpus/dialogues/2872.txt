Which NFL team do you think has the best uniforms?
I might be biased because blue is my favorite color, but the Broncos blue jerseys look pretty great
I prefer their primary orange ones myself, but they're pretty good
There's a lot of blue in the league, like the Panthers all-blue jerseys
Those ones look pretty cool with the black stripes, and so do the Lions' grey and blue
But if I had to choose who has the best uniforms overall, I might go with the Green Bay Packers
Right, the green and yellow is just so iconic that it's hard to ignore
I think when people think of the NFL, they think of the Green Bay Packers
Makes sense, they've been around for a very long time
They played the Chiefs in the very first Superbowl, too, even though it wasn't called that at the time
Speaking the Chiefs, their red and yellow stand out quite a bit too
Sure, but if I have to go with a red team, I'd pick the 49ers and their red and gold
Those are pretty cool, but I don't like their new all black alternate uniforms
Neither do I, but I think that's because they missed a good opportunity to outline the numbers in gold to include all the team's colors
So who do you think has the worst uniforms in the NFL?
Everyone hates on the Tampa Bay Buccaneers' new uniforms, but I actually think they're pretty cool
I feel the same way about the Jaguars new multi-colored helmets
They do look odd, but when I look at their old uniforms I think the decision was the right one
I also don't like that the Dallas Cowboys almost always wear white at home games, but I hear that they're changing things around
Yeah, their blue jerseys look much better, and I'm glad we're going to be seeing more of them next season
