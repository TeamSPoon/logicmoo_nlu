Do you think that Rey is underwritten as a character?
Yes. Her ability to access the Force was the biggest distraction in The Force Awakens.
Why do you think that?
Luke and Anakin had to train and still got beaten up in their trilogies.
Oh, right.
However, they could make her into a new Chosen One.
That would be too repetitive.
I agree, but these movies tend to recycle certain elements.
Yes, but only to a point. The Prequels didn't copy plots.
Ah, true.
