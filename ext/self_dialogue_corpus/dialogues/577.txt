Honey, wake up!
What? What's happening?
You were dreaming again.
Dreaming? And you woke me up?
You were having another nightmare.
I was?
It was obvious.
What do you mean?
Well, first you let out a horrific scream...
I screamed again?
Yes. And then you started to perspire terribly.
I uess my pajamas are a bit moist...
And then you began to sob uncontrollably.
Not again.
Yeas. Again.
Some day you will get over it. Some day you will recover and your nightmares will be a thing of the past.
You think so?
Yes dear.  Now go back to sleep.
OK. Thanks dear.
And stop crying over the retirement of Peyton Manning. The Denver Broncos will just have to live without him, and you will too.
