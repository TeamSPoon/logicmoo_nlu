I like the Oakland Raiders.
They are really good.
They began in 1960.
They are a AFC West team.
Their uniform is Black and Silver.
Sometimes it is white and silver.
Mark Davis is the owner.
He is the majority owner.
Their president is Marc Badain.
General manager is Reggie McKenzie.
Jack Del Rio is the head coach.
They have changed their names.
First they were the Oakland Raiders.
Then LA Raiders.
Back in Oakland now.
They are moving to Vegas.
I do not know if they know when.
I call them Raider Nation.
I call them MIB.
Yes, Men in Black.
