Who do you think is the best songwriter out right now?
I don't know man, maybe one of those country singers?
Really? Like who?
Does Keith Urban right his own songs?
I'm not sure, he's pretty good though.
Who do you think is the best?
Honestly, probably Ed Sheeran?
Really?
Yeah man, all of his songs are so catchy and I'm pretty sure he writes most of them.
I'll give you that, they are catchy.
And, did you know he wrote a bunch of other famous songs?
Nah, I didn't know that, what'd he write?
I know you hate Bieber, but he wrote Love yourself, which is a smash.
Ok, the lyrics and melody are good on that one.
He wrote a bunch of one direction songs too.
What about songs I would actually like?
He wrote Old School Love by Lupe and a taylor swift song.
He really wrote the Lupe song? That's awesome
Yeah man, he's a talented guy.
I guess he has to be with his looks.
