I've really been into the old thriller movies latetly.
Really, which ones have you been wathcing?
I watched Nightmeare on Elm Street the other night.
That was a super scarey movie when I was growing up.
Yeah, Freddie Krueger was a maniac!
For sure, that guy gave me nightmears!
Any thriller type movies that you enjoy?
I liked the Sixth Sense with Bruce Willis.
I forgot about that one.  That was so suspensful and I didn't know what was going on until the end.
Me too.  It all made sense when I found out Bruce Willis was really dead the entire time.
