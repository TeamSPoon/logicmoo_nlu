Is there any movies you'd like to see?
No new releases come to mind, but I wouldn't mind re-watching an older movie.
What movies would you like to see?
The other day I watched the original Alien movie. I wouldn't mind watching Alien 2.
There was a Alien 2?
Oh yes, and an Alien 3 and 4 I think. Of course there was Predator vs. Alien.
Isn't that movie kind of old?
Oh yeah, the original Alien movie must be more than ten years old.
I don't really care for movies that are too old, because the special effects are lacking.
Actually the effects in Alien were ahead of their time. I don' think you would be disappointed.
Who stars in that?
Sigourney Weaver is the main star, but the other actors are less notable.
Has Sigourney Weaver been in any other movies?
I'm sure she has, but Alien is the only movie of hers that I recall for sure.
Where can we watch Alien 2?
I'm sure we can watch it on Netflix or Amazon Prime. Do you have either of those?
I have Amazon Prime, but their selection isn't great so I'm not sure they would have Alien 2.
We can go to my place and watch it on Netflix.
Is Alien 2 appropriate for kids?
Aside from scare sequences (is it sci-fi horror after all) and some cartoonish gore and mild cussing it should be fine.
