Hi there.
Hello there.

Not bad.
Baseball fan?
Yeah I like baseball.
Same here.  Who is your team?

I like the Mets.
The mets are okay.
Yeah they're doing alright this year.
Strong bullpen.
Yeah except they don't show up to the games?
How do you mean?
Harvey not showing up.
Oh I didn't hear about that.
Out late partying.
Man that is a bonehead move.
You're telling me.
