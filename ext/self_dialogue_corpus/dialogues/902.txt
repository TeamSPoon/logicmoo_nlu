Did you read about the draft grade that the Chicago Bears got?
Yes, they had a horrible draft!
That front office is the worst in all of football.
They have to be. That trade from the third position up to the second position was just bizarre.
On ESPN, everyone says that San Francisco "fleeced" the Bears' front office.
Wow, that is strong language, but they're right.
I was watching the draft live at home, and i was stunned when they announced that the Bears were moving up.
Me too! I thought all along that they would take a defensive lineman or move down and take the safety from LSU.
Right. Every projection had them taking a "can't miss" lineman at number three or even a strong safety.
But instead they trade up one spot to take a quarterback!
I just don't get it. Trubisky is just the best of a terrible class of quarterbacks this year.
I agree. He only played one year at North Carolina on top of it all.
I wouldn't mind the pick as much if the Bears hadn't just signed Mike Glennon to a huge contract to the quarterback for 2017.
Why would they sign Glennon and then draft a quarterback when they have so many other needs on that team?
It makes no sense. That front office is pathetic.
They are awful. And don't even get me started with the Bears drafting a Division II tight end in the second round.
I was still in shock when I saw their second pick, and I just threw my hands up in disgust.
Me too. The Bears will be the worst team in the NFL this year.
Well at least they'll have another high draft pick next year.
That doesn't matter if the front office has no idea how to run a proper draft room!
