What rock band are you listening to nowadays?
I've been listening to Eagles of Death Metal a lot recently. They're a lot of fun.
Really? I heard they are great live.
They are, I saw them just last month on tour, but Josh Homme was not touring with them.
He's really busy with the new Queens of the Stone Age record. Do you like them too?
Yeah, they're fun and the steady rhythms are always catchy.
They're a call back to when rock stars were rock stars.
Definitely. Josh Homme has that old school swagger about him.
I know he met Jesse Hughes in high school, and they became friends years before starting a band together.
Really? I didn't know that. They seem so different.
