Hey did you hear about some of the Falcon players?
No what happened? Good news or bad news?
It was great news.
Well what did they do?
Devonta Freeman, Marquand Manuel, and a few other players organized a free football and cheerleading camp.
That is awesome! I love to see players giving back to the community.
Yeah that is great to hear some great news for a change.
Wow that is amazing. Where exactly is the camp located.
It is located in Miami, FL. Its near Devonta Freeman's old neighborhood where he grew up.
It must of been very rewarding for him to do that.
Yeah that's cool he was able to set up a camp seeing that he is having some contract issues with the Falcons.
Yeah I hope he can settle soon because he really is a valuable player.
He is underpaid and he wants more money. I don't blame him.
Do you think he will sign the current contract or become free agent?
I think there is some negotating going on behind the scenes.
I hope he decides to stay on the Falcons
I understand where he is coming from. His loyalty is very strong for the Falcons
Yeah because he is will to negotiate his contract and not just leave.
Overall he is a great player and him creating this camp in his old neighbor hood shows that he is a great person.
I totally agree with that.
