There sure seem to be a lot of action movies out these days.
I guess that's what's selling at the movie theaters.  There are so many younger people going.
Yes.  My teenagers like to go with their friends.  I think they like to just hang out.
I don't imagine they would be into seeing a romantic comedy.
Probably not.  They do like the action, but they also like the animated shows.
Those are actually pretty good.  I never thought I would like them, but they do a good job with them.
It's amazing what computers can do now.  Some of those look almost real.
Yes.  When you watch some of the Avenger shows or the Transformer shows.  It's pretty impressive what they can do.
You have to remind yourself that it's fake.
I will say that I do like the whole Avengers series.  Lots of action and usually pretty good plots.
They've done a great job with those.  I remember those characters from comic books growing up.
Yes.  I remember them also from the Saturday morning cartoons.
I also thought Star Wars was pretty great when I was younger, but these new ones are way better done.
May the graphics are better, but I have to say that I like the older movies better.  I thought they had better story lines.
Some of the characters on the ones now can be kind of unforgettable compared to those older ones.
Pretty crazy how that whole series has stood the test of time.  We were into it as kids, and now our kids are into it.
Jurassic Park is another one like that.  I loved the first one, but I will say that I enjoyed this last one just as much.
Yes.  Chris Pratt did a great job.
I wonder what movies will look like in 10 years.
I can't imagine.  I never thought they would be where they are right now.  Could be interesting.
