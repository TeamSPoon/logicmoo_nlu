I want to go to the movie theater but I'm not sure what to see.
You should see Rough Night!
Really? I heard it wasn't very good.
The reviews aren't great.
Why should I see it then?
It's still funny! I don't like to pay attention to reviews before I see a movie.
Why? They're so helpful.
If it's a negative review, it ruins the movie for me.
Ah, I see. Who's in Rough Night?
It's such a good cast! Scarlet Johansson, Ilana Glazer, Kate McKinnon, Jillian Bell, and Zoe Kravitz.
Wow, that's a ton of good people.
Yeah, they're all so funny.
Maybe I will see it.
Also, it's so nice to have a movie like that with a mostly all-female cast.
That's true! Women can be so funny in those situations.
I know. More filmmakers should make that sort of thing.
I will see it then.
Good! It's directed by a woman, too.
That's so great!
Yeah, you gotta see it.
