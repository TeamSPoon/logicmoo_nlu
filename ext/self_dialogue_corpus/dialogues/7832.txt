Which Deathly Hallows do you think was better?  The first or second.
I think the first one was.
I agree, there was the story lesson about the Hallows themselves.
Yeah, the last movie was great especially the battle.  But it seemed to be all battle.
I know what you mean, it was like a huge cool battle but not many plot devices.
Except wasn't that the one where Snape revealed his memories?
Yes it was, easily one of the best scenes in the entire series.
I also liked the part where Nevel killed the snake.
That was great, Nevel became a total hero.
Just like they always said don't sleep on anyone.
