Are you familiar with the twilight zone?
Yeah, why?
Because I was watching Perry Mason the other day and I thought I recognized some of the music.
As being from the Twilight Zone?
Yeah.
What music?
Well it was somewhere in season two of Perry Mason, and I thought it was the same music from the Twilight Zone episode with the slot machine.
Oh, I know exactly what music you're talking about!
Yay! You remember what was playing when the machine is stalking him at his room?
Yeah I can hear it as if it was playing right now.
Is that not the same music?
I believe it is. There was a lot of good music from the Twilight Zone but that particular music is very trademark.
Probably the only more iconic music from it was during the theme.
I love that. I wonder if when they came up with that they knew how many people would do a take off on it in the future.
I don't know, I think it's just one of those things that was kind of accidental.
They definitely did a good job with all the music in the series though.
I agree, from the slow teasing scenes to the abrupt jarring scenes.
They always know exactly what music to employ to set the scene.
And to scare you or intrigue you as well.
Exactly.
