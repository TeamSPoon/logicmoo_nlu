Do you think Belle or Ariel makes a better heroine?
Definitely Belle I think.
Why Belle? She really didn't triumph anything.
Not true. Belle used compassion and morals to overcome her obstacles as where Ariel's answer was to make a deal with the devil so to speak.
I never thought of it that way.
Belle gave up freedom to protect her father, then swayed the staff to adore her while convincing a think headed man he was worth something.
And you don't see the sacrifices Ariel made just as important?
No because Ariel's answer was to try to cheat to get a man to love her while keeping secrets.
So if this a feminist thing?
Not feminist per se but I do see Belle as a stronger female since she didn't try to take the easy road out.
