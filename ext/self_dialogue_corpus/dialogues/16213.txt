What's your favorite kind of music?
Right now I would say I'm really into bluegrass and folk.
Oh that's cool. Who are your favorite bands?
I've been listening to a lot of lumineers. I would like to go see them.
Are they touring in your area this year?
Yes but I don't really like the venue they are going to be at.
Oh really, why not?
It's always so crowded and it's pretty far from my house.
Are you going to any concerts this year?
Yes, in fact, I'm going to see Paul Simon next week.
Wow that will be fun!
Yes he's one of my all time favorites.
Is garfunkel appearing as well?
No I don't think he will be there.
Is there another band opening for Paul Simon?
Probably but right now I can't remember.
I'm also going to see some concerts.
Oh cool!  I hope you have fun.
Thanks!  I'm going to a big music festival in august.
Those are always great!
