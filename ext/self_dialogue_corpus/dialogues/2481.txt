Who do you think will make it to the Super bowl this year?
I think the Steelers and Falcons have a good chance, how about you?
I'm going to say the Cowboys and Patriots.
You think the Cowboys can beat the Falcons?
I think it will come down to who has home field advantage in the playoff game.
I think Dallas will have an off year, they're still a young team.
They have some great young players though, I think they'll be tough.
They have a tough schedule though but you never know.
I think the AFC is definitely the Pats or Steelers though.
I think Pittsburgh just has too many weapons though.
I think they depend on if Bell gets hurt.
Yeah, he's a little injury prone but probably best back in the league when he's healthy.
Oh yeah I agree but he's never healthy for long.
They got more protection this year though, so if him and Brown stay healthy I don't see anyone beating them.
I still think Brady takes it.
Who do you think wins it all though?
I think the Pats in a close game, how about you?
I think Pittsburgh takes it, I can't see any NFC team competing with the Pats or Steelers.
I think they can stay close but I agree the AFC is going to be tough to beat.
Yeah, it's going to be a good season I think.
