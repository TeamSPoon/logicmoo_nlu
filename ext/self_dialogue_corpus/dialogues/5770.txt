What is your favorite Disney movie?
That's a tough one, if I had to pick a favorite it would be Aladdin.
Have you seen Beauty and the Beast?
Yes, I like that one, too.
What about Snow White or Cinderellla?
I liked those, but they weren't my favorite, my favorite is Aladdin.
Have you seen the Emporer's new groove?
Oh, yes, that's my second favorite, It's hilarious, Kronk cracks me up.
Yeah, I like the squirrel scouts thing with Izma.
Haha, Yeah, Squeaker Squeak Squeakin.
