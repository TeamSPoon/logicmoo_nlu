Who would be your dream match up in the 2018 Superbowl?
Any two teams, no division restrictions?
Yes, two teams that you would like to see play each other.
present day teams, I would love to see the Saints take on Atlanta Falcons
Saints versus Falcons, really? Who would you root for?
The Saints, but I don't think they would win.
Why is that?
The Falcons 2017 team are hungry and looking for redemption after the theft of the 2017 Superbowl against the patriots.
How did they steal the game?
Seriously? The patriots looked asleep until the fourth quarter.
But Tom Brady still showed up in the end.
true, but there for a minute I had to wonder if he was throwing the game, cause he sure wasn't throwing the ball!
I think the Falcons will do alright this year, their offense is fierce.
The only thing I would have them work on would be special teams.
I agree, special teams is where the game is often won or lost.
Definately need a solid second string field goal kicker
Who do you like coming up thru the ranks?
If it were me, I would take a long look at OU
Why OU?
They consistantly have strong players with a solid skill foundation and play well under pressure.
