Do you like any of Kanye West's music?
I used to. Some of his songs were pretty good.
One of my most favorite songs of his was "Gold Digger".
Right! I loved that one.
His song "Heartless" was pretty good too.
I remember that one also. It had a great beat to it.
Yes it did. I'm not a huge fan now though.
I'm not really either.
I think he's slightly overrated.
I agree. He's too full of himself these days.
