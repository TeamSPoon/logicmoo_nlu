My favorite STAR WARS character is R2-D2.
His top would spin all around.
And he had a few blinking lights.
And he had the thing that could connect to the DEATH STAR.
He could tell the DEATH STAR computer what to do.
He made funny sounds that sounded like what he was saying.
He had like 3 legs. But I never saw him go up stairs.
Maybe that's why they always had ramps.
He could also do those hologram messages.
Without him they would never have gotten that message.
