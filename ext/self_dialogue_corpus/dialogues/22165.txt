I wonder when they will make a John Wick 3?
Oh yeah, that was a great movie. I like both the John Wick films.
I do as well, don't you think they set it up for there to be a third movie?
For sure they did, now he has the whole world after him since he crossed the continental owner.
I think it is amazing how good the fight choreography and gun play is in those movies.
I agree, I think it has the best shoot outs out of any other movie.
Right? Every shoot out lasts for a really long time and every moment is heart pounding action.
I can't imagine how creative you would have to be to come up with those scenes.
How about how hard it would be just to learn and perform all those fight scenes for the actors?
That's an extraordinary amount of work to make them look as real and convincing as they do.
The sequences just go on for so long I don't get how its even possible to hold so much choreography in your memory and make it look good.
I think the third one is going to be even more epic, they are great at stepping up the action for the next movie.
I didn't think you even could top the fighting and shooting in John Wick but somehow the second one did.
It almost reminds me of like a kung fu style movie like Jackie Chan would make.
Why is that?
Well its obviously not the same type of movie but it seems that it really takes from the fighting style and cinematic feel of the fight scenes in Jackie Chan movies.
Ah OK. I can see that, the old school martial arts movies definitely paved the way for this genre and type of film that John Wick is.
I'm surprised we don't see as many mainstream fight films with the same style John Wick has.
I think they are out there, its just that none have reached the success or notoriety as John Wick.
I think Keanu Reeves is a big reason for that, he is a huge star and has a lot of fans due to films like The Matrix.
