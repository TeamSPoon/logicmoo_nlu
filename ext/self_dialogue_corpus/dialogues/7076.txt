There's something about Aladdin that is just so charming.
Truly one of the best Disney movies, no contest.
I love Aladdin and Jasmin as characters and the animation is so great.
Really good setting for a film too, we don't get many of those.
Agreed, especially in a children's animation.
Jafar is one of my favorite villains, so sinister looking.
Indeed, the movie has a great balance of characters.
Yeah and we're even forgetting the best of all, can you guess it?
The genie, man, how can I not guess it?
We should totally watch Aladdin this weekend.
