Are you a star wars fan?
I like it.
Have you seen any of the movies?
Yeah, I like Darth Vader.
He's scary
His story was sad
It was sad that he was tricked to turn to the dark side and sad about Padme
And that he almost died and wore the suit
Most people would have given up
He did have that going for him
