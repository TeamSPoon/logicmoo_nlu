Football season's starting soon.
Yes it is. I've got my Sunday's booked then.
How're the Bears looking this year?
They're a mess, as usual.
Yeah, why so?
Starting at the top, the QB situation is questionable at best.
Don't believe in Mike Glennon?
I think he's okay, but there's a reason he's been a back up for a while.
What about Trubiskey?
The rookie? I hope they don't rush him?
But if Glennon does poorly, the fans will call for him.
Yeah, but there's no point in throwing a rookie into the fire with a weak team.
True, letting Alshon Jeffrey leave didn't help.
He's a top receiver for any team, but he might be a waste on the Bears.
I think he'll do well with the Eagles this year.
I hope so. I really do like him.
He can really play, bummer about the Bears though.
I'm thinking last in the division this year.
I guess we'll find out.
I guess so.
