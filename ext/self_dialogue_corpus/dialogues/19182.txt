What do you think of Gregory Alan Isakov?
Is he a singer/songwriter?
Yes. He had a great album a few years ago that I can't stop listening to.
I know the one. With Big Black Car on it?
Yes that one.
Did you hear the live colorado symphony version?
Yes! I love that version.
You know what else is good?
What?
Ben Folds has an acapella version of a lot of his songs.
I've heard that!
I love the Jesusland version
Me too. And Brick is great.
How about when ben folds just released sheet music for his songs?
that was a really clever idea.
I saw him at Jazz Fest a few years ago
Isn't he the crankiest?
He is but still fun to watch.
I like that sad song about missing his friend.
That one makes me cry.
