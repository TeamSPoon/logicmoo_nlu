What a game last night.
It sure was.
Aren't you glad you we?
Yes, thanks for the tickets.
No problem.
So now we are in first place?
We are tied with the giants.
How long have they been our rivals?
Ever since both were in New York.
Wow.
That was cool you got a foul ball.
It was pretty cool.
What did you do with the ball?
I gave it to my boyfriend.
Does he know you went with me?
No, if he found out he would be upset.
Let's take him tonight.
Let's buy tickets.
I'll buy them.
Get 4 tickets.
