Why do you like disney movies?
I love the magic of them all
So you must like movies with pure magic like Sword and the Stone or Cinderella.
Well not just literal magic, but just the magic of Childhood
What movie are you talking about
Well take peter pan for example.
Oh i love that movie
It uses childhood innocence and wonder to tell us a well known story
I guess that does help them connect to a younger audience
And thats why they remain timeless for so many generations
