How is it that concession stands at a theater is so expensive? how do they justify it?
It goes back to the days when movie studios owned the theaters themselves.
How does that work?
well the movie studios had basically a monopoly over how much to charge, where to sow the movie etc.
That doesn't explain the concession prices.
Well it sort of does. The Supreme Court, yes the Supreme Court decided that is not fair practice and in 1948, mandated theaters and studios share the profits. 20-30% for the theaters, and rest for the studios.
i think I know where this is going. So to make more money..
Yes, so to make more revenues, the theaters started charging more for their concessions, which the studios couldn't not touch at all.
Those bastards.
Well to be fair, 20-30% of the ticket revenue isn't going to keep a theater open. But price gouging on all them sugary, fat delicious stuff,well they kept the theaters profitable.
Huh. Interesting. Why do you know things like that?
What?
I mean why do you know things like that? It's not like a common knowledge.Is there a school that teach you this information? Why do you know that?
I think what you want to ask is HOW i know that, not why. Why is a query into a reason, or the cause. How is an query into the mechanism.
Ugh. fine,. How do you know that?
I was curious so I looked it up the other day.
That was so anticlimatic.
It's the truth, and the truth ain't always so exciting.
Another question. What's the most violent anime ever produced?
Violence is a word that needs some qualifying. What is violence? Language? Gore? Sexual violence? Slow violence that takes over years, quick acute violence that happens in a flash? What do you want to consider the violence to be?
