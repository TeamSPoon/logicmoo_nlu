Rambo or Rocky?
For characters or action?
Both!
Rocky for characters, Rambo for action.
Why not the opposite?
Rambo is a horrible human.
That's not nice to say of someone with PTSD.
That's not what I'm saying. He intentionally returned and chose to be a private army-destroying assassin after "making peace" with his PTSD.
Yeah but he was killing the crap out of the evil Russians.
That was a bit rude, but again, it doesn't matter. he has a couple redeeming qualities, but he goes where he isn't wanted and wages war.
So why is Rocky so good?
He does get brain damage from his own stupidity, but it's his role as a husband and a mentor.
Rambo could have been the same.
But it's not addressed, so you can't assume that.
I agree with you, I was just playing Devil's Advocate.
I also like the action of Rocky more.
Really? Why?
It's more believable.
How so?
Well, Rocky had to take on one person at a time. Rambo, especially in Rambo II, survives because the other army can't aim. It's sad.
