What are you dressing up as this Halloween?
My favorite character in the world--Mary Poppins.
I love her. The movie with Julie Andrews is one of my favorites.
Isn't it great? I love the friendship between Bert and Mary.
They always had such jolly hollidays together!
Good one! I often sing "I Love to Laugh."
All the different types of laughs are so fun!
One sounds just like my Uncle Jamal.
That's hilarious, because one sounds like my Tia Angela!
How funny!
