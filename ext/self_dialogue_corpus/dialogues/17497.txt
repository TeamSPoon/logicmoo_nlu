So what have you been up to lately?
Not to much, just making my mom a CD for her birthday.
It is nice to know that other people still listen to CD's these days!
I know what you mean. It seems like most people are listening to music on their phone, or on some other high tech device.
I just like to listen to old fashioned CD's on my boom box for the most part.
My mom is like that as well, she loves to listen to her CD player while she does things around the house.
So, what type of CD are you making her?
I am making her a mixed CD with a lot of different music on it.
That sounds like a great little gift for her!
I hope so! I am trying to put a few Travis Tritt songs on there, but I am not sure which ones would be good.
Is she a big fan of his?
Yes, she has always really loved his music! I am not familiar with the specific songs that she likes though.
I love country music so I could maybe help you out with it. Does she like slow songs?
Thank you! She does love slow songs, especially if they are heart felt and romantic.
I will give you a few songs to listen to of his and let you decide if you want to add it to the CD or not.
That sounds great! Because after I get three of his songs on there it will be all done.
The Best Of Intentions, Help Me Hold On, and Anymore are all great songs from him.
I have heard Best OF Intentions but I had forgot about it. That is a great song!
If you do not like one of those just let me know and I will recommend another.
Actually, those three are perfect! Thank you so much.
