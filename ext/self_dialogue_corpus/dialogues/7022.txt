What do you think disney's greatest film triumph is?
Hard to say they have had so many hits.
But if you had to pick one.
I suppose Snow white and the seven dwarfs because it took so much to get it made.
Ya at the time it was super innovative and new.
Pretty nuts when you think about how much effort disney had to putin to get this type of animated feature of the ground.
Ya he was an impressive guy. So glad he did work so hard, I love disney films.
Agreed, he was progressive for his day. Not sure he was always the nicest but he got things done.
I certainly feel his films are some of the most treasured of all time.
So many people grew up with disney films and disney world /land hard not to love him and all his film work.
