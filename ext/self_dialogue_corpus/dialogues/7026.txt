What should I rent tonight?
Zootopia!
But it's a kid's movie.
I know, but it's really good.
I want something that isn't a cartoon. I'm not a baby.
No, trust me. It's about race and stereotypes. It's really a great movie.
I don't know.
Jason Bateman is so funny. It's really great.
Maybe.
Watch it! I'll rent your next movie for you if you don't like this one!
