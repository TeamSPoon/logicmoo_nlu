Are you ready for the party?
I think so. I think I have everything.
Do you have the turkey?
I have the turkey.
DO you have the cranerry sauce?
I have the ranberry sauce. I have the green beans too?
Good. And the stuffing mix?
Yes. I have the stuffing mix.
Do you have everything you need to make gravy?
Yes. I have all the fixings!
It sounds like you are ready for the Thanksgiving Day Party!
Yup. Although I still have't gtten the television fixed.
What? THe television is still broken?
Yeah. Maybe I'll hear from the shop on Friday.
But Friday is after Thanksgiving Day!  How are we going to watch the Detroit Lions and the Dallas Cowboys play football if our television if broken?
Now, don't make such a fuss over this.
A fuss?  Thanksgiving Day is not Thanksgiving Day without NFL football!
I know the Lions and the Cowboys play on Thanksgiving Day every year. We will just have to miss watching them on our televison this year.
This is the worst!  This may be the worst Turkey Day ever!
You can stop crying now because I rented a 56-inch plasma TV from Rent-A-Center for Thursday. I am smart enough to know that if you didn't get to see football on Turkey Day, then you would not let anybody else digest any of this food all day.
