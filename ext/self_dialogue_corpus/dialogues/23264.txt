Will Hollywood film a movie about the 2016 presidential election?
Oh they definitely have to.
I think the plot line for it will be riveting.
We all experienced it, but to see it pared down to 2 hours should be good.
They have alot of material to even make it 3 hours.
While they could do that, I dont think its that big.
Maybe not but I think it would be great.
Who would direct it?
I would have Stephen Spielberg do it.
He doesnt really do those kinds of movies.
Anyone else may make it somewhat comedic.
I dont want it to be a parody if they do it
Thats why I think you go ahead and do the documentary style.
Who knows who would want to play Trump.
They would definitely be under scrutiny.
You would hear alot of backlash from DC.
Thats how movies are though, theyd understand.
Depends on the light in which you portray his character.
I think it would be good.
People would definitely be interested
