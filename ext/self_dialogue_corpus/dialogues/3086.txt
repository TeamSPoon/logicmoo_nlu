I'M GOING TO JOHN'S TO WATCH THE GAME SUNDAY. WANNA COME?
WHY WOULD YOU WASTE A BEAUTIFUL DAY INSIDE WATCHING A BUNCH OF MEN RUN AROUND IN THE MUD?ARE YOU KIDDING!
ARE YOU KIDDING! THE PATS ARE PLAYING THE FALCONS IN A REMATCH OF THE SUPER BOWL!
I HEARD ABOUT THE GAME BUT I'M NOT REALLY INTO FOOTBALL.
THAT'S CUZ YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND THE GAME OR KNOW ANY OF THE PLAYERS.
I KNOW ABOUT TOM BRADY, HE HAD AN ISSUE WITH A BALL GOING FLAT.
OMG! NOT THAT AGAIN!
WELL HE DID DIDN'T HE? IT WAS ALL OVER THE NEWS.
THERE IS MORE TO FOOTBALL THANTHAT.IT TAKES A LOT OF MENTAL AND PHYSICAL EFFORT.
I HEARD SOME OF THE PLAYERS STUDY BALLET DURING THE OFF SEASON TO HELP WITH AGILITY AND SPEED
I THINK YOU SHOULD COME SUNDAY AND WATCH THE GAME AND THEN WE'LL SEE WHAT YOU THINK.
I'LL COME BUT I DON'T THINK I'LL LEARN ANYTHING NEW.
WELL WE'LL SEE SUNDAY. MAYBE WE SHOULD PUT A BET ON THE GAME TO MAKE IT INTERESTING!
CARE TO HAVE A CONTEST ON STATS MR. FOOTBALL?
SURE LETS GO! I AM A WALKING FACT BOOK!
OK! FOR $5.00 WHO IS TIED WITH THE PATS FOR 5 WINNING SUPER BOWL GAMES, THE COWBOYS OR THE 49ERS?
RALLY AN EASY ONE?  IT WAS THE COWBOYS, THE 49ERS ONLY WON 4 BOWLS.
WRONG!  THEY ALL WON 5 GAMES!  HAND OVER MY 5!
OK FINE YOU WIN! YOU COMING SUNDAY?
CAN'T.  I HAVE TICKETS TO THE GAME! WANNA COME?
