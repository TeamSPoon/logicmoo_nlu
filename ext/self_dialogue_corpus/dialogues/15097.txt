Do you have a favorite Woody Allen comedy?
That's a tough one. "Play It Again, Sam," I guess.
I liked that, too. But my favorite is "Annie Hall."
Why "Annie Hall"?
I think it's a really good story, with some serious elements, but also with a lot of comedy.
The part I remember best is when they tried to cook the lobsters.
Yes, that was good. I liked when they were standing in line at the movies and Woody's character was rolling his eyes at some of the pretentious moviegoers.
Oh, and then he pulled in Marshall McLuhan to set them straight?
Yes. Very funny. I also like his old school comedies, like "Bananas".
That was with the actress from "Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman," right?
