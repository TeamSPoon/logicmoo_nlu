Do you like country music?
Yes, but I tend to listen to the "older" type.
What do you mean?
Well, like from the 70s-90s.
Which artists do you like?
I really like Garth Brooks, Alabama, Patty Loveless, etc.
Do you listen to current country music at all?
Just a little.
What don't you like about the more modern country style?
I don't know; I think it's just more of the content.
Meaning what?
Well, like it seemed more innocent before.  Though, some music is still like that, I suppose.
does that mean you do not listen to modern, non-country music?
Sometimes I do, but I guess that same aspects still bothers me. A lot of it just seems more intimate or something
I like the fast-paced beat of modern music.  There are some artists in particular who seemed to do well with this.
Who do you like?
Rhianna, is one of them.
is there anyone else she like in particular?
Yes, I actually really like Adele.  I think all of her music is excellent.
I agree with that. I like her music too!
