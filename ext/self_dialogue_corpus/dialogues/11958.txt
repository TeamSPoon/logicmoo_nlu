What did you think of Rogue One?
I was a little disappointed.
What disappointed you?
It was a little dull for me.
Wow. I thought it was action packed.
They spend most of the movie planning.
I guess it does take a while for the action to get going.
I also didn't care for the way they put Peter Cushing's Grand Moff Tarkin in with digital effects.
That wasy weird but the Dark Vader scene.
OK, he totally kicked butt in that one scene.
