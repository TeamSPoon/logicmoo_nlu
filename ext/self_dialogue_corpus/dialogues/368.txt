What did you think about Tony Stark's choice to attack without his suit in the third movie
I thought he was crazy
Stark always had a trick up his sleeve
It was sad when they pushed him out of his company
What kind of weapon do you think shoots out of his hands?
It looks like some kind of flamethrower
I liked the kid's character who kept his armor safe for him
Yeah, he had some funny lines
It was cool how they connected that movie with the other marvel ones
Yeah, shield was in the other ones
