Have you seen the new Moana movie?
Yes and I really liked it, although my nephews thought the lava monster was a little scary.
haha I could see that. I didn't really know much about Hawaiian culture.
Me either, it was interesting to see Maui come to life.
Ya I think Dwane Johnson did great in that role.
Definiatey different from his most recent roles thats for sure!
I know right... I loved him as Maui.. who knew?!!?
And you're right it was really interesting to see the Hawaiian culture and their legends of creationism and gods.
Yeah I had no idea, it made me want to learn more and visit Hawaii of course!
We should totally plan a trip... because "One day I'll know, how far I'll go"...
