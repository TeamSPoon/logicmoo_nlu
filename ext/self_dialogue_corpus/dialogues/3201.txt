Hey are you ready for football?
Heck yeah i am ready.
Did you see where Marshawn Lynch went.
He is with the Seahawks right?
No he got traded!
Wow he did?
Yes he is with the Raiders now.
Oh wow really?
Yes
I think he will do good with their team.
He is a good player.
I agree.
I think the Seahawks were saying because of his age.
That is sad
He is good he will fit in with the team great.
Derek Carr is good too.
He will be healed by the time it starts.
Good they will be a scary team.
They will do some damage.
I agree. Can't wait to watch!
