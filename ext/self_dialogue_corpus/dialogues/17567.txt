Do you like Imagine Dragon?
I've never hear of them. What genre are they?
I can't believe you haven't heard of them! They are like rock mixed with electro and a bit of pop.
That's way different from what I am use to listening too.
Yea they are really worth listening too.
Do they play any songs that I might know?
Their newest song is called "Believer" and their most popular song is "Radioactive".
Hey, I think I've heard of that song "Radioactive" on a tv show one time.
Oh really? What show?
I heard it on the 100 its a show on Freeform.
That's cool. Yea they are pretty popular.
I really like their style come to think about it. Its different.
Yea, well I was asking if you heard of them because they are on tour right now.
No way! Are you going to get tickets?
Yeah, I was hoping that you would like to go with me.
Of course. When are they going to be in Phoenix, Arizona?
They will be here September 26th of this year.
Yeah I will go! It will be something different
