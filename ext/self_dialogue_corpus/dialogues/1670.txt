Hey man, what's up?
Not much, can't wait for NFL this year.
Yeah me too. You're a Patriots fan, right?
Yes sir, we NFL champions!
Yeah, that was a pretty amazing Superbowl. What do you say to everyone that says Patriots are cheaters?
Haha, well they were not cheating in the Superbowl!
I am talking about the deflategate situation.
That was totally fake. There wasn't any evidence of that.
Honestly, I don't know what happened there. They were accused of deflating balls or something during important games?
Something like that. But they denied the accusations. There was an investigation and everything.
I don't think the investigation was very public.
No it wasn't. How do you substantiate those claims?
Well if there are accusations of something that crazy, you can't think they just came out of thin air can you?
I think that given the Patriots success, it is not unbelievable that others are jealous.
Haha whatever, I just know a lot of my friends think they are cheaters.
Let's assume they cheated. You can't deny Tom Brady and Bob Belichick's pure skill.
That I will agree with. But if they cheated their accomplishments are tainted, in my opinion.
I don't think so. I think they are the greatest NFL pair of all time.
We will see if they win any more championships.
I can assure you, they will, man.
