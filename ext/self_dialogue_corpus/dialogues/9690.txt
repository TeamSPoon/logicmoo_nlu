What do you think about Migos?
I like their song T-Shirt. Another one I like is One Time.
I think they play Bad and Boujee way too much!!
I agree. Just like Future and his song Mask Off.
They play Mask Off a lot but it's a hit. I think it was way better than Turn On the Lights.
Young Thug's album Jefferey sounds pretty good, but they don't play it much.
My song on that album is called Rihanna.
Yeah. I noticed all the songs on Young Thug's Jefferey album is named after famous people.
Young Thug is part of the new generation hip hop, like Lil Uzi Vert.
The best song by Lil Uzi in my opinion is Money Longer.
