I wanna get into hip hop, where do you suggest I start?
Oh man, that's an incredibly tough question. I'm not sure there is a best place to start, but I'll make a recommendation anyway.
Okay, where do you think I should start.
I think you should start with Kendrick Lamar's good kid, m.A.A.d. city. It's recent, sounds recent, the storytelling is great, the sequencing is great, the lyrics are great, and the songs are great.
Where does that fall in his discography?
It's his second official album out of a total of four.
Do you think it is his best?
I think it's his second best, but it's more accessible than To Pimp A Butterfly which is my favorite.
So you're saying I shouldn't start with his best album?
Exactly, I know it sounds counter intuitive, but you'll have a much deeper appreciation if you start with good kid, m.A.A.d. city.
