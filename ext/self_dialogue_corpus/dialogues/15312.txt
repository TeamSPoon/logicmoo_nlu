Do you like classical music?
Yes, but I like more modern classical music like Rimskey-Korsekoff and Rachmoninoff.
Do you like Aaron Copeland?
Yes, but that Beef, it's what for dinner add ruined some of it.
Oh, but I love Rodeo.  Whenever I drive by the Rodeo in Houston I play it.
What about the theme to the Heiriss?
Eh, just okay.  I like his other work better.
I really like Gershwin's concertos.
I do too.  I like his Cuban symphony.
Yeah, it's a great piece of work.  I also love Rhapsody in Blue.
But, I don't like truly modern classical music.
Me either.  I don't like ones that are kind of tuneless.
They are always disappointing.
I would rather listen to Bach.
Ah, Bach. Bach is pretty good.
i like Mozart better than Bach though.
I also like Vivaldi.
Vivaldi is great.
I have the Four Seasons on vinyl.
Hipster!  I'm content with it on CD.
