Did you watch the last episode of Keeping up with the Kardashians?
I did! I thought Khloe looked so hot in her body suit and skin tight jeans.
I know! With her sexy little outfits she always wears, she has an endless line of guys trying to get with her.
Yeah, it's just too bad most of them are black though.
Well, black guys actually have a great sense of fashion!
I'll agree with you there... Some colors just look so much better on them than on white people!
Yes, especially a fresh white T shirt that is a couple of sizes too big.
Yeah, no way a white guy can pull that off.
True that. But I will say, plaid shorts look excellent on a white man.
Mhm. Especially with a light grey t-T-shirt.
But not plaid shirts. Save those for the mexicans.
Haha! Yeah that sounds about right.
Know what is really hot?
No, What?
When a girl who has a perfect badonkadonk wheres some tight yoga pants.
Oh I know! I see those everywhere these days. They had that whole body shameing scandel over them at the high schools...
What do you mean?
Well, as nice as a girls butt is to look at in those pants, people where claiming they were a distraction to male students and teachers.
Oh thats not fair, they should be able to control themselves over a womens fashion choice.
I agree!
