You like superhero movies, right?
Yeah. I loved Civil War was probably my favorite.
Are you looking forward to the new Spiderman?
Tom Holland seems like a good fit. I'm just tired of the origin stories.
I feel you, but I think it'll work well with the whole cinematic universe.
Marvel really can't go wrong recently.
I just watched Doctor Strange, and that was good too.
I thought it was solid, and I didn't even know much about him before the movie.
I'm always looking forward to Marvel movies.
Me too.
