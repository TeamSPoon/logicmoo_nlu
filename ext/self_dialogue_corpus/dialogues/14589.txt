Wow! The Cavs are doing really good.
I know.  "Defend the land".
They just beat Toronto.
And in only 4 games!
They make it seem so easy.
It might look easy but II am sure it isn't really that easy.
I wonder who they will play next.
Time will tell.  We have to wait to find out.
Who do you think will be in the final game?
Cleveland, for sure!
And who will they play?
I do not know.  I hope it isn't Golden State.
Well, I think it will be Golden State.
A repeat of last year!
Another championship for Cleveland!
That would be great!
That means another championship parade.
Let's plan to go to the parade!
Go Cavs!!!
Go Cavs!!!
