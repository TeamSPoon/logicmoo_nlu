What's your favorite activity to do to music.
You might not have heard of it, but I love Dance Dance Revolution.
What's that?
It's an arcade rhythm and beat game where you use your feet to hit arrows that are synchronized to the beat of a song. It's like a dancing game.
Oh I've seen that. A huge metal machine with arrows flying on the screen.
Yep that's it. It's really fun and great exercise.
I bet. Are you good at it?
I actually compete in DDR competitions.
Wow that's crazy. What's your favorite part about DDR?
The music. I love all of the pop, dancy, techno music on DDR.
There must be some crazy stuff on that.
Especially since it's a Japanese company Konami, that makes the game.
Are all the songs in Japanese?
No, they're in English actually, but they have an Asian feel to them.
I never would have guessed you liked music with an Asian feel.
Hey! I like to dance to music with an Asian feel.
That's funny to hear.
You should try to play DDR with me sometime
Oh no! I'll be horrrible.
Trust me. It's good exercise and it's fun.
