Have you seen any good movies lately?
I saw the new smurfs movie.
Oh wow how was that?
I liked it, I got a good laugh out of it.
But isn't that movie for kids though?
Yes technically it is but I still got a good laugh out of it.
That is wonderful. I should check it out.
Definitely.
I don't usually like animated films but that one was pretty good.
Have you seen Baywatch yet?
No but I want to.
I heard it did not get good reviews though.
Yeah but you cannot always go by that.
Very true actually.
I want to see a horror film though soon.
Me too.
Let's go see one together.
Sounds like a plan.
Well it was great speaking to you.
Same!
