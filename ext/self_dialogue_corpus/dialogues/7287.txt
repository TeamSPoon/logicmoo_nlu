Aladdin was my favorite movie as a kid
did you ever wish you found a magic lamp?
all of the time, I would always think of my three wishes
I know, but the genie could be tricky
Yes, you had to word what you wanted just right!
I also thought a magic carpet would be cool
I used to pretend that our area rug was magic and I could fly
That movie was full of really neat things
It was the genie was kind of scary though
yeah he was, I wonder why he was blue?!
