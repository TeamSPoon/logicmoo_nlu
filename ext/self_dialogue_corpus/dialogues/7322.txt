Holes is a movie all about luck, wouldn't you say?
What do you mean?
Well, luck comes into every single part of that movie.
What's an example?
Like bad luck when Zero throws those shoes on Stanley Yelnats' head.
Yeah I guess so.
And good luck when they come across that water and onions on God's thumb after climbing the mountain.
That also was about luck I guess.
In the end, Stanley and Zero got all good luck basically.
And Mr. Sir got TERRIBLE luck. Haha
