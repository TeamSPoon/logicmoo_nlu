Were you able to watch that new documentary about The Eagles?
Sure did! My dad and I watched the entire thing a few nights ago.
No way! I watched it with my dad also, he's a huge Eagles fan.
I think any man born in the 1960's is an Eagles fan. Their music is still amazing today. What's your favorite song?
Hard choice but I really enjoy listening to Life in the Fast Lane. It gets me pumped when I'm riding my motorcycle.
I love that song too but Hotel California is still my all time favorite.
I think both songs were released on the same album.
Indeed they were. The album is called Hotel California. It was released in 1976.
If I'm not mistaken, that album is one of the greatest selling albums of all time.
With 32 million copies sold world wide, I'd say you are correct my friend.
