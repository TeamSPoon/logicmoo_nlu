Have you seen the movie It?
I think I have, it is creepy.
Yeah, the girl in there is weird.
They worked on that movie for six years.
Yeah I think it is a book by Stephen King.
Yeah, I have read the book.
The book is way better than the movie.
That is usually how it turns out.
I am excited to see the new remake of the movie though.
Me too because it has an interesting plot.
