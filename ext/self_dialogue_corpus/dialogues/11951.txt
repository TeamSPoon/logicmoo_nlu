Did you see The Empire Strikes Back?
Yes, it was awesome.
What was your favorite part?
I love the Yoda scene when he first appears.
Do you think he was testing Luke's patience with R2-D2 in that scene?
Of course. Every move was calculated.
Did you like the love story?
Yes, Han and the princess were great together.
Did you like the original actor that played the emperor?
Yeah, I think there was a woman that wore the costume and a man that did the voice.
